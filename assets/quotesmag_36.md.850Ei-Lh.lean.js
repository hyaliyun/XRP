Among the many organizations of which she was a member, the \\"\\" (an artists' society for women) and the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund are especially notable. In 1914, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig, she displayed two graphic works at the \\"Internationalen Ausstellung f√ºr Buchgewerbe und Grafik\\" (BUGRA) and was awarded a gold medal. At the beginning of the 1920s, she helped Henni Lehmann create the Blaue Scheune, an exhibition venue in Hiddensee, where she later took up residence.Clara Arnheim @ Galerie Der Panther. An organization known as the \\"\\" was established, which numbered Elisabeth Andrae, K√§the Loewenthal, and Elisabeth B√ºchsel among its members. Following the Nazi seizure of power, she was served with a Berufsverbot and was unable to exhibit or accept commissions. Over the years, the harassment worsened until she found it almost impossible to obtain ration stamps. Luckily, her friends in Hiddensee were able to supply her with food in secret. The establishment of a ban against travel by Jews came while she was on a visit. Unable to return home, her resources dwindled and, in July 1942, she was transported to Theresienstadt, where she was put to death a few weeks later.

She was the first woman knighted in Barbados for her long dedication to education and the nation. Early life Elsie Pilgrim was born on 14 May 1927 in Bridgetown, Saint Michael Parish, Barbados to S.O. Pilgrim, a shoe merchant in Bridgetown. Her ancestry included Charles Pilgrim, who was at one time the headmaster of Combermere School. Pilgrim entered Queen's College at the age of nine and continued to her graduation. In 1946, Pilgrim won the Barbados Government Scholarship, the first time the scholarship had been awarded to a woman. She continued her university studies at Exeter College, then a part of the University of London, earning a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1949. Furthering her education, Pilgrim then enrolled at the University of Cambridge, attaining a PhD in history. Career Pilgrim returned to Barbados and began her teaching career at Queen's College in 1952 and the following year married Dr. David O. Payne. She was known as an excellent teacher and in a time when the history of the British West Indies was not typically a part of the curriculum, Payne taught about slavery in the Caribbean. In 1966, Payne was appointed as deputy headmistress of Queen's College. When Barbadian teachers struck in 1969, over a salary and working conditions dispute with the Ministry of Education, Payne became the spokesman for the teachers and the Barbados Secondary Teachers' Union. The nature of the conflict was that teachers who had been appointed to the staff of the newly opened Barbados Community College were offered different salaries and conditions than teachers who were equally qualified and were employed in secondary schools. The dispute became heated, with threats of firing, loss of pension and other benefits from Prime Minister Errol Barrow. Payne and the teachers stood resolute and gained the concessions for which they fought, resulting in an overhaul and reform of Barbados' educational system. In 1970, Payne became the first Barbadian-born principal of the school and the following year was one of the founders of the Parent-Teacher Association. In addition to her work at Queen's College, Payne served on several national education boards, the Barbados Constitution Review Commission, the Barbados Privy Council, as well as providing lectures at the Centre for Multi-Racial Studies under the auspices of the University of the West Indies and the University of Sussex. Serving on the Council of the University of the West Indies from 1973, she served as the Council Chair in 1987. For her many contributions to education and the nation, Payne was knighted in 1980, becoming the first woman honoured by the Order of St. Andrew. She continued leading Queen's College until her retirement in 1985. Death and legacy Payne died on 25 August 2004 in Bridgetown, Barbados. The buildings of Queen's College were renamed to honour the four Barbadian-born headmistresses in 2007, including one named after Payne. In addition, the headquarters of the Ministry of Education are named in her honour, as is a roundabout near the Bridgetown Port. In 2016, Payne was honoured as one of Barbados' best public officers and included in a special publication Challenge to Change issued by the Office of Public Sector Reform.

It was the deadliest day for the FDNY since the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001 and particularly shocking since two different deadly fires occurred on the same day. Bronx fire The Bronx fire started on the third floor of a tenement on East 178th Street off the Grand Concourse, and may have been caused by an extension cord to a portable heater setting fire to a mattress. Three alarms were called: Engine Company 42, Ladder Company 33, Ladder Company 27, and Rescue Company 3 were involved in fighting the fire. The alarm call was made at 7:59 on a cold, windy morning the day after a blizzard, and snow hampered the engines in reaching the address; the closest hydrant was frozen, and some hoses were either frozen or cracked. The apartments had been illegally subdivided using drywall partitions. Six firefighters on the fourth floor were trapped when the fire flashed through the door of the apartment, unable to find their way to the fire escape, and decided to jump from windows. Only two had an escape rope, which one of them had bought for himself. Two were killed in the fall: John G. Bellew and Lieutenant Curtis W. Meyran, who was in command of Ladder 27. The other four, Brendan Cawley, Jeff Cool, Joe DiBernardo, and Gene Stolowski, were severely injured and disabled and had to retire. DiBernardo died six years later; he had been promoted to lieutenant in May 2005 and Bellew received a posthumous promotion. Brooklyn fire The Brooklyn fire, later the same day, was in the basement of a two-family house on Jerome Street in East New York. People attending a birthday party reported smelling smoke; a group of firefighters from Ladder Company 103 who were investigating withdrew from the basement when the heat became too intense, but one, Richard T. Sclafani, did not come out and was found unconscious on the stairs after apparently catching his equipment on a coat rack. He was pronounced dead at Brookdale Medical Center, bringing the total number of firefighter deaths that day to three, the highest number in one day since the 9-11 attack on the World Trade Center and, unusually, in two separate fires. Aftermath of Bronx fire The FDNY issued personal safety ropes to firefighters until 2000, when it discontinued the practice saying that they were too bulky and were not being used. The department's official report on the fire, issued in September 2005, stated that ropes would have been helpful, and they were issued again starting a month later; since 2006 FDNY firefighters have been equipped with a hook, a rope and a sliding mechanism. The report also blamed the firefighters for poor communication and for remaining too long on the fourth floor given the conditions, and those operating the pump for poor understanding of the equipment. The FDNY assigned a large part of the blame for the deaths to the building code violation for the subdivision of the apartment. The Bronx County District Attorney charged the landlord and two tenants in connection with the deaths. In criminal trials in 2009 the tenants, who had erected the partition, were found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment, while two former owners of the building were found guilty, but the verdict was reversed a year later. The surviving firefighters and the families of those who were killed announced their intention to file lawsuits against the city over the lack of safety ropes. The civil suit began in September 2015. Meyran's family reached a settlement; in February 2016 a New York State Supreme Court jury awarded damages of $183 million to the remaining five, of which approximately $140 million was to be paid by the city and the rest by one of the former owners. The families had reached a settlement with the former owner shortly before and, in September 2016, settled with the city for $29.5 million. Annually, friends, family and colleagues gather on a January Saturday morning for an 11am memorial mass and service at Brooklyn Ladder 103 and Bronx Engine 46 Ladder 27 to pay homage to the trio. NYC FDNY Plaque Ceremony 2006 New York City Fire Department (FDNY) dedicated a plaque honoring Lieutenants John Bellew and Curtis Meyran a year after Black Sunday. Hundreds of firefighters from the City joined family and friends standing in the rain without complaint. New York City Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said ‚ÄúThe plaque dedication is a Department tradition; a way we pay respect to our lost firefighters. It is the Department‚Äôs way of reaffirming the promise each and every firefighter makes to his fellow firefighter. It is another way of saying we will never forget. It is our job today, and in the days to come, to ensure that they are not forgotten ‚Äì to continue the work of these men.‚Äù Terry Bellew, John's brother spoke: ‚ÄúThese men were doing what they loved when they met their fate.‚Äù Richard Sclafani had a similarly well attended ceremony at the Brooklyn firehouse attended by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The Mayor said, ‚ÄúEvery day, firefighters risk their lives for people they‚Äôve never met. January 23 was no different. These men will always be remembered as heroes.‚Äù Mayor Bloomberg held Firefighter Sclafani's mother's hand whilst his sister spoke: ‚ÄúI have always felt the strength of my brother. We will always love him and we will never forget.‚Äù References External links * In memory of Joey DiBernardo * Building fires in New York City New York City Fire Department Deaths from fire in the United States Firefighting January 2005 events in the United States Morris Heights, Bronx East New York, Brooklyn Residential building fires ","title":"Black Sunday (2005)"},{"id":"52823403","text":"Jerry Bookout (November 2, 1933 - February 22, 2006) was an American politician and funeral director.

She is known for her work educating young women and for advancing a moral philosophy that advocated living a virtuous life, rather than one based on rules and punishment. Life Favre was born Caroline Julie √âmilie Velten in Wissembourg in the north-eastern part of France to Michel Velten and Caroline Louise Weber. Her father was a Lutheran minister.Archives du Bas-Rhin, √âtat-civil de Wissembourg As a child she disagreed with the imposition of religious practices and was greatly affected by the French Revolution of 1848, which happened when she was thirteen years old. Velten grew to believe strongly in freedom and self- determination. Professional life Not long after completing her teaching degree in Wissembourg, Velten became head assistant of a boarding school in Paris. Run by a Mme. Fr√®rejean, this Protestant school emphasized the personal will and good mental habits over strict punishment or rigid oversight. Velten was highly influenced by this educational approach. After Fr√®rejean's death in 1860, Velten became director of the school. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out and northeastern France was occupied by German forces. Velten stayed at the school with students who were unable to leave. Portrait of Jules Favre. Velten married Jules Favre, a public official who was active in the French Third Republic, in 1871. The couple traveled often, and Velten Favre used this time to translate various German and Swiss books into French. She also was an intellectual equal of her husband and contributed to his works. In the preface of one of his books, he said of her, \\"Her name ought to be beside mine on all the works to which over the last four years she has so faithfully contributed and for which I found, in her mind and heart, the surest guide.\\" Jules Favre died in January 1880, and in the following years she compiled, edited and completed his works into several volumes. In 1883 she wrote a defense of her husband's career, which some at the time viewed in a negative light. In 1881, Jules Ferry, the French Minister of National Education, named Velten Favre director of the √àcole Normale Sup√©rieure de S√®vres. Ferry was a champion of secular public education, and Velten Favre was well suited to lead the movement for French women to receive secondary education, despite a skeptical public. Velten Favre continued to teach at the school until she died in 1896. Philosophy As an educator, Velten Favre frequently pulled excerpts from classical and modern philosophers such as Aristotle, the Stoics, Plato, Socrates, Moli√®re and Ralph Waldo Emerson for her students to read and discuss. Her own works grew from this educational background and were mainly written in the 1880s. She believed in universal morality, encouraging her students to live educated, moral lives. Personally she considered moral law to have foundations in the Christian perspective, but she also wrote that moral truth could be found outside of Christianity. In particular, Velten Favre wrote that one is first a moral citizen, and only secondarily is a member of a country or family. This places men and women as equals. Velten Favre believed that women had a particular vocation to teach morality, which necessitates that women receive a broad and complete education.

In agriculture, its sodium salt, dikegulac sodium, is used as a plant growth regulator, primarily used as a branching agent. When it is taken up by a plant, dikegulac sodium is translocated to its apical meristems, where it inhibits DNA synthesis. This suppresses apical dominance in the plant and can stimulate lateral branching, resulting in a bushier growth habit. Dikegulac sodium is sometimes used to inhibit fruiting and flowering. Application methods Dikegulac sodium can be applied as a foliar spray or a trunk injection. Phytotoxicity Dikegulac sodium application often causes phytotoxicity. Symptoms include chlorosis and stunted growth. When higher concentrations are applied, there is a greater risk that these adverse effects will persist, leading to crop loss. Reversing growth inhibition Gibberellins can be applied to fight undesired growth inhibition following dikegulac sodium application, but success can be limited. Regulations Plant protection products containing dikegulac were phased out in the European Union after the European Commission decided in 2002 not to include the chemical in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Dikegulac sodium is approved for EPA registration in the United States. Commercial formulations Commercial formulations available in the United States include Atrimmec, Augeo, and Pinscher. Ginkgo Gate In Fall 2008, Washington, D.C.'s Urban Forestry Administration failed to suppress the fruiting of thousands of female Ginkgo biloba trees by injecting them with the dikegulac sodium product Pinscher. Ginkgo biloba is a dioecious plant. Because the females are well known for their foul smelling fruit, the non-fruiting males are usually recommended for landscape use. However, these city trees were installed before Ginkgo saplings could easily be sexed, so many planted were female. The Urban Forestry Administration had previously sprayed the trees with chlorpropham to prevent fruiting, but their success had been limited. When the dikegulac sodium injection was unsuccessful, the fruit matured and dropped from the trees. Some referred to the failure as \\"Ginkgo Gate\\".

The former CEO of Skjoldnes Holding Inc., a property development company, he has worked in a wide range of business sectors. Bergensavisen noted in 2015 that he \\"has been involved in social causes as long as he can remember and has spent much of his adult life in human-rights work.\\" A former chairman of the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights and of the Rafto Prize Committee, he is currently a council member of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee. Education Born and raised in Bergen, Lynng√•rd studied at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) beginning in 1986, receiving a Master of Science (MSc) in Economics in 1990 and an Executive MBA in Management Control in 1996. Career Rafto Foundation His connection with the Bergen-based Rafto Human Rights Foundation, named for Thorolf Rafto, professor of economic history at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen, began in 1997. From that year until 2002, Lynng√•rd was a board member of the foundation; from 2002 to 2007 he was chairman of the foundation's board; from 2002 to 2009 he was also chair of the foundation's Rafto Prize Committee, which selects the winners of the Rafto Prize for Human Rights. In July 2005, Lynng√•rd and four other human-rights activists were deported from the Western Sahara. They had traveled to the capital of the region, Laayoune, to gather information about human-rights violations, meet activist Latif Allal, and witness the trial of 16 young defendants. After they contacted Allal, Allal was arrested, beaten, and then set free. Also, before Lynng√•rd and his colleagues could attend the trial, they were summoned to the local police department and ordered by the police chief to leave the Western Sahara. That night, after having failed to leave, they were physically thrown out of their hotel shortly after midnight by armed riot police. They were then placed in two cabs and driven to Agadir, Morocco, 10‚Äì12 hours away. In March 2007, Lynng√•rd was planning to visit Vietnamese dissident Thich Quang Do, deputy head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who had been under \\"pagoda arrest\\" since 1998, to present him with the Rafto Prize. In February, however, the Vietnamese embassy in Copenhagen sent a letter to the Rafto Foundation stating that it would not permit such a meeting on the grounds that the foundation had damaged relations between Norway and Vietnam. In reply to the letter, the Rafto Foundation issued a statement to the effect that the purpose of Lynng√•rd's visit to Vietnam was not just to visit Thich Quang Do but also to meet with Vietnamese officials and learn about Vietnam's efforts to develop a democratic system. In March, Lynng√•rd's wife, Therese Jebsen, who also worked for Rafto, went to Vietnam and was arrested by military police along with another activist and two reporters for Norway's TV2. In 2009, Lynng√•rd spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum about the ongoing cultural genocide of the Uighur people by the government of China. In December 2014, he stated that the treatment of the Uighur people had gone \\"from bad to worse\\" and that the international community had a duty to remind Chinese leaders of their obligations under agreements with other countries. He also said that when top Western politicians refuse to meet with the Dalai Lama, they were sending the wrong signal. SIU, Skjoldnes, and Econa Lynng√•rd was director of the Norwegian Center for International Cooperation in Education (SIU), based in Bergen, from September 2009 to September 2010. He was CEO of Skjoldnes Holding AS, also based in Bergen, from October 2010 to May 2015, and deputy member of Skjolnes Holding's board from May 2013 to June 2015. From September 2014 to May 2015 he was vice chairman of the Board at Econa; since May 2015, he has been chairman of Econa's board. In April 2015, after being elected board chairman of Econa, he said that he was eager to defend the professional status of economists and to bring greater visibility to their role in society. He was a deputy member of the board of the Bergen Academy of Art and Design from 2011 to December 2015. Church City Mission Since June 2015, he has been executive director of the Church City Mission in Bergen. It has approximately 100 employees and 300 volunteers and is affiliated with the Church of Norway. In May 2015, just before he began working for the Church City Mission, Lynng√•rd said that when he had seen the advertisement for the position, he thought of something Eleanor Roosevelt had said: \\"Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places...so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world...[in] the neighborhood...the school or college...the work[place].\\" Lynng√•rd said that in many ways, the Church City Mission is \\"an answer to Eleanor Roosevelt's challenge.\\" When Lynng√•rd took up this position, it was noted that the head of the Church City Mission traditionally remains in the job for 17 years, and that this meant Lynng√•rd might hold it until he reached retirement age. Personal life He is married to Therese Jebsen.

The deal was finalized after a week-long meeting held in Glion, Switzerland, co-chaired by UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths. The prisoner-swap deal was done by the UN during 2018 peace talks in Sweden and both parties were agreed on several measures including the cease-fire in the strategic port city of Hodeida. A prisoner swap deal was made as part of the 2018 peace talks held in Sweden. However, the implementation of the plan clashed with military offensives from Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition, which aggravated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, leaving millions suffering medical and food supply shortages.

Its aim was to educate women about socialism by discussing women's issues from a socialist standpoint. It was renamed The Progressive Woman in 1909 and The Coming Nation in 1913. Its contributors included Socialist Party activist Kate Richards O'Hare, suffragist Alice Stone Blackwell, orator Eugene V. Debs, poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and other notable writers and activists. History Josephine Conger-Kaneko founded The Socialist Woman when she was living in Chicago, home of the national office of the Socialist Party of America. When she published the first issue in June 1907, she had only 26 subscribers. At the time, only about 2,000 women belonged to the male-dominated Socialist Party, and party leaders made little effort to welcome women or address their concerns. Conger-Kaneko believed that women were essential to the success of the socialist movement, and set out to educate women about socialism by creating a magazine that would appeal to a female audience: > The Socialist Woman exists for the sole purpose of bringing women into touch > with the Socialist idea. We intend to make this paper a forum for the > discussion of problems that lie closest to women's lives, from the Socialist > standpoint. Both Conger-Kaneko and her husband, Kiichi Kaneko, were feminists who supported the women's suffrage movement, and the magazine reflected their views. Conger wrote editorials, poetry, and news articles about socialism and women's rights. Before his death in 1909, Kaneko co-edited the magazine and contributed essays on women's issues around the world. Many noted activists and writers contributed to the magazine, including Socialist Party activist Kate Richards O'Hare, suffragist Alice Stone Blackwell, union leader Eugene V. Debs, and poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox, among others. The magazine received no funding from the Socialist Party, and supplemented its subscription fees by carrying advertisements for books, periodicals, anti-Catholic tracts, hair tonics, patent medicines, and the like. Conger-Kaneko wanted to reach as broad an audience as possible, and she often printed articles by suffragists whether they were socialists or not. Racial equality and issues such as lynching were rarely mentioned, however, and contributors often displayed the casual racism that was common among American whites at the time. In 1908, Conger-Kaneko and her husband moved to Girard, Kansas. The Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper for which she had edited a women's column, was based in Girard, and its publishing house agreed to produce The Socialist Woman free of charge. The move freed Conger-Kaneko to focus more of her attention on editing, and over the next year she made several changes designed to bring in new readers. She began publishing fictional stories as well as news, and published special issues devoted to teachers, temperance, and child labor. The Progressive Woman Hoping to reach new readers, Conger-Kaneko changed the magazine's name to The Progressive Woman in March 1909. The change had the desired result, and by 1910 The Progressive Woman had between 12,000 and 15,000 subscribers, reaching readers as far away as Japan, Australia, China, Mexico, Canada, and Sweden. Special issues sold as many as 18,000 copies. In 1910 she published a controversial issue on \\"white slavery\\" (forced prostitution) and nearly lost her mailing privileges. When the Appeal to Reason reorganized in 1911, she had to look elsewhere for a publisher. She returned to Chicago, where she reached an agreement with the Woman's National Committee (WNC) of the Socialist Party whereby they would provide limited financial support for the magazine. The Coming Nation In October 1913, she renamed the magazine The Coming Nation, stating that there was no longer any need to target a specifically female audience. (Another magazine by the same name was defunct by that time.) The magazine fell victim to political infighting within the WNC, and its last issue was published in July 1914.

Biography  A native of Carrollton, Missouri, Austin studied from 1877 to 1879 at the University of Missouri, becoming a favored pupil of George Caleb Bingham, to whom she gave two of her paintings. In 1879 she moved to Sacramento, home of her great-uncle, Jefferson Wilcoxson; he was ill, and in return for her care he provided money for her to continue her training, which she did in the studio of Norton Bush. Her first exposure came at the 1880 California State Fair, where her drawings won praise from the critic of The Sacramento Bee. The following year at the Fair, the showing of her Morning Glories brought her a measure of notoriety. In May 1882 she enrolled in the San Francisco School of Design; she continued to exhibit regularly in Sacramento at this point, and also at the San Francisco Art Association, where she received a gold medal and an honorable mention. Later in 1885 she taught for a few months at the School of Design in Sacrament; on January 16, 1886 she opened her own studio in that town's Oddfellows building. Her painting class attracted many students. In 1908 Austin went to Paris, where she kept a studio until 1912 and studied with Jean Escoula and Emile Renard. Here she began to work at sculpture, and in 1909 a marble bust of Miss Quinn was accepted for show at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Its exhibition won her a place in the Union Internationale des Beaux-Artes et des Lettres. In 1912 she returned to Sacramento; Miss Quinn along with other works, was exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. With another sculpture it then traveled to exhibits at the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1916, with a commission in hand from the city of Sacramento, Austin returned once more to Paris to execute a monument, only to be told by her doctor to return as she was dying of cancer. En route, she died in New York City, three days before turning fifty-eight. On her deathbed Austin married E. Lee Allen. She left all her property to him in her will, but her family contested it. The result was that her works were divided up and her legacy fell into obscurity. Morning Glories, currently among her works in the collection of the Crocker Art Museum, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987.

The Harbor Defenses of Portland was a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps harbor defense command. It coordinated the coast defenses of Portland, Maine, the mouth of the Kennebec River, and surrounding areas from 1895 to 1950, beginning with the Endicott program. These included both coast artillery forts and underwater minefields. The command originated circa 1895 as the Portland Artillery District, was renamed Coast Defenses of Portland in 1913, and again renamed Harbor Defenses of Portland in 1925.Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group websiteRinaldi, pp. 165-166Berhow, p. 430-434Stanton, pp. 455-481 Coast Defenses of the Kennebec The Kennebec coast defense command may have originated as the Kennebec Artillery District with the establishment of Endicott program minefield support facilities in the 1890s at the Civil War- era Fort Popham in Phippsburg,Fort Popham at NorthAmericanForts.com and deployment of mines there during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing Office However, it is unclear from references whether the Coast Defenses of the Kennebec (as it was probably renamed in 1913) was ever a command independent of the Coast Defenses of Portland. At some time prior to 1917 the commands were merged. Between 1905 and 1912 Fort Baldwin was built near Fort Popham, during the Taft Program period. It was one of the smallest forts of the era, with three 6-inch guns and two 3-inch guns. During World War I these forts were garrisoned by two companies of the Coast Defenses of Portland (CD Portland),NRIS entry for Fort Baldwin and references do not show the Kennebec command active during that war or in World War II. Fort Baldwin was disarmed in 1924, although the minefield capability at Fort Popham may have been retained through World War II. Fort Baldwin was rearmed with a battery of four towed 155 mm guns on \\"Panama mounts\\" in World War II, operated by Battery D of the 8th Coast Artillery.Fort Baldwin at FortWiki.com Some references list Forts Popham and Baldwin with the Harbor Defenses of the Kennebec due to their geographical separation from the Portland area and to be consistent with other fort listings.Berhow, pp. 204-205 History Early Portland forts A Revolutionary War battery existed on the site of Fort Allen Park, and some sources state that it was named Fort Allen at that time.Fort Allen at FortWiki.comRoberts, p. 357 In 1794 Fort Sumner was built on Munjoy Hill in Portland, with a blockhouse at the current Standpipe Park and a water battery or \\"detached battery\\", possibly on the site of Fort Allen. Fort Sumner was part of the first system of US fortifications.Portland forts at NorthAmericanForts.comWade, pp. 15, 241 Additional fortifications were built under the second system of US fortifications, with Fort Preble and Fort Scammell completed in 1809.Wade, pp. 139, 241 Fort Preble was in what was then the northern part of Cape Elizabeth, which is now South Portland. Fort Scammell (a.k.a. Fort Scammel) was on House Island, across from Fort Preble. These forts were built due to a war scare with the British, and their construction coincided with the deeply unpopular Embargo Act of 1807, which emerged from the same war scare and prohibited the lucrative trade with Britain and France. The first use the forts were put to was enforcement of the embargo, so the forts' existence was locally suspect.Smith, pp. 143-154Wade, p. 131 During the War of 1812 (which broke out due to the same tensions with Britain) the city of Portland refurbished and rearmed Fort Allen with city resources, due to the British capture of Eastport and Castine as the short-lived colony of New Ireland. Fort Preble was expanded with new batteries in 1845,Fort Preble at FortWiki.com and Fort Scammell's walls were extended around this time.Fort Scammell at FortWiki.com In 1858-62 construction began on additional fortifications in Portland harbor, part of the third system of US fortifications. The construction of Fort Gorges on a small ledge island to the north of House Island began in 1858.Weaver, pp. 90‚Äì95 After the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, a complete rebuilding of Fort Scammell and a modernization of Fort Preble began in 1862.Weaver, pp. 93‚Äì100 By the end of the war Fort Gorges was largely complete, while the design of Fort Scammell was cut back to allow completion; Fort Preble's third system batteries were never completed or armed. All three of these forts were modified in the 1870s to provide earthwork-protected batteries for Rodman guns; in the case of Fort Gorges these were on the roof.Fort Gorges at FortWiki.com However, funding was cut off in 1876 with the program partially complete, and it was over 20 years before the modern gun batteries of the Endicott program were completed.Berhow, pp. 54-57 The only enemy action in Portland harbor since the Revolutionary War occurred on 27 June 1863 and was called the Battle of Portland Harbor or the Caleb Cushing affair. Confederate raiders on CSS Tacony, pursued by the Union Navy, captured a fishing vessel named Archer and set fire to Tacony to evade pursuit. They were successful, and infiltrated the port of Portland on Archer. They then seized the Revenue Service cutter Caleb Cushing and attempted to flee the harbor in it along with Archer. A group of about 30 soldiers from Fort Preble and 100 civilians (issued muskets at the fort) commandeered a pair of steamships with a light artillery piece on each one. It appears the Confederates avoided the forts, but soon the wind shifted against them and the Union's steamships closed in. With their capture imminent, the Confederates set fire to Cushings magazines and abandoned the ship before it blew up. All the Confederates were captured and imprisoned.Morison, p. 644Harper's Weekly, 11 July 1863 Endicott period As recommended by the Endicott Board of 1885, construction began in 1893 on five forts to defend Portland harbor. After the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, several gun batteries were hastily emplaced, as most of the Endicott batteries were still years from completion. It was feared that the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. The locations of most of these batteries, except one 6-inch Armstrong gun at Fort Williams, are unclear, but Fort Preble and Fort McKinley are the most likely sites. A total of six 8-inch M1888 breech-loading guns on converted Rodman carriages, along with a pair of muzzle-loading 8-inch converted Rodman rifles, were emplaced.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing Office The 8-inch batteries were disarmed soon after the war, as their weapons were either needed in the Endicott system or were obsolete. The 6-inch battery remained in place until 1913. By 1903 the heavy Endicott gun and mortar batteries were complete, with all batteries complete by 1906. The southern harbor entrance was defended by three forts: Fort Williams in Cape Elizabeth with Fort Levett (sometimes misspelled Fort Leavitt) on Cushing Island at the harbor's mouth, and a totally rebuilt Fort Preble in South Portland further up the channel. The northern entrance was defended by Fort McKinley on Great Diamond Island with Fort Lyon on nearby Cow Island.Map of Harbor Defenses of Portland at FortWiki.com Two underwater minefields also guarded the harbor entrances. Fort Williams had two 12-inch (305 mm) and five 10-inch (254 mm) guns, Fort Levett had three 12-inch and two 10-inch guns, Fort Preble had sixteen 12-inch mortars, and Fort McKinley had eight 12-inch mortars, two 12-inch guns, and eight 8-inch (203 mm) guns. Each fort also had two or four 6-inch (152 mm) guns and between two and four 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Fort Lyon was the smallest with three 6-inch guns and three 3-inch guns.Berhow, pp. 204-205 World War I The American entry into World War I brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and CD Portland. As the only component of the Army with heavy artillery experience and significant manpower, the Coast Artillery was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war. Stateside garrisons were drawn down to provide experienced gun crews on the Western Front. Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were converted to railway artillery,US Army Railway Guns in World War I while 5-inch and 6-inch guns became field guns on wheeled carriages.Williford, pp. 92-99 However, few railway artillery pieces were mounted and few or none saw action before the Armistice. The remounted 5-inch and 6-inch guns were sent to France, but their units did not complete training in time to see action.Coast Artillery Corps Units in France in WWI Two 10-inch guns from Fort Williams and seven 6-inch guns from Forts Williams, McKinley, and Lyon were removed; after the war the 10-inch guns and two of Fort McKinley's 6-inch guns were returned.Fort Williams at FortWiki.comFort McKinley at FortWiki.com The mortar batteries at Forts Preble and McKinley were permanently halved, both to provide railway mortars and increase the rate of fire of the remaining mortars (by reducing overcrowding in the mortar pits). At all the forts, numerous temporary buildings were constructed to accommodate the large influx of new recruits. References indicate the authorized strength of CD Portland was 29 companies, including 13 from the Maine National Guard. Nine of these 13 companies were used to form the bulk of the 54th Coast Artillery, a regiment that was sent to France and slated to be armed with 24 6-inch guns. However, on 20 September 1918 the regiment became a training and replacement unit. In March 1919, with the war over, the regiment returned to the United States and was inactivated.United States Army, p. 98Rinaldi, p. 162 Interwar 12-inch casemated gun, similar to those at Battery Foote, Fort Levett. In January 1921 Battery Foote at Fort Levett was completed; this was a battery of two 12-inch (305 mm) guns on long-range barbette carriages that increased the guns' range from to .Berhow, p. 61 The battery originally had open mounts, but was casemated in World War II.Fort Levett at FortWiki.com On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\". The 8th Coast Artillery was the Regular Army component of the Harbor Defenses of Portland from 1 July 1924 through 25 February 1944, and the 240th Coast Artillery was the Maine National Guard component from 1924 through 5 October 1944. During this period towed 155 mm (6.1 inch) guns were based at Fort Williams, which served through World War II, according to a plaque on the site. World War II 16-inch casemated gun, similar to Battery Steele. Early in World War II the coastal forts were expanded with numerous temporary buildings to accommodate rapid mobilization of men and equipment. The 240th Coast Artillery was activated on 16 September 1940. After the Fall of France in 1940 the Army decided to replace all existing heavy coast defense guns with 16-inch guns. In 1942 construction began on Battery Steele (also called Battery 102) at the Peaks Island Military Reservation with two 16-inch (406 mm) guns; this battery was substantially complete by late 1944. HD Portland became centered on Peaks Island, the 12-inch (305 mm) Battery Foote, and the minefields. Except for a few of the 6-inch (152 mm) and 3-inch (76 mm) guns, the Endicott-era weapons were scrapped in 1942-44. To supplement the heavy batteries, three batteries of two 6-inch guns each on long-range mountings were constructed, on Peaks Island, the Cape Elizabeth Military Reservation at Two Lights, and the Jewell Island Military Reservation. However, only the Peaks Island battery was armed. Two older 2-gun 6-inch batteries were retained at Forts McKinley and Levett. Three old 3-inch gun batteries were retained at Forts Williams, Preble, and Lyon, while three new 3-inch gun batteries were built on Peaks Island, Long Island, and Great Chebeague Island. An additional 16-inch battery was projected for Cape Elizabeth but never built. Ten Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries were also emplaced at various locations in Casco Bay; these had an authorized strength of four 90 mm guns (two on fixed mounts, two on towed mounts) and two 40 mm Bofors guns. The guns were dual-purpose, able to fire against air or surface targets. The batteries were at Long Island (2), Great Chebeague Island (1), Bailey Island (1), Peaks Island (2), Jewell Island (2), Fort Levett (1), and Fort Williams (1). Battery D, 8th Coast Artillery with four towed 155 mm guns was deployed to Fort Baldwin 1942-1944, and a similar two-gun battery was deployed to Biddeford Pool Military Reservation 1942-1945.Biddeford Pool Military Reservation at FortWiki.com With greatly reduced manpower requirements, on 25 February 1944 most of the 8th Coast Artillery's personnel were reassigned to HD Portland and the remaining personnel reassigned elsewhere. On 5 October 1944 the 240th Coast Artillery was redesignated as the 185th and 186th Coast Artillery battalions, as part of an Army-wide move to a battalion-based organization; these units were inactivated on 1 April 1945.Stanton, p. 489 Following mobilization in 1940 HD Portland was subordinate to First Army. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. This command was disestablished in 1946.Conn, pp. 33-35 The US Navy also participated in defending Casco Bay with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, with stations at Fort Williams, Peaks Island (Station 1F), Cape Elizabeth (Two Lights) (Station 1B), and Bailey Island (Station 1A).Indicator loops in Casco Bay, Maine Although it was a major naval anchorage, the Casco Bay area saw action only once in World War II. USS Eagle 56 (PE-56) exploded and sank a few miles east of the Cape Elizabeth Military Reservation on 23 April 1945. Despite some evidence of an enemy submarine in the area, a Court of Inquiry initially attributed this to a boiler explosion. However, in 2001 the Navy determined that Eagle 56 was torpedoed by U-853, a German U-boat that was later sunk in the Battle of Point Judith, Rhode Island on 5-6 May 1945, two days before Germany's surrender. Post World War II Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped within a few years. By 1948 this was complete, and the remaining coast defense functions were turned over to the Navy. On 1 January 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were finally dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. Present As of 2016, Fort Allen Park includes two reconstructed revetments with Civil War-era guns and several war memorials, notably a 6-inch gun from and the foremast and bridge shield of . No trace remains of Fort Sumner's blockhouse. Fort Preble is the campus of Southern Maine Community College, with some batteries and numerous garrison buildings intact, along with good views of Fort Scammell and Fort Gorges. Fort Gorges can be visited by boat, and has an unmounted 300-pounder (10-inch) Parrott rifle on the roof. Forts Scammell and Levett are well-preserved, but are on private islands that require advance permission to visit. Battery Steele and the 6-inch battery on Peaks Island are also well- preserved; the 6-inch battery has been converted into part of a private residence. The 6-inch batteries on Jewell Island and at Two Lights State Park (formerly the Cape Elizabeth Military Reservation) remain, and the battery at Two Lights has an interpretive plaque with an interior diagram. Several fire control towers remain at various locations around Casco Bay. Fort Williams has become Fort Williams Park of the town of Cape Elizabeth; most of the batteries were buried and most of the garrison buildings demolished in the 1980s to make room for green space. One 12-inch gun position is only partly buried, and the 3-inch Battery Keyes is preserved intact. Fort McKinley and its garrison buildings are largely intact, although most of the gun positions are overgrown. Forts Popham and Baldwin are well-preserved, with Fort Baldwin open to the public, while the interior of Fort Popham can be viewed from the back.

The French military operation Op√©ration Sentinelle has been ongoing in France since the January 2015 √éle-de-France attacks. Background Prior to the attacks, the 2005 French riots occurred. They have been controversially interpreted, mostly by the foreign press, as an illustration of the difficulty of integrating Muslims in France, and smaller scale riots have been occurring throughout the 1980s and 1990s, first in Vaulx-en-Velin in 1979, and in V√©nissieux in 1981, 1983, 1990 and 1999. According to The Guardian, eight attacks occurred in France during the eighteen months from January 2015 to July 2016, including the January 2015 √éle-de-France attacks (which killed 17 people), the November 2015 Paris attacks (which killed 130), and the July 2016 Nice truck attack (which killed 86). Reportedly, ISIL has called on its supporters for a coordinated wave of attacks in European countries. Timeline 2014 2015 On 26 June 2015, an attacker decapitated one person. He then blew up a gas canister in a factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon, injuring two. On 21 August 2015, in the 2015 Thalys train attack, a man threatened passengers with an AKM assault rifle on a Thalys train between Amsterdam and Paris. One passenger was shot in the neck with a pistol when the rifle jammed. Two United States military personnel and other passengers intervened and overcame the attacker. One of them was cut in the struggle. From 13 November 2015 to 14 November 2015, a series of coordinated attacks began over about 35 minutes at six locations in central Paris. The first shooting attack occurred in a restaurant and a bar in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. There was shooting and a bomb detonated at Bataclan theatre in the 11th arrondissement during a rock concert. Approximately 100 hostages were then taken and overall 89 were killed there. Other bombings took place outside the Stade de France stadium in the suburb of Saint-Denis during a football match between France and Germany. Three days later, in Saint-Denis, a police raid-turned-shootout between at least 100 French police officers and soldiers and suspected members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant occurred, killing three suspects and injuring five police officers. 2016 On 1 January 2016, a 29-year-old Frenchman of Tunisian descent rammed over a civilian and a guard in an entrance of a mosque in Valence, Dr√¥me, reportedly while chanting, \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" He then put his car into reverse to try to ram the soldiers again who fired warning shots and then fired to disable the driver. The driver said he wanted to kill troops because \\"troops killed people\\" and that he wanted to be killed by the troops. On 7 January 2016, an asylum seeker shouted \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" outside a police station in Goutte d'Or, near Montmartre, where police shot and killed him while a passerby was shot. Reports say he was wielding a knife and fake suicide vest. On 11 January 2016, a 15-year-old Turkish boy attacked a teacher from a Jewish school in Marseilles with a machete, apparently attempting to decapitate him. The student told police that he had committed the act \\"in the name of Allah and ISIS\\". On 27 May 2016, a French military person was left in a \\"serious condition\\" after being attacked with knives in Saint-Julien-du-Puy (Tarn). The military was approached by two men who \\"have criticized the French bombing in Syria.\\" He was then beaten with fists and beaten cutter. On 13 June 2016, in the 2016 Magnanville stabbing, a police officer and his wife, a police secretary, were stabbed to death in their home in Magnanville, France, located about west of Paris, by a man convicted in 2013 of associating with a group planning terrorist acts. Amaq News Agency, an online outlet said to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),\\"Amaq ‚Äì 24/7 News Agency Run by ISIS\\", 'from Asharq al- Awsat said that a source had claimed that ISIL was behind the attack. On the evening of 14 July 2016, a 19 tonne cargo truck was deliberately driven into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, resulting in the deaths of 86 people and the injuries of 434 others. On 16 July, two agencies linked to Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. On 26 July 2016, in the 2016 Normandy church attack, two assailants killed the priest Jacques Hamel and seriously wounded a woman in a church in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray. The two assailants were killed by French Special Forces. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. 2017 On 3 February 2017, in the 2017 Louvre machete attack, an Egyptian national in France on a tourist visa was shot as he rushed a group of French soldiers guarding a principal entrance to the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, attacking and injuring one soldier with a machete. The soldiers were patrolling the Museum as part of Op√©ration Sentinelle, guarding the Carrousel du Louvre. Immediately after his arrest, the suspect told authorities that he was carrying spray paint in order to deface the museum's artwork, an act that he regarded as a \\"symbolic\\" attack on France. On 18 March 2017, in the March 2017 √éle-de-France attacks, a pair of terrorist attacks by the same individual occurred in Garges-l√®s-Gonesse, an outer suburb of Paris, and Orly Airport near Paris. The attacker, a 39-year-old man identified as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, was shot dead after attempting to seize a weapon from a soldier patrolling the airport under Op√©ration Sentinelle. On 20 April 2017, in the 2017 shooting of Paris police officers, three police officers were shot by an attacker wielding an AK-47 rifle on the Champs-√âlys√©es, a shopping boulevard in Paris, France. One officer was killed and two others, along with a female tourist, were seriously wounded. The attacker was then shot dead by police. ISIL claimed responsibility. On 6 June 2017, in the 2017 Notre Dame attack, a lone attacker assaulted a police officer at Notre-Dame de Paris. The officer and the attacker, a 40-year-old Algerian graduate student who had left a video, pledging allegiance to ISIL, were both injured. 2018 On 23 March 2018, the Carcassonne and Tr√®bes attack was conducted by a lone attacker who pledged allegiance to ISIL. 4 persons and the attacker were killed and 25 injured. On 11 December 2018, in the 2018 Strasbourg attack, a 29-year-old French citizen of Algerian origin killed five civilians and wounded 11 others at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, before being killed in a shootout with police two days later. 2019 On 24 May 2019, in the 2019 Lyon bomb attack A packet bomb explodes in front of a bakery in the pedestrian zone of Lyon. 13 people were wounded. A 24-year old male student from Algeria was arrested 3 days later. No group has claimed responsibility of the attack yet. On 3 October 2019, in the Paris police headquarters stabbing A radicalized Islamist stabbed four people to death, and injured two others at the central police headquarters in Paris. He was an administrative worker and had been recently converting to Salafist Islam. The perpetrator was shot instantly dead by other officers. 2020 On 4 April 2020 in the 2020 Romans-sur-Is√®re knife attack two people were killed and five others wounded in a mass stabbing in Romans- sur-Is√®re, Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France. The suspect is a 30-year-old Sudanese asylum seeker who was arrested at the scene. French police have launched a terrorism investigation. Two other people related to the attacker were arrested later. On 27 April 2020 Two police officers were seriously injured when a driver rammed his vehicle into them in Colombes, Hauts-de-Seine. The perpetrator was arrested, and a source stated that the man carried out the attack to \\"avenge events in Palestine\\". The attacker had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.  Economic impact   Negative impacts  At the end of 2015, the INSEE forecasts that the terrorist attacks of November will cause a 0.1% decrease of the country's GDP for the last part of that year. Following the hostage taking of the 13th of November 2015 and the July 2016 Nice attack, the French Government decided to raise the tax on insurance contracts from ‚Ç¨3.30 to ‚Ç¨5.90 per contract generating a benefit of ‚Ç¨140 million euros which were redistributed to the victims and their families. Tourism was largely impacted by the terrorist attacks of 2015. Following the week of the 13th, restaurants (especially gourmet ones), movie theatres, museums (Louvre, Grand Palais, ...) and fashion galleries (Lafayette, Printemps Haussman) experienced a downfall of visitor rate up to 50%. This phenomenon was all more so disastrous for the economy as it occurred a couple weeks before Christmas. In 2016, the number of tourists saw a 7% decrease. The SNCF (French National Railroad Service) announced a loss of 300 million euros on that year. The final results of the Regional Comity of Tourism confirmed a fall of 1.5 million tourists, essentially international ones notably Chinese, which represents a loss of 1.3 billion euros.  Positive impacts  Following the attacks, security services are increasingly sought. Private bodyguards are hired, policemen are mobilized to proceed to check ups at the entrance of highly attended public events, hackers are hired to prevent the risk of new attacks. Thousands of French flags were purchased at the end of the year 2016. The book ‚ÄòA Moveable Feast‚Äô, written by Ernest Hemingway, describing the delightful Parisian life in the 1920s, sold 125,400 copies instead of the expected 3000. Book stores quickly experienced a shortage thus thousands of copies were printed to respond to the unprecedented demand.

He credits his parents with fostering his creative personality as a child. Growing up as one of three children, Oriolo and his siblings drew pictures and played various musical instruments. Don's main instruments were the guitar and the piano.wsRadio Interview with Don Oriolo. In one interview, he remembers being six years old and sitting underneath his mother's ironing board while she ironed and listened to Frank Sinatra. He credits this memory of Sinatra's music as his first mind, body, and soul connection to music, even recalling every little detail of the memory, right down to the smell of the fresh laundry, the steam from the iron, and the rhythm of the spray bottle. In a 2015 interview with wsRadio, he recalls his first gig as a musician at a local VFW Hall in New Jersey at the age of 13, but goes on to say that he always thought of his time playing guitar during his mother's sewing circle meetings at the age of nine as the true first live performances of his musical career. Oriolo was also a huge fan of Elvis at this time, another artist he credits for his lifelong love of music. In addition to playing music as a child, Oriolo was also an avid artist, and had a strong connection with the cartoon characters his father co-created. His infatuation with Felix the Cat started at a young age, and this did not escape his father's notice. Joe Oriolo encouraged Don's artistic and musical talents throughout his childhood and into his adult life, and eventually introduced the younger Oriolo to Winston Sharples, Joe's colleague in the animation world.

Music publishing Don began his career in the music industry as a songwriter, session/studio musician, and music arranger, before stepping into what he calls the \\"executive turntable\\" of music publishing. When he was first starting out as an aspiring musician, Oriolo would cut high school and ride a bus from New Jersey into New York City, with his guitar. On these trips into New York, he would go to record and publishing companies to try to get meetings with any executives who would give him five minutes of their time. Eventually he started to turn heads and began to sell songs and work as a studio musician and music arranger. During his time as a studio musician, arranger, and composer, he worked with bands and musicians such as The Chimes, The Tokens, The Paragons, The Cupids, Doctor Hook, Gloria Gaynor, and many more. Having already been in the recording business as a studio musician and writer, he was able to float his interest in professional management to some of the most successful record and publishing executives of the time, eventually landing a job with the Robert Stigwood -owned record company, RSO Records. Oriolo went on to have a successful career in the music publishing business, discovering and signing musicians such as Meat Loaf, Jim Steinman, and Lisa Lisa. He also wrote music and arranged and produced records for musicians such as Lisa Lisa & the Cult Jam, Doctor Hook, Meco, Robert Gordon and many more.All Music Don Oriolo Credits.

His siblings were David and Beatrice. The Coventrys were an established and wealthy New England grazing family. Their ancestors arrived in Australia from Scotland in 1836 and settled in the New England district in 1839. Generations and branches of the family had taken up several properties in the district, including 'Rockvale Station' with its old homestead where Chandler, along with his brother and sisters, spent much of his time as a child. Coventry was educated as a boarder at The Armidale School and at Barker College, Sydney. In school breaks and holidays he took his part in farm work on the family property. Career Grazier Following his schooling, Chandler returned to farming on family properties. When he was just twenty he inherited a pastoral run, 'Tulloch', and money from his uncle David. Returning from a grand tour in England and Europe with his sister Beatrice in 1952 he found that his brother David had sold the home property Rockvale Station. Chandler proceeded to sell off some of his own assets to buy it back as sole owner. Through several purchases and bequests he eventually owned more than 15,000 acres of land.Goldsmith, Merle, \\"Chandler Phillip Coventry, AM, (1924-1999) Grazier, Art Adventurer, Benefactor\\", in Ryan, J.

In 1970 Coventry opened his own gallery in his house at 38 Hargrave Street, Paddington, Sydney.Eisenberg, Joseph and New England Regional Art Museum (N.S.W.) A view of the collections. New England Regional Art Museum, Armidale, N.S.W, 1997.p.5 Several Central Street artists followed him. When space at Hargrave Street proved insufficient Coventry in 1974 purchased and renovated the much larger building at 56 Sutherland Street, Paddington and created the second Coventry Gallery which finally closed after his death in 1999. The Coventry Gallery is a landmark in Australian gallery history, energetically showing new and emerging Australian artists as well as staging exhibitions by leading overseas artists such as Bridget Riley and David Hockney. Coventry built his personal collection of art over decades from his youth through his time as a gallery operator. At the peak of his collecting, from the 1960s to the 1980s, he favoured current art - freshly made, and by artists who were not yet established. Whilst he did not pursue fashions or a particular school of art, he acquired innovative and challenging works, in the Central Street and early Coventry Gallery years notably abstract, colourfield and hard-edge, Quinn, Mary \\"Chandler Coventry, 1924-1999 Collector, Patron and Benefactor\\", in Art Insight no. 50, October 1999 p.4 then after 1972 his taste embraced painterliness, lyrical abstraction, even gesture and figuration.Goldsmith, Merle, \\"Chandler Phillip Coventry, AM, (1924-1999) Grazier, Art Adventurer, Benefactor\\", in Ryan, J.

Chandler invited many of these visiting international artists to use his property Rockvale Station as a base, giving them an opportunity to experience the Australian bush. In 1966 Coventry made his first donation of more than fifty works to the Armidale City Gallery,Goldsmith, Merle, \\"Chandler Phillip Coventry, AM, (1924-1999) Grazier, Art Adventurer, Benefactor\\", in Ryan, J.

In 1979, he gave a large portion of his private collection to Armidale on the understanding that an art museum would be built to house both his collection and the Howard Hinton collection then housed in the Armidale Teacher's College.Australia Council; Arts NSW; Museums and Galleries NSW (2007), Beyond Region : public galleries in New South Wales, Arts NSW and Australia Council for the Arts, p.144 Reflecting contemporary art movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Coventry's collection would complement Hinton's strength in Australian art of the first half of the twentieth century. Coventry's offer was the catalyst for a regional fundraising campaign to establish the museum that was to become the New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM). Coventry was himself an active driving force in the establishment of the NERAM, not only through the donation of the bulk of his collection of contemporary art, but also through his profile in the art world and his extensive connections in farming and grazing communities. One fundraising venture was a selling exhibition at the Coventry Gallery in 1980 of works donated to the NERAM appeal. He became a founding trustee and patron of NERAM. Selections from the Coventry collection are regularly on exhibit at NERAM. Besides his contributions to the New England Regional Art Museum, Coventry donated works to the National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Queensland Art Gallery, National Gallery of Victoria, Power Gallery of Contemporary Art at the University of Sydney, Penrith Regional Gallery & The Lewers Bequest, Campbelltown Art Gallery and the Wollongong Art Gallery. The Chandler Coventry Collection at NERAM The Chandler Coventry Collection at the New England Regional Art Museum reflects art movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Australian artists represented include Ralph Balson, Peter Booth, Gunter Christmann, Janet Dawson, Elaine Haxton, Leah MacKinnon, Michael Taylor, Dick Watkins and Brett Whiteley. Notable international artists include Christo and Jeanne-Claude and Charlotte Moorman. Later life The stress of running a gallery in Sydney and a fine wool property six hundred kilometers north, while advocating and fundraising for an art museum in Armidale, brought Coventry to the decision in 1979 to sell Rockvale Station. In 1980 Coventry suffered two strokes that paralysed the left side of his body and necessitated he use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He maintained his interest in contemporary Australian art but it was three years before he was able to get his gallery going again with the help of his long-term partner Phillip Shepherd.Goldsmith, Merle, \\"Chandler Phillip Coventry, AM, (1924-1999) Grazier, Art Adventurer, Benefactor\\", in Ryan, J. S. (John Sprott) & Cady, Bruce & University of New England & Armidale and District Historical Society (2001). New England lives II. University of New England in association with the Armidale and District Historical Society, Armidale, N.S.W. pp149 A wave of new names exhibited in the gallery in the 1980s including David Larwill, Christopher Hodges, Aida Tomescu, and Nigel Thomson. He showed Melbourne's Roar Studio artists to Sydney in 1985. In the 1990s the gallery exhibited further new artists including Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Bronwyn Bancroft, and David Bromley. Rather than succoring a stable of artists as other galleries do, Coventry continually found new talents and new directions. He jealously guarded his role of selecting artworks, maintaining the relationships with artists, and setting the ambience of the gallery. Coventry was devastated by his disability in the years following his stroke. Nigel Thomson's 1983 Archibald-Prize winning portrait of Chandler reveals a bitter and crestfallen man in a wheel-chair alone in the empty Coventry Gallery. Channy commented \\"... it says what I feel ... It is what I am\\".The Weekend Australian 17-18 December, 1983, p.3. After his stroke he was at times gloomy and irascible, uncareful to contain his feelings and opinions. Angus Nivison described him as \\"definitely a difficult pleasure: yet he was always generous and thoughtful\\"Eulogy for Chandler P. Coventry, AM, 17 September 1999, St. Stephen's Uniting Church, Sydney. Following the incorporation of the Chandler Coventry Collection into the New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) Channy kept a close and critical eye on the activities of NERAM. He disliked the fact that the bulk of both Hinton and Coventry collections were kept in storage rather than on display. He vehemently disapproved of NERAM's sale of two non- Australian works from the Hinton Collection, obviously concerned that a similar fate may befall works from his own donation after his demise. He objected to the commercialism of NERAM's annual fund-raising Packsaddle exhibition. Chandler Coventry died on 14 September 1999 in his downstairs apartment at the Coventry Gallery. His funeral service was held at St. Stephen's Church on Macquarie Street, Sydney. Coventry Gallery closed on 4 December 1999.

While being treated he noticed some old manuscripts that Bhagwan Lal was studying as an archaeologist and he became very interested in the field and expressed his wish to learn more.Shah (1999):16-19. When Bhagwan Lal accompanied James Burgess to Nasik for some studies of inscriptions, Jayakrisha accompanied them. This association which lasted for nearly a decade extended from an interest in archaeology to herbal medicines, and plants. He began to study Hooker's First Book of Botany and learned to prepare herbarium specimens. Bhagwan Lal then suggested that Indraji meet Dr Sakharam Arjun, botany professor at Grant Medical College. He began to identify plants and learn botany from Sakharam Arjun and preparing herbarium specimens of plants from around Bombay. He gradually became acquainted with many other naturalists including Herbert Mills Birdwood, Chester MacNaghten, Principal of the Rajkumar College at Rajkot, James Macnabb Campbell and Dr D. MacDonald who succeeded Dr Sakharam Arjun at the Grant Medical College. After the death of Dr Arjun, Indraji was in contact with his adopted daughter Rukhmabai who introduced indraji to the botanist Dr J.C. Lisboa.Shah (1999):18. When MacNaghten went on holidays he sought the ethno-botanical assistance of Indraji and along with Dr MacDonald, they made visits to Matheran to study the flora. Rustomjee Khory made use of Indraji's assistance paying Rupees 30 a month while producing his Materia Medica but did not acknowledge his help.  Employment in Porbander  leftHerbert Mills Birdwood and MacNaghten attempted to help Indraji obtain a suitable employment but Indraji would not accept working with anyone but Bhagwan Lal. Through MacNaghten, the Maharaja of Porbander offered assistance for Indraji to study the flora of the Barda mountain. Frederick Styles Philpin Lely, the British administrator for Porbander also supported the project and Indraji was appointed as Curator of Forests and Gardens of the state of Porbander on 1 October 1886. Initially Indraji declined the offer as the salary was Rupees 100 a month but on the influence of MacNaghten and Lely this was increased to 200 and he took the offer. Jayakrishna worked with the local shepherd community, the Rabaris, to collect ethnobotanical information. One of his studies was on the lethal effects of Indigofera cordifolia on sheep that grazed them shortly after the rains. He worked for 19 years in the region and produced his magnum opus, on the Flora of Barda Mountain only in 1910. Although he was persuaded to write it in English, he chose to write it in Gujarati and titled it \\"Vanaspati ≈öƒÅstra, A Complete and Comprehensive Account of the Flora of Barda Mountain\\". He wrote: \\"Europeans placed in their countries know and write about the plants of this country, and my countrymen would not know about the plants in their courtyard and those trampled under their feet. I will write the book in my mother tongue\\". When the manuscript of the book was ready, the Maharaja of Porbander had died and there was no monetary support for it. Finding a publisher was difficult. He once met Lalshankar Umashankar on a train and the latter offered to print the book through the Gujarat Vernacular Society on the condition that he removed the dedication page to the King of Porbander State. Indraji refused to accept the condition. He finally printed it at his own cost, pawning some of his wife's jewellery, and only a 1000 copies were printed with many left unsold that forced him to halve the price. He retired and moved to Kutch where the Maharaja of Kutch took an interest and made him Superintendent of the Palace and made him in-charge of reforestation and planting. He promoted the use of tree planting to block the expansion of dunes and wrote a book Plants of Kutch and Their Utility (1926) which included 99 line drawings.  Personal life  Indraji married at the age of about 38 shortly after obtaining employment in Porbander State. Bhagwanlal gifted him Rs 200 to cover his wedding expenses. Dr Sakharam Arjun also made a similar contribution.Shah (1999):18. The couple had two sons who died young but a daughter Sundarben survived and also took an interest in plants.Shah (1999):37.  Death and after  Jayakrishna died at Bhuj on 3 December 1929, Mahatma Gandhi wrote an obituary commenting that \\"...He had a vast collection of plants ... such men with unflinching devotion to their interest are rare. Let all of us emulate his single mindedness and self confidence.\\" Indraji's herbarium collection is partly preserved at the College of Agriculture, Pune. Indraji passed on his collections of books to Ayurveda scholar Bapalal Garbaddas Shah who wrote a biography of Indraji in Gujarati in 1931.Shah (1999):xii. This book was translated into English by Professor J.J. Shah in 1999.

Vizard. It aims to be inclusive, promoting and nurturing an interest in all branches of science, while catering for wide levels of knowledge, from layman to expert alike. The society maintains specialist astronomy and meteorology sections and runs a programme of lectures on various scientific topics in the Hampstead area of North West London. The HSS is a registered charity which is affiliated with the British Science Association and the Richmond Scientific Society. History In 1898 the author of A Guide to Hampstead, P.E.Vizard, learned that a Hampstead resident, Colonel Henry Heberden JP, had a 10.5-inch Newtonian reflecting telescope that he wanted to donate to a Society in order for it to be made available to members of the public. Thus in July 1899, at a public meeting, the Hampstead Astronomical and General Scientific Society was formed. In 1902 the respected physician, pathologist and biographer Sir Samuel Wilks became the society's president. Following Wilks' retirement, in 1910 Patrick Hepburn of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) joined the society, becoming its joint secretary with Vizard. In 1923 a 6-inch Cooke refracting telescope was presented to the Society by George Avenell and remains the primary telescope in use at the Hampstead Observatory. Patrick Hepburn 1915 (HSS Secretary of Astronomy) Hampstead Observatory History The Observatory's first telescope was a 10.5\\" Newtonian donated by Henry Heberden, whose act of philanthropy resulted in the founding of the HSS. Patrick Hepburn of the BAA joined the society in 1910, subsequently becoming the Director of the Saturn section of the BAA. In 1923 a 6-inch Cooke refracting telescope was lent to the Society by George Avenell, it was formally gifted to the society in 1928 and is still the main telescope in use at the observatory today. The date of manufacture of the telescope is unknown, however, it matches the appearance and specification of a \\"missing\\" telescope commissioned by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich for the 1874 Transit of Venus Expedition to Hawaii. Renowned optical instrument maker, and one time JAS president, Henry Wildey was Astronomical Secretary of the HSS from 1946‚Äì1988. He was responsible for organising the public open nights and maintaining the instruments and building. In 1967 H.N (Ron) Irving was commissioned to overhaul the telescope's mounting, drive and clock, a job he carried out at a highly subsidised rate and was granted honorary life membership as a result of his generosity. In 1971 Herbert Stark, who was HSS general secretary from 1966 to 1974, set-up a sub-committee, headed by Doug Daniels, to focus on the observatory's repair and maintenance. Civil Engineer Keith Hitchcock was appointed to look after the observatory building's renovation. In order to raise capital for the renovations some of the society's equipment was sold, including a vintage sidereal clock, which was a valuable antique. In addition to the renovation of the observatory's buildings, the Cooke telescope's mount was rebuilt by Terry Pearce, who, due to the observatories financial constraints, convivially accepted payment through instalments spread over a three-year period. Recent photo of the Hampstead Observatory Doug Daniels succeeded Henry Wildey as Astronomical secretary in 1988, following Wildey's retirement. Doug Daniels remained the president of the HSS for 30 years. However, in 2018, he too announced his retirement and was succeeded by Simon Lang. The Observatory today The observatory is open to the public during the winter months, when the sky is more likely to be clear. The open hours are generally between 8.00pm ‚Äì 10.00pm from mid September to mid April on Friday and Saturday evenings and additionally between 11am ‚Äì 1.00pm on Sunday mornings. Volunteers from HSS/CATS are on hand to assist visitors. Amateur Telescope Makers of London Sir Samuel Wilks 1907 The Amateur Telescope Makers of London (ATMoL), formerly known as the Camden Astronomy and Telescope-making Society (CATS) was founded in 1966 as an evening Astronomy class set up by Doug Daniels (HSS Astronomy secretary from 1988), later evolving to include telescope making under the expert tutelage of Terry Pearce. After the closure of the original venue at Acland Burghley School in Tufnell Park, the class moved to Westminster Kingsway College, Regent's Park and continued for many years at this location until government cuts led to the class being cancelled in 2005. This precipitated the formation of ATMoL/CATS as it is today, a non-profit subscription per term funded class, still under the tutelage and mentorship of Terry Pearce and continues its affiliation with the Astronomy section of the HSS. From 2016 the Camden Astronomy & Telescope- making Society's home has been the Holly Lodge Community Centre in Highgate and classes are fortnightly on Wednesday evenings. Events In addition to the society's AGMs and functions, it also has a monthly lecture programme. The lectures cover a broad range of scientific areas and, like the observatory, are open to the public. The lectures are held at the Crypt Room of St.John's Church in Hampstead, NW3 6UU.

The magazine was founded by Stuart Coupe and Donald Robertson and forty-eight issues were published between March 1978 and January 1983. The magazine was inspired by the punk rock/new wave movement of the mid 1970s and took its name from the Jonathan Richman song Roadrunner. In its first year (1978) Roadrunner was produced by an editorial collective that included Coupe, Robertson, Allan Coop, Alex Ehlert, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker and was only distributed in South Australia. Robertson became editor and publisher and secured national distribution from issue 10 (February 1979). Issue 23 (February 1980) of the magazine forms part of the Festival Records collection at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum as an example of how rock music magazines helped to promote overseas recording artists. In the first edition of the Australian Music Directory (1981‚Äì82), Miranda Brown commented that Roadrunner offered its readers, ‚Äòthe vitality that established papers often lack.‚Äô She went on to say: 'The paper has a strong nationalistic bent and though its coverage of the English scene is extensive, most of the copy is written by Australians abroad or here. Roadrunner articles tend to be rough-edged and experimental, with a minimum of editorial intervention. The approach is personal and highly committed and the magazine was the first to treat Australian music as a force with its own history, geography and ideologies, although the other major rock papers quickly followed suit.‚Äô In Dig‚ÄîAustralian Rock and Pop Music 1960‚Äì85 David Nichols says: ‚ÄòAdelaide‚Äôs Roadrunner was without doubt a quality publication. Edited and published by Donald Robertson‚Äîthe survivor from its founding co-operative‚Äîthe paper attracted a number of important and interesting writers from around the country who recognised it as a valuable forum. Roadrunner, whose cover price was similar to the imported magazines such as NME and Melody Maker, exhibited considerable bravery. It had no qualms about running a five-page exploration of (Mushroom Records‚Äô) Michael Gudinski‚Äôs business interests. It also gave invaluable early coverage to new Aboriginal groups such as No Fixed Address, even before they made the classic film Wrong Side of the Road ‚Äì indeed it put them on its cover. That all this was achieved from Australia's smallest mainland state capital is testament to the talent and dedication of Robertson and his writers.‚Äô The magazine hit financial difficulties in mid-1982 and relocated to Sydney for a final issue, which was published in January 1983. The final issue saw a change to a full colour, glossy format that anticipated the emergence of Countdown Magazine (1982‚Äì87) and the Australian version of Smash Hits. Notable contributors included: Keith Shadwick, Stuart Matchett, Ross Stapleton, Scott Matheson, Peter Nelson, Adrian Ryan, Keri Phillips, Craig N. Pearce, Larry Buttrose, Chris Willis, Toby Creswell, Mark Mordue, Richard McGregor, Richard Guilliat, David Langsam, Jillian Burt, Dennis Atkins and Elly McDonald. In May 2017, the University of Wollongong in New South Wales made all 48 issues of Roadrunner available in a digital archive. To accompany this release, publisher Donald Robertson published a brief history of the magazine. In October 2019, Roadrunnertwice published The Big Beat: rock music in Australia 1978-1983, through the pages of Roadrunner magazine, a 544 page anthology of the magazine in a limited hardcover edition of 500 copies.

It was made available exclusively through the Amazon Video streaming service, first on 17 November 2016 at 23:00 GMT. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, who previously presented as a trio on BBC Two motoring programme Top Gear, present the show. Production of the episode was handled by W. Chump and Sons, with executive production done by Andy Wilman, who previously served as the executive producer of Top Gear. Prior to filming, Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC after he was involved in an altercation with a Top Gear producer in March 2015, leaving Hammond, May, and Wilman to follow him in departing the show following the end of the series. Later in 2015, they signed a deal with Amazon to create an original series. Filming for the introduction and tent scenes took place in Los Angeles, California in September 2016. The episode features the trio introducing the new bits of the show, as well as their film. For the film, the trio traveled in three supercars to the Algarve International Circuit in Portugal, where they had timed laps performed by race car driver J√©r√¥me d'Ambrosio. The episode received very positive reviews from critics upon its release. Critics noted similarities between the episode and Top Gear in their reviews. It attracted nearly two million viewers in its first weekend of release and was eventually made available to non-Amazon Prime members for free viewing from 23 to 26 December 2016. Summary Clarkson, Hammond and May launch their new series with a film showing Clarkson leaving London to fly to Los Angeles where he meets Hammond and May. Irish rock band Hothouse Flowers plays \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" as the trio drive modified Ford Mustangs through the California desert to Rabbit Dry Lake, while being accompanied by a range of cars and a fly-over by the Breitling Jet Team. The trio greet the audience and viewers and also introduce the show's tent. The film presented in the episode shows Clarkson, Hammond and May testing three hybrid hypercars; the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 and Ferrari LaFerrari at the Algarve International Circuit in Portugal. After the first portion of the film, Clarkson, back at the tent, introduces the \\"Conversation Street\\" segment, where the trio talk about a speeding ticket that May received for driving a mere . Then the show's new test track, the \\"Eboladrome\\" at RAF Wroughton, is revealed, where after a Ferrari 488 is driven, Clarkson test drives a BMW M2, which is then taken around the \\"Eboladrome\\" by their new driver, former NASCAR champion Mike Skinner. Afterward, the \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\" segment is introduced, featuring celebrities who are scheduled to appear on the show, but are all humorously \\"killed\\" before being able to take part. Jeremy Renner, Armie Hammer and Carol Vorderman all appear individually during this segment. Returning to Portugal, Belgian race car driver J√©r√¥me d'Ambrosio performs timed laps in the hypercars. Clarkson makes a bet with Hammond and May that they will be able to demolish his house, if the McLaren P1 is not the fastest in a timed lap. The episode ends with the lap times being revealed back in the tent, showing that the P1 did not have the fastest lap. Clarkson's house would later be destroyed in \\"Opera, Arts and Donuts\\", the third episode of the first season. Filming and production Prior to the filming of The Grand Tour, Clarkson, Hammond, and May presented BBC Two motoring programme Top Gear, with Wilman handling the executive production. In March 2015, it was reported that Clarkson had come under fire by the BBC for entering an altercation with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon while filming for the show. The BBC chose not to renew Clarkson's contract after news of the altercation came to light. Hammond, May, and Wilman also left the programme afterward. Later in the year, the four signed a deal with Amazon to have an Amazon Video original series. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had described the deal as \\"very, very, very expensive\\" during an interview with The Daily Telegraph. After the deal was made, the four also created their own production company, named W. Chump and Sons. \\"The Holy Trinity\\" marks Jeremy Clarkson's return to presenting since his departure from the BBC. Filming for the arrival in California and the studio recordings took place on 25 September 2016. Amazon had enabled a sweepstakes in July for customers to enter in order to get tickets for the tent recording of the episode. Though acting as the show's first episode to be aired, it was the second episode to have its studio recordings filmed; studio recordings for \\"Operation Desert Stumble\\", the second episode, were filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa earlier on 25 July. In October, it was revealed that the opening scene for the episode cost ¬£2.5 million (equivalent to $3.2 million) to make, making it the most expensive scene made in television history. Production of the episode was handled by Clarkson, Hammond, May, and Wilman's independent production company W. Chump & Sons. Similar to Top Gear, Wilman served as the executive producer. The episode is presented, at maximum, in 4K Ultra HD, running at 23.98 frames per second with HDR. Release and reception The Grand Tour is an Amazon Video original series and is exclusive to Amazon Prime members. It was scheduled for an 18 November 2016 release at 00:01 GMT, but was released an hour earlier on 17 November at 23:00 GMT instead. The opening weekend for the episode attracted about 1,954,000 viewers in the 18‚Äì49 age range, tripling that of The Man in the High Castle, another show on Amazon Video. Non-Prime members were able to watch the episode for free from 23 to 26 December. \\"The Holy Trinity\\" received very positive reviews from critics upon its release. Comparisons were often drawn to Top Gear by critics. Luke Reilly of IGN awarded the episode a score of 8.0/10, stating that the show had gotten off to a \\"confident start\\" with the episode and that it \\"doesn't reinvent the Top Gear formula, but rather refines it.\\" Neela Debnath of Daily Express complimented the episode's similarities with Top Gear, feeling as though it was \\"basically like Top Gear on steroids.\\" Jack Shepherd of The Independent had a similar feeling about the episode, labeling it as \\"the best of Top Gear but with a much bigger budget\\" in his review headline. For The Guardian, Sam Wollaston wrote that the trio \\"leave the BBC in their dust\\" and that they are sure to please fans of Top Gear due to the similarities between the two.

It premiered on Rooster Teeth's website on November 4, 2014, with a total of 8 episodes.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4176650/fullcredits Each episode is uploaded to Rooster Teeth's YouTube channel a day after its release on the Rooster Teeth website. The show featured an interactive murder mystery component and is inspired by Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. A semi-sequel series, The Eleven Little Roosters, debuted on January 16, 2017. Format Creator Josh Flanagan described the series as a \\"proof of concept\\" for different, interactive experiences that can be offered by a web series. The series is inspired by Agatha Christie's 1939 novel And Then There Were None. Viewers vote on who they think the murderer is, who they think will die, and how that person will meet their end. Correct guesses were entered for a chance to win Rooster Teeth merchandise, and the fan with the most correct answers upon the completion of the show will win a trip to the Rooster Teeth studios or to a convention of his or her choice. One party guest is murdered each episode. Both the novel and the series involve the party of ten people being murdered one by one by a mysterious killer, their deaths foreshadowed in the form of a poem. However, the show has a much more comedic tone than the novel. Much of the humour is derived from knowledge of Rooster Teeth itself. For example, characters wear wardrobe from their previous productions (Demarais dons his hobbit costume from A Simple Walk Into Mordor while Haywood wears a kilt akin to his Minecraft avatar). In addition, the story is different so that people familiar with the source material are unable to guess the outcome.https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rooster-teeth-ten-little- roosters-murder-mystery/ The victim dies within the last few minutes of the episode, their death often being the last few shots. The episode ends with a portrait of the murder victim hanging on a wall and a plaque below the portrait with the specific verse of the poem foreshadowing that character's death. Plot The series opens at Rooster Teeth's first company banquet hosted by Burnie Burns for nine of his employees: Chris Demarais, Barbara Dunkelman, Adam Ellis, Gavin Free, Ryan Haywood, Lindsay Jones, Michael Jones, Miles Luna and Gus Sorola. The guests stumble upon a poem entitled Ten Little Roosters, written in the style of the original Ten Little Indians poem. As the evening goes on it becomes clear that the verses of the poem are outlining the murders of several guests over the course of the night, and the guests have no choice but to try and survive locked in with a cold-blooded murderer.

Biography Johnson lived in Clarksdale, Mississippi and is believed to have been from Robinsonville. According to pianist John \\"Red\\" Williams, who remembered her in Tunica in the late 1920s, \\"she was a small woman, about 20 years old, playing piano in a joint attached to the cotton mill quarters\\". By 1930, she was living and performing on a plantation in Claxton. On May 28, 1930, after traveling to Grafton, Wisconsin, she partook in a recording session arranged by record producer Art Laibly for Paramount Records with Son House, Willie Brown, and her romantic partner Charley Patton. At the session, Johnson recorded four sides, including an unreleased alternate take. Cripple Clarence Lofton claimed he accompanied her on piano for her songs, but House disagreed, insisting Johnson herself provided the instrumentals. Blues writer Steve Cheseborough in his book Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues commented on the rarity: \\"This concept was so unfamiliar to scholars and fans that for years they tried to determine which male pianist had backed Johnson on her records\\". Despite her small stature, Johnson sang in a lusty voice and some of her material was of the dirty blues variety. Her best-known song is \\"On the Wall\\", a sexually explicit tune showcasing Johnson's piano arrangement loosely based on \\"Cow Cow Blues\\". Returning to Mississippi, Johnson was also a part of a \\"love triangle\\" with Patton and House, apparently wooing House on the trip home. Patton referred to the turn of events in his song, \\"Joe Kirby Blues\\". Around 1940, she was allegedly living in Memphis, but not much is known about Johnson's life after the recording session.

It is a rare ground orchid with a single, sparsely hairy leaf and a single dark red to crimson flower with blackish tips. Description Caladenia cruciformis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a marble-sized, underground tuber. In late autumn, a single, sparsely hairy leaf long and wide with a reddish tinge at its base emerges. A single dark red to crimson, occasionally pink flower, with darker red stripes is borne on a thin, hairy, dark green to purple spike tall. The flowers have a fragrance resembling a hot motor. The petals and lateral sepals are long and spread widely, giving rise to the common name. The dorsal sepal is erect, wide at the base and tapers to a thread-like end with a club-like tip a further long and covered with dark red glands. The lateral sepals are about wide at the base then narrow to a thread like end with a club-like tip similar to but shorter than that on the dorsal sepal. The petals are shorter than the sepals and lack the blackish tips. The labellum is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide and curves downward at the tip. It is dark red with a whitish base and the sides of the labellum turn upwards. There is a fringe of linear teeth about long on the sides but which decrease in size towards the front. There are four to six rows of linear foot-shaped calli along the centre of the labellum, decreasing in size towards the front. Flowering occurs between September and October and is followed by a capsule which releases thousands of black seeds a few weeks later. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cruciformis was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1999 from a specimen collected near Stuart Mill and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (cruciformis) is derived from the Latin word crux meaning \\"cross\\" and the suffix -formis meaning \\"shaped\\". Distribution and habitat The red cross spider orchid is found in eucalypt forest or woodland with a heathy understorey, growing in sandy loam with accumulated leaf litter. It is only known from a small area near Stuart Mill and the Dalyenong Nature Conservation Reserve. Conservation Caladenia cruciformis is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. A successful program of propagation and reintroduction of the species has been undertaken and a second generation of reintroduced plants have set seed in four separate sites. The main threats to the species include unauthorised firewood collection, grazing by native and introduced animals, weed invasion, inappropriate burning and illegal collection.

Design  CLS4 Carpentaria is one of four identical lightships designed in 1915 by the Scottish firm D & C Stevenson of Edinburgh and built in 1916-17 at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, Australia; they were designated CLS1 to CLS4. The design is optimised for operating unmanned anchored at a stationary position on station offshore for prolonged periods of time, away from port. Carpentaria has a riveted steel hull and no superstructure, with a single mast amidships mounting the beacon lantern atop. Being a stationary vessel, she has no installed propulsion engines her and has to be towed to change position or return to port. In 1950, CLS4 was equipped with a diesel engine to power an anchor windlass; it was protected by a steel deckhouse added at that moment. Carpentarias lantern was powered by acetylene gas, of which she carried a 6-month supply in 4 tanks; the gas flow was controlled by a valve which would regulate the flashes of the light according to the code assigned to the station. The gas would shut down during daylight; the beacon light could be seen from 10 nautical miles away. She also carried a bell activated by the rolling motion, so it could be heard on low visibility conditions.  History  CLS4 Carpentaria was built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard; launched in 1917, she was put in service that year, together with her sister ship CLS2, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. They would alternate between being on station and in port for maintenance. Later in their career, Carpentaria was assigned as traffic separator in the Bass Strait, where they narrowly avoided being hit by container ships. In 1985, both Carpentaria ships were decommissioned; later they were destined for preservation: CLS2 was given to the Queensland Maritime Museum in Brisbane, QLD, while CLS4 went to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney, NSW. As of late 2016, CLS4 Carpentaria is still part of the collection of the ANMM and is on display at the museum‚Äôs wharves in Darling Harbour.

The Sarawakian culture has been influenced by Bruneian Malays of the coastal areas. Substantial cultural influences also came from the Chinese and British cultures. Interracial marriages, formerly rare or between closely related tribes, are increasingly common. Indigenous cultures Iban's are considered proto-Malays, however their culture has been unaffected by Islamic culture. While many communities have converted to Christianity, some continue to follow indigenous beliefs. Customary practices, including jural rules, rituals, and social customs, are collectively known as adat and remain important for Ibans. It differs from the Malay adat in that it is entwined with traditional religious beliefs, and in that some of it can be carried out through law. The Iban longhouse functions as a community, each holding several families (over 50 in some cases) related through blood and marriage. A communal corridor (the ruai) runs through the building, and is the location of communal activities, such as work, socialising, celebrating, and discussing community matters. Each Iban longhouse has a head (tuai rumah), determined by community vote upon the death of their predecessor, who acts as a leader and an arbitrator. The tuai rumah reports to the penghulu, who leads several longhouses. In the modern era, the tuai rumah is also responsible for implementing government policies in these communities. Headhunting was once an important tradition for the Ibans, with Sarawak once nicknamed the \\"Land of the Headhunters\\". It was part of a heroic warrior code where tribal prestige was determined by its capacity for warfare. The custom is no longer observed, after being made illegal shortly after the Second World War. The closely related Lun Bawang and Kelabit tribes have undergone significant cultural change due to conversion to Christianity, affecting their religious and ethnic identities. Each village now has a church, which has taken over the social and community functions previously associated with the longhouse. The Penan people were one of the last remaining indigenous groups. While a minority retain traditional nomadic ways, most have settled down and adopted modern clothing, with less attention paid to traditional hairstyles, dangling earlobe modification, and traditional rattan bangles. Attractions and recreational spots The Sarawak State Museum Sarawak Cultural Village is located at the foot of Mount Santubong, Kuching. Known as the \\"living museum\\", it showcases the various ethnic groups carrying out traditional activities in their respective traditional houses. Cultural performances are presented here. The Sarawak State Museum houses a collection of artefacts such as pottery, textiles, and woodcarving tools from various ethnic tribes in Sarawak, as well as ethnographic materials of local cultures. The museum building preserves its French architecture. Other museums include the Islamic Heritage Museum, Petroleum Museum, Chinese History Museum, Kuching Cat Museum, Textile Museum Sarawak, Art Museum, Lau King Howe Hospital Memorial Museum, and Baram Regional Museum. There is a series of well- preserved forts in Sarawak built during the Brooke regime such as Fort Margherita, Fort Emma, Fort Sylvia, and Fort Alice. The Batang Ai Resort and Bawang Assan Iban longhouses allow the visiting guests to have an overnight stay and to participate in traditional Iban daily activities. Other longhouses include: Iban longhouses in Kapit, Bidayuh longhouses in Kuching, Kelabit longhouses in Bario, Lun Bawang longhouses in Ba'kelalan, and Melanau wooden houses in Sibu. Main Bazaar and Carpenter Street are the two notable streets in Chinatown, Kuching. India Street in Kuching is notable for its textile products. An IndianMuslim mosque can be found in the vicinity.

Well-known handicrafts in Sarawak include Orang Ulu beadwork, Iban Pua Kumbu, Bidayuh Kesah mats and Tambok baskets, Malay Kain Songket, ethnic headgear, and Chinese pottery. Sarawak Artists Society was established in 1985 to promote local cultures and arts in the form of paintings. Most artists in the post-war Sarawak prefers scenery and nature, traditional dances, and traditional daily activities as their drawing themes. Orang Ulu's Sapeh (a dug-out guitar) is the best known traditional musical instrument in Sarawak. It was played for Queen Elizabeth II during her official visit to Sarawak in 1972. Other traditional musical instruments are various types of gongs and Kulintang, idiophones, bamboo flutes and zithers. Ngajat, the Iban warrior dance gazetted as part of Sarawak culture. The oral tradition has been part of the culture of the various indigenous groups in Sarawak for generations. It is used for passing on life lessons, traditions, and values to the younger generation.

Indigenous traditions have become a source of writing inspiration for Sarawak Chinese authors.  Cuisine  A bowl of Sarawak laksa Notable dishes in the state include Sarawak laksa, kolo mee, and ayam pansuh. The state is also known for its Sarawak layer cake dessert. Each ethnic group has its own delicacies with different styles of preparing, cooking, and eating food. However, modern technology has altered the way of cooking for native dishes. Examples of ethnic foods are the Iban tuak (rice wine), Melanau tebaloi (sago palm crackers) and umai (raw fish mixed with lime juice), and Orang Ulu urum giruq (pudding). The traditional food of Sarawak has been marketed as a culinary tourism product. Examples of locally grown franchise stores in Sarawak are Sugar Bun, Singapore Chicken Rice, and Bing Coffee. Other international foods such as Western food, Indonesian food, Indian food, and Middle Eastern food can also be found there.

Holidays and festivals  Sarawakians celebrating festival with a fireworks display. Sarawakians observe a number of holidays and festivals throughout the year. Apart from national Hari Merdeka and Malaysia Day celebrations, the state also celebrates Sarawak Self-government Day on 22 July and the State Governor's birthday. Ethnic groups also celebrate their own festivals. The open house tradition allows other ethnic groups to join in the celebrations. Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia to declare the Gawai Dayak celebration a public holiday. It is also the only state in Malaysia that does not gazette the Deepavali celebration as a public holiday. Religious groups are free to hold processions in major towns and cities during festivals. Sarawak and Sabah are the only two states in Malaysia that declare Good Friday a public holiday. The Kuching Festival is a month-long celebration that is held every August to commemorate its elevation to city status in 1988. Miri City Day is held in conjunction with Miri May Fest every year.  Sports  Sarawak sent its own teams to participate in the 1958 and 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, and 1962 Asian Games before its athletes started representing Malaysia after 1963. The Sarawak State Sports Council was formed in 1985 to raise the standard of sports in Sarawak. Sarawak was the host of the Malaysian SUKMA Games in 1990 and 2016. The state was the overall champion in the 1990, 1992, and 1994 SUKMA games. Sarawakians have represented Malaysia in the Southeast Asian Games. The state also sent athletes to participate in the Special Olympics World Games. Sarawak emerged as the overall champion for 11 consecutive years at the Malaysia Para Games beginning in 1994. There are several stadiums in Sarawak: Sarawak Stadium, Sarawak State Stadium, Stadium Perpaduan (Unity Stadium), and Sarawak State Hockey Stadium. The Sarawak FA football association was founded in 1974. It won the Malaysia FA Cup in 1992 and the Malaysia Premier League in 1997 and 2013.

A replacement for the previous series Ultimate Spider-Man, the first season premiered on August 19, 2017 on Disney XD. The show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 18, 2018. The show was subtitled Spider-Man: Maximum Venom for its third season, which premiered on April 19, 2020. Plot Season 1 Gifted teenager Peter Parker is given super powers when he is bitten by a radioactive spider during a school field trip to Oscorp Industries. After the death of his Uncle Ben by a burglar that he hesitated to stop at a wrestling arena, Peter comes to his own terms of being the superhero Spider-Man. Some time later, Peter begins learning how to balance his crime- fighting career with his new enrollment at Horizon High, a school for students with genius-level intellect run by headmaster Max Modell. Joining Peter in his ordeals against Jackal, Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Rhino, the Smythes (Spencer and Alistair), and numerous other villains are his classmates Gwen Stacy, Miles Morales, and Anya Corazon, as well as his best friend Harry Osborn. Over the course of the school year, Peter merges with and removes a parasitic alien dubbed the V-252 and trains Miles on how to use his own Spider Powers as an \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" after he also ends up getting bitten by a genetically- modified spider. Peter and his friends eventually discover that Jackal (who is actually Gwen's uncle Raymond Warren) created the spiders that gave them their Spider Powers for the purpose of turning everyone in New York into an army of spider-like monsters dubbed \\"Man-Spiders\\", but Raymond's scheme is thwarted through the teamwork of Peter, Miles, Anya and Harry. During this period, Gwen and Anya develop Spider Powers of their own, with the former assuming the \\"Spider-Gwen\\" alias, and Harry also learns that Peter is Spider-Man. With Osborn Academy destroyed at the climax of the \\"Spider-Island\\" crisis, Harry dons the OsCorp technology and discovers that his father Norman Osborn had orchestrated his expulsion from Horizon High at the school year's beginning as part of his vision of making his son execute Super-Man and be New York's definite hero. Ultimately, Harry chooses to side with Peter instead of his father, and Norman apparently dies in an explosion. As summer vacation begins, Harry takes over his father's business and discovers a hidden chamber filled with Norman's Goblin technology while Max creates a monument of Spider-Man at Horizon High as the school's unofficial mascot. Season 2 Peter navigates through both his sophomore year and his career at the Daily Bugle while finding that he must once again contend with Doctor Octopus as well as the V-252 Symbiote, which has now assumed the name of \\"Venom\\" after it merges itself with his jealous co-worker Eddie Brock. While Peter uncovers a bounty that has been seemingly placed on him by Chameleon, Anya adopts the \\"Spider- Girl\\" alias when her Spider Powers from the \\"Spider-Island\\" incident resurface and forms a \\"Spider Team\\" with Miles and Gwen. Doctor Octopus is revealed to be the true mastermind behind the bounty and successfully manages to swap bodies with Spider-Man, becoming the Superior Spider-Man. Around the same time, Gwen acquires old and new Spider Powers thanks to the Blood Gem relic and begins working alongside Miles and Anya under the \\"Ghost-Spider\\" alias. After being swayed by Peter's memories of Uncle Ben into becoming a hero, Octavius begins working on methods to become more efficient in crime-fighting than Peter ever was, but his ruthlessness prompts Miles to have the Avengers investigate on his behalf. Meanwhile, Peter's consciousness escapes the Living Brain via the Neuro Cortex and downloads himself into Octavius' discarded tentacles after encountering memories of Octavius' past in the process. Octavius (as Peter) re-enrolls at Midtown High and befriends the assistant chemistry teacher Anna Maria Marconi. Discovering how wrong he was about himself and Spider-Man during a fight against a genetically-altered Venom, Octavius reunites Peter's consciousness and body before his tentacles degrade the former into nothing. After saving Anna Maria from Venom, Spider-Man honors Octavius' heroism by placing his consciousness back in his inactive body. Soon after becoming his former self once more, Spider-Man takes it upon himself to rescue the Avengers from Regent, who has been replicating the abilities of the various super villains incarcerated at the prison known as the Cellar to imprison the Avengers in another dimension. Octavius recovers from his coma in time for him and Anna Maria to help Spider-Man free Cloak and Dagger so they can rescue the missing Avengers and defeat Regent. After Spider-Man stops the rampaging speedster Slyde with help from Octavius (now going by Doctor Octopus once more), they discover the existence of a recently formed cult-like organization who are calling themselves the Goblin Nation, armed with the same kind of Goblin technology used by Norman. While investigating Norman's hidden Goblin tech chamber, Spider-Man and Hobgoblin discover the Goblin Nation's leader the Goblin King is none other than Adrian Toomes. Working together with the rest of the Spider Team, they are able to defeat the Goblin Nation's various clans (consisting of Electro's Electro Goblins, Silvermane's Cyber Goblins, and Crossbones' War Goblins). When Toomes takes control of a powerful Goblin Mech in a bid to destroy the city, Octavius stops him by disabling the suit with the Neuro Cortex but fades away into light particles in the process. At Octavius's funeral, Peter reconciles with Gwen, Anya, and Max for what happened when Octavius was Superior Spider-Man. To his surprise, Peter is also re-enrolled at Horizon High thanks to Max receiving a recommendation letter from Octavius prior to the latter's death. Season 3 (Maximum Venom) Two weeks after Octavius' death, Spider-Man finds himself dealing with a machine called the Technovore rampaging through Horizon High and ends up using a synthetic copy of Venom created by Max (who has also been aware of his true identity ever since the downfall of the Goblin Nation) to stop it. Peter and Max later discover that the Technovore's rampage had been orchestrated by the school's new teacher Curt Connors, as part of a mission to investigate Max's \\"corrupt operations\\" involving Venom, on the behalf of a barely-alive Norman Osborn. Upon being accidentally released by Dr. Connors, the original Venom revitalizes himself using his synthetic copy as he escapes to Duncan Valley, where the meteor that brought him to Earth had crashed. Recovering an energy seed that had also been inside of the meteor, Venom uses it to shoot out a beam-like beacon into space, until Spider-Man manages to stop the beacon, the process of which also ultimately kills Venom. However, in response to this beacon, a massive swarm of Klyntar make their way to Earth from Venom's home planet for an invasion. Star-Lord, who with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy, had worked with Spider-Man to deal with a prior Klyntar-related incident, sends Groot to Earth ahead of the swarm with a message to warn Peter about the impending invasion: Peter and Miles decode it with the help of Ironheart, Totally Awesome Hulk, and Doctor Strange, after they all rescue Groot from the clutches of A.I.M. and Baron Mordo. As the first wave of Klyntar makes planetfall, they use the Avengers they possessed on their way to Earth as their advance team to possess the heroes of Earth one-by-one, so the rest of the swarm can quickly do the same to the citizens of New York City, with only a few survivors including Spider-Man, Max, and Aunt May. Convincing Marc Spector to both resume his role as a hero and help him save the Earth, Spider-Man rescues the survivors. Using the Venomized Groot that Max had captured, Spider-Man and company create a synthetic Klyntar named Anti-Venom as an antidote to the Klyntar infestation. After everyone on Earth is cured by the Anti-Venomized Groot, Doctor Strange takes him into space so the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy can be cured. As Earth finishes recovering from the invasion, Peter manages to secure evidence of Max's innocence for the school board, yet is unable to get the necessary testimony from Aleksei Sytsevich due to him being turned into Rhino by Swarm. Peter makes up for the lack of it by giving a compelling one as Spider-Man, only for Dr. Connors to win the trial by blackmailing Peter into unmasking himself, resulting in the school board firing Max and making Connors the interim headmaster until the end of the season. Gwen and Anya are also at first distraught by Spider-Man's mistake about not telling them his real identity, though he figures out how to reconcile with them using advice from Mary Jane Watson after they and Miles defeat Swarm and shut down his operations. Despite being prohibited by the head administrator from being Spider-Man at Horizon High, the school board also decides to keep knowledge of Peter's identity a secret from the public. During the new semester, Connor has been running Horizon High like a dictator and forcing students to turn in their projects but after an acid-based accident caused by Grady reveals evidence of Jackal's return, Spider-Man and Ghost-Spider work to track down Jackal, while Miles and Anya investigate the teacher's lounge for any clues, and discover Dr. Connors has stolen the seed recovered from Venom's meteor only to be ambushed by Chameleon (who has been posing Anya's stepsister Maria). Once Spider-Man and Ghost-Spider locate their friends, they find an injured Norman who survived his death during the first season and is resurrected into a hybrid of Venom and Jackal's DNA known as the Dark Goblin. Norman had recruited Dr. Connors to help him in exchange for the cure for Connors' mutation, but during the Spider Team's fight against the Dark Goblin's party, Connors transforms back into the Lizard as Norman reveals he had lied about the cure's existence. Norman is eventually reverted back to his original human form and is taken into custody alongside Jackal and Chameleon while Swarm (who is actually Miles' father Jefferson Davis) flees after Miles causes him to see the error of his ways. Using a drone hacked by Miles, Peter and his friends expose Norman's conspiracy and manipulation of Dr. Connors to the school board, who in turn reinstate Max as headmaster. Characters Spider Team The Spider Team are the primary protagonists of the series, being Horizon High students with spider-like abilities. The team was first formed during the \\"Spider Island\\" arc, when Spider-Man, Miles, Spider-Gwen, Anya, and Harry banded together to cure everyone of the Man- Spider mutations. The Spider Team was resurged during the \\"Bring On the Bad Guys\\" arc after Anya keeps her powers, and was later officially named as such in \\"The Day Without Spider-Man\\" after Gwen regains her powers from when she was Spider-Gwen. In \\"Vengeance Of Venom\\" Pt. 2, the Spider Team (sans Spider- Man) are among the heroes captured by the Klyntar during their invasion of Earth before being cured by Anti-Venom off-screen. * Spider-Man / Peter Parker (voiced by Robbie Daymond)  The show's teenage protagonist. After he was bitten by a genetically-modified spider during a field trip to Oscorp, Peter tries to balance his crime-fighting and civilian lives as a student in Horizon High and a freelance photographer at the Daily Bugle. Besides the rest of the Spider Team, only Max, Anna Maria, Norman, Venom, Dr. Connors, Eddie, and the board of education know Spider-Man's secret identity. * Ultimate Spider-Man / Miles Morales (voiced by Nadji Jeter)  One of Peter's classmates and close friends at Horizon High and primary partner-in-justice. After being bitten by the Electrolis Arachnatis spider, he is mentored by Spider-Man on how to use his abilities in \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\". Miles is the first person to discover Spider-Man's secret identity, as shown in \\"Kraven's Amazing Hunt\\". Thus far, only Peter, Gwen, Anya, Jefferson, and Octavius know Miles's secret identity. * Ghost-Spider / Gwen Stacy (voiced by Laura Bailey)  One of Peter's classmates and close friends at Horizon High. Unique to this show, she is portrayed as Warren's niece. In Season 1, Gwen briefly takes on the Spider- Gwen alias when New York was exposed to the Jackal's chemicals during the \\"Spider-Island\\" arc.

Reception The series has received a mostly mixed response from critics and audiences, with the low-quality and unimpressive animation, writing, dull and sub-par storylines, rushed introductions to Spider-Man supporting characters and villains, overcrowded cast of characters and the sub-par, rushed handling of stories from the Spider-Man comic-book mythos being criticized, with many deeming the show as one of the weakest Spider-Man adaptations, while the attempted unique take on the Spider-Man mythos was somewhat favorably received and has been met with a more positive response from younger audiences.

Anson as van Tuyl.Romance at the Internet Broadway Database. Synopsis Prologue In his library in Washington Square, New York, Bishop Armstrong learns with disquiet that his grandson Harry is engaged to be married to Lucille Anderson, an actress. Harry says that the bishop has never felt the way he does; in response, the bishop finds a box of mementos (a handkerchief and dried violets) from an affair of long ago, and starts to tell Harry a story. The following scenes are a representation of the story. Act 1 Scene from Romance. Maxine Elliott Theatre, 1913 About 1867, there is an evening reception at the house of Cornelius van Tuyl, a wealthy banker. The guests include Madame Margherita Cavallini, an Italian opera star. Tom, the rector of St Giles (the bishop in younger days) is a friend of van Tuyl, who supports his church work. Van Tuyl expects Tom to say he wants to marry his niece Susan; instead, Tom says he disapproves of his association with Mme Cavallini, who has a bad reputation. When Mme Cavallini (Rita) enters with her admirers, she and Tom immediately notice each other. Tom awkwardly introduces himself to her, and she is interested in him. She says their moment together is like her bouquet of violets, to enjoy before they die. He wants to see her again, and she asks him to come to her hotel apartment. All this time he does not know who she is; as she leaves, she asks van Tuyl to tell him. Act 2 The scene is the study of St Giles' rectory, on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, a few weeks later. Miss Armstrong, Tom's aunt, is anxious about Tom's affair with Rita, and asks van Tuyl to \\"save him from that dreadful woman\\". When Rita arrives, van Tuyl tells her she is amusing herself at Tom's expense. Tom arrives and the others go to tea; he talks to Rita. He says that love is finding the woman you want to live with all your life; she says it is like a little light in all the darkness. He asks her to marry him, but she says there is a reason she cannot. He tells her it will be all right if she repents of her sinful past. He is alarmed when he learns she had a relationship with van Tuyl, but she says it was not serious. Tom announces to van Tuyl that they are engaged, and he congratulates them. But Rita says she was van Tuyl's mistress until she met Tom. Tom is appalled, and Rita leaves. Act 3 In her apartment later that evening, Rita is triumphant after her performance, and speaks from her balcony to the crowd below. Van Tuyl congratulates her. He tries to get her to eat the meal that has been prepared, but she is not hungry. She is going away the next day; he suggests that he goes away with her. She has a pistol, saying she will kill herself: that in the last weeks she has found something good in the world, but now cannot change. Van Tuyl leaves by a back way as Tom arrives. Tom, seeing van Tuyl's card and two glasses, thinks they have had a passionate meeting. Tom passionately says he wants to save Rita from her sinful life, but then declares his love. Rita says she will kill herself if he touches her. Finally he hears the chimes of midnight and the church procession which he has organized; his manner changes and he leaves to join them. Epilogue The scene is as for the prologue; the bishop has finished his story. Harry, misunderstanding that the bishop's purpose was to sympathize with youthful impetuousness rather than encourage it, says he has been an ass to hesitate, and will marry Lucille. Harry's sister Suzette comes in; she sees in the paper an obituary of Mme Cavallini, and unaware of the connection with her grandfather, she reads it out; the opera singer never married. Critical reception The critic Walter Prichard Eaton wrote about the original production:\\"What bishops do in their youth\\". Walter Prichard Eaton, Plays and Players: Leaves from a Critic's Scrapbook (1916), page 66. > This drama... achieves... a consistent and unfailing atmosphere, or perhaps > it would be better to say mood. It is keyed to a certain emotional note, and > it does not slump at any time into the merely sensational.

In 1603, during the Eighty Years War (when Habsburg lost most northern territory; including Middelburg after a long siege), the bishopric was suppressed, without a formal successor, its territory being included in the pre-diocesan Dutch Mission 'Batavia', while its incumbent was transferred to the richer, safer see of Bruges (Brugge) in Flanders (Dutch-speaking part of the countshin in the northwest of Belgium). The 1803.03.22 establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of Breda (later enlarged and promoted to bishopric), including the same territory (then split off from the Diocese of ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch), is considered as a restoration of the Middelburg see.

It is held on the last Thursday and Friday before Christmas on Rusinga Island. The festival was founded by Anne Eboso and administered through Chula Cultural Foundation. The cultural festival is the sole initiative preserving the culture of the Abasuba who are mainly found on the Rusinga Island and Mfangano Island on Lake Victoria on the Kenyan portion of the Lake. Abasuba culture is under pressure from the neighboring Luo community due to assimilation and intermarriage. Suba language has been listed by the United Nations Educational Scientific and cultural Organization (UNESCO) in its Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger as one of the thirteen endangered languages in Kenya where it is classified as vulnerable. The festival addresses societal ills within the Abasuba community such as the sex-for-fish practice that impacts negatively on efforts to curb the spread of HIV. The Rusinga Cultural Festival is a mixed-type of festival; it incorporates more than one item of celebration with music, cultural sporting activities, art and food from traditional Suba cuisine being the main features of the Rusinga Cultural Festival. There is additionally a street procession that is used to invite residents of the Rusinga Island to the festival grounds. The festival producer is a long-standing promoter of culture, education and literacy through book-reading. The Rusinga Festival utilizes a boat-library that also serves the purpose of providing a safe space for discussion of various sensitive issues affecting the Abasuba.  Music  The Rusinga Cultural Festival has performances of both traditional and contemporary music. Traditional music is in form of performances by cultural troupes and Abasuba traditional music groups. The traditional music is performed in Subanese language. The highlights of the cultural performances are at the festival‚Äôs sporting events. Just before the boat races, performers and festival attendees move from the grounds of the festival and move to the waters of Lake Victoria, accompanied by traditional music and dances.  Culture  Abasuba culture is the primary celebration of the Rusinga Cultural Festival. Different facets of Abasuba culture are on display at the festival. Artifacts in clay-work, woodwork and daily Abasuba life showcasing the Abasuba culture are displayed at the festival. The music, cuisine, sporting events and any other event happening at the festival are primarily aimed at promoting and preserving Abasuba culture.  Food  Food at the Rusinga Cultural Festival includes traditional delicacies and modern foods. Some of the Traditional foods available at the festival takes long periods to prepare and is available only for a short period ‚Äì usually the first day of the festival. Delicacies available include traditionally prepared meats, vegetables and other dishes.  Sports  Popular sports at the Rusinga Cultural Festival are Wrestling(Eminyiika), Oluko/Oruko(Ajua) Tug-of-War and Boat Racing. These sports are not unique to the Abasuba community alone, but they are the most powerful and valued sports for the Abasuba. Boats in the races at the Rusinga Cultural Festival are human powered boats. They are manned by teams of seven people; six to paddle and one team leader who doubles as the helmsman. There is a separate category for women at the boat race. Sports in Suba community and at the festival pull large crowds. There are other smaller competitive sports at the festival including board games.  Tourism  Tours around the Suba islands of Lake Victoria ‚Äì Rusinga Island, Takawiri Island and Mfangano Island are available to attendees of the Rusinga cultural Festival. The festival organizers often work with tours and travel companies to facilitate these tours. The festival has opened up the Western Kenya tourism circuit and exposed it to both domestic and international tourists.  Community involvement  Abasuba community members are highly engaged in preparation, management and running of the Rusinga Cultural Festival. This results in very high attendance of the festival. There is no age restriction to attend the festival, and it is open entry. Issues affecting the Abasuba are addressed at the festival. The festival provides a forum for discussing health & sanitation, HIV, banking, social security protection and other things affecting the Abasuba community.  Organizing the festival   Financing  The Rusinga Cultural Festival is financed by partners and sponsors. Relevant government departments, private sector and various embassies are the major partners of the Rusinga Cultural festival. Partnerships and Sponsorships are both financial and in-kind. Administration of the festival is through the Chula Cultural Foundation.  Communication  The Rusinga Cultural Festival utilizes both mainstream and new media. Access to mainstream media in the form of broadcast media is provided through partnerships with media houses. Digital media is a major communication channel for the festival. The 2016 festival utilized the services Mutahi Muriithi as its digital media and publicity consultant.

He graduated with a bachelor's degree in jazz performance in 2016 on the Jazzl program, the department of Jazz at Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim (NTNU). Zabulionis received attention for his debut album Changing Tides (2016). Additional musicians are Ivan Blomqvist (piano), Arne Martin Nybo (guitar), Kristian B.

Max participated in the first known public demonstration against human rights violations on intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996. The event is now commemorated by Intersex Awareness Day. Early life Max Beck has described how his sex was not determinable at birth. Through testing it was discovered that he had mosaic XY/X0 chromosomes. His gonads were removed, and he was raised female, with yearly visits to endocrinologists and urologists. Beck's genitals were described as not yet \\"finished\\". Puberty \\"came in pill form\\", with a vaginoplasty, and he later attempted suicide. He survived and later met Tamara Alexander, later his wife, and subsequently switched hormone treatment to testosterone. The couple married on February 12, 2000. Alexander describes how the medical management of Beck's childhood is an \\"analogue for childhood sexual abuse\\", where disclosure and living were a blessing. Activism Beck has described how his activism began in 1996. In that year, he and Morgan Holmes acted as spokespersons for ISNA and participants in a demonstration outside the conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics on October 26, 1996 alongside allies from Transsexual Menace including Riki Wilchins. Holmes has written that the event was intended not as a demonstration but as participation in the conference. She states that the pair went to deliver an address, \\"on long-term outcomes and to challenging their still-prevailing opinion that cosmetic surgery to \\"fix\\" intersexed genitals was the best course of action\\", but were \\"met, officially, with hostility and were escorted out of the conference by security guards\\". Following the event, the Academy published a press release stating that \\"From the viewpoint of emotional development, 6 weeks to 15 months seems the optimal period for genital surgery.\\" Beck appears in the 2005 documentary Middle Sexes: Redefining He and She. The film was nominated for a 2006 GLAAD Media Award. Beck's wife, Tamara Beck, appears in the film Intersexion, recalling their relationship. Death Beck died of mullerian/vaginal cancer at age 42 in early 2008, leaving his wife Tamara and two children. In response to his death, Cheryl Chase stated that clinicians were unable to understand the \\"health issues of someone with his condition\\".

History  Karry Youya The name Karry made its first appearance in the early 2000s as a commercial vehicle model within the Chery range (the Karry A18). It was a box version of the Chery Fulwin (licensed version of the first generation Seat Toledo). Subsequently Karry launched other commercial vehicles re-branded Karry creating a sub-brand to distinguish it from the remaining purely automotive production. In 2009 all commercial vehicle activities were separated with the creation of the Chery Commercial Vehicle based in Anhui and the Karry Auto (or simply Karry) brand was created. In addition to vans and other small minivans designed specifically for the Chinese market, a pick-up (Karry Aika) was launched on the Isuzu TF chassis and a design copied from the Chevrolet Silverado and a light truck with cabin similar to the European and Japanese models (like Iveco EuroCargo and Mitsubishi-Fuso Canter). Original Chery Karry From 2014 the range expands also introducing minivans designed specifically for the Chinese market and projects developed with the Chery New Energy division to bring the first electric vehicles into production. In late 2016, Karry and the Chery Commercial Vehicle division began the design of low- cost SUVs and off-road vehicles which, however, were subsequently launched by another brand created by Chery, Jetour, to avoid internal competition with the parent company. Today the Karry brand is present only on the Chinese market, however some models are marketed by the parent company Chery with its own brand both in South America and in some countries of Southeast Asia.

The division traced its lineage back to the World War II 3rd Tank Corps, formed in the spring of 1942. The corps received its baptism of fire in the Zhizdra-Bolkhov Offensive during the summer and spent the fall in reserve. In early 1943, the corps fought in Operation Gallop and was destroyed in the Third Battle of Kharkov in late February. The corps was rebuilt in the following months and joined the 2nd Tank Army in June. The corps fought in the Battle of Kursk in July and in the Chernigov-Pripyat Offensive in August and September. In early 1944, it fought in the Korsun- Shevchenkovsky Offensive and the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. For its actions in the latter, the corps received the honorific \\"Uman\\" and the Order of Suvorov. During the summer of 1944, the corps fought in the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive, advancing into Poland. For its actions in the offensive, the corps received the Order of the Red Banner and in November became a guards unit, the 9th Guards Tank Corps, along with the rest of the army. The corps fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive and the East Pomeranian Offensive in early 1945. For its actions, the corps received the Order of Lenin in April. The corps then fought in the Berlin Offensive, ending the war in the German capital. In the summer of 1945 the corps became a tank division and was relocated to Neustrelitz, becoming part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG). In 1965, the division was renumbered as the 16th Guards Tank Division. The division served with the GSFG through the Cold War and after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992 began a withdrawal to Russia which was completed in 1993. The division remained at Markovsky, Perm Krai until its 1997 disbandment, when it became a storage base. The storage base was disbanded in 2009.  World War II   Formation  The formation of the 3rd Tank Corps began on 31 March and ended on 10 May 1942 in Tula. 31 March was considered its anniversary. Major General Dmitry Mostovenko became the corps commander. In April, the 50th and 51st Tank Brigade joined the corps. The 47th Tank Brigade and 3rd Motor Rifle Brigade also became part of the corps, which became part of the Bryansk Front. On 28 April, the corps had 138 tanks, including 30 KV tanks, 60 T-34 tanks, and 48 T-60 light tanks.  Zhizdra- Bolkhov and Kozelsk Offensives  The corps became part of the Western Front reserve on 28 June. On 5 July, it was subordinated to the 61st Army as its exploitation force for the upcoming Zhizdra-Bolkhov Offensive. The offensive was a Soviet counterattack against the German 2nd Panzer Army defending the northern part of the Oryol salient, and was an attempt to divert German troops from their attacks on the Bryansk Front and also to draw the 4th Panzer Army away from Voronezh. Despite the 61st Army failing to achieve a breakthrough in the direction of Bolkhov when the offensive began on 5 July, the 3rd Tank Corps with 192 tanks was committed to the fight two days later. Attacking heavily fortified positions, the corps suffered heavy losses from anti-tank fire. 61st Army's attack was halted five days later without making gains. From the end of the offensive on 10 July to 11 August, the corps was located in the Bely area. From 19 August it was under the operational control of the 3rd Tank Army. From 22 August, the corps fought in the Kozelsk Offensive with the rest of the army, attempting to eliminate the German salient near Kozelsk. The offensive was unsuccessful due to fuel shortages and German air superiority, and ended with only 200 tanks remaining in the army. The offensive was halted on 9 September, but before that, on 8 September, the 3rd Tank Corps had been withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Four days later, the corps moved to the Kubinka area for rebuilding. On 4 September, Colonel (promoted to Major General on 10 November) Maxim Sinenko took command of the corps after Mostovenko was promoted to command the Western Front's Armored and Mechanized Forces. The 3rd Motor Rifle Brigade was converted into a mechanized brigade and transferred to the 3rd Mechanized Corps on 10 September. In early October, the corps was relocated to the Kaluga area. All three tank brigades received new T-34s, which became part of the first and second companies of each tank battalion. The third companies of the battalions were re-equipped with the T-70 light tank. The corps conducted training during its time in the reserve. On 10 December, the 57th Motor Rifle Brigade arrived from the Ural Military District, replacing the 3rd Motor Rifle Brigade. On 24 December, the corps received the order to prepare to move by rail to the Southwestern Front. Three days later, the corps began its rail journey to the front.  Operation Gallop  On 28 December, the corps became part of the Southwestern Front. At the time it had 164 tanks, including 98 T-34s, 42 T-70s, and 24 T-60s. The corps unloaded at the Kalach rail station and from there its tank brigades conducted a 300 kilometer march to its positions for the forthcoming offensive. From 22 January it was under the operational control of the 6th Army. On 25 January, it became part of Group Popov. The corps fought in Operation Gallop, a Soviet counteroffensive after the Battle of Stalingrad, which attempted to encircle all German troops east of Donetsk. Group Popov was assigned to advance southwards 270 kilometers and capture Mariupol, which would cut off Army Group Don. The corps was given the mission of cooperating with the 57th Guards Rifle Division in advancing southwest from the 6th Army sector to Sloviansk, which was to be captured by 4 February. The corps would then join the 4th Guards Tank Corps in an advance on Kramatorsk. In early February, the Soviet advance was blocked by the resistance of the 7th Panzer Division in Sloviansk. The tank corps of Group Popov were brought in as reinforcements, including the 3rd, and they were able to encircle the city, which fell after holding out for more than a week. Following the advance of the 38th Guards Rifle Division, the corps reached the area northeast of Sloviansk by 4 February. The corps was then ordered to reinforce the 4th Guards Tank Corps, dug in at Kramatorsk and fighting attacks from the 7th Panzer Division. The 3rd Tank Corps joined the 4th Guards at Kramatorsk on 5 February. Both corps numbered a total of 60 tanks at this time. The German troops were reinforced by the 333rd Infantry Division, which claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on both corps, which now defended Kramatorsk with their tanks. On 7 February, the 3rd Tank Corps and 4th Guards Tank Corps were ordered to destroy German troops at Sloviansk and Kostiantynivka, and then advance on Krasnoarmiysk and encircle Stalino from the west. On 11 February the 3rd Tank Corps took over the defenses of the 4th Guards Tank Corps as the latter advanced on Krasnoarmiysk. Attacks from the 333rd Infantry Division recaptured eastern Kramatorsk from the 3rd Tank Corps, and the corps stopped an assault from the north of the city by Group Balck on 13 February. On the evening of 18 February the corps was ordered to turn over its positions at Kramatorsk to arriving Soviet infantry units and move south to Krasnoarmiysk by 20 February to assist the 4th Guards Tank Corps. Before the 3rd could reach the positions of the 4th Guards, the 11th Panzer Division completed the encirclement of the 4th Guards by capturing Novo-Alekseyevsky and Aleksandrovka, blocking the advance of the 3rd Tank Corps on 19 February. The 4th Guards held out in Krasnoarmiysk until the night of 20‚Äì21 February when its remnants broke out.  Third Battle of Kharkov  The corps with twelve tanks was pushed back by the German counterattack which began the Third Battle of Kharkov on 19 February, suffering heavy losses to the 11th Panzer Division in the Andreyevka area. The corps was forced to retreat northwards and was attacked by SS Division Wiking at Novopetrivka on 22 February. By 24 February the corps and the remnants of the Mobile Group were providing limited tank support to the defensive line of the 195th Rifle Division northwest of Stepanivka. By the end of 26 February the corps had been forced back by SS Wiking's attacks to the area northwest of Barvinkove, retreating along with the 10th Tank Corps. Two days later it defended positions to the east of the 195th Rifle Division, south of Balakliia and the Donets River, against the 17th Panzer Division. Two brigades of the corps defended Barvinkove along with remnants of Group Popov and the 1st Guards Army until the German breakthrough to the Donets on 28 February. The remnants of the 3rd Tank Corps then withdrew across the ice over the Donets.  Kursk  On 11 March the corps was transferred to Stavka reserve for rebuilding in the Alexeyevsky District, Belgorod Oblast. In April, the 234th Mortar Regiment, 881st Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 121st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and 74th Motorcycle Battalion joined the corps. On 1 June it became part of the 2nd Tank Army. The corps fought in the Battle of Kursk during the summer of 1943. The corps was positioned in the center of the 13th Army sector behind the third defensive line. First Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive On 1 April 1944, 3rd Tank Corps was in 2nd Tank Army, and had recently come under command of Lieutenant General of Tank Forces Vasily Mishulin. 2nd Ukrainian Front was advancing towards the Romanian border in the culmination of the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. On the morning of 8 April the Front commander, Marshal Ivan Konev, ordered an advance towards the Romanian town of T√¢rgu Frumos. 3rd Tank made up part of the shock group, despite having long columns of tanks and trucks stretched out tens of kilometers to the rear along the mud-clogged roads. Late in the afternoon of 9 April, the forward detachments of 3rd and 16th Tank Corps, which were already locked in a struggle north of Podu Iloaiei with a battle group of 24th Panzer Division, were reinforced by the 78th and 180th Rifle Divisions. Despite this, the German defenses held. By 12 April, 2nd Tank Army had managed to concentrate about 15 km north of Podu Iloaiei, and Konev ordered an attack to eliminate the salient held by 24th Panzer. This attack, which did not involve 3rd Tank, was driven back to its starting positions. The next day, 3rd Tank Corps, with about 80 tanks supported by its own 57th Motor Rifle Brigade and the 93rd Guards Rifle Division made modest gains until being counterattacked by two armored battle groups against its flanks, which brought the assault to a halt and temporarily ended the Soviet offensive on this sector. Konev planned a second drive on T√¢rgu Frumos to start on 27 April, but due to a complex regrouping of his forces this had to be pushed back to 2 May. The operation was preceded by a diversion on 25 April in the direction of Jassy, in which the 103rd Tank Brigade took part. Prior to the real offensive, by 1 May the Corps was reinforced with a complete heavy tank penetration regiment and a heavy self-propelled artillery regiment, so that it fielded a total of 50 tanks and self-propelled guns, including 27 T-34s in its organic tank brigades, 5 IS-85 tanks in the attached 8th Guards Penetration Tank Regiment, and 18 ISU-152s in the 375th Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment.Charles C. Sharp states that this regiment was still equipped with SU-152 guns when it was assigned to 3rd Tank Corps; Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Nafziger, 1998, p. 38 The mission of 2nd Tank Army was to support 27th Army's penetration, capture T√¢rgu Frumos by enveloping the town from the east, and to exploit by rolling up the German/Romanian left wing and capture Jassy by enveloping the city from the southwest. The attack sector was still being defended primarily by 24th Panzer, supported by elements of the Grossdeutchland Division. After a 30-minute artillery preparation, and against stubborn resistance, 35th Guards Rifle Corps, in coordination with 2nd Tank Army units, wedged into the German defenses and advanced 4 ‚Äì 6 km along the T√¢rgu Frumos axis by 1100 hrs., at which point counterattacks by infantry and up to 70 tanks pressed the attackers back somewhat. Following this:In the late afternoon the Corps halted its attacks to rest and regroup and, if possible, resume its assault the next morning. However, the Germans also regrouped overnight, bringing up elements of the 3rd SS Panzer Division from LVII Panzer Corps reserves. On the morning of 3 May, 3rd Tank Corps was concentrated on a 1.5 km sector west of the HirlauT√¢rgu Frumos road. Konev was still confident that he had sufficient armor to, if not envelop Jassy, at least take the illusive prize of T√¢rgu Frumos. But the German strength in both tanks and anti-tank guns denied any success to the new assault. Tanks that passed through the German infantry lines were shot up by anti-tank assets in the rear. While elements of 2nd Tank Army penetrated for a second time to the northern outskirts of the objective, losses forced them back to the start line by the afternoon. A further effort on 4 May gained nothing, and by day's end Konev had given up all hopes of resuming his offensive. In the course of the fighting from 1‚Äì8 May, the Corps reported the non-recoverable loss of 21 tanks and SUs from the total of 50 at start. The Corps further reported:The Corps also reported personnel losses of 80 men killed and 321 men wounded. Near the end of May Konev planned to renew his offensive by regrouping 2nd Tank Army and other forces north and northwest of Jassy. This was pre-empted on 30 May when German Eighth Army launched Operation \\"Sonja\\" to drive Soviet forces back from the city. 3rd Tank Corps was in a laager around the town of Focuri when the attack began; at this point the entire tank army was fielding about 60 tanks in total, including about ten IS models. \\"Sonja\\" was halted on the third day after making gains, but was soon followed by Operation \\"Katja\\" on 2 June. At mid-morning that day, the Corps was ordered to the vicinity of Movileni Station, where it fended off an attack by forward elements of Grossdeutchland. By nightfall stable defenses had been established just south of the station along with remnants of 202nd and 206th Rifle Divisions. By 5 June, 3rd Tank was aiding in the defense at Epureni when \\"Katja\\" came to a halt. These two operations rocked the Soviet forces enough to end any immediate plans for a continued offensive of their own; this sector would remain quiet until 20 August, when the 2nd Jassy-Kishinev Offensive began.  Postwar  By 1 December 1945, in accordance with a directive dated 10 June 1945, the corps became the 9th Guards Tank Division. The division was stationed at Neustrelitz, and around the same time the 2nd Guards Tank Army became a mechanized army. In 1957, the army became a tank army again. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered as the 16th Guards Tank Division to \\"preserve historical traditions\\" and in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the end of World War II. In 1989, the 67th Guards Tank Regiment became the 723rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment. The Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, resulting in the withdrawal of remaining units from Germany. In 1992, the 723rd was relocated to Chaykovsky, Perm Krai and the rest of the division followed soon after. By 30 June 1993, the relocation was completed and the division was based in Markovsky, Perm Krai. Markovsky was purpose-built for the division to provide housing to its soldiers, and construction was paid for by the German government under the withdrawal agreements. In March 1995, the 723rd Regiment was sent to Chechnya to fight in the First Chechen War. At Grozny, the regiment was used to form the 205th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade. In March 1997, the division was reorganized into the 5967th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base for armored troops. The former artillery regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Division became part of the storage base. In December 2009, the storage base was disbanded.

He was a pianist and guitarist specializing in genres ranging from soul music to pop music and to funk. Through their brief career, Segun Bucknor and the Assembly released a variety of music dealing with Nigerian culture or political influence which was described by the BBC as an \\"interesting slice of Nigerian pop music history and culture\\". Bucknor was the father of media personality Tosyn Bucknor and businesswoman Funke Bucknor-Obruthe. Early life Bucknor was born in Lagos on 29 March 1946. He was educated at King's College and Columbia University, New York. He was a member of the school's band and choir. He started out playing the tin whistle as a junior band member but later graduated to learning the guitar and piano. During this time, he apprenticed under Roy Chicago's band. Career In 1964, he was a member of a newly formed band, the Hot Four. He was the band's organist and lead guitar player; other members were Mike Nelson Cole, the band leader and Sunmi Smart Cole, the drummer. The group played regularly in Lagos clubs such as Surulere night club. However, Bucknor traveled to the United States to study for a couple of years. During his time in the United States, he was influenced by Ray Charles. After his return in 1968, the band received funding from a trio of investors and upon the exit of Mike Nelson Cole, Bucknor became the band leader. In 1969, the name of the band became Segun Bucknor and the Assembly. The group recorded soul songs including \\"Lord Give Me Soul\\" and \\"I Will Love You No Matter How\\". Gradually the group migrated from soul songs to a style of afrobeat; in performance a dancing trio called the Sweet Things was included. Bucknor was known for establishing politics into his music. In 1970, the band released \\"Son of 15 January\\", The Son of 15 January treating the assassination of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, which occurred on 15 January 1966. In the 1970s, the band released more politically charged songs, \\"Sorrow, Sorrow, Sorrow\\", \\"Poor Man No Get Brother\\", before its popularity began to slip around the mid-1970s. Bucknor retired from music after receiving threats due to his political views. After Segun Bucknor and the Assembly disbanded in 1975, Bucknor dedicated his time to journalism. He wrote about political corruption, the same concept as during his musical career. Bucknor kept a low profile during the 1980s and 1990s due to low popularity and wanting to focus on his family. He made rare musical appearances at cafes during the early 2000s. In recent years, he was kept out of the public by poor health. He made a few broadcasts on his daughter Tosyn Bucknor's social media account. In 2002, the BBC published a review covering Bucknor's career from 1969 through 1975. It praises Bucknor's \\"reissue of various recordings made from 1969 to 1975 [which] represents an interesting slice of Nigerian pop music history and culture\\". Style Bucknor was noted for switching between singing and shouting from singing alone, floating above every instrument, or in a clear loud voice. The drums, percussion, guitar, bass, keys and horns would be accessories to his vocals. The progression of his sound is more circular and rhythmic, floating around you, and dancing would be involved in his music. His lyrics were in English and Yoruba. Personal life Bucknor was married to Sola Bucknor until his death in 2017. Together, they had two children: Tosyn Bucknor, a media personality, and Funke Bucknor-Obruthe, a businesswoman. Bucknor died in Lagos in the early hours of 11 August 2017 after suffering from multiple strokes at the age of 71. His death was announced by his daughter Funke on Facebook. At the time of his death, he was suffering from hypertension and diabetes.

Written during the Nazi occupation of France, it was premiered in London in English by the BBC in 1945. It was first performed in French in 1946 in Brussels, then in Paris on 22 May 1947. The work was published by √âditions Salabert. Cherished as the summit of the composer's work and a masterpiece by musical critics, the cantata is a hymn to Libert√©, victorious over tyranny.  Genesis   Meeting with Paul √âluard  The meeting of Francis Poulenc and Paul √âluard dates from 1916 or 1917(p. 122) during the First World War, at the Parisian bookstore of his friend Adrienne Monnier. When the composer Georges Auric met the writer around 1919, he suggested to Poulenc to set texts by √âluard to music.(p. 123) √âluard was the only surrealist writer who tolerated music,(p. 95) and the musicologist Peter Jost listed the works of Georges Auric and Francis Poulenc on his texts: six for Auric and 34 for Poulenc, augmented by three choral works including Figure humaine.(p. 121) The poems of the cantata are among the most famous by √âluard. They express the \\"suffering of the people of France\\" reduced to silence and the hope of the \\"final triumph of freedom over tyranny\\".(p. 183)  Composition of the cantata  Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne where the cantata was written The Second World War was a pivotal period in the life of the composer. In the Entretiens avec Claude Rostand, he specifies \\"Some privileged persons, of whom I was one, had the comfort of receiving morning letters, marvellous typed poems, below whose names we guessed the signature of Paul √âluard. This is how I received most of the poems Po√©sie et V√©rit√© 42.(p. 182) Poulenc rented a small two-room apartment in Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne and began composing a violin concerto at the request of Ginette Neveu but quickly abandoned this work. A hypothesis advanced by Renaud Machart mentions the genesis of this cantata. He suggests that a play on √âluard's poem Libert√© poem would have been commissioned in March 1943 by Henri Screpel, the then director of \\"Les Discophiles Fran√ßais\\", in parallel with another commission for a choral work by Louis de Vocht and the choir of Sainte-C√©cile of Antwerp.(p. 139) The composition of the cantata ended at the end of the summer of 1943. Poulenc's correspondence with his intimate friend Genevi√®ve Sienkiewicz evokes the process of writing Figure humaine. Retired to Beaulieu, he wrote to his friend in August 1943: \\"I am working on a cantata a capella on poems by √âluard. (...) I have already done the 3/4 of this cycle and I am not dissatisfied with it\\".Letter dated August 1943, Beaulieu, (p. 252) He evokes the sad apartment where he resides in Beaulieu with a view of the bell tower and states: \\"It was by contemplating it, solid and so French, that I conceived the music of Libert√©Letter dated August 1945, (p. 254) which closes the cantata. The publisher Paul Rouart agreed to publish the work despite the Occupation and sent it to London, which allowed it to be created by the BBC in 1945. The training required complicated its execution, but in his Entretiens avec Claude Rostand Poulenc declares his wish that this \\"act of faith may be expressed without the aid of the instrument, through the mere voice of the human voice\\".(p. 186)  Premiere  Figure humaine was premiered in English by the BBC on 25 March 1945,The date of 25 March 1945 is advanced by Myriam Chimenes in the edition of a part of the unpublished correspondence of Poulenc with Genevi√®ve Sienkiewicz then in Brussels (Belgium) in French on 2 December 1946 by the Ch≈ìurs de la radiodiffusion flamande under the direction of Paul Collaer. The French premiere took place at the in Paris on 22 May 1947.  Reception and legacy  According to biographer Henri Hell, it is in the choral domain that Francis Poulenc wrote his most accomplished works,Sept Chansons pour ch≈ìur a capella, the Messe en sol majeur, Chanson √† boire, Quatre motets pour un temps de p√©nitence, Stabat Mater, Gloria, Sept r√©pons des t√©n√®bres leaning more to a cappella works than to accompanied ones(p. 115) and describes Figure humaine as one of the most striking works of contemporary choral music,(p. 181) \\"wonderfully polyphonic, rich and complex sound texture\\". However, the composition of the double chorus makes its execution difficult, and the work was only resumed on 27 May 1959 at salle Gaveau in Paris for the composer's 60th anniversary. The cantata is considered by some to be the absolute masterpiece of the composer.(p. 138) In a letter dated October 28, 1943 addressed to his friend the Princess of Polignac, Poulenc confides \\"I believe that this is what I did best. It is in any case a major work for me if it is not for French music\\".(p. 140)  Structure and analysis  Signature of Paul √âluard, author of Libert√©, a poem from Po√©sie et v√©rit√© The cantata is written for a double mixed choir and twelve real parts and is divided into eight chants: # De tous les printemps du monde # En chantant, les servantes s'√©lancent # Aussi bas que le silence # Toi ma patiente # Riant du ciel et des plan√®tes # Le jour m'√©tonne et la nuit me fait peur # La menace sous le ciel rouge # Libert√©  De tous les printemps du monde  This first song is of a duration of 2 minutes 40. It develops a final which possesses reminiscences of S√©cheresses.(p. 110)  En chantant, les servantes s'√©lancent  This second song has an execution time of about 2 minutes. Of a quasi-instrumental writing, notably in the repetition of the sung notes \\"la, la, la\\", it is written in the manner of a \\"Scherzo\\" and presents a rhythm more pronounced than the other songs, more melodic and harmonic.  Aussi bas que le silence  This third song has a duration of 1 minute 40 seconds.  Toi ma patiente  This fourth song has a duration of 2 minutes. If the cantata conjugates the emotions, regret, pain, violence, sadness, it is tenderness that emerges from Toi ma patiente for the first solo chorus. There is a harmonious resemblance of this song with Une barque sur l'oc√©an from the Miroirs by Maurice Ravel.  Riant du ciel et des plan√®tes  The fifth song has a run time of one minute.  Le jour m'√©tonne et la nuit me fait peur  This sixth song has a duration of 2 minutes. The tenderness that emanates from the fourth song Toi ma patiente is revealed again in this episode. The second solo choir intones a \\"melody of a sad and heart-rending sweetness,(p. 184) accompanied by a murmur by the other voices of the choir. Considered by Renaud Machart as the most moving passage in the cantata, this song is a melody shedding \\"on a harmony of splendid simplicity\\".  La menace sous le ciel rouge  This seventh song is of a duration of 3 minutes. \\"Carried away and rough\\", this episode starts with a fugue begun by the altos choir of the first chorus, then resumed together by the two choirs until the words La pourriture avait du c≈ìur. The movement gives way to the initial tempo where the two choirs sing together, first pianissimo, then crescendo until the end of a \\"magnificent magnitude\\". A long silence introduces the eighth and last part of the cantata, Libert√©.  Libert√©  This eighth and last song has an execution time of about 4 minutes. A true hymn to \\"freedom,\\" or according to Henri Hell of the \\"litanies of Liberty\\", this song based on the poem by √âluard which includes 21 stanzas of four verses built on the model of the first: It is only after the last stanza that the word Libert√© breaks out, as if to emphasize it better. Emotions appear in each stropes, softness, tenderness, sadness, strength and violence, moving from \\"one to the other with an invisible suppleness\\".(p. 185) The final bars are notoriously challenging, with the highest soprano in each chorus required to hit an E6 at the work's climactic conclusion.

Si Phraya Road (, ) is a road in Bang Rak District, Bangkok, Thailand. It divides the areas of Maha Phruettharam and Si Phraya Subdistricts. Built in 1906 by four noblemen of the rank phraya (hence the name, which means 'four phraya), the road runs from Si Phraya Pier at the mouth of the Phadung Krung Kasem Canal to Sam Yan Intersection, where it meets the Phaya Thai and Rama IV Roads. History At the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries, the area beyond Bangkok's old city boundary marked by Phadung Krung Kasem Canal was seeing rapid growth, with increasing numbers of Western expatriates and well-to-do members of society settling in the area that is now Bang Rak District. Enterprising businessmen, the first of whom was Luang Sathon Rajayutka, who built Sathon Road around 1890, made large profits through development of the area. Several investors followed suit, including four noblemen of the rank phraya who bought land between Phadung Krung Kasem Canal and Surawong Road, and built a road through the area, linking Charoen Krung and Hua Lamphong (now Rama IV) Roads. The four men were Phraya Inthrathibodi Siharatrongmueang, Phraya Phiphatkosa, Phraya Noraritratchahat, and Phraya Noranatphakdi. A fifth nobleman, later to become Phraya Sunthonphimon, was also a partner, though he held the title of Luang Manatmanit (a lesser rank) at the time. They donated the road for public use, and King Chulalongkorn named the road Si Phraya to commemorate the act. The road was officially opened by the King on 15 November 1906. The road ran from the area of Captain Bush Lane (also later known as \\"Si Phraya Pier\\", after the road), near the mouth of Phadung Krung Kasem Canal where the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was located, to Wat Hua Lamphong, which is now on the corner of Sam Yan intersection. The United Club had been located on its corner with Charoen Krung since the 1880s, and the intersection soon became a fashionable European shopping centre. The road was home to members of the upper class, high-ranking officials, and Western expatriates. Some historic buildings still stand along the road and its side streets.

Because he was the only one that looked at Finis as a human instead of a weapon, she fell in love with him and so did he. He is killed by Finis, who did not know it was him; after Prince Rudo fooled her into executing a traitor. He reincarnated several time during different eras; such as being witness to Finis's being burned at the stake to a bespectacled scientist who is married with a daughter; meeting Finis in some form; and in some cases, witnessing her Song of Mortality firsthand. ; : :Corte is Finis's personal maid who is one other person who cared for her as a human.

Talgia dueled him, but cheated using one of Weissen's inventions causing him to burn Talgia's right hand. After he and his men witness Rin use song to heal Henry, he decides to attack Rin's village; once again crossing paths with Talgia; which resulted in the destruction of the village.

With the beginning of the war, Bazra and the army started to use his inventions for killing purposes by enhancing the destructive nature of Finis's songs; to which Dr. Weissen disapproved of. As such, they submerged his entire lab, drowned his lab assistants, and stole his inventions, in addition to making him lose hope. Upon meeting Rin and her companions, she saved his lab and he lets Al stay with him as his assistant. He was the best friend of Talgia and was surprised to learn that Rin was his granddaughter. He is also the first to learn from Rin about the consequence of singing the Song of Healing during the Starsong Festival. ; : :Talgia is Al, Rin and Mel's grandfather who strongly disapproves of Rin singing, revealing that he knew about her power ever since she was young as he knew the Capital would attempt to use Rin as a weapon just like Finis. Before he moved to the village, he was a strong commander and general in the army until he started to realize its brutal methods of violence and bloodshed. He dueled with Bazra in attempts from stopping him from using the Song of Mortality; but lost due to Bazra using one of Weissen's echo devices, which burned his right arm. However, Rin used her Song of Healing to heal his arm; thus vowed to protect Rin from the Capital. He was also a good friend of Weissen. ; : :Berrow is burly bearded man who wields a giant axe.

However, overtime and witnessing Henry's resolve, he begins to respect him. He also comes to befriend Finis. After the end of the war, he swears loyalty to Henry. It is unclear of his first demise, either by execution for swearing loyalty to Henry or the Song of Mortality. :His alternate is no different from his past self, but seems to be more cheerful. He serves as a member of Henry's rebellion against the Capital. ; : :Snore is skinny man who wields a saber. Like Berrow, was a mercenary who served the front lines. He also comes to befriend Finis. After the end of the war, he swears loyalty to Henry.

Family and early career Suat Dervi≈ü was born in either 1904 or 1905 in Istanbul. She was born into an aristocratic family. Her father, ƒ∞smail Dervi≈ü, was a gynecologist, and a professor at the Medical Faculty of Istanbul University. Her mother, Hesna Hanƒ±m, was the daughter of a slave girl in the entourage of Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. Suat had one sister, Hamiyet, who received a musical education at several conservatories in Germany. Her parents' relationship was monogamous, and they were described as a reliable family, who were supportive of Suat. As a child, Dervi≈ü used to wear a burqa. Dervi≈ü received private tutoring in literature, music, French, and German. Between 1919 and 1920 she lived with her sister Hamiyet in Germany, and was a student at the Berlin University. She began to write about Turkey for German magazines, including Berliner Zeitung, and published her first book in 1920, titled Kara Kitap (Black book). She would go on to publish ten more novels between 1920 and 1932. Dervi≈ü‚Äôs early novels examined themes of gender, class, and women's psychology. They also often used an urban setting, which was unusual for the period she was writing in. A reviewer stated that \\"[Suat Dervi≈ü], who is more objective and modern than Halide Edib [the most famous woman writer of the time], is by no means less profound‚Äù. She also worked as a freelance journalist. Among the events she reported on was the Conference of Lausanne, at which the post-World War I fate of Turkey was decided. Her early novels have been referred to as the first gothic novels in the Turkish language. Return to Turkey Dervi≈ü's father died in 1932, upon which she went back to Turkey. She became a member of several intellectual circles. She had joined Serbest Cumhuriyet Fƒ±rkasƒ± (Liberal Republican Party), a political party in the Turkish opposition, in 1930. Among other things, the party advocated for giving women the right to vote. At some point in the 1930s she unsuccessfully contested local elections. Her party was eventually banned, and Dervi≈ü herself became more influenced by Marxist thinking. She became a writer for Yeni Edebiyat (New literature). Dervi≈ü continued to work as a freelance journalist; in 1935, she wrote about the Congress of the International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship (IAWSEC) in Istanbul for the daily paper Cumhuriyet (Republic), and in 1936 wrote about the Montreux Conference. While working for Cumhuriyet, she undertook a project of interviewing twelve international feminists, among whom was Dutch activist Rosa Manus. She traveled to the Soviet Union twice, and wrote a book about her experiences titled Ni√ßin Sovyetler Birliƒüi‚Äônin Dostuyum? (Why am I a friend of the Soviet Union?). The book was highly controversial in Turkey. Leftist activism Dervi≈ü had at least three marriages, to Selami ƒ∞zzet Sedes, Nizamettin Nazif Tepedelenlioƒülu, and to Re≈üad Fuat Baraner. Baraner was the leader of the Turkish Communist Party (TKP), which was banned at the time. On March 10, 1944, Dervi≈ü and her husband were arrested for \\"illegal communist activity\\" along with other members of the party. Dervi≈ü was sentenced to eight months in jail. Dervi≈ü, had been pregnant during the investigation, but had a miscarriage. Her husband remained in prison until 1950, and was arrested again in 1951. Due to her political views and her arrest, Dervi≈ü had difficulty finding a job, and took to using a pseudonym in her published work. Dervi≈ü left Turkey in 1953, as a result of continual harassment from the government. Dervi≈ü lived in several countries outside Turkey during the period 1953‚Äì1963, mostly in France. She published novels in French during this time. Although well received in France, her work was controversial in Turkey due to her support for women's rights, which was often a matter of debate even among leftist individuals. She lived again with Baraner from 1963 until 1968, when he died. Dervi≈ü was among those who founded the Devrimci Kadƒ±nlar Birliƒüi (Socialist Women‚Äôs Association), in 1970. The stated aims of the group were to create a revolutionary women‚Äôs movement and raise women‚Äôs consciousness. At the same time she published Fosforlu Cevriye (Radiant Cevriye, 1968), which explored the lives of marginalized women in Istanbul. It would prove to be her most popular novel, and was also adapted into a film, as well as a stage production in 2016. Dervi≈ü became known for her outspokenness in response to discriminatory statements made about her, once remarking \\"I am not ashamed of being a woman, and I am proud of being a writer. That title is my sole wealth, my only pride and my bread.\\" Death and legacy Dervi≈ü died on 23 July 1972. Her legacy became more prominent in the 1990s and 2000s, as more researchers grew interested in it. She was the subject of a biographical book titled Bir Kadƒ±n Bir D√∂nem: Suat Dervi≈ü (A Woman, A Period: Suat Dervi≈ü) by Jewish-origin Turkish author, Liz Behmoaras.

It was written and directed by John Ridley and stars Idris Elba, Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay in leading roles. Guerrilla debuted on Sky Atlantic on 13 April 2017 and on Showtime on 16 April 2017. Plot A love story set against the backdrop of one of the most politically explosive times in UK history. A politically active couple (played by Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay) have their relationship and values tested, when they liberate a political prisoner and form a radical underground cell in 1970s London.

Howe and Dhondy were consultants for the show, while Dhondy was also asked to be a script editor. Ridley also consulted other BBP members, including Neil Kenlock and Leila Hassan. The character Jas Mitra, played by Freida Pinto, was inspired by BBP member Mala Sen, another member of the Race Today Collective. Five episodes were written by John Ridley, who also directed the first two episodes and the finale. Misan Sagay wrote the fifth episode, with Sam Miller directing the other episodes. Episodes Broadcast Guerilla premiered 13 April 2017 on Sky Atlantic in the United Kingdom and 16 April 2017 on cable network Showtime in United States. Reception The show has received positive reviews, with a \\"fresh\\" 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a \\"generally favorable\\" 76% rating on Metacritic. Controversy The mini-series has been criticised for excluding the historical role played by black women who were part of the British Black Panthers (BBP) organization. There has been debate about erasure of black women, since none of the lead characters are black women and the female lead is played by an Indian woman. The most prominent black woman in the first episode is working to support racism. Several former BBP members have responded to the controversy including, Neil Kenlock, Farrukh Dhondy, and Elizabeth Obi. All three have defended Pinto's casting and the role of Asians in the movement as historically appropriate, However, Obi also criticised the absence of black women in leading roles, as well as the representation of black women in the first episode. Writing for The Guardian, Obi said: \\"I was there, and I find the portrayal of black women unforgivable\\". Obi was supportive Pinto casting as Jas Mitra stating that her character \\"is quite obviously in recognition of Mala Sen, who was part of the leadership of the Black Panther movement....For me it was an absolute pleasure to have Mala's contribution acknowledged through the role of Jas.\\" Obi goes on to say that \\"the portrayal of black women in the first episode was unforgivable, as they are represented solely by Wunmi Mosaku‚Äôs character Kenya, a sex worker whose clients include the police inspector Pence.\\" Later Obi states: \\"It is impossible to watch Guerrilla without noticing the gaping hole it leaves in the story of the struggle for racial justice. Black women ‚Äì including Althea Jones-Lecointe, Olive Morris and Gail Lewis ‚Äì weren‚Äôt just part of the history of the black power movement, they led it in Britain.\\" On the other hand, while at a screening Kenlock stated: \\"I'm the only person here who was part of the movement and John has got it spot on. Mala Sen, an Asian woman, was extremely active.\\" Dhondy noted that the BBP began in the late 1960s by a collective of black and Asian activists working together under the banner of \\"blackness\\", with \\"Black\\" as a political label for all people of colour. He wrote that, along with black women such as Altheia Jones, Asian men and women, such as himself and Sen, were also prominent in the movement. He also noted that, along with the lack of a black female lead, the series also lacks an Asian male lead, despite Asian men such as himself, Sunit Chopra and Vivan Sundaram being prominent BBP members. According to Dhondy, at least 20 Asian women held leadership positions in the British black power movement, including founders of the Southall Black Sisters and the Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent.Cawthorne, Ellie, \\"'Guerrilla' and the real history of British Black Power\\", BBC History, 13 April 2017.

Known as the \\"Hiroshige of the Taisho Era,\\" Yoshida created over 3000 maps in his lifetime.  Biography  Yoshida was born in Kyoto in 1884 as Hatsusaburo Izumi. His father died when he was a year old, so he adopted his mother's surname. At age 10, Yoshida became a textile designer apprentice, making y≈´zen for kimonos. When he turned 25, he studied foreign painting with Masaro Kagiki, but turned to commercial art at Kagiki's recommendation. In 1914, his first bird's-eye view \\"Keihan Train Guide\\" was praised by Emperor Showa (then Crown Prince), who was aboard the Keihan Train on a school trip. The popularity of Hatsushiro's birds-eye view maps increased due to the tourism boom in Japan from Taisho to Showa era. Yoshida established the Taish≈ç meisho zue-sha (Taisho famous places' illustration company), which was later renamed Kank≈ç-sha (Tourism company). Yoshida visited the places which he depicted on maps, talking to people and studying popular attractions. In 1921, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the introduction of rail transport in Japan, the Ministry of Railways decided to publish \\"Railway Travel Information\\" guides with maps illustrated by Yoshida. He also made posters for the International Tourism Bureau's \\"Beautiful Japan\\" campaign in the 1930s. Ise Meisho Zue, by Hatsusaburo Yoshida (1919) During that decade Yoshida was flooded with requests to create a bird's-eye maps from the whole country (including Manchuria and Taiwan). He hired disciples to help with his works, while moving his base to Inuyama City and Hachinohe City (Tanesashi Coast). He also received requests from many friends, like royalty such as Prince Takamatsu and soldiers such as Iwane Matsui. However, during World War II, Yoshida's map production slowed down; the military judged those maps would be inconvenient in that time, as they would potentially reveal military secrets, such as secret harbors, to the enemy. After the war Yoshida's first major work was a bird's-eye view of the aftermath of the Hiroshima atomic bombing. Yoshida died in 1955. In 1999, a retrospective exhibition about his maps was held at the Sakai City Museum.

Anne survived Petre by many years and (like him in his final years) was a covert Catholic; she lived on at Ingatestone Hall, and there received and sheltered many of the seminary priests, whose presence was strictly forbidden in England by Elizabeth's law at that time. Coming from Douai they were usually missionaries to the persecuted Catholics, but sometimes plotters against the Protestant Queen. One of these missionaries was John Payne, who lived for some time at Ingatestone Hall under her protection. He was arrested there in 1577, thrown into prison for three weeks, and then released. He returned to France by the end of the year, but it was not long before he was back in England and at Ingatestone Hall, where he passed as Lady Petre's steward and acted as her confessor. In 1581, information was laid against him, and he was arrested at Warwick and tried, not only for saying Mass, which was then a punishable offence, but also for plotting against Elizabeth. After long investigation, trial, and torture, he was executed in 1582 at Chelmsford. John Payne was nephew of Rector Woodward, of Ingatestone who had resigned rather than conform. Anne herself was on the list of recusants whose addresses were to be sent up in 1582. Payne's trial and execution seems to have been a severe blow to Anne, for she died in April of the same year and was buried with her second husband in the vault adjoining the chancel at St Edmund and St Mary's Church, Ingatestone, and her effigy lies by his on the tomb above. Lady Anne Petre, widow of Sir William Petre made a final will in February of the year in which she died, 1582.

The episode was written by series creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and was directed by Aaron Lipstadt. Plot Opening quote: \\"Maybe this world is another planet's hell.\\" The episode opens on Nick Burkhardt and Sean Renard in Nick's loft, the scene of the previous season finale's final battle in which major Black Claw figure Bonaparte was killed by Sean's sword. Nick tentatively thanks Sean, but Sean admits to being unsure of his contribution. He wonders how Nick can be alive in spite of being hit by bullets, and Nick says he's unsure. Sean departs, leaving his sword. Meanwhile, Monroe, Rosalee, Hank, Wu, Eve and Trubel are all still in the tunnel system accessed through the loft. Monroe and Rosalee are one of two groups separated in search for an exit. Rosalee brings up her pregnancy, and she and Monroe agree to not disclose it to anybody else. Both search parties return, and Nick meets the scared group who expect an attacker and marvel at Nick's being alive. Sean meets Adalind at the mansion and tells her of Bonaparte's demise, mentioning he does not intend to confess his role and will instead blame Nick. He plays at Diana's possible involvement and also suggests Adalind will be sorry she fell in love with Nick. Adalind finds Diana in bed, and a doll and pin at the foot end, and Diana confirms that she played with her doll and did not want Bonaparte to ever hurt Adalind again. Having returned from the tunnels, Nick's group splits up to remove evidence of the fights at Nick's loft and Rosalee's shop. At the shop, one of the corpses grips Eve's arm, and she enters a trancelike state. Rosalee identifies this as the Death Grip, and on consulting a book hacks off the attacker's hand as a remedy. Eve then returns to consciousness. Rosalee mentions that the Death Grip can return a dead wesen to life if they offer up a pure soul as barter. The group wonders how Eve's soul can be pure. At the loft, Adalind calls Nick, asking him to see her and Kelly and he agrees. From the conversation with Adalind earlier, Nick goes to the Black Claw mansion to see Adalind. They kiss and reconcile. Nick gets to see Kelly and they talk about Diana. The meeting ends with a make-out session between her and Nick. Trubel notices she still has the cloth that the mysterious stick was wrapped in, and shows it to Eve, who is able to see patterns on it that Trubel cannot, and which match marks Eve saw on the dead wesen's face during her Death Grip trance. Meanwhile, Renard has obtained warrants for various premises and a shoot to kill order on Nick, and Hank and Wu relay inside police info to Nick, who has gone into hiding at Bud's place. At a meeting of Nick's group at Bud's, the group decides that Nick should leave Portland, and Eve explains to Nick that it might not be wise to use the stick continuously. As the episode closes, Nick and the group are still hiding at Bud's place, which is completely surrounded by heavily armed police.

Critical reviews \\"Fugitive\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Les Chappell gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"‚ÄúFugitive‚Äù doesn‚Äôt provide an answer to the question right away, but that‚Äôs not a big surprise since Grimm‚Äôs season premieres are rarely when the show puts its best foot/paw/wing forward. The show‚Äôs predilection for the explosive finale means they always begin a new year picking through the shrapnel, and ‚ÄúThe Beginning Of The End‚Äù left even more shrapnel than usual. The shattering of Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and Black Claw, Diana‚Äôs ability to kill off enemies with the power of her mind, and twin resurrections by the Splinter of Destiny are all big developments, and Team Grimm is battered around by all of them.

The towns of Moctezuma, La Junta, Casa Grande, San Clemente de Terapa, Tepache, El Llano and Divisaderos lie in the area. Volcanic activity in Mexico encompasses both oceanic and continental types of volcanic activity. Geographically, volcanism in Mexico is often subdivided into a Californian, Eastern Alcalic, Sierra Madre Occidental and Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with the addition of a fifth proposed in 2007, which is known as the Northern Mexico Extensional Province. The field is located in the Moctezuma basin, in central Sonora on the western foot of the Sierra Madre Occidental range. The ranges immediately east and west of the Moctezuma basin are known as Sierra La Madera and Sierra El Coyote, respectively. This is a sedimentary basin delimited by faults; the basin is part of the Basin and Range Province of the state of Sonora. The oldest rocks are of Cretaceous age and a number of fossils have been investigated there. Volcanic activity occurred early in the basin's history, with one old lava flow intercalated between sediments dated at 22.3 million years ago. The lithosphere in the region was thicker back then. Five pyroclastic cones are found in the field and are named Cerro el Barril (), high Cerro Blanco which is covered by lava bombs (), Cerro los Fierros (), Cerro Mogote de Corralles (), Cerro Villalobos () and Rancho la Poma (). These cones and associated lava flows cover a surface of about . The Rio Moctezuma and its tributary Rio Tepache flow through the area. Lava flows have repeatedly impounded the Moctezuma river and dammed it. Rocks erupted in the field are basaltic andesite and hawaiite. These rocks are mafic and often hypersthene, nepheline or quartz normative. Olivine forms phenocrysts. The total volume of the latest products is less than . There was a change in composition from tholeiite to alkali basalt over time, something observed in other volcanic centres of the Basin and Range Province as well. There is evidence that while older volcanism originated from lithospheric magma, more recent activity comes from asthenospheric magma. Moctezuma rocks noticeably lack xenoliths. In the Terapa area, vegetation is formed by thornscrub and climate data amounting to an average temperature of and average precipitation of have been computed. Early volcanism was tholeiitic and formed a mesa with columnar joints exposed in river valleys. These eruptions occurred along the faults which delimit the basin, one date obtained from them is 1.7 ¬± 0.74 million years ago. Pahoehoe lava and pillow lava has been found on these flows. The pyroclastic cones were formed during later alkali basalt volcanism. The youngest eruption occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming lava flows. Potassium- argon dating has yielded an age of 530,000 ¬± 200,000 years ago. This cone formed aa lava flows that generated the Mesa Grande malpais.

Description and history The River Road Covered Bridge is located in a rural area of central Troy, near the eastern end of Veilleux Road. It spans the Missisquoi in a roughly east‚Äìwest orientation, resting on abutments of stone and concrete. It is a single-span Town lattice truss, long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane). It is covered by a metal roof, and its exterior is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. The siding does not rise all the way to the roof, leaving an open strip between them. Unlike most Town lattice trusses, this one has three chords instead of four, and its joints are fastened with single pegs instead of doubled one. with The bridge was built in 1910; its builder is unknown. It is the only covered bridge in Troy. In addition to its unusual truss construction, the bridge also has an unusually broad roof, and has exterior timber buttressing not usually found on covered bridges.

The most common reason for using washed red blood cells in transfusion medicine is to prevent the recurrence of severe allergic transfusion reactions that do not respond to medical treatment. The usual cause of these allergic reactions is proteins in the donor plasma. These proteins are removed by the process of washing the red blood cells.  Methods of washing red cells  There are multiple methods of washing red cells. These can include automated or manual methods. They can use centrifugation or centrifugation-free methods. The red cells can be re-suspended in saline or other types of special preservative solutions for red cells e.g. SAG-M.  Medical Uses   Prevention of recurrence of severe allergic reactions  The most common reason for using washed red blood cells in transfusion medicine is to prevent the recurrence of severe allergic transfusion reactions. The allergen is usually a protein in the plasma that is removed by the process of washing the red blood cells. Various proteins, such as antibodies directed against IgA or haptoglobin in people with IgA and haptoglobin deficiency have been suggested to have a causal relationship with the allergic reaction. Cytokines and chemokines, which accumulate during the storage of blood components, have also been suggested as causative agents. However, the literature is scare and conflicting as passive infusion of anti- IgA antibodies in to recipients has not been found to cause an allergic reaction.  Reduction in transfusion-related complications  In neonates transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of serious side-effects including: * Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) * Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) * Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) * Chronic lung disease (CLD) * Death Transfusion-related immune modulation has been thought to be the underlying mechanism. Washing red cells has been thought to be one way of potentially decreasing the risk of theses transfusion-related side-effects. However, in neonates, there is insufficient evidence to say whether washing red cells has any effect.  Storage  Once red cells have been washed they can only be kept for up to a day.

Life Jiang Xu was from Tianshui Commandery (Â§©Ê∞¥ÈÉ°), which is around present-day Tianshui, Gansu. He was very close to his relative, Yang Fu, whom he grew up with. Yang Fu served as a subordinate of Wei Kang, the Inspector (Âà∫Âè≤) of Liang Province (covering parts of northwestern China).Sanguozhi vol. 25. In 211, a coalition of warlords from northwestern China, under the leadership of Ma Chao and Han Sui, started a rebellion in Liang Province against the Han central government, which was headed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao's forces defeated Ma Chao and the coalition at the Battle of Tong Pass. In the subsequent years, Ma Chao, with support from the Qiang tribes and the warlord Zhang Lu, constantly raided and attacked the lands in Liang Province. At the time, Wei Kang was stationed in Liang Province's capital, Ji (ÂÖæ; also called Jicheng, in present-day Gangu County, Gansu), which came under siege by Ma Chao. As the siege dragged on, Wei Kang took pity on the plight of the defenders and civilian population, so in 213 he surrendered to Ma Chao ‚Äì against the advice of Zhao Ang, Yang Fu and his other subordinates. After taking over the city, Ma Chao killed Wei Kang, seized control of Liang Province, and forced Wei Kang's subordinates to submit to him. At the time, Jiang Xu held the appointment General Who Pacifies the Barbarians (Êí´Â§∑Â∞áËªç) and was stationed in the county of Li (Ê≠∑; also called Licheng, within present-day Tianshui, Gansu). Yang Fu secretly harboured the intention of avenging Wei Kang, so when his wife died, he used her death as an excuse to take leave from work. He then visited Jiang Xu and his mother in Li county. During the visit, Yang Fu lamented about how Ma Chao had committed atrocities and occupied Liang Province illegitimately, and expressed his desire to get rid of Ma Chao.

In late 213, Jiang Xu and Yang Fu started a rebellion against Ma Chao in another county, Lu (Èπµ; also called Lucheng, in present-day southeastern Gansu). At the same time, Zhao Qu and the others who were with Ma Chao in Ji City pretended to urge Ma Chao to suppress the rebellion. Ma Chao then led troops from Ji City to attack Lu County in an attempt to suppress the revolt. After failing to retake Lu County, Ma Chao decided to return to Ji City. However, while he was away, Zhao Qu, Liang Kuan and the others had seized control of Ji City and killed his wife and child(ren). In anger, Ma Chao led his forces to attack Li County, where Jiang Xu's family members were. The defenders at Li County heard that Ma Chao had fled to Hanzhong Commandery after his defeat so they lowered their guard. They mistook Ma Chao for Jiang Xu, and unsuspectingly allowed him to enter. Ma Chao occupied Li County by force and captured Jiang Xu's mother and son.

Built between 1886 and 1888 by John Plankinton for his daughter as a wedding gift, it cost at least $100,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Architect Edward Townsend Mix designed the house in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. It was located opposite John Plankinton's own house on Grand Avenue in an upscale residential area of the western part of the city, near other mansions. Mrs. Margaret Johnston was the only person to have a permanent residence in the house (1896‚Äì1904). The Knights of Columbus used the property between 1910 and 1978. Despite being listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, the house was demolished on October 11, 1980, to make way for student facilities for Marquette University. The facility ultimately built was the Marquette Alumni Memorial Union. It is extremely close to the site of the house, but the majority of the land occupied by the house remains a grass lawn in 2020.  Construction  The three-bedroom house was located at 1432 Grand Avenue, later known as 1492 West Wisconsin Avenue (north side between 14th Street and 15th Street), in Milwaukee. The Knights of Columbus had the house number changed from \\"1432\\" to the more historic (and Columbus-related) \\"1492\\" date, and it was also referred to as the \\"Knights of Columbus Building\\". Local historians H. Russell Zimmermann and Mary Ellen Young attribute the house as being designed by Edward Townsend Mix. It was a three-story stone structure with an attic and basement. According to the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) done in 1980 by the United States Department of the Interior, the house was constructed between 1886, when ownership was transferred to Elizabeth, and 1888, when it appears in Rascher's Fire Insurance Atlas of City of Milwaukee. Zimmerman notes that an inscription dated 1887 was discovered on a piece of roofing slate in 1979, and suggests that the house was likely finished in that year; Reports of the costs of construction vary from $100,000 to $150,000 (equivalent to $ to $ million in ). The basic building was square and had three projecting bays. The front of the house had a three-story conical turret, a stone porch, a porte-cochere, and a sunroom on the west side. The width was around 50 feet overall, depending on the section of the house measured. The depth of the house was about 70 feet, depending on which part. The exterior walls were of Cream City brick from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. It was trimmed with carved buff ashlar sandstone, granite columns, terracotta tiles, and metal work. The main entrance facing south had a one-and-a-half- story entrance porch with arches. The house roof had red clay tiles. On the east side of the house was a porte-cochere, a protruding exterior part with a round arched opening and a flat roof for a weather-protected side entrance. This entrance had granite columns with leafed plants growing all around them. According to Zimmermann, the Plankinton mansion was exceptional in that \\"almost the entire project is designed and drawn by an architect [which] shows in the way all of the components of a given room are compatibly related to the whole.\\" The amount of money spent was reflected in the craftsmanship, which he illustrates with a first-floor fireplace: The HABS report notes that a skylight was removed in 1976 and sold, but that it was in size and had a mosaic design of 25,000 parts of zinc-framed stained glass pieces lined with copper. In line with John Plankinton's philosophy and to prove the capabilities of local workers, he ensured that \\"every part of it was made and prepared in Milwaukee by Milwaukee men,\\" as was reported in John's 1891 obituary in the Milwaukee Sentinel.  History  The Elizabeth Plankinton House was a mansion in Milwaukee built in 1886 as a wedding gift to Elizabeth from her father, businessman John Plankinton, known as \\"A Merchant Prince and Princely Merchant\\" for his philanthropy. The house was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. It was one of many such mansions owned by the wealthy in the west part of Milwaukee in the late 19th century. It was in the residential area on Grand Avenue (later Wisconsin Avenue) in the downtown district of the city. Elizabeth was abandoned by her fianc√©, sculptor Richard Hamilton Park, when he married a dancer from Minneapolis on September 18, 1887.Record #175 in marriages in the County of Ottawa, Michigan She was so distraught that she turned down the wedding gift and never lived in the house. She never married, and died in 1923. The stone structure was not occupied for almost 10 years. In 1896, Mrs. Margaret Johnston, a widow, bought the house to live in, and it passed on to her family upon her death in 1904. They sold it in 1910 to the local Knights of Columbus, who used it as their local city facility. In 1915 they erected a two-story rear addition that was 93 feet wide by 144 feet deep and was used as an auditorium and gymnasium. They used the main house as their headquarters from about 1919 to 1978. However, ownership was acquired in 1967 by the Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority, and they passed it to Marquette University in 1975. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Representatives of Marquette University argued that the \\"Knights of Columbus mansion is neither historical nor architecturally significant. It is the product of the whims of the owner and the architect, and does not represent a true example of any particular style of architecture\\" and that \\"to offer an eyesore like the Knights of Columbus building as an example of our great architectural tradition will make Milwaukee the laughing stock of the nation. . . . This mansion has no significant historical value . . . [and is] a monument to Victorian bad taste.\\" Zimmermann offered a strong defense of the building in a 1979 article in Milwaukee, the Metropolitan Magazine, arguing it was \\"Milwaukee's finest residential example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style\\", designed by \\"the area's most prominent 19th century architect,\\" and was still in \\"relatively fine original condition\\". On the point of its condition at that time, the HABS report described it as having a pristine exterior and an intact interior. Zimmermann concluded: By 1980, the House was entirely surrounded by other buildings of the university. Marquette had it demolished on October 11, 1980, approximately two months after the HABS survey report was issued, and despite its 1976 inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Its destruction led to the formation of the City of Milwaukee Historic Preservation Commission in 1981, with the aim of protecting Milwaukee's architectural heritage.

It is one of fourteen museums of the National Foundation of Museums of Morocco. The museum curates modern and contemporary Moroccan and international art. The MMVI is the first large scale museum built in Morocco since independence from France in 1956. It was the first Moroccan public museum to meet International Museography Standards. The museum houses the works of 200 Moroccan artists, including Hassan Hajjaj and Ahmed Yacoubi. Background The museum was founded in 2014 by Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, in Rabat. The museum was created to preserve and disseminate to the public the heritage of Moroccan art and encourage the creativity of Moroccan artists. It forms part of a wider Moroccan cultural infrastructure including the National Library of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Mohammed V National Theatre. Rabat was chosen for the location of the museum because it is the capital of Morocco; it is a Unesco World Heritage Site (2012) and is a popular tourist destination. The inaugural exhibition was entitled \\"1914 2014: 100 Years of Creation\\". Mission The museum curates Moroccan artistic creation in the plastic and visual arts from the beginning of the 20th century onwards. The museum values modern and contemporary Moroccan culture as well as Moroccan artistic and cultural heritage and makes it accessible to the public. This involves referencing, researching, conserving and promoting the art of Morocco. The museum introduces art to young people, promotes artworks by young people and teaches respect for art. It also teaches history of art and assists scientific research in the artistic field. Architecture The museum took ten years to build in central Rabat. The museum's architecture incorporates features of Rabat's identity and urbanism; Morocco's cultural diversity; the harmony of Morocco's secular heritage and reworked traditional motifs. The architecture links past to present with Arab-Moorish inspiration in a modern building. However, the design is also a statement of the will to continue in Morocco a well-established tradition of modernity. The arcades The outermost fa√ßade, called the \\"architectural skin\\", is of Arab-Moorish inspiration. It is white with a colonnade of double arches. The cloisters have a motif called \\"Keef was Darja\\". The double arches project shadows onto the building according to the light and the seasons. The museum is most easily recognised by the arches. Chromatic facade A chromatic fa√ßade invites the public to events and exhibitions at the museum. It displays large reproductions of works by Chaibia, Hassan El Glaoui, Mohamed Kacimi, Gharbaoui and Melehi. The largest displays are by . In the evenings, colourful lights are projected onto the building. Visual axes The museum has two clear lines of sight, each commencing with an entrance. The east west axis is lit by sunsets at the winter solstice. Where the clear lines of sight cross, there is a patio atrium for events and temporary exhibitions surrounded by a tea room, bookshop, educational workshops and an auditorium. Interior The interior spaces are defined by variations in height, from single to triple. Natural light also helps define the spaces. Floors The floors of the halls, corridors and stairs are decorated with traditionally inspired grand abstract patterns. The patterns give an intuitive signage allowing visitors to understand the building's geometric design. Ornaments The main theme of the building is a stylized motif. It is worked in a variety of ways such as laser cutting, cast plaster, and chiselled nickel silver. There is a polished stainless steel laser-cut frieze and a similar design made in moulded plaster decorating the light wells. The columns of the atrium are dressed in nickel silver with hand-carved motifs by the artisans of Fez.

Construction of the temple was carried out at the expense of merchants Gerasimov, Myasnikov and Safonov. The project was drafted by architect Grigory Vasilyev. The main altar was consecrated in honor of the Ascension of the Lord. Side chapels ‚Äï in honor of saints Adrian and Natalia, and in honor of St. John the Evangelist. The church has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional significance.  History  In 1892, after a cholera epidemic outbreak outside the city, there had been established a cemetery, which was named Brethren Cemetery (–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ). Back then it was the largest cemetery in Rostov-on-Don, yet for some time it hadn't even had a chapel. From 1891 to 1908 at the New Market Square there had been being built the Alexander Nevsky's Cathedral. During this period, there had been constructed a temporal stone church, based on Sergei Zagoskin's project. After the consecration of the cathedral, it was decided not to demolish the church completely, but to disassemble and transport building material to the Brethren Cemetery for the construction of a new church there. Transportation was implemented at the expense of merchants Gerasimov, Myasnikov and Safonov. Construction works were carried out under the direction of the city architect G.N. Vasilyev. The temple architecture had neo-Byzantine and Russian Revival features. Initially, the temple had a great chapter and four small cupolas. Dacades were decorated with brick veneer. Above the western entrance rose a belfry. In 1929 the church was closed. \\"Dinamo\\" sport stadium used its premises as a warehouse. In 1933, after an appeal to the authorities of the Assumption community in the church was opened again, only to be re-closed again in 1937. In 1930-1940-ies bell tower and dome of the temple were destroyed. In 1942, during the times of German occupation, the church was re-opened. The official opening of the church took place in 1946, and since then the services have not stopped. In the late 1990s, restoration works were conducted, during which the bell tower and the dome were restored. In the second half of the 2000s there was carried out reconstruction of church interior.

Saturday, 27.09.1919 Page: 2 Biography Early life The second of four sons to Sir James Gell and Amelia Marcia Gell (n√©e Gill), James Stowell Gell was born in Castletown, Isle of Man on Friday 20 April 1855. Like his father before him, James Gell was educated at King William's College, Castletown, Isle of Man and on completion of his education he entered as student-at-law with the object of being admitted to the Manx Bar. Career Articled to the law firm of his father, who was then Her Majesty's Attorney General of the Isle of Man, he qualified in 1878. He at once entered into partnership with his father, Sir James, the firm being known as Gell and Gell and having an extensive family and court practice. He remained in association with his father as a practicing advocate until 1897, when Sir James Gell was appointed First Deemster. During an illness which affected his father during the 1890s, he acted as Attorney General, and in such capacity it fell on him to lead for the Crown in the prosecution of George Cooper on a charge of having murdered his wife at the Regent Hotel, Douglas. His junior on the occasion was James Murray Cruikshank High Bailiff of Ramsey. On 5 May 1892 Gell was appointed High Bailiff of Castletown in succession to John Jeffcott, and on 8 August 1905, on the resignation of Samuel Harris, Gell was appointed High Bailiff for Douglas. It was said of him that he discharged his magisterial duties with great acceptance and with conspicuous fairness. As High Bailiff he was ex-officio chairman of the Licensing Courts for the districts of Castletown and Douglas. During the period following the death of Clerk of the Rolls, Thomas Kneen, and the appointment of Sir William Kyffin Taylor as special Judge of Appeal in the Isle of Man, Gell acted as a member of the Court of Staff of Government, and as such he sat during several cases of appeal from decisions of the Common Law Division of the High Court. Personal life On 25 August 1887 Gell married Emily Bainton, the youngest daughter of William Bainton of Beverley Park, Beverley, Yorkshire. The marriage produced one son, James Bainton Stowell Gell, who was drafted overseas in August 1918 and killed in action on 9 October 1918, aged 19. Regarded as a proud Castletonian, Gell assisted in the development of Castletown and from the time he was a young man he took a leading part in Castletown public affairs. Said to have been a highly charitable person, together with his wife Gell worked to provide assistance to the poor members of the community. Although a man of strong conviction, Gell never failed to accept the right of one person to differ from another, even when the difference was with himself. A communicant of the Established Church, like his father before him, Gell championed liberty of religious conscience for all. Death The death of his son was said to of affected Gell very deeply. In the early spring of 1919, he contracted a virus and gradually started to become weaker, although he continued to attend to his office. His condition worsened, and from early May he was confined to his house. Gell died at this home, Westwood, The Crofts, Castletown, on 23 September 1919. He was survived by his wife. Funeral Gell's funeral took place on Friday 26 September. Those in attendance included the Chief Constable of the Isle of Man, Colonel Madoc; members of the Bar; Sir Hall Caine; the Vicar General of the Isle of Man and all Justices of the Peace. Following the service James Gell's body was interred in the family vault in Malew Parish Churchyard.

It is also known as cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). Alzheimer's disease and dementia in humans are diseases with comparable symptoms and pathology. Causes The exact cause of FCD is currently unknown. Genetic factors may predispose an animal to the condition. Signs of cognitive dysfunction may be connected with a prosencephalon or cerebrum problem. Symptoms Older cats display more symptoms of the disease than younger cats. Behavioural symptoms usually become apparent in cats older than 10 years. Main signs of FCD can be summarized with the acronym DISH: *Disorientation, * reduced social Interactions, *Changes in Sleep patterns, * loss of Housetraining skills. Affected cats may wander aimlessly and look lost in space, seem restless and anxious, fail to recognize familiar faces such as their owners, caretakers or other cats in the clowder, display decreased interest in social interactions or increased aggression, experience insomnia, sometimes along with increased nocturnal vocalizations with no apparent reason.  Other conditions with similar symptoms  Signs of FCD can be found in a number of other pathologies such as brain tumors or non brain-related diseases, which makes it important to exclude the possibility of other causes. For example, excessive urination may signify a kidney disease, and the look of numbness and detachment may be caused by a large variety of conditions, from pain to affected vision. Arthritis may hinder a cat's ability to get into the litter box in time. Night-time vocalizing is relatively common in hyperthyroid cats or cats with hypertension, which can also cause retinal detachment and blindness, leading to anxiety and confusion. Progressively painful periodontal disease can discourage the cat from visiting its food bowl with the same enthusiasm it showed at a younger age. If all other possible diseases are excluded, and MRI and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid fail to reveal a physical problem in the brain, then the problem may be treated by an animal behaviorist or veterinary psychiatrist.  Prevention  As the cause of the disease is unknown, there is no way to be certain in prevention of the condition. However, the following measures are considered effective: * absence of other animals in the house whose presence may be stressful to the cat, * vitamin E-rich diet, * conveniently accessible litter boxes, * ramps for the stairs if the cat experiences difficulties going up and down, * routine checkups with a veterinarian to detect a disease on early stage. Treatment The disease is little-researched and thus considered incurable at the moment, but its symptoms can be managed with treatment. Cognitive dysfunction syndrome in dogs is an established diagnosis, but there has been limited research for cats and treatment options are limited. Drugs used for treatment of the disease have been approved for use in dogs. However, they are used off-label in treatment of cats. Early diagnosis improves results of long-term treatment. Improving home environment may help in managing the disease. The treatment must always be arranged with a veterinarian for each particular animal, but the suggested measures include the following (veterinarian's advice is needed for right dosage of any supplements): * species-appropriate diet rich in omega-3, * physical and mental exercise, such as treat-release toys, * S-adenosylmethionine supplement, * medium-chain triglycerides (can improve brain energy metabolism and decrease the amyloid protein buildup that results in brain lesions in older pets), * antioxidants, such as resveratrol (Japanese knotweed), which protects against free radical damage and beta-amyloid deposits, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), phosphatidylserine and apoaequorin, * vitamins E, C and B complex, * melatonin as a sedation for nocturnal vocalizations and insomnia, As the disease progresses, it gradually gets more difficult to ease, which increases the importance of detecting the diseases on the earliest possible stage. Recommendations include limiting the access to the parts of the house that may present danger to the animal, set a consistent schedule for feeding, playing and interacting with the cat, \\"talking\\" with the animal and calling it by the name so that the familiar voice soothes it, and adding more litterboxes in case the cat experiences excessive urination or defecation.

The line-up went through several line-ups including founding members Tim Kerr (guitar), and Chris Loughridge (drums) before stabilising as a four piece with drummer Paul Kelly, formerly of The Lids .  History  Taking as inspiration bands such as The Ramones, the band started to play at Belfast punk venue The Harp Bar and were picked up by local impresario and label-owner Terri Hooley. Hooley had them record two tracks, Belfast Telegraph and I Like It Like That for a proposed 7' single release on his Good Vibrations label but which, due to financial pressures on the label's budget, did not appear. (Good Vibrations later added both sides of the aborted Shock Treatment single to the track listing for the compilation album Ulster on a Thin Wire scheduled in 1980 but also aborted.) Belfast Telegraph eventually surfaced in 1980 on the Room To Move EP featuring fellow Belfast bands The Outcasts, Big Self and Dublin band The Vipers. Shock Treatment became a popular live act, for a period hosting their own venue at the Bailey Bar in Belfast and playing all of the venues associated with that city's 'punk explosion' in the late seventies. They set up their own Maximum Beat and Evenings and Weekends tours with fellow Belfast band Lovers of Today, playing widely on both sides of the border in Ireland. Now very popular on the North West circuit of clubs, pubs and surfing venues alongside regular touring partners Guilty Achievements Shock Treatment's status ensured that they began appearing at the province's larger venues in Belfast, including support slots at The Ulster Hall to visiting acts including The Skids, U2 and Psychedelic Furs. Their second release came on the D.A.B. Record label set up by the band's management Davy and Alan Brown. Big Check Shirts c/w Mystery Man received airplay on national radio in Ireland and the UK.  Dissolution and rebirth  The departure in 1982 of vocalist Barry McIlheney to what would become a successful career in music journalism brought an end to the band. McIlheney wrote for and edited Melody Maker and Smash Hits among others, later founding Empire magazine and moving further into publishing. Guitarist Davy McLarnon then formed a songwriting partnership with the bassist of similarly- defunct Guilty Achievements. This led to their formation of the band Five Boys (1983‚Äì86), later Big Electric PLC (1986‚Äì88), for which they wrote and performed material before McLarnon joined Peace Frog in the 90's. In 2011, this songwriting partnership recorded or re-recorded Shock Treatment and Five Boys songs for a studio project. These tracks were released in 2014 on the debut album by Shock Treatment 21, a fresh incarnation of the band with McLarnon as sole original member alongside John Rossi and Keith McVeigh from his subsequent band, Peace Frog. Reviving the Shock Treatment fan-base and interest in the earlier band's legacy, Shock Treatment 21 has since become one of Northern Ireland's popular live acts, sharing bills with the likes of 999, The Lurkers, John Otway and Alabama 3. A new single and second album from the band are scheduled in 2017 on punk label Spit Records.  Discography  * 1980 Room To Move 7\\" EP (feat.

Service and rebuilding  When and If remained in the harbor at Manchester-by-the-Sea in Massachusetts and was passed successively from Patton's wife to her brother Frederick Ayer and then on to his son. Frederick Ayer Jr. donated it to the Landmark School in Beverly, MA in 1972, where she was used for sail training programs for children with dyslexia. Due to financial difficulties, arrangements were made share ownership with Jim and Gina Mairs. However, in 1990 she broke loose in a gale and was wrecked. Assessed as a total loss, she was successfully salvaged and towed to the Gannon & Benjamin shipyard in Martha's Vineyard. Describing the state of the yacht Jill Bobrow wrote: > There was a huge gaping hole in her port side, broken frames, twisted cabin > sole, thoroughly demolished interior, destroyed rudder, smashed keel ‚Äì > problems galore. After a three-year rebuilding process, she was re-launched in 1994. Her deck and transom were rebuilt in upstate New York in 2012; since then she has been actively sailing the East Coast of the United States. Purchased by Captain Seth Salzmann in 2015, she has been a part of Tall Ships Festivals in both 2015 and 2016, and in 2017 When and If sailed with Sail Training International to Bermuda, Boston and on to all corners of the Canadian Maritimes. Her home port in the winter is now Key West, where she offers public and private charters.  Specifications  As of 2008, When and If was outfitted with a Lugger 110 HP diesel engine. Amenities included a Tasco propane stove, Sea Frost engine driven ice box, and a Double SS sink. The ship's sails were replaced with a new outfit by Sperry in 2010, with a total area of 1,770 square feet for the four lower sails.

He was the first Italian gallery owner to turn his gallery, dirartecontemporanea, into a virtual exhibition space (dirartecontemporanea 2.0).  Biography  Angelo Marino was born in Frattaminore. In 1991 he founded the gallery dirartecontemporanea in Caserta. In 2001 he organized a group of seminars at the Belvedere San Leucio Caserta, Scavare il futuro: nuovi spazi antichi, in collaboration with Elmar Zorn and City of Caserta. In the same year he collaborated to the installation of the exhibition Plus Ultra at the Royal Palace of Caserta. In 2003 he curated Un anfiteatro per la Pace: stendardi d'artista, an exhibition featuring the work of Carla Accardi, Arcangelo, Angelo Bellobono, Elisabetta Benassi, Dafni & Papadatos, Gianni Dessi, Francesco Impellizzeri, Jannis Kounellis, H.H. Lim, Mafonso, Luigi Mainolfi, Fabio Mauri, Sukran Moral, Hidetoshi Nagasawa, Luigi Ontani and Giacomo Zaza in Piazza Dante in Caserta. In 2005 he organised Il senso del male, an exhibition conceived as a reflection on the tense political climate following 9/11 questioning the meaning of evil at Chiostro di S. Agostino in Caserta. In 2012 Marino converted dirartecontemporanea into a virtual gallery where artists were invited to create works specifically in a web-related context. His idea was to propose a new way to experience contemporary art, without geographical and temporal boundaries. The first exhibition was Max Coppeta: visioni transitorie. Works 2001.2012. In 2013 the project was expanded to the Independent Web-Pavilion of the Indigenous Tribes of the Amazon Basin, a tribute to the tribes of native tribes from the Amazon forest still unaffected by Globalisation. This was followed by the 2nd Independent Web Pavilion: Humanity, Betrayed & Traitors. In 2016 he created the D2.0-box, an exhibition space where a large screen would enable the audience to meet and discuss online exhibitions. Marino was also a friend and mentor of many artists from the Campania region, including Antonio Biasiucci, Nino Longobardi, Mafonso, Piero Chiariello, Arturo Casanova, Luigi Auriemma, Bruno Fermariello, Gloria Pastore and Mariano Filippetta. In 2016 he celebrated this connection in the exhibition Friends Marino died on October 10, 2018.  Exhibitions  * Max Coppeta: visioni transitorie.

Catamaran with full-length battens on the mainsail. A sail batten is a flexible insert in a sail, parallel to the direction of wind flow, that helps shape its qualities as an airfoil. Battens are long, thin strips of material, historically wooden but today usually fiberglass, vinyl, or carbon fiber, used to support the roach of a sail. They are also used on tall ships to form the ladders up the shrouds in a fashion similar to ratlines. History A junk is an ancient Chinese sailing ship design that is still in use today. Junks were used as seagoing vessels as early as the 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Their rigs featured full-length battens that facilitated short-handed sail handling, including reefing. Applications in sails The most common use of sail battens is in the roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have full-length battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Batten length near the head of the sail is limited by the need for the roach to pass ahead of the backstay, when tacking or jibing. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Batten materials and construction Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section. An alternative shape is a hollow tube that rotates in the batten pocket and is more compatible with roller furling the mainsail. Because the ends of battens are likely to chafe the sail at the ends of the pockets into which they are inserted, they often have a soft, blunt shape affixed to them.

Though most popular for her work in comedy, she also excelled in dramatic roles. Often referred to as the \\"Serbian Sarah Bernhardt\\" and \\"Great ≈Ωanka\\", she is considered by critics and many of her peers as the greatest Serbian actress of all time. Early life Born ≈Ωivana Stokiƒá in Veliko Gradi≈°te in eastern Serbia on 24 January 1887, her baker turned police clerk father Bogosav died when ≈Ωivana was still an infant. Her mother Julka then remarried ‚Äî to a widowed priest Aleksandar \\"Sanda\\" Nikolajeviƒá ‚Äî and moved to the village of Rabrovo (modern municipality of Kuƒçevo). As a result, Rabrovo had been reported as ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá's birthplace for decades until recently discovered data showed otherwise. The youngster didn‚Äôt get along with her stepfather, deciding at the age of 14 to run away from home to Zajeƒçar where she married a local tailor. The marital union was not a happy one, and within a year in 1902, teenage ≈Ωanka ran away from her husband, too ‚Äî this time by joining a travelling acting troupe. Career Early works Stokiƒá's first acting mentor was Ljubomir \\"ƒåvrga\\" Rajiƒçiƒá, head of the company of travelling actors she ran away from her husband with. Originally, she did errands as a washerwoman for the troupe. In her first role, Tereza in Braƒçne noƒái in 1902, she became a local sensation. ƒåvrga's troupe soon split, and ≈Ωanka joined several former colleagues on a tour of Vojvodina, Bosnia, and Croatia ‚Äî border areas of the neighbouring Austria-Hungary where Serbian is spoken. She then acted in the companies of Mika Bakiƒá, Dimitrije Ne≈°iƒá, and Mihailo \\"Era\\" Ratkoviƒá. In 1907 in Vara≈ædin she got her first dramatic role, a widow in Nada. That same year she became a member of the Osijek Theatre where she was noticed by the theatrologist Branko Gavella. On a guest tour to Belgrade in 1911, twenty-three-year-old Stokiƒá left an impression on Milan Grol, literary critic and chief of the National Theatre in Belgrade, who offered her a job. National Theatre Originally a temp, she soon became a full member of the company, appearing in over 100 starring and supporting roles during her career. Gavella personally directed her in Beaumarchais‚Äôs The Marriage of Figaro (as Suzanne), Edmond Rostand‚Äôs Cyrano de Bergerac and Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá‚Äôs Rodoljupci. Other roles include: Dorine (Tartuffe by Moli√®re), Madame Sans-G√™ne (by Victorien Sardou), Katyusha (Resurrection by Leo Tolstoy), Mrs. Warren (Mrs. Warren's Profession by George Bernard Shaw) and was especially successful as Toinette in Moli√®re's The Imaginary Invalid. In national repertoire she distinguished herself in the roles of Fema (Pokondirena tikva, by Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá), Sultanija/Pela (Zla ≈æena, also by Sterija), Nera (The Hoax, by Milovan Gli≈°iƒá), Emina (Zulumƒáar, by Svetozar ƒÜoroviƒá), Ru≈°ka (by Petar Petroviƒá Pecija) and Jela (U zati≈°ju, by Uro≈° S. Dojƒçinoviƒá). ≈Ωanka's broadest popularity, however, rested on her roles in the works of one of the greatest Serbian playwrights, Branislav Nu≈°iƒá. They include Innkeeper Janja (in Foundling), Sarka (Bereaved Family), Mrs. Spasiƒá (SYEW ‚Äì Society of Yugoslav Emancipated Women), Juli≈°ka (Travel Around the World), Mica (Authority), but above everything, ≈Ωivka in The Cabinet Minister‚Äôs Wife. Written by Nu≈°iƒá specifically for her, and premiering on May 25, 1929, under the direction of Vitomir Bogiƒá, it was a pinnacle of her career which acquired her the nicknames of Great ≈Ωanka and the greatest Serbian actress. Until 1941, the play had over 200 performances, with guest performances in theatres in Vienna, Prague, Sofia, Warsaw, Krakow and Vilnius. She made one motion picture, Gre≈°nica bez greha (Sinner without a sin), in 1927, directed by Kosta Novakoviƒá and co-starring Viktor Starƒçiƒá. Personal life After running away from her first husband in 1902, he found her, and with beatings and physical force, took her back to his home. She ran away again. This time members of the troop stood in her defense, and she remained in the company. Well known actor Aleksandar Aca Gavriloviƒá was especially protective of her and soon became her great love Their romance later ended when Gavriloviƒá left her for an actress Mica Hrvojiƒá. She married a second time in 1908, but the marriage was also short ending on a painful note. In 1939, she began a relationship with a clerk, Moris Pijade, some 20 years her younger. However, after German occupation of Serbia in 1941, as a Jew, Pijade was deported, apparently to the concentration camps of Sajmi≈°te and Dachau, and perished, despite her urging to Bo≈æidar Beƒáareviƒá, one of the heads of the Belgrade police, to spare him. Ultimately unhappy in her private life, she reclused to her house in Belgrade's neighborhood of Topƒçidersko Brdo, as a severe diabetic, living with her pets and a longtime maid and confidant, Magda. Personality and public image Though successful in dramatic roles, as well as in foreign stage productions where Stokiƒá specifically excelled in soubrette roles, her highest artistic achievement occurred in character comedy with her irresistibly suggestive acting that included spontaneity, freshness of expression, vivid imagination, exuberant temperament, and dynamic spirit. She was equally jovial in her private life and could be seen out and about living a bohemian life in Belgrade's kafanas, fraternizing with her, equally bohemian, male peers like ƒåiƒça Ilija Stanojeviƒá and Milan Gavriloviƒá. When she organized a celebration of her 25 years of acting in Belgrade's bohemian quarter Skadarlija, fans from far and wide showed up, giving her presents that included cash, sacks full of coins, puppies in flower baskets, and war bonds. It is known that, even though she would not get a new role for over a year, she never complained. Publicity stunts include ≈Ωanka being a godmother to bear cubs at Belgrade Zoo. World War II Stokiƒá spent the war years depressed by illness and difficulty of acquiring insulin. She continued to act, appearing in comedy theatres Veseljaci and Centrala za humor, often playing a caricatured Pela the Washerwoman, a simple-hearted, blabby everyday woman. She was also active on Radio Belgrade in shows Veselo srpsko popodne and ≈†areno popodne, which were aired after the news and public announcements of the German city commandant. All those shows were, more-or-less, sponsored by Germans, to keep an appearance of normal life in occupied Belgrade. 1945 trial  After Germans were expelled and Belgrade was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans and Red Army on October 20, 1944, new Communist authorities immediately started organizing trials for collaborators and ≈Ωanka got arrested. On February 3, 1945, in a humiliating revolutionary trial with a group of prostitutes, and being denied a lawyer, even a public defender, the Court for the crimes and violations against the national honor found her guilty for collaborationism with the occupational forces. Her punishment included 8 years of loss of national honor and community service, specifically, street sweeping. It is believed that due to the intervention of Mitra Mitroviƒá, at the time wife of Milovan ƒêilas and a severe diabetic seizure during the trial, she escaped a worse fate as, according to the official statistics, 77 of her colleague actors were shot by the new government, including popular actors like Aleksandar Cvetkoviƒá and Jovan Tanoviƒá. In 1947 ≈Ωanka appealed the ruling admitting that she performed in theatre on her own free will because she needed money for the insulin, but that she was forced to appear on the radio by the Germans. She offered witnesses and testimonies that, during the war, she sheltered Koƒça Popoviƒá, a high ranking Communist operative, future foreign minister and Josip Broz Tito‚Äôs deputy, but also Jews Samuil Pijade and the Flore family. She pleaded that the state allow her to perform again so that she wouldn‚Äôt have to live on charity. Serbian justice minister Du≈°an Bratiƒá suggested reducing her penalty saying, ‚Äôthe defendant has been harmless to society for years‚Äô. Death In the summer of 1947, before any official decision on her sentence, she was visited by Milivoje ≈Ωivanoviƒá, one of the greatest Serbian actors, who told her that ‚Äòeverything is forgiven‚Äô. Director Bojan Stupica, who was in charge of creating the Yugoslav drama theatre and making it the forerunner of modern theatre in Yugoslavia, was adamant to get ≈Ωanka for his company. After acquiring a permissions from the Agitprop of the Central Committee and from Radovan Zogoviƒá, chief propagandist of the Communist Party, Stupica personally visited her to tell her that she can start acting again. Tragically, three days after his visit and one night before ≈Ωanka was to appear on her first rehearsal, she died. On the day when she was to be interred at the Topƒçider, thousands of people escorted her coffin, kneeling along the road where a bullock cart, with her casket on, passed to the cemetery. Rehabilitation NGO League for the protection of private property and human rights began process of rehabilitation in October 2006, soon joined in the effort by the National Theatre in Belgrade. On March 3, 2009, Belgrade's District Court officially rehabilitated her. In its ruling, the court determined that she was not politically active during the war and that her conviction was based on political and ideological reasons and not on the judicial ones. The court also established that, during the trial, she was deprived of some basic rights, like a lawyer or a defender. ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá award In 2001, on the celebration of her 60-years of acting, Mira Stupica, widow of Bojan Stupica and herself one of the greatest Serbian actresses, on stage publicly called for establishing the Velika ≈Ωanka award (Great ≈Ωanka), in honor of ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá, pointing out that there are no appropriate awards for actresses in their prime, when they are too old for the debutant awards and still too young for the life-time awards. In 2002 it was announced that the new award will be established next year, under the name of ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá award. The prize has been awarded yearly ever since, and Mira Stupica was the president for life of the jury (she died in 2016). In popular culture In 1991 Radio Television Belgrade made a TV movie Smrt gospoƒëe ministarke (Death of the cabinet minister‚Äôs wife). Directed by Sava Mrmak and written by Du≈°an Savkoviƒá, it follows ≈Ωanka's life from the trial until her death. Fueled by the stellar performance of Svetlana Bojkoviƒá as ≈Ωanka, drama gained a broad popularity, and was voted the best TV drama in the poll conducted on television's 50th anniversary. She also was an inspiration for a biography \\"≈Ωanka Stokiƒá\\" by Petar Volk (1986) and for drama \\"≈Ωanka\\" by Miodrag Iliƒá (2006) In Rabrovo, which is, as historian Simo C. ƒÜirkoviƒá noted, incorrectly regarded as her birthplace but nevertheless remains integral part of her biography, an annual theatrical festival ≈Ωanki u ƒçast (In ‚Äò≈Ωanka‚Äôs honor) is held, and on the 50th anniversary of her death, a monument to her was erected in the village. In the early 1990s, a street in Belgrade's neighborhood of Senjak was named after her.

Ziv Company (also given as Frederick W. Ziv Company) produced syndicated radio and television programs in the United States. Horace Newcomb's Encyclopedia of Television described the company as \\"by 1948 ... the largest packager and syndicator of radio programs\\" and later \\"the most prolific producer of programming for the first-run syndication market during the 1950s.\\" Background Frederic Ziv, the company's founder, developed his ideas for the company while operating an advertising agency in Cincinnati, Ohio. During the era of old-time radio, \\"Cincinnati was a surprisingly active regional center for radio production.\\" Two business entities contributed to that situation. First, radio station WLW in Cincinnati was \\"a major source of radio programming that offered local stations an alternative to network- originated programming.\\" Second, in an era when sponsors produced most radio programs, Cincinnati was the headquarters of Procter & Gamble, one of radio's \\"most influential advertisers.\\" Ziv's Juris Doctor degree from the University of Michigan proved useful in his work in syndication. Michael J. Neufeld wrote in his book, Spacefarers: Images of Astronauts and Cosmonauts in the Heroic Era of Spaceflight, \\"Ziv envisioned every sales pitch as a legal argument, anticipating counterarguments and preparing rejoinders beforehand.\\" While producing programs for WLW, Ziv met writer John L. Sinn, and in 1937 they began Frederic W. Ziv Company as a program syndication business. Concept The Ziv Company offered an opportunity to local and regional businesses that could not afford to produce programs whose quality would match that of network programs. Ziv's alternative was the use of transcriptions ‚Äì programs recorded on discs and offered to local advertisers in each radio market. Charges for the programs were based on the market's size. The result was \\"affordable quality programming that could be scheduled in any available slot on a station's schedule.\\" In an interview in Irv Broughton's book, Producers on Producing: The Making of Film and Television, Ziv noted that, although he was often called the \\"father of syndication,\\" the concept was not original with him. \\"That's the tag that followed me,\\" he said, \\"and is still being used. I developed the technique; I didn't originate it. I'm not sure if anyone preceded me. I did expand on it and brought it to what was probably its highest level.\\" Hal Erickson wrote in Syndicated Television: The First Forty Years, 1947-1987, \\"It was Frederick [sic] W. Ziv who brought sophistication to syndication, turning it into a science, combining modern recording techniques with a masterful sense of merchandising.\\"Erickson, Hal (1989). Syndicated Television: The First Forty Years, 1947-1987. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 5. Erickson added that Ziv recognized the financial advantage of syndication: \\"his company would be paid outright for its programs, avoiding the usual percentages handed over to the networks.\\" Although the company targeted stations without network affiliation, some stations that were part of networks also bought and broadcast Ziv programs. For example, in September 1951, WNBC- AM (the NBC flagship station in New York City) bought Ziv's Bold Venture, Bright Star, Favorite Story and Guy Lombardo Show for 52 weeks each. The station's general manager commented that the programs would help local business to advertise on top-budgeted shows at \\"realistic prices\\". Size At its peak, Ziv Company had more than 3,000 employees (full-time and part-time combined). In 1950, it took a five-year lease on \\"a substantial portion of the California Studios, formerly the Enterprise Film lot\\", and in 1954, it bought the Eagle-Lion Films lot in Hollywood, California. Its property included seven sound stages with related facilities such as projection rooms and cutting rooms. Promotion and support Frederic Ziv believed, \\"If a show is properly exploited and promoted, it will go.\\" To that end, Ziv Company went beyond simply selling the programs. A sales-and-service staff made calls on local stations in order to help them promote Ziv programs (both radio and television) with support materials such as \\"posters, brochures, promotional kits and ad slicks\\". The goal was to present \\"one slogan, one point of view.\\" Success was enhanced by Ziv salesmen's never trying to sell more than one program at a time to a station and their willingness to help stations find sponsors after a program was sold. Stars of Ziv programs also contributed their own efforts to support, such as when Adolphe Menjou, star of the television version of Favorite Story, traveled across the United States in 1953 to promote his then-new program. An article in the trade publication Billboard described Menjou's trip as \\"part of Ziv's stepped-up merchandising program.\\" A year later, David Brian toured cities in the Eastern United States promoting the radio and television versions of his Mr. District Attorney program. Radio Frederic Ziv's first effort in syndication came before the company was formed. In 1935, he created a program, The Freshest Thing in Town for Rubel Bakery in Cincinnati, after having first created an advertising campaign that had the same theme. When bakers in other markets heard about the show's success, they contacted the bakery's owner, who referred them to Ziv. That led to his having copies of the transcription made to send to those other bakers for broadcast in their home markets. In a 1998 interview, Ziv estimated that three dozen bakeries eventually used the program. That program lasted about five years. By 1947, the reach of Ziv Company's programming was such that 675 stations carried Ziv programs, some for as much as nine hours per week.  Three-faceted approach  Three elements worked together to contribute to Ziv's success in radio. Derek Kompare, in his book Rerun Nation: How Repeats Invented American Television, observed: > Ziv had built a network-like reputation for programming through several > shrewd principles exploiting \\"presold\\" properties by acquiring the radio > rights to established characters and texts; pursuing Hollywood-level talent > wherever possible; and making program sales and promotion the firm's top > priority in every market. Ziv himself was perhaps the most ardent supporter > of syndicated transcriptions in radio at this time [the late 1940s], > creating and distributing series that often ran on more stations than > comparable network programming. Hollywood stars The company's success was bolstered by employing movie stars for key roles in some of its series. Those stars included Dana Andrews, Irene Dunne, Fred MacMurray, Ronald Colman, Adolphe Menjou, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Such talent was not inexpensive. For example, Colman's contract with Ziv for the radio version of Favorite Story guaranteed him $150,000 per year for at least three years. Colman's contract also provided that he could record the programs at his own convenience, thus enabling him to work his radio schedule around his commitments to do films. Dunne and MacMurray signed 10-year contracts when they agreed to do Bright Star in 1951, with terms under which each would \\"gross $300,000 from the series, via their guaranties [sic] ‚Äì against percentage of sales deals.\\" One indication of the success of using recognized Hollywood talent was the fact that in 1951, Bold Venture (starring Bogart and Bacall), was sold in more than 500 cities. Repackaging 1945 advertisement for syndicated Easy Aces programs originally performed from 1937 to 1941. In addition to producing successful original programming, Ziv was a pioneer in re-using transcribed series that had already been broadcast on radio. Rather than simply reproducing the programs as originally recorded, Ziv personnel created \\"repackaged\\" versions, \\"usually with new titles and/or formats,\\" Kompare wrote. \\"For example, the company acquired the rights to Skippy Hollywood Theatre of the Air in 1951, which was retitled Movietown Radio Theatre for syndication.\\" Finances Ziv invested significant amounts of money in its radio programs. In 1946, for example, Billboard reported, \\"Three Ziv quarter-hour musical programs, each contracted for a series of 130 disks, represent an investment of $750,000.\\" The bulk of that money went to paying performers on the Barry Wood Show, Sincerely, Kenny Baker and Pleasure Parade. In 1947, Ziv had gross revenue of more than $10 million on its sales of 23 radio programs, an increase of more than 30 percent over the previous year. An article in Billboard called the company the \\"largest of the open-end transcription producers in the country.\\" Ziv's revenue was estimated to be at least one-third of the total of all transcription sales in the United States. Advertisers Revenue came not only from advertisers at the local and regional levels, but also from national sponsors such as Borden, Vicks, Wildroot Cream-Oil and Grove Laboratories. In 1950, increased advertising on television resulted in national advertisers often shifting their remaining funds from network radio to syndicated radio programs, especially those of the Ziv Company, which an article in Billboard called \\"undoubtedly the top transcription and library firm.\\" The company created new divisions in the southeast, southwest and north central United States and added 14 sales people to handle the increase in business. Television Ziv Television Programs began in 1948 as a subsidiary of the main company. Erickson described the company's approach by writing, \\"Fred Ziv tackled the new medium like a man devouring sirloin, setting up a television- film factory of the first calibre.\\" Ziv called himself \\"a pioneer as far as television production is concerned.\\" Although he had no guarantee that television would succeed, he felt safe in pursuing that direction because radio had already succeeded. \\"We felt that television was just the logical next step,\\" he said. The company's new direction led to expansion of its offices. Although the headquarters remained in Cincinnati, it eventually opened additional offices in Hollywood and New York City. Rights Ziv bought the rights to all of the programs that he produced. He commented in a 1998 interview that such rights came cheaply in the early days of TV: \\"Television was a new thing, and they didn't know if it would last. 'Why do you want those rights for 20 years [they thought] when it may not last for 20 weeks?'\\" He had the foresight to include rights for future television productions in contracts when he bought a program's radio rights, even though the people with whom he contracted wondered why he did so. He explained, \\"'Why would you want the rights to television ... when there is no television?' That's the question that was asked by the people who owned the O. Henry stories.\\" He added that television rights were inexpensive to obtain; \\"They were glad to get [the money],\\" he said. Film Ziv noted that The Cisco Kid was likely one of the first ‚Äì \\"if not the first\\" ‚Äì television program produced on film. He encountered no opposition from Hollywood because people were happy for the employment that the TV productions provided. Ziv used color film for the television version of The Cisco Kid, which began in 1949 (before color TV sets were sold). Ziv again encountered a lack of belief or understanding of what he was doing. \\"The people ‚Äì the engineers, the laboratory ‚Äì felt that the color film would never be usable ‚Äì if color ever came,\\" he said. \\"It turned out they were all wrong. Color television did come, and as you know, the programs we shot in color in the very early days are still being used.\\" Early programs The company's first two television programs were Yesterday's Newsreel and Sports Album. Material for those programs came from Ziv's purchase of General Film Library, which Erickson described as \\"so vast that it had storehouses on both coasts\\". The shows were produced by packaging segments from the library for television. Yesterday's Newsreel featured events like the Hindenburg disaster and the sinking of the Titanic. It was a 15-minute program, while Sports Album ran 5 minutes. The Cisco Kid, Ziv's first dramatic series, began in 1949 and was produced until 1956, resulting in 156 episodes. The program's gross revenue for its first 10 years in syndication was $11 million. Economee TV In 1954, the company created a subsidiary, Economee TV, to market its older programs to stations. The move came as Ziv and other syndicating companies sought to broaden their outreach and appeal to more television stations. Essentially, Economee TV handled reruns of older Ziv Television series, while the original TV operation handled new programs that Ziv produced. Erickson traced the formation of Economee TV mainly to the continuing success of Highway Patrol ‚Äì \\"the biggest money-maker Ziv ever had\\". The program, which began in 1955, was still generating profits in reruns a decade later. Competition from networks Initially, \\"We fought the networks tooth and nail every day,\\" Ziv said, \\"in Washington, before courts and before the FCC, because they had an unfair advantage\\" with regard to national advertisers. Ziv's programs were primarily sponsored by companies like Coors Brewing Company and Interstate Bakeries, which distributed products over much of the United States but were not sold in some areas. When those companies sponsored a program, Ziv would sell to other advertisers in the limited markets not reached by the main sponsor. Purchase of World Broadcasting System In August 1948, Ziv added to its library of transcribed programs by buying World Broadcasting System , with the price reported to be $1,500,000. The trade publication Broadcasting reported, \\"The deal was the latest in a series of shrewd and boldly-planned business coups that have buttressed the Ziv Company's steady-increasing pre-eminence in the packaged show field.\\" At the time of the sale, 670 AM, FM and television stations subscribed to the WBS library. Besides acquiring WBS's packaged programs, the deal also provided Ziv Company with \\"\\"the largest collection of royalty-free recorded music in existence\\", eliminating the need to pay licensing fees to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for music used in producing Ziv's programs. Sale to United Artists In March 1960, United Artists bought Ziv Television Programs, Inc. for $20,750,000. That amount included a combined $6,750,000 in installment notes and debentures and UA's assumption of approximately $14,000,000 in debt. About eight months prior to UA's purchase, two investment firms ‚Äì F. Eberstadt & Co. and Lazard Freres & Co. ‚Äì had purchased about 80 percent of Ziv Company's stock with Frederic W. Ziv and John L. Sinn keeping the remaining 20 percent. Effective with the sale, the former Ziv Company became a subsidiary of United Artists and was named Ziv-United Artists Television Co. Inc. Ziv and Sinn retained their respective positions as board chairman and president. Legacy The Frederic W.

K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The series was first broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2017, after receiving an advance premiere at the British Film Institute on 10 August 2017. The series stars Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private detective operating out of a tiny office in London's Denmark Street, who uses his unique insight and his background as a Special Investigation Branch investigator to solve complex cases that have eluded the police. Burke's casting was confirmed in late 2016, while Holliday Grainger was confirmed to play the role of Robin Ellacott. In early 2017, Kerr Logan was cast in the role of Robin's fianc√©, Matthew. Four adaptations have been broadcast to date, adapting the first four Strike novels: The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015) and Lethal White (2018). The series premiered on 1 June 2018 in the United States on Cinemax and in Canada on HBO Canada under the title C.B. Strike. Production Development On 10 December 2014, it was announced that the Cormoran Strike novel series, written by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, would be adapted for television by the BBC, for broadcast on BBC One, beginning with The Cuckoo's Calling. Rowling collaborated on the project, and it is believed she contributed to the scripts. Two years later, it was confirmed that the series would total seven episodes of sixty minutes, with shooting to begin in London in the autumn of 2016. Additional scenes were filmed at Barrow in Furness in Cumbria and a petrol station in Leyburn, North Yorkshire. The production filmed at a private house in Sevenoaks in Kent, which featured as the Bristow residence in the episodes \\"The Cuckoo's Calling\\" and \\"The Silkworm\\". The Baron's Hall and gardens at Penshurst Place were used for the illustration of scenes in the scandalous Bombyx Mori book, and the Porcupine Cafe features as the cafe on the way to Devon where Cormoran and Robin make a stop. Filming locations also included West London Film Studios. Ben Richards adapted The Cuckoo's Calling, and Tom Edge adapted The Silkworm, Career of Evil and Lethal White. Richards stated that the series is \\"very different tonally and visually from other crime dramas\\". He compared Strike to the British detective television show Morse. Similarly, Edge commented that \\"people use old- fashioned as a pejorative word, but to me that's part of why these books, and, I hope, the TV series, works so well.\\" Cast and characters Main cast * Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike * Holliday Grainger as Robin Ellacott Recurring cast * Kerr Logan as Matthew Cunliffe * Ben Crompton as \\"Shanker\\" * Natasha O'Keeffe as Charlotte Campbell * Killian Scott as D.I.

The park is named after a common plant found on the banks of the rivers of the region, called yu-kery by the indigenous people, who extracted salt from it to season their food. The plant is also known as \\"Sleeping Mary\\". When touched, it closes its leaves for a while. History The area was a ranch, Fazenda Juquery, when it was acquired in 1895 by S√£o Paulo state, under the direction of governor Jos√© Alves de Cerqueira C√©sar. The state then built the Juquery Psychiatric Hospital, designed by the architect Ramos de Azevedo, and the Juquery Agricultural Colony. In 1989 the architectural complex, the collection of documents and the green area of the Fazenda Juquery were registered by the Council for Protection of the Historical, Archaeological, Artistic and Tourist Heritage of the State of S√£o Paulo (CONDEPHAAT). The Juqueri State Park was created in June 1993 through Decree No. 36,859 to conserve important remnants of native vegetation and to preserve the water sources of the Cantareira System. Environment The park contains one of the last remnants of cerrado in the S√£o Paulo metropolitan region, as well as areas of Atlantic Forest. It is home to diverse flora and fauna. The park is threatened by wildfires and invasion by exotic species such as North American pines and Mexican agaves. The park is increasingly surrounded by urban areas. The Serra da Cantareira Forest Reserve is nearby, but the corridor linking the park to the reserve is not protected and may soon be urbanized, leading to loss of biodiversity and sustainability.

He was one of the earliest foreigners to have a major impact in the Kingdom of Hawaii, where he would eventually become a noble, and was one of the disputed creators of the Flag of Hawaii.  Life  Beckley was born in England, possibly on March 5, 1787. He moved to Veracruz when his father was granted a privateering licence by the Mexican government. In 1801, Beckley arrived in Honolulu, in what was then known to him as the Sandwich Islands. He sold his ship to local chiefs and took up residence in the kingdom. During his early years in the islands, Beckley acted as a privateer; he waylaid ships on the high seas and sold many of them to King Kamehameha I, who was attempting to consolidate his control over the kingdom. The Englishman eventually rose to some prominence in the court of Kamehameha, and Beckley became one of the king‚Äôs foreign advisors. On the occasion of the birth of the Princess NƒÅhi ªena ªena at Keauhou, Kona, Hawaii, in 1815, Beckley was made a high chief by Kamehameha I so that he might, with \\"impunity enter the sacred precincts of the grass house\\". Beckley \\"present[ed] the royal infant with a roll of China silk, after which he went outside and fired a salute of thirteen guns in her honor.\\". American missionary Hiram Bingham I mentioned in his diary that an \\"Englishman Beckley\\" occupied a position of some importance on the islands. Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue recorded his meeting with Beckley on the island of Oahu in his journal. Beckley continued to go to sea often, and was a major participator in the Sino-Hawaiian sandalwood trade. He organized trips to Fanning Island to hunt the valuable Hawaiian monk seal, and on occasion returned to privateering. Interior of the Honolulu Fort in 1853, by Paul Emmert. In 1816, Beckley became the first commander of Honolulu Fort, a military garrison erected on the waterfront of Honolulu by King Kamehameha I and Prime Minister Kalanimoku. The garrison was erected in response to attempts by Russian agent Georg Anton Sch√§ffer to build a fort on Oahu. Measuring three hundred yards on one side, the coral-rock structure was mounted with about forty guns including numerous cannons and was garrisoned with Hawaiian soldiers trained by Kamehameha I. Beckley implemented the tradition of wearing Western uniforms, gaining the name \\"Humehume\\" (cover up) by the Hawaiians. Previously the native soldiers only wore the traditional malo (loincloths). Beckley died on April 16, 1826 in Honolulu. According to the journals of American missionary Levi Chamberlain: > He was buried agreeably to his wish within his own enclosure. A vault was > dug within the walls of an unfinished house; and inclosed [sic] with bricks > & lined with mats. A part of the church buryal [sic] service was read by Mr. > Bingham, who afterwards made a short address to the bystanders both in > English & Hawaii & closed with prayer. His remains were later removed to the Oahu Cemetery where many of his descendants are also interred. A gravestone corresponding to Beckley's lifespan, although not his most recognized name, bears the inscription \\"Fredrick Beckley March 5, 1787 Died 1827\\".  Creation of the Hawaiian flag  Flag of Hawaii In 1801, the modern Union Jack replaced the former King James Union Jack. Inspired by the many British vessels that visited Hawaii, King Kamehameha commissioned a flag of his own. The exact designer of the flag is disputed between Captain Beckley and Alexander Adams, another of the British captains under Kamehameha's service. The tradition of the Beckley family maintained that Captain Beckley designed the Hawaiian flag in 1806 or 1807 and used it in his trading missions between Hawaii, China and Mexico. According to historian Albert Pierce Taylor, whose wife was a descendant of the English sea captain, he \\"was undoubtedly the originator of the flag of Hawaii\\". His journal or logbook was lost by his descendants during the 19th- century, although family records claimed that the flag was fashioned into a frock used by his children and passed down as a family heirloom. The final flag had a combination of British and American flag elements, and had one stripe for each of the Hawaiian islands. It was intended to show the neutrality of the Hawaiian Kingdom during the war between the two vital, English speaking trade partners. King Kamehameha was greatly impressed by the flag and had it flown above his residence. The flag would go on to become the flag for Kingdom of Hawaii and later the State of Hawaii.  Family and children  In 1813, he married Elizabeth Ahia (1797‚Äì1854), a Hawaiian high chiefess. She was the daughter of Kahaku ªi-i-ka-waiea, high priest of the heiau of Pu ªu o Mane ªo at Honokane, Kohala, and was granddaughter of KahƒÅnui who with his twin sister Kaha ªopulani hid and reared Kamehameha during his infancy,; ; ; When her father was charged with building Kamehameha's war canoes, Ahia served as the religious moa (mascot) for the blessing of the fleet. Known to be a haughty woman, she accompanied Beckley on his many trips to sea and dressed in both Spanish and Hawaiian fashions.; ; She was required to \\"kolokolo\\" or crawl in the presence of her husband after Beckley's royal elevation in 1815. Their hapa-haole (part-Hawaiian) descendants were regarded as members of the ali ªi (noble) class during the Hawaiian monarchy; they would go on to intermarry and form different families of their own. Their six or seven children included: #William Charles Malulani Beckley (1815‚Äì1871), who was brought up alongside Kauikeaouli, the future Kamehameha III. He married three times; his first wife was an unnamed pure Hawaiian chiefess who died childless, his second wife was Kahinu, daughter of Ho ªolulu. His third wife was Mary Ann Kame ªehiwa Tressilyan Beckley, considered \\"The Rose of the Pacific\\". His children with Kahinu included Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Sr., Maria Beckley Kahea, and George Charles Mo ªoheau Beckley, and their grandson was Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Jr.. Beckley Street in Kalihi, Honolulu is named after Frederick (William‚Äôs son). #George Frederick Hoapili Beckley (1822‚Äì1868). #Maria Kaiponui Kaipoliilii Beckley, (1817‚Äì1887), who married to Kamakahonu and later Edmund (or Henry) Kistler, who married her on her deathbed. Kistler ran off to San Francisco, stealing her fortune including Captain Beckley's diary and personal records. #Localia Beckley, born 1818. #Mary Kekahimoku Kolimoalani Beckley (1820‚Äì1850), who married Abram Henry Fayerweather. Their two daughters were Julia Fayerweather Afong, the matriarch of the Chinese-Hawaiian Afong family, and Mary Jane Kekulani Davison, later Mrs, Montano, who was the mother of Emma Ahuena Davison, wife of Albert Pierce Taylor (mentioned above). #Hannah Beckley. #Emmeline Maria Guadaloupe Beckley (1825‚Äì1850), who was named in honor of Guadalupe Victoria by the Mexican president's daughter.

Unlike debates between party-nominated candidates, which have been organized by the bi-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates since 1988, debates between candidates for party nomination are organized by mass media outlets. Party presidential debates are typically not held when an incumbent president is running for a second term. Although debates have been held in advance of the 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries among challengers to incumbent president Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee has not participated in scheduling those debates nor has Trump attended any of those debates. List of debates 1948 The Dewey‚ÄìStassen debate was the first audio-recorded presidential debate to ever take place in the United States. It featured New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey and former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen discussing the legal status of Communist Party of the United States four days before the 1948 Oregon Republican presidential primary. The debate transmitted throughout the nation via radio broadcast, and is credited with helping Dewey win the primary and the nomination of his party. It is often cited as establishing the modern presidential debate standard. This would prove to be the last time the Republicans held such an event for several decades. 1980 In what would be the start of a tradition in open primary campaigns, the first (of six) Republican presidential debate in over 30 years was held in Iowa on January 6, 1980. Former California Governor Ronald Reagan, who was the prohibitive front- runner, chose to bypass the debate. Five of the ten candidates participated: George H. W. Bush, John Anderson, Phil Crane, Bob Dole, and John Connally. The participants openly criticized Reagan for taking the state caucus for granted, which set the stage for a victory by Ambassador Bush. Reagan would participate in all further debates, including the decisive one, the February 23 debate with George Bush which became known as the \\"Ambush at Nashua\\". With Reagan boycotting the Puerto Rico primary in deference to New Hampshire, Bush won the territory easily, giving him an early lead going into New Hampshire. The Nashua debate between Ronald Reagan (left) and George H. W. Bush (right) With the other candidates in single digits, the Nashua Telegraph offered to host a debate between Reagan and Bush. Worried that a newspaper-sponsored debate might violate electoral regulations, Reagan subsequently arranged to fund the event with his own campaign money, inviting candidates John Anderson, Howard Baker, Phil Crane and Bob Dole to participate at short notice. The Bush camp did not learn of Reagan's decision to include the other candidates until the debate was due to commence. Bush refused to participate, which led to an impasse on the stage. As Reagan attempted to explain his decision, the editor of the Nashua Telegraph ordered the sound man to mute Reagan's microphone. A visibly angry Reagan responded, \\"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\\" [sic] (referring to the editor Jon Breen).\\"Reagan's Nashua Moment\\" Eventually the other candidates agreed to leave, and the debate proceeded between Reagan and Bush. Reagan's quote was often repeated as \\"I paid for this microphone!\\" and dominated news coverage of the event; Reagan sailed to an easy win in New Hampshire. Reagan won New Hampshire in a landslide. The final debate took place on April 24, at Houston Civic Center in Texas, and was between Reagan and Bush. The Moderator was Howard K. Smith and it was sponsored by the League of Women Voters 1987‚Äì1988 On October 28, 1987 Vice President George H. W. Bush fought off attacks from his Republican rivals Pete du Pont, Al Haig, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson in the opening debate of the GOP presidential campaign. It was moderated by William F. Buckley Jr. was joined by former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss. The six would debate five more times before Haig dropped out, and then three more, with varying numbers of candidates until Bush rapped up the nomination in March. 1995‚Äì1996 The debates started on Wednesday, October 11, 1995 in Manchester, NH, with 10 candidates: Governor Lamar Alexander, Senators Phil Gramm, Bob Dole, Richard Lugar and Arlin Spector; Congressman Bob Dornan; as well as hobbyists Pat Buchanan,Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Morry Taylor in attendance. There were two in January, three in February, and two in March. 1999‚Äì2000 The first televised debate took place on October 22, 1999 in Durham, NH. Congressman Gary Bauer, Senators Orrin Hatch and John McCain; as well as hobbyists Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes participated. Governor George W. Bush wouldn't join the group until the third debate, which took place in Manchester, NH on December 2. There were three in December and six in January, by which time, the only viable candidates were Bush and McCain. The final debate took place in Los Angeles, CA on March 2, with Bush, Keyes and McCain on stage. 2007‚Äì2008 21 debates were held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2008 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on May 3, 2007 and the final debate was on February 2, 2008. Twelve candidates participated in at least one debate, with the most participants in any one debate being ten. Four candidates participated in at least sixteen debates: Mike Huckabee, John McCain, Ron Paul, and Mitt Romney. 2011‚Äì2012 There were 20 debates held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2012 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on May 5, 2011 and the final debate was on February 22, 2012. Ten candidates participated in at least one debate. The most participants in any one debate was nine, in the September 22, 2011 debate in Orlando, Florida. Four candidates participated in the last four debates: Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum. Paul and Santorum were the only candidates to participate in all 20 debates. 2015‚Äì2016 There were 12 debates held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2016 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on August 6, 2015 and the final debate was on March 10, 2016. Due to the large pool of candidates, some debates were split into a primary debate and a secondary debate. Seventeen candidates participated in at least one debate. Four candidates were invited to every debate: Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump. Of these, three candidates participated in every debate (Trump declined to participate in the January 28, 2016 debate in Des Moines, Iowa). 2019-2020 Because Donald Trump is running for re-election, the Republican National Committee has not scheduled any debates for the 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries. However, private organizations have held three debates among Trump's challengers, none of which Trump has attended. Joe Walsh and Bill Weld participated in all three debates, and Mark Sanford participated in two debates before suspending his campaign. Walsh eventually suspended his campaign as well.

The house eventually merged with the House of Nesle with the marriage of Raoul II of Clermont and Gertrude of Nesle. The family is the sometimes referred to as the House of Clermont- Nesle (Maison de Clermont-Nesle). The founders of the House of Clermont are known by name only and are among the early counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis: * Baldwin I of Clermont (through 1023) * Baldwin II of Clermont (1023‚Äì1042), son of Baldwin I * Renaud I of Clermont (1042‚Äì1088), son-in-law of Baldwin II. The first Clermont for which there is any information is Hugh I, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis (1030‚Äì1102), son of Renaud I. Hugh married Marguerite, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. Among their children were: * Renaud II, Hugh‚Äôs successor as count (see below) * Ermentrude, who married Hugh d‚ÄôAvranches (Hugh the Fat), 1st Earl of Chester. Many of their children died in the White Ship disaster of 1120. * Adelaide, who married Gilbert Fitz Richard, Lord of Clare. Many of their children were prominent in 12th century England. Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en-Beuavaisis, son of Hugh, was the next prominent member of the House of Clermont. Renaud took the Cross as part of the First Crusade and participated in the siege of Nicaea and the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1097. He married three times: First, to Adelaide, daughter of Herbert IV, Count of Vermandois. Their daughter Marguetite married first to Charles I, Count of Flanders, the only son of Canute IV, King of Denmark, and, widowed, then to Hugh II, Count of Saint-Pol. Renaud‚Äôs second wife‚Äôs name is unknown (not atypical for this era). The union produced three prominent children: * Raoul I the Red, Renaud‚Äôs successor as the Count of Clermont-en- Beauvaisis * Simon I, Seigneur of Ailly-sur-Noye * Mathilde, who married Alberic III, Count of Dammartin. Their daughter Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, was in turn the mother of Joan, Countess of Ponthieu, who married Ferdinand III, King of Castile. Their daughter Eleanor of Castile married Edward I Longshanks, King of England, and had numerous children including Edward II, King of England. Renaud‚Äôs third wife was Clemence de Bar, daughter of Reginald I, Count of Bar. Renaud and Clemence had six children. At this point, the House of Clermont splits into two branches: the descendants of Raoul I the Red and those of Simon I. Raoul the Red was both count and the Constable of France (the first of many in the House of Clermont) under Philip II of France. Raoul married Alix, daughter of Valerian III, Seigneur of Breteuil, and had a daughter who married Louis I, Count of Blois, a grandson of Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Louis became Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis jure uxoris Their son Theobald VI was the last of the dynasty of Counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, selling the county to the crown in 1218. Simon I, Seigneur of Ailly-sur-Noye, lived from 1134 to 1187. Simon married Mathilde de Breteuil, daughter of Valeran III, Seigneur de Bretuil-en-Beauvaisis, and his wife Holdeburge, Dame d‚ÄôAilly-sur-Noye and Tartigny. Simon and Mathilde had four children, including Raoul II of Clermont. Raoul II, can be regarded as the founder of the House of Clermont-Nesle. Raoul married Gertrude de Nesle, daughter of John de Nesle and Elizabeth van Petegem. John‚Äôs brother was Conon, Count of Soissons, and so their father was Yves II, Count of Soissons, making John and therefore Gertrude members of the House of Nesle. Raoul II and Gertrude had six children including Simon II. Simon II of Clermont-Nesle (1210‚Äì1286) was Seigneur of Ailly, Maulette and (jure uxoris) of Nesle. Simon married Adelaide, daughter of Amaury VI of Montfort, and had numerous children including: * Raoul III of Clermont-Nesle Simon III of Clermont-Nestle, Bishop of Noyon and Beauvais * Guy I of Clermont, Marshall of France * Philippa, married to Robert VII Bertrand (d.1300), Seigneur of Bricquebec. Among their children was Robert-Jean Bertran, Baron of Briquebec, Viscount of Roncheville and Marshal of France. Raoul III of Clermont-Nestle was Constable of France and fought in the Eighth Crusade with Louis IX of France. He married Alix of Dreux, daughter of Robert of Dreux and Clemence, Viscountess of Ch√¢teaudun. The descendants of Simon II and Raoul III continued the House of Clermont for many subsequent generations, playing a major role in the later medieval country of France.

He was known for his engineering prowess. Maley was born in Albany, Western Australia, to Martha Mary (n√©e Goodchild) and Kennedy Maley. His parents were both immigrants, his father from Northern Ireland and his mother from Hampshire, England. After leaving school, Maley moved to Perth and became an apprentice to Solomon Cook, an American-born engineer. He helped Cook on a number of projects, including several bridge-building projects, and also worked on Cook's primitive steam ferries on the Swan River. Maley also assisted Richard Jewell with his rebuilding of The Causeway, which was the main river crossing in Perth at the time. He caused a stir at the official opening ceremony in 1867, interrupting the speech of the governor, John Hampton, and galloping over the bridge on horseback in order to be the first across. Earlier in the 1860s, Maley had been granted land at Greenough, the centre of Western Australia's burgeoning wheat-growing district. He moved to Greenough permanently later in the decade, and had a large two-storey homestead built with the aids of convict labour. Maley engineered the first bridge over the Greenough River, and on the river built a flour mill that supplied Greenough, Northampton, and Geraldton, as well as exporting to England. He was a long-serving member of the Greenough Road Board, and served several terms as chairman. Maley died in Greenough in December 1910, aged 71. He had married Elizabeth Kniest Waldeck in 1862, with whom he had nine sons and five daughters. Two of his sons, Charles and Henry Maley, became members of parliament. References \\"MR. J. S.

He participated in the Junta for the Preservation and Protection of Spain‚Äôs Artistic Treasures during the Spanish Civil War. Biography Antonio Bisquert P√©rez was born in Valencia in 1906 and manifested an artistic vocation already in his childhood. In 1925 Bisquert enrolled in the San Carlos School of Fine Arts of Valencia, where he secured all the first prizes in drawing and painting, and became a pupil of Mariano Benlliure. During these school years he also befriended several Spanish avant- garde artists, including Jos√© Renau. After graduating Bisquert took a position as a restorer of paintings in the Naval Museum of Madrid working with Julio Garc√≠a Condoy. In 1930 he became a professor at the \\"Escuela de Artes y Oficios\\" of Madrid. In 1934 he won the \\"Conde de Cartagena\\" fellowship from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. This allowed him to spend several years abroad in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany, and to make contact with international avant-garde artists. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 he was appointed to the board for the preservation and protection of Spain‚Äôs artistic treasures (\\"Junta de Defensa del Tesoro Art√≠stico\\"), becoming the board's technical advisor. (Link to pdf version.) He worked on the compilation, protection and preservation of the painting masterpieces from Spanish collections, and their eventual relocation to Valencia to save them from the bombings that were taking place in Madrid. During this time he was also appointed conservator-restorer of the Ministry of Fine Arts. During the war, Bisquert also worked for the Alliance of Antifascist Intellectuals and Artists, and he created numerous drawings and posters on social and war topics. His poster entitled \\"¬°Por el orden republicano! : respetad la propiedad de los peque√±os comerciantes e industriales\\" received a national award.Poster by A. Bisquert, at the Spanish Civil War posters collection, UC San Diego Library's digital collection. After the war, the Comisi√≥n de Depuraciones (Commission of Purgation) barred Bisquert from returning to his conservator-restorer post in Madrid. He opened his studio as an independent restorer, and was commissioned major jobs, such as the restoration of the paintings at Sala de Batallas, and the murals on the ceiling of the Casita del Pr√≠ncipe, both at El Escorial. As a painter Bisquert went through several periods, from an early Sorolla-like luminism, passing through abstraction, with original creations in his use of the Collage technique, and returning to realism in his later period. He died in Madrid in 1990. A retrospective exhibition of Bisquert's works was organized posthumously in Madrid in 1992, along with other works from his contemporary Luis Brihuega.\\"Bisquert y Brihuega, valores rescatados\\", article by Javier Rubio in ABC, 17 April 1992, p. 22 (in Spanish).

He was a long-term employee at the Military History Research Office (MGFA). As a contributor to the seminal work Germany and the Second World War from MGFA, Klink was the first to identify the independent planning by the German Army High Command for Operation Barbarossa. During Klink's career as a historian, he was a member of, and worked with the denialist Waffen-SS veteran lobby group HIAG. In recent assessments, some of Klink's work has been questioned due to his support for the ahistorical notions of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\" and that the German attack on the Soviet Union had been \\"preventive\\". Education and career Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, Klink's mother, was head of the National Socialist Women's League. Born in 1923, Ernst Klink grew up in Weimar and Nazi Germany; his mother was Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, head of the National Socialist Women's League. In 1941, Klink joined the SS and was commissioned to the SS Division Leibstandarte, fighting in Joachim Peiper's regiment against the Soviet Union Red Army. Reaching the rank of SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer (sergeant), he participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov. He was so severely wounded on the first day of the Battle of Kursk that he was permanently disabled from military service. After the war, Klink studied history, the German language, philosophy and the English language. He submitted his PhD thesis on the √Öland Islands dispute 1917 to 1921 at the University of T√ºbingen in 1957. During the 1950s, Klink joined HIAG, a Waffen-SS veteran's association and lobby group, set up in West Germany in 1951 by former high-ranking Waffen-SS personnel. Klink joined the Military History Research Office (MGFA) at Freiburg in 1958. His tenure at MGFA was controversial, especially in recent assessments, due to his perceived sympathy to the myth of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\". Activities within HIAG In 1958, Klink became the spokesperson for the T√ºbingen branch of HIAG, a Waffen-SS lobby group and a revisionist veterans' organisation. Klink's tenure at MGFA was controversial, especially in recent assessments. According to Jens Westemeier in his biography of Joachim Peiper, Klink was \\"one of the most important lobbyists for the in-house historical falsification\\" by HIAG. He gave lectures at veterans' meetings, assisted with documentation, and in the words of the historian J√∂rg Echternkamp, \\"cultivated the image of the clean Wehrmacht\\". Klink worked with HIAG and its in-house historian Walter Harzer to screen materials donated to the in Freiburg for any information that may have implicated units and personnel in questionable activity. In the 1960s and 70s, Klink maintained a friendship with Peiper until the latter's death; the two spoke by telephone shortly before Peiper died in a fire on the night of 14 July 1976. Klink was approached by HIAG to write Peiper's biography, but declined; he was unwilling to stake his academic reputation on an attempt to rehabilitate Peiper. Nonetheless, in 1990, Klink wrote an article sharply critical of the Malmedy massacre trial and favourable towards the Waffen-SS. According to the researcher Danny Parker, Klink \\"pretended to be a politically neutral historian at the MGFA\\", but his bias, especially towards the Waffen-SS, was obvious from the personal papers of Klink that Parker had examined. Military historian of Nazi Germany Klink was a contributor to the fourth volume, The Attack on the Soviet Union, of Germany and the Second World War, produced by historians of the MGFA. The volume appeared in 1983 and focused on Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. In what the historian David Stahel describes as \\"groundbreaking research\\" that (as of 2009) was \\"unsurpassed\\", Klink was the first to provide a comprehensive account of the military planning for Barbarossa. Klink was also the first to identify the German Army's independent planning for an attack on the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, known as Operation Otto. Stahel commends Klink on the operations study of the Battle of Smolensk, despite over-reliance on the files of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, \\"High Command of the Armed Forces\\") and the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, \\"High Command of the German Army\\"), which were at times at odds with diaries of the combat units and did not fully reflect the difficulties on the ground. Klink's colleague at the MGFA, Gerd R. Uebersch√§r, remarks that Klink based his study solely upon military records and attempted to portray the operations as \\"apolitical\\". Uebersch√§r criticises Klink for portraying Hitler as an excellent military leader, contrasting his decisions favourably to the \\"poor decisions\\" by the Chief of General Staff Franz Halder. According to Uebersch√§r, other researchers denied this notion, and it is not supported by the available records. \\"Klink's narrow military view,\\" Uebersch√§r writes, \\"also enticed him into sidling up to the long disproved Nazi claim that this was a preventive war\\".

Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Parashot The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As implemented in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English. Isaiah 59 is a part of the Consolations (Isaiah 40‚Äì66). {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. : {P} 59:1-14 {S} 59:15-21 {S} Verse 1 : Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; :: neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: Verse 2 :But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, ::and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. KJV Verse 17 :For He put on righteousness as a breastplate, :And a helmet of salvation on His head; :He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, :And was clad with zeal as a cloak. NKJV The first two lines : \\"He put on (LXX: enedusato) righteousness as a breastplate (dikaiosunƒìn th≈çraka), and a helmet of salvation (perikephalaian s≈çtƒìriou) on His head\\" are alluded in 1 Thessalonians 5:8: : \\"Putting on (Greek: 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Greek text analysis at Biblehub.com) the breastplate of faith and love ( ), and as a helmet the hope of salvation ( )\\" where Paul changes \\"the breastplate of righteousness\\" to \\"the breastplate of faith and love\\", and adds \\"hope\\" to \\"the helmet of salvation\\". The same lines is also alluded in Wisdom 5:18, which is presumably dependent of Isaiah: : \\"He will put on righteousness as a breastplate (Greek: endusetai th≈çraka dikaiosunƒìn), and he will don true judgement instead of a helmet.\\" Verse 21 : As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; :: My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, :: shall not depart out of thy mouth, :: nor out of the mouth of thy seed, :: nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, : saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.

After visiting a boy at a burn center several years earlier, Breslau recognized a need for peer support for those with burn injuries. Programs and support The Phoenix Society offers an array of support to those it serves. It has an online community to connect these people. Its program SOAR is focused on one-on-one peer support for people recently affected by burn injuries with those who have already been affected and involved in recovery, including family, friends, and caregivers. A special subset of this type of care for youngsters and adolescents also exists to address the special needs of this group. The organization holds an annual international conference, The Phoenix World Burn Congress, where \\"900 burn survivors, their families, caregivers, burn care professionals, and firefighters\\" meet and exchange information, ideas, and support.

History This chapel owns it origins to Giovanni Schembri who built it as a fulfillment to a vow he made during the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. Schembri vowed to build a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary should he and his family escape the perils of the Great Siege. Records from 1585 show that the chapel was in fact built and dedicated to the Nativity of Mary. Moreover, interesting to note is that the chapel was not mentioned in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's report of his apostolic visit to Malta in 1575 as the church was not built as yet however it is mentioned in 1598 as a 'recent building'.Ciantar, Noel. \\"Il-kappella ta‚Äô Sant‚ÄôAnna - Qrendi ‚Äì \\", Kappelli Maltin.

The feast used to be celebrated with vespers on September 8. Another feast was celebrated in honor of Saint Venera, who appears in the titular painting. In 1796, the dedication of the church was changed from that of the Nativity of Mary to that of Saint Anne. The reason for this is not known however it may be that people started to refer to the church as St Anne's due to the image of St Anne appearing in the titular painting.

In most cases, the town or city grew up around or alongside the castle (for example in Halle, Brunswick and Prague), or the castle was built in order to reinforce the defences within or as part of the line of fortification ringing the settlement as, for example, at Erfurt.  Definitions  Creighton draws a distinction between the 'urban castle', where the castle is built in or onto an existing town, and the 'castle borough', \\"where a primary castle attracts a secondary borough or the two are planned together,\\"Creighton (2002), 133. although he acknowledges that the division between the two is not always clear-cut.  Instrument of sovereign power  The urban castle was also be used as an instrument of power, for example by William the Conqueror in Norman England,Creighton (2002), 36. or by territorial lords in the Holy Roman Empire when towns in the late Middle Ages were increasingly striving for their independence. In such cases the urban castle was integrated into a strategically favourable point in the city wall so that the lord could enter the castle from the fields outside unhindered by the citizens and, through another gateway in the castle walls facing the city, could leave the castle and enter the city.  Examples   Austria  * Krems in Lower Austria, has the Gozzoburg, a high mediaeval urban castle.

The talk was brought to a halt when both sides failed to negotiate a deal.  Start of talks  Hopes for a solution was raised with the election of Akƒ±ncƒ±, a left-wing politician and long-standing advocate of inter-communal rapprochement, in the presidential election in Northern Cyprus in April 2014. He had defeated Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu, a right-wing politician who had been less committed to the idea of solution and his election was welcomed by Anastasiades. The first meeting between Akƒ±ncƒ± and Anastasiades took place on 12 May 2015, where they agreed to hold talks within the framework of the joint declaration by Anastasiades and the previous Turkish Cypriot leader, Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu. The leaders undertook joint activities, such as strolling through the line dividing the capital city, Nicosia, together, and spending time on both sides in May 2015. Furthermore, in May 2015, a number of confidence building measures were agreed upon, which included the abolishment of the requirement of filling of visa forms by Greek Cypriots when visiting Northern Cyprus and the handing of the locations of minefields in the north that had been planted by Greek Cypriots during the conflict by Anastasiades.  Progress of the talks  By December 2015, the issues of governance, citizenship and Turkish settlers had been widely discussed. According to leaked documents published by Politis, it was agreed that the federation to be established would have the responsibility of foreign policy and international agreements, that it would have a senate composed of 20 Greek and 20 Turkish Cypriots, a lower house of parliament consisting of 36 Greek and 12 Turkish Cypriots, a Supreme Court with an equal number of judges from both communities (the disagreements on resolution of disagreements persisted, but it was agreed that a foreign judge would be recruited to solve disagreements with regards to constitutional law). The two constituent states of the federation would have their own parliaments. It was agreed that a property commission would be formed, but there remained large disagreements, territory was yet to be discussed and the issue of guarantees would only be discussed with the participation of the guarantors, Turkey, Greece and the UK. It was also leaked, and later confirmed by Anastasiades in July 2016, that the population ratio had been established as 78.5% to 21.5%, at 802,000 Greek Cypriots and 220,000 Turkish Cypriots, and that all citizens of Northern Cyprus, including settlers that had acquired citizenship, would obtain the citizenship of the new state and be allowed to stay. The leak also revealed that other, non-citizen settlers would be given work and residence permits, but not immediately citizenship. An issue was posed by the discrepancy between the Greek Cypriot demands regarding the four freedoms as delineated by EU law and the Turkish Cypriot demands on retaining a Turkish Cypriot majority in the Turkish Cypriot state. Steps to resolve this included the provision that even if a Greek Cypriot moved to the north, they would still vote in the elections of the Greek Cypriot state, except for municipal elections. In November 2016, two rounds of talks were held in Mont P√®lerin, Switzerland, regarding the issue of territory. The talks broke down with no agreement on 22 November, with Akƒ±ncƒ± blaming Greek Cypriots for their \\"maximalist demands\\" and the Greek Cypriot spokesperson blaming the Turkish Cypriots' position. On 30 June 2017, UN said in a statement that Secretary General Antonio Guterres held \\"highly constructive\\" talks on Cyprus with key parties in Crans-Montana, enabling a clear vision of what could lead to a settlement. On 7 July 2017, UN-sponsored talks held in the Swiss Alps for the previous 10 days were brought to a halt after negotiations broke down. Cyprus talks in Crans-Montana ended without a peace and reunification deal. On 1 October 2017, former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that only a partitioned island will bring the dispute between Turkish and Greek Cypriots to an end. In late 2017, the Business Monitor International, part of the Fitch Group, downgraded its assessment of a new Cyprus unification deal from slim to extremely remote.

Northern California saw its wettest winter in almost a century, breaking the previous record set in the winter of 1982‚Äì83. Flooding related to the same storm systems also impacted parts of western Nevada and southern Oregon. Damage to California roads and highways alone was estimated at over $1.05 billion (2017 USD). The flooding occurred at the end of one of California's worst droughts on record, and many of the state were unprepared to handle the huge volume of rain and snow, though the heavy precipitation also helped to refill drought-impacted surface water supplies, including many major lakes and reservoirs. The impact on groundwater reserves was limited. Governor Jerry Brown declared the drought officially over on April 4, 2017.  Background  The high-amplitude ridge off the West Coast that characterized the 2011‚Äì17 California drought, dubbed the \\"Ridiculously Resilient Ridge\\", was replaced by a persistent presence of anomalous troughs impacting California. Another feature in the 2013‚Äì2015 winters was the extreme temperature contrast between a warm western U.S. and a cold eastern continent. These anomalous temperature and circulation patterns were referred to as the North American winter ‚Äúdipole‚Äù. Figure (a) shows the climatological geopotential height (Z) overlaid with its eddy component, in which the dipole centers are located (indicated by X and +). The dipole basically describes the wintertime stationary waves over North America, which contribute to the mean temperature difference between the climatologically warmer western U.S. and colder eastern half. Therefore, an amplification of the stationary wave would enhance such a temperature difference, like in 2013-2015 winters, while a weakening of the stationary wave would reverse the situation, like in 2016‚Äì2017 winter.https://sites.google.com/view/usu-climate-simon- wang/research/ca-drought-dipole?authuser=0 Indeed, in winter 2016‚Äì2017 this dipole was apparently reversed.http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/tanal/90day/mean/20170130.90day.mean.F.gif  Effects  Northern California Colusa, on February 11 In early January 2017, the Russian River in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties rose above flood stage, inundating about 500 houses. Over 570,000 customers of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company lost power in Northern and Central California during the event. Over 3,000 people in the Guerneville area were evacuated. The community of Forestville, and the nearby Laguna de Santa Rosa flooded, blocking roads and agricultural lands. Flooding in the Russian River valley inundated vineyards, causing millions of dollars in crop damage. The American River east of Sacramento reached record flows, although property damage was limited due to flood protection provided by Folsom Dam. The maximum flood release of was the highest since 1997. The popular recreation areas at the American River Parkway and Discovery Park were flooded for four months. On the early morning of February 18, flash flooding on Stone Corral Creek flooded the town of Maxwell in Colusa County. Over 100 residents had to be evacuated by boat after water filled the streets. Numerous areas in Northern California closed roads to flood and mudslide conditions, with U.S. Route 395 temporarily closed in Mono County heading in both directions. =San Francisco Bay Area= The Anderson Dam in San Jose overflowed in February for the first time in eleven years. The resulting flooding along Coyote Creek forced the evacuation of 14,000 people in San Jose and caused $73 million in damage. City workers reportedly tried to warn authorities of the flooding risk as much as a day before the river burst its banks, but it remains unclear why evacuations were not ordered until the flooding actually began. The Puerto Suello Hill Tunnel along the Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit line was partially damaged by mudslides; this delayed pre-revenue testing of the system for three weeks. = Oroville Dam spillway failures = View of Oroville Dam's main spillway (center) and emergency spillway (top), February 11, 2017. The large gully to the right of the main spillway was caused by water flowing through its damaged concrete surface. On February 7, significant damage occurred at the spillway of Oroville Dam in Butte County. However, due to heavy storm runoff into Lake Oroville, dam operators were forced to continue using the concrete spillway, eventually resulting in the destruction of the lower half of the chute. The reservoir rose so quickly that it overtopped the emergency spillway, which had never been tested for safety, and threatened to undermine it. Over 188,000 people in the Feather River valley were evacuated as officials feared the collapse of the emergency spillway, which could have sent a 30-foot (9 m) wall of water into the Feather River below and flooded communities downstream. High water flows in the Feather River caused considerable damage, collapsing the river banks and destroying large areas of farmland. The Feather River Fish Hatchery was flooded with turbid water, and several million juvenile salmon had to be evacuated from the facility. The estimated cost to repair Oroville Dam is $400 million. As of September 2018, the actual cost of repairs had risen to $1.1 billion. Central California The San Joaquin River reached its highest levels since 1997, due to the opening of upstream dams to manage flooding, and flood stage was exceeded along portions of the river. On February 20, a levee breached near Manteca, and 500 people were evacuated, though the damage was quickly repaired. Increased flow to the Fresno River, which is normally dry, and the San Joaquin River delayed construction on parts of California High-Speed Rail's Fresno River Viaduct and San Joaquin River Viaduct. Multiple landslides and bridge collapses in the Big Sur area closed a long stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, isolating coastal communities. The road is expected to reopen north of Big Sur by September, but a massive landslide about south of Big Sur may take over a year to clear. The Pioneer Cabin Tree, a giant sequoia in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, known since 1880 for its man-made \\"tunnel\\" that hikers could pass through, was toppled by one of the storms on January 9. Southern California Southern California was not as heavily hit as the north; however, storms during February 16‚Äì19 were the strongest in seven years. Five people drowned in the Greater Los Angeles urban area as heavy rainfall flooded highways, created sinkholes and cut power to 110,000 households. In Sun Valley water across Interstate 5 was more than 2 and a half feet deep, trapping motorists in their cars. In Orange County, three people were safely rescued from the Santa Ana River, while in Thousand Oaks one man drowned and three others were injured in a flash flood in Arroyo Conejo Creek. In the Santa Barbara area, flooding closed major roads including Highway 101 and led to debris flows in recently burned areas. Rural mountain communities near Goleta and Solvang were evacuated. The flooding also partially refilled Lake Cachuma, an important local water source which had essentially dried up in the preceding drought. Other impacts Dams, reservoirs, and lakes Dams were opened to relieve pressure from built-up floodwaters, with the Sacramento Weir on the Sacramento River being opened for the first time in eleven years. The spillways at Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and New Don Pedro Dam on the Tuolumne River were also opened for the first time since 1997. Overflow from the Sacramento River inundated the huge floodplain of the Yolo Bypass; peak flow through the bypass reached more than . The flooding filled multiple major reservoirs to capacity which had been previously at low levels from the drought. New Melones Lake, only about a quarter full in late 2016, reached almost 90 percent by early June 2017. Lake Berryessa also filled for the first time since 2006, causing water to overflow into the famous \\"Glory Hole\\" spillway at Monticello Dam. In Kern County, Lake Isabella hit its maximum allowed capacity for the first time in six years, leading to concerns at the Isabella Dam which is considered structurally inadequate. On the other side of the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe received the most precipitation in 117 years of record-keeping, contributing to the fastest water level rise in the lake's history. Increased outflow from Lake Tahoe contributed to flooding along the Truckee River through Truckee and Reno, Nevada. Lake Tahoe and most of the Truckee reservoirs were filled by mid-July, a level not seen since 1997. Summer flooding Heavy winter storms resulted in the largest Sierra Nevada snowpack since 2011 and the seventh largest since 1950, reaching 164 percent of the normal seasonal peak. The extremely high snowpack continued to create hazardous conditions into summer as it melted. At least 14 people have drowned in California rivers since May. In Bakersfield, the Kern River reached its highest summer levels since 1983. Over Memorial Day weekend three people drowned in the swift waters and 24 were rescued. In Yosemite National Park, the Merced River also hit dangerously high levels. On June 5, a man was swept away in the river; rangers were unable to recover his body. Long-term impacts At the beginning of the next winter season, many reservoirs still remained at above average levels, due to the inflow of storm rain and prolonged snowmelt from 2017. Some of the water had been used to replenish strained ground water levels.Reservoir overviewWater Year 2017: What a Difference a Year Makes California Department of Water Resources, September 2017 See also *January 2010 North American winter storms *Floods in California *Pineapple Express *ARkStorm *Water in California *Droughts in California *2017 California wildfires **October 2017 Northern California wildfires **December 2017 Southern California wildfires *2018 Southern California mudflows References External links * 2017 Floods 2017 natural disasters in the United States California Dam failures in the United States January 2017 events in the United States February 2017 events in the United States ","title":"2017 California floods"},{"id":"52830616","title":"Swimming at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Women's 4 √ó 200 metre freestyle relay"},{"id":"52830627","text":"The 2003 Georgia Southern Eagles football team represented the Georgia Southern Eagles of Georgia Southern University during the 2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

He was one of many researchers interested in vitamin B6 in the early 1940s and is credited as one of the discoverers of folic acid. He later focused his research on Drosophila (fruit flies), in particular the genetics and biochemistry of the heat shock response.  Early life and education  Mitchell was born on November 27, 1913, in Los Nietos, California. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Pomona College in 1936, a master's degree from Oregon State College in 1938, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1941, where he worked with Roger J. Williams and Esmond Emerson Snell in their work on vitamin B6 and folic acid. He is recognized as a co-discoverer of folic acid, which the three scientists extracted from four tons of processed spinach. In 1943 Mitchell moved from Texas to Stanford University to work as a research associate with George Beadle, who at the time was studying the genetics of metabolism in Neurospora (a fungus that served as a model organism). When Beadle moved his research group from Stanford to Caltech in 1946, Mitchell moved with him, along with other research fellows such as Norman Horowitz. Trained as a chemist, Mitchell used this experience to learn about molecular genetics, which he would apply to other model organisms in his future research.  Academic career  Mitchell began his independent research career with an appointment as an associate professor of biology at Caltech in 1949 and advanced to full professor in 1953. His early research continued to focus on the genetics of Neurospora, including the first biochemical demonstration of a missing enzyme (tryptophan synthase) from a metabolically deficient Neurospora mutant.Mitchell HK, Lein J. A Neurospora mutant deficient in the enzymatic synthesis of tryptophan. J Biol Chem. 1948;175(1):481. This finding was an essential step in establishing the central idea that genes control metabolism by producing (in a manner not then understood) the enzymes required for specific metabolic reactions. This idea came to be known as the one-gene-one- enzyme hypothesis, and later the one-gene-one-polypeptide hypothesis. He subsequently worked on the genetics of Drosophila (fruit flies), a widely known model organism for studying genetics and development. Using fruit flies as models, he made major discoveries in understanding the heat shock response and has been described as a \\"founding father\\" of the heat shock field. With research fellow Robert P. Wagner, Mitchell coauthored a textbook called Genetics and Metabolism in the 1950s. It was reviewed as an important guide to the then-emerging synergy between the two fields. Mitchell retired from Caltech in 1984, assuming professor emeritus status.  Personal life  Mitchell was an enthusiastic athlete who brought his hobby to Caltech, establishing a recreational athletic league for graduate students and managing the Caltech teams, which included students and faculty from a variety of departments, for 25 years. Mitchell was also a self-taught glassblower who used his skills to make chemistry laboratory equipment and for a time supported his family by working in a glassblowing shop. Mitchell suffered a debilitating stroke in 1990, and recovered his speech but continued to have physical difficulties and used a wheelchair thereafter. He died on April 1, 2000 after suffering a second stroke.

Climate change has worsened at the hands of human activity for centuries, and many scientific efforts have been made since the first political acknowledgment. In order to avoid the ongoing and potential impacts of climate change, mitigation technologies have been developed in order to adapt to the issue, each invention belonging to one of four specific groups of effort. These groups include energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy (RE), nuclear power/energy (NE), and carbon capture storage (CCS). However, concerns regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change commonly have a priority focus on the groups of carbon capture storage and renewable energy efforts. Traditionally, areas of western civilization around the world have the resources and finances to successfully develop and maintain technological mitigators to climate change. The research and development of these technologies require funding and incur high costs. There is a global inconsistency in producing these inventions, leaving developing countries without the means to defend themselves against the issue of climate change. Ironically, some of these areas are powerless enough while being the most inflicted by climate change in the world. Climate change was mentioned as early as 1896 by Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius. The topic did not emerge as a political issue until the 1950s. Public policy is its own actor in the business of climate innovations through its control over the activity of emitting and reducing pollution inventions. Predominantly, legislature works to control the innovations particularly through placing restrictions on the amount of pollution that can be produced, and time crunches on when certain changes by companies using polluting inventions need to be completed by. It is up to the state that is implementing policy and the pollution-contributing businesses to work towards the implemented legal requirements in order to reach environmental goals by a set date.  Political Influence  The beginning of the era to protect the environment started with common law, founded in the law of nuisance. This introduction solely allowed for the action of private work to improve land when harmed (including removing the smell from pig stys, fixing broken dams, and enforcing strict liability). Any other enforcement was stringent to only deal with any major environmental threats, only being able to adequately protect the common resources. Profound regulation to protect the environment was first seen from England law, triggered by environmentally damaging events. Catastrophes such as the \\"Great Stink\\" (the dumping of sewage in a River Thames by parliament) ignited a movement in protective legislature to establish the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848. As well, the \\"Great Smog\\" (a massive buildup of air pollution) promoted the development of England's Clean Air Act 1956. The environmental regulations imposed limitations on the amount of emissions from household and business establishments that can be produced, and inspectorate forces to ensure compliance. ‚ÄúEnvironmental law‚Äù only became a distinct and separate body of legislature in all developed and many developing nations in the 1960s, upon the recognition that the natural environment is in desperate need of aid to sustain itself, being so fragile. While state regulations are in place to reduce emissions in effort to protect the environment's air quality, international initiatives have worked towards addressing the broader issues. For instance, the many chemicals that harm the ozone layer have been globally restricted to emit through the development of programs that focus on the trading of emissions (a focus reducing acid rain or adapting to climate change). The programs also collaborate to identify and categorize air pollutants and state the acceptable level of emissions and necessary mitigation technologies. Water quality is also a prominent topic with the concern of improving the environment, as the factor has a direct and immediate impact on the life around it. State regulations per nation implement policies regarding sewage treatment and disposal, as well as managing all agricultural and industrial wastewater. Legislatures also work to control the level of surface runoff that comes from construction sites in predominantly urban environments. Additionally, international efforts also look to identify and categorize water pollutants and state the acceptable concentration levels in water resources. Moreover, policies are able to manage municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, and nuclear waste, among many other types through governance of its transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. In terms of containment clearance (of sediment, soil, surface, and ground water), there are policies that work as a protective, rather than preventative measure. They are administered through response actions that are vital to repairing damaged media of the environment. Not only are policies needed for improvements, but as well the effort by people to undertake responsibility or pay for it. Governed actions include emergency response services, liability allocation, assessing the site, remedial investigation and action, feasibility studies, site reuse, and post-remedial monitoring. Finally, laws that govern man-made chemical safety from modern industrial application include the management of human activities. These policies strictly work to ban some chemical pollutants (particularly in consumer products, such as Bisphenol A material in plastic bottles) and regulate pesticides.  Scientific Background  Technological change and scientific processes play an important role through research, inspiring the creation, distribution and exploitation of knowledge. These scientific advances improve technological innovation for climate change mitigation. They are vital to use in strategizing methods to adaptation, being necessary while climate change threatens the world. Presently national technology systems focus on growth in jobs and output, instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing energy efficiency. Adaptation strategies are meant to reduce any vulnerability of available technologies and the need for adaptation at all with scientific technologies including energy efficiency improvements, and production of renewable energy (RE), nuclear power/energy (NE), and carbon capture storage (CCS).  Energy Efficiency Improvements  Energy efficiency is a concept used to define the focus of tackling climate change by creating energy efficient technologies and products (they are meant to use less energy to provide the same service). Energy efficiency is an important tool for climate adaptation because it preserves and extends resources in the long-run. It also minimizes the costs for the state in adapting the energy sector for climate change. The least costly way to meet the increased demand for energy is by saving energy. However, developing countries struggle with the trade-off between energy efficiency and economic performance in keeping up with their expanding economies, since they require large increases in energy production and consumption. Improving energy efficiency does not only include the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It varies and depends on the energy being supplied for the particular technology, such as fossil fuels from a coal-fired plant that produces gasoline for cars. Improved efficiency will cut emissions for fossil fueled technologies compared to low carbon sources, such as electricity which is produced from renewable energy. Nonetheless, improving energy efficiency is a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and most low carbon sources (which includes renewable energy and carbon capture storage).  Renewable Energy (RE)  Renewable energy is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind, and rain. Renewable technologies function from resources that vary from solar power, wind power, to hydroelectricity and are constantly renewed. Renewable energy technologies have an advantage over conventional energy systems, as they have a much lower impact on the environment and are considered a clean source of energy. A disadvantage to using renewable energy includes the source's unstable market, with uncertain profitability from the competition of fossil fuels. The energy source therefore is not in a likely position to gain much support from the state and private sector. Renewable sources are being encouraged to address the issues and challenges that arise from greenhouse gas inflictions. Most renewable energy technologies are generated from sunlight, which creates solar energy (power). This solar energy is the most efficient renewable resource on the planet, predominantly generating electricity but also sourcing power for the purposes of heating and water purification. Solar energy is conducted using heat from the sun, which is absorbed by wind turbines, in capturing wind that generates wind power. The use of solar renewable technologies plays a large roll in emission reduction for mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution and addressing concerns with energy security.  Nuclear Energy (NE)  Nuclear power is conducted by the released nuclear energy from nuclear reactions. The power is ignited heat from reactions, which is most commonly used in the powering of electricity-producing steam turbines, located in nuclear power plants. Nuclear fission is a type of nuclear reaction that is a leading form of low carbon power generation. The commercialization of entire power stations was first introduced in the 1970s. Entire power stations that are run by fission- electricity are known to have emission values that are lower than that of renewable energy stations in terms of a greenhouse gas emissions per cycle (of a generated unit of energy). The median value of all commercial sources for baseload energy is lowest for this method and second to lowest for all technologies of commercial electricity. The first establishments of these plants prevented 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, emitted by the thermal power stations that burn fossil fuels. Nuclear power is acclaimed by the World Nuclear Association and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy to be the safe and sustainable energy source in reducing carbon emissions. Retrospectively, the corporations of Greenpeace International and NIRS are known to be opposed to nuclear power, arguing that it threatens the environment more than anything.  Carbon Capture Storage (CCS)  Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, and its levels have increased from human activity, promoting incidents such as fossil fuel combustion. One of the main technologies meant for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is carbon capture storage (CCS). This involves the absorption of carbon dioxide to prevent it from entering the atmosphere from emitting sources, such as natural gas processing plants or power plants. Carbon capture storage is a technology that can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of fossil fuels in generating electricity or industrial processes. Fossil fuels impact the environment when combusted in quantities that restrict the ability to stabilize safe levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon capture storage involves a three- step process of acquiring the carbon dioxide, transporting it, and securely storing it away. First, the technology separates the carbon dioxide from the gases produced in the electricity generation or industrial processes in methods of pre-combustion captures, post combustion capture, or oxy-fuel combustion. Then, the separated carbon dioxide is transported for safe storage via either pipeline or ship. The carbon dioxide is stored carefully in depleted natural gas fields or selected geologic rock formations underground, that are usually located a few kilometres underneath the earth's surface. The further development of advances in carbon capture technologies means for more success in future capture processes. The main barrier is the cost and efficiency issues of capturing carbon dioxide from power generation.  Economic Factors  Economic factors need to be taken into account when determining the current and expected future improvements of technologies for climate change adaptation. The economic factors, which are described through the supply and demand chain, are important for understanding the rate and direction of the progresses of technological change. The state determines the supply, based on the relevant scientific and technological knowledge and opportunity. As well, the state assesses the costs and availability of resources, such as the trained technicians and experienced workers that are involved in the research processes to create and improve climate change adaptation technologies. Whereas, the demand for innovation depends on the amount of cost reduction from the particular technology being used, as well as the consumer and producer benefit from a new or improved technology for existing goods. Technologies for climate change mitigation are meant to create energy efficient products and services that result in economic benefits to its consumers and to the environment. The state can track energy efficiency improvements through the policies that regulate prices in markets. In an economic perspective, greenhouse gas emissions are considered ‚Äòexternalities‚Äô that are not fully traded and priced in markets, lacking credible market value. Addressing climate change becomes an issue for society and cannot be achieved simply from the progresses of private markets, consumers and producers. Issues such as, directly regulating personal choices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require the government to outlaw large cars, raise carbon or fossil fuel taxes, and even increase public transit spending. Furthermore, subsidising production and diffusion throughout society is politically less challenging because technological innovation is substantial to economic growth. Energy efficiency improvements directly affect the consumers (i.e. in 2016, the Canadian government helped citizens‚Äô save $12 billion in energy costs in 2013, accumulating an average savings of $869 per household). For technological innovation to achieve economic sustainability, an economy would have to ensure responsible and limited use of natural resources that are non-renewable or not harmful to the environment, such as fossil fuels or uranium. A sustainable economy uses various strategies for engaging optimal resources, to achieve a beneficial balance in the long term. Presently, there is technology already existing that can effectively reduce and even stabilize greenhouse gas levels within the next few decades. However, the issue is that it is economically and politically difficult to initiate and install energy efficient products, using renewable energy sources (i.e. wind power). Social and political barriers limit the progress of implementing technologies and meeting the demands of effective climate change mitigation.

Biography Origins and early career He was born into a priestly family in Satulung, Bra»ôov County, a village that today is incorporated into SƒÉcele city, close to Bra»ôov. At the time, the area was part of the Austrian Empire, and was located in the southeast part of the Principality of Transylvania. He attended the Romanian gymnasium in Blaj, an institution run by the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. From 1843 to 1846, he studied at the law academy in Cluj. His colleagues included Avram Iancu and Alexandru Papiu- Ilarian; together with the latter, Popea edited a weekly publication they distributed to the city's Romanian students. In 1846, he left for the University of Vienna to study theology. Rather than complete his studies, Popea returned home to take part in the 1848 Revolution. He took part in the May assembly at C√¢mpia LibertƒÉ»õii, was elected to the delegation that intended to present the resulting petitions to the Transylvanian Diet and was a captain in the Bra»ôov-based Romanian guards.PƒÉcurariu, p. 144 After the revolution was defeated, he worked in the state administration for several years, first at Deva and then at »òomcuta Mare.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 144-45 In late 1854, Andrei »òaguna, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania, summoned Popea to work at the archdiocesan administration in Sibiu, initially as secretary. In a public ceremony held on the Annunciation in 1856, »òaguna tonsured the younger man a monk, with the name Nicolae. He was made a hierodeacon at the same time, later rising to hieromonk and protosingel. Also in 1856, he was named professor of theology at Sibiu's theological and pedagogical institute. He remained a secretary, later rising to diocesan adviser. He taught church history, morals and canon law; his pupils included Zaharia Boiu, Nicolae Cristea, Ilarion Pu»ôcariu, Dimitrie Com»ôa and Daniil Popovici-Barcianu. Popea taught until 1870, when »òaguna named him archdiocesan vicar, a post he would hold until 1889. In 1871, »òaguna made him an archimandrite. He joined the diocesan and national synods, and presided over the former when the ailing »òaguna was unable to attend.PƒÉcurariu, p. 145 Politics, metropolitan candidacies and move to Caransebe»ô In the 1860s, Popea began to involve himself in national politics. He served in the Diet from 1863 to 1865, and later in the Austrian House of Lords. He also sat in Hungary's House of Magnates, where he repeatedly spoke on behalf of the Romanian nation and church. \\"Nicolae Popea\\", in Biserica »ôi »òcoala, Nr. 31/1908, p. 2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) From 1878 to 1881, he was president of the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania, and was a proponent of the activist strategy that called for participation in political life. In 1881, he renounced this honorary position, observing that most members had opted for passivism, retreating from involvement in provincial affairs.PƒÉcurariu, p. 146 After »òaguna's death in 1873, Popea was considered a popular candidate to succeed him, but enemies of the late metropolitan and his protege, led by Vincen»õiu Babe»ô, mounted a press campaign that led the latter to withdraw from consideration. The new metropolitan, Prokopije Ivaƒçkoviƒá, spent less than a year in office, forcing a new election. Popea ran this time, losing to Ioan Popasu. However, as Popasu was not accepted by the authorities, another election was called. This time, Babe»ô was joined by Ioan Me»õianu, Ioan Hannia and other members of the anti-»òaguna faction in mounting opposition to Popea, who lost to Miron Romanul.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 146-47 During the periods when the see was vacant, vicar Popea was in charge, and after Miron's rise, he continued to be very influential, drawing support from professors at the institute (many of them former students of his), and laymen such as Eugen Brote, Ioan Pu»ôcariu and newspaperman Ioan Slavici. This oppositional faction sought to uphold »òaguna's program of national development by safeguarding the church's autonomy, fostering education and ensuring good administration and merit-based promotion within the archdiocese. It was only after about a decade that Miron was able to gain the upper hand within the synod.PƒÉcurariu, p. 147 Popasu died in February 1889, creating a unique opportunity for Miron to rid himself of his troublesome deputy. Thus, in April, the synod elected Popea as the next Bishop of Caransebe»ô. The following month, after Miron lobbied the authorities, Emperor Franz Joseph approved the choice. Miron and Me»õianu, the Bishop of Arad, consecrated Popea at Sibiu in June, and in July he was enthroned at Caransebe»ô.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 147-48 As bishop, he fostered the growth of the local theological institute, founded by Popasu. He provided for a new building, and sent several young men to Czernowitz and other universities, then naming them professors. Together with other hierarchs, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic, he called for the Romanian character of the confessional schools to be preserved; this was in danger from a series of laws approved by the Diet of Hungary. He supervised the diocesan press, including its newsletter Foaia DiecezanƒÉ, started by Popasu.PƒÉcurariu, p. 148 Historical writings and legacy Popea published several articles on history and speeches in Foaia and in Telegraful Rom√¢n, as well as in the Vienna-based Die Zukunft, Wanderer and Ost und West. He worked to reprint liturgical books and school texts, including those for the institute. In 1885, he revised and republished »òaguna's manual of canon law. His first book of history was Vechea Mitropolie ortodoxƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ a Transilvaniei, suprimarea »ôi restaurarea ei, which began appearing in serial form in 1868 before being published in 1870. The introductory portion, dealing with the origins of the ancient metropolis of Transylvania, is obsolete today. The author then moves on to criticize the founding of the Greek-Catholic Church before discussing the restored metropolis, including a series of acts and documents that remain relevant. The book received criticism from Greek-Catholic scholar Ioan Micu Moldovan, to whom Popea responded with a counterattack.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 148-49 In 1873, the year of »òaguna's death, Popea became his first biographer, publishing a sketch that appeared first in the pages of Telegraful Rom√¢n and then as a 34-page brochure. A full-length biography followed in 1879, and a decade later, Popea published a book about the metropolitan's political struggles.PƒÉcurariu, p. 149 In September 1877, as recognition for his writings on history, Popea was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy, an institution based in the neighboring Romanian Old Kingdom. He was raised to titular status in April 1899. Following Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, he thus became the second bishop to join the Academy as a full member. Popea delivered his reception speech in 1900 before the members, with King Carol I and Prince Ferdinand in attendance. This too dealt with »òaguna, and was published later that year, running to 42 pages. Popea's final years were marked by illness. He also suffered due to the Magyarization policy promoted by Education Minister Albert Apponyi and the forceful intervention of the authorities in the affairs of the theological institute. In 1908, shortly before the bishop's death, the government fired four professors, among them Ilie Minea and Enea Hodo»ô, for their political activity. Popea was buried in the cemetery of Caransebe»ô' Saint John the Baptist Church; an appreciative obituary from Nicolae Iorga followed. He willed his entire estate of 300,000 korona to the diocese, in order to fund scholarships for young Romanian students.PƒÉcurariu, p. 150 Notes References *Mircea PƒÉcurariu, CƒÉrturari sibieni de altƒÉdatƒÉ.

It was published in 1743 in Fielding's Miscellanies, third volume. It is a satiric account of the life of London underworld boss Jonathan Wild (1682‚Äì1725). It is an experiment in the various narrative genres that were popular at the time: serious history, criminal biography, political satire, and picaresque novel. Some have argued that it is mainly a satire on Britain's first Prime Minister Robert Walpole, who was continuously charged by his political enemies with allegations of corruption. Battestin, 1989 pp. 281-282 Plot summary The book tells the satiric biographical story of an early 18th-century underworld boss, Jonathan Wild, from his birth in 1682 until his execution in 1725. As a thief-taker, Wild's job was to capture criminals and take them to the authorities in order to collect a reward, but he made notorious profit from managing an underground network of malefactors who paid him to avoid being denounced. Fielding's biography of Jonathan Wild allows him to satirize various aspects of English society at the time.. It features an interpolated romantic story that is nowhere to be found in other accounts of the historical Wild. It has been argued that this was Fielding's way of rendering the criminal biography of Wild into a novel of the kind that was becoming increasingly popular in his time.

The score is used by financial investors in order to find the best value stocks (nine being the best). The score is named after Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.  Calculation procedure  The score is calculated based on 9 criteria divided into 3 groups. :::Profitability #Return on Assets (1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise); #Operating Cash Flow (1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise); #Change in Return of Assets (ROA) (1 point if ROA is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise); #Accruals (1 point if Operating Cash Flow/Total Assets is higher than ROA in the current year, 0 otherwise); #:Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds #Change in Leverage (long-term) ratio (1 point if the ratio is lower this year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise); #Change in Current ratio (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise); #Change in the number of shares (1 point if no new shares were issued during the last year); #:Operating Efficiency #Change in Gross Margin (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise); #Change in Asset Turnover ratio (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise); Some adjustments that were done in calculation of the required financial ratios are discussed in the original paper.

Life  Mikl√≥s J√≥sika was born on in 1794 in Turda, a village in Central Europe's Pannonian Basin which was at the time under Hungarian control. He was the son of Baron Mikl√≥s J√≥sika and his wife Eleanor, and was brought up in circumstances of wealth and privilege. His mother Eleanor died in 1797, and Mikl√≥s was brought up by his paternal grandmother. As a young man he attended a course in legal studies at Klausenburg, graduating in 1811. Military career In 1812 J√≥sika obtained a commission in a cavalry regiment of the Hungarian army, which was engaged in a campaign in Italy as part of the Sixth Coalition of the Napoleonic Wars. He was present at the second battle of the Mincio River in February 1814, serving under Austrian command against French and Italian troops, and was elevated to the rank of lieutenant. Promoted to captain in March 1814, he remained in active service until Napoleon's defeat later that year. In 1815 he took part in the campaign in France, and from 1816 to 1818, he was stationed in Vienna. Politics and writing J√≥sika's tomb at the H√°zsong√°rd cemetery. In 1817 J√≥sika became engaged to Elizabeth K√°llay of the K√°llay family. He resigned his army commission in 1818 and returned to Hungary where he and Elizabeth were married. Their relationship quickly soured, and J√≥sika eventually left his wife in Budapest and relocated to his father's estate in Szurdok, more than away. There he took up politics; having succeeded to his father's title of Baron, he took part in the legislative debates of the Transylvanian Diet in 1834 where he aligned himself with the anti-Habsburg opposition headed by Baron Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi. Historians describe J√≥sikas political views as liberal and aligned with those of writer S√°ndor B√∂l√∂ni Farkas, who in turn was an advocate of British and American democracy. Together with other noblemen, Wessel√©nyi and J√≥sika formed a faction in the Diet known as the \\"Moderate Conservatives\\", and more picturesquely as the \\"Pro-British League of Transylvanian Aristocrats.\\" Their central political stance was to call for parliamentary reform to enhance democracy while preserving the role of the Crown. In this they stood in opposition to the more conservative pro-monarchy majority, and to the \\"Radical Opposition\\" headed by lawyer, and later Regent- President of Hungary, Lajos Kossuth. In addition to politics J√≥sika turned his hand to writing, producing more than 60 romance novels between the early 1830s and 1854. His first work, Abafi, was published in 1836.Isbell 2008, p.511 The book is a morality tale, describing a fictional knight in the service of Tranyslvanian prince Sigismund Bathory. Over the course of the book the eponymous hero transforms his life from one of debauchery to public respect and promotion, before sacrificing himself in battle to protect his prince. It was Josika's best-selling work, and was an inspiration to inventor Nikola Tesla, among others, who credited it with setting him on the path to mental self-discipline.Carlson 2013, pp.23-24 Elements of J√≥sikas liberal political philosophy were evident in his casting of the characters, and the work remained popular among socially progressive Hungarians into the early twentieth century. J√≥sikas literary achievements garnered him substantial societal recognition in Hungary. In the late 1830s he was elected as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and of the Kisfaludy Society, a prominent literary group of which he became director in 1841 and vice-president in 1842. His political pursuits continued; in 1847 he appeared before the Transylvanian Diet as a representative for Szolnok to unsuccessfully advocate for a formal union between Transylvania and Hungary. Influenced by his political allies, he also converted to Protestantism. In 1847 he procured a divorce from his wife Elizabeth, whom he had not seen for many years. Once this was obtained J√≥sika immediately entered into an engagement, and then marriage with Baroness Julia Podmaniczky, a fellow writer and member of an influential Hungarian family. Later years The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 gave power to the Radical Opposition, including J√≥sikas erstwhile political foe Louis Kossuth. J√≥sika closely associated himself with the new government, and was rewarded with appointments to a restructured Hungarian Upper House and to the committee of national defence. The counter-revolution of 1849 was therefore unwelcome, and J√≥sika and his wife were forced to flee to Dresden. They never returned to Hungary, relocating instead to Brussels in 1850 where J√≥sika returned to writing romance novels under a pseudonym. In declining health, he returned to Dresden in 1864 and died there on 27 February 1865. His body is interred in the Hajongard cemetery in Cluj-Napoca, around from his birthplace of Turda.

It is the proposed development site for the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park ().  Political status  With a land area of only 0.97 km2, the Lok Ma Chau Loop is currently the only unincorporated area in Hong Kong. Because every piece of land in Mainland China belongs to a county-level (third level) administrative division,Guo, Rongxing. Understanding the Chinese Economies. Academic Press, September 19, 2012. , 9780123978264. p. 13. this makes the Lok Ma Chau Loop the only unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China. Eddie Chu, a Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, lodged an inquiry to various local authorities on 29 March 2019, urging them to take the necessary steps to incorporate the Lok Ma Chau Loop into one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong (most likely to be a part of North District or Yuen Long District).ÈóúÊñºÔ∏∞ËêΩÈ¶¨Ê¥≤Ê≤≥Â•óÂú∞ÂçÄÂèäÁâπÊÆäÂú∞ÂçÄÁöÑÈÅ∏ÂçÄÂäÉÂÆö  Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park is a proposed new hi-tech development at the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China. It is located in Hong Kong's New Territories near the area of Lok Ma Chau, adjacent to the Sham Chun River. The development of the technology park was announced on 3 January 2017 during a joint ceremony by the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. When completed, it will be the largest technology park in Hong Kong with a land area of 87 hectares and is expected to boost the city's global position in technology and provide an incubator for technology start-ups.  Details of the development  Until the late 1990s, the Lok Ma Chau Loop was a part of Mainland China. When some engineering work was done to straighten the winding Sham Chun River, the natural border moved north and effectively left the landmass of the loop only accessible from Hong Kong. Dispute of ownership of the land continued until recent years. With the agreement of the technology park, the land dispute has been settled. Once developed, the technology park is expected to provide 1.2 million square metres of additional office spaces to be used by Hong Kong and Shenzhen companies. The technology park is expected to be managed by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Corporation.  Criticism  = Environmental = The proposed park is located in a current green land area, a buffer zone between the urban agglomerations of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Environmental groups claim the park is located in an important flightpath for migratory birds. The wetlands form an ecosystem that continues west along Sham Chun River and the development may thus affect Deep Bay. The Hong Kong wetland park and the Mai Po Marshes are also along this route. The groups estimate the loss of 4,000 trees, 11 hectares of reed marsh and 9 hectares of ponds. In addition, it is thought that the current marsh land site contains significant amounts of contaminated mud which may pose an environmental risk and a challenge to decontaminate. = Rationale = Hong Kong has two existing high profile business and technology parks, Cyberport on Hong Kong Island and Science Park, also in the New Territories. Both were conceived in the wake of the 1997 Asia financial crisis in order to boost technology investments, but their uptake has been slow and is only just starting to come to fruition. Especially Cyberport has been marred with image problems, starting from its delayed development to lacking in commercial success. Lok Ma Chau loop has been claimed to be at risk of repeating some of the Cyberport experience by being yet another government run development on the green field with poor transport links while there is ample existing office space in and around Hong Kong which may be suitable for start-ups in a more economical and more relevant way in a world of virtual collaboration. On the other hand, some local business groups welcome the technology park, but are mindful that lessons are learned from previous developments and that there should be all effort for a speedy development. Questions have been raised whether the true ambition of the government is to support the technology industry, or to obtain land for profitable real estate development.

In a unanimous chamber decision on 10 January 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that states had a wide margin of discretion with regard to the balance between religious freedom and the state's wish to educate pupils according to their tradition and needs. It put emphasis on the fact that in the opinion of the court the school had shown flexibility by offering to allow the girls to swim in burkinis and to change their clothes in a room with no boys present. It further found that it was important for social integration, particularly for children of foreign origins, that pupils take full part in their education and not be exempted because of their parental background. The court thus found that the Swiss authorities had been within their rights when they fined the girls' parents, also saying that the fine in this case was proportional to the aim pursued and not an unduly harsh punishment. As a chamber judgment, the result may be appealed to the Grand Chamber.Howard Friedman. (11 January 2017) \\"European Court Rejects Muslim Parents' Complaints About Mixed Swim Lessons In Schools\\".

Jocelyn sings lead vocals and plays piano, while Chris plays lead and rhythm guitar. The two write all of their music together as a brother-sister team. Biography Group history Jocelyn and Chris grew up in Fort Plain, a small town in rural upstate New York. The two siblings both began music lessons in elementary school. Jocelyn started learning piano in fourth grade after receiving her first electric keyboard. Chris began guitar lessons just a few months later. Jocelyn and Chris began performing publicly at local talent shows, festivals, and fairs. Their first public performance was at a local benefit talent show when Jocelyn was 12 and Chris was 11, where they performed a cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". In middle school, they formed their own band \\"The Dependents.‚Äù They were performing under this moniker at the Fonda Fair in Fonda, NY, when they were approached by producer/manager David Bourgeois. The two subsequently signed a development deal with Bourgeois' music development company, Bridge Road Entertainment, in Albany, NY, in 2013. In the following years, Jocelyn & Chris have released two studio EPs (\\"Strangers in Fairyland\\" and \\"Still: A Holiday Collection\\"), two full- length albums (\\"Edges\\" and \\"Go\\"), and a live LP \\"30,000 Miles,\\" all under Bridge Road Entertainment. Their third full-length album The Fun in the Fight is slated for release on February 22, 2019. Musical inspiration Jocelyn & Chris grew up listening to a large variety of music, including blues, jazz, folk, rock, and pop. The duo frequently credit their parents' large CD collection with having had a huge impact on their current musical style. When they began to write their own original music together in middle school, this diverse range of musical influences led to the formation of a distinctive sound that has been described as \\"an affinity for retro grooves and classic rock moves with a unique, modern twist.\\" Education In addition to their musical careers, both Jocelyn and Chris are alumni of Harvard University. Jocelyn graduated in May 2017, while Chris graduated a year later in May 2018. Television In a 2017 interview with Music Connection Magazine, Jocelyn revealed that she has been approached by casting agents from NBC's The Voice on two separate occasions. In both cases she declined to pursue the opportunity, opting instead to continue to write, record, and tour with her brother and their band. A December 2017 EdgeTV Network article about the group's music video for single \\"Red Stops Traffic\\" revealed that Jocelyn had also turned down an opportunity to appear on the new FOX music competition show The Four. On March 7, 2019, Jocelyn & Chris and their band performed their song \\"Outta My Head\\" live on NBC's Today Show. Personal life In high school, both siblings worked at Gore Mountain in North Creek, New York, Jocelyn as a ski instructor and Chris as a snowboard instructor. Notable performances Along with their band, Jocelyn and Chris have performed at hundreds of music festivals and venues across the country, including the Sundance Film Festival, the CMJ Music Festival in NYC, Mountain Jam Festival in Woodstock, NY, South by Southwest in Austin, TX, and Summerfest in Milwaukee, WI, where they were voted Best Act on the Emerging Artists Stage. Additionally, the group has played music venues such as The Viper Room and Hotel Caf√© in Hollywood, CA, 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville, TN, Higher Ground in Burlington, VT, and The Bitter End and Rockwood Music Hall in NYC. They have provided direct support for X Ambassadors, Eve 6, Delta Rae, Gin Blossoms, Vertical Horizon, Rick Derringer, Orleans, Dennis DeYoung, Marc Cohn, Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers, and others.\\"Jocelyn & Chris Arndt.\\" Reverbnation.

Scenes propel a story forward as the character attempts to achieve a goal.Swain, p. 84-85. Sequels provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.Swain, p. 96-100. Scene The concept of a scene in written fiction has evolved over many years. Dwight V. Swain, in Techniques of the Selling Writer (1965) defined a scene as a unit of conflict, an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster. In The Art of Fiction (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.Gardner, p. 59. Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of scene, and to explain its use and structure.Bickham, p. 23.Klaassen, p. xxii.Obstfeld, p. 2.Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.Scofield, p. 12. Sequel In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a sequel as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) dilemma, and (3) decision.Swain, p. 96, 100. Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a sequel and to explain its use and structure.Bickham, p. 50-51.Morrell, p. 84.Klaassen, p. xxiv. Proactive vs. reactive Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.Marshall, p. 61, 63.Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170. Scenes and sequels Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that *An author controls pacing by the way he proportions scene to sequel. *The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels. *Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.Swain, p. 113-115. Structural units of fiction The structural units of fiction writing comprise all fiction.Klaassen, p. 3. *The smallest units of writing are words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and paragraphs. *Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as passages or segments of writing.Scofield, p. 12-13. *Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A scene is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A sequel is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.Klaassen, p. 2. *A chapter is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a chapter break.Lukeman, p. 159. Prologue and epilogue are two specialized types of chapters. *A chapter may include one or more sections, passages separated by another form of punctuation called a section break.Lukeman, p. 160. *Some novels, especially long ones, may be further divided into books or parts, each including two or more chapters. Types of passages Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are neither scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of both scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include fragmentsScofield, p. xvi. of scenes or sequels and passages of narration, description, or exposition. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the problem-solving passage, common in mystery and detective stories.Klaassen, p. 81-82. Types of scenes Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a climax scene). A scene may be classified by the fiction-writing mode that dominates its presentation (as in an action scene or a dialogue scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as flashback scenes and flashforward scenes).Klaassen, p. 23.

The mutineers, mostly ex-Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire rebels who had been integrated into the armed forces in 2011, were motivated by grievances about their pay and living conditions. Seizing control of nine cities throughout the country, they pressured the government to accept their demands, whereupon the mutiny ended. Smaller mutinies erupted on 17 January and 7 February, and another large-scale second mutiny broke out in May 2017.  History   6-8 January  UN peacekeepers were deployed to prevent an outbreak of large- scale combat during the mutinies. The revolt began around 2 a.m. on 6 January, when demobilised soldiers in Bouake, who demanded higher salaries and the payment of bonuses, seized weapons and ammunition at the local military base and police stations. They were soon joined by other, still active soldiers, who had served during ECOWAS mission in Liberia, but claimed to not have been paid for taking part in these operations. After some firefights, the mutineers secured Bouak√©, blockaded the city's entrances and told the local civilians to stay indoors. No further violence took place at Bouak√©, though the mutiny quickly spread to other cities. Soldiers revolted at Daloa's military base; according to some sources, there was a short firefight, while others say that the rebels only shot into the air. In either case, the situation quickly calmed down, with mutineers in full control of the town. A number of rogue soldiers also drove into Korhogo, which was seized without any resistance. Fighting was also reported at Daoukro and Odienn√©. Though the soldiers at the economic capital Abidjan initially remained calm, many of them also mutinied in the night, so that by the end of 6 January, the mutineers had taken control of five cities, including Abidjan. UN peacekeepers were deployed throughout the country to keep the situation from escalating, while defence minister Alain-Richard Donwahi said he would negotiate with the rebels at Bouak√© on the next day. Most of the revolting soldiers were former members of the Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire, a rebel movement which had controlled the northern part of the country until the Second Ivorian Civil War, after which they had been integrated into the regular armed forces. The outbreak of mutinies was also related to the power games at the head of the state: Guillaume Soro, the former spokesman of the rebellion, had just lost his position of second-to-the president man. By the next day, the revolt had spread to nine cities: Bouak√©, Abidjan, Odienn√©, Korhogo, Man, Daloa, Toul√©pleu, Abobo, and Daoukro. In Abidjan, the mutineers went on to take control of and then blockade the military headquarters including the defence ministry with makeshift barricades, and also reportedly attacked a military base belonging to loyalist paratrooper commandos. Fearing the violence could further escalate, Abidjan residents stocked up on food and water. Gunfire was also reported at Man and Bouak√©. Donwahi, along with Lt-Col Issiaka Ouattara, deputy commander of the loyalist Republican Guard, went to Bouak√© in the early afternoon to negotiate with the rebelling soldiers. They managed to reach a deal with the rebels, who promised to end the mutiny and return to their barracks in return for the promise of higher wages and bonuses. President Alassane Ouattara then went on to say on national television that an agreement had been reached, though criticized the soldiers for their actions: \\"I would like to say that this manner of making demands is not appropriate. It tarnishes the image of our country after all our efforts to revive the economy.\\" Despite this, a large group of mutineers remained unsatisfied with the deal. These rebels consequently opened fire on the house where the negotiations took place, and declared that they wanted their bonuses to be paid immediately instead of in the following week. A standoff ensued, with the government representatives, including the defence minister, effectively held hostage for several hours. Early on 8 January, however, the mutineers released all hostages. Though the contents of the agreement were not published, the soldiers were reportedly promised higher salaries as well as an amnesty for all mutineers.

In Bouake, the gendarmes also demanded to be included in the accord. In Yamoussoukro, four people were shot, including at least two mutineers killed by the Republican Guard.

At least eight civilians protesting against the mutiny were shot in Bouak√© and Korhogo. A demobilised mutineer was also killed on 14 May but the Republican Guard soldiers were reluctant to fight their former colleagues.

It tells the story of Mayotte's childhood and young adulthood, including her relationship with a white officer who ultimately abandons her in Martinique with their son. The 1948 publication of this novel made Cap√©cia the first woman of color to publish a book in France. In 1949, the novel was awarded the Grandprix litt√©raire des Antilles. Frantz Fanon strongly criticized the novel's treatment of black women's desire for white men in his 1952 book Black Skin, White Masks.  Plot   Part 1  The first part of the novel deals with Mayotte's childhood in the village of Carbet in Martinique. She is a mixed-race girl with a twin sister, Francette, although she is separated from her sister at an early age when Francette is sent to be raised by a childless aunt. Mayotte is an adventurous tomboy, and she is the leader of a mixed group of black, white, and metisse children from her school. Mayotte's gang spend their time exploring \\"the wildest and most dangerous places.\\" Mayotte is also friends with a washerwoman named Loulouze, who is several years older than her. Mayotte's first experience with a biracial relationship occurs vicariously through Loulouze's descriptions of her white lover and the gifts he gives her. The relationship ultimately results in a pregnancy and Loulouze's expulsion from her father's house. She flees to Fort-de-France. When examined for Confirmation, Mayotte fails and is obliged to take classes with the village priest, a handsome white man with whom she falls in love. He is kind to her and occasionally betrays awareness of her childhood crush. Her feelings for the priest inspire her to devote extra time after school to the catechism, so that she can be confirmed. The majority of part one focuses on Mayotte's parents and her respective relationships with them. Mayotte's father is a local politician and cock fighter. He is stingy, except when hosting parties for his politician friends. He is also a veteran of the First World War, and Mayotte's mother explains to her daughter that the war changed him for the worse. Mayotte's mother is a mixed-race woman, with a white mother. This is unusual, because most mixed- race children are the result of a union between a white man and a black woman. The discovery of her grandmother's whiteness pleases Mayotte immensely. Mayotte's childhood comes to an end with the death of her mother. She becomes mistress of her father's house, and her responsibilities increase as her father grows preoccupied with chasing young women. Eventually, he marries Renelise, a young girl only a couple of years older than Mayotte. Against the backdrop of her father's tumultuous relationship with her new stepmother, Mayotte explores love and sex with her boyfriend, Horace, a black man that she describes as \\"the most handsome specimen of what is considered Martinican.\\" Eventually, Mayotte grows fed up with her father's continued infidelity, both to her mother's memory and to his new wife. She runs away to Fort-de-France where her friend Loulouze helps her get a job and a place to stay. The first part ends with Mayotte attending Carnival and experiencing the attractions of a big city for the first time.  Part 2  The second part begins in medias res with Mayotte living with a white officer named Andre. She then goes back to describe her separation from Horace, which she explains by saying: \\"Memories of my father caused me to spurn what my heart craved - physical love.\\" She gives an account of her own rise in the world, from a worker in a sewing workroom to proprietress of her own laundering business. The bulk of this section, which is significantly shorter than Part 1, is given to a non- chronological account of her relationship with Andre. From the beginning, they both acknowledge that the relationship is necessarily temporary. Mayotte affirms that \\"white men do not marry black women,\\" while Andre speaks extensively of the white woman he met and fell in love with in Algiers. Additionally, Mayotte is not accepted in his social circles because of her race. Just after Mayotte becomes pregnant, the political situation separates her from Andre for good. Andre is an officer for Admiral Robert's pro-Vichy forces, so after the revolt which pushes Robert out of Martinique, Andre is evacuated to Guadalupe with the rest of the soldiers. Mayotte tries to follow him with their son, but she is denied a visa by French colonial officers because of official concern about the seriousness of their relationship. She does eventually make it to Guadalupe by borrowing her sister's identity, but by that time, Guadalupe was also in revolt and Andre was gone. Andre sends her a final letter saying goodbye and making it clear that he never intends to return to her or see his son. Mayotte wishes to tear up the check that arrives with this letter, but she cashes it, because she needs the money to raise her son. Andre's abandonment of her leads her to return home to her father's house and reconcile with him. The people of her hometown, including her sister, are disturbed by her son's whiteness and regard her as a traitor to her race. After her father's death, she resolves to move to Paris in hopes of finding a white man who will marry her.  Authorship   Autobiography  I Am a Martinican Woman is Cap√©cia's first book. It was published in France in 1948. Even before the author's identity was well known, there was a question of whether the text was intended to be autobiographical. The scholar E. Anthony Hurley does not assume that the text is meant to be autobiographical, instead writing that ‚ÄúCapecia‚Äôs use of a first-person narrator with the same name, Mayotte, as the author, invites identification between narrator and author and imposes a personal testimonial value on the narrative which invests it with a special authority.‚Äù Maryse Cond√© argues that Frantz Fanon's lack of consideration of the problem of authorship of the text limits his critique, because he \\"deliberately confuses the author and the object of her fiction. Although Mayotte says je, nothing proves that she was writing about herself.\\" In 1995, Beatrice Stith Clark discovered that Cap√©cia was a pseudonym for Lucette Ceranus. The details of Ceranus' life differ significantly from those of her fictional creation. For example, the depiction of nuclear family life in the novel is fictitious - Ceranus' parents were not married and her father did not acknowledge her or her twin sister until shortly before his death. Additionally, she had three children whose fathers are unknown, and she left them behind in Martinique when she went to Paris, only coming back to fetch them after earning money through the publication of her novel. Her twin sister, Reine, is also different from Francette in the novel. Francette ends the novel as a nun, while Reine actually went to Paris with Ceranus, and raised her children after her death. Ceranus did have a relationship with a French sailor named Andre, who left her just before the birth of their son. Omise‚Äôeke Natasha Tinsley reports that: \\"In response to Lucette‚Äôs unanswered requests for child support, he sent her a small sum and, in 1944, a copy of the memoirs of his stay in Martinique.\\"  Multiple authors  Omise‚Äôeke Natasha Tinsley calls the book \\"a multi-authored\\" text because she claims that ghostwriters helped Cap√©cia write the first part of the book, which describes Mayotte's childhood. Tinsley also claims that the second half of the book is a rewriting of the memoirs sent by Andre to Cap√©cia, after he departed Martinique for the last time to go to Algeria. For Tinsley, the number of authors involved in creating the text is significant, because it undercuts the title's claim to be the words of a Martinican woman.  Fanon's critique   Black Skin, White Masks  In the second chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, entitled \\"The Woman of Color and the White Man,\\" Frantz Fanon critiques Cap√©cia's I Am a Martinican Woman and psychoanalyzes the author through her text. Fanon writes: \\"For me, all circumlocution is impossible: Je suis Martiniquaise is cut-rate merchandise, a sermon in praise of corruption.\\" He views the relationship between Mayotte and Andre as extremely lopsided, with Mayotte giving everything and receiving nothing in return, \\"except a bit of whiteness in her life.\\" He describes Mayotte's conception of the world as \\"Manichean,\\" split between that which is white and therefore good, and that which is black and therefore evil and bad. Because of this, Fanon believes that Mayotte, like all Martinican women, is working deliberately for the dilution of the black race through sexual relations with white men. He writes that, \\"the race must be whitened; every woman in Martinique knows this, says it, repeats it. Whiten the race, save the race. ... Every women in the Antilles, whether in a casual flirtation or in a serious affair, is determined to select the least black of the men.\\" This attitude, according to Fanon, reflects a profound self-hatred.  Response to Fanon  Gwen Bergner argues that Black Skin, White Masks only considers women in terms of their sexual relationships with men. Therefore, interracial relationships between black women and white men are viewed as simply another sign of colonial domination of the black man. Therefore, Bergner argues that \\"Fanon‚Äôs scathing condemnation of black women‚Äôs desire in the second chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, ‚Äúis illustrative, in part, of his own desire to circumscribe black women‚Äôs sexuality and economic authority in order to ensure the patriarchal authority of black men.\\" Bergner highlights Fanon's analysis of Cap√©cia's job as a laundress as emblematic of her concerns with his critique. She argues that, by assuming that Cap√©cia is a laundry woman because she wants to continue the process of bleaching her life, Fanon ignores the economic reality of mid-twentieth century Martinique, where employment opportunities for women outside of laundry work or prostitution were limited. Thus, Bergner writes that Fanon \\"sees women‚Äôs economic and sexual choices as emanating from some psychic dimension of the erotic that is disconnected from material reality.\\" David Macey provides a different explanation for Fanon's antipathy towards Cap√©cia. Macey believes that Fanon's dislike was rooted at least partially in political motives, because Cap√©cia expresses support for the pro- Vichy government of Admiral Robert and denigrates the Martinican volunteers who overthrew Robert. Fanon was one of those volunteers. Maryse Cond√© writes that Fanon unfairly expects Cap√©cia to be more than a product of her time and to rise above the difficult racial relations and alienation that were inevitably experienced by people in that time. Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley argues that Fanon focuses entirely on the latter half of the novel, which was largely adapted from Andre's memoirs, ignoring the longer first half, which is about Mayotte's youth and which particularly highlights her relationships with multiple Black and mixed race women. Cheryl Duffus writes that, \\"it is easy to see why Fanon reacted so strongly to the novel: in light of Fanon‚Äôs work and of the postwar popularity of negritude, Je suis Martiniquaise appears to be a throwback to an earlier unenlightened age.\\" At the same time, she argues that Cap√©cia intended the novel's politics to be retrogressive, in order to mirror the jolt experienced by Mayotte in the novel, as her mixed race status and sexual relationship with a white man, formerly indicators of a successful life, suddenly became liabilities in the changing atmosphere of the postwar era, amid the rising public commitment to Negritude.  Literary criticism   Feminist readings  Maryse Cond√© claims that Cap√©cia's work is invaluable from a feminist perspective, because it provides \\"a precious written testimony, the only one that we possess, of the mentality of a West Indian girl in those days.\\" Cond√© also writes that Cap√©cia's work is undervalued, not because of her lack of writing skills, but because of the displeasure experienced by society at large when a woman speaks out beyond the accepted boundaries assigned to her. Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert argues that the focus on race in traditional readings of Cap√©cia's work has served to \\"obscure those aspects of the text that which place [her] at the forefront of the development of feminist literature in Guadalupe and Martinique.‚Äù For Paravisni-Gebert, one such aspect is Cap√©cia's expressed desire for economic independence, which manifests itself both in her running of a successful laundering business and her determination to only form romantic attachments with men who can support her. Cheryl Duffus writes that I Am a Martinican Woman and Cap√©cia's second novel, The White Negress, are similar in their treatment of the protagonists' rejection by their communities for bearing white men's sons. To Duffus, not only does this rejection mirror Cap√©cia's own rejection by Fanon, but it also serves as \\"a critique of Negritude and of the gendered double standard so often seen in community-identity politics.\\" E. Anthony Hurley views Mayotte's character as a deliberate refutation of misogynist stereotypes of women. In particular, Hurley highlights the juxtaposition of Mayotte and her twin, because the many differences between the two, despite their genetic similarities, ‚Äú[negate] generalization about [Mayotte's] life and identity choices as a woman and [free] her to act contrary to the role prescribed for her by the ideological system of a Fanon.‚Äù  Queer theory  Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley's reading of the texts highlights the narrator's fascination with other women's nude bodies, particularly in the first half of the novel, before Mayotte reaches adulthood. Tinsley describes the differences between the halves as a shift from an adolescent desire for fellow Martinican women to a desire for white men in adulthood, because of the white man's ability to provide both economic mobility for the narrator and an attractive audience surrogate for Cap√©cia's French readers. According to Tinsley, the homosexual desires latent in the text were disguised to make the novel more palatable, since Cap√©cia needed the money to become reunited with her children. Yolanda Martinez-San Miguel analyzes the novel through Manolo Guzm√°n's framework of heteroracial erotics, which hypothesizes that the white heteronormative couple is predicated on the quasi-homoerotic desire to marry someone who is like the self, because there is a drive to marry within one's own race. Using this framework, Martinez-San Miguel argues that Cap√©cia's ultimate move to France at the end of the novel is a self-imposed exile that comes out of her suppression of her own homosocial desire for Martinican men and her desire to break the mold by pursuing a heteroracial relationship.  Rejection of interracial relationships  E. Anthony Hurley argues that the novel ultimately argues that \\"transcultural love is unsatisfying and unsatisfactory,\\" because Mayotte's adolescent relationship with Horace, a black Martinican, is described in extremely positive terms, whereas the sexual aspects of her relationship with Andre are described in part as unsatisfactory and all her encounters with him end with a question. Additionally, her choice of a white man as a sexual partner is, according to Hurley, based more on her desire to access his societal power than on positive feelings of desire, such as those which drive her to seek a relationship with Horace.  In conversation with other texts  In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon compares Cap√©cia to Nini, the titular character in Abdoulaye Sadji's novel, Nini. Fanon also psychoanalyzes Nini in \\"The Woman of Color and the White Man,\\" because she rejects the possibility of a relationship with a black man, which Fanon views as a similar pathology to what he perceives as Cap√©cia's fetishization of white men. E. Anthony Hurley writes that I Am a Martinican Woman is in close conversation with D‚Äôune rive a l‚Äôautre by Marie-Magdeleine Carbet: \\"each text supports the other, intersecting and combining to provide a framework within which the complexity of the Martinican woman manifests itself.\\" Maryse Cond√© compares Cap√©cia to another West Indian writer, Suzanne Lacascade, because she believes that both writers enraged men by speaking out through their novels and expressing their own realities in a way that was not subordinate to Caribbean men. Paravisni-Gebert includes Cap√©cia as one of three women responsible for starting the development of feminist literature in Martinique and Guadalupe; the other two women are Michele Lacrosil and Jacqueline Manicom. Madeleine Cottenet-Hage and Kevin Meehan speculate that Lacrosil, in particular, deliberately mirrors the plot of I Am a Martinican Woman in her novel Sapotille and the Clay Canary, in order to respond to Fanon's critique by showing that there are no opportunities for Caribbean women in the thirties other than the life choices that bothered Fanon in Cap√©cia's work. In Maryse Cond√©'s novel Heremakhonon (1976), the protagonist, Veronica, thinks about the fact that she has never had a sexual relationship with a black man, but protests in her internal monologue that \\"[she is] no Mayotte Cap√©cia. No!\\" On the other hand, Eileen Ketchum McEwan considers Veronica and Mayotte to be the same type of protagonist, because they are both engaged in a \\"narcissistic quest\\" to fall in love with men that reflect the self-image they would like to have of themselves. McEwan sees both as descendants of the titular character in Madame de La Fayette's Princess of Cleves.  References  * Curry, Ginette.

Two types of inhibitory receptor superfamily members are immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing receptors and their non-ITIM-bearing, activating counterparts. Control of cell signaling via SHP-1 is thought to occur through a balance between PILRalpha-mediated inhibition and PILRbeta-mediated activation. These paired immunoglobulin-like receptor genes are located in a tandem head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 7.

The novel is set in the early part of the reign of Henry VIII, and explores the possible consequences had the Tudors been overthrown by a rightful descendant of Edward III. Plot The action of the novel takes place in the country west of Oxford during the 1536 Pilgrimage of Grace, an uprising against Henry VIII. Peter Pentecost, a young monastic scholar, is informed by shadowy figures who are plotting to depose the king that he is the legitimate son of the deceased Duke of Buckingham and that, as the last of the Bohun line, he has a claim to the English throne. Although his true identity must for now remain secret, Peter finds himself being prepared for his intended kingly role and being tutored in the noble pursuits of swordsmanship and archery. He meets a noblewoman, Sabine Beauforest. To hide from the king‚Äôs men, Peter takes to the greenwood where he is aided by Solomon Darking and his vagabond comrades. They introduce him to the lore of the countryside, and reveal the existence of an entirely self-contained outlaw society, invisible to the agents of the state, with its own system of communication and intelligence gathering. He discovers that ‚Äòunder the blanket of the dark all men are alike and all are nameless'. As the novel progresses, Peter realises he is having increasing doubts about the venture he is being asked to undertake, and the motives of those behind it: ‚ÄúThey claimed to stand for the elder England and its rights, and the old Church, but at their heart they stood only for themselves.‚Äù After an encounter with the king himself, Peter asks himself whether there ‚Äúmight not there be a world of light under the blanket of the dark?‚Äù, and he decides that he does not wish to pursue a life of power. He disappears from official sight back into the greenwood with Sabine.  Critical reception David Daniell in The Interpreter's House (1975) quotes Kipling who professed to be \\"rested and delighted\\" by the book and who called it a tour de force. Rose Macaulay said that the book was \\"so enchanting and beautiful that I often read it for my pleasure\\". Daniell himself notes that while the tone is relaxed, the control is tight, and \\"it is as if Buchan is drawing together all his skills under the influence of his response to the land and its people\\". Writing for the John Buchan Society website in 2001, Kenneth Hillier called The Blanket of the Dark ‚Äúa thoroughly enjoyable book, because it not only expresses the deep love Buchan had for his adopted countryside but it conveys great empathy with the period in which it is set‚Äù. David Goldie noted in 2009 that \\"One of the animating ideas of The Blanket of the Dark is that English values are expressed more profoundly in the quiet wisdom of its folk than in the forceful actions of its rulers\\". In 2019, the historian Diarmaid MacCulloch called it a \\"wonderful young adult book\\", also describing it as \\"chilling\\" and \\"brilliant\\".

In his anger, and having discovered Sir Frank and George's secret, Tom soon turns to blackmail to get his revenge. At a time when homosexuality was illegal, Sir Frank will do almost anything to avoid discovery.  Productions  A chamber version of the musical premiered at the Lowry Studio in Salford, Greater Manchester in January 2011 before transferring to the King's Head Theatre in London for 4 weeks. A full-scale re-worked version of the musical was staged in 2013 and toured the UK for three months. The musical mounted subsequent productions for UK tours in 2014, 2015 and 2016. In 2017, a London season was mounted at The Vaults, Waterloo. The musical transferred to The Hippodrome Casino for its West End premiere in March 2018.  Reception  Reviews for the King's Head Theatre production in 2011 were critical of the musical's dialogue while generally positive about the songs. Charles Spencer, writing in the Daily Telegraph of the 2011 performance, was critical of the script and called it a \\"deeply flawed production\\" While Michale Billington in the Guardian gave it two out of five stars, saying that \\"Bugg's songs are better than his book.\\" Paul Vale, writing for The Stage, wrote that \\"Bugg‚Äôs music and lyrics are strong but his direction lacks perspective\\" Reviews for the subsequent re-worked full-scale versions of the musical have been far more positive. West End Wilma gave the show five out of five stars, describing it as ‚Äúa brilliantly well written show, with a hilarious script and wonderful songs. The serious subject matter is perfectly balanced with hilarious comedy.‚Äù Libby Purves, writing in Theatre Cat, gave the production four out of five stars, describing Bugg's songs as \\"wonderful\\". Writing for Psychologies Magazine, Danielle Woodward, described Miss Nightingale as \\"an entertaining night out at the theatre\\" saying \\"the show holds your interest and attention from beginning to end, there are laughs and tears, great choreography and costumes.\\" Chris Selman, writing in Gay Times, gave the show four out of five stars calling it ‚Äúa really great night out\\" with \\"wonderful performances, brilliant songs and a wickedly funny sense of humour.\\" A poll in 2016 organised by BritishTheatre.com to find The 100 Greatest Musicals of All Time saw Miss Nightingale - the musical voted in at number 80 by members of the public. BritishTheatre.com Editor-in-chief Douglas Mayo said, \\"One of the great things that happen when you open a vote like this to the public is that you find out about a musical like Miss Nightingale. Written by composer Matthew Bugg, and has toured the UK receiving critical acclaim and raves from audiences.\\" The show was also included in the Guardian Readers' favourite stage shows of 2016] for the performances at Theatre Royal, Margate. It was nominated by Guardian reader Philip Bray who described it as, \\"A touching tale, beautifully and originally told. Being a musical not based on a book or a film, or a film of a book, made it even more captivating.\\"  References  External links * 2011 musicals Original musicals British musicals ","title":"Miss Nightingale"},{"id":"52831694","text":"The Women's Doubles tournament at the 1970 French Open was held from 25 May to 7 June 1970 on the outdoor clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France.

Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine has been for years in the center of scientific interest as a stable intermediate in chemical nitrogen fixation (i. e. the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen N2 into organic substrates under normal conditions).  Production  Early attempts to prepare tris(trimethylsilyl)amine from ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane (TMS-Cl) were unsuccessful even at temperatures of 500 ¬∞C and in the presence of the base pyridine. The reaction of ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane stops at the stage of the doubly silylated product bis(dimethylsilyl)amine (usually referred to as hexamethyldisilazane, HMDS). Synthese von Hexamethyldisilazan (HMDS) Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine is obtained by reaction of the sodium salt of hexamethyldisilazane - from hexamethyldisilazane and sodium amide or from hexamethyldisilazane, sodium and styrene  with trimethylchlorosilane in 80% yield. :\\\\begin{matrix}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{[(CH3)3Si]2NH ->[+\\\\ce{NaNH2}][-\\\\ce{NH3}] NaN[Si(CH3)3]2 ->[+\\\\ce{ClSi(CH3)3}][-\\\\ce{NaCl}] N[Si(CH3)3]3}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\end{matrix} The lithium salt of hexamethyldisilazane - from hexamethyldisilazane and butyllithium or from hexamethyldisilazane and phenyllithium  reacts with trimethylchlorosilane only in yields of 50-60% to tris(trimethylsilyl)amine. The reaction of lithium nitride with trimethylchlorosilane can be carried out as a one-pot reaction in THF with 72% yield. :Li3N + 3Me3SiCl -> N(Me3Si)3 + 3LiCl  Properties  Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine is a colorless, crystalline or waxy solid which is stable to water and bases. Alcohols or acids though cleave the Si-N-bond under formation of ammonia.  Applications   Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine as a synthetic building block  From antimony trichloride and tris(trimethylsilyl)amine, a nitridoantimone cubane-type cluster can be formed almost quantitatively at ‚Äì60 ¬∞C. Ketones can be trifluoromethylated in the presence of P4-t-Bu and nonamethyltrisilazane under mild conditions in yields of up to 84% with the inert fluoroform (HCF3, HFC-23). The monomer trichloro(trimethylsilyl)-phosphoranimine Cl3P=NSiMe3 is formed from tris(trimethylsilyl)amine and phosphorus pentachloride in hexane at 0 ¬∞C, Synthese von Trichlor(trimethylsilyl)phosphoranimin which can be polymerized to linear polydichlorophosphazenes with defined molecular weights and polydispersities. The cyclic trimer (NPCl2)3 hexachlorocyclotriphosphane is predominantly formed from tris(trimethylsilyl)amine and phosphorus pentachloride in boiling dichloromethane (about 40 ¬∞C) among other oligomers which gives upon heating over 250 ¬∞C high molecular weight, little defined polydichlorophosphazenes. Synthese von Hexachlorcyclotriphosphan Nitrogen trifluoride NF3 (which is used, inter alia, for the plasma etching of silicon wafers) is obtainable from tris(trimethylsilyl)amine and fluorine at ‚Äì40 ¬∞C in acetonitrile, suppressing the formation of nitrogen and tetrafluorohydrazine, which are produced as undesirable by-products during the standard synthesis of nitrogen trifluoride from ammonia or ammonium fluoride. Synthese von NF3  Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine intermediate in chemical nitrogen fixation  The technical nitrogen fixation was made possible by the Haber-Bosch process, in which nitrogen is converted into ammonia by reductive protonation in the presence of iron catalysts under high pressures (> 150 bar) and temperatures (> 400 ¬∞C). In chemical nitrogen fixation (i.e., the transformation of atmospheric nitrogen under normal conditions into reactive starting materials for chemical syntheses, usually also ammonia), tris(trimethylsilyl)amine plays an important role in the so-called reductive silylation, since it is hydrolyzed with water to ammonia. :\\\\ce{ {N2} + {6e^-} ->[\\\\ce{Catalyst:}\\\\ \\\\ce{Mo},\\\\ \\\\ce{Fe},\\\\ \\\\ce{Co}]} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\ce{->[\\\\ce{H+}]} &\\\\ce{2NH3}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{->[\\\\ce{R3Si-X}][-\\\\,\\\\ce{X-}]} &\\\\ce{2N(SiR3)3} \\\\end{cases} As early as 1895 it was observed that metallic lithium reacts with nitrogen to lithium nitride at room temperature.

He was the head of the Ma'n family, whose emirs controlled the Chouf from 1120. He is credited by an inscription for building a mosque in Deir al-Qamar in 1493. He was briefly imprisoned by the Mamluk authorities in 1505 in relation to his alliance with the Bani al-Hansh clan against the Mamluk-appointed, Druze governor of Beirut. Until modern research by Kamal Salibi most modern historians, including Salibi initially, based their information about Fakhr al-Din on the 19th-century works of local historian Haydar al-Shihabi, who confused him with his grandson, Qurqumaz ibn Yunis, and placed his death in 1544. Family origins From 1120, the Chouf mountains in southern Mount Lebanon were controlled by the emirs of the Ma'n family, including Fakhr al- Din The Ma'n family, to which Fakhr al-Din belonged, established itself in the Chouf (Shuf) area in southern Mount Lebanon, where they founded their headquarters at Baaqlin, in 1120.Harris 2012, pp. 59, 78. The progenitor of the family had fought against the Crusaders near Antioch and was sent to Mount Lebanon by the Muslim Burid emirs of Damascus to reinforce the position of the Tanukhids in the Gharb area (around Aley) against the Crusaders in Beirut. They formed marital ties with the Tanukhids and were assisted by the Tanukhid emir Buhtur in building permanent dwellings. Sources and identification Artistic rendition of Fakhr al-Din appearing before Sultan Selim I in 1516. Modern historians have shown that this meeting did not occur as Fakhr al-Din died in 1506. One of his descendants, Qurqumaz, rebelled and was temporarily in Selim's custody in 1518. Modern sources largely derive information about the Ma'nid period in Mount Lebanon preceding the rule of Fakhr al-Din ibn Qurqumaz (Fakhr al-Din II) from the 19th-century works of Haydar al-Shihabi (d. 1835) and Tannus al-Shidyaq (d. 1861).Salibi 1973, p. 273 Al-Shihabi and al-Shidyaq chronicle a Ma'nid emir named Fakhr al-Din ibn Uthman, who was also referred to by historians as Fakhr al-Din I to distinguish him from his descendant Fakhr al-Din ibn Qurqumaz.Salibi 1973, p. 273‚Äì274. According to al- Shihabi the emir was recognized as the preeminent Druze emir (prince or commander) of Mount Lebanon by the Ottoman sultan Selim I upon his conquest of Damascus in 1517 and that he died in 1544.Salibi 1973, p. 274. According to research by the modern historian Kamal Salibi, Fakhr al-Din I's actual name was \\"Fakhr al-Din Uthman\\" and he died in 1506, the year 1544 having seemingly been \\"chosen at random\\" by al-Shihabi. The figure of Fakhr al-Din I that historians, including Peter Malcolm Holt, Phillip Hitti, Henri Lammens, Ferdinand Wustenfeld, and Salibi himself in his article on \\"Fakhr al-Din\\" in the Encyclopedia of Islam,Salibi, 1973, p. 276. acknowledged was actually Emir Qurqumaz, who died in 1586. Salibi attributes the historical mistake to al- Shihabi's work. The historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth writes that Salibi \\"convincingly argues that the Fakhr al-Din I (b.) Uthman who is supposed to have submitted to the Ottoman Sultan Selim the Grim in 1517 at Damascus and to have been confirmed in the chieftainship of the Jebel Druze [Mount Lebanon], cannot have been reigning at that time\\".Bosworth 2006, p. 68, note 123. Biography Fakhreddine Mosque in Deir al-Qamar, built by Fakhr al-Din in 1493 According to Salibi, Fakhr al-Din was the first Ma'nid \\"whose historicity is beyond question\\".Salibi 1991, p. 343. He ruled the Chouf in the late Mamluk period (1260‚Äì1517) until his death in August/September 1506, a decade before the Ottoman conquest. The chronicle of the local Druze chronicler Ibn Sibat (d. 1520) indicates that Fakhr al-Din's given name was Uthman, while \\"Fakhr al-Din\\" was a laqab (honorific) meaning \\"pride of the faith\\".Salibi, 1973, p. 277. Ibn Sibat referred to him as the \\"emir of the Chouf in the region of Sidon\\" who died in 1506. A 1493 inscription on a mosque in Deir al-Qamar credits \\"al-Maqarr al-Fakhri [the Fakhrid Seat] Emir Fakhr al-Din Uthman\\" as its builder and further notes that he was the \\"son of al-Hajj Yunis ibn Ma'n\\". Both Fakhr al-Din and his father lived during the era of the prominent Druze reformer Jamal al-Din Abdullah al-Tanukhi (d. 1479), who urged his coreligionists to engage in Muslim religious practices, hence the usage of the honorary title al-Hajj (one who has completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca) by Yunis and the construction of a mosque, which were not used by the Druze, by Fakhr al-Din.Salibi 2005, p. 123. According to the historian William Harris, in the 1490s Fakhr al-Din entered into an alliance with the Bani al-Hansh, a Sunni Muslim clan that controlled most of the Beqaa Valley at the time. The Bani al-Hansh were at war with the Buhturids (descendants of Jumayhur Buhtur) led by Jamal al-Din Hajji, the Mamluk-appointed governor of Beirut between the 1490s and 1512.Harris 2012, p. 78. In July 1496 he was summoned with other Syrian chieftains to Damascus by its viceroy Qansuh al-Yahyawi, according to the Damascene chronicler al-Busrawi (d. 1500), for unclear reasons. The chronicles of the Damascene chroniclers Ibn al-Himsi (d. 1527) and Ibn Tulun (d. 1546) hold that in the following year, he joined the rebellion of the Mamluk officer Aqbirdi when the latter besieged Damascus; Aqbirdi died of natural causes in 1498 and Fakhr al-Din was imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus with other Syrian chieftains on 17 April 1499 for their participation in the rebellion.Hourani 2010, p. 918. Fakhr al-Din was imprisoned by the Mamluk authorities in 1505, the year the Bani al-Hansh raided Jamal al-Din's soap stockpiles in Beirut. The Mamluks nonetheless held him in high esteem and he was released shortly after \\"covered with honor\\", according to al-Shidyaq. The latter remarked on Fakhr al-Din's emergence as \\"the sun setting on the Tanukh [Buhturid] emirate and rising on the Ma'n emirate\\". Succession Genealogical tree of the Ma'n dynasty Fakhr al-Din was succeeded by his son Yunis, who according to Ibn Sibat died \\"a young man of reverence, power, and dignity\\" in 1511-12.Salibi, 1973, p. 278. Although Shihabi claimed that a certain \\"Fakhr al-Din ibn Uthman\\" was summoned by Sultan Selim I upon his conquest of Mamluk Syria in 1517, the 17th-century Maronite patriarch and historian Istifan al-Duwayhi wrote that it was \\"Emir Qurqumaz son of Emir Yunis ibn Ma'n\\" who was actually summoned. Salibi considers it plausible that Yunis, the father of Qurqumaz, was the son of Fakhr al-Din Uthman as it conformed with a widespread Arab tradition in which the eldest son names his eldest son after his father. The chronicle of Duwayhi indicates that Qurqumaz succeeded Yunis and continued to hold the emirate of the Chouf in 1528, though it contains no information about the Chouf emirate between then and 1586, when Shihabi and Shidyaq hold Qurqumaz died (Duwayhi places his death in 1584). In the assessment of Salibi, Shihabi likely erred in the reconstruction of the Ma'nid family due to the exceptionally long reign of Qurqumaz (1511‚Äì1586).Salibi 1973, p. 280. Salibi surmises that Qurqumaz succeeded his father while a young child and must have been assisted in ruling the emirate by his close Ma'nid kinsman Alam al-Din Sulayman (likely an uncle or cousin), who was mentioned by Ibn Sibat as having been imprisoned relatively briefly with Qurqumaz by Janbirdi al-Ghazali, the Ottoman governor of Damascus, in 1518.Salibi 1973, pp. 280‚Äì281.

Biography Delorme was born on September 10, 1876 in Lun√©ville, France into an upper middle class family. Her father, Edmond Delorme, was a military doctor and would later found the museum of Lun√©ville. She showed an early interest in art. Her early paintings depicted themes of the family environment. She also found inspirations in Brittany where she spent the summer with the Merson family. She studied under Rapha√´l Collin, Paul Leroy and Luc-Olivier Merson in their private workshops, but was unable to enter the Ecole de Beaux Artes which at the time did not accept female artists. In 1897, Delorme became a member of the Soci√©taire des Artistes Fran√ßais where she exhibited her paintings, winning Honorable Mention in 1897 and Medal of Third Class in 1901. In 1905, she won a scholarship which allowed her to travel to Italy. This trip introduced her to different light conditions which had an influence on her style. During the first world war, Delorme began painting the Senegalese riflemen encountered in the \\"wintering camps\\". These works were presented in 1921 and she won the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique Prize. Following this, she found inspiration in North African themes by travelling Morocco, where she journeyed around the entire country painting scenes of everyday life. Delorme died July 26, 1946 in Lille, France. Her work has been in the public domain since January 1, 2017. Legacy In 2013 the Mus√©e du ch√¢teau des Lumi√®res held a retrospective of Delorme's work.

Al-Makzun was well-educated in Arabic poetry and Shia Islam. Descended from a line of emirs of Sinjar, he succeeded his father as emir of the town in 1205. Many Alawites from Sinjar migrated to the mountains around Latakia during the time of his father. The Alawites of these mountains later appealed for al-Makzun's intervention amid their struggles with the Kurds and Nizari Ismailis. Al- Makzun led an expedition to relieve the Alawites after many were massacred in the Sahyun fortress. Between 1218 and 1222, he and his sons captured the forts of Abu Qubays, which became al-Makzun's seat of power, al-Marqab, al-Ulayqa and Baarin. He ultimately drove out most of the Kurds and Ismailis from the mountains, consolidating the Alawite presence. In the following years, he penned a number of Alawite religious books. Sources For some time, information about al-Makzun used by modern-day historians came solely from Muhammad Amin Ghalib al-Tawil's Ta ærƒ´kh al- øAlawiyyƒ´n (History of the Alawites), published in Latakia in 1966.Friedman 2010, p. 51 However, a more detailed and sourced biography of al-Makzun, Ta ærƒ´kh al-Makz≈´n, was penned by the Alawite sheikh Yunus Hasan Ramadan in 1913. The latter based his biography on several manuscripts, all held in the private libraries of Alawite sheikhs.Friedman 2010, p. 51, n. 198. These manuscripts largely dated to the 18th century, though one dated to the 17th century and three others were written in the 15th century. One of the manuscripts was written by a supposed descendant of al-Makzun. The only mention of him in non-Alawite medieval sources comes from Majma' al-Adab fi Mu'jam al-Alqab, a biographical dictionary of Ibn al-Fuwati (1244‚Äì1323), a director of the Mustansiriyyah Library in Baghdad.Winter 2016, pp. 38‚Äì39. Life Origins and education Al-Hasan al-Makzun was born in 1188 or 1193 and traced his descent to a certain Arab emir of Sinjar called Ra'iq ibn Khidr; the latter was a contemporary of the paramount Alawite scholar, al-Khasibi (d. 969), and belonged to the tribes of Banu Tarkhan and Banu Fadl, both of which had Yemeni origins.Friedman 2010, p. 52 He was well-educated in Arabic poetry and Shia Islam, and memorized the Nahj al-balƒÅgha, a collection of speeches by Ali, considered by Shia Muslims to be the first Imam. Al-Makzun's father, Yusuf, followed his ancestor's footsteps as emir of Sinjar, and al-Makzun likewise succeeded Yusuf when the latter died in 1205. During Yusuf's days, a wave of Alawite migration from Jabal Sinjar to the coastal mountains surrounding Latakia in Syria took place. The migration was led by a local sheikh, Ahmad ibn Jabir ibn Abi'l-'Arid, founder of the Banu'l-'Arid clan, which later became patrons of the Alawites in the Latakia mountains. At the same time, there were Alawite migrations from Baghdad, Anah and Aleppo to this same region. Intervention in the Latakia mountains Al-Makzun captured the fortress of Abu Qubays (pictured) and made it his headquarters in Syria In 1218, the Alawites of the mountains near Latakia and Baniyas appealed to al- Makzun to assist them in their struggles against the Nizari Ismaili Shias, who controlled an extensive network of fortresses in these mountains, and the Kurdish military settlers brought to the region by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin. A massacre of Alawites in the Sahyun fortress while they were celebrating Nowruz prompted al-Makzun to lead a 25,000-strong expedition from Sinjar to relieve the Alawites. This first campaign reportedly ended with a defeat against the Kurdish and Ismaili forces. He later returned to Sinjar to gather more troops, swelling his forces to 50,000 warriors, and returned to the Latakia region in 1222. Al-Makzun captured the fortress of Abu Qubays, which became his base, while his son captured the village of Baarin. He also seized the castles of al-Marqab and al-Ulayqa. Afterward, he celebrated his conquests with the Alawite peasants, married his cousin Fadda, and assigned iq·π≠ƒÅ øƒÅt (fiefs) to her brothers.Friedman 2010, pp. 52‚Äì53. Al-Makzun ultimately drove out most of the Kurds and Nizaris from the mountains, according to his biographers.Friedman 2010, p. 53 Religious activities His military victories were followed by an intra-Alawite theological debate he organized against the followers of the Alawite scholars Ishaq and Abu Duhayba. After the debate's conclusion, he had the followers of Ishaq and Abu Duhayba killed and their books burned. Prior to that, in 1223, he penned the RisƒÅlat tazkiyat al- nafs. In 1232, he wrote a book of prayers called Ad øiya, which is not available to the public. Al-Makzun made significant innovations to the Alawite religious doctrine.Winter 2016, pp. 37‚Äì38. These included an apparent rejection of the taqiyya (dissimulation) concept, the institution of jihad as a duty of all believers, and criticism of excessive monist Sufi practices.Winter 2016, p. 38. According to Winter, these changes \\"suggested [sic] that his overall contribution be seen as that of 'secularizing' Alawi[te] society and incorporating it more clearly as a sectarian community\\". Death and legacy In 1240, he left for Sinjar, but became ill and died en route either at the village of Tal Afar near Mosul, or in Damascus where he is reportedly buried in the Kafr Sousa district. According to historian Stefan Winter, al-Makzun al-Sinjari \\"stands as perhaps the most prominent individual in 'Alawi history\\".Winter 2016, p. 37. Al-Makzun is considered an important mystical poet and theologian in Alawite tradition, and his works have been commented on by many later Alawite writers. Moreover, his campaigns in the Latakia mountains consolidated the position of the Alawites against their local competitors and helped to standardise the nascent Alawite faith.Winter 2016, p. 51. Finally, many of the Sinjari soldiers that came with al-Makzun ended up settling in the Latakia mountains, and according to Winter, their descendants make up several of the main tribal lineages among Alawites including the Haddadiya, the Matawira, the Muhalaba and the Numaylatiyya.Winter 2016, p. 40. Two of the main shrines in Abu Qubays are attributed to two descendants of al-Makzun, Shaykh Musa al-Rabti ibn Muhammad ibn Kawkab, and Shaykh Yusuf ibn Kawkab.

Yusuf or his family may have been Kurdish or Turkmen levends (tribal irregulars) from Marash and were established in Tripoli's vicinity by at least the 1510s‚Äì1520s. He became a multazim subordinate to the Assaf chieftains of the Keserwan for most of his career until his promotion to the rank of pasha and appointment as Tripoli's first beylerbey in 1579. Hostilities consequently ensued with the Assafs, ending with Yusuf's assassination of their last chieftain in 1591 and his confiscation of their tax farms. His takeover of the Keserwan and Beirut prompted his first confrontation with Fakhr al-Din II, the Druze chieftain and sanjakbey (district governor) of Sidon-Beirut in 1598. He was given command by the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government) over the armies of Syria to suppress the rebel Ali Janbulad of Aleppo in 1606. After a series of defeats at Hama, Tripoli and Damascus, he submitted to Janbulad at Krak des Chevaliers, though the rebellion was suppressed in 1607. Relations with the Ottomans deteriorated over the next ten years, a period in which Fakhr al-Din gained steady advantage over Yusuf, who was abandoned by most of his local allies and his nephews. To prevent Fakhr al-Din from gaining total control over Tripoli, the Porte reappointed Yusuf beylerbey in 1619. He remained under financial strain with large debts due to the Porte and owed to Fakhr al-Din, who gained control over most of the eyalet's districts. With his death in 1625, the Sayfas' power gradually dissipated and most of the family was exterminated by the Ottomans by the mid-17th century. Yusuf was noted by contemporary historians for his generosity and patronage of poets and Sufis, which contributed to his poor financial state. Neither he nor his family developed Tripoli or its eyalet, which declined economically in contrast to the thriving domains of Fakhr al-Din. Although he was viewed favorably by the Sunni Muslims of Tripoli and Akkar for his loyalty to the Ottomans, he was resented by the Maronite peasantry for executing unpopular and ruinous government measures. Origins The Sayfa family were conventionally considered to be Kurds based on the 19th-century, local chronicle of Tannus al-Shidyaq, though the 17th-century Maronite patriarch and historian Istifan al-Duwayhi referred to them as Turkmens. The modern historians Kamal Salibi and Abdul-Rahim Abu-Husayn concur that they were Turkmens in origin. Abu- Husayn notes that the Sayfas had been levends, citing the generally authoritative Ottoman historian Mustafa Naima (d. 1716). According to Naima, Yusuf hailed from Marash in the Anatolian‚ÄìSyrian borderlands and moved from there to Tripoli. The 16th-century Damascene historian and intimate of Yusuf, al-Hasan al-Burini, noted that the Sayfas were relatives of the Dulkadirids, a Marash-based Turkmen tribal dynasty. The modern historian Stefan Winter holds that the Sayfas were \\"most likely of Kurdish origin but affiliated with the Zulkadir [Dulkadirid] Turkmen confederation\\". Yusuf and his family, the Sayfas, were established in the hills of Akkar (pictured in 2015) Abu-Husayn surmises that the Sayfas may have arrived in Tripoli Sanjak during the dispersal of the Dulkadirids and their affiliates shortly before 1526 or shortly after their reestablishment that year. The sanjak was a subdivision of Damascus Eyalet spanning the Syrian coastlands from Latakia southward to Byblos and northern Mount Lebanon and the Alawite Mountains. The establishment of Turkmen and Kurdish military colonies around Tripoli started during Mamluk rule (mid-13th century‚Äì1516) to secure the strategic port city's mountainous hinterland and protect the roads connecting the Syrian coast with the major cities of the Syrian interior plains. The rugged ranges separating Tripoli from the Syrian interior, namely northern Mount Lebanon and the Alawite Mountains, were dominated by Catholic Maronites and the heterodox Muslim Alawites, two communities viewed with suspicion by the Sunni Muslim Mamluks and their Ottoman successors. Duwayhi places Yusuf in Tripoli or its vicinity in 1528. He was likely ten to twelve years old at the time. Although Abu- Husayn asserts that Yusuf was the first member of the Sayfa clan whose name is recorded in the sources, Ottoman tax records name a certain Muhammad Sayfa as the holder of timars (fiefs) in the subdistricts of Arqa, Batroun, Dinniyeh, Futuh Bani Rahhal, Akkar, Hisn al-Akrad, Manasif and Tartus, all in the Tripoli Sanjak, in 1519. Al-Shidyaq's chronicle records the name of Yusuf's father to be Muhammad. The tax records also indicate that a son of Muhammad Sayfa, Ibrahim, held timars in Arqa in 1534‚Äì1537 and 1548‚Äì1549; after Ibrahim's failure to report to the Baghdad front in the war with Safavid Iran in 1553, his timars were transferred to a certain Yusuf. Establishment in Akkar Yusuf was headquartered in the fortress village of Hisn Akkar (Gibelacar). He formed ties with the local multazims (tax farmers) upon moving to the area. Tax farming was the predominant mode of tax collection in Syria where districts and subdistricts were farmed out to local strongmen for limited terms in return for a fixed amount of money. From Hisn Akkar Yusuf controlled Jabal Akkar, the northernmost part of Mount Lebanon, and possibly the Homs Gap plain at Jabal Akkar's northeastern edge. He and his paternal kinsman Hasan were given joint control of a farm in Akkar by the authorities in 1571. The tax farms in Jabal Akkar were likely subleased to Yusuf from Mansur ibn Hasan, the head of the Turkmen Assaf dynasty. The Assaf multazims were headquartered from the 13th century in the village of Ghazir in the Keserwan area in central Mount Lebanon. Mansur leased the Jabal Akkar tax farm and other tax farms in the Tripoli Sanjak from Muhammad Agha Shu'ayb, the chieftain of a long-established military family based in the fortress of Arqa in the Akkar Plain, which had held the tax farms for all or part of the Tripoli region from 1523. Mansur may have encouraged Yusuf's establishment in Jabal Akkar to undermine the Shu'aybs by installing an ally in their vicinity. Conflict broke out soon afterward between the Sayfas and Shu'aybs in 1528 when the former withheld tax revenues from the latter. The Sayfa family, lacking the local power base of the Shu'aybs, consequently fled Akkar. They temporarily found refuge in Baruk under the protection of Qurqumaz ibn Yunis of the Ma'n dynasty, a long-established family of Druze chieftains and tax farmers who controlled the Chouf area in southern Mount Lebanon. Not long after their displacement, the Sayfas were assisted by Mansur, who had also owed Muhammad Agha taxes. The Sayfas, Assafs and Ma'ns assaulted against Arqa in 1528 and routed the Shu'aybs, while Mansur had Muhammad Agha assassinated. The Shu'aybs lost their local importance thereafter, and Mansur reestablished the Sayfas in their Akkar stronghold. After the demise of the Shu'aybs and Mansur's subsequent elimination of other local rivals he became the preeminent strongman of the Tripoli region; the Sayfas, with whom he continued to be allied, became his fiscal subordinates and there were no reported conflicts between Mansur and Yusuf before 1579. By then, Mansur had become the most powerful chieftain in Syria, acquiring the tax farms of the neighboring sanjaks of Homs and Hama and the port town of Beirut. Governorship of Tripoli First term Tripoli Citadel The Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government in Constantinople) designated the Tripoli Sanjak as its own eyalet in 1579, likely to check Mansur's growing power and to strengthen Ottoman authority over Mount Lebanon and its environs in general; Duwayhi holds the Porte was responding to complaints about Mansur's killing of local rivals, which Abu-Husayn determines was used by the Ottomans as a pretext to keep a closer watch on Mansur because of his stockpiling of firearms acquired from the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571 and suspected ties through his Maronite advisers with Catholic European powers increasingly active in the eastern Mediterranean. Yusuf was promoted to the rank of pasha and appointed the new eyalet's first beylerbey. The subsequent loss of tax farms in Tripoli Eyalet, such as the predominantly Maronite area of Bsharri, and the appointment of Yusuf, weakened the Assafs. According to Abu-Husayn, Yusuf was selected after \\"careful deliberation\\" by the Ottomans. On the one hand, the Porte determined Yusuf was well-positioned to efficiently manage the eyalet by dint of his long career in the Tripoli area, his ties to the local chiefs and his understanding of local politics. On the other hand, he would be easier to control because he lacked the tribal and peasant power bases of the Assafs and Ma'ns; further, Yusuf's headquarters in Hisn Akkar was more accessible and thus easier to reduce than the headquarters of other local chiefs nestled deep in the Lebanon range. By appointing Yusuf to a rank and position above that of the Assafs, his hitherto superiors, the Porte also aimed to undermine their alliance. The Sayfas' position was significantly strengthened with Mansur's death in 1580. In 1585 an Ottoman expedition was launched against the local chieftains in Syria, including Yusuf. While the expedition's commander Ibrahim Pasha attacked the Druze chiefs in the Chouf, a veteran commander, Ja'far Pasha al-Tuwashi, raided Hisn Akkar, an event which only Duwayhi mentions. During or shortly after the expedition, Yusuf was dismissed and replaced by Ja'far Pasha; Yusuf may have resisted his dismissal and Ja'far Pasha's raid against Hisn Akkar may have been the commander's response to his resistance. Following the government raids, most of the chiefs taken captive by the Ottomans were released to their home bases, including Mansur's son and successor Muhammad. The prominence of the Assafs was reconstituted by Muhammad, who became Yusuf's principal local rival. Muhammad had persuaded the Porte of his loyalty and was given the territory of Tripoli Eyalet, except for Tripoli city, as iltizam shortly after his release in 1585, once again placing Yusuf and his kinsmen in Akkar as fiscal subordinates of the Assafs; the Sayfas maintained their iltizam in Akkar, but were responsible to Muhammad, through whom they forwarded revenues to the Porte. Second term Yusuf and Muhammad likely waged a struggle for political dominance of the Tripoli region afterward. By 1590 Yusuf had been reinstated as beylerbey in place of Ja'far Pasha, though he may have been reappointed before 1590. In that year he was ordered by the Porte to arrest the advisers of the Assafs from the Maronite Hubaysh family, the brothers Abu Sa'd Mansur and Muhanna, and to deal with certain tax and administrative matters. Yusuf's attempts to arrest the Hubaysh brothers likely instigated conflict between him and Muhammad. Duwayhi held that Yusuf owed Muhammad tax arrears, while Ottoman records indicate that Muhammad had owed taxes to the Porte, which ordered the beylerbey of Damascus to collect them with Yusuf's assistance shortly before Muhammad's death in 1590 or 1591. Muhammad had set out from Ghazir against Yusuf but was assassinated en route at Musayliha on Yusuf's orders. His death without progeny marked the end of Assaf power. Muhammad's tax liability was transferred to Yusuf, who was ordered to appropriate all of Muhammad's money, real property and stockpiled goods. Yusuf subsequently confiscated Muhammad's iltizam in Tripoli Eyalet. He took possession of Assaf properties in Beirut, Ghazir and Antelias, either forcibly or by purchasing them from Muhammad's widow. The imperial order further called for Yusuf to imprison Muhammad's kethuda (chief aide) Ghumayda, investigate his books and confiscate his wealth. Although the Porte's order called for Yusuf to transfer all confiscated Assaf assets and moneys to the Ottoman state, he did not comply and kept the possessions for himself. In the same year, he carried out the 1590 imperial order to arrest and execute the Hubaysh brothers. In 1592/93 Husayn ibn Janbulad, the Kurdish chieftain of Kilis and career Ottoman official, was appointed beylerbey of Tripoli, an act which, for unclear reasons, was opposed by Ghumayda, who had since been released and given charge of an iltizam in Tripoli Eyalet. When Ghumayda set out for Constantinople to protest Husayn's appointment, he was killed en route. The Porte, suspecting Husayn's involvement in the killing, canceled his appointment to Tripoli before he could assume the office. The episode may have caused tensions between the Sayfa and Janbulad clans. Yusuf remained in office through 1592, when the Porte issued an order to him regarding the shipment of olive oil- based soap from Tripoli, an important soap production center in the 16th‚Äì17th centuries, to Constantinople. The Porte also sent notices to the beylerbey of Damascus that year raising concerns about Yusuf's employment of imperial Janissaries stationed in Damascus. =Early conflict with Fakhr al-Din II= A sketch of Fakhr al-Din II, who became Yusuf's most prominent local adversary from 1598 until Yusuf's death in 1625 In 1593 Yusuf married Muhammad's widow and took control of the Keserwan and Beirut iltizam. His new wife was escorted to Tripoli by his Shia Muslim allies, the Hamade clan. Yusuf's takeover of Beirut and Keserwan, both of which were part of Damascus Eyalet, gained him the ire of the Damascus provincial government. His increasing proximity to Ma'nid domains in the southern Lebanon range provoked Fakhr al-Din II, the sanjak-bey of Sidon-Beirut Sanjak from 1592 and the son and successor of Qurqumaz ibn Yunis, who had died in the 1585 expedition. In 1598 the Damascus beylerbey Seyyed Mehmed Pasha ordered Fakhr al-Din and Musa al-Harfush of Baalbek to force Yusuf out of the Keserwan and Beirut. Fakhr al-Din and Musa engaged Yusuf's forces in a battle near the Dog River in the Keserwan, slaying his brother or nephew Ali Sayfa, and conquering Beirut and Keserwan. Fakhr al- Din held the two territories for one year, before agreeing to withdraw his forces and return both territories to Yusuf after reaching unspecified accommodations with him. The battle at the Dog River inaugurated a rivalry between Yusuf and Fakhr al-Din which lasted for the remainder of Yusuf's life. The rivalry became a conspicuous aspect of the local culture, as exemplified in a verse from the wine ode of a contemporary poet addressed to his companion: > Let us not speak of Ibn Sayfa and Ibn Ma'n > enemies seek one another out > What have we to do with wars? > ‚Äî Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Akrami al-Salihi of Damascus (d. 1637). Yusuf engaged the Hamades in 1600 to assault and drive out the muqaddams (local chieftains) of the village of Jaj in the Byblos subdistrict in retaliation for their alleged support for Fakhr al-Din. Yusuf furthered his ties with the Damascene Janissaries, allying with one of their two main leaders, Kurd Hamza. In 1601 Yusuf sent 1,000 soldiers to back the Damascene Janissaries when they were blocked from entering Aleppo by an imperial guard. Kurd Hamza repaid Yusuf the following year by participating in his fifty-day siege of Musa in Baalbek. After they captured its citadel, they pillaged several villages in its countryside, including Hadath. In that village, Yusuf executed several captive partisans of Musa because of their alleged culpability in the slaying of Ali Sayfa at the Dog River. =Conflict with Ali Janbulad= In 1606 Ali ibn Ahmed ibn Janbulad, a nephew of Husayn ibn Janbulad, launched a revolt from Aleppo. Although Ali remained ostensibly loyal to Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I, he engaged in secretive talks with the Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand I, to establish an independent realm over Syria; the Tuscans had also been negotiating a secretive alliance with Fakhr al-Din from 1603. Yusuf, fearing the ambitions of the Janbulads and seeking to curry favor with the Porte, requested and obtained from the imperial government military aid and the rank of serdar (commander-in-chief) of the Ottoman forces throughout Syria in late 1606. At the time the bulk of imperial forces were engaged in the war with Austria, compelling the sultan to grant Yusuf's request. Yusuf stood gain considerable clout by neutralizing the Janbulads' ambitions without obliging the Porte's direct intervention. Ali viewed Yusuf as an obstacle to his territorial ambitions in Syria and resolved to kill or capture him. Yusuf's forces, consisting of the imperial and provincial troops of Damascus, Tripoli and Hama, were routed by Ali in a relatively quick battle near Hama on 24 July. Yusuf fled to Tripoli and most of his allies defected to Ali. Fakhr al-Din, despite Ottoman orders to join Yusuf, joined Ali after Hama. Ali and Fakhr al-Din advanced through the Beqaa Valley, while a division of Ali's forces led by his cousin Darwish ibn Habib attacked Tripoli. Yusuf fled the city for Cyprus, leaving command of Tripoli's citadel to his mamluk (slave soldier) Yusuf. Darwish's troops plundered Tripoli's countryside and captured the city after a short battle, taking the treasure stored in the citadel. Fakhr al-Din likely retook the Keserwan from Yusuf about the same time. From Cyprus Yusuf went to Haifa, a port village controlled by the sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad Turabay. After securing an escort of Damascene Janissaries, he proceeded to Damascus. Ali and Fakhr al-Din proceeded through Wadi al-Taym, bringing them closer to the city. Yusuf mobilized his Damascene troops, including the Janissaries, which were swelled by soldiers from Jerusalem, Nablus, Gaza, Lajjun, and Ajlun, all sanjaks of Damascus located in Palestine and Transjordan. A dissident Janissary faction led by Kiwan ibn Abdullah secretly collaborated with Fakhr al-Din. Ali and Fakhr al-Din moved their forces to the suburbs of Damascus where Yusuf's troops, led by his nephew Muhammad, were defeated in a battle on 30 September or mid-October. head of the Ottoman armies in Syria, made an unsuccessful last stand against the rebel Ali Janbulad at Krak des Chevaliers in 1606. Despite frequent dismissals from Tripoli and territorial losses to his adversaries, Yusuf consistently held onto the fortress. Shortly after he died, his sons surrendered it to Fakhr al-Din Part of the Damascene troops retreated into the city, rejecting Ali's demand to surrender Yusuf. The suburbs were then sacked for three days and Yusuf was besieged. He attempted to escape, but the officials of Damascus, alarmed at the potential economic fallout of the city's impending sack, forced him to pay 100,000 gold piasters as compensation before allowing his departure. According to al-Burini, Yusuf did not lead his troops during the Damascus engagements and \\"remained in hiding among the womenfolk\\" until he could be \\"smuggled out of the city by night\\" under the escort of a Damascene guard. Ali condemned the city's leaders upon hearing of Yusuf's flight, claiming had they \\"wanted peace and safety they should not have allowed him [Yusuf] to leave, knowing that I only came ... to seek him, because he had bought [a] war against me from the Porte for 50,000 dinars\\". Ali lifted the siege after being bribed by the Damascenes with Yusuf's forfeited money plus an additional 25,000 piasters. Yusuf escaped to the Krak des Chevaliers, a fortress in the Homs Gap governed by his uncle Mahmud Sayfa. Ali pursued Yusuf and demanded that he make peace sealed by a marriage alliance between their families. They reached an arrangement whereby Yusuf, Fakhr al-Din and Ali wielded practical control over Syria with Ali at their head. Abu-Husayn notes the agreement left Yusuf \\"in the awkward position where he became subservient to the rebel Ali Janbulad, while trying at the same time to remain loyal to the Porte.\\" Ali's revolt was suppressed in 1607‚Äì1608 by Grand Vizier Kuyucu Murad Pasha after imperial troops were released from the Austrian front following the Peace of Zsitvatorok. Tensions with the government out of office =Consolidation of local alliances and dismissal= By the 1600s Yusuf \\"had become almost completely Syrianized\\", in the words of Abu-Husayn, by becoming enmeshed in the power structure of Syria's chieftains instead of solely dependent on the Porte, except that he continued to lack his own significant, local power base. His closest local ally was the Kurdish Sunni emir Musa of Ras Nhash. Yusuf's closest Bedouin allies were the Al Musa of the Akkar plain. Among the Druze chieftains of the southern Lebanon, Yusuf was allied with the rivals of Fakhr al-Din, namely Shaykh Muzaffar al-Andari of Ain Dara in the Jurd subdistrict southeast of Beirut, Emir Muhammad Ibn Jamal al-Din of Choueifat in the Gharb subdistrict south of Beirut and the Sawwaf muqaddams of Shbaniyya in the Matn subdistrict east of Beirut. He also split Harfush ranks by allying with one of the family's chiefs, Shalhub. By Yusuf had been dismissed by Kuyucu Murad Pasha and replaced by an official from Constantinople, Husayn Pasha al-Jalali. His dismissal may have been intended to check his burgeoning local power or was engineered by Fakhr al-Din, who maintained close ties with the grand vizier dating to the 1590s. To prevent Yusuf from hindering his replacement's attempts to collect taxes in the eyalet, the grand vizier in 1610 instructed the beylerbeys of Damascus and Aleppo and Fakhr al-Din, who was still sanjak- bey of Sidon-Beirut and Safad, to assist al-Jalali in the event. Around that time a kapicibasi (head doorkeeper) sent by the beylerbey of Damascus Ahmad Pasha al-Hafiz to collect a debt from Yusuf was taken captive and executed by Yusuf along with his two attendants. The Porte afterward sent an order to al- Jalali to arrest and punish the killers without naming Yusuf explicitly. With frayed relations between him and the government, Yusuf sought improved ties with Fakhr al-Din, sending reinforcements to aid the latter's son Ali during a battle with the Damascene Janissaries in the Hauran in 1613. Later that year an expedition by al-Hafiz compelled Fakhr al-Din's flight to Tuscany. Yusuf used the opportunity to reclaim the Porte's favor, sending a force under his son Husayn and nephew Ahmad Sayfa to fight alongside al-Hafiz. The Sayfa force intercepted Ma'nid reinforcements from their Deir al-Qamar headquarters sent to relieve the Ma'n-held Beaufort Castle on the Litani River. The Sayfas played the key role in the siege fighting at Beaufort. Husayn began to burn Deir al-Qamar, but was stopped by an official order after the Ma'ns submitted to al-Hafiz. During the expedition, al-Hafiz rewarded the Sayfas by restoring to them Beirut and Keserwan. By early 1614, Husayn was made a pasha and appointed beylerbey of Tripoli, though Yusuf unofficially exercised power. The Sidon-Beirut and Safad sanjaks became an eyalet in 1614 and its beylerbey Bustanci Hasan Pasha demanded and received from the Sayfas the tax farm of Beirut; they refused to hand over Keserwan and repulsed an attempt by Bustanci Hasan to seize it. By 1615, Sidon Eyalet was dissolved and they retook Beirut once more. =Ouster from Tripoli= The Sayfas' ascendancy ended in 1616 as a result of imperial and provincial reshuffles; The Sayfas lost a friendly grand vizier in Nasuh Pasha, al-Hafiz was replaced in Damascus by Cherkes Muhammad Pasha who transferred Beirut and Keserwan to the Ma'ns, Husayn was replaced by al-Jalali and sent to the Safavid front, and Yusuf's enemy Yunus al-Harfush was appointed sanjak-bey of Homs and attacked Yusuf's allies Shalhub and the Al Musa. Yusuf resisted the transfer of Keserwan and Beirut to the Ma'ns, who subsequently defeated the Sayfas and their Druze allies in four engagements in the southern Lebanon in August. Yusuf's son Hasan, on his way back to Akkar after retreating from Keserwan was captured by al-Jalali's troops and released after a large bribe by Yusuf. The following year, Husayn was arrested and executed in Aleppo on his way back from the Safavid front, despite Yusuf's attempted bribery of the Porte. As his position with the government deteriorated, Yusuf's nephews, the sons of Ali Sayfa, Muhammad and Sulayman, defected from him. The former had been made sanjak-bey of Jableh in Tripoli Eyalet in late 1615, while the latter proclaimed his alliance with the Ma'ns from his fortress of Tula in Jubbat Bsharri after Husayn's execution. Yusuf stamped out Sulayman's rebellion shortly afterward. Fakhr al-Din returned to Mount Lebanon in December 1617 and took advantage of Yusuf's weakened position. In 1618/19 Umar Pasha Kittanji was appointed beylerbey of Tripoli, though his practical authority was confined to the city of Tripoli, the countryside being controlled by Yusuf, who refused to forward tax revenues to the new governor. Fakhr al-Din, who offered to help Umar Kittanji assert control over the eyalet, marched against Hisn Akkar, which Yusuf abandoned on 3 February 1619. Fakhr al-Din plundered the fortress and a caravan of provisions bound for Yusuf, who had set up base in Krak des Chevaliers with his Druze allies. Yusuf's young grandson Muhammad ibn Husayn was captured and held hostage by a Ma'nid force, while Fakhr al-Din proceeded to besiege Yusuf on 7 February. Muhammad and Sulayman Sayfa, meanwhile, restated their alliance with the Ma'ns and fortified themselves in Safita. At the same time Yunus al- Harfush captured the Sayfa-held subdistricts of Hermel and Qayraniya, both north of Baalbek. Third term As the siege against Yusuf progressed the Porte, possibly seeking to avoid a total victory by Fakhr al-Din, reinstated Yusuf as beylerbey of Tripoli. Fakhr al-Din and Umar Kittanji pressed their offensive, having the village of Akkar burnt down and recruiting Yusuf's men in the forts of Byblos and Smar Jbeil south of Tripoli. Afterward, the beylerbeys of Damascus and Aleppo moved their troops to Homs and Hama, respectively, to support Yusuf. With the leverage afforded by the government, Yusuf bargained with Fakhr al-Din and Umar Kittanji, who agreed to a bribe of 50,000 piasters each, with an equivalent sum to be paid later. They lifted the siege on 4 March and Yusuf assumed office in Tripoli shortly thereafter. Yusuf remained under financial strain due to debts owed to the Porte, the beylerbeys of Damascus and Aleppo, and Fakhr al-Din. The latter had taken over Byblos and Jubbat Bsharri during the Krak des Chevaliers siege and Yusuf, unable to pay his debt to Fakhr al-Din, agreed to sublease their iltizam to him for four years in compensation. In 1620 Yusuf attempted to regain the tax farms by offering Fakhr al-Din permanent peace terms, but his offer was rejected. Instead, Fakhr al-Din moved to bribe the Porte 100,000 piasters to have Yusuf replaced by al-Jalali, while Fakhr al-Din's kethuda Mustafa was appointed sanjak-bey of Jableh and Latakia. In response, Yusuf pledged 230,000 piasters to the Porte, resulting in the cancellation of the appointments to al-Jalali and Mustafa before either could assume office. Fakhr al-Din continued machinations against Yusuf, securing an alliance with the Damascus Janissary leaders Kurd Hamza and Kiwan, who pressured Yusuf's son Umar Pasha, the sanjak-bey of Homs, to execute his kethuda over a land dispute. When Yusuf attempted to subjugate his nephew Sulayman in Safita in June 1621, Fakhr al- Din allied with Sulayman and jointly took over the village of Akkar where the Sayfas' houses were again destroyed. In the following month, the Porte, unable to collect owed taxes from Yusuf, charged Fakhr al-Din with collecting the payment. The Ma'nid emir advanced against Yusuf's domains, capturing the fortress of al-Bahsas south of Tripoli before besieging its citadel. Under pressure, Yusuf, who fled to Jableh, agreed to surrender his properties in Beirut, Ghazir and Antelias to Fakhr al-Din personally, thereby definitively ending Sayfa claims to the Keserwan and Beirut. The siege was maintained until the tax arrears to the Porte were paid. Yusuf persuaded the Porte that Fakhr al-Din was using the tax issue to take over Tripoli Eyalet and promised to pay the arrears. Fakhr al-Din was consequently withdrawn from Tripoli on 2 October 1621, while Yusuf paid part of the arrears out of the silk revenues of the eyalet. Fourth term Yusuf was dismissed from Tripoli on October/November 1622 for failure to remit the balance of the eyalet's tax arrears. He refused to relinquish the post to his replacement, Umar Kittanji, prompting Fakhr al- Din to mobilize his men at Ghazir. Yusuf then fled to Akkar, but was abandoned by his son Beylik, who defected to Fakhr al-Din, his father-in-law. Umar Kittanji assumed office in January 1623, but was unable to extract the tax revenues of the province, which were held by Yusuf. Fakhr al-Din agreed to assist Umar Kittanji in return for the tax farms of Byblos, Jubbat Bsharri, Dinniya and Jabal Akkar. The Porte reinstated Yusuf as beylerbey later on 23 January, which Fakhr al-Din accepted, provided he retain the newly acquired tax farms of the eyalet. To meet his tax obligations to the Porte and avoid further dismissals from Tripoli, Yusuf advanced once more against Sulayman in Safita, but again called off the campaign after Fakhr al-Din mobilized his troops in Bsharri against him. Beylik, meanwhile, took control of Hisn Akkar and threw in his lot with Fakhr al-Din, who was assisted by Beylik and Sulayman during an expedition near Hama to assist the Bedouin emir of the Al Abu Risha, Mudlij ibn Zahir al-Hayari, against his cousin Husayn ibn Fayyad al-Hayari in November. In 1624 the two Sayfas were joined in their alliance with Fakhr al-Din by Yusuf's son Umar Pasha of Homs. By then, Yusuf's allies Shalhub and Muzaffar al-Andari had also defected to Fakhr al-Din. In the spring the Porte dismissed Yusuf as beylerbey, but he refused to turn over the city to his replacement Umar Kittanji, who alternaively docked his ship in the port of Batroun, which was controlled by the Ma'ns, in April. From Tripoli Yusuf negotiated with the Porte to reinstate him on the one hand, and with Fakhr al-Din, whose assistance was requested by Umar Kittanji, to stall the Druze emir from military action. By August he had secured his reinstatement and bribed Fakhr al-Din to hold off an assault. His authority was effectively restricted to the city of Tripoli, the Krak des Chevaliers, the Jabala Sanjak governed by his son Qasim, and the Koura subdistrict held by the Kurdish emirs of Ras Nhash; the rest of the eyalet, namely the subdistricts of Jubbat Bsharri, Batroun, Byblos, Dinniyeh and Akkar and the sanjaks of Safita and Homs, were in the hands of Fakhr al-Din or his Sayfa allies. Death and legacy Yusuf died on 14 or 15 Sha'ban 1034 AH/21 or 22 July 1625. Naima noted that Yusuf had lived for considerably longer than a century. The Aleppine historian Abu al-Wafa al-Urdi (d. 1660), remarked that a Sufi religious leader considered Yusuf to be among four men of whom \\"time had become weary\\". In the words of Abu-Husayn, Yusuf's \\"arrival as a levend in Syria had started the history of the Sayfa family there ... his death, for all practical purposes, brought this history to an end\\". Residual influence and demise of the Sayfas The divisions within the Sayfa household deepened with Yusuf's death. Three of his surviving sons, Qasim, Mahmud and Beylik divided his domains with Qasim given control of Tripoli city. His rule was not recognized by the Porte, which appointed Mustafa Pasha ibn Iskandar beylerbey in late 1625. The new governor allied with Fakhr al-Din, appointed Sulayman to Hisn Akkar, and moved against Yusuf's sons. Qasim fled to the Margat fortress in Jabala Sanjak, and Beylik and Mahmud fled to the Krak des Chevaliers. Fakhr al-Din turned against Sulayman, attacking Safita and forcing him to seek protection with Mudlij al-Hayari in the Abu Risha stronghold of Salamiyah. The Bedouin emir executed Sulayman in late 1625 or early 1626 on the Porte's orders for alleged collaboration with the Safavids. Around that time Yusuf's sons surrendered Margat and the Krak des Chevaliers to Fakhr al-Din, who interceded on their behalf with Mustafa Pasha. Two more beylerbeys were successively appointed to Tripoli, Umar Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha, before Fakhr al-Din was given the post in 1627, which he held until his imprisonment by the Porte in 1633. Afterward, Qasim was made a pasha and appointed beylerbey in 1634. Upon being ordered to the Safavid front later that year he pretended insanity and was replaced by his nephew Ali Sayfa, the son of Yusuf's daughter. Yusuf's son Assaf, whose mother, Malak Sama bint Abdullah, was a concubine, drove Ali out of Tripoli after two months in office. Ali then allied with Ali Alam al-Din, the Ottoman-appointed successor of Fakhr al-Din over the Druze iltizam of southern Mount Lebanon, and with his support defeated Assaf and retook control of Tripoli, as well as Batroun and Byblos, in late 1635. In 1636 Ali was replaced as beylerbey by Mustafa Pasha Nishanji, who appointed Ali over Byblos, Batroun and Dinniya. When Nishanji was sent to the Safavid front, he made Assaf his placeholder over the eyalet to Ali's chagrin. Strife ensued between the two Sayfa chiefs, which caused heavy casualties and financial strain among the eyalet's inhabitants, who were obligated to pay each chief the same taxes. After Ali was defeated near Arqa, the two Sayfas were reconciled though the mediation of the Abu Risha emir Tarbush. Before the end of the year, a new beylerbey was appointed to Tripoli, Barjal Ahmad, and not long after, in 1637, the reconciliation between Assaf and Ali unraveled for unclear reasons. Ali was backed by Barjal Ahmad and Alam al-Din, while Assaf was supported by Mulhim, Fakhr al-Din's nephew and successor over the Ma'ns, and the Abu Risha emir Assaf ibn Mudlij. The latter faction moved against Ali, chasing him into the Alawite Mountains. The Porte appointed Shahin Pasha to replace Barjal Ahmad with explicit orders to destroy the Sayfa family. He invited the Safya chiefs to meet in his camp in the Homs Gap where he trapped and executed Assaf, hanging his body at the Kras des Chevaliers, while Ali, suspicious of the summons, fled the eyalet. Shahin Pasha proceeded to exterminate any Sayfas in and around Tripoli and confiscated their properties. The only recorded survivors of the family were Ali, Assaf's mother Malak, and a certain Sulayman Sayfa whose relation to Yusuf was not clarified by the sources. Ali took refuge with Alam al-Din in the southern Lebanon, while Sulayman was reported in the Akkar subdistrict in 1640. That year, he fought a government force in the area then fled, with nothing else known about him. Malak retired to the Qaymariyya quarter of Damascus and was recorded living there later in the century by the historian Muhammad al-Muhibbi (d. 1699). According to Muhibbi, when asked about her family, she recited a verse lamenting their demise. With the elimination of the Sayfas, the family \\"appear[s] to have been completely forgotten\\" in the region, according to Abu-Husayn. Assessment The Soap Caravanserai (Khan al-Saboun) in Tripoli, which was originally built by Yusuf in the early 17th century as a barracks The sources present a mixed assessment of the rule of Yusuf and the Sayfa family in general. The Sunni Muslim Tripolitanian scholar Mustafa Jamal al-Din Ibn Karama offered the most positive view of Yusuf's rule, writing \\"In his eyalet, the ra'iyya (subjects) sleep in peace, and wake up happy because he is there\\". Ibn Karama, al-Burini, al-Muhibbi, al-Urdi, Najm al-Din Muhammad al-Ghazzi (d. 1651) and Ramadan al-Utayfi (d. 1684), all members of the urban Sunni Muslim scholarly establishment in Syria, indicate that Yusuf was known for his generosity and patronage of poets and Sufis. Examples include Yusuf's protection of the Sufi sheikh Ahmad al-Kawakibi of Aleppo who fled the persecution of Aleppo's beylerbey Husayn ibn Janbulad in the 1600s, his financial assistance to the impoverished Hanafi mufti and poet Ibrahim al-Batruni of Aleppo, and the generous treatment of al-Burini upon his visit to Tripoli and Akkar in 1599/1600. Remarking on the Sayfa family's generosity, al-Utayfi wrote \\"People, whether needy or not, called on them from various regions; it is said that they have revived the days of the Barmakids\\", who were known for their generosity. Salibi asserts Yusuf's spending and patronage partly caused his consistently poor financial state. Likewise, Abu- Husayn holds that Yusuf's generosity represented \\"a costly means to gain recognition\\" amid persistent financial difficulties, which frequently resulted in his dismissal from office or his loss of fiscal districts. The view of Yusuf by imperial Ottoman officialdom is reflected in Naima's assessment: > Yusuf Pasha was a devious old man with a white beard, a sunburnt complexion, > and a long face. He killed many men in Tripoli and threw them into a well, > so that nobody could say that the Pasha killed any one. He terrorized people > to that extent, and by so doing he managed to acquire large amounts of > money, burying many treasures in various ruins. In the assessment of Salibi, because the inhabitants of the Akkar, like the townspeople of Tripoli, were predominantly Sunni Muslims and were loyal, or at least not opposed in principle to the Ottoman state, which they considered the global bastion of Sunni Islam, Yusuf \\"stood to gain ... [the inhabitants'] support\\" by serving the Ottomans. Although the Sunni Muslim townspeople and peasants generally supported Yusuf, who maintained close relations with the Ottoman officials of Tripoli, his local manpower remained opportunistic and not loyal to him personally. Yusuf strove to gain the trust of the Maronites of Byblos, Batroun and Jubbat Bsharri, for whom the Ottomans were generally unpopular. To that end he fended off an attack against the Maronites of Jubbat Bsharri by Shia Muslim peasants from Baalbek in 1602. Duwayhi, who calls Yusuf \\"a great emir\\", noted the friendly ties between Yusuf and one of Duwayhi's predecessors, Patriarch Yusuf al-Ruzzi (1597‚Äì1608), for whom Yusuf frequently secured permits of safe conduct. Duwayhi also stated that under Yusuf, Maronites who had professed Islam to secure their personal interests reverted to publicly proclaiming their Christian faith. Nonetheless, Yusuf continued to be viewed as an agent of the state and its oppressive policies by the Maronite peasantry. His oversight of the Porte-ordered quartering of troops in 1607 led to the abandonment of four Maronite villages in Batroun, while his excessive taxation on fruit trees in 1621 led to the ruin of eight villages in Jubbat Bsharri and the flight of many Maronites to Damascus and Aleppo. The Maronites preferred the rule of Fakhr al-Din, a practically independent native who had considerable support from the Maronites' Catholic coreligionists in the Italian states. The English traveler George Sandys, who visited Syria in 1610, noted: \\"this Joseph [Yusuf Sayfa] [was] hated of his people for his excessive tyrannie.\\" Neither Yusuf nor the other Sayfas invested in or promoted the economic development of Tripoli and its eyalet. There are no indications in the sources that they took an interest in the city's soap industry, though a barracks built by Yusuf in Tripoli later became the city's Soap Caravanserai (Khan al-Saboun). Instead of fostering commerce in Tripoli's well-positioned port with its easy access to the major cities of the Syrian interior, Yusuf committed acts discouraging foreign trade. One of the acts recorded by the sources was his confiscation of the gold, goods and cloth of two Venetian ships docked in Tripoli's harbor in 1623. Yusuf concocted evidence that the ships' crews were Maltese pirates and consequently had all eighty crew members beheaded on the shore. The Venetian consul in Izmir went to Tripoli to investigate, but was threatened by Yusuf's secret messengers that he would execute all the European residents in Tripoli if the investigation continued. According to al-Khalidi, no foreign ships docked at Tripoli after the incident. The eyalet under the Sayfas' underwent a gradual economic decline. In contrast, under Fakhr al-Din the ports of Beirut, Sidon and Acre thrived while agriculture prospered in the Galilee and the southern Lebanon. Upon his appointment to Tripoli in 1627, Fakhr al-Din planted thousands of mulberry trees to stimulate the eyalet's silk production. In the words of Salibi, Yusuf was \\"a poor manager of affairs\\", and lacked the imagination and energy of Fakhr al-Din, to whom he was indebted.

The personal home of Bishop George Worthington of the Episcopal Church, the Worthington Mansion was a place of high social and religious importance during the pioneer era of Omaha history. During its history, the mansion also served as the second Presbyterian Hospital and as the White House Apartments.  Design  The location of the Worthington Mansion reflected his great wealth on arrival to Omaha. The banking family of brothers Herman and Augustus Kountze established an exclusive neighborhood for wealthy people on South 10th Street, due south of downtown Omaha, in the early 1880s. Herman Kountze's estate was called Forest Hill, and was renowned for one of the most commanding views of Omaha. Bishop Worthington had his mansion constructed adjacent to Brownell Hall, an Episcopalian girls boarding school, and its accompanying chapel, St. Matthias Episcopal Church. Gordon W. Lloyd, an English-trained architect who worked in Detroit, was the architect of the Worthington Mansion. Lloyd was noted as a designer of Episcopal churches and related buildings, and was from Worthington's former diocese in Michigan. Designed in the high Queen Anne style, the home has retained many of its original interior features. They include 26 rooms, a grand staircase, large parlor, separate devotional room, a large library and den, as well as many bedrooms. Originally, the arms of the local Episcopalian diocese were cut into the glass on the front doors, which also had the personal arms of Bishop Worthington on the inner doors of the vestibule.\\"A bachelor bishop,\\" Omaha World-Herald, August 28, 1885Mead & Hunt, Inc.

Soon after its construction, Bishop Worthington's sister and brother moved from Ohio and New York to join him living in his mansion. The three were all unmarried at first, with Bishop Worthington marrying later in life. Bishop Worthington is attributed with serving in Omaha until 1899;\\"History of the Diocese\\",] The Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska. however, an obituary in The New York Times states he left Nebraska in 1890. Worthington's mansion was quickly surrounded by other mansions, including the 1893 Drexel Mansion at 1244 South 10th; the 1894 Charles Kountze Mansion at 1234 South 10th; and the 1887 Peter Ihler Mansion at 1248 South 10th Street. During this early era the Worthington Hospital, named in honor of the Bishop, was built nearby at South 10th and Pierce Streets, too.  After Worthington  In the early 1900s, the Worthington Mansion became home to the Presbyterian Hospital. It was one of several mansions that were acquired by for the hospital. However, by the 1930s the hospital had moved out and the building became home to the Lutheran Home for the Aged.\\"Frederick Haas dies,\\" Omaha World-Herald March 20, 1937.

As a journalist and poet, she wrote works to promote equality of men and women and Dominican sovereignty, writing in opposition to the US occupation. As a feminist, she fought for the right to vote, the right of women to education, and employment protections for women and children. Early life Mercedes Laura Aguiar Mendoza was born on 16 February 1872 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Mar√≠a Antonia Mendoza and Eugenio Aguiar. She attended the school established by Salom√© Ure√±a, known as \\"Instituto de Se√±oritas\\" and which was the first higher education facility in the Dominican Republic. In 1887, Aguiar was in the first graduating class of the school along with Leonor M. Feltz, Altagracia Henr√≠quez Perdomo, Luisa Ozema Pellerano, Catalina Pou, and Ana Josefa Puello Career Upon completion of her studies, Aguiar began teaching at the Institute and remained there until 1893, when the school closed because of the illness of its founder. She then worked in the school founded by her classmate Luisa Ozema Pellerano and her sister Eva Mar√≠a and then served for 30 years in the Institute of Salom√© Ure√±a. When the United States invaded and occupied the Dominican Republic in 1916, Aguiar joined with a vocal group of women, to form the Sociedad Amantes de a Luz (Society of the Lovers of the Light of Day). She served as the group's secretary and they spoke out against the U.S. invading the country and violating its sovereignty. She served in the same capacity on the Junta Patri√≥tica de Damas (Board of Patriotic Ladies) These ladies were striving for the recognition of not only nationalist rights, but women's rights and worked on various causes, including establishment of maternity and children's hospitals, orphanages, and nurses' training facilities; free health care and medical services for the poor, health campaigns throughout the country to end endemic diseases, nutrition education, sanitary housing and playgrounds for working class neighborhoods and child care centers for working mothers; and educational improvements including school breakfasts and lunches, adequate uniforms, development of school libraries, and trade education. In 1942, she was appointed as the delegate for Santo Domingo to the First Congress of Dominican Women, which aimed at improving the educational opportunities of women to improve their socio-economic and political opportunities but also make them better helpmates for the men in their lives. Shortly after the conference, women won the right to vote that same year. In 1945, Aguiar was one of the special delegates appointed to counsel the Convention of the Dominican Party so that \\"The Reform of the Principles and Statutes\\" addressed the concerns of women. The women pushed for reforms for maternity laws to protect women workers. In addition to her teaching and activism, Aguiar was active as a writer, publishing many articles in such journals as La cr√≥nica, La Cuna de Am√©rica, El Eco de la Opini√≥n, Letras y Ciencias, List√≠n Diario, and La Revista Literaria. While most of her works have been lost, Adolfina Henr√≠quez de Smith collected a group of them and made a mimeographed binder of some of her most noted works, including the speech she made at the 1942 Women's Congress. In 1937, after fifty years of teaching, she was commemorated by the Ministry of Education and in 1944 granted the Gold Medal of Honor for Education by the government. Death and legacy Aguiar died of heart problems on 1 January 1958 in Santo Domingo. Posthumously, she was recognized for her contributions to the development of education in the Dominican Republic by a street and a school which bear her name.

Hybart (pronounced \\"Hibbert\\") is located at (31.826506, -87.382094). It is located at the intersection of Alabama State Route 41 and Monroe County Road 56, in the northwestern part of Monroe County, just a short distance from its border with Wilcox County, Alabama. Hybart is the host of a locally famous Alabama turkey hunting competition called the Butterball which has appeared in Mobile Bay Magazine. The area is also known for being a good hunting spot for whitetail deer, turkey, quail, dove, and duck. Hybart is on the northwestern edge of the Red Hills region of southwestern Alabama, a hilly, wooded, and still largely undeveloped part of the state, geologically distinct from the Gulf Coastal Plain to its south, and the Black Belt region to its north. Within the Red Hills region, the Forever Wild Land Trust of Alabama owns two large tracts of land a few miles to the southeast of Hybart. Recreational opportunities in these tracts include hunting, woods road hiking/exploration, wildflower viewing, photography, and bird and wildlife watching. The Red Hills tracts are open to visitors year-round. History A post office called Hybart was established on June 15, 1926; it would operate for nearly 50 years, until it was closed on May 21, 1976. James Willis Hybart, an early postmaster, gave the community his last name. Prior to being called Hybart, the community was called Vredenburgh Junction (established 1915-1916), as it was located at the intersection of the recently completed Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway and the previously existing short line Vredenburgh Saw Mill Company Railroad; the Vredenburgh Saw Mill Company Railroad had been completed a few years prior, and ran to the nearby sawmill community of Vredenburgh, Alabama, located about four miles east of Hybart. The Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway fell into receivership in 1917, but would continue to operate until it was acquired by the Muscle Shoals, Birmingham, and Pensacola Railway in 1922. In 1924 the Muscle Shoals, Birmingham, and Pensacola Railway would itself fall into receivership, and in the following year would be acquired by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (known as the \\"Frisco\\"), who would operate it until 1980, when Burlington Northern Railroad acquired Frisco. Frisco offered passenger service through Hybart on its \\"Pensacola Special\\", that ran from Pensacola, Florida, to Memphis Tennessee, via Amory, Mississippi; passenger service was eventually discontinued on February 1, 1955. The railway is currently owned by the Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway. Mr. Hybart had previously operated a store at the nearby community and steamboat stop of Bells Landing, Alabama (which no longer exists), located a few miles southwest of Hybart on a bluff on the east bank of the Alabama River. Local lore has it that sometime in the mid 1920s, Mr. Hybart, who also operated the only general store in Vredenburgh Junction, persuaded the local Frisco train agent to change the name to Hybart by offering the agent a free hat. Another local legend has it that the words \\"Vredenburgh Junction\\" would not fit on a standard postmark stamp and thus another name had to be chosen for the post office for this community. The first known map reference to \\"Hybart\\" is from the 1928 Post Route Map of Alabama. Passenger train at the Hybart depot of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway in 1954. The depot was torn down in the early 1970s.

The T1 tanker classification is still in use today. T1 tankers are about in length and are able to sustain a top speed of about . The hull designation AO is used by the US Navy to denote the ship is a T1 oil tanker and AOG that the T1 is a gasoline tanker. The small size allows the T1 to enter just about any sea port or to anchor around a small island, this was very useful during the Pacific War. The T1 tanker can carry about 48,000 to 280,000 bbls. Some T1 tankers were used to transport goods other than oil, a few were used for black oil-crude oil, diesel, chemicals and rarely bulk cargo like grain. T1 tankers are also called liquid cargo carriers. The T1 tanker has about a 6,000 to 35,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT) of cargo. The small size also gives the ships short turn around time for repair, cleaning, loading and unloading. A T1 tanker carrying dirty cargo, like crude oil needs a few weeks of labor to clean before carrying clean cargo. Most T1 ships during World War II were named after major oil fields.National Park Service, Scotts Bluff T1 tankers are operated by the US Navy, War Shipping Administration and United States Maritime Commission. Some T1s were loaned to England in the Lend-Lease program for World War II, after the war most were returned to the US. After World War II many of the T1 ships were sold to for civilian use. Each T1 had emergency life rafts on the boat deck. The ships had cargo booms and piping to load and unload fuel. During war time the T1 are armed for protection with deck guns. A typical ship may have one single 3\\"/50 dual purpose gun, two 40 mm guns and three single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. A T1 at war time normally had a crew of 38 and up to 130. If operating as a United States Merchant Marine ship, the crew would be a mix of civilian Merchant Marines and United States Navy Armed Guards to man the guns.NJ Scuba, Tankermarad.dot.gov, Coastal Tankersmarad.dot.gov, Coastal Tankermarad.dot.gov, Activation specifications for t1 -m-bt2 tankerAuke Visser's, T1 Tanker typesnavsource.org USS Klickitat (AOG-64)shipbuildinghistory.com, T-1 Tankers US classes *T1-M-A1 tanker: Called a small Coastal tanker, Includes the .

These membranes are involved in import of certain lipids from the ER to mitochondria and in regulation of calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function, autophagy and apoptosis. They also play a role in development of neurodegenerative diseases and glucose homeostasis. 300x300px Role  In mammalian cells, formation of these linkage sites are important for some cellular events including: Calcium homeostasis Mitochondria associated membranes are involved in the transport of calcium from the ER to mitochondria. This interaction is important for rapid uptake of calcium by mitochondria through Voltage dependent anion channels (VDACs), which are located at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). This transport is regulated with chaperones and regulatory proteins which control the formation of the ER‚Äìmitochondria junction. Transfer of calcium from ER to mitochondria depends on high concentration of calcium macrodomes in the intermembrane space, and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) accumulates of calcium into the mitochondrial matrix for electrochemical gradient.  Regulation of lipid metabolism Transport of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria from the ER for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine through the ER-mitochondria lipid which transform phosphatidic acid (PA) into phosphatidylserine (PS) by phosphatidylserine synthases 1 and 2 (PSS1, PSS2) in the ER and then transfers PS to mitochondria, where phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) transform into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PE which is synthesized at mitochondria goes back to ER where phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase 2 (PEMT2) synthesizes PC (phosphatidylcholine).  Regulation of autophagy and mitophagy  The formation of autophagosomes through the coordination of ATG (autophagy-related) proteins and the vesicular trafficking by MAM.  Regulation of the morphology: Dynamics and functions of mitochondria, and cell survival  contacts between mitochondria and ER in apoptosis300x300px These contact sites have been associated with the delicate balance between life and death of the cell. Isolation membranes are the initial step to form auto-phagosomes. These closed membranes are double membrane-bond, with lysosomes inside it. The main function of these membrane is degradation, as role in cellular homeostasis. However, the origin of them has remained unclear. Maybe it is the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria. But the ER- mitochondria contact site have markers, the auto-phagosome marker ATG14, and the auto-phagosome-formation marker ATG5, until the formation of auto-phagosome is complete. Whereas, the absent of ATG14 puncta, it is caused by the breakdown of the ER‚Äìmitochondria contact site The oxidative stress and the beginning of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occur together; the ER stress have a key sensor enriched at the mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). This key is PERK (RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase), PERK contributes to apoptosis twofold by sustaining the levels of pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). A tight ER‚Äìmitochondria contact site is integral to the mechanisms controlling cellular apoptosis and to inter-organelle Ca2 + signals. The mitochondria- associated ER membranes (MAMs), play role in cell death modulation. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), is a reason of the higher matrix Ca2 + levels, which is acts as a trigger for apoptosis. MOMP is the process before apoptosis, which is accompanied to permeability of the inner membrane of the mitochondria (IMM). Permeability transition pore (PTP) opening induces mitochondrial swelling and outer membrane of the mitochondria (OMM) rupture. Moreover, PTP opening induce releasing of caspase-activating factors and apoptosis. Caspase-activating factors induced by cytochrome C to bind to the IP3R, this will result in higher Ca2 + transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, amplifying the apoptotic signal.  Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD)  MAMS play an important role in Ca+2 Homeostasis, phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism. Research has associated the alteration of these functions of MAMs in Alzheimer's disease. Mitochindrial associated membranes associated with Alzheimer's disease have been reported to have an up- regulation of lipids synthesized in the MAMs juxtaposition and an up regulation of protein complexes present in the contact region between the ER and mitochondria. Research has suggested that the sites of MAM are the primary sites of activity for Œ≥-secretase activity and amyloid precursor protein (APP) localization along with the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) proteins. Œ≥-secretase functions in the cleavage of the beta- APP protein. Patients diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease have presented results that indicated the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide in the brain which in turn leads to the amyloid cascade suggestion. Also up increased connectivity between the ER and the mitochondria at MAM sites has been observed in human patients diagnosed with familial AD (FAD) by increase of the contact sites. These individuals showed mutations in the PS1, PS2 and APP proteins at the MAM sites. This increased connectivity also caused an abnormality in Ca+2 signaling between neurons. Also with regard to the role in MAMs in phospholipid metabolism, patients diagnosed with AD have been reported to show alterations in levels of Phosphatedylserine and phostphatedylethanolamine in the ER and mitochondria respectively, this leads to the intracellular tangles containing hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule‚Äêassociated protein tau within tissues. Parkinson's disease (PD) One of the causes of Parkinson's disease is mutations in genes encoding for different proteins that are localized at the MAM sites. Mutations in the genes that encode the proteins Parkin, PINK1, alpha-Synuclein (Œ±-Syn) or the protein deglycase DJ-1 have been linked to this disease through research. However, further research is still being considered in order to determine the direct correlations of these genes to Parkinson‚Äôs disease. In normal conditions, these genes are believed to be responsible for the cells ability to degrade mitochondria that has been rendered nonfunctional in a process known as mitophagy. However, mutations in the Parkin and pink1 genes have been associated with the cells becoming incapable of degrading faulty mitochondria. The proteins alpha-Synuclein (Œ±-Syn) and DJ-1 have been shown to promote MAM function interaction between the ER and the mitochondria. The wild-type gene that codes for Œ±-Syn promotes the physical junction between ER and mitochondria by binding to the lipid raft regions of the MAM. However, the mutant form of this gene has a low affinity to the lipid raft regions, thereby diminishing the contact between the ER and mitochondria and causing accumulation of Œ±-Syn in Lewy bodies which is a major characteristic of PD. Further research on PD association with alterations in MAM is still being developed.

In May 2017, Marcos graduated with honors from Cornell University, receiving a Bachelor's of Science degree in Neuroscience, and a minor in American Indian Studies. He is the first person from the Pascua Yaqui Reservation to graduate from an Ivy League University. While at Cornell Marcos spent time working as a researcher in the cognitive development laboratory of Dr. Gary Evans, and Dr. Alexander Ophir's Brain and Behavior laboratory. In addition to research at Cornell University, Marcos spent time as a researcher at the University of Arizona, where he worked in the neuro-pharmacology laboratory of Dr. Todd Vanderah, publishing a study on Neurokinin Receptor -1 (NK‚ÇÅR) antagonists and Substance-P (SP) implications in neurological addiction reward pathways. Marcos Moreno with fellow Udall Scholar Victor Lopez-Carmen Outside of work in research, Marcos has been involved with public health work with his tribe and abroad. In 2013, Marcos was a part of the St. John's University founding chapter of the Global Medical Brigades that began taking trips to west Africa to administer medical care to rural villages. In 2014 Marcos was a part of a public health project on the Pascua Yaqui Reservation aimed at assessing the Pascua Yaqui Tribe's health department, in addition to improving standards of care and standards of living on the tribe's reservation. In 2016, Marcos was awarded the Morris K. Udall Award that recognizes undergraduate scholars in the United States for their work in the fields of Environmental Activism, Public Policy, or Healthcare. In 2017 Marcos received the Henry Ricciuti Award recognizing his outstanding \\"distinction in research, excellence in leadership, and to exceptional community and public service\\". Also in 2017, Marcos received the Solomon Cook Award for Engaged Research and Scholarship, an honor awarded to one Cornell undergraduate per year. In the fall of 2016, the Cornell Daily Sun reported that Marcos was inducted as a member of the 125th tapping class of Quill and Dagger, one of the oldest secret societies in the Ivy League. With membership now being too difficult to conceal, the names of all newly tapped Quill and Dagger members are published in Cornell's newspaper, however there is still much speculation as to what the privileges and benefits of these 'secret' organizations actually entail, as much of their practices remain unknown.

The United Brothers was a fraternal organization similar to the Odd Fellows or the Masons. The group initially sought to help provide impoverished blacks with decent burials. During the American Civil War (1861-1865) the group expanded its mission to caring for the sick. In 1868, they received a charter and organized a state grand lodge.Wright, George C.

Out of sight: The rise of African American popular music, 1889-1895. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2002. Legacy of Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies Taylor's Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies has been widely studied. In 1928, Newman Ivey White argued that the book was problematic because it did not distinguish black plantation hymns and white revival hymns. Later, George Pullen Jackson, who was an advocate of a later discredited theory that Negro spirituals have white origins, criticized the book for a lack of musicality in 1943, but used some of the scores from Taylor's collection as evidence for his theory. In 1979, Irene V. Jackson attempted to restore the significance of the collection in the eyes of historians with her work, and in 1988 Robin Hough added to collection, \\"is as interesting for its political and religious agenda as it is for its musical content.\\" The collection was widely influential at the time; noted revivalists Sol Tibbs and Fanny Tibbs sang from the collection and in 1901, Sol Tibbs republished a versions of Mama, Mama Make Cinda 'Haive Herself', which he took from the book.

M. Stirling and James Doohan and published by Baen Books. It consists of The Rising (published in 1996), The Privateer (1999) and The Independent Command (2000). Plot summary The Rising The Rising begins in media res during a conflict between two groups, the Commonwealth and an extremist religious group the Mission Of Life Lived In Ecclesia (commonly referred to as \\"Mollies\\") and the Mollies' allies, an alien species known as the Fibians. The basis of the conflict is that the Mollies settled an otherwise worthless sector of the galaxy, later discovered to naturally have extremely rich sources of easily obtainable antihydrogen, an energy particle that is required for the high-technology space travel and civilization, and difficult to manufacture artificially. Commander Peter Raeder, formerly a pilot, has been assigned as chief engineer on the new fast carrier ship CSF Invincible, a smaller carrier type the Commonwealth hopes to use to preserve their dwindling stockpile of antihydrogen for as long as possible. Shortly after launch, Raeder becomes aware that there is a Mollie sleeper agent aboard performing acts of sabotage to prevent the success of the fast carrier design. After several missions and assorted acts of sabotage, Raeder successfully IDs the sleeper and manages to prevent the final sabotage, which would have destroyed the entire ship. A sub-plot involving piloting of a Speed, the in-universe space superiority fighter, is that a pilot requires two flesh-and-blood hands to properly interface with the fighter for battle (Raeder had lost a hand prior to the events of The Rising, and though outfitted with a high-tech prosthetic otherwise indistinguishable from a real hand, cannot make the link, the prosthetic's sensory devices being unable to match the delicacy and precision required for interface). Toward the end of the book, Raeder's engineering staff successfully create an interface device that will work even for Raeder, on the basis that injuries such as Raeder's are becoming more common in the conflict, and losing an experienced pilot for such an injury drastically reduces the Commonwealth's pilot pool. The Privateer Fresh from the events of The Rising, Commander Peter Raeder is called to a board of inquiry for certain questionable actions during the first missions of the Invincible. When the board seems to be about to send Raeder to a desk job on Earth, a special ops Marine group catches Raeder's interest. In exchange for running a high-risk, high-reward undercover assignment, the Marine general will make sure that Raeder regains his position on the Invincible. With little other choice if he wishes to remain in space service, Raeder agrees. Going undercover with other Commonwealth military personnel as a pirate group, Raeder's assignment is to uncover an antihydrogen smuggling ring and gather vital intelligence on the Mollies and their Fibian allies. After successfully completing the assignment, Raeder is reassigned to the Invincible, though he will have to wait with the rest of the crew as during his assignment the fast carrier was heavily damaged and will require extensive repairs. The Independent Command In the final novel of the series, the crew of the Invincible find themselves in a distant, as yet unexplored by humans, section of the galaxy. There, they find the origin of the Fibian allies who have aided the Mollies so well in their war with the Commonwealth. While they work to unravel the mystery of the Fibians, the Commonwealth is near to running out of antihydrogen completely. The protagonists make a crucial discovery - the Fibians are not single united entity, but are subdivided along a sort of grouping by color, and only one color of which has actually allied itself with the Mollies. The other colors are ready be conclude an alliance with the Commonwealth. Having successfully gained this alliance, the Invincible returns to human space just as an otherwise final battle has been fought. The Mollie fleet is completely demolished, but their Fibian allies, despite taking losses of their own, still has roughly a three- to-one advantage over the Commonwealth. However, with the majority of the Fibian groups allying themselves with the Commonwealth, the Mollies' Fibian allies are quickly overwhelmed and the Commonwealth emerges victorious.

The fan film caught the attention of BuzzFeed, Entertainment Weekly, Time, Elite Daily, Business Insider, The Huffington Post, IGN, Seventeen, Moviepilot, MTV, BBC America, PopSugar, The Independent, and The Mary Sue. Plot Severus Snape is enjoying a drink in a bar when a stranger, whose face is covered, joins him. Asking Snape about himself, Snape tells him a story. Some time before, the Marauders ‚Äì James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew ‚Äì were in the same bar celebrating their graduation from Hogwarts. Upon seeing Snape, James challenges him to a duel. Before they all disapparate elsewhere, Lily Evans sees them. They appear on a forest, and James and Snape start dueling. However, Snape eventually becomes victorious, so Remus, Sirius, and Peter join the fight, and they all produce the Fiendfyre spell, creating a big, four headed fire monster, with each head being their animal form. Snape disapparates to elsewhere in the forest, and Remus, Sirius and James do too, while Peter joins them on foot. Using Legilimency, Snape predicts their next attack. However, the Marauders attack him at the same time, eventually having him cornered. Snape, remembering their bullying throughout the years, and Lily, rebounds the spells, applies the Cruciatus Curse to Sirius, and Sectumsempra to Remus. Before cursing Peter, he transforms into a rat and escapes. Snape approaches James and attempts to kill him, but Lily apparates before him, demanding an explanation. Snape apologizes for calling her a mudblood (seen in a flashback in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix). Lily tells Snape that she will forgive him if he changes and stops being with dark wizards, such as Bellatrix Lestrange. Lily disapparates with James, Remus, and Sirius. Returning to the first scene at the bar, the stranger tells Snape that he knows how it feels to be subjugated and feared for one's talents. He then asks Snape to join his ranks. Snape demands to know who the stranger is.

In 1024, during the reign of Caliph al-Zahir, Rifq led policing expeditions in the Egyptian countryside, earning him a reputation of loyalty. In 1049, he was appointed governor of Damascus in place of Nasir al-Dawla al-Hamdani, and headed a 30,000-strong expedition to assert Fatimid control over Aleppo, then held by the Mirdasid emir Thimal ibn Salih. His army consisted of Berbers, Turks, black Africans and, after it entered Syria, local Bedouin tribes. These diverse and often antagonistic factions quarreled frequently, weakening Rifq's army. After initial clashes with Thimal's troops outside Aleppo, many Bedouin defected and Rifq's officers ultimately deserted him for refusing their counsel. Rifq was captured, received a head injury and died in Mirdasid custody. Life Service with the Fatimids Abu'l-Fadl RifqAyalon 1999, p. 292. was aged around 80 when he died, according to historian Suhayl Zakkar, implying that he was born circa 970.Zakkar 1971, p. 143. Information about Rifq largely derives from the contemporary Egyptian historian al-Musabbihi,Lev 2001, p. 8. but also from other sources, including Ibn al-Muqaffa and Ibn Muyassar.Lev 2001, p. 9. According to historian Thierry Bianquis, Rifq \\"had his hour of glory in the reign of [Caliph] al-Zahir in 1024\\".Bianquis 1989, p. 559. He acquired a reputation as a loyal officer and commanded policing expeditions in the Egyptian countryside, including the Nile Delta.Bianquis 1989, p. 394. He was relieved of command from operations in the Delta as a result of a dispute between him and Mi'dad, another black eunuch and qa'id (general) of the Fatimid royal regiment. During the early part of Caliph al-Mustansir's reign, Rifq managed the royal palace and supervised the Turkish regiment of the army. According to an anecdote cited by al-Musabbihi, Rifq was once consulted by an Egyptian Christian man whose Muslim convert son was arrested by the authorities for adorning Christian symbols, an apparent act of apostasy. Rifq advised the man, with whom he had business dealings, to have his son feign insanity to avoid being convicted as an apostate, a capital offense in Fatimid Egypt. Expedition to Syria In 1049, al-Mustansir appointed Rifq the commander of an expedition to subdue Aleppo, which was held by the Mirdasid emir Thimal ibn Salih. The latter discontinued payment of the annual tribute to the caliph, prompting al-Mustansir to dispatch Nasir al-Dawla al-Hamdani to assert Fatimid authority.Zakkar 1971, p. 141. However, Nasir al-Dawla's army was decimated by the flooding of the Quwayq River, forcing him to retreat to Damascus in October 1048.Zakkar 1971, pp. 141‚Äì142. Al-Mustansir replaced Nasir with Rifq as governor of Damascus and also appointed him governor of Aleppo, should he succeed in subduing that district. Furthermore, the caliph made all the local Fatimid governors in Syria subordinate to him. Rifq was endowed amƒ´r al-umarƒÅ æ (commander of commanders), along with the additional titles of al- muzaffar (\\"the victorious\\"), fakhr al-mulk (\\"glory of the realm\\"), and  øumdat al-dawla wa- øimƒÅduhƒÅ (\\"mainstay and pillar of the dynasty\\"). Before he departed, he was bade farewell by the caliph at the outskirts of Cairo. The army he headed consisted of 30,000 troops, according to Ibn Muyassar, and was composed of Berbers, Turks and Black Africans; these regiments were not only diverse, but often antagonistic as they competed for influence within the Fatimid military and court. Rifq halted his army at al-Ramla in Palestine after meeting with a Byzantine envoy with a message from Emperor Constantine IX advising al-Mustansir to reconcile with Thimal; if the Fatimids continued their expedition, the emperor promised to give his backing to Thimal, who was a formal vassal of Byzantium.Zakkar 1971, p. 144. Rifq sent the Byzantine envoy to Cairo and waited for further instructions. Al-Mustansir's vizier, Abu'l-Barakat al-Jarjara'i, delayed the return of the envoy and ordered Rifq to hasten the conquest of Aleppo, intending it to be a crafty response to Emperor Constantine's appeal and warning.Zakkar 1971, pp. 144‚Äì145. Before he could depart from al-Ramla, Rifq's army became bogged down in raids by the Banu Tayy, a large Bedouin tribe from the area, which seized part of Rifq's equipment and supplies.Zakkar 1971, p. 145. Instead of attacking the Tayy, Rifq found himself obliged to pay and recruit them as mercenaries. As he continued toward Damascus, he was forced to make similar arrangements with the Banu Kalb and Banu Fazara tribes. The incorporation of Bedouin mercenaries exacerbated the factional tensions within his army, leading to quarrels and infighting between the various regiments, some of whom launched looting raids in the Damascene countryside. The Fatimid army eventually came together and moved north, capturing Hims then Hama; in both cities, quarreling between the factions took place and Rifq was forced to recruit more local forces. On 24 August 1049, he reached the suburbs of Aleppo \\"in very bad shape\\", according to Zakkar. Thimal had long prepared the city's defenses and his forces consisted of his Banu Kilab tribesmen and the city's inhabitants. He was also sent funds from Constantine and had the backing of Antioch-based Byzantine troops on standby. Death in Aleppo On 26 August, Rifq's forces clashed with the Mirdasid forces, during which a regiment of Kalbi mercenaries defected to Thimal.Zakkar 1971, p. 146. Rifq's officers advised him to withdraw his forces southward to recuperate and punish the chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, who were blamed for the army's poor performance. When Rifq refused these suggestions, the officers advised he appeal for peace with Thimal and issue a diploma in the caliph's name designating Thimal the governorship of Aleppo. Rifq again refused, prompting many of his officers to desert him and withdraw southward. The senior defections, coupled with Rifq's relocation of the army's treasures and provisions to Maarrat Misrin, was taken as a signal by the remainder of the army to desert. Meanwhile, the remaining Bedouin mercenaries began looting the countryside and Rifq was unable to impose order. The following morning, Rifq and a handful of his soldiers, were captured by Thimal's Bedouin horsemen and taken to Aleppo. At some point, Rifq was wounded in the head, causing him to be in a daze before dying on 30 August. In Zakkar's assessment, \\"There is no doubt that al-Munstansir built great hopes on the success of this army ... Rifq, who was appointed to lead the expedition, was incompetent ... and, as it proved, lacked military knowledge.\\"Zakkar 1971, pp. 143‚Äì144.

They strive to create economic development through environmental and resource protection. The ideas of a circular economy were officially adopted by China in 2002, when the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China legislated it as a national endeavour, though various sustainability initiatives were implemented in the previous decades starting in 1973. China adopted the circular economy due to the environmental damage and resource depletion that was occurring from going through its industrialization process. China is currently a world leader in the production of resources, where it produces 46% of the worlds aluminum, 50% of steel and 60% of cement, while it has consumed more raw materials than all the countries a part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) combined. In 2014, China created 3.2 billion tonnes of industrial solid waste, where 2 billion tonnes were recovered using recycling, incineration, reusing and composting. By 2025, China is anticipated to produce up to one quarter of the worlds municipal solid waste. China is constantly introducing new legislation to improve the effectiveness of their circular economy and sustainability initiatives. Every five years the Chinese Government introduces a new five-year plan, with different sustainability goals and economic growth targets the country would like to achieve. China is currently on its 13th Five-Year Plan, which was legislated on March 15, 2016. Other legislation that have been implemented in the last decade, which have been important in the development of China's circular economy are The Law for the Promotion of the Circular Economy, Circular Economy Development Strategies and Action Plan, and the 12th Five-Year plan. China is also active in developing policy aimed at establishing more sustainability practices and economic growth in future decades, with targets for the year 2020 and beyond. Circular economies can be implemented on a corporate (micro), inter-firm (meso) and societal level (macro). Corporate level implementation refers to initiatives related to the Eco-design of manufacturing plants, such as cleaner production and Environmental Management Systems (EMS) that are meant to reduce the production of harmful by-products. Inter-firm initiatives at the meso level are the implementation of Eco-industrial parks (EIPs), where industrial plants are constructed in close proximity and capitalize on the trading of industrial by-products, ultimately reducing waste. Societal level initiatives refers to the development of Eco-cities and Eco-provinces, which aims to address the social concerns with both production and consumption of products that pollute. China has various means of measuring the performance of their circular economy initiatives in regional and industrial park areas, being material flow analysis (MFA), life cycle analysis (LCA), CO2 emissions and economic returns. These performance indicators are helpful in measuring the effectiveness of the governments initiatives, though they are not the most efficient. The idea of introducing an emergy indicator system has been debated, where it is capable of measuring the performance of resource generation and product dimensions, using accounting indices and ratios.  Background  Circular economies are based on the 3R principle, being reduce, re-use, recycle. Reduce refers to a method of improving efficiency, where the input of resources are reduced and output levels are increased. Re-use is the implementation of integrated systems that uses recycled material in the input stage of the manufacturing process, where there is a less reliance on raw materials. The recycling principle revolves around implementing strategies that transform collected waste and normal output into a resource that can be used. The major economic reformation that occurred in China during the late 1970s caused the economy to experience rapid economic growth, increased international trade and large flows of foreign direct investment due to the attractive business environment of China‚Äôs new economy. The accelerated industrialization process of China's economy directly contributed to negative impacts on the environment, where there was a significant worsening of pollution, waste generation and resource depletion. China produces 46% of the worlds aluminum, 60% of cement and 50% of steel, while consuming more raw materials than all 35 OECD countries combined. China uses 2.5 kilograms of raw material to produce $1 GDP, while OECD countries only require 0.54 kilograms. The surge in output of heavy industries coupled with resource inefficiency, as well as levels of consumption comparable to the Western world, has influenced China into adopting a circular economy to ensure sustainable growth. Since China is experiencing their industrialization process later than many other countries they have benefited from the latecomer effect, where they have learned from the success and failures of other nations when creating policy of their own. China has primarily learned from the circular economy strategies of Germany and Japan, where they have shaped many of China's policies revolving around the three R's of re-use, reduce, recycle. Japan's Basic Law for Establishing Promoting the Creation of a Recycling-Oriented Society and Germany's Closed Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act has been the greatest influence on China's circular economy strategies. Japan has been successful influencing whole industries into adopting sustainability strategies, where they view recycling measures as a competitive advantage rather than a liability. China has learned from this by making EIP's and industry-wide recycling initiatives as core functions of their circular economy. Germany has been effective in promoting sustainable material management through better product design and interdependence between industrial projects, where China has advanced these techniques in their own sustainability endeavours. There has also been a rise in university collaboration between Chinese and German institutions over the years, which has allowed for more research and development of better strategies that China can implement.  Legislation   Previous  Sustainable economics started to surface in China around 1973, when the first ever National Environmental Protection Conference was held to discuss new environmental policies and guidelines. The following year Chinese State Council created The Leading Group of Environmental Protection, who's task was to formulate effective policies based on previous discussions at the National Environmental Protection Conference. In 1979, the most comprehensive environmental protection law adopted by China was enacted called the Environmental Protection Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, where basic policies were introduced to address conflicts between industrial growth and environmental sustainability. Some of the new policies introduced were aimed at controlling the growth of large urban zones and distribution of manufacturing plants in rural areas, through designing and expanding small cities. Other environmental policies enacted in the law targeted the reduction of pollution, through taxing incentives for pollution control and fines for violations. The Chinese government started taking environmental protection more seriously in 1983 after the second National Environmental Protection Conference, where it made environmental protection a core national policy. In the subsequent decades to follow numerous policies were implemented from the conferences until 2002, when the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China designed a sustainable development plan that aimed to quadruple GDP, increase social equality, recover and protect environmental integrity. This new sustainable development plan was enshrined in legislation and was then known as the start of a circular economy.  Current  = The Law for the Promotion of the Circular Economy = The Law for the Promotion of the Circular Economy was passed on August 29, 2008 during the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, where it was then implemented into practice on January 1, 2009. The law was outlined as a key strategy in national economic and social development, while promoting resource utilization efficiency, natural environment protection and sustainable development. The law contends that circular economies strategies will be implemented only if it is viable in technology, practical in economy, suitable in saving resources and protecting the environment. The State Council is responsible for the administration of promoting the circular economy, where they must organize, coordinate and regulate national circular economy strategies. Under the law any new industrial policies created by the Government must meet the criteria for promoting a circular economy. Industries must implement management systems that reduce resource usage and waste generation, while improving resource recovery and recycling. Through the Law for the Promotion of the Circular Economy the Chinese Government encourages research, development, promotion and international cooperation of science relating to circular economies, as well as supporting the education, publicity and popularization of scientific knowledge. The aim is to give citizens a better sense of better resource saving and environmental protection practices. = The 12th Five-Year Plan = The 12th Five-Year Plan was implemented in 2011 to 2015, as a national development strategy plan, where it outlined the country's shift in policy toward the recycling of heavy industrial resources, instead of previous models that practiced resource efficiency. Some objectives of the plan were to increase the re-using of industrial waste to 72% by 2015, while raising resource output efficiency by 15%. The plan outlined a three level strategy, where 10 critical recycling initiatives for industrial waste and converting industrial parks were implemented, 100 pilot cities such as Guangzhou and Suzhou were decided to test the initiatives, and a 1000 more industrial parks were to be created. There was an investment of US $468 billion to achieve the goals presented in the plan, where it was also directed at internalizing sustainability goals within the institutions and promoting a new growth pattern based on renewable energy. The goal of the initiatives were to get 50% of national industrial parks and 30% of provincial ones to undergo a complete circular economy transition by 2015, where there will eventually be close to zero emission of pollutants and waste. = The Circular Economy Development Strategies Action Plan = The Circular Economy Development Strategies Action Plan was created on January 23, 2013, where it further embedded the idea of a circular economy into Chinese legislation. The plan outlined three levels of circular economies in China, being within a company, industrial park and city or region. The plan outlines various targets for 2015 and 2020, where they are meant to address both industrial and social sectors. The goals that were meant to be fulfilled by 2015 are having a widely used resource recycling technology that is advanced, re-using 72% of industrial solid waste, a modern system for recovering at least 70% of waste products, and improving the recovery of important resources. Other goals include raising energy productivity by 18.5%, increasing water productivity by 43%, aiding the recycling industry to reach US $276 billion of output, and re-using 70% of some minerals that are heavy pollutants. The goals for 2020 outlined in the plan include having an innovative industrial technological system that can efficiently re-use and recycle material, as well as the creation of a new industry related to the manufacturing of innovative technical equipment that promotes competitive advantages. The advanced industrial technological systems should be able to address the waste management concerns of rural and urban areas by 2020. = The 13th Five-Year Plan = The 13th Five-Year Plan was released on December 5, 2016, where it outlines growth plans for the 2016-2020 interim. The plan is based on three core ideas, being strengthening management solutions, improving the quality of the environment and accelerating the repair of environmental damage. The plan puts an emphasis on improving the quality of water resources, through unit based management, basin-wide initiatives to address water pollution, protection of water bodies with good quality, creating strategies to tackle ground water pollution, and improving water quality in both urban and rural areas. Water quality is expected to reach grade III or equivalent for 70% of the countries surface water by 2020, according to the plan. There is also a focus on soil pollution, where there is going to be more implementation of comprehensive monitoring. The goal is to be able to use 90% of polluted soil, which is an increase from 70.6% in 2015. A new environmental protection tax and compensation framework is outlined in the plan, where it is aimed at promoting the green bond market in the country. Other key goals of the 13th Five-Year Plan include promoting circular production to establish a circular economy at all levels in society, creating a circular development system with new resource strategies, reducing waste and consumption, increasing resource efficiency, and supporting green initiatives. The plan also expects resources productivity to increase by 15% from 2015 levels, while the utilization rate of solid waste should reach 73%. Over 75% of national industrial parks and more than 50 provincial industrial parks should be practicing complete circular strategies by 2020. The output value of the recycling industry is expected to reach US $450 billion.  Implementation   Micro  Micro level strategies refer to small scale corporate initiatives that aims to reduce pollution and promote circular usage of waste, through better environmental management systems, cleaner production, waste reduction and improved Eco-design of industrial plants. Many laws have been enacted to influence companies to engage in micro level initiatives, rather it be from fines for mismanaging waste or tax incentives for using green technology. Improving cleaner production has been the most prominent and successful micro level strategy China has experimented with. Cleaner production strategies include removing toxic by-products from the production process, reducing pollutants throughout the life cycle of a product and including sustainability concerns when designing or delivering finished products. Cleaner production initiatives have been implemented in 24 provinces covering various industrial sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, transportation, chemical, machine manufacturing and textiles. To promote cleaner production the Chinese government has constructed various institutions to support micro level initiatives, being four cleaner production centres in the industrial sector, eleven cleaner production centres at the local level and one national cleaner production centre. These centres have trained thousands of people, where it has provided over 550 training programs for teaching individuals about cleaner production.  Meso  Meso level strategies refers to inter-firm initiatives, mainly eco-industrial parks (EIP's), where industrial plants are constructed in close proximity and capitalize on the trading of industrial by-products, ultimately reducing waste. To encourage the development of EIP's the Chinese government has outlined various national guidelines, through the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA). The national guidelines emphasize the need for integrated management systems for water, material and energy at the industrial park level, as well as the creation and support of eco-industrial systems between companies. Industrial park managers can reach their desired goals of waste minimization with maximum resource efficiency, through reducing the amount of energy and pollution used in product delivery. This is achieved through effective green supply chain management and recycling or redesigning packaging material. Chinese industrial parks are very different than the ones in North America, as they serve two purposes, being supporting circular economies in residential and manufacturing areas. A typical EIP consists of a residential, manufacturing, scientific research and business area, where they all share the benefits of a circular economy, since they are connected with one another. Since the EIP's have various stakeholders dependent on each other planners have had to create plans that address both residential and manufacturing areas. Some of these guidelines include, community eco-education and establishing specific working groups to implement the plans, while supporting dialogue between stakeholders. Over 100 EIP's have been guided by established principles, while 16 of the EIP's have been chosen as national demonstrations by SEPA.  Macro  Macro level strategies refers to initiatives at the societal level that address both the concerns of production and consumption, through the development of eco-cities and eco-provinces. The goal of eco-cities and eco-provinces is to establish the whole region as a circular economy, where everything is powered by recycled renewable energy and produces close to zero carbon waste.Joss, S., & Molella, A. P. (2013). The eco-city as urban technology: Perspectives on Caofeidian international eco- city (China). Journal of Urban Technology, 20(1), 115-137. As of 2003 cities such as Shanghai, Yangzhou, Guiyang and Hangzhou have all cemented plans for establishing an eco-city. To address the concerns of production on a societal level regional eco-industrial networks are encouraged, where they optimize efficient material use. The proliferation of scavenger and decomposer companies as an eco-industrial network has been beneficial in macro level strategies, as they are able to profit from turning waste into reusable organic, plastic, metal and other materials. The Chinese government supports these types of companies through preferential industrial recruitment and financial policies, such as land subsidies and tax incentives. To address the role of consumption on a societal level, the government and individuals are held accountable. Consumers are guided away from wasteful consumption, while the government supports environmental protection in daily life. Residents have seen an increase in choices of organic food free of pesticides, while recycled products have been labelled green to encourage its use. The production of harmful products that pollute have slowly been phased out by the government, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from refrigerators.  Measurement Indicators  The main indicator system used to measure China's circular economy is an altered version of the European Union's (EU) material flow analysis (MFA). MFA is a quantitative method of measuring the flow of natural resources and material through various scales of economy, which can range from whole cities to single rivers. It consists of methodically organized indices, where it then uses mass balancing to analyze the relationships between human activities, material flows and environmental degradation. The MFA can be altered to examine anything from all the energy flowing through an economy to single chemical element, such as carbon. The indicator system is effective in identifying the inefficient use of energy, natural resources and materials, as well as how material flow shifts affect the countries economy and environment. The Chinese government has extensively studied the EU's and Japan‚Äôs models of material flow analysis, where they have adapted it to fit their needs using the input of various actors and government agencies. The Chinese indicator system is based on the 3R principle, where two separate indicator systems are used for meso and macro level measurement. The only difference between the two indicator systems is that macro level measurement takes into account recycling at the regional level. Both indicator systems categorize quantitative data in the same four categories, being resource output, resource consumption, integrated resource utilization and reduction in waste generation. Resource output is the measure of GDP produced from consumption of land, energy and water, where higher ratios indicate resource efficiency. Resource consumption refers to the measurement of resources consumed per unit GDP level, where lower ratios indicate that less resources were used by the economic system. The implications for this measurement is that it demonstrates that there are fewer impacts on the natural environment, while having high economic returns. Integrated resource utilization measures the rates of re-using industrial water and recycling industrial waste, where high ratios indicate efficient resource recycling and regeneration of those material back into the economy. Having a high ratio on the integrated resource utilization indicator demonstrates a reduction in the use of natural resources and waste being sent to landfill sites. The reduction in waste generation indicator measures the total amount of waste disposal and emission of pollutants, where lower ratios indicate that there are low levels of waste needed to be disposed and low levels of toxic emissions. China has also experimented with other measurement indicators, such as life cycle analysis (LCA), CO2 emissions and economic returns, though MFA continues to be the most widely used. There has been extensive research on a new measurement system called the emergy indicator, where it is thought to be more effective than the MFA.

The collection contains a group of stories taken from several other collections Blixen had been simultaneously working on for several years.  Background  Last Tales was written over a period of some years beginning in the 1930s. Simultaneously, Blixen was working on a novel, Albondocani, which would remain unpublished, and three other story collections Anecdotes of Destiny, New Gothic Tales and New Winter‚Äôs Tales. She moved between the various collections, never completing any of them in their entirety. In 1957, she took seven stories from Albondocani and combined them with two stories from New Gothic Tales and three stories from New Winter‚Äôs Tales for publication. As she was compiling the stories in 1953, Blixen originally planned for Anecdotes of Destiny to be a final part of the Last Tales collection, but as she neared publication, she decided to release Anecdotes as a separate volume, published the following year. The collection did not receive the acclaim her other works had generated and was not selected for the Book of the Month Club. Some reviewers noted individual tales as meritorious, such as \\"The Cardinal's First Tale\\", \\"Copenhagen Season\\", \\"A Country Tale\\", and \\"Echoes\\", but overall critical response was not overly enthusiastic. Time Magazine‚Ä≤s review described the collection as a group of Gothic fiction, which combined a mixture of grotesque and sublime themes in which the romantic plot is obscured by the supernatural and \\"tragically turns on the concept of honor\\".  Contents  Tales from Albondocani Though the Tales of Albondocani are linked by recurring characters and a unifying theme, they lack a central figure, which she had described but never developed. She had indicated that her intent was to create a cycle of over 100 tales, reminiscent of One Thousand and One Nights, each complete within itself but woven into the others. Only the seven stories included in Last Tales and \\"Second Meeting\\" (1961) were published. * \\"The Cardinal's First Tale\\": the story opens when Cardinal Salviati is asked, \\"Who are you?\\" and rather than answer the question, he tells a story of his parents. His mother, Benedetta, married his father, Prince Pompilio, a much older man, when she was fifteen. As she was expected to do, she produced an heir, but the child was sickly and blind in one eye. Advised to practice abstinence so that Benedetta can regain her health, the young mother discovered passion in reading and music. During a performance of Pietro Metastasio‚Ä≤s Achilles at Scyros, Benedetta has a spiritual insemination from the castrato Marelli. When she gets pregnant again, the couple have a dispute as to whether to name the baby Atanasio (meaning orthodoxy) or Dionysio (meaning ecstasy). Pompilio is in favor of order, but Benedetta prefers controlled chaos. She gives birth to twins, symbolically birthing one child by her husband and the other by her desire for Marelli. After the two children are baptized, their home is destroyed by fire and one of the infants dies in the blaze. No one is sure which twin survived, but his father treats him as the patriarch of the church, while his mother sees him as an artist. Salviati become both artist and church cardinal. The various themes of the story are art and order, purity and erotic awakening, harmony and dissonance, intimacy and distance, loss and gain, masculinity and femininity. The overriding theme is Blixen's idea of what telling a story is about, craft, rather than just narrative. * \\"The Cloak\\" * \\"Night walk\\". The story takes place in Italy and focuses on an insomniac who is given the advice that by walking the streets at night, he will be able to sleep. The instructions indicate that he should begin in wide streets and traverse ever narrower paths until he comes to an end. At the terminus, he finds he is at his own home. * \\"Of Hidden Thoughts and of Heaven\\" * \\"Tales of Two Old Gentlemen\\" * \\"The Cardinal's Third Tale\\". The tale concerns Lady Flora Gordon, an aristocratic Scottish giantess, who loathes her size and body and shuns physical contact. While visiting Rome, she contracts syphilis when she kisses the foot of a statue of St. Peter. The disease removed her sense of purity and led her to make connections with other people. * \\"The Blank Page\\". Related by an elderly storyteller, the tale is a return to the theme of story telling as an art. It focuses on an exhibit in the gallery of a Portuguese convent, made of framed sheets. The bed linens are matrimonial sheets and most have bloodstains from the wedding night. In the center, hangs one pure, unstained sheet. The symbolism of the sheets is that they represent life stories told. New Gothic Tales * \\"The Caryatids: an Unfinished Tale\\" * \\"Echoes\\": this short story focuses on Pellegrina, a former opera star, who wants to train a young peasant boy to follow in her footsteps. To teach him courage, she pricked his fingers with a needle, wiping the drops of blood on a handkerchief. When she pressed the cloth to her lips, the student denounced her as a vampire. New Winter's Tales * \\"A Country Tale\\": a companion piece to an earlier work, \\"Sorrow-Acre\\" and deals with themes of tragedy and loss. * \\"Copenhagen Season\\" * \\"Converse at Night in Copenhagen\\"  References  Sources   External links * 1957 short story collections Works by Karen Blixen ","title":"Last Tales"},{"id":"52833057","text":"Besiana Kadare (born 1973) is an Albanian diplomat, the daughter of writers Helena Kadare and Ismail Kadare. She serves as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Permanent Representative of Albania to the United Nations, a Vice President of the United Nations General Assembly for its 75th session, and Albania's Ambassador to Cuba.

Kadare holds a master‚Äôs degree in modern and comparative literature, and a specialized high studies diploma in modern specialized literature from the Sorbonne Paris-IV University in Paris, France.New Permanent Representative of Albania Presents Credentials United Nations, press release of June 30, 2016. Career Early years Kadare served as First Secretary at Albania‚Äôs Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York from 2002-05. She returned to Albania in 2005 to work with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In 2008, Kadare served in Albania‚Äôs Embassy in France. Between 2011 and 2016, Kadare served as Albania‚Äôs Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris.  Permanent Representative of Albania to the United Nations Kadare presented her credentials to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on June 30, 2016, and since then has been the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Permanent Representative of Albania to the United Nations in New York. She was appointed to serve concurrently as Albania's Ambassador to Cuba. In October 2017, at a UN Security Council meeting, Kadare said that the meaningful inclusion of women in conflict prevention and peace processes remained negligible, with women being sidelined during peace negotiations even when they were present, as it was always men who led and decided when and how to make peace. She urged that Member States increase their commitment to fully integrate women in their peace and security agenda. In 2018 Muslim-majority Albania co-hosted an event at the United Nations with Catholic-majority Italy and Jewish-majority Israel celebrating the translation of the Talmud into Italian for the first time. Ambassador Kadare opined: ‚ÄúProjects like the Babylonian Talmud Translation open a new lane in intercultural and interfaith dialogue, bringing hope and understanding among people, the right tools to counter prejudice, stereotypical thinking and discrimination. By doing so, we think that we strengthen our social traditions, peace, stability ‚Äî and we also counter violent extremist tendencies.‚Äù In January 2019 Kadare on behalf of Albania co- hosted together with the World Jewish Congress and the United Nations Department of Global Communications an event on the theme ‚ÄúA story of humanity: the rescue of Jews in Albania‚Äù. She delivered remarks at the United Nations at a briefing entitled ‚ÄúHolocaust Remembrance: Demand and Defend your Human Rights‚Äù, marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day and reflecting on the genocide of six million European Jews during World War Two, and the little-known record of Albanians during the Holocaust in Albania, which took in thousands of Jews who would otherwise have ended up in the Nazi death camps. Kadare in December 2019 called the decision to award Austrian writer Peter Handke, widely regarded as a denier of genocide, the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature ‚Äúshameful,‚Äù saying it should forever haunt the Nobel Foundation.Alice Elizabeth Taylor (December 10, 2019). \\"Widespread Outrage among Albanians as Genocide Denier Peter Handke Wins Nobel Prize in Literature,\\" Exit News. =Vice President of the United Nations General Assembly= In June 2020 Kadare was voted a Vice President of the United Nations General Assembly for its 75th session.Shkruar nga Anabel (1 July 2020). \\"Ismail Kadare's daughter is appointed vice president of the UN General Assembly,\\" Anabel Magazine.E.
