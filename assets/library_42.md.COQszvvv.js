Extent The microcontinent Avalonia broke off Gondwana in the Late Neoproterozoic together with a series of terranes that either formed its eastern coast or a separate block called Ganderia in front of it, if so separated from the Avalon Zone by the several hundred metres-wide Dover Fault. These terranes include the Early Palaeozoic siliciclastic rocks of the Gander Zone, the eastern passive margin of the Iapetus Ocean, now found in Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and New England, but they also include the contemporaneous or slightly older rocks of the Bras d'Or terrane in Cape Breton Island, the 550 Ma Upsalquitch gabbro, the Brookville and New River terranes in New Brunswick, and the Seven Hundred Acre Island in Maine. The Gander Zone also extends to the British Isles: Southeast Ireland, Anglesey, Isle of Man, and the Lake District. The western margin of Ganderia is the Red Indian Line of the Iapetus Suture. Tectonic history The basement beneath Ganderia is unexposed, but the rock of the Green Head Group in southern New Brunswick, the oldest known, contains the Precambrian stromatolite Archaeozoon acadiense, and the Seven Hundred Acre Island Formation in coastal Maine has been dated to c. 670‚Äì1230 Ma, similar in age to that of the Amazonian Craton. Between 640 and 455 Ma intermittent arc magmatism were separated by soft collisional events, first in the Late Ediacaran and Early Cambrian while Ganderia was part of Gondwana, and then in the Ordovician when Ganderia was an isolated microcontinent. The first early phase of arc magmatism occurred 625‚Äì605 Ma in the Brookville and New River terranes, but also in Anglesey. The next phase of arc magmatism accompanied by metamorphism occurred at the end of the Precambrian in Newfoundland, New Brunswick and on Cape Breton Island. Ganderia probably separated from Gondwana near the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary when subduction ceased and a arc-back- arc system developed along a clastic passive margin. The separation of Ganderia opened the northern Rheic Ocean. Ganderia and Carolinia were probably connected during the Late Ediacaran and, if so, were collectively separated from Avalonia during the Early Palaeozoic. When Ganderia was finally accreted to Laurentia during the Late Ordovician and Silurian large scale magmatism accompanied its subduction. Its accretion to Laurentia during the Late Ordovician closed large parts of the Iapetus Ocean and the accretion of its trailing edge resulted in the Salinic orogeny (the closure of the Tetagouche‚ÄìExploits back-arc basin). Avalonia was subsequently subducted beneath Ganderia during the Silurian and Devonian.

Biography Frances Cushman was born on May 9, 1852, in the historical town of New Lisbon, Ohio, where her maternal great-grandfather, a Revolutionary soldier, and her grandfather, who fought in the War of 1812, settled in 1803. There her father, Dr. Sylvanus D. Cushman (1819-1908), a noted inventor, married Elmira Shawke (1822-1877). Frances Cushman was also married in New Lisbon. Dr. Sylvanus Cushman was a descendant of Thomas Cushman and Mary Allerton, a daughter of Isaac Allerton. The charter made between King James, represented by the Right Hon. Edmond Lord Sheffield, and Robert Cushman and Edward Winslow for themselves and their associates, gave Puritans a right to use certain lands. The first sermon ever preached on New England ground was by Robert Cushman, December 12, 1621, at \\"The Common House\\" of the colony on Leyden Street at Plymouth. There is a monument in the Plymouth Cemetery to his memory, and the copy of the sermon and the charter are justly prized by all Cushman descendants. Wines resided in Detroit, Chicago and Cleveland before moving to St. Louis in 1896. It was then she took up the real estate business. Having been an invalid for a number of years, she was advised to interest herself in open-air work, and be relieved of the care of a home, especially as she had no children. She went to Fredericks to place her house on sale and he found from her conversation that she understood many things about houses in the way of conveniences, decorations, etc., and proposed that she took up work of that nature. She did so and restored to health, had an object in life outside of the ordinary duties of \\"nursing furniture,\\" etc., and kept herself interested in things worth while, as well as the satisfaction of being able to guide young people and often older ones in doing what was best for themselves and their families. Frances Cushman- Wines Frances Cushman-Wines was in the real estate business, the only woman who was a member of the St. Louis Real Estate Exchange. Beginning in the office of A. H. Fredericks, she gained in the year she remained with him much practical information and a good training for a successful business career. For the next ten years she was connected with the firm of A. A. Fischer Real Estate Company. Fischer was a builder, and constructed his own houses. He sold, while Wines was associated with him, one thousand homes, and she stated that in all the contracts made not one out of that number was foreclosed by a mortgage. The houses were represented as they really were ‚Äî the best for the money. She used her good judgment in many ways and principally in never trying to make a sale to parties beyond what she knew they could afford to buy. Her special work was decorating homes. When possible buyers for a new house were found she visited their old homes, got their ideas as to furnishings, etc., and then tried to match the decorations in the house which she wished to sell them both to their taste and means, and in this way rarely ever failed to make a sale. She assisted in designing and decorating homes in Portland, Westmoreland and Parkview Places, as well as other desirable residence portions of St. Louis. While with Fischer, Wines acted as his sole agent. She later conducted a general real estate business of her own, being located in the office with A. H. Fredericks. She built for herself a small home, at 6179 Westminster Place, St. Louis, which she considered a model in every way. She had no family except her husband, Abner Gore Wines (1850‚Äì1916), who was with the American Type Foundry Company. One son, Earl C. Wines (1882-1883), died an infant. Outside of her regular work she had one other interest, collecting rare stones. In her traveling she kept an eye open for gems out of the usual, and consequently possessed many beautiful specimens, in cut, size, history, beauty and value. She had a very good idea of color values, and even in her gowns the gems were matched or harmonize. She died on August 26, 1928, and is buried at Lisbon Cemetery, Lisbon.

It was released for Early Access on August 28, 2015, through Steam. and the full game was released through Steam on May 19, 2016. It was released for PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 on November 15, 2016, and in Australia and Europe, three days later.

The player travels through the Jurassic oceans encountering many different prehistoric animals including Mosasaurs, Livyatans and Megalodons. Hi-tech probes, scanners and tracking systems are used to extract the data that is needed to combat the virus. It is also possible freeze time and scan creatures using echography and perform behaviour scans. After each mission all the data found is uploaded to the \\"DinoDex\\" which unlocks additional data and new creatures. In exploration mode, previous levels can be revisited to unlock additional scientific data and can uncover clues to aid in humanities survival. Development Time Machine VR was developed, over a period of 3 years, by the Canadian games company Minority Media Inc.

It was released for Windows on October 2, 2015 on Steam. The game uses claymation graphics to depict a surreal world.  Plot  The player character is Wayne, a humanoid being with yellow skin and crescent-shaped horns. Most of the game's NPCs speak using random text generation, in a manner described as a deliberately misleading red herring, albeit consistent with the setting, with the player's goals being represented through environmental design instead. The world and characters are alluded to be posthuman in nature and the goal of the game is to defeat the moon king Gibby.  Gameplay  Hylics plays like a traditional JRPG despite its surreal setting. Hit points are replaced with \\"flesh\\", while magic points are replaced with \\"will\\". Battles are shown from a first-person perspective, with the character's hands being shown performing attacks. Wayne loses all his flesh when defeated, but does not die, rather warping to an \\"afterlife\\" from which they can travel back to a previous area. Battle items are also unusual, such as being able to attack with a frozen burrito.  Development  The game was developed in RPG Maker and took a year to develop.  Reception  Emily Gera of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as \\"like a scene from Bosch by way of Videodrome\\". Chris Priestman of Kill Screen called the game's animation \\"wonderful\\" and stated that \\"to play a Mason Lindroth game is to delight in all that is possible within the material world and to learn how wonderful creation and destruction can be.\\" Jordan Devore of Destructoid said that Hylics was \\"the trippiest RPG I've ever seen\\".  Sequel  A sequel with higher resolution graphics was announced to be developed after the release of the first game. Hylics 2 was finally released on June 2020, featuring a quest to stop Gibby's minions from reconstituting their master.https://www.pcgamer.com/au/hylics-2-feels-like-a-long-lost-rpg- from-the-1970s/.

Because some scholars see the New Order Amish just as a subgroup of the Old Order Amish, the New Order Christian Fellowship is thus the most progressive affiliation among the Old Order Amish. In spirituality, they are close to Beachy Amish. Their use of horse and buggy transportation and their preservation of the German language distinguishes them from the Beachys, except for the Old Beachy Amish who have also retained the German language but drive cars.  History  In the late 1970s, there was a dispute among the New Order Amish if undesirable behavior should be treated by sanctions or by preaching. The context of this controversy was the fact that about half of the young people did not join the New Order Amish church. Therefore, some leaders had the impression that they had \\"gone too far\\" and that they had to \\"back up\\" a little, which was seen by the more liberal faction as a return to the \\"Old Order mentality\\". The more liberal faction, led by Aden Yoder, thus split from the New Order Amish in 1986 in Holmes County, Ohio, and formed the New Order Amish Fellowship.Charles Hurst and David L. McConnell: An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community, Baltimore 2010, pages 50-51.  Belief and practice  Like Old Order groups, New Order Amish Fellowship wear plain clothing, speak Pennsylvania German and use horse and buggy, but allow tractors for field work. They still speak Pennsylvania German, but there is a tendency to shift to the English language.Donald B. Kraybill: Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites, and Mennonites, Baltimore, 2010, page234. All New Order Amish districts still preserve the traditional Amish dress, although there is a trend towards slimmer brimmed hats and trimmed beards among the men. As for the women, they typically have brighter colors all around. The New Order Amish Fellowship allows electricity from the grid in the home and computers in shops but discourage television. New Order Amish may be more lenient in the practice of shunning, and may be more permissive of photography than lower-order groups.Amish Online Encyclopedia-\\"Differences Between New Order and Old Order Amish\\"  Population  In 2008 the New Order Fellowship had seven congregations in three states, Ohio, Maryland and Kentucky, with a total population of about 400.Donald B. Kraybill: Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites and Mennonites, Baltimore, 2010, page234. In 2001 they had four church districts in four settlements in three states, mostly in Ohio. The rate of young people who join the Amish, the so-called retention rate, among the New Order Amish Fellowship is the lowest of all Amish groups.

After showing considerable promise as a two-year-old, Short Story finished third in the 1000 Guineas in the following spring and then won the Epsom Oaks by four lengths. She never won again but was placed in the Nassau Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Park Hill Stakes. As a broodmare she produced one good racehorse, but otherwise made little impact as a dam of winners. Background Short Story was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire. She was sired by Buchan, who won the Eclipse Stakes, Champion Stakes and Doncaster Cup as well as finishing second in the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. As a breeding stallion he made his mark as a sire of fillies including Book Law and the dams of Airborne and Sun Castle. Her dam, Long Suit, finished third in the Oaks in 1921 and was a half sister to the influential broodmare Pinprick. Racing career=1925: two-year-old season= Short Story ran twice as a two-year-old in 1925, winning the British Dominion Plate over five furlongs at Sandown Park on her debut in July. On her only other start she finished second to Legionnaire in the Buckenham Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October. =1926: three-year- old season= On 30 April 1926 Short Story contested the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket and finished third of the twenty-nine runners behind Pillion and Trilogy, beaten one and a half lengths by the winner. The Sporting Life reported that she finished very strongly and looked capable of reversing the form over a longer distance. On 4 of June, Short Story, ridden by Bobby Jones, started the 5/1 favourite for the 148th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. She won the race by four lengths from Resplendent with two lengths back to Gay Bird in third place. In July Short Story finished third to Foliation and Part Worn in the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood. In the following month she contested the Yorkshire Oaks and ran second to Doushka. On her final appearance of the season she came home third behind Glasheen and Part Worn in the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Short Story a \\"poor\\" winner of the Oaks.

At this congress the socialist leaders rejected both cooperation and anarchism, both of which would allow the existing regime to continue, and adopted a program based on collectivism. The congress also adopted a motion that women should have equal rights to men, but several delegates felt that essentially woman's place was in the home. The congress has been called a triumph of Guesdism and the birthplace of French Marxist socialism, but both claims are open to question. The attendees soon split into rival groups with disparate beliefs. Location The Third Socialist Workers' Congress was held in Marseille on 20‚Äì31 October 1879. It was held in the Salle des Folies- Berg√®res. The Marseilles Congress followed the Congress of Lyon of 1878, and was the most important socialist congress in France before 1889 in terms of attendance, resolutions and its effect on the socialist party's constitution. The congress was followed by the 1880 Congress of Le Havre. Collectivism Jules Guesde could not attend in person, but his motion was adopted. Jules Guesde was a former anarchist who had converted to Marxism in 1876. Guesde was sick and bedridden in Paris at the time of the congress, but was represented by two jewelry workers, Jean Lombard of Marseille and Eug√®ne Fourni√®re of Paris. A motion composed by Guesde was moved by the delegates from Paris and carried by a large majority. It was: The congress adopted a Marxist program and supported collectivism by 73 votes to 27. The collectivists rejected efforts to found cooperatives as being petty bourgeois and covert capitalism. The delegates were also opposed to cooperation and to anarchism, both of which left the status quo undisturbed, and declared themselves in favor of political action. The congress has been described as a triumph of Guesdism, but in fact was a triumph of collectivism, which Guesde's opponents Paul Brousse and Beno√Æt Malon also supported. Foundation of the Socialist Party The suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871 was a severe blow to socialism in France, and for several years afterwards workers were reluctant to get involved in politics. At the congresses of Paris (1876), Lyon (1878) and Marseille (1879) only working men could speak and vote, and discussion of politics was banned. However Guesde wanted to organize a political party. He claimed that unlike conventional parties the new party would serve the interests of the workers rather than the ambitions of the party leaders. The congress decided that the proletariat should separate itself from all the bourgeois parties and form a new party. At first the party represented artisans such as hatters and shoemakers, but not weavers, miners or foundry workers. The new party had to compete for the attention of the workers with the Blanquists, the Anarchists, after 1881 with the Possiblists, and after 1890 with the Allemanists. Although the launch of the Parti Ouvrier (Party of Labour) by the 1879 congress has been treated by socialist and communist historians as the date when Marxist socialism was born in France, the new \\"party\\" was a loosely defined movement dominated by anti-political anarchists and anti-socialist radicals, with few members with recognizably Marxist views. It was only between the congress and the 1882 split that Guesde and Lafargue developed hardline Marxist positions. The party suffered from internal disagreements from the start. Anarchists such as Jean Grave disliked political involvement of any type, while Brousse was suspicious of Guesde's Marxist authoritarianism and thought the nationalization program would lead to a socialist dictatorship. Women's rights  Hubertine Auclerc attacking the fortress of Men's Rights, by Alfred Le Petit from Les Contemporains (1881) Some of the delegates defended the concept of the family wage, and argued against women's wage labour. One delegate said \\"woman's place is in the home, where so many daily concerns call her, and not in a factory or workshop ... The young girl should never learn any trade except those which, later, when she has become a wife and a mother, she can carry out in the home.\\" Isidore Finance, who represented the building painters of Paris, urged \\"tough-fisted and hardheaded workingmen ... to demand a wage that is not simply the equivalent to the product of their labours, but sufficient to keep women and the aged at home.\\" Hubertine Auclert made passionate pleas for women's rights, but argued that they needed economic independence due to their \\"natural\\" motherhood. Auclert was on a special committee to consider the equality of women, and was given an hour to speak to the congress on this subject. After her speech she was invited to head a committee to prepare a statement on women's rights. This statement, which said women should have the same social, legal, political and working rights as men was approved by the congress.

Background  In Yemen, separatists have been calling for the independence of South Yemen, which was until 1990 an independent state officially known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, with its state capital as Aden. After its incorporation into the Yemen Arab Republic, there were two major attempts to secede, the Yemeni Civil War of 1994 and the South Yemen insurgency (2009‚Äì2015). The Southern Transitional Council was created in May 2017. The governor of Aden Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, dismissed from his office on 27 April 2017 by Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, became its leader. The Southern National Assembly, made up of 303 members from every southern province, held its first parliamentary session in Aden on 26 December 2017. Amid tensions between the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council and the Saudi-backed Hadi government in Aden, the STC announced on 21 January 2018 that it would overthrow the Yemeni government within a week unless President Hadi sacked his entire cabinet, including Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr for corruption. The STC also declared a state of emergency until its demands were met. The government responded by banning protests in Aden, but the STC organised an anti-government rally for 28 January 2018.  Timeline = Outbreak of fighting = Gun battles erupted in Aden on 28 January 2018 when security forces loyal to the Hadi government attempted to prevent pro-STC demonstrators from entering the city. Districts reportedly affected by the fighting included Khormaksar, al-Mansoura, and Dar Sad, with protests taking place in al-Orouth square. Pro-STC forces were reported to have seized a number of government offices, including the Hadi government's headquarters. =28 January= The STC captured the government headquarters in Aden. The government also ordered its own troops to return to base, following fierce clashes across Aden. The fighting subsided by the evening after Prime Minister Daghr ordered a truce and instructed forces loyal to the government to return to barracks, witnesses said. In the night, the fighting continued. = 29 January = New fighting broke out after a brief ceasefire on the day before it collapsed. The STC sent reinforcements from Dhale and Shabwah provinces to Aden. Tank and heavy artillery battles were also fought that day, killing five STC fighters and four Yemeni government soldiers. The Presidential Forces led by Brigadier General Abdullah al-Subaihi began shelling Mount Hadid, which overlooks the 1st brigade for Security Belt Forces and is run by Major General Aidarus al-Zoubaidi. The two sides deployed tanks and began shelling one another in Khormaksar district, where snipers were on the roofs of buildings. The fighting moved into Crater district, and schools were closed for a second consecutive day. The STC would go on to proclaim victory on the 30 January. = 30 January = On the 30 January 2018, the STC claimed it had seized the entirety of Aden. The members of the Hadi-government present in Aden, including the Prime Minister, were surrounded in the Presidential Palace and \\"de facto under house arrest\\" but the STC did not enter the palace. Yemen's prime minister prepared to flee the country for Saudi Arabia after the STC seized the area around the presidential palace in the southern city of Aden in fierce battles overnight. The charity Save the Children suspended humanitarian work in the city due to the fighting. The STC seized the Dar Sad District, which was the last pro-Hadi stronghold, having captured the Crater and Tawahi districts earlier. Residents have said that the STC captured most of the city by day's end. = 31 January = On the 31 January, separatists took the office of the prime minister's secretary, but fighting no longer took place. The government and the STC exchanged prisoners after the fighting.

The unit of some 2,000 troops served alongside the American 9th Infantry Division from 1967‚Äì1968, when they were replaced by the Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division (\\"Black Panthers\\"). Organizationally, the unit consisted of a headquarters company with a communications platoon, an aviation platoon, an M113 armored personnel carrier platoon, a psychological operations platoon, a heavy weapons platoon with a machine gun section, and a four-tube 81mm mortar section; a service company consisting of a personnel and special services platoon and supply and transport, maintenance, and military police platoons; four rifle companies; a reinforced engineer combat company; a medical company: a cavalry reconnaissance troop of two reconnaissance platoons and an M113 platoon; and a six-tube 105mm howitzer battery. The deployment of the regiment to South Vietnam was divided into four phases. Acting as the regiment's quartering party, the engineer company left Bangkok by Royal Thai Navy Landing Ship, Tank (LST) on 11 July 1967 and arrived at Newport Army Terminal on 15 July. After unloading its equipment the company traveled by convoy to Bearcat Base, where it began work on the base camp. The advance party traveled by air to Bearcat on 20 August. The main body of the Regiment arrived during the period 19-23 September 1967. The last unit to arrive was the APC platoon, which had completed its training on 25 September and was airlifted to South Vietnam on 28 November. The area of operations assigned to the Thais was characterized by a low level of Viet Cong (VC) action because the land was used by the VC primarily as a source of food and clothing. Moving constantly and constructing new base camps, the VC had little time for offensive action. As a result, VC operations conducted in the Thai area were not as significant as elsewhere. Following a series of small unilateral and larger combined operations with Vietnamese units, the regiment launched Operation Narasuan in October 1967. In this, their first largescale separate operation, they assisted in the pacification of the Nh∆°n Tr·∫°ch District of Bien Hoa Province, killing 145 VC. The Thais built a hospital, constructed 48 kilometers of new roads, and treated nearly 49,000 civilian patients through their medical units. On 25 June at 07:55 two UH-1 Iroquois collided west of Bearcat Base killing 12 U.S. Army personnel, 16 Thai soldiers and one ARVN soldier.

The algorithm is based on a generalization of the Birthday problem which finds colliding hash values. It has severe time-space trade-offs but concedes vulnerability to unforeseen parallel optimizations. It was designed such that parallel implementations are bottle-necked by memory bandwidth in an attempt to worsen the cost-performance trade-offs of designing custom ASIC implementations. ASIC resistance in Equihash is based on the assumption that commercially-sold hardware already has quite high memory bandwidth, so improvements made by custom hardware may not be worth the development cost. General Equihash was proposed by Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich as part of the University of Luxembourg research group CryptoLUX. It was introduced at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego. Notable blockchain-based projects such as ZCash, Aion, Hush, and Pirate Chain have integrated Equihash for reasons such as security, privacy, and ASIC miner resistance. The manufacturer Bitmain has succeeded in optimizing the processing of Zcash's Equihash-200,9 with an ASIC.  Specification  Equihash has three parameters ‚Äì n, k, and d ‚Äì which determine the algorithm's time and memory requirements. The time complexity is proportional to 2^{\\\\frac{n}{k+1}+d}while the memory complexity is proportional to 2^{k+\\\\frac{n}{k+1}}. The algorithm is often implemented with d = 0 (using an alternative method of controlling the effective difficulty). The problem in Equihash is to find distinct, n-bit values i_1, i_2, ..., i_{2^k} to satisfy H(i_1) \\\\oplus H(i_2) \\\\, \\\\oplus \\\\, ... \\\\, \\\\oplus \\\\, H(i_{2^k}) = 0 such that H(i_1 \\\\parallel i_2 \\\\parallel \\\\, ... \\\\, \\\\parallel i_{2^k} ) has d leading zeros, where H is a chosen hash function. In addition there are \\"algorithm binding conditions\\" which are intended to reduce the risk of other algorithms developed to solve the underlying birthday problem being applicable. A memory- less verification requires 2^khashes and XORs.  Memory-hardness and time- space tradeoffs  It is proposed that the puzzle in Equihash be solved by a variation of Wagner's algorithm for the generalized birthday problem. (Note that the underlying problem is not exactly the Generalized Birthday Problem as defined by Wagner, since it uses a single list rather than multiple lists.) The proposed algorithm makes k iterations over a large list. For every factor of \\\\frac{1}{q} fewer entries per list, computational complexity of the algorithm scales proportional to q^{\\\\frac{k}{2}} for memory-efficient implementations. Alcock and Ren refute Equihash‚Äôs security claims, concluding that no tradeoff-resistance bound is in fact known for Equihash.

Even before all elements of the Royal Thai Volunteer Regiment had arrived in South Vietnam, efforts were being made to increase again the size of the Thai contribution. By mid-1967 the Thai government had unilaterally begun consideration of the deployment of additional forces to South Vietnam. On 8 September the Thai government submitted a request for extensive military assistance to the American Embassy in Bangkok. Specific items in the request were related directly to the provision of an additional army force for South Vietnam. The Thai Prime Minister proposed a one-brigade group at a strength of 10,800 men. This organization was to be composed of three infantry battalions, one artillery battalion, one engineer battalion and other supporting units as required. The deployment of the new headquarters began with the arrival of the advance party on 1 July 1968 and was completed on 15 July. The troops quickly followed. The first 5,700-man increment of the division, now known as the Black Panther Division arrived in South Vietnam in late July 1968 and was deployed in the Bearcat Base area. The second increment of 5,704 men began deployment in January 1969 and completed the move on 25 February. This increment contained the division headquarters and headquarters company (rear), the 2nd Infantry Brigade of 3 infantry battalions, 2 artillery battalions and the remainder of the division combat service support elements. The division was under the operational control of the Commanding General, II Field Force, Vietnam. The third increment was deployed to South Vietnam during July and August to replace the first increment, which returned to Thailand. The last of the third increment arrived at Bearcat on 12 August 1969. The replacement brigade assumed the designation of 1st Brigade. In addition, the headquarters of the Royal Thai Army Volunteer Force completed its annual rotation. In November 1970 the Thai government announced it was planning to withdraw its forces from South Vietnam by 1972. The decision was related to the deterioration of security in Laos and Cambodia and the growth of internal insurgency in Thailand, as well as the ongoing U.S. withdrawal of forces. The withdrawal plans were based on a rotational phase-out. The fifth increment would not be replaced after its return to Thailand in August 1971. The sixth increment would deploy as planned in January 1971 and withdraw one year later to complete the redeployment. On 26 March 1971 the Thai government announced to the United States and South Vietnam that half of the Division would be withdrawn in July 1971, and the remaining half in February 1972 in line with their earlier proposals. Following its return from South Vietnam the division was renamed the 9th Infantry Division based at (Fort Surasi, Kanchanaburi Province).

She spent the next few years in German concentration camps, but emerged from Ravensbr√ºck camp on 30 April 1945 having survived. Many did not. She wrote an autobiographical record of her experiences in 1958 but was unable to find a publisher: in 1982, two years before she died, the work was published, however.Hanna Sturm: Die Lebensgeschichte einer Arbeiterin; Vom Burgenland nach Ravensbr√ºck. Verlag f√ºr Gesellschaftskritik, 2nd edition, Vienna 1982  Life = Provenance and early years = Johanna Sturm was born at Klingenbach, a small town near Eisenstadt in Burgenland. Burgenland became part of Austria in 1921, but when Hanna Sturm and her siblings were born it was in the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian empire. She was the second of her parents' four children, and the only daughter among them. Her father worked as a carpenter. The family were members of what has come to be known as the Burgenland Croatian minority. She attended school for only two winters, between October and March, and then, there being no universal schooling provision operating in Hungary, started work in the fields when she was eight, later taking work in domestic service. When she was ten her father paid one gulden to a notary to confirm that she was twelve: that enabled her to get work at the sugar factory in nearby Schattendorf. After a year she gained a promotion which triggered jealousy on the part of other children working in the factory who filled her empty coffee flask with sugar syrop at the end of the day. The syrop was discovered in a check as she left work and she was dismissed for the presumed theft if it. When she was 14 she took a factory job with \\"Jute AG\\" in Neufeld, another small town in the area. With three other similarly aged children she worked on an industrial washing machine used in the processing of the materials. However, following a strike over \\"wages fraud\\" she was back on the streets. A few years later, in 1907, she accompanied her elder brother Julius to Vienna in search of factory work. = Labour activism in Vienna = In Vienna, through her brother, she got to know a Czech family who gave her her first job in the city. The father of the family was a union man: he was able to get her a job at the \\"Jute AG\\" factory in Floridsdorf, a growing industrial quarter across the river to the north of the main part of the city. (The factory was a sister plant to the one from which she had been dismissed in Neufeld.) At Floridsdorf she came into contact, for the first time, with the rapidly evolving labour movement. On 15 March 1908 Hanna Sturm joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei √ñsterreichs\\" / SP√ñ). On 8 March 1910 she joined a trades union: she remained a lifelong member. Encouraged and supported by her Social Democratic landlords, she learned to read and write. Vienna faced a general strike in 1911. Hanna Sturm took part in a large demonstration along the \\"Ringstra√üe\\" (Ring Boulevard) around the city centre. Police applied \\"rigour\\" to their handling of the demonstrating worker. Because she was distributing leaflets, Sturm received a powerful blow to her face, leaving her eyes bloodshot. Participation in the demonstration also led to the loss of her job with \\"Jute AG\\", and a further period of unemployment. = Motherhood and war = The birth of her daughter, Theresia, on 7 October 1912 exposed Sturm to the discrimination and additional practical difficulties commonly visited on an unmarried mother. During the First World War she was sent to work in a munitions factory at Blumau (Felixdorf), to the south of Vienna. In August 1916 she was arrested for alleged sabotage and spent a time in investigative custody. She was accused of filling explosives shells with sand rather than explosives. Eventually her case came to trial and was dismissed for lack of evidence. She found another job. Sturm had been sending most of her money to her mother, Anna, who was looking after her two daughters. The father of the girls never came back from the war. She was still separated from her daughters in 1919 when the younger of them, Relli, died in a Vienna hospital. Sturm was deeply affected but carried on. She took part in preparations for the \\"January strike\\" of 1918, called to press for improved conditions for the women workers and an end to the war. This led to her further arrest, but this time she was released very soon due to the sparseness of the evidence against her. = The 133 day soviet = The rapid collapse of the empire in October/November 1918 left Hungary separated from Austria, with present-day Burgenland on the Hungarian side of the impromptu frontier. Identified in her papers as a Burgenland Croat, Sturm now found herself classified as an alien in Vienna: she had to return to the region of her birth. She was a supporter of the Hungarian Soviet proclaimed by B√©la Kun on 21 March 1919. Characteristically, her support was practical. She worked as a courier, delivering to pre-assigned locations significant consignments of cash that had been collected for the Hungarian Red Army. On one occasion she was spotted by the police, arrested and taken to Zalaegerszeg. After three days she managed to escape, but at the new frontier-crossing at Neufeld she was recognised by the frontier guards and re-arrested. She was \\"imprisoned\\" in the second class waiting room at the station. She managed to climb out of a window without being spotted and ran across the fields to Ebenfurth which was \\"still in Austria\\". The Hungarian Soviet collapsed in the face of foreign military interventions at the beginning of August 1919 and Sturm turned to organising illegal border crossing for the leaders as they fled. One of those she helped was B√©la Kun, who had led the short-lived soviet. She hid him in her apartment for three days without recognising him, but as he left he disclosed his identity. = Years between two wars = In August the region comprising modern Burgenland was removed from Hungary and transferred to Austria, both countries being by this point internationally recognised as separate independent states. Sturm could finally return home to Neufeld without difficulties. She found work in the town's jute factory, soon becoming a member of the work's council. Sturm remained politically engaged in the post war years. She took particular trouble in respect of Catholic Croatian female co-workers whom the employers repeatedly used as \\"strike breakers\\". As one source expresses it, Hanna Sturm succeeded in bringing the women workers involved round to solidarity based on a class-conscious way of thinking. In 1924 she travelled to Moscow as an Austrian delegate to an international Comintern conference. She was able to meet high-profile political activists from various countries: comrades with whom she shared a table at the conference included Sun Yat-sen and his young wife with whom, as she later reported, she was able to discuss in German a range of topics that went beyond politics. There was also a reunion with B√©la Kun who \\"recognised her immediately\\". Back home there had been two big strikes by the women workers in pursuit of wage demands in 1925, after which, on getting home from Moscow, Sturm was unable to find work. In the immediate term she started organising unemployed workers in the area, becoming chair of the Unemployed Committee in Eisenstadt, the capital of Burgenland, although personalley, with only very limited financial support, she was under pressure. She also found herself in conflict with the SP√ñ party leadership. The party chairman, Otto Bauer, went on record with the punning observation \\"Wir lassen uns die Sturm nicht √ºber den Kopf wachsen\\" (loosely \\"We should not let this storm overwhelm us.\\"). In 1925 (or, possibly 1927 ‚Äì sources differ), in the context of continuing differences with the party leadership, Sturm was excluded from the Social Democratic Party. This development she took as an opportunity to join the Austrian Communist Party. Still unable to find work in her home region, where her political activities seem to have become common knowledge among factory owners, in 1929 Hanna Sturm moved with her adolsescent daughter Theresia to Bremen in Germany where the two of them found work in a textiles factory. The period was one of growing political polarisation in Germany: in that year's works council elections at the factory where they worked 12 out of 15 of the workers elected to the works council were communists, a result to which Hanna Sturm's \\"politicisation\\" of her comrades may well have contributed. Soon after that mother and daughter were expelled from Germany. Back in Burgenland a further period of unemployment followed. In 1930 the labour exchange sent Hanna und Theresia Sturm, together with a group of unemployed miners, to Moscow. Half a year later they were both employed, not in Moscow but as instructors at the \\"Rabotnica\\" textiles factory in Leningrad, training apprentices and other young recruits over three shifts how to work the spinning machines. = Back to Austria: but Hanna's daughter Theresia stayed in the Soviet Union till 1957 = In Autumn 1932 the party recalled Hanna Sturm to Austria. Theresia stayed behind, studying Applied Economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\") at Leningrad University. She also had an office job with the international sailors' club which is how she met her first husband, a German sailor whom she married in 1932. Subsequently her husband was arrested, Theresia herself being arrested a year after that, probably in both cases because they refused to apply for Soviet citizenship. Theresia spent more than twenty years in internal exile in the Ukhta area the Komi People's Republic. She nevertheless survived, and in 1957 was able to move with her Yugoslav born husband and her four children to Zagreb, where they built a new life. A Fascist government took power in Austria in 1934 and, encouraged by developments in Germany the previous year, rapidly transformed the country into a post-democratic dictatorship. Sources are for the most part silent about political activities undertaken by Hanna Sturm during the rest of the 1930s. It is recorded that she was detained by the authorities on four occasions between 1933 and 1937 for terms of between four and twenty-four days. At some stage she was excluded from the Austrian Communist Party, though it is not clear whether this was before or after the party was banned. She remained, in any case, a member of the Soviet Communist Party. = Ravensbr√ºck = Austria was merged into Nazi Germany in March 1938 and the repression of known anti-Nazis became more systematic. That same month Sturm was arrested again, this time by the Gestapo. By June 1938 she had been taken to Lichtenburg concentration camp in central Germany, between Leipzig and Berlin. She fell ill but recovered, setting up a small team of \\"fixers\\" ‚Äì the so- called \\"Sturm column\\", who made themselves useful by mending broken fixtures in the camp, thereby winning a level of respect from the para-military guards who would let the \\"Sturm column\\" into their own parts of the camp in order to effect repairs and, at the same time, steal food. Slightly less than a year later, in May 1939, the concentration camp at Lichtenburg was closed and the women inmates were transferred to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, to the north of Berlin. Glimpses afforded by sources suggest Sturm was not broken by the system. There is a reference to her as \\"the Austrian communist and jack-of- all-trades [who would] teach \\"students\\": how to put up fences, bang in nails, and break up locks\\", and later, slightly unexpectedly, of how she would \\"hold discussions on Leo Tolstoy‚Äôs War and Peace...in the back of block 13. ... Students [might] find the book highly repellent since Hanna [had] found the book in the latrine.\\" At Ravensbr√ºck she also continued to operate her \\"Sturm column\\" of hands-on fixers and menders. She came to be regarded by the camp authorities as a \\"reliable prisoner\\" and was employed in 1941 as a domestic servant by Walter Sonntag, the concentration camp doctor. She would later recall how she had been present while Sonntag beat his wife, too drunk to notice or to care that Sturm was standing by. = The survivor = As the war ended, on 30 April 1945 Hanna Sturm emerged badly traumatised from the concentration camp. It would be more than another ten years before her surviving daughter and four grand children would be released from the Soviet Union and the immediate priority was simple survival. She returned to Burgenland. There was no victims' welfare for concentration camp survivors till 1948, and in the early postwar years she suffered material hardship, while as a member of an inconvenient ethnic minority, the Burgenland Croats, she remained something of an outsider as the new Austria, still under foreign military occupation, struggled to emerge from its painful recent history The concentration camp existence lived on in her dreams. But she did not give up. She testified several times at trials of former Ravensbr√ºck camp guards. In Neufeld, her home town, she built a house with her own hands. She had prepared her autobiography by 1958, but it would take another 24 years before she found a publisher for it. In 1984 Hanna Sturm died at her daughter's family home in Zagreb.

Career=Juniors= Adams first national championship appearance was at the 1995 Canada Winter Games where she played for New Brunswick, winning a bronze medal. She also won two New Brunswick High School championships in 1993 and 1994. Adams would then go on to skip New Brunswick at three straight Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At the 1996 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, Adams led her New Brunswick team of Nancy Toner, Brigitte McClure and Bethany Toner to a 6-6 round robin record, missing the playoffs. At the 1997 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, she led her team to an improved 7-5 record, but again missed the playoffs. At the 1998 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, she led her team to a 10-2 round robin record, good enough for second place. In the semifinals, she beat Prince Edward Island's Suzanne Gaudet rink and then in the finals, she beat Ontario's Jenn Hanna to claim the championship. Adams would then represent Canada at the 1998 World Junior Curling Championships. There, she led her team to a 7-2 round robin record, in second place.

It contains a collection of Portuguese musical instruments and other items, as well as a music documentation centre, and is also used for recitals. The building A Portuguese guitar at the Museum The attractive building that houses the museum was commissioned in 1918 by Jorge O'Neil, a Portuguese / Irish aristocrat connected to the tobacco industry. O‚ÄôNeill was also responsible for the construction of the Tower of San Sebasti√°n and the Casa de Santa Maria, both in neighbouring Cascais. Originally known as the Torre de S. Patr√≠cio (Saint Patrick Tower), the building was designed by the Portuguese architect Raul Lino. It is considered an excellent example of a Revivalist approach that includes Neo-romanticism, and one of the main examples of the so-called summer architecture, used to describe some buildings constructed in the Estoril and Cascais area from the mid- 19th Century. Its interior is decorated with painted stucco, stained glass and 18th century tiles. Around 1942, Enrique Mantero Belard acquired the building, making a number of changes in the house and in the garden. His wife, Gertrudes Verdades de Faria, promoted social gatherings and cultural events, and was a patron of the arts. In his will of 1974, in addition to leaving significant sums to the charity Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia de Lisboa, he left the house to the Municipality of Cascais, to be named after his wife and used as a museum and public garden. The museum opened in 1987 and it was extensively remodelled in 2005. However, it has been criticised for insufficiently recognising the archaeological and artistic heritage of the building in presenting the museum's contents. A hurdy-gurdy The museum A large part of the museum's collection of popular string, wind and percussion musical instruments used in Portugal was put together by the Corsican musician and ethnologist Michel Giacometti, who spent much of his life studying Portuguese folk music. The collection of 381 instruments was acquired by the Cascais Municipality in 1981, together with some ethnographic items. Giacometti was on the committee to set up the museum, with the collaboration of the Portuguese Institute of Cultural Heritage and the Portuguese Museum of Ethnology in Lisbon. Giacometti‚Äôs library was also acquired, allowing the creation of the documentation centre of the Museum. In 1994, the composer Fernando Lopes Gra√ßa, who had previously worked closely with Giacometti on his research, left many items to the Municipality of Cascais in his will and these were incorporated in the museum in 1995. At this time the museum took on its present name. More recently, it has also incorporated a collection acquired from the conductor √Ålvaro Cassuto. Instruments to be seen are guitars, mandolins, accordions, flutes, bagpipes, concertinas, drums, tambourines, and idiophones, such as castanets, ferrinhos, and lamellophones. The documentary collection includes the personal libraries of Giacometti and Lopes-Gra√ßa, together with the field and bibliographical collections of Giacometti. Additionally it contains Lopes-Gra√ßa's musical work, considerable correspondence, and photographs, together with the library of Portuguese music by Cassuto.

Found by Lieutenant William Gair in Sevastopol after a year-long siege, he is said to have led British forces to valuable caches of hidden supplies that helped ease starvation among the troops. Gair brought Tom back to England after the war but the cat died soon afterwards. He was stuffed and presented to the Royal United Services Institute. A cat bought in a flea market in the 1950s resides in the collection of the National Army Museum and is sometimes described as being Tom, but there is no proof it is the same cat.  Life  During the Crimean War British and French forces captured Sevastopol from the Russians on 9 September 1855 after an almost year-long siege. Lieutenant William Gair of the 6th Dragoon Guards, who was seconded to the Field Train Department as a deputy assistant commissary, led patrols to search the cellars of buildings for supplies. Gair noticed a cat, covered in dust and grime, that was sitting on top of a pile of rubbish between two injured people. The cat, unperturbed by the surrounding commotion, allowed himself to be picked up by Gair. The cat, estimated to have been 8 years old when found, had survived within the city throughout the siege. Gair took the cat back to his quarters and he lived and ate with a group of British officers who initially named him Tom and later Crimean Tom or Sevastopol Tom. The occupying armies were struggling to find supplies, especially of food, in a city much-deprived by the year-long siege. It is said that the officers noticed how fat Tom was getting and realised he must have been feeding off a good supply of mice nearby. Knowing that the mice may themselves have been feeding off hidden Russian supplies, they followed Tom to an area cut off by rubble. Here, they found a storeroom with food supplies that helped to save British and French soldiers from starvation. Tom later led the officers to several smaller caches of supplies near the city docks. After the war ended Gair brought Tom back with him to England to keep as a pet but the cat died on 31 December 1856.  Legacy  A Welcome Arrival, 1855, John Dalbiac Luard, 1857 Gair had Tom stuffed and presented to the Royal United Services Institution. A stuffed cat purchased at the Portobello Road market by Lady Faith Compton Mackenzie in the 1950s was identified as Crimean Tom but there is no proof it is the same cat. It was donated to the National Army Museum in 1958 and is on display there; however, they have not been able to confirm whether or not this is Crimean Tom. Tom has popularly been identified as the cat asleep on a table next to a wood stove in the oil painting A Welcome Arrival, 1855 by John Dalbiac Luard, an 1857 work depicting British officers opening packages sent from home. It has been suggested that Gair is the red-coated figure at the left of the piece. The National Army Museum write, however, that \\"there is no evidence to substantiate any of these claims\\".

Examples Unidentified flying objects have long been reported through history, but the claimed craft are always a perversion of the technology or fiction of the day, and \\"the UFO technology tracks what our culture has but rarely exceeds it by a great deal.\\" When aviation was limited to hot-air balloons, UFO reports consisted of claims of mysterious airships. Reported in the 1890s, these airships were distinguished from our technology by their giant size, but they nevertheless needed propellers. The later flying saucers were also a weird version of then- current aerospace technology; as John Spencer notes in The UFO Encyclopedia: \\"Witnesses aboard flying saucers have reported, for example, chunky number counters on the saucer control panels, but we did not have reports of liquid quartz readouts until we ourselves invented them.\\" Reports also track the science fiction prevalent at the time. Claims of UFOs stopping car engines and lights did not appear until a similar effect featured in the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still. Similarly, the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind had the effect of standardizing accounts of grey aliens with entirely black eyes, though these were the invention of the film's special effects man, Carlo Rambaldi. Explanations Cultural tracking appears to discredit a simple extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) as an explanation of UFOs. The psychosocial hypothesis (PSH) rejects the idea that UFOs are alien craft, and posits the simplest explanation: the UFOs and their occupants are imaginary. However, some believers in alien visitation embraced the idea of cultural tracking, claiming that advanced \\"ultraterrestrials\\" are capable of deliberately changing how they appear to humans. Advocates of this \\"interdimensional hypothesis\\" (IDH) believe that these beings might sometimes present themselves in the manner of 1950s sci-fi, but they could also appear as fairies, angels, ghosts or any other supernatural beings. However, they may disagree as to the aliens' motives for doing this. Jacques Vallee in the book Passport to Magonia, and John Keel, in his 1970 book Operation Trojan Horse, are sometimes seen as the instigators of this trend.

Initially two sets of operations by 2nd Special Air Service, they were eventually amalgamated into one. Their objective was to disrupt German lines of communication, coordinate the activities of the French Resistance and prevent German reinforcements moving to the Normandy beachheads. They operated from the Loire valleys, then mostly in the For√™t de Ch√¢tillon area in Burgundy and finally through to the forests of Darney to Belfort. The operation, which lasted six weeks in all, ended as they linked up with the US Seventh Army. The operations turned out to be the most successful of all the post D-Day SAS operations.Mortimer pp.144-46 Background The Special Air Service (SAS) was a unit of the British Army, formed in July 1941 by David Stirling and originally called \\"L\\" Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade\\"L\\" being an attempt at deception implying the existence of numerous such units. In 1944 the Special Air Service Brigade was formed and consisted of the British 1st and 2nd Special Air Service, the French 3rd and 4th Special Air Service and the Belgian 5th Special Air Service.Shortt & McBride, p.15 They used specially converted American made Jeeps armed with a number of Vickers K guns, and proved so successful they kept them on.Thompson, L. p. 37 In May 1944 the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) had issued an order for the Special Air Service Brigade to carry out operations in France. They were to undertake parachute operations behind German lines in France, and then carry out operations supporting the Allied advance through Belgium the Netherlands, and eventually into Germany. The focus of these would be the disruption of German reinforcements from the south of France to the Normandy beachheads.Kirby pp. 17-19 The SAS also hoped to be assisted by the French resistance and reinforcements would arrive by air as too would supplies which included the specially equipped Jeeps.Hargreaves pp 79-80 With the allied breakout in Normandy in August a number of operations were initiated. The Burgundy region was the hotbed for SAS activity partly because it was the centre point at which Germans armies would funnel their way out of France into Germany. Operation Houndsworth would set up a patrol base in the mountainous wooded countryside south west of Dijon in the Monts du Morvan.Young, p.161 Operation Hardy would do the same in the For√™t de Ch√¢tillon area forty miles east of Auxerre to the northwest of Dijon.Gilbert p. 573 Hardy & Wallace Roy Farran (seated right) in a Jeep during Operation Wallace-Hardy August - September 1944 On 27 July Operation Hardy commenced - 55 men and seven Jeeps of 2nd Special Air Service under the command of Captain Grant Hibbert were parachuted near Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine. They set up their base in the nearby forest and linked up with local elements of the French resistance. The previous month however 2,000 Germans swept the region and killed 37 Maquisards many of whom had been tortured. Nevertheless Hibbert all too aware of the situation undertook reconnaissance of the German strength and dispositions in the area. Despite being under orders not to engage the Germans, many of his men undertook aggressive patrols against rail and road communications over which reinforcements could be moved. Crucially they blew up a stretch of railway between Dijon and Langres and decimated a German convoy which was heading towards the Normandy front. With the Allied breakout in Normandy, it was realized that more and more Germans would be retreating through the area of SAS operations. In addition the German reinforcements for Operation Dragoon in the South of France, would also be diverted through the region as well as its retreat. As a result the area was to be reinforced by more SAS troopers along with members of SOE. Reinforcement parties and supplies were dropped in the same area on 8, 17, 20 and 23 August, and late in the same month the Hardy party would be joined a bigger operation - codenamed Wallace. The C√¥te-d'Or area where Operation Wallace-Hardy took place On 19 August Operation Wallace commenced, under the command of Major Roy Farran, sixty men landed with 20 Jeeps at Rennes airfield near the Breton capital, which was by then under Allied control. Two days later Farran divided his party into three groups, and ordered them to maintain a distance of thirty minutes to increase the chances of not being discovered, as well as avoiding all German resistance. The journey to Hibbert's position took Farran and his men four days and some behind German lines and headed to the northern bank of the Loire river. The first fifty miles were uneventful, as local French resistance fighters were able to help the SAS troopers avoid German positions.Rousselet pp.25-29 Soon after a number ran into Germans in the villages and towns, and most had to fight their way out.Challenor & Draper p. 106 A number of jeeps were lost as well as eight men; some escaped and even had to get their way back to Paris and join Farran by parachute at a later date.Thompson, J pp. 330‚Äì331 Now left with only seven of his original Jeeps, Farran pressed on, and as they approached the forest the column halted near a railway line. A train carrying Germans came into view; Farran ordered the engine to be targeted and it was shredded by a ferocious rate of fire from the column's Vickers K guns. The damaged engine came to a halt as the SAS men engaged the German troops in the rear of the train while the French civilians including the engine crew bailed out.Thompson, L. p. 78-79 As they approached their final destination they assaulted a German radar station and forced the German garrison to flee. Prisoners taken informed the SAS troopers that they believed the Jeeps to be the advance guard of General George S. Patton's United States Third Army. Eventually the party linked with Hibbert's men at the Hardy base. Farran took command of the combined group, which consisted of a composite squadron of 60 troopers, 10 jeeps and a civilian truck, and ordered it to move to another base deeper in the forest to avoid further German scrutiny. =Battle of Ch√¢tillon= Town of Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine With the combined force an attack was decided to be made on the German headquarters in the town of Ch√¢tillon-sur- Seine. This town was strongly held by the Germans. An earlier meeting with Farran and the commander of the local resistance forces over a wine-fuelled dinner apparently secured an agreement that the resistance forces would aid the men of the SAS.Challenor & Draper p. 112 On September 2, in the early hours of the morning just before the attack however, there was no sign of any resistance support. Farran decided to go ahead with the attack in case of a betrayal by the French and whilst surprise was still on his side. Under the cover of darkness, Farran placed his Squadron in position, covering all the entry and exit points of the town with jeeps, machine guns or mortar positions. At 0630 hours the attack was opened with 3-inch mortar fire on the ch√¢teaux which was the German headquarters. 48 mortar bombs were dropped on the designated targets and the SAS encountered strong resistance from the German troops in the town as a huge firefight broke out. German vehicles were set ablaze and many were cut down. Outside the town a reinforcement column of 30 vehicles full of troops was dispersed, and prevented from giving help to the garrison. After seven and a half hours of hard fighting, Farran ordered a withdrawal to their base. The ambush was a major success for the SAS; around 100 Germans were killed and a considerable number wounded. In addition nine trucks, four cars and one motorcycle were destroyed. SAS casualties were trifling - one killed and two wounded. After the fighting, the Germans took fifty hostages thinking that this attack came from the Resistance. However the discovery of the body of one killed SAS trooper named William Holland, deliberately left by Farran, prevented their execution.Lewis pp 138 Farran soon became popular with the French locals who offered his men wine, flowers, eggs and butter.Macintyre p 18 =End= The following night after the battle the SAS received a large drop from the RAF with needed supplies, ammunition but more importantly several Jeeps by parachute, bringing their total to 18 such vehicles. Farran then split his force into two columns of nine vehicles, one of these columns being led by Hibbert and the other by Farran himself, and headed for the Belfort Gap, an area between the Vosges mountains and the Swiss border. German forces were retreating to the area to try to prevent the Allies from reaching the Rhine river. The two columns set off on 2 September, heading for the gap between Patton‚Äôs US Third Army in the north and Patch‚Äôs US Seventh Army in the south. German numbers increased as more and more retreated but the SAS columns ambushed more German units over the following two weeks. On 8 September twenty men under Lieutenant Bob Walker-Brown acting on a tip off from the Marquis ambushed five German petrol bowsers en route from Langres to Dijon. In an ambush style a motorcycle and side car and a lorry were allowed past before the lead and last vehicles were hit as the bowsers were systematically taken out and then burst into flames. With all the bowsers destroyed and having created huge palls of smoke the SAS extracted themselves successfully. In the final week the SAS set up a base in the forest around Darney but in the coming days the Germans were fewer in number and there was hardly any resistance. Wallace came to an end on 17 September, when the groups linked up with advance elements of the US Seventh Army not far from Belfort. Aftermath During the month they had been active, the SAS men had caused more than 500 German casualties along with 23 staff cars destroyed, 6 motor- cycles and 36 miscellaneous vehicles including trucks, half-tracks and troop carriers. In addition 100,000 tons of petrol was destroyed and a goods train burnt out. Seventeen SAS troopers had been lost including one in a parachuting accident, two had been captured but both escaped. Jeep losses were the heaviest, 16 were lost in all, some down to mechanical failure and fatal damage by parachute drops. Throughout their entire time behind German lines they were supplied by the Royal Air Force in 36 sorties, which supplied the SAS with twelve new Jeeps and 36 supply panniers. The Germans mistook Farran‚Äôs Squadron for the advance elements of the 3rd U.S. Army and thereby withdrew from Ch√¢tillon sooner than necessary, and that his small force played a considerable part in disorganising the German forces in front of that army. In a December report SHAEF noted that the raid was one of the most successful actions in which a small scale harassing force behind German lines inflicted huge damage out of proportion to their numbers, with minimal losses. Farran himself claimed the raid as a perfect vindication of Stirling's original principles of the SAS - that small units behind enemy lines harassed the Germans that bought with it a strategic gain.Mortimer p 147 After linking up with American forces, Farran sent the squadron back to Paris and granted it a week's leave in the capital. Farran was awarded a Distinguished Service Order as result of Operation Wallace. Farran and his men retrained and then re embarked to join the Italian Campaign where they prepared for Operation Tombola the following year in March which was also a resounding success.

The five hundred mile flight suffered a loss of control as a result of a malfunction of its elevator, causing it to crash as it made its final descent into Moscow. At the time of the crash it was the worst accident in aviation history involving a Tupolev Tu-124, since it entered service with Aeroflot in 1962.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-124V, registered CCCP-45061, to Aeroflot. The Tu-124V was a variant of the original Tu-124 which had been introduced in 1962. The 'V' variant of the Tu-124 modified the aircraft to be able to seat 56 passengers, instead of the original 44, and also had increased range and payload capacity. CCCP-45061 was equipped with two Soloviev D-20P turbofan engines and had first flown in 1964. It was assigned to Aeroflot's Lithuania division. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained 14,903 flight hours and 13,832 pressurization cycles. Crew and passengers Six crew members were aboard Aeroflot Flight 2022. The flight crew consisted of: * Captain Stepan Boyko * Co-pilot Eugenijus Karnila * Navigator Juozas ƒåasas * Flight engineer Yuno Shamaev * Stewardess Maria Cricova The crew also included a junior police lieutenant as a sky marshal (they were added after the hijacking of Aeroflot Flight 244 in 1970). All of the passengers were Soviet citizens, with the exception of one who was a West German citizen. Majority of the passengers were Lithuanians. They included four noted Lithuanian pediatricians, including , who traveled to a medical conference in Kharkiv. Bodies of the victims were cremated in Moscow on 21 December. The four doctors were buried in a public ceremony attended by Lithuanian First Secretary Antanas Snieƒçkus in Antakalnis Cemetery. Accident At 18:10 MSK on 16 December 1973, CCCP-45061 took off from Vilnius Airport in Lithuania SSR and proceeded east on a flight to Moscow- Vnukovo Airport in Russia with six crew and 45 passengers on board. Flight 2022 climbed to a cruising altitude of 7,800 meters (25,600 ft) and at 19:03 MSK air traffic controllers in Moscow gave the pilots clearance to begin a descent to 5,700 meters (18,700 ft). At 19:11 MSK the pilots reported the aircraft had entered a steep dive and were having difficulties recovering. Just 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) above the ground the pilots were able to briefly stabilize the aircraft however it then entered a stall followed by a spin. At 19:13 MSK the aircraft crashed into the ground near the village of Karacharovo, northwest of Moscow. All 51 people aboard the aircraft were killed. At the time of the crash, visibility was reported to be 2-4 kilometers with haze and cloudy skies. Cause An investigation ruled out engine problems or weather having playing a part in the crash. In addition, there were no physical jams in the aircraft's rudder, aileron, and wing trim tab components. Investigators determined that a spontaneous short circuit had caused the elevator trim tab to deflect to and maintain an upward position. As a result, the pilots lost horizontal control and entered into an irrecoverable dive.

History  It was conceived after a 2012 declaration by African heads of state as part of the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) that called for innovative solutions to facilitate infrastructure delivery. Africa50 was ratified by African Finance Ministers in May 2013, and its headquarters were launched in Casablanca, Morocco in September 2014. Its Constitutive General Assembly of founding shareholders took place in July 2015 in Casablanca, with around $700 million in initial capital subscriptions from 20 African states and the AfDB. 90% of the financial pledges were earmarked for project financing and the remainder for project development. At the first Shareholders Meeting in July 2016 two more African states and two central banks joined Africa50, and at the second Shareholders Meeting in September 2017 two more states joined, bringing the total to 25, and committed capital to over $800 million. The member countries are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, and Tunisia.  Functions  Africa50 uses equity investments to catalyze public sector and private sector capital into viable projects. Its primary sectors are energy and transport, but other sectors such as water, sanitation and IT are also considered. Projects should have a development impact in the host country while also offering a financial return. It has separate Project Development and Project Finance divisions and can thus work on the entire project cycle.  Projects  Africa50's first investment was in December 2016, with Scatec Solar and Norfund, for development of a 100 MWDC solar power plant in Jigawa state, Nigeria. The total project cost will be about $150 million, with operations to start in 2018. Its second investment was with the same partners in six solar plants totaling 400 MWDC in Benban, Egypt. Total project cost will be about $450 million. Financial close was reached on October 27, 2017. Operations should start in early 2019. The third project, signed in September 2017, is with the state electricity company of Senegal - Senelec - for a 120 MW power plant that will run on fuel oil but can be converted to natural gas once Senegal's reserves become available. Africa50 will assist Senelec to select the developer and mobilise financing.https://www.agenceecofin.com/centrale/2209-50489-senelec- africa50-s-associe-a-la-senelec-pour-developper-les-120-mw-de-la-centrale-de- malicounda  Management  Alain Ebobiss√© is CEO of Africa50 and Carole Wamuyu Wainaina is COO.

With the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the drill hall became the home of the 1st North Midland Brigade Royal Field Artillery as well as two of its three batteries (the third was at Main Ridge in Boston). The brigade was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 and, after being deployed to France and being re- designated 230th Brigade Royal Field Artillery in May 1916, it saw action during the Operations on the Ancre in early 1917, the Battle of Hill 70 in August 1917 and subsequent engagements.

RNRC is No 1 in terms of the authorized share capital (RUB 71 billion) and No 2 in terms of paid-in capital (RUB 21.3 billion) on the domestic insurance market. Central Bank of Russia is a full shareholder of RNRC. The state-owned reinsurance company was set up as provided for by Federal Law No. 363-FZ On Amendment of the Law of the Russian Federation \\"On Insurance Business in the Russian Federation\\" dated July 3, 2016 and Art.13.1-13.3 of Federal Law No. 4015-1 \\"On Insurance Business in the Russian Federation\\". The Company was set up by the Resolution of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation dated July 29, 2016 as Reinsurance Company NRC JSC (registered on August 3, 2016). NRC obtained reinsurance license PS No. 4351 on October 12, 2016. Company objectives The low capacity of the Russian reinsurance market provided by domestic reinsurers has been a long-term concern of reinsurance specialists and insurance authorities. It depends on the insurance type and has varied over time from $10‚Äì20 million for a single risk in 2005 to $100 million in 2015. Reinsurance is a global and cross-border business, however, a too large share of risks and reinsurance premiums were ceded abroad instead of Russia where they could be invested in the national economy. Sanctions imposed by the US and European Union have a detrimental impact on the ability to cede risks abroad even to reinsurers in the countries which formally do not support such sanctions. This was the case with risks from Iran after the imposition of economic sanctions against it. There are also insurance business lines featuring very low frequency, but very high losses amount, i.e. risks with very rare but tremendous losses. Such risks are very hard to insure or reinsure due to the unavailability of any statistics or data to determine underwriting rates. That risks for Russia include destruction of dams of major HEPPs, accidents involving expensive space or infrastructure facilities, grate forest fires (and as well human-made) in populated areas, devastating floods, etc. Some risks require state reinsurance support due to high social or economic importance but low attractiveness in terms of economic efficiency for a single insurer or reinsurer. They include a wide range of risks in agricultural insurance (e.g. coverage of losses related to African swine fever virus), housing insurance against catastrophic events (flood, forest fire, earthquake, etc.). Definite risks ‚Äî especially in case of mandatory insurance ‚Äî feature very specific underwriting procedures and regulatory framework in Russia, so they can‚Äôt be ceded to foreign reinsurers. In addition, a large number of risks may not be ceded abroad due to national security issues (e.g. if their reinsurance may lead to disclosure of state secrets) or economic security (insurance of state-guaranteed orders). To address the above issues and restrictions, the Russsain authorities represented by the Central Bank of Russia set up RNRC with objectives and tasks including: * Improvement of financial stability of Russian insurers (and, therefore, provision of better insurance conditions for the population and business); * Provision of reinsurance capacity for insuring businesses or facilities subject to foreign trade sanctions; * Provision of reinsurance protection for state-guaranteed orders, as well for risks not attractive from the commercial point of view which have high social, general economic, industrial or state importance; * Control over risk ceding by Russian insurers abroad, counteracting illegal capital outflow under the pretense of reinsurance operations. Elvira Nabiullina:Establishing a mega regulator for the Russian financial sector Activity RNRC delivers reinsurance solutions to Russian and foreign companies in non-life insurance industry on both a Treaty and Facultative basis. =Compulsory cession= From January 1, 2017, the provisions of Art.13.1-13.3 of Federal Law No. 4015-1 came into force that obliged all insurers to cede RNRC at least 10% in each reinsurance ceded, and RNRC to accept at least 10% of all the so-called sanction risks. While the RNPC may not accept any risks that are not subject to sanctions. =World-wide business= The development of international business is an important part of RNRC strategy.

History  The precise origins of Kerpen Castle are hidden by the mists of time. It is very likely that it was built by Sigibertus de Kerpene, first mentioned in 1136, or his son, Henry I (1142-1177). However, it is not yet possible to give an exact date of construction. In 1265, Theodoric II of Kerpen converted the castle into a fief of the Archbishop of Cologne, Engelbert II of Falkenburg. The estate was later divided between him and his brother, William II. In 1299, a 'Theodoric III' is recorded as Lord of Kerpen. His sons later founded the three family lines of Kerpen-Linster, Kerpen- M√∂rsdorf and Kerpen-Illingen (Lit.: Losse, 2003), who remained the owners of their ancestral castle and turned it into a jointly-owned inheritance or Ganerbenburg. In 1446, Conrad of Kerpen-M√∂rsdorf sold his share of the castle to his cousin, William II of Sombreff, who acquired another share in 1448. Together with his family inheritance, this made William the sole owner of the castle. After his death, there were ongoing disputes over Kerpen castle, which lasted for more than 200 years. William's son, Frederick, died childless, so that the castle fell to his sister, Margareta. Through her marriage to Count Dietrich of Manderscheid-Schleiden, the castle came into the possession of the count's family. At the beginning of the 16th century, Dietrich IV of Manderscheid-Schleiden had a castle chapel built in the Gothic style. When he died childless in 1593, his brother-in-law, Philip of the Mark, had Kerpen Castle occupied by those loyal to him in order to lay claim to the estate. The quarrel between him and Philip's widow ended in a settlement in 1611 and he bought Kerpen from the widow. But the property disputes were by no means over. In 1653, the Count of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim also tried to stake his claim to the estate by occupying the castle. It was not until 1674 that the dispute between the various noble families over Kerpen was brought to an end when the Imperial Chamber Court at Spires granted the estate of Kerpen and its castle to the Duchess of Arenberg. The Arenberg family remained owners until 1794, but never realised their initial plans to have the castle transformed into a schloss. In the Reunion Wars, some of the buildings of the castle were destroyed by French troops in 1682. During the Thirty Years' War, soldiers of the French army under General Bouffleur blew up the castle and village and razed them to the ground. After the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine by French Revolution troops in 1794, French administrators sold the ruin to the village in 1803 for demolition. In 1893, Johann Heinrich D√ºn took over the dilapidated estate. He had it freed of rubble, built the present residential house and put a new battlement on the bergfried. From 1907 to 1911, Kerpen Castle was owned by Clemens Manstein. In 1911, Eifel painter, Fritz von Wille, bought the castle from Clemens Manstein and had urgent safety and repair work carried out. When the artist died in 1941, he was buried in the castle grounds. In the same year, the company of DEMAG bought the castle to use it as a training centre. In the 1950s, the company carried out further measures to secure, modify and expand the castle. From 1969 to 2007, Kerpen was owned by the county of Neuss, who used it as a country hall of residence (Landschulheim). Then a Dutch family bought the property and underwent extensive renovation in 2010. Currently (2016) it is used as refugee accommodation.  Description  Kerpen Castle is built on a triple-terraced, hill spur, which is guarded to the north by a roughly 15-metre-wide neck ditch. The battlemented, 23-metre- high, bergfried stands on the first and highest terrace. On the top floor was once a dungeon. On the middle terrace there used to be domestic and outbuildings, which no longer exist. The only relic from medieval times is the 35-metre-deep castle well in a roundel. The lowest terrace is surrounded by an enceinte which is supported on heavy pillars. In the 17th century it house several outbuildings and castellan's houses before they were destroyed by the French in 1682.

It is a thin piece of land along the eastern edge of The Haven (a stretch of the River Witham), running southwards from the built-up area around Skirbeck (within Fishtoft's parish boundaries but separate from the village of Fishtoft) to a point just north of the junction where Hobhole Drain merges with The Haven; the reserve is mostly bounded to the east by fields, but is backed onto by residential and industrial buildings at Skirbeck and is adjacent to a sewerage works further south. It contains a mixture of rough grassland with scrub and brambles, cattle-grazed meadows, seasonal ponds, estuary, and mud flats. It also contains the Pilgrim Fathers' Memorial on the site (formerly called Scotia Creek) where a group of puritans were arrested in 1607 while trying to escape religious persecution. The reserve's main entrance is near Finn Forest's works on the industrial estate off Fishtoft Road, Skirbeck. Another car park is off Scalp Road in Fishtoft village.

Following the destruction of Washington US leadership considered removing the Federal Government from D.C., but eventually choose to reconstruct the seat of government in D.C. The Debate on Removing the Federal Government from D.C. From the beginning of the founding of the Nation, a heavily debated, political issue was the location of the governing body and subsequent capital of the United States. After many years, multiple relocations, rehashing of the argument, compromises, policy and one fire, the Burning of Washington, August 24, 1814, part of the War of 1812 it was concrete that the capital of America would long be Washington D.C. However, before Congress made the decision to keep the capital in Washington it debated to uproot it. = Compromise of 1790 = The location of the federal government was a result of the Compromise of 1790, the agreement that the capital would be placed below the Mason‚ÄìDixon line as a compromise to states assuming the Federal Government's Revolutionary war debt. The Compromise of 1790 was arranged between then Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Congressman James Madison, and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in June 1790. The compromise resulted in moving the capital from New York to Philadelphia (for ten years) and finally to Washington D.C.. Hamilton agreed to provide the votes in Congress for the capital while Jefferson and Madison ensured enactment of Hamilton's plan for the assumption of the Revolutionary War debts of the states by the federal government. A map of Washington D.C., Result of the Compromise of 1790. The plans for the new city to house the seat of government. = Locations of the Capital = Prior, the capital shifted up and down the northeast coast of the United States. Initially, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in 1774. After this, the body moved to Baltimore, Lancaster, PA, and York, PA. Between 1781 and 1788, Congress met in Philadelphia, Princeton, New Jersey, Annapolis, Maryland, Trenton, New Jersey, and New York. After Congress was legitimized by the Constitution, it met in New York, Philadelphia[5] and then finally after 1800, Washington D.C. = Debates between 1800-1808 = Between 1800 and 1808 Congressmen made several attempts to remove the federal government from D.C. At this time when travel was difficult and time consuming. Many congressmen felt that the capital should be somewhere ‚Äúwith greater security and less inconvenience‚Äù as well as being a more accessible location via a water way. A majority of both houses wanted to move the seat of government to Pennsylvania, either Philadelphia, a centrally located gateway to the West, or Lancaster. In 1804, Senator Robert White (judge) made the first motion to relocate the capital to Baltimore, MD. However, John Quincy Adams questioned the constitutionality of it. Adams claimed that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to ‚Äúrelocate the seat of government, only to govern it‚Äù and that to do so would be in direct violation of the formal clauses of the Compromise of 1790 - formally titled as ‚ÄúThe Residence Act‚Äù. In 1808, Representative James Sloan (congressman) of New Jersey argued that the cosmetics and atmosphere of Washington was not indicative of the nation as a whole and that Philadelphia, a shining political and social hub on the east coast, should be named the capital. In contrast, critics claimed, Washington was ill-planned with public buildings constructed poorly and faraway from each other. Moreover, it was poorly populated and lacked the romantic metropolitan aesthetic that New York and Philadelphia had at this time. After much debate, the motion for failed 51-35. = Destruction of Documents and Buildings = The British invasion on the capital in August 1814, created the opportunity to revisit the pros and con of removing the government from Washington. Crucial buildings and documents were destroyed that were vital to the governing of the nation. A portion of the Capitol Building was destroyed, and the U.S. Treasury was in ashes. The War and State Departments as well as the Navy Yard were scorched and infamously the White House was destroyed. At the Navy Yard, clerks were ordered to torch ships and ammunitions to prevent the British from seizing them. This collective blaze was reportedly seen as far away as Baltimore. The original library of the United States Congress was also destroyed in the fire. All 3,000 of the books housed in the library were destroyed. Less than a month later, Thomas Jefferson offered his private collection of 6,487 books as a replacement to Congress. The United States purchased his library for $23,950 in 1815, and it became the foundation of the modern collection of the Library of Congress. Shows British soldiers burning the White House Congress created the national archives in 1934. Prior, it required each executive department to keep its own archives. For example, the Department of State was in charge of preserving the nation's early state papers including the records of the Confederation and Continental Congresses, George Washington's papers as commander of the Continental Army, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. The papers were stored in boxes and trunks in attics of public buildings scattered throughout the city - at risk to weather, water, neglect, fire, theft. At the Department of State, clerks John Graham, Stephen Pleasanton, and Josias King saved the documents in custody. Bringing bags and trunks to load onto carts, they saved books and papers of the State Department, unpublished secret journals of Congress, George Washington's commission and correspondence, the Articles of Confederation, the papers of the Continental Congress, and treaties, laws, and correspondence dating back to 1789. Along with these early records, the clerks also saved the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights. First Lady Dolley Madison saved numerous Cabinet papers as well as Gilbert Stuart's famous Landsdowne portrait of George Washington. Yet a, majority of the archives of Congress stored in the Capital were destroyed. Due to lack of resources, people and time, it was simply too late. Some were spared, however. House clerks Samuel Burch and J. T. Frost moved House papers to a secret location and Senate clerk Lewis Machen took Senate documents to his farm in Maryland. The salvaged documents included military numbers and logistics, the Senate's history over the past quarter century, and various confidential papers. = Debate and Reconstruction = In order to rebuild and move forward, President Madison wrote to the Senate in September 1814. He authorized that Congress would convene in the Patent and Post Office building as it was the only government building to escape the attack: ‚ÄúThe destruction of the Capitol by the Enemy having made it necessary that other accommodations should be provided for the meeting of Congress, chambers for the Senate and for the House of Representatives‚Ä¶have been fitted up‚Ä¶in the Public Building heretofore allotted for the Post and other Public Offices.‚Äù Congress met there from September 1814 until December 1815. As soon as Congress convened, discussions on removing the government resumed. The Clerk of the Special Council, Thomas Bedfordfree[, pushed to remove the government temporarily to Philadelphia. However, the proposal was ultimately defeated by the House when it was put to a vote on September 26, 1814. Simultaneously, Philadelphia's city government offered their resources to the government and was willing to house them offering, ‚Äúsuitable places for their accommodation, as well as that of the other departments.‚Äù. A House committee was formed to investigate whether or not Washington was secure enough to house the government and if it was financially viable to rebuild. The committee ruled that a move to Philadelphia, either temporarily or permanently, would be ‚Äúinexpedient.‚Äù On October 3, 1814, there was a vote to change the deciding word from ‚Äúinexpedient‚Äù to ‚Äúexpedient‚Äù, the vote was split, 68‚Äì68, and Speaker of the House Henry Clay, broke the tie ultimately deciding that Washington D.C. would remain the nation's capital. District citizens built a temporary brick Capitol on the site of the present day Supreme Court of the United States for Congress to meet in.

Examples are characterized by caps made from overlapping lamellar scales, in addition to a brow plate, cheek guards, and camail. They are distinct from the contemporary spangenhelm and crested helmets also found in Europe; unlike those, which are influenced by Roman designs, Lamellenhelme display eastern influence and have primarily been found in southeastern Europe. They are mostly associated with the Avars of Pannonia and the Lombards of Italy. Description The Agiluf helmet plate Lamellenhelme are characterized by overlapping plates‚Äîa form of lamellar armour‚Äîwith caps of conical shape and plumes at the top. They also tend to have brow plates, cheek pieces, and, like spangenhelme, camail protecting the neck. A print of a lamellar helmet The Lamellenhelm was one of three primary designs of helmets that proliferated throughout 6th- and 7th-century Europe; the others were the spangenhelm and the northern crested helmet. They are categorized by Heiko Steuer with 'other helmets of eastern origin,' and have been principally found in southeastern Europe. Unlike spangenhelme and the northern crested helmets, which likely derive from Roman helmet designs, the Lamellenhelm appears to have been used by and influenced by eastern European cultures, such as the Avars. Lamellenhelme also seem to have been used by the Lombards, a Germanic people who ruled most of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774. This is suggested both by the discovery of parts of such helmets in Italy, and by the discovery of a brow plate displaying the inscription VICTORIA D[OMINO] N[OSTRO] AGILUL[FO] REGI, (\\"Victory to our lord, king Agiluf\\") which names Agilulf, a Lombard king who ruled from 591 to 616. The plate also contains a figural scene showing the seated king and, on his left and right, warriors who themselves are wearing comparable plumed helmets. The plate was once part of a helmet that was likely owned by a high-ranking follower of the king.

Gisella Giovenco  Biography  Church of Saint Thomas(Alcamo) A landscape of Portofino Venice: Palaces on the Canal Grande Gisella Giovenco was born in 1946 in Ferrara: her father, Onofrio, was a Sicilian doctor from Alcamo, while her mother, Afra Mariani, was originary from Ferrara; she has been living at Bogliasco (Genova) since 1948; she attended the Liceo Artistico Nicol√≤ Barabino in Genoa and had the painters Bassano and Alberto Nobile, and the sculptor Valdieri Pestelli as teachers.http://www.gisellagiovenco.it/Gisella_Giovenco_- _official_website_biografia.html She started painting in 1965, taking part in extemporaneous and collective exhibitions in Italy, France, Venezuela and USA; since 1968 she has almost exclusively set personal exhibitions in Genoa, Milan, Bergamo, Agrigento, Tokio, Osaka, Hiroshima, Hakata.http://www.sbaratto.it/index.php?route=product/product&product;_id=2288 In 1979 she is quoted in the ‚ÄúBolaffi‚Äù Catalogue, and in 1980 met Tito Fontana, a composer who wanted to put some painted landscapes to music; so in 1981 they realized the art show ‚ÄúSounds and colours‚Äù at the Galleria Cortina in Milan, where Tito Fontana composed a piece for each painting: all of them with a soundtrack, music and light synchronized on the work inside the gallery in the dark: painting and music together, telling the same emotions.http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/mosaico-stoffa-chiese.html Gisella Giovenco realizes different covers of jazz Lps for ‚ÄúStudio 7‚Äù and DIRE and collaborates in the realization of the pieces that Fontana composes to set Pope John Paul II‚Äôs poems to music which, after Sarah Vaughan‚Äôs concert held in D√ºsseldorf, becomes an LP. In the 1990s, she was a victim of chronic fatigue syndrome, after getting through the first stage of this disease but not in a perfect form yet, she can devote herself to painting, but as she keeps a dog and a cat at home and the oil canvases, leaning everywhere, are drying very slowly, in order to avoid any imaginable inconveniences, she invents a new personal technique by using the silk cuttings of the remainings from the creation of some of her fashion collections. So, what Vittorio Sgarbi will define cloth intarsias in his presentation of the volume ‚ÄúOmaggio alla Cristianita‚Äô ‚Äù, were born: a very detailed work looking for, among thousands of remnants, the desired shape and the right hue: the distinctive characteristics of silk give the possibility of getting some shades, variegations and chromatic reflections really original and unique in their kind. At Portofino she successfully tries out the first paintings with her technique, and in 2000 exhibits some 30 of them at Spazio San Carpoforo in Milan. The subjects represented by Gisella Giovenco, the churches‚Äô fa√ßades, are as original as their realization: a mosaic placed on a background painted in a uniform way, enriched by shiny silk pieces which highlight the preciousness of capitals and decorations, and produce an exceptional chromatic effect, very realistic but also different from photography. As her source of inspiration, Giovenco selects the subjects and images coming from the Holy Tradition and Christianity, that she considers authentic masterpieces and inestimable values of the Italian cultural patrimony, with the aim of enhancing them, making them as the absolute protagonists of her creations. According to the artist, only if you are aware of the importance of your own culture, you can respect and understand the others.http://www.milanoartgallery.it/art_GG_opere_esposte.php In 2005, in the parish Church of Bogliasco, with the collaboration of the Confraternity of Santa Chiara and the patronage of the municipality of Bogliasco, the artist exhibited some 40 of her paintings (both oil and intarsias), giving the proceeds of them to a cultural iniziative which was a matter of concern for many fellow citizens: the restoration of the fa√ßade of the ancient Oratory of Santa Chiara; the title given to this exhibition was 40 chiese per Santa Chiara (that is:forty churches for Santa Chiara). In 2009 she collected part of the 150 fa√ßades of the churches she had already ‚Äò‚Äôpainted‚Äô‚Äô in a book, entitled Omaggio alla Cristianit√†: the presentation was written by Vittorio Sgarbi and the preface by cardinal Angelo Bagnasco.http://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-pittrice-dona-sette-quadri-di-chiese- alla-citta-2/ In 2011, with the technique of Trompe-l'≈ìil, she painted three walls of the hall of the parish Church of Bogliasco and, with the same technique, the four sails of the ceiling of the veranda in Villa Crovetto (a senior home) in the district of San Bernardo in 2012. Finally, in December 2017, Gisella Giovenco decided to donate seven of her works to Alcamo, the hometown of his father, doctor Onofrio Giovenco, a pediatrician who practised his profession in Liguria, achieving notoriety for his scientific discoveries that were also published on international reviews, and for his long fight in favour of the reintegration of the yacht Elettra which belonged to Guglielmo Marconi. Stylist In 1983 she creates some collections of men‚Äôs leatherware and designs women‚Äôs handbags; between 1991 and 1992 she produces some collections of women‚Äôs fashion. Then Giovenco works together with Sergio Soldano‚Äôs atelier for the brand management, approaching the world of perfumes: three years later the result is a patent for the realization of perfumes personalized inside the shops at the time of sale, which was to be followed by a line of cosmetology personalized too; unfortunately the commercialization was suddenly stopped owing to her disease: chronic fatigue syndrome. = Activity as a publicist = In 1979 she met Renzo Cortina, the famous gallerist and bookseller from Milan who entrusted her with the live conduction of L‚Äôangolo del libro at Antennatre. Among some 30 of her guests she reminds Gina Lagorio, Nantas Salvalaggio, Giulio Bedeschi, Carlo Castellaneta, Alberto Lattuada, Romano Battaglia, Alberto Bertuzzi, Alberto Bevilacqua, Renato Pozzetto, Luciano Sechi and Paolo Mosca. In the ‚Äò80s she starts working for Il Giornale Nuovo in the fashion advertorials. Besides Indro Montanelli she meets Gianni Granzotto, Cesare Biazzi Vergani, Marcello Staglieno who let her feel at home. She also collaborates with the editorial board in Genoa. In 1987 Giovenco writes a series of interviews to famous personalities which is entitled Com‚Äôerano da piccoli -Infanzia e adolescenza di persone conosciute -.(How they were when children- infancy and adolescence of people known) Paolo Villaggio, Ornella Vanoni, Giorgio Soavi, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Gino Paoli, Ottavio Missoni, Bruno Lauzi, Ugo Gregoretti, Mino Damato, Walter Chiari, Carlo Castellaneta, Gianni Baget Bozzo, Enzo Biagi Alberto Bertuzzi, Pippo Baudo, Enrico Baj.

Pourjafar's execution sparked international outrage at the execution of juvenile offender who had barely become of age before his death, and renewed questions about the ethics of the death penalty.  Legal proceedings  In September 2016, Branch 7 of Criminal Court No. 1 in Tehran handed Pourjafar two death sentences, one for murder in accordance with the Shariah legal principle of qisas and another for rape. He was also sentenced to 74 lashes for mutilating Ghoreyshi's corpse by placing it in a bath of acid after her death. The Supreme Court upheld both death sentences in January 2017. Pourjafar had initially scheduled to be executed on 19 October 2017. Iranian law allows the execution of death row inmates who committed their capital offences as minors, however it does not allow the execution of those inmates before they turn 18. Although Pourjafar would have been 17 years, 10 months and 2 days old on 19 October 2017 according to the Gregorian calendar, the Iranian legal system initially did not stay his execution as he would have been of age according to the Islamic calendar (19 October 2017 was equivalent to the Islamic date of 29 Muharram 1439, at which point Pourjafar would have been 18 years, 4 months and 20 days old, according to the Islamic calendar.) Ultimately, the execution was called off following pressure from the United Nations. Assuming Pourjafar had been executed on this date, he would have been the fifth of six juvenile offenders executed in Iran in 2017. Pourjafar's execution was rescheduled to Thursday 4 January 2018, less than three weeks after his 18th birthday. Despite mounting criticism of his death sentence, he was hanged as scheduled at the gallows in Gohardasht Prison, Tehran at dawn on 4 January 2018.

Ancestors Frances Cannon Smith was originally from Virginia, and was a descendant from the Woodson who arrived in 1619 (or 1623), and settled finally in Goochland County, and from the Beckley, whose homestead was in King William County, near the house of the Carter-Braxtons. Porcher's great-great-grandfather, John J. Beckley, was elected Clerk of the House of the first United States Congress, which assembled in the city of New York, March 4, 1789, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, but which failed to secure the proper quorum (thirty members) until March 30. In those days the Clerk of the House was elected the same as the Speaker, and John Beckley served continuously until shortly before his death in 1807, with the exception of three years spent in assisting in the revision of the laws of Virginia. Frances Cannon Smith was the daughter of John Woodson Smith, born in Cumberland County, Virginia, on May 17, 1819, and died in St. Louis on October 5, 1888. He was the son of Sarah Hatcher, daughter of Col. John Woodson, Cumberland County, Virginia, who was a lineal descendant of Dr. John Woodson, of noble English birth, who came to Virginia with Sir John Harvey in 1621; Dr. Woodson was a surgeon to a company of soldiers, bringing his wife with him. His second son, Robert, married Elizabeth Ferris of \\"Curies,\\" a lineal descendant of the Dukes of Northumberland. From this marriage came Sarah Hatcher Woodson, fourth in line from Robert, a burgess active in colonial affairs. John Woodson Smith was one of the original \\"Forty-Niners\\" who crossed the plains to California; a major in the Confederate army in Vicksburg during the siege and served until the close of the war. He married, on May 17, 1843, Mary Frances, daughter of Rev. Edward Cannon, an eminent Methodist minister of Virginia (niece of Gov. Cannon of Tennessee), and wife, Jane Lasley, granddaughter of John J. Beckley, a confrere of Richard Henry Lee and Carter Braxton, with whom he served in the Virginia Assembly before the war. He was clerk of the Senate and House of Delegates in Virginia 1777-86; clerk of the Committee for Courts of Justice and the Committee of Trade 1776; Alderman of Richmond 1782; served three years in Virginia High Court of Chancery; legislator for Virginia and clerk of the U. S. Senate, serving until his death in Washington 1807. He came from the Beckleys or Bickleys of Devonshire, as shown by the arms he used. Byrd Smith, father of John Woodson, was born in Garrard County, Kentucky, on May 12, 1790, and died in Glasgow, Missouri, on February 12, 1872; he served in the war of 1812 and married, on June 17, 1818, Sarah Hatcher Woodson. His father, John Smith, born in Halifax County, Virginia, on June 23, 1764, and emigrated to Kentucky; he served there as Circuit Judge of the Pulaski District and in the legislature. He married in Virginia Mary Byrd. He was a son of Smith and wife, Mary English, and with his five sons served in the South Carolina campaign; at the battles of Eutaw Springs and Kings Mountain. His great granddaughter, Frances Cannon Smith, born in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1853, married, first, John Hall Roper; secondly, Thomas Davis Porcher, of Huguenot descent, from the Counts de Richebourg, a native of South Carolina, where his ancestor, Isaac Porcher (de Richebourg), settled 1680 with the Huguenot refugees from France. On the maternal side he was a great grandson of Stephen de Yeaux, who married Esther Giguillait; their only child, Stephen, married Anna Snowden, and their daughter, Georgianna Marie, married Octavius Theodore Porcher and had Thomas Davis Porcher. The widow of Stephen de Veaux, Esther, married Robert Marion, brother of Gen. Francis Marion, and upon their death her son, Stephen, inherited the famous plantation Belle Isle, the family seat of the Marions, as well as the large estate of the De Yeaux, known as \\"De Veaux Neck.\\" From Mary De Yaux, who married Gov Bullock of Georgia, came President Roosevelt. Biography When Frances Cannon Smith was young, her family moved to Missouri. She was educated at Pritchett College, Glasgow, Missouri, of which, at that time, her uncle, the Rev. Carr Waller Pritchett Sr., was president. Porcher graduated at fifteen years, making the four years' course in two. Later she married a schoolmate, John Hale Roper, son of the Mayor of Glasgow, who died 4 years after, after which her newspaper work began, as the result of an almost accidental happening. Roper wrote a satirical take-off on some questions that were being asked in the columns of a local paper, and a friend who was connected with the St. Louis Star, took it down and showed it to the editor, Gilbert, formerly editor of the New York Morning Journal, who kept and published it, and inquired whether she had ever done any journahstic work. He said he thought she might like it and sent for her, when she was immediately put on the staff to do special and society articles, and in that way she began her newspaper career. Her career lasted until her marriage to Thomas Davis Porcher. She remained on The Star several years. \\"Dan\\" Reedy ‚Äî the younger brother of William Marion Reedy ‚Äî and Roper began their work about the same time, and both being very inexperienced, were called the \\"kids\\" on \\"The Star\\" by the rest of the staff. Sometime before this, Augustus Thomas, the dramatic writer, was on one of the daily papers, and had written a column a day for forty days about the St. Louis Exposition, so upon being assigned to the Exposition a couple of years later, Roper thought she could do what anyone else could, and she, too, wrote a column a day for forty days, in addition to her regular writing, with the result that she suffered a breakdown in health. She then changed her work and took charge of the advertising department of D. Crawford & Co., and the Swope Shoe Company, writing the advertisements of these firms for the newspapers, making contracts with them, and in connection with this also did general newspaper work. About 1890 M. Fanning and Galvin founded The Mirror. Fanning was an old newspaper man and wanted to bring out a new weekly paper, and suggested to Roper that she take a position on the staff of that paper, which she did, starting with the first issue, but keeping up her advertising work for D. Crawford & Co. This combination eventually netted her an income of about $3,000 ($ in dollars) a year. For The Mirror she wrote short stories, gave a certain space to book reviews, dramatic criticisms and other departments each week. When Roper commenced her work on The Star, William Marion Reedy was the city editor. This was about 1888 or 1889. He gave her a great deal of encouragement, being the most generous and appreciative of editors, notably upon one occasion when she had written a political critique entitled Big Bugs' Ball, after the style of the Ingoldsby Legends. Later they were again associated when Reedy became editor of The Mirror. After Fanning left St. Louis to go to Ohio, Dyer, who had been editor with Fanning, retired, and Reedy took the editorship and The Mirror Company was formed, with Le Berthon as business manager. Roper continued as Reedy's assistant until her marriage in July, 1896 ‚Äî that was for about four years, after which she contributed at varying intervals to The Mirror up to 1912. She married Thomas Davis Porcher, born in Abbeville County, South Carolina and 16 years her younger,Thomas Davis Porcher at findagrave.com who was at the head of the book department of Stix, Baer & Fuller, having met him when he came from Chicago to open a book department for D. Crawford & Co. He then became superintendent of the book department of the Grand Leader Store. They had one son, Francis David Porcher, who attended the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington, Virginia. They lived at 1493 Stewart Place and later 5585 Bartmer Avenue, St. Louis. Porcher contributed, besides The Mirror, to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Republic; also to a few Eastern periodicals. While on The Mirror, Porcher wrote some extremely interesting short stories; sometimes she signed her initials, but oftener no name was attached. Her work was irregular ‚Äî just when in the mood ‚Äî but when one considers the great amount she accomplished, it is not surprising. The quiet life of domesticity she seemed to prefer, believing that it was impossible to struggle with the butcher and the baker and do good literary work. In 1913 she published a little story which was excellently conceived ‚Äî Mr. Perryman's Christmas Eve. Just a short story ‚Äî bound attractively in small book form ‚Äî an appropriate little Christmas gift. This was written in less than an hour. It was partly ideal, and yet she had known an old Scotchman of Mr. Malcolm's type whose appealed to her very much. It seemed to be ideal when she was writing it, but after its composition she felt that this man's life had suggested the story and that it belonged to him more than to her. Mr. Perryman's Christmas Eve is the story of an old man who has never been married, and is served by a faithful valet, who anticipates his every wish so completely that everything in his household is managed smoothly and skillfully, and he never has a worry or care. When the faithful attendant feels that he is no longer capable of keeping this up in his old efficient manner he trains a young Afro-American man, whom he has befriended since childhood; so when he quietly passes away the Afro-American man appears at the home of Mr. Perryman and announces himself as a \\"Christmas present\\" from \\"old Malcolm,\\" whose last thought had been for his master's comfort. His thorough training shows in the valet's perfect adjustment to his new position and duties, carrying out the thoughtful consideration of \\"old Malcolm\\" for every wish of Mr. Perryman. The flinty nature of the old gentleman had never been touched during the life of the faithful attendant as it was by this final forethought, and he yields at last to the nobler call which nothing else had stirred. When McCullagh was editor she wrote specials for the Globe-Democrat; he offered her the department that had been in charge of the Rev. Dr. Snyder, but was not willing to allow her to continue work on The Mirror at the same time, the result being that she continued to write specials only al intervals for McCullagh. One of the most- appreciated financial successes in her experience happened when she was doing the advertising work for D. Crawford & Co. She had her salary raised $260 ($ in dollars) a year for writing a saucy letter. Crawford saw the letter she had written to a solicitor and which was afterwards copied in a daily paper. That afternoon he called her in his office to say that she was worth $5 a week more to the firm, so for five years she received this extra amount, each week. During the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, a young man who had been sent there by the German Government as a representative, asked to have one of her stories translated for a magazine that was published in Berlin. She gave him permission to do so, and had forgotten about it, when a package was handed her two years later, in which she found a handsome leather case of a seal- brown color, to be used as a purse or for cards, with The Color of Her Eyes stamped upon it, this having been the title of the story. She was an officer of the Jefferson Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a member of the Society of Social Hygiene and of the National Child Labor Committee, and one of the Auxiliary Board of the Society for the Prevention and Cure of Tuberculosis. She was a conservative suffragist, believing in an evolutionary winning of the ballot, educational in its progress, preparing woman for her added civic duties and responsibilities. Her husband, Thomas Davis Porcher, died on September 19, 1914, in St. Louis, Missouri. and she moved to Los Angeles, California. She died herself in 1935 and is interred with her husband at the DuBose Old Episcopal Cemetery in Willington, South Carolina.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The church has a 15th-century tower and parts of the church date from even earlier. It was restored in 1864‚Äì65 by Sir Arthur Blomfield, while Charles Old Goodford was the incumbent. The parish is part of a benefice with Ashington, Mudford and Rimpton within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The stone building has hamstone dressing and clay tile roofs. It consists of a three-bay nave and three-bay chancel with a south porch. The three-stage west tower is supported by corner buttresses and has a small stair turret with a weathercock. The tower has five bells the oldest of which was cast in the 17th century. Inside the church are a 12th-century font and early piscina. The circular font is made of hamstone is lead lined and is in diameter. There is a wall tablet which is a memorial to Lieutenant Charles Goodford who died in World War I. Theophilus Brome, who died in 1670, had his body buried in the church, however his skull was separated from the body on his instructions and is kept in a cupboard at Higher Chilton Farm. According to writer Daniel Codd, who observed the skull in February 2010: 'Upon being shown Theophilus' skull, I was curious to see his lower jaw was missing and that he appears at some stage to have been varnished.' Codd goes on to say, 'The reason for Theophilus Brome's desire that his head be hidden was very natural, given the era in which he died, and his tomb in the church is concealed beneath the church wall nearest the farm ‚Äî meaning that his head and body were buried apart, but as near to each other as was possible under the circumstances.'Codd, Daniel (2011).

He was a specialist on the history of late antiquity and Early Middle Ages in Near East.  Career  Georges Tate studied at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud and received a doctorate in literature, then he taught history at the . He was secretary and then became director of the Institut d'arch√©ologie du Proche-Orient from 1980 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994, he was professor of ancient history at the University of Franche-Comt√©. He also held the position of Cultural Advisor in Baghdad. As a specialist in the East from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD, he has published numerous articles on Syria's rural economy and society from Roman times to the Byzantine Empire.  In 1096, Pope Urban II initiated the First Crusade (1095‚Äì1099) aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. From Godfrey of Bouillon to Saint Louis, for two centuries, Westerners from all social classes marched to conquer and defend the Holy Land. Religious convictions or political considerations? In the name of Christ, they slaughtered the infidels, took over Nicaea, Antioch, Tyre, Jerusalem, and founded the Latin States of the East. For Muslims, this epic of faith was a barbaric aggression. With the emir Imad ad-Din Zengi and Nur ad- Din, his son and successor, they proclaimed or holy war. The myth of the invincibility of the Franks was destroyed. Saladin, sultan of Egypt and Syria, was a fatal blow to Westerners who were permanently expelled from the Holy Land in 1291. Georges Tate retraces the stages of this bloody confrontation between two worlds in this small volume‚Äî (lit. 'The East of the Crusades'; UK edition ‚Äì The Crusades and the Holy Land; US edition ‚Äì The Crusaders: Warriors of God)‚Äîpublished by √âditions Gallimard in their collection. According to standards of the collection, the book is profusely illustrated with colour plates‚Äîillustrations taken from medieval illuminated manuscripts, maps, mosaics, frescoes, photographs, drawings, engravings, 19th-century paintings, etc.‚Äîand printed on glossy paper. This work is an attempt by the author to unravel, throughout its historical timeline, the true motivations for some of the bloodiest confrontations in human history. It contains five chapters: I, \\"The Mediterranean World on the Eve of the Crusades\\"; II, \\"The First Crusade\\"; III, \\"The Latin States of the East\\"; IV, \\"Zengi, Nureddin, and the Unification of Syria\\"; V, \\"Saladin's Victory\\". These are followed by a \\"Documents\\" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into ten parts: 1, The First Crusade; 2, The Taking of Jerusalem; 3, Hospitalers and Templars; 4, Jihad and Holy War; 5, Warfare or Military Science; 6, Portrait of Saladin; 7, The Franks in Eastern Eyes; 8, The Frankish Fortresses; 9, Lawrence of Arabia; 10, The Crusades: A Summing Up. The book closes with a chronology of the Crusades in the East, further reading, list of illustrations and index. It has been translated into American and British English, Brazilian and European Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, South Korean, Spanish, Turkish, simplified and traditional Chinese. Tate's book is not directed exclusively to experts but rather a work of popularisation, and accessible for the lay public. An innovative point here is the focus on an \\"Eastern\\" point of view, many of the sources and quotes are from Arab historians of the time or Jews, without giving up European sources on the subject. In this way the author explores in this work both Arab and European points of view.

The dairy was established as a public-private partnership with Estina, a Black Economic Empowerment company, as part of the Free State provincial government's agricultural project, Mohoma-Mobung. Estina was given the land under a free 99 year lease. The aim of the R250m dairy project was to empower black farmers however bank statements show that no payments were made to black beneficiaries. The dairy farm was just a shell through which money was sent to India. Allegations of corruption In mid-2013, investigative journalism published in the Mail & Guardian newspaper alleged corruption, flouting of treasury rules and mismanagement, and linked the project to the Gupta family and allies of President Jacob Zuma. Newspaper reports alleged that R30 million in government funds intended for the project were instead laundered through Dubai and used to pay for the 2013 wedding ceremony of Vega Gupta at Sun City, and accounted for as a business expense. In January 2018, City Press claimed that only 1% of the R220 million allocated to the dairy by the Free State government was spent on actual farming, with most of it being diverted to associates of the Guptas. Bank statements showed that the Free State government paid R334 million to the farm over 2 years, with the project transferring most of the money to its bank accounts in India, and only small amounts spent on the farm itself. In January 2018, the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the National Prosecuting Authority took control of the farm in a move against state capture, and seized R220 million that Free State Department of Agriculture under Mosebenzi Zwane had paid to the Gupta family, calling it a \\"scheme designed to defraud and steal monies from the department\\". The Hawks unit of South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) raided the offices of Ace Magashule, the Premier of the Free State, in connection with the project. Charges were laid against two state officials and a number of associates of the Gupta family. However, the National Prosecuting Authority provisionally dropped these charges in November 2018, citing lack of cooperation from authorities in India and the United Arab Emirates. In October 2018, one of the whistleblowers over corruption allegations in the project was found murdered. In October 2019, former Free State MEC for Finance Elzabe Rockman testified at The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, in relation to the provincial treasury's role in the project. Rockman claimed that she had met the Guptas multiple times and said that the project should have been put through an open tender process, as it was unknown to the department on why Estina had been chosen. =Public Protector report= In February 2018, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane released a report finding irregularities, gross negligence and maladministration, and recommending that Magashule institute disciplinary action against implicated officials. The Public Protector did not investigate alleged links between the project and the Gupta family, claiming financial and resource constraints, resulting in Mkhwebane being summoned to appear before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services to explain these comments. The report was criticised by the opposition Democratic Alliance as a whitewash of corruption, and by the South African Federation of Trade Unions for exonerating the main political figures responsible for the scandal (Magashule, Mosebenzi Zwane and the Guptas), while making a scapegoat of minor players. The Democratic Alliance and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) successfully applied to have Mkhwebane's report on the project declared unconstitutional and set aside, with the Gauteng High Court finding that the Public Protector had failed in her duties to investigate the Vrede Dairy Project. The Public Protector's office was ordered to pay the costs of the challenge, with some of the costs awarded against Mkhwebane personally. Mkhwebane's impartiality was called into question in 2020 after Mosebenzi Zwane, who was under investigation by The Public Protector's office at the time, attended Mkhwebane's 50th birthday party with fellow corruption-accused Bongani Bongo.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1919 to 1939. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2017.  History  Ascot State School (established 1920) is located in the Brisbane suburb of Ascot, six kilometres northeast of the Brisbane CBD. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. It retains three urban brick school buildings (Block A: 1920, Block B: 1928-34, Block C: 1923-39), which incorporate rare educational murals in Block B. It is set in landscaped grounds with a playing field, sporting facilities and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with the Ascot community. Traditionally the land of the Turrbal and Jagera people, land at Ascot was sold as country lots in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and underwent subdivision from the 1880s after the Doomben railway line to the Eagle Farm Racecourse opened in 1882. However, most housing development occurred after the turn of the century, stimulated by the opening of the electrified tram to the racecourse, along the current Kingsford Smith Drive and Racecourse Road, in 1899.Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Cultural Heritage Database and Register, , accessed 8 Feb 2017'Land Sales', The Courier, 13 Sep 1861, p.4DNRM, Survey Plan RP34480, 1863'Local and Domestic', The North Australian, Ipswich and General Advertiser, 27 Apr 1858, p.3McKellar map of Brisbane, 1896, sheets 2 & 3Queensland Places - Ascot, , accessed 27 Sep 2016BCC, Brisbane Heritage Trails: Gallivant Through Ascot and Hamilton, BCC, Brisbane, 2014, pp. 4-5State Library of Queensland (SLQ), Tattersall's Estate map, 1899SLQ, Ascot Railway Estate, 1913. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of new communities and integral to their success. Schools became a community focus, with the school community contributing to maintenance and development; a symbol of progress; and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. Dramatic reform of the Queensland Education system began around 1909 and continued until the beginning of World War I. During this period a high school system was introduced, technical education was expanded, the University of Queensland was inaugurated, a teachers' training college was established, the requirement for a local contribution of construction costs for new schools was abolished, and the leaving age was increased from 12 to 14 years.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 28. Although technically compulsory since 1875, school attendance was not enforced until 1900. Subsequently, student numbers rose across Queensland during the first 15 years of the 20th century.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.18. Actions to establish a state school in Ascot commenced in 1914. The current site, bounded by Pringle, Anthony and Mayfield (now Massey) Streets, was purchased for a future school in May 1914 at a cost of ¬£1400.DNRM, Certificate of Title (CoT) 218455, being resubdivisions 75-91 and 89-103, comprising 3 acres 2 roods 6 2/10 perchesN Guy and Harold Sutcliffe, Ascot: A different school, Boolarong Press, Brisbane, 1995, p. 1G.

In December 1915 a public meeting, held to organise a state school at Ascot, established the prerequisite school building committee for that purpose. However, due to World War I, there were insufficient funds to institute the school.'School wanted at Ascot', Daily Standard, 23 Dec 1915, p. 7Noela Guy and Harold Sutcliffe, Ascot: a different school, Boolarong Press, Brisbane, 1995, pp. 1, 3. Approval for the school, comprising an urban brick school building, was given on 13 June 1919.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 3: QSA, Item ID13693, School Files (correspondence for State School, Ascot, No 296), Preliminary Estimate of Modified Plan', Thomas Pye, Deputy Govt Architect, 9 May 1919. Brick school buildings were far less frequently built than timber ones, only being provided in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly-increasing populations. All brick school buildings were individually designed with variations in style, size, and form, but generally retained similar classroom sizes, layouts and window arrangements to timber schools to facilitate natural light and ventilation. However, compared to contemporary standard education buildings, these buildings had a grander character and greater landmark attributes.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.18, 99QSA, Item ID13693, School Files (correspondence for State School, Ascot, No 296), Preliminary Estimate of Modified Plan', Thomas Pye, Deputy Govt Architect, 9 May 1919. Ascot State School opened on 24 May 1920 with 124 pupils enrolled. Its urban brick school building (now called Block A) was an \\"attractive building of brick, rough- casted externally, plastered internally, ceiled with fibro-cement and roofed with tiles\\".DPW, Annual Report of the DPW for 1919-20, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1920, p. 4. Highset, it comprised three classrooms, verandah and attached teachers room. Each classroom featured a bank of windows, which allowed natural light to enter from the left side of the students, and had battened ceilings with a central ceiling vent. A photograph from 1920 shows casement windows, with fanlights, sheltered below window hoods and a tiled, gable roof with a central ventilation roof fleche. Verandah corners were enclosed with dark-coloured weatherboards, centred four-pane windows, and light-coloured, vertically-battened timber balustrades and trim. Costing ¬£3,556, the school building was designed to accommodate 120 pupils.Department of Public Works (DPW) drawing, 16192660, July 1919Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 8Project Services, Ascot State School' in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp. 1, 5, end pages. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Aesthetically- designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.4, 48-9. From Ascot State School's inception, there was an emphasis on creating a beautiful environment for the pupils, with the result that the school's gardens were admired by locals and visitors.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 241-3. However, Arbor Day was not observed during the first head teacher's administration (Thomas Henderson, 1920‚Äì39) because \\"every Thursday the children [were]...given a practical lesson on the planting and culture of various plants and shrubs\\".Thomas Henderson, 1934 cited by Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 243. During Ascot State School's first year, its school committee made enormous improvements to the school grounds. They established gardens, spray lines to water them, an impressive array of playground equipment on a terraced playground, a tennis court (located northeast of the school building on the Pringle Street side) and a swimming pool located to the southeast of the school building and fronting Massey Street. The school's tree-planting programme \\"strictly followed [a] plan, which allowed for only colourful flowering trees to be planted around the school ground's perimeter i.e poinciana, jacaranda, silky oak and...South African red tulip tree[s]\\".Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 9. However, the school's small oval was a rough, at times boggy, site that took years to improve.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 9, 14'Beautify the City', Daily Standard, 23 May 1921, p. 5. In the same year, enrolments at Ascot State School outstripped accommodation as subdivision and residential building in Ascot boosted its population. By April 1921, less than a year after opening, the school population was 310.SLQ, Winstanes Junction Estate map, >1918SLQ, Jolimont Estate map, 1938Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp, 8, 13. Money was allocated by the government for an additional wing in October 1922. This northern wing (now called Block C) was completed in the following year and officially opened on 20 October 1923. It ran perpendicular to the school's first building, faced Pringle Street and was connected to the original building by a verandah. Similar in design and materials to the first building, it was brick with rough-cast external render. It provided three new classrooms and a teachers room, while the undercroft was divided into play space and a gymnasium.DPW, Annual Report of the DPW to 30 June 1924, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p. 4Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 14. Enrolments continued to grow as Ascot's population increased. In 1927 there were 568 pupils at the school and four classes were taught permanently in the undercroft. In response, the Department of Public Works (DPW) drew plans in 1927 for a new, southern block (Block B), which would form a U-shaped complex plan.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 28DPW, Drawing 16192616, 15 Dec 1927. On 25 August 1928, Block B was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, Thomas Wilson. Built of rough-cast render and brick, it provided four extra classrooms on the upper floor level of the existing school and one underneath, each of which was . The whole provided extra seating accommodation for 200 pupils. Folding partitions on the upper floor converted the classrooms into one assembly room. The undercroft was concreted. A photograph from 1928 shows the building had tiled window hoods, and banks of casement windows and centre- pivoting sashes with awning fanlights.DPW drawing 16192627, 31 May 1932'Ascot State School', Daily Standard, 28 Aug 1928, p. 5DPW, Annual Report of the DPW to 30 June 1928, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p. 7Project Services, Ascot SS, p. 6. Commencement of the Great Depression in 1929 halted fulfilment of further accommodation requests for the next three years at Ascot State School.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 29. The Great Depression caused a dramatic reduction in public building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. The Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power in June 1932 after a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. It embarked on a large public building programme designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building programme included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; hospitals and asylums; courthouses, police stations and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p.8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p.7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp.6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p.2. Extension of Block C was approved and commenced in September 1932. Comprising two classrooms of with wide verandahs and a hat room on two levels, plus lavatory facilities underneath, it accommodated a further 80 pupils and cost ¬£1033. The design and materials matched existing work. In the same year, lavatories were also constructed under Block B, and a dressing shed added to the swimming pool.DPW drawings, 16192627, 1932 and 16192605, 12 May 1932QSA, Item ID13695, School Files (correspondence) for State Schools, Ascot No 296 State School, DPW Work Order, Job 26717, 15 Sep 1932Project Services, Ascot SS, p. 9. Immediately after the completion of the addition to Block C, more classrooms were required for the 707 pupils enrolled at June 1933, as the school's 13 classrooms accommodated only 520 pupils. Plans for a major extension to Block B, which would complete that building for approximately ¬£3,388, were approved in December 1933 and construction began early in 1934. The DPW's Annual Report described it as a three-storied addition with separate entrances to each floor. The middle floor contained a single classroom designed as a one-teacher school with a gallery for 36 trainees and a wide verandah. The top floor contained two classrooms, stairs, verandah, hat room and cloakroom. Folding partitions separated these and the existing classrooms. The floor of one of the new classrooms was raised above the level of the floor of the existing classroom, which enabled it to be used as a stage. The new classroom, together with the four existing rooms, formed a large assembly hall when the folding partitions were opened. The cloakroom served as a dressing room behind the stage.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 29DPW, Annual Report for the Year ending 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p. 7DPW drawing 16192583, 13 Dec 1933 DPW, Annual Report for the Year ending 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p. 12. In 1935, less than a year after the completion of the Block B addition, the head teacher requested more accommodation. The disparity between the number of pupils and classrooms worsened, as work on addition did not commence until after May 1939, by which time the school population had risen to 822. With an authorised cost of ¬£4,387, these additions to Block C completed the symmetrical layout of the school buildings. Constructed of brick and concrete with a Marseilles tile roof, the design utilised the fall of the land on the site to provide sub- basement, basement and ground floors. Accommodation comprised four classrooms, teachers room, cloak rooms, seating area and store, together with a concrete staircase at the eastern end of the wing and verandahs to the north. Each classroom had folding partitions to create a single room of approximately . The extension accommodated 160 pupils.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 32-3DPW plan 16192528, 16192385, 16192528, 16192539 & 16192550, 12 May 1939DPW, Annual Report of the DPW for the year ending 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p.12. Changes to the grounds took place in conjunction with this addition. Concrete pathways were laid to all sides of the addition and concrete steps, and park rail fences were set on the banks between the terraces of the upper level. A new tennis court replaced the old one, which was encroached upon by the new extension.DPW, Annual Report of the DPW for the year ending 30 June 1939, p. 12DNRM, Aerial 1936, ADA5-5727DNRM, Aerial 1944, RAAF0-1944 Children digging air raid trenches as protection against Japanese air raids, 1942 Commencement of the War in the Pacific during World War II impacted on schools. In January 1942 due to fears of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended.Ronald Wood, Civil Defence in Queensland During World War II, Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol 15, 1993, p. 79'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p. 3. Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools. A photograph of Ascot State School in 1942 shows older male pupils digging slit trenches.SLQ Photograph 42866. Typically, schools were a focus for civilian duty during wartime. At many, students and staff members grew produce and flowers for donation to local hospitals and organised fundraising and the donation of useful items to Australian soldiers on active service.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 60-62. At Ascot State School, vegetable gardens were a special feature of the garden work performed by pupils. The produce was distributed mainly to Red Cross hostels and canteens, although later in the war it was sold for the benefit of Patriotic Funds.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 243. After World War II, Ascot's population continued to rise, as did that of the school, which peaked at 1433 in 1959.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 36. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and to cope many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp. 28-31. A number of new buildings were added at Ascot State School between 1950 and 1960. Most have been replaced.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 36, 38-9DNRM, Aerial 23 Aug 1951, BCC4-3298DPW, Annual Report of the DPW for the year ending 30 June 1957, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p. 17. Along with the expansion of the school's buildings came improvement and expansion of the school's grounds. In 1955, extensive drainage and earthworks and development of the oval were planned. The Minister for Public Instruction requested that the Brisbane City Council (BCC) transfer its park land to the east of the school to the Department of Public Instruction. The BCC agreed to vest the land in the Secretary of Public Instruction as trustee in perpetuity, provided an undertaking was given \\"to develop, maintain and use the area during normal school hours as playground for the school children, free of buildings and fencing and allow the use of the area by the general public during other than school hours\\".Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p.104. The transfer took place in June 1956 and on 10 August 1956 the completed, upgraded Meibush Oval, named after a former school principal, was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, Jack Pizzey. The total cost of the project was ¬£4087 including a government subsidy of ¬£1577.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 24-5. Further renovations of the oval were required in 1963 when, amongst other improvements, concrete stairs were built on the Massey Street side.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, p. 26. With the transfer of Grade 8 education to secondary schools from January 1964, the pressure on classroom accommodation was largely resolved. However, further additions to the site and improvements to facilities and accommodation occurred in the ensuing decades. During the 1970s and 1980s a number of new buildings were constructed.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 39,43, 67DPW Drawings 11332508, May 197311332530, 197616192440, 197511151701, 11151712, 11151756 &11658339, 198413061829, Architectural Record - Site Plan, 1976, 1996DPW drawing 13061829, Architectural Record - Site Plan, 1976, 1996. Early buildings were also altered over time. In 1970 extensions and alterations to the Block A teachers room took place. In 1977 the verandah of Block B was enclosed. In 1979 alterations to Blocks A, B and C were approved, as were plans for enclosure of Block C's verandah. In 1980, provision was made for the janitor and cleaners in Block B, and all toilet blocks were remodelled and upgraded. The roofs of Blocks A, B and C were re-tiled in mid-1982. At the turn of the 21st century, as part of the Building Better Schools Program, classrooms in Block C were upgraded.DPW Plans: 11334862, May 1979Plan 11333993, 197917664570, 2000DPW drawing 21258721 & 21258732, Apr 2000Project Services, Ascot SS, p. 9Guy & Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 39, 41Project Services drawing 17664581, 2001. The school's grounds also underwent significant improvements. In 1966 a larger pool replaced the earlier one. In the 1980s, landscaping of the areas between Blocks A, B and C, and the rejuvenation and extension of the adventure playground took place. In 2000, the tennis court between Blocks D and G was converted into a covered area and a new canteen added to the east of Block D.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 41, 177Project Services, drawing 20296/13891/PC/A01. Community involvement in the school has been significant since the school's opening. In the early years the parents established gardens, built playground equipment, and constructed a tennis court and swimming pool. Creating a usable oval occupied the school committee's attention for many years. For about 10 years from , the Ascot Show Society held its annual show in the Ascot State School grounds. Fancy dress balls were also held at the school in the 1930s. From the 1960s, through until at least the late 1970s, fundraising through walkathons was popular.Guy and Sutcliffe, Ascot, pp. 18-26, 244-5'Ascot Show', The Daily Mail, 27 Oct 1923, p. 17'Ascot State School', Daily Standard, 9 Sep 1927, p. 9'Ascot Show', Daily Standard, 5 Sep 1930'Ascot Annual Show', Daily Standard, 14 Sep 1931, p. 2. Introduced by the first head teacher at the school, murals were painted on classroom walls for educational purposes. The earliest, painted by a commercial artist, were in place by November 1930. Others were painted by Arthur E Guymer, while working as a trainee and as a teacher at the school in the 1930s. Murals of sheep- and cattle-raising, exports, mining, sugar growing and other industries were painted on bulkheads and classroom walls throughout the school. In the infants' classroom, Brer Rabbit, Donald Duck and other characters were depicted.'City Youngsters Appreciate Wool and Primary Production, Qld Country Life, 29 Sep 1938, p. 7'Head Teachers' Social Club', Queensland Times, 4 Nov 1930, p. 4'City Youngsters Appreciate Wool and Primary Production', Queensland Country Life, 29 Sep 1938, p. 7. Murals relating to Queensland industries, transport and tourism, Australian states and New Zealand remain in some classrooms of Block B.

It retains its urban brick school buildings, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, playing areas, and mature shade trees. Ascot State School is important to Ascot as a key social focus for the community, as generations of students have been taught there and many social events held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment.  Description  Site plan, 2017 Ascot State School occupies a , sloping site within the residential suburb of Ascot, approximately northeast of the Brisbane CBD. The rectangular site faces and is primarily accessed from Pringle Street to the north; and is bounded on other sides by Anthony Street to the west, Massey Street to the south and residential properties to the east. The school buildings are located on the elevated, western end of the school grounds, and a large playing field occupies the lower, eastern portion of the site. Fronting Pringle, Anthony and Massey streets, three connected urban brick school buildings (blocks A, B and C) are set in a U-shape configuration and are the earliest and westernmost of the school buildings. The school grounds contain a number of significant mature trees and landscaping features, including a courtyard (between blocks A, B and C), mature trees and a playing field. Block B contains rare educational murals on its classroom walls. = Urban brick school buildings (blocks A, B and C) = The three urban brick school buildings (blocks A, B and C) are individually designed, masonry and timber structures, which have terracotta-tiled gable and Dutch-gable roofs. The gable ends and gablets have decorative timbering set in front of circular roof vents; and prominent fleches protrude above the roofs. The three buildings are symmetrically arranged in a U-shaped plan, with Block A located centrally to the west (running north-south); Block B to the south (running east-west); and Block C to the north (running east-west). The buildings range from a single storey with an undercroft (open space) at the west to two storeys at the east, reflecting the slope of the site. Block A has a single storey, which is lowset at the west; and the ground underneath has been cut to form an understorey (enclosed space). The first floor of blocks B and C are aligned with Block A. Blocks B and C both have open undercroft spaces at the west and understorey spaces at the east. The first floor of the buildings generally have rough-cast finished masonry walls with red face brick dressings, and red face brick walls to the undercroft and understorey level. The first floors of the blocks are connected by a continuous verandah which runs to the north of Block C, east of Block A and south of Block B. Various stairs provide access to the verandah; with two enclosed by face brick walls and forming the eastern ends of blocks B and C. The verandahs on each level provide access to the interior spaces. The first floor verandahs have raked ceilings lined in timber v-jointed (VJ) boards, timber floors, square timber posts, timber post-and-rail balustrades, and brick verandah walls (some have been painted). Some sections of single- skin, weatherboard-clad timber walls (former hat racks) are retained; and teachers annexes are connected to the verandahs of Block A and Block C. Block B's verandah features a scalloped valance, eaves with exposed rafters, and timber-framed, wired-glass partitions at the eastern and western ends. Verandahs to the understorey level have flat ceilings lined with profiled and corrugated metal sheets, concrete slab floors, face brick columns and face brick verandah walls. Bag racks and modern louvre windows that enclose the verandahs are recent additions and are not of cultural heritage significance. The interior spaces of the three blocks are linearly arranged, with almost all classrooms and offices leading off verandah spaces. On the first floor, Block A contains three classrooms of a similar size; Block B has six classrooms; and Block C has four classrooms, with two withdrawal rooms separating the outermost classrooms from innermost classrooms. Blocks B and C are each terminated at the eastern end by a store and staircase. The classroom spaces generally have plastered walls, timber picture rails, and plastered ceilings with painted timber battens, and ceiling vents. Most partition walls between classrooms have been partially removed, with remaining early sections featuring VJ timber board linings. Skirtings are of concrete and timber picture rails are featured in most rooms. Block A's teachers annexe comprises three small offices / store rooms (the outer two are of a lighter construction). Block C's teachers room comprises a singular space, which has recently been divided by lightweight partitions to form toilet cubicles. The teachers rooms have plaster walls with VJ timber-lined ceilings; with the exception of the outer two rooms to Block A's teachers annexe, which have flat sheet-lined walls and ceilings. The lower level of blocks A, B and C comprises an undercroft at the west, and understorey at the east. Block A is mostly open play space, with an early enclosure at the northwestern end, and enclosed store rooms beneath the teachers rooms. The western ends of blocks B and C are mainly open play space with early toilet / amenities enclosures. The eastern end of Block C has three classrooms, with the two easternmost divided by a folding partition (now removed), and terminated by an eastern staircase with store located under the stairs. Block B features two classrooms, with the easternmost being of a double classroom width, and eastern stair with store room under. The floor level of the easternmost classroom is tiered at the western end (former seating platforms relating to the use of the room as a One Teacher School). The classroom spaces generally have plastered walls, plastered ceilings with painted timber battens and concrete skirtings. All undercroft spaces feature face brick columns, which are rounded below head height. Rare surviving early educational murals of painted text and images, on topics such as tourism, transport, farming, sugar cane, and Australian states, are painted directly onto the bulkheads and walls of classrooms in Block B. Most feature a detailed image with adjacent wording. Murals to the understorey classroom of Block B have been covered, although it is likely that these survive underneath the recent paint. Most early timber joinery within the building has been retained, including: double-hung sash windows with awning fanlights to verandahs; casements and centre-pivoting windows with awning fanlights (some angled) to exterior walls; fixed louvres to the understorey level; dual timber panelled doors with stop-chamfered detailing and centre-pivoting fanlights; tall, centre-pivoting fanlights over verandah doors, and panelled, folding timber door partitions between some classrooms in Block B. Most windows feature horizontal painted concrete sills and lintels. Timber-framed, terracotta-tiled hoods shelter windows on the northern sides of all blocks, and on the western side of Block A. = Landscape Features = The school grounds are well established and comprise various mature trees, hard- scaping and courtyard spaces. Retaining walls and stairs terrace the site, down to a playing field at the east. Recent buildings are generally visually unified with the older school buildings through the use of red brickwork and tiled roofs. A set of concrete stairs (1963) on the southern side of the playing field and a smaller set south of Block B, to the west of the swimming pool, provide access to the site from Massey Street. A courtyard located between blocks A, B and C incorporates a covered play space, a modern sculpture garden and various mosaic artworks, none of which are of cultural heritage significance. A linear, paved and concreted space continues from the courtyard down to the playing field; and facilitates a visual axis across the length of the school site. Tall palm trees in the courtyard area are planted in rows, in line with the visual axis. Mature trees including Poincianas (Delonix regia), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), ironbarks (Eucalyptus sp.), tulipwoods (Harpullia pendula) and Jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia) are concentrated along the northern and eastern boundaries of the playing field. A mature mango tree (Mangifera sp.) is located at the northeastern end of the playing field. Prominent views of the urban brick school buildings are available from Anthony and Pringle streets over open play spaces.  Heritage listing  Ascot State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Ascot State School (established in 1920) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of standard government- designed school buildings, which were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities and mature trees. Three urban brick school buildings (1920, 1923‚Äì39, 1928‚Äì34) represent the culmination of years of experimentation with natural light, classroom size and elevation by the Department of Public Works (DPW), and also demonstrate the growing preference in the early 20th century for constructing brick school buildings at metropolitan schools in developing suburbs. Additions to Blocks B and C undertaken during the 1930s are the result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s, which stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The suburban site with mature trees, sporting facilities and other landscaping features demonstrates educational policies that promoted the importance of play and a beautiful environment in the education of children. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The 1930s educational murals, painted on the interior classroom walls of Block B are, and have always been, a rare educational practice. Intact and distinctive, they are the only known murals of this kind in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Ascot State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school with later modifications. These include: teaching buildings constructed to individual designs; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The urban brick school buildings are intact, excellent examples of individually designed urban brick school buildings. They demonstrate the principal characteristics of this type through their highset form; linear layout, with classrooms and teachers rooms accessed by verandahs; undercrofts used as open play spaces and understoreys for additional classrooms; loadbearing, masonry construction, with face brick piers to undercroft spaces; and roof fleches. They demonstrate use of the stylistic features of their era, which determined their roof form, decorative treatment and joinery. Typically, urban brick school buildings are configured to create central courtyards, and are located in suburban areas that were growing at the time of their construction. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The urban brick school buildings at Ascot State School have aesthetic significance due to their beautiful attributes: identifiable by their symmetrical layout; consistent form; scale; materials; elegant composition; finely crafted timber work; and decorative treatment. These buildings remain intact and demonstrate a continuation of site planning ideals initiated by the placing of the original urban brick school building in a prominent position at the top of the sloping site. The beauty of the school's setting is enhanced by mature trees and formal landscaping elements such as retaining walls and stairs. The buildings are also significant for their contribution to the Anthony and Pringle Streets' streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Ascot State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It developed from 1920 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Ascot children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its suburban district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

It also occurs with McKusick‚ÄìKaufman syndrome (MKS). Polydactyly and heart disease are associated with this condition. Diagnosis is challenging because symptoms also occur in a variety of other syndromes. Secretions can build up and extend as far as the uterus and abdomen. Mucometrocolpos can sometimes cause abdominal distention. The build up of mucous secretions can occur prior to adolescence unrelated to menstruation. Many cases can be detected prenatally. Treatment is surgical and is specific for each case. After treatment, many females are still able to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term.

A smaller engine displacement version complies with the Superbike category competition regulations which state \\"Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc\\" for three and four cylinder 4-stroke engines.2019 FIM Superbike regulations (updated version 8 May 2019) FIM-live, 8 May 2019. Retrieved 16 May 2019 The name \\"Panigale\\" comes from the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The Panigale V4 uses the new Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, derived from the Desmosedici MotoGP racing engine.  Development  The Panigale V4 is Ducati's first large-production street bike with a V4 engine, Ducati having primarily used V-twins since the 1960s, except on prototypes and racing motorcycles. They had sold a short run of 1,500 street-legal V4 Desmosedici RRs in 2007 and 2008 and made two prototypes of the Apollo V4 in 1964. The initial development of the Panigale V4 started with the 2015 MotoGP racing engine. Ducati said the Panigale V4 was designed to combine racing features, while also being an entertaining and rideable motorcycle with a durable engine. This created the challenge of designing an engine that could keep the MotoGP engine's counter- rotating crankshaft, and large bore diameter, but have the service intervals expected on consumer motorcycles. Originally, Ducati was initially keeping the MotoGP bike's chassis, but later changed to a completely new front frame they said has less weight and more stability.  Design  Cycle World said in spite of being a V4, the new Panigale is only slightly wider than the V-twin 1299. Ducati claimed weight is heavier than the 1299, with foot pegs higher. Unlike the prior 1199 and 1299 where the engine is the primary element of the frame, the engine is surrounded by a more conventional aluminum perimeter frame. The Panigale V4's electronics include a wheelie control system derived from the 1299 Superleggera, along with traction and drift control. The brakes have a new ABS designed for high speed cornering. Ducati and Brembo designed -lighter brake calipers than the 1299's. The bike's tires, the Diablo Super Corsa SP developed by Ducati and Pirelli, have a new rear compound. = Engine = The Panigale V4's desmodromic 90¬∞ V4 engine, unlike the prior 1199 and 1299 where the engine is the primary element of the frame, is surrounded by a more conventional aluminum perimeter frame. The engine is rotated further backwards than other Ducatis, so that the swingarm pivot is mated to the rear cylinders, rather than lower on the engine near the crankshaft. Unlike most street bikes and previous Ducatis other than MotoGP racing machines, the Panigale V4's engine rotates in the opposite direction of the wheels, counteracting the gyroscopic effect and therefore decreasing the force necessary to change the bike's inclination.  Variants = Panigale V4 S = The Panigale V4 S is a more performance-oriented version of the base V4. It has an √ñhlins suspension that the rider can electronically adjust, or set to the sport, race, or street modes typical of contemporary performance bikes. It also has a lightweight lithium battery, and forged aluminium wheels, reducing the bike's overall weight. = Panigale V4 Speciale = The Panigale V4 Speciale has the S model options, and adds adjustable footpads, an Alcantara-trimmed seat, a top triple clamp, carbon mudguards, a data analyzer system, and race fuel cap. It also has a titanium exhaust and race kit that Ducati claims increases the power from a claimed . = Panigale V4 R = The Panigale V4 R is a WSBK homologation special of the standard V4. Compared to the standard engine of the Panigale V4/V4 S, the V4 R uses a variant to comply with WSBK rules. This engine makes a claimed at 15,250 rpm and of torque at 11,500 rpm with the race kit optional package. This makes the V4 R the most powerful street-legal production bike available in the world, meaning that, with a dry weight of 165 kg, reaches an astonishing power-to-weight ratio of 1.41. The frame has been reworked and the swingarm pivot can be adjusted. The fairing has been widened by as part of the aerodynamic styling. According to the Ducati CEO Claudio Domenicali, the winglets applied to the V4 R fairing are almost identical to the GP16 MotoGP bike. The suspension uses fully adjustable titanium nitrided NPX front forks by √ñhlins, and the rear a fully adjustable √ñhlins TTX36 monoshock.https://paultan.org/2018/11/05/2019-ducati- panigale-v4-r-released-now-with-wings-rest-of-ducati-panigale-superbike-range- gets-updates/http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/eicma-2018-ducati- panigale-v4r-unveiled-weighs-165kg-makes-234ps/  References  External links  * Sport bikes Panigale V4 Motorcycles introduced in 2018 Motorcycles powered by V engines ","title":"Ducati Panigale V4"},{"id":"56434495","text":"Yogesh Chander Modi (Y.C.

It is the second adaptation of the 1983 novel of the same name by Stephen King, after the 1989 film. The film stars Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, and John Lithgow, and follows a family that discovers a mysterious graveyard in the woods behind their new home. Talks for a new adaptation of Pet Sematary began in March 2010, with Greenberg initially writing the screenplay. Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Steven Schneider were revealed to be producing the remake with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo in talks to direct it. By December 2017, Paramount Pictures had greenlit this new film version of King's novel, with duo filmmakers K√∂lsch and Widmyer directing. Principal photography commenced on June 18, 2018, in Montreal and Hudson, Quebec, Canada, and wrapped on August 11, 2018. Pet Sematary premiered at South by Southwest festival on March 16, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 5, 2019, by Paramount Pictures. The film had grossed over $113 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the dark tone, atmosphere and performances, but disliked the slow pacing and reliance on jump scares. Critics and audiences were both divided on the changes between the film and book, though many named it better than the 1989 adaptation. Plot Louis Creed, an emergency physician from Boston, Massachusetts, moves to the small town of Ludlow, Maine with his wife, Rachel, their two young children, Ellie and Gage, and Ellie's cat, Church. Exploring the woods, Rachel and Ellie stumble across a funeral procession of children taking a dead dog to a cemetery called \\"Pet Sematary.\\" At the university hospital, Louis is left shaken after failing to save the life of Victor Pascow, a student who was fatally injured after being struck and dragged by a vehicle. He later experiences a vivid dream in which Victor leads him to the deadfall at the back of the cemetery and warns him not to \\"venture beyond.\\" Louis awakens to find his feet and sheets caked in mud, suggesting that the events were more than just a nightmare. On Halloween, Church is killed by a truck. Jud Crandall, their neighbor who has a soft spot for Ellie, takes Louis past the pet cemetery to an ancient burial ground to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home alive, though he is different: aggressive and violent, tearing apart a bird and eating it alive. Jud reveals to Louis that the burial ground brings things back from the dead and is believed to be inhabited by a spirit known as the Wendigo. He apologizes, having thought Church would return the same. After Church attacks Gage, Louis unsuccessfully attempts to euthanize him and instead decides to set him free in the wild. During her birthday party, Ellie spots Church on the road and excitedly rushes to him, but is hit and killed by a derailed tanker truck. The family is devastated, and Rachel and Gage leave to spend a few days with Rachel's parents. Sensing that Louis is planning on resurrecting Ellie, Jud warns the grieving father that \\"sometimes dead is better.\\" Though Victor's spirit similarly warns him, Louis's grief spurs him to carry out his plan. He drugs Jud, exhumes Ellie's corpse, and reburies her in the animal graveyard as the Wendigo looks on. Ellie rises from the dead but manifests a disturbing demeanor. Meanwhile, Rachel is frightened by visions of her dead sister Zelda, who suffered from spinal meningitis and died after falling down a dumbwaiter shaft. Gage is also frightened by the ghost of Victor who tries to warn him about going home. Jud wakes up and spots Ellie in the house. He flees home in horror to retrieve his revolver, but Jud, distracted by a growling Church, allows Ellie to surprise him on the stairwell‚Äîslicing through Jud's Achilles tendon with a scalpel and taunting him with the voice of his dead wife before viciously stabbing him to death. Rachel and Gage return home and encounter the undead Ellie. Rachel is horrified and flees with Gage to an upstairs bedroom. Ellie, enraged at being rejected by her mother, attacks Rachel as Louis finds Jud's blood-soaked body. Rushing home, Louis manages to save Gage just as Ellie fatally stabs Rachel. He locks Gage in the car, and Rachel begs her husband not to bury her in the pet cemetery. Ellie knocks Louis unconscious and drags her mother's body to the burial ground. At the pet cemetery, Ellie tries to kill Louis. As Louis prepares to decapitate his daughter, he is impaled by a weather vane by a reanimated Rachel and is subsequently buried as she was. Along with Church, the undead trio set fire to Jud's house before approaching the car. The resurrected Louis peers into the car at Gage before a beeping sound of unlocking is heard and the screen cuts to black. In an alternate ending released on home media, Louis spares Ellie instead of killing her, and they both bury Rachel behind the pet cemetery, promising that they will be a family together forever. After burning Jud's house, Louis and Ellie approach the family car, where Gage is still locked in. In the house, Ellie, Church, and a newly resurrected Rachel approach and reunite with an unhappy Louis holding Gage, who is crying.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and built from 1920 to 1933. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2015.  History  Virginia State School opened in 1920 in the northern Brisbane suburb of Virginia to serve the growing population in the area. Due to suburban development during the interwar period and after World War II, extensions were made and buildings added to the site to serve the school's growing pupil numbers. Virginia State School has a highly intact three-wing sectional school building (Blocks B, C and D) that was constructed in five stages between 1920 and 1933, and is set in landscaped grounds with mature shade trees, forestry plots and sporting facilities. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activities. The provision of state- administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. After the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Thom Blake and Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013), p.2Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p.2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.84, 120-1. Originally the land of the Turrbul people, the land in the vicinity of the later Virginia State School was surveyed in 1864 and country portions sold by 1878. The area became known as \\"Virginia\\" after the opening of the Virginia railway station on the North Coast railway line in 1888. The railway made the area more accessible and stimulated growth. The Virginia Brick Company was established nearby about 1892. Between the 1890s and 1910s a small village formed around the railway station and by 1911 the area's population was 167.Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM), Plan S3135 \\"Plan of 59 Portions, Parish Kedron, County Stanley\\" and Plan 3134'Virginia', , accessed 29 Oct 20141911 census cited by \\"Virginia\\", , accessed 29 Oct 2014. The community petitioned the Department of Public Instruction in 1909-10 for the opening of a state school at Virginia and by 1915 a plan of the area showed a school reserve on the site of a former recreation reserve. In 1918 the Minister for Public Instruction advised that the new school at Virginia would proceed and that its estimated cost was ¬£3000. The Queensland Government subsequently approved expenditure of ¬£1,784 on establishing the school. In January 1920 The Queenslander reported that the new state school at Virginia was nearing completion. The previously-gazetted school reserve (R1066) was increased in size to 8 acres 31.5 perches (3.37ha) through the inclusion of land to the south and west of the initial reserve, after closure of a road leading to the adjacent Virginia Brickworks.'Virginia State School', The Telegraph, 27 Nov 1918, p.7'Virginia School', The Telegraph, 30 May 1919, p.3'The New State School at Virginia', The Queenslander, 3 Jan 1920, p.28DNRM, Plan SL852, 5 May 1921. The school was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction on 31 January 1920 and teaching commenced on 2 February. It consisted of a highset, three-classroom, sectional school building running approximately east-west, with a north-facing verandah and a teachers room centrally positioned off the verandah (this building is the eastern end of the current Block B). Stairs to the east of the teachers room gave access to the verandah, and the base of the verandah wall had operable ventilation boards. The final cost according to the Department of Public Works was ¬£2276 2 shillings (s) 10 pence (p).J D Dale, Virginia SS: the first fifteen years 1920-1934, John Dale, Northgate, 1978, n.pphotograph, The Queenslander, 3 Jan 1920, p. 28'Northgate-Virginia School', The Telegraph, 28 Jan 1920, p.7DPW, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1920, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1920, p.12. Attention to improving light and ventilation to achieve an optimum classroom culminated in 1920 with the Sectional School (type DT/1), a high-set timber structure. This fundamentally new design combined all the best features of previous types and implemented theories of an ideal education environment. It proved very successful and was used unaltered until 1950. This type was practical, economical, satisfied educational requirements and climatic needs and allowed for the orderly expansion of schools over time.School types are detailed in the following study: Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study, p.30. Before the sectional school, all school buildings were generally aligned with street and property boundaries, regardless of aspect. By late 1914, after acceptance of the principles and virtues of providing natural light into classrooms advocated by Eleanor Bourne, (appointed as the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911), buildings were being preferably orientated to receive maximum indirect southern light. The sectional school type was designed to have an unobstructed wall of windows on its southern elevation and verandahs, typically to the north but sometimes to the end elevations, allowing for linkages to other and future buildings. Its blank end walls were also detailed to be removable, so that as the school grew, the building could be easily extended in sections, hence the name. This led to the construction of long narrow buildings of many classrooms - a distinctive feature of Queensland schools.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.38-40. At Virginia State School, rapid growth in student numbers over the next 12 years resulted in four additions, constructed to the west of the original sectional school building, and ultimately forming three connected wings. Pupil numbers in the first two years grew from 165 at opening to 252 by December 1921 resulting in the first enlargement of the school in 1922. Two classrooms were added to the western end of the sectional school building (the classrooms now form the western end of Block B) at a cost of ¬£1,271 9s. However, by June 1923 a deputation from Virginia State School was requesting the Minister for Public Instruction to duplicate the existing accommodation, provide a retiring room for the female teachers, and to board-in parts of the school's understorey.'Virginia SS', Brisbane Courier, 19 Dec 1921, p.9Dale, Virginia State School, n.p.DPW, Report of the Department of Public works for the Year Ended 30 June 1922, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1922, p.9'Virginia School Requirements', Brisbane Courier, 19 Jul 1923, p.10. Block C from south-west, 2015 Before any action was taken, disaster struck in January 1924 when a severe storm blew the school building off its brick piers and almost split it in half. The Department of Public Works dismantled, re-erected and enlarged the building at a cost of ¬£4110 12s 3p. The reconstructed and extended building was re- positioned away from the boundaries and did not address the street. Instead, its verandahs were oriented to the northeast. The additions consisted of a three-classroom wing (now forming the eastern end of Block C) attached via a verandah from the western side of the earlier wing, and linked to the northeastern verandah of the new wing. A second teachers room was also added to the 1922 classroom wing and a stairway added beside it. The verandah corners were enclosed to form hat rooms.'Virginia School Damaged', Brisbane Courier, 28 Jan 1924, p.5'Virginia School' The Telegraph, 30 Jan 1924, p.3'Education Department's Smart Work', The Telegraph, 6 Feb 1924, p. 10'Virginia School Fete', Brisbane Courier, 20 Apr 1925, p.15DPW, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1924, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1924, p.15Project Services, \\"Virginia SS\\" in Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, p.7 The student population at Virginia State School continued to grow and further additions were made to the school. In May 1926 the School Committee approached the Department of Public Instruction for increased accommodation, but additions to the school were not approved until August 1927. By then the school's enrolment figure was 530 and there was only accommodation for 320 pupils. In the meantime children were taught on the verandahs and under the school building. The then western wing (current Block C) was extended by three classrooms and an additional staircase in 1927-28. The new classrooms were separated by timber partitions.'Virginia State School', Brisbane Courier, 13 May 1926, p.13'Insufficient Room', Brisbane Courier, 16 Feb 1927, p.24'School conditions', The Telegraph, 16 Sep 1926 p.12Project Services, \\"Virginia State School\\", n.p.Dale, Virginia State School, n.pePlan, DPW Drawing 16022094, \\"Virginia SS, additions alterations etc\\", 1926. Block D, teachers rooms, from north-west, 2015 The most westerly wing (current Block D) was added in 1933 at a cost of ¬£1781 10s 8p, and opened on 1 July 1933 by Frank Cooper, the Minister for Public Instruction. This wing was connected by verandah to the northwestern end of the 1927-28 additions, making the building more symmetrical. Erected on high concrete piers, the area underneath was concreted. This wing (a Sectional School) comprised four classrooms, each ; two teachers rooms off its northern verandah, both ; and a staircase near the northwestern corner. The classrooms were lined with tongue and groove timber boarding, and were divided by fixed timber partitions with central connecting double doors. Their ceilings were coved, with metal tie rods and latticed ceiling vents. This wing provided additional accommodation for 160 pupils, which, together with the existing classrooms, accommodated a total of 560 pupils. Provision was made for an additional room for 40 pupils, which would have made the building symmetrical; but this was never built.'New Wing Opened Virginia SS', Sunday Mail, 2 Jul 1933, p.13ePlan, DPW Drawing 16022105, \\"Virginia SS additions\\", 1932Project Services, \\"Virginia State School\\" 2008, p.6'Department of Public Works Heavy Building Programme Details from the Annual Report', The Telegraph, 4 Oct 1928, p.6'School Buildings', Brisbane Courier, 24 Feb 1933, p.14DPW, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1933, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1933, p.11. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Boyd was critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations stressed the importance of the adding shade trees to playgrounds. Subsequently, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline and developed aesthetic tastes.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. From the 1920s, the Virginia State School community implemented plans to improve the school's grounds. Arbor Day plantings were undertaken in the 1920s and trees were planted on the Sandgate Road boundary at that time. In April 1925 a tennis court, located in the southwestern corner of the grounds was completed. In the following year, further work on the tennis court and grounds was undertaken by community members during a working bee. In 1926, the school committee supplied trees for Arbor Day planting and decided to approach the Department of Public Instruction for materials to construct seats under those shade trees large enough to warrant seats. In the next year, the school committee instituted a grounds improvement fund to finance improvements, while in May 1930, it decided to repair the tennis court and proceed with other improvements to the grounds. Subsequently, the committee held a balloon carnival in October 1930 to raise funds to improve and beautify the school grounds. Drainage work to the \\"cricket pitch area\\" was also undertaken in 1930.'Virginia SS', Brisbane Courier, 13 May 1926, p.13'Virginia SS', Brisbane Courier, 12 June 1926, p.8'Virginia SS', Brisbane Courier, 15 Jul 1926, p.8'Virginia State School', Brisbane Courier, 20 Oct 1930, p.191946 Aerial.

After World War II, the Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp.28-31. At Virginia State School, increased student numbers resulted in a number of buildings being added to the site during the 1950s; some of which were connected to the sectional school building, resulting in modifications. Block A, containing three classrooms, was constructed as a northern extension to Block B in 1953. In July 1957, Block E was constructed as a highset, two- classroom building with an understorey play area. Its east-facing classrooms were accessed from a western verandah, which connected to Block D. Consequently, the eastern teachers room of Block D was altered, with its northeastern windows moved to the northwestern wall and new windows added to either side of the original window in the southeastern wall.DPW, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1951, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1951, p.14Project Services, \\"Virginia SS\\", p.7Project Services, \\"Virginia State School\\", p.7. ePlan, DPW Drawing 11853116, \\"Virginia SS additions\\", 1957. In 1958 alterations to Blocks B, C and D took place. After Block A burnt down in 1957, it was rebuilt in the following year as a highset building with a verandah to the west giving access to the three east facing classrooms of Block B. The eastern teachers room of Block B was rebuilt to the original dimensions with new hopper windows to the east and a double- hung sash to the west. The high-level windows in the verandah wall were removed from Blocks B and C and replaced with three double-hung sashes with fanlights. In the verandah wall of Block D, the number of windows was increased from one to three. To the three eastern classrooms of Block B, a flat suspended ceiling was installed. Glazed screens replaced a store room at the eastern end of the verandah of Block B and a storage space was added under the western teachers room.DPW, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1958, Qld Government Printer, Brisbane, 1958, p.28Project Services, \\"Virginia State School\\", p.8.ePlan, DPW Drawing 11853149, \\"Virginia SS, reinstatement of classroom wing destroyed by fire on 16.12.57\\", 1958. thumb View across the oval, 2015 After World War II, further improvements to the school grounds were undertaken. By 1958, a second tennis court had been added. Rows of pine trees to the north of the oval date from the 1950s. In 1959, the school grounds were enlarged to 12 acres 1 rood 13 perches (4.99ha) with the addition of 3 acres 6.5 perches (1.23ha) to the north and west of the school site; despite excision of land to the east to widen Sandgate Road. The school's swimming pool was built in the mid-1960s.DNRM Smartmaps, aerial, QAP733-12, 17 Apr 1958DNRM Smartmaps, Plan Sl3237 Forestry plot, 2015 As at 2015, the school grounds retain three distinct forestry plots to the north and east of the tennis courts and along the northern edge of the sports oval. Forestry plots were the product of after-school agricultural clubs, introduced in 1923 at primary schools, under the \\"home project\\" scheme. Curriculum driven, these clubs had a secondary commercial value as well as disseminating information and helping to develop a range of skills. The Department of Primary Industry provided suitable plants and offered horticultural advice. School forestry plots were seen by the government as a way of educating the next generation about the economic and environmental importance of trees, as well as providing testing grounds for new species. Located throughout the state, the plots were a means of experimenting with a variety of tree species in different soil and climatic conditions. The sale of timber grown in school plots provided an additional source of income for the school and the plots themselves were an attractive feature of school grounds. The first school forestry plot was established at Marburg State Rural School in 1928, where 275 exotic and indigenous trees were planted. Encouraged by the Education and Forestry Departments, by 1953 about 380 Queensland schools were undertaking forestry projects. A forestry plot at Virginia State School was established by 1952, at which time it included pine and cypress trees planted.State Education in Queensland 1927, p.26lnformation from Greg Logan, History Unit, Department of Education cited by Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.61The Courier Mail, 11 April 1934, p.10Queensland Times, 19 November 1949, p.5Queensland Country Life, 2 November 1950, p.4Queensland Times, 10 July 1951, p.2, Central Queensland Herald, 12 July 1951, p.16, The Courier Mail, 16 May 1953, p.3Queensland Times, 2 June 1954, p.217 Apr 1958.

It retains the Department of Public Works sectional school building set in landscaped grounds with tennis courts, sports oval, mature shade trees and forestry plots. The school is important to the area, having been a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. Since establishment, Virginia State School has been a key social focus for its community with the grounds and buildings having been the location of many social events.  Description  Site plan, 2015 Virginia State School occupies the whole of a levelled, 4.72ha block within Virginia, an industrial and residential suburb of northern Brisbane. The site is located on the corner of Sandgate Road, the major thoroughfare through Virginia, and Jefferis Street; and is bound by Brickyard Road to the southwest, parkland to the west and north, and the North Coast railway line to the northeast. The school buildings are primarily located at the southern end of the site with the earliest, a sectional school building, approximately in the centre of the group. The school complex also includes a sports oval at the northern end of the site, a tennis court (1925) in the southwestern corner, and a variety of mature trees and plantings that are mostly positioned along the site boundary, sports oval perimeter, and north and east of the tennis court. The school and its large, leafy grounds are conspicuous in their suburban setting. = 1920-1933 sectional school building (Blocks B, C and D) = Blocks B and C, 2015 The sectional school building is set well back from Jefferis street and is orientated on a southeast-northwest axis - perpendicular to Sandgate Road. It consists of three Sectional School wings (Block B, east; Block C, centre; and Block D, west) that were constructed in five stages between 1920 and 1933. The building is a highset, timber-framed and weatherboard-clad structure with corrugated metal-clad roofs, timber floors, and tall, rounded-brick (Block B and C) and concrete (Block D) stumps. The building's three wings are linked by northeast-facing verandahs which are accessed by timber stairs; and teachers rooms are attached to the verandahs of the east and west wings. The understorey is partially enclosed with a variety of brick, flat-sheet and weatherboard-clad partitions that form toilet blocks, a tuckshop, storage areas and additional classrooms - none of which are of cultural heritage significance. A range of early timber joinery is retained throughout the building including the large banks of casement windows with horizontally centre-pivoting fanlights in the southwestern walls (fanlights in the eastern block are modern); and double-hung sashes with centre-pivoting fanlights in the verandah walls (installed in the 1950s). Most doors are modern, but retain early centre-pivoting fanlights. All verandah walls are single-skin, with tongue-and-groove (T&G;), vertically-jointed (VJ) timber board linings and externally-exposed stud-framing. The verandahs have square timber posts and raked ceilings lined in T&G;, VJ boards. Bag-racks have replaced most of the timber balustrading. Early interior wall and ceiling linings are T&G;, VJ boards. Original coved ceilings survive in most classrooms; and exposed metal tie rods and square ceiling ventilation panels are retained in these spaces. Skirtings are timber and of a simple profile. The eastern and the western wings each have two teachers rooms; most of which retain their original coved ceilings and T&G;, VJ board wall and ceiling linings. Their early casement windows with centre-pivoting (eastern wing), awning and fixed (western wing) fanlights survive and some retain early window hardware. Marks within some northeastern wall linings indicate the former locations of window banks (now removed). Extensions northeast of the sectional school building, Block A and Block E, and alterations to accommodate the southeast walkway linking to Block F, are not of cultural heritage significance.  1920-2 Eastern Wing (Block B)  Block B, teachers room, 2015 The eastern wing has a gable roof with a Dutch-gable at the western end and flat-sheet eaves linings. The southeastern end-wall features a bank of high-level, centre-pivoting windows that are sheltered by a wide, corrugated metal-clad hood with decorative timber brackets. An early, low-waisted timber door provides access from the verandah to the easternmost classroom and retains some early door hardware. The lowest board of the classrooms' verandah wall is hinged at the base. The verandah has modern enclosures at either end that form additional classroom and storage spaces. Internally the wing is divided by timber partitions into three large classroom spaces (formerly five classrooms). Two original partitions at the eastern end of the wing have been removed, although their locations are identifiable through protruding marks in the flat, suspended ceiling lining. Partitions at the western end of the wing remain in their original locations, although they have been lined with flat-sheeting from floor to wall height. An opening has been cut into the westernmost partition to combine two classrooms into one large space.  1924-8 Central Wing (Block C)  Classroom in Block C with folding doors, 2015 The central wing has a gable roof with battened timber eaves linings ventilating the roof-space. Its southeastern gable-end features a bank of high-level, centre-pivoting windows; sheltered by a wide, corrugated metal-clad hood with decorative timber brackets. The verandah has been partially enclosed by modern louvres at the inner junction of the central and western wings. The interior is divided into three spaces: an eastern classroom; a western classroom; and a large, central performance space. Remnants of the original partitions survive as bulkheads in the western classroom and the central performance space, demonstrating the original six- room layout. Early, low-waisted, timber folding doors with central glass insets divide the western classroom and central performance space - the retention of these doors is rare. Aligned with a remnant partition bulkhead, east of the folding doors, are hinge marks in the wall lining that indicate the position of an additional set of folding doors (now removed).  1933 Western Wing (Block D)  Verandah, Block D, 2015 The western wing has a gable roof, with an southeastern Dutch-gable and VJ timber board eaves linings. The northwestern gable-end and the western teachers room gable-end have timber battening. The verandah retains an early hatroom enclosure at the southeastern end, with exposed timber framing and metal hooks. The northwestern end is enclosed with a weatherboard-clad, single-skin wall that houses casement windows. The interior is divided into three classroom spaces. The partitions have been moved from their original locations, although timber lattice ceiling vents and window locations in the southwestern wall are indicative of the early four-room layout. = Landscape Elements / Grounds = Camphor laurel behind pool, 2015 The grounds are well-established with many large, mature trees including figs (Ficus spp.), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), slash pines (Pinus elliottii), tipuanas (Tipuana tipu), poincianas (Delonix regia) and paper-bark tea-trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The generous sports oval north of the school building complex and its mature perimeter shade trees enhance the school's prominence in its location and provide a picturesque setting for the school. A tennis court is located in its original position in the southwestern corner of the site. Forestry plots are located along the northern edge of the sports oval (established by 1952), and north and east of the tennis court (established by 1958). In each of these locations, slash pine trees are planted in uniform rows; those east of the tennis court are bounded by timber log seating. The school grounds are beautified by mature perimeter trees, planted along the Sandgate Road and Brickyard Road boundaries. A large fig tree on the Jefferis Street boundary, east of the tennis court, is encircled by timber seating. Mature shade trees are planted in various places throughout the school site. Particularly large camphor laurel specimens are located north of Block B and north of the tennis court; and a mature Hong Kong orchid tree (Bauhina sp.) is east of the tennis court. A plaque commemorating the opening of the school is positioned north of the sectional school building.  Heritage listing  Virginia State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Virginia State School (established in 1920) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent, representative example of a standard government designed school building that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies. The sectional school building, comprising three wings (1920‚Äì33), is important in demonstrating the evolution of Department of Public Works (DPW) timber school designs to provide adequate lighting and ventilation; equally recognising educational and climatic needs. The large suburban site with mature trees, landscaping features and sporting facilities demonstrates the Queensland education system's recognition of the importance of play and aesthetics in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Virginia State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school with later modifications. This includes a highset timber-framed teaching building of a standard design that incorporates understorey play areas, verandahs, and classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation; on a generous, landscaped site with mature shade trees, play areas and sporting facilities. The sectional school building (1920‚Äì33) designed by the Department of Public Works is very intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of this type and its evolutions. Characteristics include its highset form with play space beneath, gable and Dutch-gable roofs, blank end walls, northern verandahs, large banks of south-facing windows, projecting teachers rooms, hat-room enclosures, single-skin verandah walls, early joinery, coved ceilings and early internal linings. The forestry plots at Virginia are good examples of their type, containing pine trees (Pinus spp.) planted in uniform rows. The mature camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), tipuanas (Tipuana tipu), poincianas (Delonix regia), paper-bark tea-trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia), and fig trees (Ficus spp.) are fine examples of shade trees typically planted in Queensland school grounds. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Virginia State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Virginia community.

A Canon Residentiary of St Edmundsbury Cathedral from 1993 to 2002, she became the first woman to become an Anglican Chaplain to the Queen when she was appointed in 1996. Early life and education Mingins was born on 12 July 1952 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. She studied social science and administration at the University of Birmingham, and graduated with a Bachelor of Social Science (BSocSci) in 1973. She then undertook training in social work at the University of Leicester, and she completed the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work (CQSW) in 1975. Ministry Mingins felt a call to ordination, but the ordination of women in the Church of England was years away. She instead joined the Church Army, an Anglican evangelistic organisation which accepted men and women, and attended the Church Army Training College. During her training, she completed the Cambridge Diploma in Religious Studies. She was commissioned into the Church Army in 1979, and appointed a warden of an old people's home. After four years as a warden, and having come to national attention, she was appointed a selection secretary for the Advisory Council for the Church's Ministry (ACCM) of the Church of England in 1983. She was promoted to senior selection secretary in 1984. =Ordained ministry= In 9 July 1987, with the change of the Church of England's canon law to allow the ordination of women, Mingins became one of the church's first female deacons when she was ordained by Ronald Bowlby, Bishop of Southwark, during a service at Southwark Cathedral. She continued working for the ACCM but also served as a non-stipendiary minister at All Saints Church, Battersea Park in the Diocese of Southwark from 1987 to 1988. She was then drawn to a religious life and was a Novice of the Order of the Holy Paraclete at Whitby, Yorkshire from 1989 to 1991. In 1991, Mingins left the religious community and returned to secular life. She was appointed a minor canon of St Edmundsbury Cathedral and a became an assistant diocese director of ordinands for the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. This latter appointment was highly unusual, as women had yet to been ordained as priests and she was working with both men and women who were exploring ordination. She was promoted to Diocesan Director of Ordinands (DDO) in 1992, and appointed a Canon Residentiary in 1993, thereby becoming one of the first women to become a full-member of a cathedral chapter. Mingins was ordained as a priest on 30 April 1994 by John Dennis, Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. This was the first year that women could be ordained to the priesthood. In March 1996, it was announced that she had been appointed a Chaplain to the Queen (QHC): she was the first woman appointed from the Church of England and this was seen as royal approval for the ordination of women. As a QHC, she was one of a team of 35 chaplains who took private services for the Royal Family. From 1999 to 2002, having left her previous role as DDO, she served as Canon Pastor of St Edmundsbury Cathedral. Mingins retired from full- time ministry in 2002, having been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was appointed Canon Emeritus by the cathedral and granted permission to officiate in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich so that she could continue her ministry on a part-time basis. She died on 26 June 2006, aged 53.

It was built between 1901 and 1904, while the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company was expanding its rapid transit and streetcar service. It stopped operating in 1972 and sat abandoned for more than two decades, becoming home to a community of squatters in the early 2000s. The owners, who were planning to redevelop the site, building condominiums called \\"Gowanus Village,\\" had the squatters removed and increased security in 2006. The Gowanus Village plans did not materialize and after a short time it became a popular space for graffiti and underground events. In 2012, philanthropist Joshua Rechnitz purchased the property for $7 million with plans to turn it into The Powerhouse Workshop, an arts space focused on the fabrication of artistic goods. It is managed through the nonprofit Powerhouse Environmental Arts Foundation. In 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Gowanus Batcave as an official city landmark. Early history and construction alt=Architectural diagram of the building, displaying measurements, doorways, and position of a variety of elements inside the structure. The image is taken from a book about power stations from 1910, and the bottom of the image includes the text \\"Fig. 47 - Cross Section, Central Power Station, B. R. T.\\" A Sanborn map from 1886 shows the site had been home to Nassau Sulfur Works and Smith and Shaw Mattress Materials and Paper Stock. In the late 19th century, as the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) expanded, increased demand was placed on its power supply. In the time before the Central Power Station was constructed, the system had been operated entirely by direct current, with boosters used where long distances required them. As territory grew to be farther and farther away from the power stations, and as the company looked for ways to increase flexibility to adapt to future growth, it was decided that the best way to increase power capacity was to adopt a new system which would allow them to use large, single stations in central locations with convenient access to coal and water. Current could be distributed without excessive loss to any part of the system, and the high-tension feeders underground removed the need to string heavy overhead cables. The need for a new power house was emphasized when a power station in Ridgewood, Queens, burned down on December 4, 1900. The following month, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that a site had been found on the Gowanus Canal, an active industrial hub in South Brooklyn. The site, located at Third Avenue and First Street, had easy access to coal, water, and other supplies. It was large enough to hold a new building and a large store of coal while also allowing for future expansion. Construction was overseen by Charles Edward Roehl. Work on the building's foundations began in May 1901 and was finished the following January, though further work was delayed by equipment shortages and labor strikes. At the time, it was estimated that the Central Power House would cost $3 million. The brick facade of the building was erected in 1902. Construction was completed in 1903, and the first engine started operating that March. Four engines were operational by June 1903, and by the following year, the structure was declared \\"practically completed\\", with all eight engines working. The Central Power Station's design, which combines elements of Romanesque Revival and classical styles, may have been created by Thomas E. Murray, but there is little definitive evidence in contemporary media. The building is made of red brick with bluestone trimmings, atop piles surmounted by a concrete bed about thick. Its layout was divided into two portions: the southern portion used for the engine and dynamo room, and the northern portion, the boiler house, which was considerably higher and contained two stories of boilers with coal storage above. The front, on Third Avenue, is long, and the depth of the building , although the part which was occupied by boilers is shorter. The roof over the operating and boiler rooms was filled in between the T-irons with hard-burned terracotta roofing tile laid in Portland cement, covered with a slag and cement roofing. The letters were inscribed on the side of the boiler building. Coal was brought to the plant on barges via the adjacent canal. Conveyors moved the coal to be crushed and then to the coal storage in the upper part of the boiler house, to be dropped down to the boilers as needed. To facilitate additional coal storage, the owners purchased an additional lot in 1903. In the other building, eight 4,000 horsepower engines produced both alternative and direct current via different sets of generators. The direct current was used to power nearby train lines while the alternative current was sent through underground cables in terracotta ducts to substations around the city, which would in turn convert it to direct current. The BRT became the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) in 1923 after going bankrupt in the wake of the Malbone Street Wreck. In 1939, shortly before the New York City Board of Transportation was dissolved and the BMT Fifth Avenue Line was demolished, the Central Power Station was renumbered as substation #25. After being renumbered, it took alternating current from the Williamsburg Power House, turning it into direct current. In the 1950s, the boiler house was demolished. The engine house supplied power to the New York City Subway's Fourth Avenue Line, formerly operated by the BMT, until 1972 when the New York City Transit Authority sold it to the government of New York City. Abandonment= Squatter community = alt=The large south-west facing side of the building, with graffiti along the top, several broken windows, and utility vans in a parking lot in the foreground The Batcave became home to squatters in the early 2000s. One of the first squatters, Zach Edminster, said he and a small group began staying there starting in 2001. While only a few people stayed there at first, the size of the group quickly began to grow, comprising mainly homeless and runaway teenagers. A community formed, setting rules for conduct including disallowing hard drug use, and organizing tasks like composting and waste disposal. They set up toilets that operated with rainwater and ran a power line from the Carroll Street Bridge to power a refrigerator and television. Around this time, within the squatting community and then among other locals, the building had begun to be known as the \\"Batcave,\\" named either for bats claimed to have once lived there, or, according to one of the squatters, \\"because that seemed to have an appropriate amount of moral ambiguity\\". In 2004, several other squats around the city were torn down or otherwise evicted, increasing the number of people coming to the Batcave, diminishing the community spirit. In 2006, the New York Daily News ran a sensational article about the space, characterizing it as violent, drug- addled, and dangerous. The reporter talked with people in their teens and twenties who told stories of doing drugs, panhandling, a homeless person thrown out a window, and an addict who overdosed and was left on the street for police to find. The property owners‚ÄîShaya Boymelgreen, Isaac Katan, and Africa-Israel Investments, who purchased the structure in the 2000s‚Äîhad plans to build a large condominium project called Gowanus Village on the land occupied by the building and adjacent lots. In response to the news, they had building security improved, doors welded shut, and hired a guard to keep the building clear. Architectural Digest described the unused, post-squatter building \\"an emblem of gentrification, urban development, and street art\\". =Underground arts and urban exploration= As the Gowanus Village development plan failed to come to fruition, security again became lax. The Batcave became a popular location for graffiti artists, underground parties, concerts, and urban explorers in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The top of the building, facing 3rd Avenue, has displayed a variety of politically oriented messages painted by artists. In 2008, owners Africa-Israel and Katan, who had ended their relationship with Boymelgreen, put the building on the market for $27 million. The following year they updated the listing to say \\"make an offer,\\" and eventually sold it in 2012 for $7 million. Even after the sale, people snuck in for parties, cutting through fences and prompting the new owners to once again tighten security. Powerhouse Workshop In 2012, the Powerhouse Environmental Arts Foundation, a nonprofit founded by philanthropist Joshua Rechnitz, purchased the property for $7 million, with initial plans to turn it into studio space for artists. For a few years after the purchase, Rechnitz and associates discussed the future of the building with local artists, discovering a greater need for a space focused on the production and fabrication of art rather than studio space. Under the name Powerhouse Workshop, it is planned to include space and equipment for woodworking, metalworking, ceramics, printmaking, and fiber arts, as well as exhibition space. Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron is leading the renovation and the executive architects on the project are adaptive reuse and preservation experts, PBDW Architects (Platt Byard Dovell White Architects). Herzog & de Meuron is known for many high-profile projects in New York and internationally, including creating spaces for the arts like the Tate Modern in London, also built in a former power station. This is the second collaboration between the two architecture firms. Their first collaboration was the restoration and design of the Park Avenue Armory. The firm plans to build a six-story addition on the site of the former boiler house, which will increase the building's square footage from 73,958 to 143,041. 24/7 security, safety railings, and other security and safety measures have been put in place in preparation for redevelopment, but the building itself will remain standing and architects and developers have agreed to try to preserve as much of the graffiti on the interior as possible. Powerhouse Workshop was originally planned to open in 2020, but , the opening date had been pushed to 2021. An environmental assessment found high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) contamination, as well as other environmental issues which would require cleanup. When the remediation was certified by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in January 2018, the material removed included 8,375 tons of PCB-contaminated soil and 4,700 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil. In October 2019, in advance of the planned rezoning of the area around the Gowanus Canal, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Gowanus Batcave and four other structures as official city landmarks.

History The first formal representation of Australia in the Dutch East Indies was founded on Batavia by 1935 in form of a trade commissioner based on the Kali Besar West road. While Australia did not maintain many official representations before World War 2, by 1945 it had opened multiple embassies in various countries. Following the proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Australia was dissuaded by Britain from establishing a consulate-general and instead sent a representative to military forces there. In 1946, F.K. Officer was assigned as the representative to Southeast Asia, and was partially tasked with aiding negotiations. After several more representative replacements, in late November 1946 allied forces (AFNEI) left the area and the post of Consul-General was established on 5 December 1946. By 1950 the office was elevated to that of an ambassador, with John Hood becoming the first person to hold that post. =Bombing= In 2004, Jemaah Islamiyah launched a car bomb attack on the embassy, killing at least 9 people and injuring over 170. While several other embassies in the area were also damaged with some diplomats injured, all fatalities were Indonesian nationals. The perpetrators were later arrested and was sentenced to death in 2005. Following the attack, talks on a more secure facility commenced and after a decade the embassy moved to its current building in 2016, occupying over 50,000 square meters and costing $415 million. Located immediately next to the British Embassy, it is both Australia's biggest and most costly embassy as of its completion.

The group formed in 1999 in Washington, D.C. History=1999 - 2000: Formation= Attending college in Washington D.C., Comel and Jaysonic met each other through mutual friends. Active prior to Time Machine, Jaysonic turned Comel on to his body of work, some of which was recorded and produced with DJ Mekalek in Providence R.I.. Standing out was song produced called Sneakers which won the Stretch and Bobbito Battle of the Demos. While sitting in on a bedroom recording session of Jaysonic's Hot Air album, Comel randomly said a verse that would later be recorded for the project. That night would be the group's first song called Block Troopin. Showing musical promise Jaysonic decided to put off a second solo album and would focus on making songs with Comel. On a routine night of block trooping through Washington D.C. Jaysonic would present the idea a being a group to Comel and would come up with the name Time Machine. Stoerok who attended George Washington University was later introduced to Comel and would produce the group's 2nd and 3rd songs \\"A Million a One Things to Do\\" and \\"Reststop Sweetheart\\". With Block Troopin, Reststop Sweetheart and A Million and One Things to Do the groups would release their first 12‚Äù single titled Reststop Sweetheart on Landspeed Records. =2001 - 2004: Vinyl Singles= With college behind them, Jaysonic would move back home to Providence, R.I. where DJ Mekalek also lived, while Stoerok would move back to Boston, M.A. and Comel would remain in Washington D.C.. Though not living together the group would continue to work on music with Stoerok emailing beats and Comel flying up to Providence to record in the basement studio at Jaysonic's house. After the successful reception of Time Machine first 12‚Äù Reststop Sweetheart, the group would leave Landspeed Records and create their own record label Glow-In-The-Dark Records headed by Jaysonic and DJ Mekalek. On that label the group would release their second 12‚Äù single, Personal Ads and follow that up with their 3rd 12‚Äù single Night Lights. A point of note, Night Lights is the only Time Machine song that contains production by Jaysonic. =2004 - 2005: Slow Your Roll= With the recording complete, all members would relocate and move to Los Angeles to be together for the release of their debut album Slow Your Roll. Slow Your Roll consisted of the 12‚Äù singles plus additional works from Time Machine and collaborations with notables such as Special K of the Awesome Two, Ed O.G., and Edan. Released to critical acclaim, Slow Your Roll was noted by many critics as one of the best albums of the year becoming Triple J's album of the week in Australia and receiving XXL's Chairman's Choice. While in Los Angeles the group would work with the popular Hip Hop duo People Under the Stairs collaborating on stage as their opening touring act and in the studio on the 7‚Äù record Tuxedo Rap. =2005 - 2008: Grime Machine, TM Radio, Life Is Expensive= Released during this period was the 12‚Äù single Grime Machine and the compilation album TM Radio. TM Radio was a compilation album of members of Time Machine's solo, rare and unreleased work. Tracks included music from notable Hip Hop groups such as The Procussions, Masta Ace, Ed O.G. and Rashaan Ahmad of Crown City Rockers. Life Is Expensive is Time Machine's second studio album. While featuring jazz samples similar to Slow Your Roll, Life Is Expensive would take its own shape with more electronic based production, samples and dance music tempos. All production would come from DJ Mekalek and Stoerok. Notable MC features of Greg Nice of Nice & Smooth and Cool Calm Pete appear on the record. Well received Life Is Expensive was featured in Billboard magazine's \\"Your Guide to Unsigned Bands\\" and The Source magazine praising the album stating \\"By dropping sonic pretense and being sonically adventurous, Time Machine has created of one of the most distinctive rap albums of 2008.\\" =2012 - Present: Vicious Experiments, The Test of Time= Deciding whether to work on another studio album Time Machine released the mixtape Vicious Experiments. The project featured Jaysonic and Comel over popular production while also featuring original production from DJ Mekalek and Damu The Fudgemunk. In 2018 Time Machine announced the completion of their 3rd studio album The Test of Time with the release date of June 22. Musical Style and Influences A large misconception with Time Machine is that the name actually refers to taking listeners back to another era of hip hop, but this is not the case. Time Machine noted that they have a wide range of musical influences from classic rock, jazz, 1980s dance, soul and R&B; they have also been heavily influenced by late 1980s to early 1990s rap an era also known as the Golden Age. The tools used in the group's production such as the ASR-10 and MPC were popular during that era which lends their sound of sample based melodies to bits of nostalgia. Time Machine lyrically always focused on songs with specific themes. It was an important focus for studio albums that every song be about something specific. The group has been compared to acts such as People Under The Stairs, Giant Panda, and Ugly Ducking.

It has a single thin leaf and up to nine yellowish green to reddish brown flowers. It is mostly only found in coastal and near-coastal heath and woodland between Port Stephens and Ulladulla. Description Genoplesium baueri is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long, about wide with the free part long. Up to nine yellowish green to reddish brown flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are long, wide and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is a broad egg shape, about long, wide with a long thin tip and hairless edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, boat-shaped near the tip and spread widely apart. The petals are egg- shaped, pointed, about long and wide with hairless, sometimes notched edges. The labellum is narrow egg-shaped to lance-shaped, about long, wide with the edges rolled and hairless. There is a fleshy, raised, channelled callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs between December and April and is enhanced by fire the previous summer. Taxonomy and naming The brittle leek orchid was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who published the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (baueri) honours Ferdinand Bauer. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium baueri grows in heath, woodland and forest, mostly in coastal and near-coastal areas. It has been recorded between Port Stephens and Ulladulla and as far inland as Woodford and Penrose State Forest. Conservation This midge orchid is only known from about 200 plants in thirteen sites and has been classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act.

He also made significant contributions to the field of child psychology. Early life Anderson was born in Laramie, Wyoming (1893) and completed his undergraduate work at the University of Wyoming. He travelled east to complete his doctorate in psychology at Harvard University. After graduating, he entered military service during World War I and became the head instructor at the School of Military Psychology at Camp Greenleaf in Georgia. He married Dorothea Lynde of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Career In 1919, Anderson was hired by Yale University. He also assumed the role of Secretary of the APA. In 1925, he moved to the University of Minnesota to become Director of their Rockefeller- funded Institute for Child Welfare. In 1930, he served as Chairman of the Conference Committee on the Infant and Pre-school for the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, which resulted in twenty volumes on the progress in social welfare, health care, and educational facilities of young children. Over the course of the 1930s he published two books on child psychologyNursery Education (1931); The Young Child in the Home (1935). and co-authored the Minnesota Occupational Scale with Florence Goodenough. Anderson's most significant scientific contributions are said to have been a 1939 article on the limitations of intelligence testing with very young children. In 1942, he became editor of Psychological Bulletin, and he was elected president of the APA. His presidency coincided with World War II, so he was a key player in the contentious merger between the old science-oriented APA and the newer practice-oriented American Association for Applied Psychology. This marked the start of the modern APA.See Relinquishing his editorship of Psychological Bulletin after a single term, Anderson immediately wrote a classic chapter on the methods of child psychology which appeared in Leonard Carmichael's 1946 Manual of Child Psychology. He served in executive roles on number of professional and scientific organizations, including Vice President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Section I, Psychology) and President of the Society for Research in Child Development. Death Anderson retired from Minnesota in 1961 and moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he died after a long illness on May 10, 1966.

In 2015 and 2016, Yoshino received awards from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers for general excellence. In January 2018, Yoshino was unexpectedly approached by chief editor Lewis D‚ÄôVorkin while in a meeting, and escorted directly outside without being able to retrieve her personal belongings. There was no explanation to the press or others in the company. It has been speculated by fellow staff members that D‚ÄôVorkin believed Yoshino had leaked unflattering audio recordings of D'Vorkin in meetings to The New York Times and NPR, and possibly that Yoshino had been involved in a scathing piece on D'Vorkin published in the Columbia Journalism Review the day before her firing. It's also suspected the suspension may have been the result of a critical story about Disneyland which had been edited by Yoshino and caused public relations problems for D'Vorkin.

The Giant Powder Company was the first company in the United States to produce dynamite under an exclusive license from Alfred Nobel.  History  The company was incorporated in August 1867 by Julius Bandmann of San Francisco for the express purpose of manufacturing Nobel's newly-patented explosive in the United States. Bandmann immediately began construction of his factory in what was then the remote southern part of San Francisco, now Glen Canyon Park in the Glen Park neighborhood of the city. The facility was ready by early 1868, with production commencing in March.California Historical Landmarks, No. 1002 Giant Powder Company Site, San Francisco - San Francisco The location of this factory is listed as California Historical Landmark number 1002.

During the 1880s, Giant decided to start manufacturing its own acids, creating a rift with partner Judson who then left the company and formed his own in 1890, the Judson Explosives and Powder Company. He constructed his own facility nearby, on the northwest side of the Cerrito de San Antonio (later re-named \\"Albany Hill\\").

From this circle on the diagonal proceed 4 rays, on their tops are 4 small circles, inside of which are the allegorical symbols of the evangelists (see tetramorph), or less often, the images of the four evangelists themselves. Fragments of the human face ‚Äì eyes, nose and mouth are placed in the segments of the next circle. Above this circle on the central axis depicted the Virgin Mary with arms raised. The next circle is green or red, it can represent the sky, sometimes starry. In the outermost circle usually depicted seraphim, or angels with scrolls. Above it on the central axis is a truncated circle, in which the heaven is depicted, God the Father with a gesture of blessing is seen in this circle. From God the Father emanates the Holy Spirit, descending in the form of a dove on the head of the Theotokos. The inscriptions found in the icon: * Around the red face: ‚ÄúThe Burning Coal appeared to Isaiah, the sun arose from the virgin‚Äôs womb, bringing to those who wandered in darkness the light of the knowledge of God.‚Äù * Around the green circle: ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant.‚Äù (Luke 1:46‚Äì48) * Around the blue circle: ‚ÄúYour eyes will be upon the faithful of the land, and greet them with cherubim who glorifying God.‚Äù * Around God the Father and outermost circle: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, the glory of the Lord of Hosts is full of heaven and earth.‚Äù * Around the innermost circle: ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.‚Äù (Luke 2:14)  Controversy  Some modern clergymen do not approve the use of such icons. Metropolitan Hilarion considers that such icons ‚Äúare not canonical, they do not correspond to any church text and believers should not pray in front of them.‚Äù  Gallery  File:Ikone Auge Gottes.jpg File:–ê–±—Ä–∞–∑ \\"–°–ø–∞—Å –£—Å–µ–±–∞—á–Ω–∞–µ –≤–æ–∫–∞ –∑ –ê–Ω—ë–ª–∞–º –ê—Ö–æ—û–Ω—ñ–∫–∞–º —ñ –°–≤. –í–∞—Å—ñ–ª—ë–º –í—è–ª—ñ–∫—ñ–º\\".JPG File:Eye of Providence (icon, 19th c.).jpg  References  Russian icons Paintings depicting Jesus 19th- century paintings ","title":"Eye of Providence (icon)"},{"id":"56436205","text":"Several ships have borne the name Caledonia for Caledonia: * was launched in India and made three voyages to England for the British East India Company (EIC).

His father was a cavalry officer and he seemed destined for a military career. At the time of the coup that brought Napoleon III to power he was a sub-lieutenant in the infantry. He signed a document voting against the coup, and was forced to resign. After a difficult period, he found work as a journalist throughout the remainder of the Second French Empire and the early years of the French Third Republic. He was a radical republican, and was elected deputy for the Seine department from 1886 to 1889. Early years Alfred Nicolas Gaulier was born on 10 November 1829 in Paris. His parents were was Jean-Baptiste Gaulier (b. 1772), retired cavalry squadron leader, Knight of Saint-Louis and Officer of the Legion of Honour, and Anne Antoinette Gouget (b. 1802). His grandfather, Ren√© Gaulier, was a carpenter. His father had participated in most of the campaigns of the French First Republic and First French Empire, and had been decorated at Jena. Alfred Gaulier was educated at the Prytan√©e National Militaire in La Fl√®che, a preparatory school for boys planning a military career. In 1847 Gaulier was made a sub-lieutenant of the 49th infantry line regiment. He was admitted to the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1848. He was a second lieutenant in the 53rd line infantry regiment at the time of the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851. He was one of the few officers, and the only one in the Paris garrison, who signed their name to a vote against the coup. He was brought before a board of inquiry for habitual misconduct and lack of honour, and Marshal Bernard Pierre Magnan suspended him from employment. As a result, he was forced to resign from the army. Journalist Gaulier moved to Paris and struggled to make a living in the early years of the Second French Empire. He became a journalist and was soon established with the democratic press. He married and had one child. He was a contributor to L'Int√©r√™t public in 1867. One of his articles in L'Int√©r√™t Public earned him punishment from the Correctional Police. He was a copy editor at L'√âlecteur libre, and editor at Actionnaires and Le Temps (1867). During the electoral assemblies of May 1869 Gaulier noted in Le Temps that if a crowd formed the police were as much responsible as the organizers, During the Paris Commune (28 March ‚Äì 28 May 1871) Gaulier was Editor in Chief at La Discussion (12‚Äì16 May 1871). He was owner, manager and editor in chief of the ephemeral La Politique (17 May ‚Äì 1 June 1871). La Politique, the organ of the Paris League of Rights, was first suppressed by the Commune and then by the Versaille government, whose excesses he condemned. He was parliamentary editor to Le Rappel (1871‚Äì1886). He succeeded Camille Pelletan in this position. He also contributed to La R√©publique fran√ßaise. Political career Gaulier's short political career began after Ernest Roche was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment for participating in the organization of 1886 miner's strikes in Anzin. Henri Rochefort resigned from his seat as a deputy, triggering a by- election in which the socialists combined to nominate Roche as their candidate. Georges Clemenceau decided not to support Roche, and instead sponsored Alfred Gaulier as the Radical candidate. He was supported by the radical press. Gaulier was elected Deputy for Seine on 2 May 1886. Roche received over 100,000 votes, but Gaulier won the election with 146,000 votes, while small numbers of votes went to candidates such as M. Soubri√©, supported by the possiblists. According to The Living Age, Gaulier sat with the Radical Left group. On 7 June 1886 his confirmation hearings led to a debate on his character. The newspapers L'Intransigeant and Cri du peuple had accused him of having been dismissed from the army for offenses against honour. He said he had freely resigned after voting against the coup d'√©tat. He was reproached for having contracted debts with his regiment. He replied that his total debts had been no more than 1,600 francs, and asked the Minister of War, General Boulanger, to speak for him. Boulanger confirmed what Gaulier had said, and called on anyone who had never owed money to throw the first stone. Gaulier was confirmed. Gaulier generally voted with the radicals. In December 1886 he submitted a proposal to changes the procedural rules on votes of confidence in a ministry. On 11 February 1887 he voted against reinstating the district ballot. He voted against the indefinite postponement of revision to the constitution, against prosecution of three members of the Ligue des Patriotes and against the draft Lisbonne law restricting the freedom of the press. He abstained from voting on the prosecution of General Boulanger. His term ended on 11 November 1889. Alfred Gaulier died on 17 January 1898 in Paris.

It was built in 1904 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Courthouse in 2017, showing first floor entrance Columbia, South Dakota, was the site of Brown County's first courthouse until 1887 when Aberdeen became the county seat. A dispute followed, and the county seat moved back to Columbia from November 1889 until 1890, after which Aberdeen permanently became the county seat. After becoming the county seat, a wood frame courthouse building was built in Aberdeen. Work on a new courthouse in Aberdeen began by 1902, designed by architects Frank W. Kinney and Menno S. Detweiler. It was built by E. Miller of Le Mars, Iowa, and completed in 1904 at a cost of around $120,000. Two half blocks of land were donated by several property owners and a street was removed for the courthouse site. The courthouse was formally dedicated on March 15, 1904. The old courthouse was demolished in 1905 and the site was turned into a park. In 1974, the sandstone stairway that led to the second floor entrance was removed to improve accessibility; it was replaced by a plate glass entrance on the first floor. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1976. In 2014, after suffering deterioration, the stained glass window around the old entrance was removed, cleaned, and reinstalled. Architecture The dome, one clock face, and statue of Justice as seen from the west The courthouse is a three-story building in the Renaissance Revival style. The building is made of Berea Sandstone that was quarried near Cleveland, Ohio. The front facade faces south and is divided into thirteen bays. The entrance is flanked by two Corinthian columns made of Ortonville granite. The original second-floor entrance is encircled by a two-story-tall arch of stained glass. The building is topped by a dome with four clocks facing each of north, south, east and west. On top of the dome is a copper statue of Justice. The courthouse originally stood alone on the block; later on an addition was built at the southwest corner for more offices and a jail was built at the southeast corner.

It arose from the need to keep children still while the photograph was taken due to the long exposure times of early cameras. History The daguerreotypes that became publicly available during the 1840s had exposure times from tens of seconds to several minutes. While exposure times shrank as photographic technology developed, to get a clear picture of a child during the 19th century the child had to be persuaded to stay still, which could be difficult to achieve. One technique was for the mother‚Äîsometimes the father, a nanny or the photographer's assistant‚Äîto be hidden within the frame, often behind curtains, under cloaks, or disguised as chairs. Mothers were also sometimes obscured simply by removing parts of the photograph afterward, or by them standing slightly off to one side so they could be cropped out. How successfully the mother was hidden varied. Sometimes, simply draped with fabric, their shape would be obvious. In some photographs, arms are clearly visible. A paper overlay could be used when framing the photograph to hide the parts showing the mother, focusing on the child instead. The practice of hidden mother photography continued into the 1920s, fading away as cameras became faster and more ubiquitous. 21st-century interest Interest in hidden mother photography spiked in the 2010s, driven in part by the rise of the Internet, which made the images more easily available. This in turn raised interest in collections of them at museums such as the Palmer Museum of Art. A Flickr pool was set up dedicated to collecting hidden mother images. Having collected them for a decade, in 2013 Italian-Swedish artist Linda Fregni Nagler displayed 997 photographs in a series entitled The Hidden Mother at the Venetian Arsenal for the 55th Venice Biennale. She also published them in the book The Hidden Mother (2013) with words by Geoffrey Batchen and the Biennale's curator, Massimiliano Gioni. The images were produced between the 1840s and the 1920s using a variety of techniques. They include daguerreotypes, ambrotypes (which use the wet plate collodion process), tintypes and albumen prints. The first picture that prompted the collection was a 5√ó4 centimetre tintype described on eBay as \\"funny baby with hidden mother\\". Nagler's theory as to why the mothers are hidden, rather than simply appearing in the picture undisguised, is that \\"The mothers seem to have been aiming to create an intimate bond between the child and the viewer, rather than between themselves and the child.\\" In 2014 and 2015, photographer Laura Larson presented a series of around 35 hidden mother photographs as a touring exhibition. Her book, Hidden Mother (2017), told the story of her daughter's adoption from Ethiopia through 26 hidden mother photographs. It was shortlisted for the Paris Photo‚ÄìAperture Foundation PhotoBook Award that year. Lee Marks, a photography dealer from Indiana, is another long-term collector with around 600 hidden mother images. The eerie effect of the half-obscured mothers in these pictures has led to them being compared to ghosts, including by Larson. Larson's collection began as an offshoot of her study of spirit photography of the Victorian era. {role=\\"presentation\\" style=\\"margin: 0 auto\\"  alt=Toddler in a white coat and knitted hat and scarf sat on a pair of trousered knees.

After the United States entered the war in April 1917 its soldiers, as part of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), began to arrive France later that year. To deal with casualties the AEF would take they set a series of hospitals throughout Europe. The unit was mobilized on November 21, 1917, at the 12th Regiment Armory, NYC and trained until it left for Europe. The base personal left New York on the RMS Olympic, arriving in Liverpool, England, March 6, 1918.

It reached its final destination, Vichy, Department Allier, in the intermediate section, A. E. F., where it arrived March 12, 1918. It took over nine hotels that the French had been using as hospital units and was ready to receive patients just eight days later on March 20, 1918.

It lasted for only eight years, merging with the American Psychological Association in 1945. Although short-lived, it has been claimed that some of its work led to what is now the basis of certain models of training in the field. Origins Applied psychologists who were without PhDs or did not have academic affiliations were not, early in the 20th century, given full membership privileges at the scientifically-oriented American Psychological Association (APA). The AAAP, by contrast, accepted these psychologists. It had grown from the New York Association of Consulting Psychologists (NYACP), established in 1921 through the efforts of Leta Hollingworth and others. A practitioner with a University of Pennsylvania PhD but no academic affiliation named David Mitchell became the NYACP's first president. The NYACP soon began reaching out to applied psychologists in other states, changing its name to the Association of Consulting Psychologists (ACP) in 1930. Creation of AAAP It was, ironically, at the 1936 meeting of the rival APA at Dartmouth College that a dinner meeting was held where it was decided to expand the ACP into a fully national organization called the AAAP. In 1937, the remnants of the old Clinical Section of the APA officially disbanded and re-formed as the first Division of the new AAAP. It was immediately followed by Divisions for Consulting, Educational, and Business/Industrial psychology. A Military Psychology Division was added later. The first president of the AAAP was Douglas H. Fryer. Later well-known presidents included Donald Patterson, Walter V. Bingham, Albert Poffenberger, and Carl Rogers. During World War II, the U.S. military had a great need of professionals to treat soldiers suffering from battle fatigue and other mental illnesses. In response, a committee of the APA led by David Shakow, who had already started this work on a similar committee within the structure of the AAAP established formal guidelines for the training of the clinical psychologists. The guidelines established the scientist-practitioner model of training. Merger With APA At the end of the War, the APA and AAAP merged to form a new APA in which scientists and practitioners had equal standing in the association. The new organization adopted the divisional structure of the old AAAP, adding twelve new Divisions to the old AAAP's five (there are now over 50). The new APA also held meetings to establish guidelines for clinical training, essentially adopting David Shakow's earlier document at a landmark meeting in Boulder, Colorado.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty small, dark purplish red flowers. It grows in heathy forest and on the edges of swamps in the Gibraltar Range National Park. Description Genoplesium bishopii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between fifteen and thirty dark purplish red flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are long and wide and lean forward. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The lateral sepals are about long, wide, turn downwards and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are about long, wide with hairless edges and a small white gland on the tip. The labellum is long, wide, thick and fleshy with many short hairs on the sides. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming The Gibraltar Range midge orchid was first formally described in 2000 by David Jones who gave it the name Genoplesium bishopii and published the description in The Orchadian. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis bishopii but the change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium bishopii is only known from the Gibraltar Range National Park where it grows in heathy forest and on the edge of swamps.

She has held several high-profile positions at The Nature Conservancy, served as Executive Secretary of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, and is currently Managing Director of the Climate program at the Outrider Foundation. Nelson is the daughter of former United States Senator and Governor Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day. Early life  Nelson was born on June 21, 1956 in the Crestwood neighborhood of Madison, Wisconsin. She was two years old when her father was elected Governor of Wisconsin. She lived in the Executive Residence (Governor's Mansion) in Maple Bluff, Wisconsin until the age of six, when her father was elected to United States Senate. She spent her upbringing in Washington, D.C. until graduating from high school and returning to Wisconsin to attend college. Nelson often accompanied her father during campaign stops throughout his political career. Career After graduating from UW‚ÄìMadison's school of wildlife ecology and clerking for the Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Natural Resources, Nelson joined The Nature Conservancy as legislative liaison for government relations. She spent 17 years with the organization, also holding posts as a senior policy advisor for the Latin America and Caribbean Division and then, as the first director of the Conservancy's Global Climate Change Initiative. During her time with the group, Nelson worked in more than 25 countries, and was in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 when President George H.W. Bush signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit, the U.S. commitment to help fight global warming. While at The Nature Conservancy, Nelson advocated for forest protection and restoration as a critical climate change mitigation strategy and an essential component of public policies to address global warming. She led the development of pilot carbon sequestration projects in Belize, Bolivia, and Brazil, where she helped create standards for the measurement and verification of the greenhouse gas benefits of conservation and improved timber management. The Rio Bravo project in Belize was the first one of its kind in the world to be certified by the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation, and earned her the Climate Protection Award in 2000 from the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2004, Nelson returned home to Wisconsin to serve as Executive Secretary to the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands (BCPL), which included an appointment in 2007 as co‚Äêchair of Wisconsin's Task Force on Global Warming. In July 2005, Nelson spoke at her father's memorial service which was held at the Wisconsin Capitol Building. Nelson introduced Michelle Obama during a rally before the 2008 presidential primary in Wisconsin. In 2009, Nelson testified before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee regarding the American Clean Energy and Security Act. The legislation would have cut carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 and by 83 percent by mid-century. While serving as Executive Secretary to the BCPL, Nelson was ordered to never discuss climate change on state time by two of the three board members‚Äîthe Attorney General and the State Treasurer. The Attorney General later changed his position on the \\"gag\\" order and went on to express strong support for Nelson's job performance in a letter released to the press. Nelson left her post at the state agency in 2015 and is currently the Managing Director of the Climate program at the Outrider Foundation, a Madison, Wisconsin group which works to end the threat of a nuclear war and reverse global climate change. Nelson introduced U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders at an October 2016 Madison rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Nelson voiced her support for Clinton and U.S. Senate CandidateRuss Feingold based on their advocacy for clean energy policies. Other roles * Through the UW-Madison Nelson Institute and Wisconsin Historical Society, Nelson helped launch www.nelsonearthday.net, a site which houses the Gaylord Nelson Collection. * Nelson is a trustee emeritus at the Northland College Board and has served on the boards of the Earth Day Network, Gathering Waters Conservancy, Cool Choices, and the Friends of the Apostle Islands. * She is also an emeritus board member of the UW- Madison Nelson Institute of Environmental Studies Board of Visitors. *Nelson is a member of the ecoAmerica Board of Directors. * Nelson has served as an advisor to several councils including the World Bank's Bio Carbon Fund, the Chicago Climate Exchange, and the Climate Neutral Network.

As a type of superabsorbent polymer, it can absorb hundreds times its original weight in purified water. Different from sodium polyacrylate, potassium polyacrylate can be used as water retaining agent in agriculture and won't cause soil salinization.  Uses = Water retaining agent = As a type of superabsorbent polymer for plants (Ag-SAP), potassium polyacrylate can increase moisture availability to plants. It mixes with soil to increase the soil‚Äôs capacity for holding water (with water gel form which stay in soil for months) and making it available to plants. This improved soil readily releases moisture, along with water-soluble nutrients, to plant roots on demand. The specific retention of potassium polyacrylate is weaker than roots of most plants. It can be used in seed coating, grow seedlings, planting crops, topdressing for crops, planting/transplanting trees, flower transport etc.  Mechanism  Potassium polyacrylate works similar to a sponge under the soil surface. It is composed of a set of polymeric chains, which are linked together chemically to become a water-insoluble, net-like matrix that gently attracts and holds hydrogen molecules. The immense size and weight of its molecular structure allows each potassium polyacrylate granule to absorb over 500 times its original weight in purified water. It does not ‚Äòbind‚Äô water tightly. The potassium polyacrylate granules release just the right amount of water in response to a plant‚Äôs root suction. There is no waterlogging or other ill effects caused by ‚Äòfree‚Äô water filling air cavities in the soil. Potassium polyacrylate maximizes plant growth by reducing plant stress. It also absorbs and releases soil nutrients, water-soluble fertilizer and chemicals in the same manner as water, creating a healthy microenvironment in the plant root zone. The result is faster germination, quicker emergence of seeds, consistent growth and higher, better-quality yields of edibles with less water and fewer inputs. As a soil amendment, potassium polyacrylate can improve the soil water holding capacity.

Much of Norway's wealth is linked to its long coastline; for example, the petroleum industry, maritime transport, fishing, and fish farming.

Early life and education  Stein was born in New York City in 1945. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, between 1964 and 1966, and the University of California at Berkeley between 1966 and 1968. He studied architecture at MIT and sculpture at the University of California at Berkeley.  Work  Stein's earliest work consisted of large acrylic or alkyd on gessoed canvas paintings in the minimalist mode which he has described as ‚Äúanti-paintings.‚Äù As he explained to Mousse Magazine in 2017, ‚ÄúI was using painting to deconstruct painting. I wasn‚Äôt thinking of making fun of painting, but they‚Äôre funny paintings.‚Äù The artist was represented in the Whitney Annual (precursor to the Whitney Biennial) in 1969 at age 24. His first exhibits, all solo shows, were at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles, the David Whitney Gallery in New York and the Rolf Ricke Gallery in Cologne, Germany between 1969 and 1972. He was introduced to each of these galleries by the noted dealer Richard Bellamy. Bellamy, in turn, had in turn been introduced to Stein by the artist and critic Brian O‚ÄôDoherty who had visited the artist at his Oakland studio in 1968. Stein's output expanded to include object pieces, installations and photographic-based art over the succeeding decades. A retrospective of Stein's works between 1968 and 1971 was held in the fall of 2017 at New York's Essex Street Gallery. Artforum‚Äôs critic determined that Stein‚Äôs object pieces, ‚Äúisolated and stripped of their abilities to punish, regulate or restrict,‚Äù offered ‚Äúa kind of realism predicated on the physiological response to stimulus‚Äîa rare opportunity to be intimate with a set of specific spatial relationships that govern conduct.‚Äù. Frieze Magazine's reviewer, Josephine Graf, appraised the show as making ‚Äúa compelling argument for revisiting Stein‚Äôs oeuvre. Stein separates the readymade from its Duchampian irony, revealing instead how everyday objects can guide visibility and delimit movement in a subtle and concise form of policing.‚Äù Evaluating the same exhibit, Art Review scribe Jeppe Ugelvig opined that ‚ÄúLewis spatialized and readymades are--like most derivatives of ‚Äòhostile‚Äô and ‚Äòregulatory‚Äô architectures‚Äîseductive in their violence, and their position as deeply antagonistic in particular, to the idealist project of Minimalism and its pursuit of perceptual objectivity.‚Äù A thread that runs through much of Stein‚Äôs work is the effect of perceptual structures upon human experiences. Of a 1986 show at Postmasters Gallery featuring a series of household hammers--one of the artist‚Äôs earliest works--alongside photographs of light sources from the '80s, Art in America critic, Paul Smith, observed that both the hammers and the photographic images ‚Äúcan be seen as addressing a similar deadened frustration of function and expectation in traditional art.‚Äù He noted that Stein's ‚Äúother recent photographic series--of surveillance cameras, shadows and chandeliers suggest that he is not so interested in frusEssex tration per se as he is in the rich visual possibilities of the readymade world.‚Äù In a series of photographs of cows begun in the 1990s, Stein photographs the animals staring directly into the viewer's eyes, prompting him to wonder if he himself is being examined by the cow. The contrast between expectation and reality is another theme recurring throughout Stein's works. For a 1990 exhibit at the Paula Allen Gallery consisting of photographs of mirrors from the pages of mail order catalogs blown-up to life size, Artforum reviewer John Miller felt a sense of ‚Äúa creeping shoddiness overriding the too-familiar elegance this hybridization typically yields and relies upon.‚Äù Instead of evoking glamour or polish, the \\"specific of mail order furnishings does not exactly conjure up visions of luxury,‚Äù Miller concluded. Likening a series of Stein's photographs of chandeliers to ‚Äúswitched-on May Ray,‚Äù the New Yorker declared that ‚ÄúA single idea--that light is photogenic--goes quite far.‚Äù [10] The Village Voice described the same show as ‚Äúbig, dumb, black-and-white pictures of electric chandeliers glowing out of pitch black space [that] ‚Äúfill the gallery with a cold, postmod light.‚Äù Like other artists who were shaped by the ferment of the 1960s. Stein's work also addresses social and political issues of the day. Of his black-and-white photographs of surveillance cameras which appeared in a show at New York's Queen's Museum in 1986, curator Marc H. Miller declared that ‚ÄúThough 1984 has come and gone, Orwell‚Äôs vision of Big Brother is still a real possibility‚Ä¶.Stein's photographs are a reminder that TV is not just something we watch, but something that is watching us.‚Äù Of the artist's playfully ironic stock photograph of an Oster brand blender perched alongside strawberries and a pink milkshake in a House Beautiful-perfect kitchen, critic Noah Dillon opined: ‚ÄúWithout an advertiser‚Äôs text, Stein‚Äôs photograph points less to the blender that is its formal centerpiece, and more to the amorphous sense of fulfillment the machine is equipped to provide.‚Äù Among his influences, Stein cites Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, Ad Reinhardt and Robert Morris. Stein's work has been shown in galleries and museums throughout the United States. It is also held in numerous public and private collections.      References =Sources= * Meyer-Stoll, Christiane.

Even before the collapse of Soviet Union, Azerbaijan was a popular medical tourism destination and saw many visitors, particularly due to its health spas. Medical tourism in Azerbaijan The spas of Naftalan, Azerbaijan attracted roughly 75,000 visitors a year during the height of the 1980s, even though the industry was stunted by the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the end of Soviet- sponsored spa trips. Since 2008, Azerbaijan has stepped up its efforts to turn itself into a health tourism destination. The National Government's State Program for the Development of Resorts for Medical Tourism has resulted in the opening of medical centers in Baku, Masalli, Nakchivan, Naftalan, and other regions. Ruslan Guliyev, who leads the Medical Support and the Thermal Tourism Association of Azerbaijan, has said that Azerbaijan is home to curative resources such as therapeutic mud, mineral water, and Naftalan oil, a grade of black oil known for its use in alternative medicine. Treatment is in the form of bathing in this special grade of warm crude oil. Doctors in Azerbaijan have claimed that Naftalan crude baths can cure more than 70 diseases, including skin, joint, and neurological ailments, even though Western Medicine experts have rebutted this claim and stated that the Naftalan crude ingredient naphthalene is possibly carcinogenic. Crude naphthalene (obtained directly from production wells); purified naphthalene (with various additives to increase its density); naphthalene cleaned from resin; naphthenic hydrocarbons; and naphthalene mastic (which consists of naftalan, paraffin, wax, ceresin, and camphor) are all used in these treatments. The Duzdag Hotel in Nakhchivan, Istisu Masalli, and the Qalaalti Hotel & Spa in Shabran region have been cited as some of the most popular health resorts in the world. Notable Institutes =Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Hospital= This hospital is named after the region in which it is present. The president, Ilham Aliyev, attended the opening ceremony of the hospital on Dec 1, 2015. The hospital consists of an eight-story building, two auditoriums, seven classrooms, a computer room, a conference hall, a medical and sports center, and medical checkup rooms for students at the time of its inauguration. In addition, there are 14 inpatient departments, 300 beds and more than 130 doctors. The hospital also has departments of traumatology, emergency and urgent medical care, general therapy, neurology, hematology, eye diseases, otorhinolaryngology, endocrine disorders, proctology, urology, surgery, neurosurgery, resuscitation, and rehabilitation.Duzdag Physiotherapy Center Halotherapy in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Since the beginning of the second half of 20th century, world medicine began new treatment methods for bronchial asthma illness in karst caves and salt mines. After further research, doctors concluded that sodium and chlorine ions in salt mines have positive effects on lung bronchial diseases via halotherapy or speleotherapy, both of which are proposed treatments for asthma and other respiratory diseases that involve breathing inside caves. Professional specialists in various medical fields work at the Duzdag Physiotherapy Center at the Duzdag Hotel, where allergic diseases, especially bronchial asthma, are treated. People from all regions of Azerbaijan, as well as foreign tourists, regularly visit the center.Gobustan. Mud volcanoes More than 350 mud volcanoes exist in eastern Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea region. Volcanic mud is known for having healing properties due to its ingredients such as mineral salts and organic compounds. Mud-pouring volcanoes can be found in many parts of the world, but one-third of Azerbaijan's mud volcanoes are concentrated within a 16,000-square-kilometer area. Mud volcanoes are most prevalent in the Absheron Peninsula, Shamakhi-Gobustan, Lower Kurian Lowland, Baku Archipelago and near the Georgian border.

In 1913, Parsons helped to organize the National Radium Institute to study the extraction of radium from carnotite ores and create a domestic process for its extraction, rather than exporting the raw material and importing radium. He was deeply interested in the use of radium to treat cancerous tumors. In 1916, during World War I, Parsons was transferred to the War Department, with the position of Chief Engineer. He was sent to Europe to study the fixation of nitrogen and oxidation of ammonia, which were important for the production of fertilizer and explosives. At his recommendation, four factories were built, entering production after the end of the war. Parsons was also responsible for arranging for a census of American chemists. When the United States entered the war in April 1917, selected chemists were released from military service to carry out research on projects considered important to the war effort. Parsons helped to organize the Chemical Warfare Service of the US Army. In 1919, after the end of the war, Parsons left the Bureau of Mines. = American Chemical Society = Parsons became a member of the American Chemical Society (ACS) when he attended the World Congress of Chemists at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. From 1907 until 1919, Parsons was part-time secretary of the American Chemical Society, succeeding William A. Noyes. From 1919 to 1946, Parsons was full-time executive secretary of the ACS, its chief administrative officer, in charge of its day-to-day operations. He retired on December 31, 1945 after the end of World War II. Parsons was closely involved, along with Marston T. Bogert, in establishing a new structure for the ACS. He helped to transform it from a New York State Corporation into a national organization based in Washington, D.C. He was also involved with the creation of a number of divisions, organized around specialized groups, beginning with Industrial Chemists and Chemical Engineers. He is credited with substantially expanding the association's membership and its publications. Under his leadership, its roster expanded from 3000 members in 1908 to 40,000 in 1945. The number of journals published by the society increased from two to eight. The annual budget of the organization expanded from several thousand dollars to 1.5 million dollars. In addition, Parsons served as secretary of Section C of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from 1904 to 1908. He served as Vice president for America of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), from 1919 to 1922. Awards and honors In 1911, Parsons received an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Maine. In 1915 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh. In 1944, he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of New Hampshire. Parsons received a number of international honors as a result of his work. In 1922, he was named an officer of the French Legion of Honour. In 1926, he was named Cavalier of the Order of the Crown of Italy. In 1926, he was named an Honorary member 0f the Romanian Chemical Society and a life member of the Soci√©t√© chimique de France. In 1931 he became an honorary member of the Society of Chemical Industry of Great Britain. He also received American awards at a national level. In 1932 he received the Priestley Medal for distinguished service, the highest honor conferred by the American Chemical Society. In 1948, he became an honorary member of the American Institute of Chemists, and an honorary member of The Chemists' Club in New York. The Charles Lathrop Parsons Award of the American Chemical Society is named in his honor and was first presented, to him, in 1952. It is awarded to members of the ACS for public service in the field of chemistry.

The Belfast City and District Water Commissioners was a public body in northern Ireland, established by the Belfast Water Act 1840, to improve the supply of water to the expanding city of Belfast. By 1852, the city was suffering a shortfall in supply of almost one million gallons per day.Short History of Belfast‚Äôs Mourne Water Supply. William R Darby, EARC, 2 November 2010. Retrieved 29 January 2018.Luke Livingstone Macassey (1843 - 1908). Patrick Devlin, Dictionary of Ulster Biography. Retrieved 29 January 2018. In 1891, the Commissioners appointed local civil engineer, Luke Livingston Macassey to identify water resources to sustain Belfast. Five potential sites were surveyed in County Down, and County Antrim. Macassey ultimately decided on the Mourne Mountains in Down. Upon deciding on the site, water commissioners agreed on securing a catchment area. Private Acts of Parliament (in 1893, 1897 and 1899) allowed the purchase of the Mournes land and related access permits and water rights. At the time the catchment was capable of providing some of water per day, but this was too much. A scheme was developed and divided into three phases. The first stage was to divert water from the Kilkeel and Annalong river through pipes to a reservoir near Carryduff. These water pipes were capable of supplying of water per day. Work was completed in 1901. The second stage was to build a storage reservoir, the Silent Valley Reservoir, across the Kilkeel River, after new pipes laid there were able to supply another of water per day. Design work on this phase began in 1910, but procurement of the work was delayed by World War I. A contract was eventually awarded in 1923 to S. Pearson & Son and work continued until 1933.

The unit languished in Yreka until 1998, when the McCloud Railway bought the unit to assist 25 in railfan trips. McCloud Rails - Engine #18 =Restoration and Present= The locomotive was restored to operation at McCloud in 1998, and quickly became the favorite unit as it was bigger and stronger than #25 and handled the large grades on the road better. In 2005, with the imminent demise of the McCloud Railway as a financial entity, the unit was sold to Virginia and Truckee Railroad as an excursion unit. They acquired the #18 in 2007, and it has been in use since 2010.

Andrews is a Professor of Black Studies in the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University. He is the director of the Centre for Critical Social Research, founder of the Harambee Organisation of Black Unity, and co-chair of the UK Black Studies Association. Andrews is the first black studies professor in the UK and led the establishment of the first black studies programme in Europe at Birmingham City University. Andrews earned a PhD in Sociology and Cultural Studies from the University of Birmingham in 2011. His thesis was entitled \\"Back to Black: Black Radicalism and the Supplementary School Movement\\". He is of British African-Caribbean heritage. Andrews has criticised universities in the United Kingdom for institutional racism, specifically a lack of diversity in students' assigned readings. Andrews has criticised non-white members of the Conservative Party, saying that a \\"cabinet packed with ministers with brown skin wearing Tory masks represents the opposition of racial progress\\".  Journalism and media appearances  Andrews regularly appears in the media discussing issues of race and racism, colonialism and slavery, and British nationalism. He is a frequent contributor to The Guardian, and has written articles for The Independent, New Statesman, CNN, openDemocracy, and often appears as a guest on the BBC and Good Morning Britain. In May 2020, Andrews was a guest on Russell Brand's YouTube channel discussing racism in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. He was also interviewed by the Los Angeles Review of Books discussing Malcolm X and the question of violence in Black radicalism. In 2019, Andrews took part in a debate on whether or not the West should pay reparations for slavery at Intelligence Squared. He also spoke about his book Back to Black at the John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies at Duke University and gave a talk at Tate Liverpool on the role of Black radicalism in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2017, Andrews spoke at the Oxford Union, arguing that British education perpetuates racism. He also gave a TEDxYouth talk in Birmingham entitled 'How to stay radical within an institution' exploring how Black Studies can exist within the historically racist institution of the university. Andrews also narrated the film The Psychosis of Whiteness which explores race and racism through cinematic representations of the slave trade.

Definitions of what the defence industry comprises and estimates of its size differ, but it was believed to have employed between 12,000 and 29,000 people as of the mid 2010s. The industry has grown over recent years, and Australian Defence Magazine reported that the 40 largest companies had a total revenue of $A 9.2 billion in 2015. History The need for a domestic defence industry was established after Australia's participation in the Boer War made apparent the logistical issues of troops arriving with different equipment to that used by the British, causing issue with the supply of ammunition and field repair of weapons. Thus, after the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1901, the Government resolved to make Australia independent of British munitions and armament supplies. In 1907 the decision was made to establish Lithgow Small Arms Factory for the manufacture of small arms in Australia. During World War 1, Australia manufactured SMLE III rifles for the Australian army. During World War 2, this production was expanded to include 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns, Vickers guns and Bren guns, among other similar products. Australia's aircraft industry took off prior to World War 2, with the establishment of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1937 by Essington Lewis. It was a private company formed by a consortium to manufacture military aircraft with the intention of providing Australia with the tools to fight the modern war that was looming. The CAC manufactured many aircraft, both of domestic designs and under licence, including the Wirraway, the Boomerang, and CAC Wackett. De Havilland Australia, which was founded in 1927, produced for the Royal Australian Air Force beginning in the late 1930s with products including DH.82 Tiger Moths and DH.94 Moth Minors. De Havilland Australia acquired Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1985 and was purchased by Boeing in 2000. Post-war domestic production of American aircraft designs includes the licensed production of the F-86 Sabre between 1954 and 1961 and assembly of F/A-18A/B Hornets from 1985 to 1990. Current scale As there is no agreed definition of what the Australian defence industry comprises it is difficult to determine the size of the sector. Many of the companies which supply goods and services to the military also have a significant civilian market, and their staff often work on items intended for both military and civilian customers. The Australian Government's 2018 Defence Export Strategy provided the following definition: A 2015 parliamentary inquiry into the defence industry noted that \\"published estimates of the number of people employed in the defence industry have cited varying figures\\". The federal government body Skills Australia estimated in 2012 that between 15,000 and 25,000 were employed in the industry. In 2010 the Department of Defence put the figure at up to 29,000 people, and in 2015 it advised the inquiry that around 27,000 people were directly employed in the industry. The 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement stated that 25,000 people were employed in the defence industry, of whom around 50 percent worked in global defence companies. If accurate, this estimate means that the industry represents 0.24% of total employment, and is equivalent to 2.9% of jobs in the total manufacturing sector. In January 2016 Australian Defence Magazine reported that the 40 largest Australian defence companies had a combined revenue of $A 9.2 billion in 2015. A 2017 Australian Strategic Policy Institute report stated that the defence industry \\"accounts for 0.22% of Australian industry and 1.7% of the manufacturing sector\\", and \\"although [the] Australian defence industry is undoubtedly important for our defence force, it represents only a trifling fraction of the overall Australian economy. Exports and imports The scale of the Australian defence industry's exports is greatly outweighed by the scale of imports of military goods and services into Australia. Between 2001 and 2016, the total value of defence exports from Australia measured using the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's methodology represented 6.8 percent of the total value of defence imports into Australia. There was considerable variation in this ratio between years. As of 2018, the total value of Australian defence exports was around $A2 billion per year. While this made Australia the 20th largest exporter of defence goods and services, it represented only around half of one percent of the global arms trade. A 2010 Australian Strategic Policy Institute report stated that \\"Defence‚Äôs principal needs from Australian industry are maintenance, repair and upgrading of the ADF‚Äôs equipment, most of which is imported\\". This report also noted that at the time it was estimated that manufacturing represented 20 percent of the Australian defence industry's revenue, with sustainment services making up the remainder. In 2018 the Australian Government announced a plan to support the Australian defence industry to expand its exports, with the goal of Australia becoming the 10th largest source of military exports. This will include making $A3.8 billion in government funding available for loans to companies and establishing an Australian Defence Export Advocate.

Early life and education William Rangeley, who was the son of two early Northern Rhodesia pioneers, Henry Rangeley and Florence (n√©e van Breda), was born at Fort Jameson, (now Chipata, Zambia), in what was then Northern Rhodesia, on 2 July 1909. He attended a school in Plumtree in Southern Rhodesia, and then the Diocesan College at Rondebosch, a suburb of Cape Town, in South Africa. He attended Rhodes University in Grahamstown and, under a Rhodes Scholarship he studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, from which he subsequently received a diploma in Anthropology following study during an extended leave.Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411.Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, p. 7. Administrative career After his scholarship at Oxford University ended, he was appointed to the colonial administration of Nyasaland in 1934. He served in many districts and became District Commissioner successively in Nkhotakota District in the Central Province and Mzimba District in the Northern Province. He was promoted to become the Provincial Commissioner for the Southern Province in 1952. He retained his post as Provincial Commissioner until his death in 1958.Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411.Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, p. 7. Between 1892 and 1904, district officers with the official title of Collectors of Revenue, later that of Resident, were appointed by the Commissioner and Consul-General of the protectorate. From 1904, the Colonial Office assumed responsibility for appointments, but before the First World War these officials included ex-soldiers and ex-missionary employees whose African experience was their main qualification for the post.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 70-1. After the First World War, the preferred candidates were from the British upper middle class, educated in British public schools and, if possible, universities. By the 1930s, most new district officers were graduates; the Colonial Office preferred those from Oxford or Cambridge but graduates of these elite universities usually chose colonies such as Kenya or Southern Rhodesia. Rangeley did not have the usual background of district officers of that time, and he was described as ‚Äúrough- hewn‚Äù, but his Rhodes Scholarship to Cambridge made him a suitable candidate.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, p. 217. In 1933, Indirect rule was introduced into Nyasaland, and customary law needed to be understood by what were now called District Commissioners, who had to ensure that local customary law was being correctly applied by each Native Authority in their districts. Up to this point, the customary law of African societies had been evolving in response to rapid changes within themselves, and in colonial society generally, but the colonial administration wanted laws that were codified and consistent with English law, which involved rejecting Trial by ordeal or the recognition of domestic slavery. Rangeley was particularly well equipped for this task through his anthropological training and meticulous recording of information, and also his childhood in an area where the Chewa language, also used in central Nyasaland, was spoken.B Pachai (2000), 'Notes on Cewa Tribal Law' by Rangeley, pp. 7-8 The first stadium built in Blantyre was named the Rangeley Stadium after him, but renamed the Kamuzu Stadium after the first president of the independent Malawi, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda.Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411. Research interests Rangeley joined the Nyasaland Society, now the Society of Malawi, Historical and Scientific, in 1948 and produced a detailed anthropological study of the Chewa people in the first volume of The Nyasaland Journal. As a trained anthropologist, Rangeley was able to carry out original research into the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of Nyasaland living in the areas where his successive appointments took him and he produced around a dozen articles for the Nyasaland Journal before his death. Two articles published in 1959 and 1960 were completed before his death and six published between 1962 and 1964 were chapters of a proposed comprehensive history of Nyasaland.

It connected the Midland Railway main line at Kettering to ironstone deposits to the south-east of the town, as well as opening up the agricultural district around Thrapston and reaching the regional centre of Huntingdon. The hoped-for expansion of agricultural was limited and local traffic did not develop; at the same time the difficult alignment and gradients of the line discouraged heavy use as a through line. A basic passenger service operated through from Kettering to Cambridge, by using running powers east of Huntingdon via St Ives. Although some munitions traffic during World War II enhanced the value of the line temporarily, it declined steeply after 1945 and passenger services were withdrawn in 1959. When the iron ore workings diminished too, the line was cut back in 1963 to serve only the remaining Twywell site. That activity too finished in 1971, resulting in total closure. First railways The Kettering, Thrapston and Huntingdon RailwayThe route of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) between London and Peterborough via Huntingdon was completed in 1850. Later part of the Midland Railway main line came into use in 1857, between Hitchin and Leicester. For the time being the Midland Railway trains used the GNR's Kings Cross station in London.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, Huntingdon had been approached from the east by the Lynn and Ely Railway, which projected an extension of its line from Ely to St Ives, and this was opened on 17 August 1847. It was worked at first by the Eastern Counties Railway; in 1862, the Great Eastern Railway took over.Vic Mitchell, Keith Smith, Christopher Awdry and Allan Mott Branch Lines Around Huntingdon: Kettering to Cambridge, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1991, During the construction of the Midland Railway line it was evident that there were commercially valuable ironstone deposits in the area around Kettering. An earlier scheme to connect them had failed, but in 1860 a definite proposal was formulated to reach them and to continue to Huntingdon on the Great Northern line. The first part was authorised as the Kettering and Thrapstone (sic) Railway, which received its authorising Act on 29 July 1862; the Parliamentary process was more easy than was often the case at this period.Peter Butler, A History of the Railways of Northamptonshire, Silver Link Publishing Ltd, 2006, The line was to terminate at Thrapston adjacent to the London and North Western Railway station on the western edge of the town.John Slack, The Arrival of the Midland Railway at Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire, in 1866, Landmark Publishing Ltd, 2001, Geoffrey Kingscott, Lost Railways of Northamptonshire, Countryside Books, Newbury, 2008, A newspaper reported: > Kettering and Thrapston Railway Bill: This bill has just received the Royal > assent, and we understand the works are to be commenced immediately. There > are extensive quarries of iron stone of a fine quality, and also beds of > white clay, which will be worked in the vicinity, and for which there is a > great and increasing demand. A bill will be brought in in the next session > of Parliament to extend the powers of the act to Huntingdon, so as to > connect the Eastern Counties with the Midland line.Leicester Mercury, 9 > August 1862 Extending to Huntingdon Thrapston railway viaduct, still extant (2018); it replaced an earlier timber structureAs the newspaper indicated, plans were afoot for the Huntingdon extension, and again the Bill met little opposition: the Kettering, Thrapstone and Huntingdon Railway was authorised on 28 July 1863. The Midland Railway was authorised to work the line for 40% of the gross receipts for the first seven years, and at 50% thereafter. The engineer was James Brunlees. The Board of Trade inspector approved the line between Kettering and Huntingdon on 15 February 1866, and the first goods train ran on 21 February 1866, followed by passenger trains from 1 March 1866. It was worked by the Midland Railway from the outset, and there were running powers over the Great Eastern Railway from Huntingdon to Cambridge via St Ives.D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1977, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The line had sharp curves and difficult gradients, and running through sparsely populated terrain, many of the stations were not well situated for the communities they were intended to serve. The Cambridge newspaper reported: > The Huntingdon, Thrapston, and Kettering Railway: This railway was opened > Thursday, the 1st inst., [1 March 1866] for passenger traffic, the Midland > Company running four trains each way between Cambridge and Kettering, and > two each way on Sundays. The distance between Kettering and Cambridge is > miles, and between the former place and Huntingdon miles. The stations > between Kettering and Huntingdon are Brampton, Grafham, Kimbolton, Raunds, > Thrapston, Twywell, and Crawford. The journey to Cambridge is done by the > Midland trains running over the Great Eastern from Huntingdon. The goods > traffic commenced last week. This line will now offer facilities for > communication with the Midland and North-Western Railways.Cambridge > Independent Press: 3 March 1866 In operation There were never more than four passenger trains daily running throughout on the line, although there were some short working to Thrapston, and on summer Saturdays in the 1950s a through Leicester to Clacton-on-Sea service operated. The company was vested in the Midland Railway on 6 August 1897. After the 1923 Grouping, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) took control of the line; the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) controlled the main line at Huntingdon and eastwards. Soon the ironstone at the western end of the line became exhausted, and this, together with the increase in motor transport, caused a decline in the line's importance. There was a possibility of the line closing in the late 1930s but the demands of wartime transport during World War II kept the line in operation; a United States Air Force base was established at Stow Longa, which resulted in increased munitions traffic for the time being. Twywell closed in 1951 and Cranford five years later. A business study was carried out on the route between Kettering and Huntingdon in 1958; it showed considerable losses, and the result was that the passenger service was withdrawn after 15 June 1959. At the same time the line west of Kimbolton was closed completely. This was further cut back from 18 October 1963 when only the line from Kettering to Twywell remained open; there were extensive iron workings at Twywell. At the Kettering end of the line, crew-training was undertaken in August 1962. After the severe winter of 1962-63, a bridge near Raunds collapsed, and it was announced that all traffic would cease from 28 October 1963, except the Twywell ore trains. These continued until 27 July 1971. There is now no railway activity on the former line.

The regiment traces its origins back to the militia cavalry units raised in the colony of South Australia, specifically the South Australian Mounted Rifles.  History  The 23rd Light Horse was formed in the 1912 reorganisation of the Australian Light Horse, following the Kitchener Review. As a result of this reorganisation, additional Light Horse Brigades and regiments were to be raised, resulting in a third regiment being raised in the South Australia. The 23rd was a new regiment which incorporated elements of the 16th Australian Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles) and the 17th Australian Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles). It comprised * Headquarters and Signallers (formerly 17th Light Horse) Adelaide * Machine Gun Section (17th Light Horse) Adelaide * A Squadron (formerly No 1 Squadron, 16th Light Horse, 1st Squadron) located at Adelaide ‚Äì Magill ‚Äì Tea Tree Gully ‚Äì Ashton ‚Äì Lobethal ‚Äì Gumeracha ‚Äì Blumberg * B Squadron located at North Adelaide ‚Äì Walkerville ‚Äì Prospect ‚Äì Salisbury ‚Äì Two Wells ‚Äì Smithfield ‚Äì Angle Vale ‚Äì Gawler ‚Äì Williamstown * C Squadron located at Burra ‚Äì Hamley Bridge ‚Äì Riverton ‚Äì Kapunda In 1913 it adopted the territorial title of 23rd (Barossa) Light Horse in recognition of its major catchment area of the Barossa north of Adelaide. During the First World War militia units were precluded from serving oversees, as a result of the Defence Act 1903; however, members of the 23rd volunteered for service with the Australian Imperial Force. In recognition of this service, the 23rd Light Horse was later awarded battle honours for ANZAC, Gallipoli, Egypt and the Sinai. Following the war the Australian Light Horse was again reorganised in 1921 and the 23rd formed part of the 6th Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division. This brigade also contained the 3rd and 9th Light Horse Regiments as well as supporting troops. During the 1920s the Australian Light Horse converted from their pre-war mounted rifles role to that of cavalry modelled along British Army lines. Due to the financial pressures that the Australian military was under, a number of light horse units were amalgamated in the late 1920s. The 18th and 23rd Light Horse Regiments were linked to form the 18th/23rd Light Horse Regiment in 1929. In 1936, the 18th and 23rd were unlinked; however, the 23rd was linked with the 9th Light Horse Regiment to form the 9th/23rd Light Horse Regiment. When the Second World War broke out the CMF was mobilised for continuous training and home defence. During the early period of the war the unit conducted training with its parent division and many members volunteered to join the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. The 23rd was unlinked from the 9th on 1 December 1941. As part of the wider mechanisation of the Australian Light Horse, the unit was converted to a mechanised reconnaissance role and was retitled the 23rd Reconnaissance Company (Barossa Light Horse) at this time. The Reconnaissance Company comprised * Company Headquarters (58 personnel and 12 vehicles) * Mortar Platoon comprising a headquarters and two mortar sections (21 personnel and 2 motorcycles, 4 x 15 cwt trucks and 2 x 3inch mortars) *Infantry Platoon comprising a headquarters and four infantry sections (41 personnel and 6 x 15cwt trucks) * Three Scout Platoons comprising a headquarters, armoured reconnaissance section and two carrier sections (39 personnel, 2 motorcycles, 5 reconnaissance cars and 7 tracked carriers) In this role it was to serve as the reconnaissance force for the 4th Military District till March 1942. From this time it served as the brigade reconnaissance squadron for the 6th Motor Brigade, which had begun the process of motorisation in February. However, when the 6th Motor Brigade was earmarked for conversion to an Armoured Brigade, the 9th Motor Regiment was designated its reconnaissance squadron. Consequently, this left 23rd Reconnaissance Company surplus to requirement and it was disbanded on 8 May 1942 without serving overseas.

Retrieved January 29th, 2018. A substantial part of Oreopoulos' research deals with the consequences of changes in compulsory schooling laws, especially in the United Kingdom, which provide an exogenous variation of education. In this context, among else, he found * that the benefits of compulsory schooling are very large - 10-15% higher annual earnings per additional year of high school - independent of whether they affect the majority or only a minority of those subject to it;Oreopoulos, P. (2006). Estimating Average and Local Average Treatment Effects of Education When Compulsory Schooling Laws Really Matter. American Economic Review, 96(1), pp. 152-175. * that adolescents drop out of school rather because they ignore or heavily discount future consequences of dropping out than because of an aversion against high school, which implies that making school compulsory or offering incentives for students to stay in school may help substantially improve lifetime outcomes;Oreopoulos, P. (2007). Do dropouts drop out too soon? Wealth, health and happiness from compulsory schooling. Journal of Public Economics, 91(11-12), pp. 2213-2229. * that, in both the U.S. and the UK, educated people are generally more interested and involved in politics, but that - unlike in the UK - less educated US Americans are also less likely to vote than highly educated US Americans, with registration rules being the likely culprit by raising barriers for voting that may be excessively high for uneducated individuals (with Kevin Milligan and Enrico Moretti);Milligan, K., Moretti, E., Oreopoulos, P. (2004). Does education improve citizenship? Evidence from the United States and the United Kingdom. Journal of Public Economics, 88(9-10), pp. 1667-1695. * and that a 1-year increase in the education of either parent reduces the likelihood that a child repeats a grade by 2-4% in the U.S., thus reducing intergenerational social mobility (with Marianne E. Page).Oreopoulos, P., Page, M.E. (2006). The Intergenerational Effects of Compulsory Schooling. Journal of Labor Economics, 24(4), pp. 729-760. Other findings of Oreopoulos include (i) that workers who graduated from college during recessions suffer from persistently lower earnings for up to a decade, beginning their careers working for lower paying employers and then gradually upgrading their jobs by moving to better firms, with the speed of the upgrading determined by graduates' socioeconomic backgrounds (with Till von Wachter and Andrew Heisz);Oreopoulos, P., von Wachter, T., Heisz, A. (2012). The Short- and Long-Term Career Effects of Graduating in a Recession. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 4(1), pp. 1-29. (ii) that the non-financial benefits of schooling - e.g. higher work enjoyment, patience, trust, ambition, and risk aversion or also better decisions regarding health, marriage or parenting - are at least as large as the financial benefits of schooling and would - ironically - benefit school dropouts most (with Kjell Salvanes);Oreopoulos, P., Salvanes, K. (2011). Priceless: The Nonpecuniary Benefits of Schooling. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25(1), pp. 159-184. (iii) that the quality of neighborhoods in which children grow up in has only a very small impact in determining their adult earnings, likelihood of unemployment, or dependence on welfare benefits, but that the quality of the children's family environment does;Oreopoulos, P. (2003). The Long-Run Consequences of Living in a Poor Neighborhood. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118(4), pp. 1533-1575. and (iv) that poor infant health predicts both mortality within one year, and mortality up to age 17, as well as long-term educational and labour force outcomes such as high school completion and welfare takeup.Oreopoulos, P. et al. (2008). Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Consequences of Poor Infant Health: An Analysis Using Siblings and Twins. Journal of Human Resources, 43(1), pp. 88-138. More recently and in line with his work at J-PAL, Philip Oreopoulos has used randomized controlled trials to investigate issues in education, e.g. finding that combining academic support services and financial incentives for good grades may be particularly effective in improving the grades and long-term study skills of female freshmen but will have no effect on men, in part because of poor male take- up,Angrist, J., Lang, D., Oreopoulos, P. (2009). Incentives and Services for College Achievement: Evidence from a Randomized Trial. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(1), pp. 136-163. or that combining the offer of assistance with completing the college financial aid applications with information about aid estimates may be effective in substantially increasing the likelihood of college attendance, persistence and aid receipt for low- income individuals whereas simply providing information isn't.Bettinger, E.P. et al.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twelve small, green to brownish green, and reddish flowers. It usually grows in heath in rocky places near the coast. Description Genoplesium brachystachyum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin green leaf with a reddish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between three and twelve green to brownish green flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers lean downwards and are about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is reddish, about long and wide with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and have a small white gland on the tip. The petals are about long, wide and reddish with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The labellum is reddish, narrow elliptic in shape, about long, wide, with irregular edges and a sharply pointed tip. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from February to April. Taxonomy and naming The Rocky Cape orchid was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley who gave it the name Prasophyllum brachystachyum from a specimen collected near Rocky Cape. The description was published in Lindley's book, The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium brachystachyum and in 2002 changed the name again to Corunastylis brachystachya. The specific epithet (brachystachyum) in derived from the Ancient Greek words brachys meaning \\"short\\" and stachys meaning \\"an ear of grain\\" or \\"a spike\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium brachystachyum grows in heath and heathy forest, among low shrubs, boulders and rock plates. It is found in disjunct populations containing fewer than 25 individuals near the north and west coasts. Conservation The total population of G. brachystachyum is estimated to be less than 250. The main threats to the species are land clearing, inappropriate fire regimes and inappropriate disturbances such as roadworks. The species (as Corunastylis brachystachya) is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act.

The house on the pier will be restored and become a new visitor gateway to the western part of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, later known as Lim Chu Kang Nature Park. History The Lim Chu Kang area in Singapore, was once made up of mangroves rain forests and rubber plantations belonged to Namazie and Cashin Estates. A pier was built in 1906 by Henry Cashin, an Irish merchant, for his rubber estate. Henry Cashin's grandson, Joseph Cashin, would built a house on the pier some time from 1920 to 1921, hence the name The Pier. The Pier was also one of the sites where the Japanese Imperial Army first landed on the north- western coastline on 8 February 1942, catching the defending 22nd Brigade Australian soldiers by surprise. The battle was fought over the night between the Japanese Imperial Army and Australian soldiers, which saw some 360 Australian soldiers killed despite having inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese soldiers. Once Kranji and Lim Chu Kang fell during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, the Japanese went on to erect a war shrine at the site. The house was used by Japanese Imperial Army officers as a 'comfort' stop until 1945. In the 1960s, before the rubber plantation owner and lawyer Howard Edmund Cashin (1920‚Äì2009) and his wife Gillian moved into the house, he had the war shrine removed and constructed the road to the house. According to Howard Cashin in the interview, the Japanese war shrine was something that he had difficulty removing after the war as it was not easy to find workmen willing to demolish the shrine during that time, as the stone from the pedestal of the shrine had stood on was used to construct the road to the house that he wanted to add on. The house was extended and redesigned, its interior was redesigned with a modern touch, with ceiling fans, aircon and other facilities powered by electricity. Barbeque pit and stone tables were the later additions on the landed compound near The Pier.https://remembersingapore.org/lim-chu-kang-pier/ Howard Cashin and his family would lived at The Pier occasionally as their weekend resort until his death on 5 September 2009.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes20090905-1 Redevelopment The house has since vacated and its compound was acquired and fenced up by the Singapore Land Authority.

It is in the same family as the Tangos, but slower and with different topics, lyrics and mood. Every Tientos becomes a Tangos at the end of the song/dance. Traditionally, cantaor El Marrurro (1848 -1906) has been considered one of the creators of this style. Enrique el Mellizo gave it the modern form by which we know it today. Other famous cantaores who interpreted this style were Antonio Chac√≥n and Pastora Pav√≥n. Like many Cante Jondo, traditional Tientos lyrics (letras) tend to be pathetic, sentimental, and speak about the lack of love, disillusionment and revenge. Dancers strive to capture this mood in their solos. It can be danced by a man or a woman.  Structure  The structure is similar to most Flamenco dances and can be broken down as follows: * Guitar intro * Song intro * Footwork intro and llamada * First letra, punctuated by a footwork during the respiro ‚Äë a break in the song after the second line of letra * Guitar falsetta * Escobilla (footwork section) * Second letra * Second escobilla * Subida * Macho or Tangos to close  Comp√°s  The comp√°s of Tientos has a 4/4 time signature like the Tangos, but with the above 2 ways of accents.

In 1892, at the age of 19, she struck out on her own, first to Chester County, Pennsylvania, where she completed her education and taught primary school, and then on to Philadelphia, where in 1900 she enrolled in the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art. She won several awards for her designs and illustrations and was awarded a scholarship. In 1902, M. Louise Baker secured a job from C.B. Moore, restoring pottery and drawing illustrations for his popular \\"oversized, well-illustrated volumes\\" published by the Academy of Natural Sciences. See, for example, , which includes a discussion of Moore's working relationship with Baker and a reprint of H. Newell Wardle's \\"Clarence Bloomfield Moore (1852-1936),\\" originally printed in the Bulletin of the Philadelphia Anthropological Society (vol. 9, no. 2, March 1956) In 1903, she obtained a teaching position at the George School, a Quaker boarding school near Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In 1908, she was hired as a part- time illustrator by the archaeologist George Byron Gordon, then the General Curator of American Archaeology, at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, where she worked as the Museum Artist until 1936. She worked as an archaeological illustrator, did illustrations for Museum publications and exhibits, restoration work, and also made models and replicas. Baker wrote and illustrated stories and poems for children throughout her career, and published illustrations in the Children's Page of the Youth's Companion Magazine and other magazines for children. Baker also led groups of women on summer tours of European museums. During the First World War, between 1919 and 1920, Baker served with the American Friends Service Committee in France, where she ran an Embroidery Depot for refugees at Verdun and Clermont-en-Argonne, in northeast France near the Belgian border. In August, 1920, she returned to Philadelphia with E. Constance Allen, of Dublin, Ireland. The two had a lifelong relationship and worked together at the George School. Major illustrations and travel M. Louise Baker undertook her first work for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in 1908 on the Museum's Nubian pottery collection. This work was at the request of David Randall-MacIver, who was then the director of the Museum's Nubian expedition. She earned $80 a month. These illustrations were subsequently published in Leonard Woolley and David Randall-MacIver's reports on Karanog, Karan√¥g: the Romano-Nubian cemetery (1910) and Buhen (1911). Baker's work at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology attracted wider notice, leading many \\"other ... archaeologists, who had only seen examples of her published work, [to] request... her participation in future efforts.\\" Baker worked in pen and ink, charcoal and watercolor.

Louise Baker traveled to New Orleans, where she painted Maya material at Tulane University's Middle American Research Institute. Next she traveled to M√©rida, Yucat√°n, in Mexico, and painted and drew Maya pottery in the State Museum and private collections. Next she traveled to Guatemala City, Guatemala, to make ink and watercolor illustrations of pots from the Carnegie Institution of Washington expedition to Uaxactun and from Cob√°n, held in the private collection of Erwin Paul Dieseldorff. Her paintings and illustrations of Maya pottery were subsequently published by the University of Pennsylvania Museum between 1925 and 1943 in several volumes of Examples of Maya Pottery in the Museum and Other Collections; several others appeared in the second volume of E.P.

Leonard Woolley served as the excavation director for the Expedition, which uncovered the Royal Tombs of Ur. During her return from Iraq, Baker visited museums and private collections in Germany, Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and England to add to her illustrations of Maya ceramics. Later life and death M. Louise Baker left the Penn Museum in 1936 when, owing to her failing eyesight, she had difficulty producing illustrations. She retired from the George School two years later, in 1939, together with E. Constance Allen, who was dean there from 1925 to 1938. Baker and Allen purchased a home together in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. For the next ten years, Baker taught classes on writing and illustration, carpentry, furniture making, metal working, and ceramics. She also gave talks on local and Quaker history and her archaeological adventures, acted in amateur theater productions in Chester County, and led tours to European museums. Baker suffered eye problems ranging from cataracts to glaucoma throughout her life. Doctors hit upon the idea of applying leeches to her temples to alleviate her symptoms. She was completely blind by 1949. Baker and E. Constance Allen spent their final years together at The Hickman, a Quaker retirement home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. M.

It starts in Chacewater. Trewedna Water and River Kennall flow into the Carnon before it merges with Tallack's Creek to become Restronguet Creek, which eventually flows into the English Channel at the mouth of Carrick Roads. The Nebra sky disc, a gold-decorated bronze disc found in Germany and dated to the Bronze Age, contains both gold and tin from the Carnon valley. In 1992 the river was hit by a major pollution incident, when over 45 million litres of contaminated water from the closed Wheal Jane mine was released by the collapse of an adit, colouring the river water red. A treatment works has since been installed at Wheal Jane to intercept the contaminated water and treat it to remove suspended metals and restore a neutral pH.

In Spanish, it is known as . It has often been confused with Euphorbia lamarckii. Description Euphorbia regis-jubae is a shrub, up to tall. It has light brown stems and terminal rosettes of leaves that are narrow and oblong, with a pointed or somewhat blunt apex. The inflorescences are pedunculate, umbel-like, usually simple with five to eight rays, more rarely compound. The greenish-yellow floral bracts are large, not joined at the base, and persist when the fruit has formed. The fruit capsules are light brown or red. The seeds have a stalked elaiosome (caruncle). File:Teguise - Camino de Teguise al las Nieves - Euphorbia regis-jubae 04 ies.jpgInflorescence File:Euphorbia regis-jubae √† Lanzarote infructescence.JPGFruit Taxonomy Euphorbia regis-jubae was first described by Jaques √âtienne Gay in 1847. It has been treated as a subspecies of other Canary Island euphorbias under the names E. obtusifolia subsp. regis- jubae and E. lamarckii subsp. regis-jubae. E. regis-jubae has regularly been misidentified. The illegitimate name Euphorbia obtusifolia has been used \\"indiscriminately\\" for two species found in the Canary Islands: the eastern E. regis-jubae, and the western E. lamarckii. In 2003, David Bramwell listed seven publications from 1847 to 1993 that gave the wrong names or the wrong distributions for these two species. Distribution Euphorbia regis-jubae is native to the eastern Canary Islands ‚Äì Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, western Morocco and north-western Western Sahara. Its distribution differs from that of E. lamarckii, with which it has often been confused; E. lamarckii is found in the western Canary Islands ‚Äì Tenerife, north-western La Gomera, La Palma and El Hierro.

From 1956 onwards, when Desmond Geoghegan became editor, Ambix began to extend its readership and its period of historical coverage to the time of John Dalton and the nineteenth century. The Society altered its name to the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry in 1975.  Publications  thumb The Society‚Äôs journal Ambix is published four times a year in February, May, August, and November. Papers are refereed by an international editorial board. Its coverage is wide and varied, ranging from studies in exoteric and esoteric alchemy to recent chemistry. Recently, more attention has been given to the history of alchemy, while Ambix continues to provide important reading for historians of chemistry.Sturchio, ISIS, 302. The presentation of scientific ideas, methods and discoveries is made as non-technical as possible, consistent with academic rigour and scientific accuracy. Extensive book reviews are published in each issue of Ambix. Recent special issues include: New Studies on Humphry Davy (May and August 2019); The Royal Typographer and the Alchemist: Willem Silvius and John Dee (May 2017); From the Library to the Laboratory and Back Again (May 2016); and Chemical Knowledge in Transit (November 2015). In May 2013, 2014, and 2015 three special issues were published on Sites of Chemistry devoted to the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries respectively, while the November 2014 special issue concerned Analysis and Synthesis in Medieval and Early Modern Europe. In 2013, the Society launched the series Sources of Alchemy and Chemistry, which provides readers with critical editions and English translations of foundational texts in the history of alchemy and early chemistry. The readership of Ambix is international and includes historians, chemists, philosophers, and scholars in other disciplines. Issues of Ambix are sent to members and libraries around the world and are also available online free to members through the Society‚Äôs website ambix.org. The Society publishes its newsletter Chemical Intelligence twice a year. This publication advertises and reports not only the Society‚Äôs events and activities, but also those of other organisations involved in the history of alchemy and chemistry. Chemical Intelligence is distributed to members by email and is made available free to the public online via www.ambix.org. The Society's archive is kept at the History of Science Museum, Oxford.  Meetings  The Society generally organises a Spring meeting and an Autumn meeting each year. Recent topics included John Dee and Print Culture; Chemistry and its Audiences; Making Chemistry: History, Materials, and Practices; New and Old Themes in the History of Chemistry and Chemistry in Europe. The Society also organises annual postgraduate workshops usually held in the Autumn. Workshops have been held at Cambridge, London, Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Philadelphia.  Prizes and Grants  The Society offers three prizes: the Partington Prize, awarded every three years for an original essay by a new scholar on any aspect of the history of alchemy and chemistry; the John and Martha Morris Award, which is also made every three years, for outstanding achievements in the history of modern chemistry or the history of the chemical industry; and the Oxford Part II Prize, which can be awarded in any year for an excellent history of chemistry thesis submitted for a Chemistry Part II at Oxford University. The Society further offers yearly grants, for which members of the Society may apply. The Society offers two types of competitive grants, both part of its Award Scheme.

In the 14th century, ƒÄstƒÅrƒÅ became the seat of the principality.  History  According to Minorsky, no detailed record seems to be extant of a principality which for a long time existed on the territory between Gilan and M≈´qƒÅn (M≈´ghƒÅn) and whose rulers had the title of ispahbad or sipahbad. According to Ibn KhurdƒÅdhbih (who wrote not later than in 885) M≈´qƒÅn belonged to Shekla. Towards 936, the isfahbadh of M≈´qƒÅn, Ibn-Dal≈´la, sided with a rebel chief of Gilan, Lashkarƒ´ ibn-Mardƒ´, and opposed the Kurdish ruler of Azarbayjan, Daysam ibn-IbrƒÅhƒ´m. His headquarters seem to have been on the northern bank of the Araxes and we cannot say whether he was of the same family as the later sipahbads of Gilan, whose activities centered more to the south, in TƒÅlish. The late A. Kasravi discovered in the dƒ´vƒÅn of the poet Qatran a curious ode on an expedition which the RawƒÅdƒ´ ruler of Tabriz, Vahs≈´dƒÅn (circa 1025-59) sent to Ardabil, under the leadership of his son Mamlan. As a result, a fortress was built in Ardabil and the sipahbad of M≈´qƒÅn had to submit to the conqueror. As of Gilan, Mustawfƒ´ mentions the little town of I·π£fahbad, which YƒÅ·∏≥≈´t spells IsfahbudhƒÅn, adding that stood two miles distant from the coast of the Caspian, but nor otherwise indicating its position; corn, rice, and a little fruit were grown here, ind in neighboring district were near a hundred villages. The name of the township came from the I·π£fahbads. alt= In later Seljuk times we hear of ¬´Nusrat al-dƒ´n Abul-Muzaffar Ispahbad KiyƒÅ LivƒÅshƒ´r¬ª, to whom Khaqanƒ´ dedicated several poems in which he praised his liberality and mourned his untimely demise. In a threnody written after his death, he says farewell to ShandƒÅn and ArchavƒÅn, of which the former is an ancient fortress (north of the Astara river) and the latter a village lying some 7‚Äì8 km. to the N.W. of AstƒÅrƒÅ.This may have been only a splinter of the ancient territory of the sipahbads, but the fact is that in it they survived even in the days of the Mongol Ilkhans. The History of UljƒÅyt≈´, quoting the description of Gilan by one Asil al-din Muhammad Zauzanƒ´ (at the time of the arrival of Hulagu, circa 1256), also names ShandƒÅn as the capital of the sipahbads.: \\"mustaqarr-i sarƒ´r-i mamlakat-i sipahbad\\" According to the Safvat, when Safi al-din was inquiring in Fars about the whereabouts of Shaykh ZƒÅhid, he was told that the latter lived in the part of Gilan belonging to the Ispahbad (Gƒ´lƒÅn-i Ispahbad). It further tells how Shaykh ZƒÅhid interceded in favour of Malik Ahmad Isbahbad of Gilan, when Ghazan fell foul of him and arrested him, and how Malik Ahmad entertained the shaykh. According to HƒÅfiz-i Abr≈´, at the time of UljƒÅyt≈´'s campaign in Gilan (1307), the Sipahbad's name was Rukn al-din Ahmad and he served as a guide to the troops of Amir Chopan. Consequently, it becomes probable that the Malik Ahmad mentioned in Abu-Sa'ƒ´d's decree (Melig Aqmad) as having given the three villages (Kenleƒçe, Sidil, and Aradi) to Badr al-dƒ´n Mahm≈´d was the same local ruler.: \\"W. B. Henning seeks the three villages granted to Badr al-dƒ´n Mahm≈´d in the basin of the Vƒ´lƒÅ≈æ-r≈´d in the northern part of TƒÅlish, and in fact the name Aradi sounds very much like the present-day Arat Such a hypothesis would lead us to admit that the sipahbad's writ went so far north as the Vƒ´lƒÅ≈æ-r≈´d, which, at present, forms the northern frontier of the TƒÅlishƒ´-speaking population with their prevailing neighbours, the Azarbayjan Turks. The local toponymy suggests that the Iranian Talishƒ´ dialect originally spread considerably further north and, if the sipahbad was actually the ruler of the TƒÅlish people, nothing stands in the way of his making assignments of lands on the Vƒ´lƒÅ≈æ-r≈´d and the outskirts of the M≈´qƒÅn steppe.\\" QƒÅsim al-anvƒÅr who lived in 1356‚Äì1433 and was closely connected with the Safavid family, tells in one of his poems a story about the sipahbad of Gilan JalƒÅl al-dƒ´n H≈´sayn whose throne (takht) was in AstƒÅrƒÅ.  Decline  According to Minorsky, we do not know whether the later governors of Astara still continued the line of the ispahbads. Even after the conquest of Northern TƒÅlish by the Russians (1813) the family of the TƒÅlish-khans maintained some special rights but the degree of its connexion with the ancient sipahbads would require painstaking investigation.

Kravchenko became a Red Army officer during the Interwar period, and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions during the Winter War, which included taking command of his battalion after his battalion commander was killed. He studied at the Frunze Military Academy after the Winter War, and after Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941 was appointed commander of a regiment. After the Soviet defeat in Operation Typhoon he took command of a sector of the defense of Tula before becoming a deputy division commander. Kravchenko was demoted to command of a regiment in early 1942 then appointed commander of the 324th Rifle Division. In April 1942, during the Rzhev‚ÄìVyazma Offensive, he died of wounds received while leading his troops.  Early life and interwar military service  Kravchenko was born on 10 October 1905 in the village of Studeniki, Poltava Governorate. He graduated from fifth grade at the village school in 1919, working as a postman. In October 1927, he was drafted into the Red Army, becoming a cadet in the regimental school of the 138th Pereyaslavl Rifle Regiment of the 46th Rifle Division (a unit stationed in his home area as part of the Ukrainian Military District). After graduating from the regimental school in October 1928, he became a junior commander in the regiment. From October 1930 he studied at the Kiev Infantry School, and after his graduation in September 1931 Kravchenko returned to the 46th Division as commander of a rifle platoon in its 137th Rifle Regiment. He graduated from the Vystrel courses in 1933 and subsequently served as commander of a training platoon, and commander and political officer of a company. In May 1937, Kravchenko was transferred to command a company in the division's 136th Rifle Regiment. From March 1938 he served as chief of food supply for the 289th Rifle Regiment of the 97th Rifle Division, also stationed in the Kiev Military District. In November of that year Kravchenko became assistant commander and acting commander of a rifle battalion in the division's 69th Rifle Regiment. In this position he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland.  Winter War  In December 1939, Kravchenko, then a captain, was sent to the Northwestern Front, fighting in the Winter War against Finland. He became a company commander in the 245th Rifle Regiment of the 123rd Rifle Division, part of the 50th Rifle Corps of the 7th Army. Kravchenko fought in battles to break through the Mannerheim Line on the Karelian Isthmus. On 11 February 1940, after his battalion commander was killed, Kravchenko took command of the unit and led it in the breakthrough of the Hill 65.5 fortifications in the sectors of Muolaanj√§rvi and Karhula. In this action, his battalion was credited in Soviet accounts with capturing five pillboxes, seven bunkers, four anti-tank guns, two depots, as well as killing multiple Finnish soldiers. Kravchenko was seriously wounded in the fighting. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 21 March in recognition of his actions.  World War II  After leaving the hospital on 9 May, Kravchenko took command of the 245th Rifle Regiment. A month later, he was sent to study at the Frunze Military Academy, but only completed a short-term course due to the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941. On 25 July he was appointed commander of the 956th Rifle Regiment in the 299th Rifle Division, forming in the Orel Military District. By this time Kravchenko had been promoted to the rank of Major. At the end of August, the division joined the 50th Army of the Bryansk Front, fighting in defensive battles on the Desna River. In early October, the division was caught up in Operation Typhoon, the opening German attack of the Battle of Moscow, and fought in heavy fighting near Belyov and Bolkhov on the western bank of the Oka River. The 299th and the rest of the army were defeated and surrounded by the German attack, and retreated towards Tula. On 29 October Kravchenko was appointed commander of the Southern Military Sector of the Tula defenses. He was one of the organizers of the defense of the city. On 1 November, the sector was disbanded and its troops transferred to the 154th Rifle Division under the command of Major General Yakov Fokanov, with Kravchenko as its deputy commander. As part of the 50th Army the division fought in the defense of Tula, the Tula Offensive and then in the Kaluga Offensive, part of the Soviet winter counteroffensive at Moscow. On 8 January 1942 Kravchenko was demoted to command the Tula Workers' Regiment. On 8 March, after his superiors reconsidered his removal from command, Kravchenko was appointed commander of the 324th Rifle Division of the 16th Army, fighting as part of the Western Front in the Rzhev‚ÄìVyazma Offensive. Its units fought to capture German strongpoints at Kazar, Vyshilovo, Pesochnya, Lutovnya, and Chernyshino in Smolensk Oblast. After crossing the Zhizdra River, the division captured the strongpoint at Klintsy, but was pushed out by a German counterattack. Kravchenko decided to restore the situation, and went forward to the positions of the 1091st Rifle Regiment. While moving from the positions of that unit to a battery of the 887th Artillery Regiment he was seriously wounded and evacuated to a hospital, but died of wounds on 8 April. He was buried in the Donskoye Cemetery in Moscow.  Personal life  Kravchenko married Yefrosinya and had two daughters: Lyubov and Nina. Yefrosinya and Lyubov are buried next to him, while Nina lived in Moscow as of 2011.

The flamenco guajira is the adaptation to Melos flamenco of the Cuban point, the peasant point, a genre that brings together a series of songs called Guajiros that are grown in the rural areas of the island of Cuba. A guajira is simply a song for voice and guitar with a series of similar letras. The guajira is traditionally danced. The dancer will often use a large Spanish fan. The fan is twirled and otherwise manipulated throughout the dance, adding an elegant and flirtatious air.  Structure  Like all flamenco palos, the guajira has a clear structure and consists of beginning, middle and end. The guajira usually begins with an introductory section (falseta) by the guitar which is based on the basic guajira harmony. The guitar resolves into the characteristic guajira chord pattern, over which the singer will sing the instantly recognizable salida. The dancer enters during the guitarist's falseta or during the salida.

As part of the treaty provisions of Otto's accession, a Bavarian-staffed volunteer military corps was to be formed to replace the forces maintained there by the Great Powers‚Äîchiefly the French troops of the Morea Expedition‚Äîas well as the remnants of the Greek forces organized during the Greek War of Independence, and provide cadres and training for the new Hellenic Army. Because not enough volunteers could be found in time, regular Bavarian Army troops formed much of the actual corps that arrived with Otto in Greece in early 1833. The Bavarian Army regulars were gradually replaced by volunteers until 1834. These came chiefly from Bavaria, but also included men from diverse nations, and often of non-military background. Most of the Bavarians left by 1837, but many remained behind, dominating the Greek army and the administration. This \\"Bavarocracy\\" (ŒíŒ±œÖŒ±œÅŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±), coupled with the huge expenses involved in maintaining the Bavarians, provoked great resentment among the Greeks, and was one of the chief causes of the 3 September 1843 Revolution. Background King Otto of Greece, by Joseph Karl Stieler Article 14 of the 1832 Treaty of London, where Britain, France, and Russia, agreed on the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece, under the Bavarian prince Otto, stipulated that Otto's father, King Ludwig I of Bavaria, would recruit a force of up to 3,500 soldiers, at the expense of the Greek treasury, to replace the allied troops (i.e., the French expeditionary corps). The latter would remain under the disposition of the King of Greece until the arrival of the Bavarian troops. In Article 15, the King of Bavaria promised to supply Bavarian officers for the establishment of a national army in Greece. The Philhellene professor Friedrich Thiersch and Colonel Carl Wilhelm von Heideck, who had served in Greece under Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias and was now a member of Otto's , reported on the situation in Greece to King Ludwig. Following the assassination of Kapodistrias in 1831, Greece was in near-constant civil war. The regular and irregular military forces organized by Kapodistrias were practically dissolved, but many thousands of their members retained their weapons and lived off the countryside. The Bavarians distrusted the irregular fighters who had fought the civil war, and wanted to avoid being drawn into the local factional struggles. Therefore it was decided early on that Otto's new regime could rely solely on the Bavarian troops, who would enforce the new government's policies. To that end, all Greek military formations, chiefly composed of irregulars, would be disbanded, and Greeks were to be excluded from all senior positions in the administration and the military. Formation and arrival in Greece Troop parade of the Auxiliary Corps in Munich, lithograph by The expeditionary corps was formed following a convention concluded on 1 November 1832 between Karl von Abel, one of the three members of the projected regency for the underage Otto, on behalf of Greece and Philippe de Flad on behalf of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The convention's 27 articles stipulated that the expeditionary corps of 3,500 men would be composed of staff, four infantry battalions, six cavalry companies, four artillery companies, and a technician company. The corps was to be composed of volunteers, but until these could be recruited, regular Bavarian Army troops would be provided; half of the corps were to stay in Greece for two years, and the rest for four; the mission of the Auxiliary Corps was slated to end on 1 January 1837. The costs for the maintenance of the corps were set at 50,000 florins annually, to be covered by the Greek government. Officers and adjutants were to received pay equivalent to one rank above their own. According to the Greek military historian Andreas Kastanis, the treaty contained \\"basic omissions\\" in terms of the corps' recruitment: First, the complete lack of a provision for engineering troops, which were an absolute necessity in war-ravaged and under-developed Greece. Indeed, for most of the 19th century the main occupation of Greek military engineers was building basic infrastructure across the country. Second, no formal requirements were placed for the Bavarian volunteers, and third, no requirements were placed for the Bavarian officers sent to oversee the training and organization of the nascent Hellenic Army. Preparations for Otto's departure were confused, and little headway was made in the recruitment of the Auxiliary Corps before Otto was due to set out for Greece. As a result, King Ludwig was obliged to initially fill its ranks with troops seconded from the Bavarian Army: of the 3,582 men sent to Greece, about half were Bavarian Army regulars and the rest volunteers. The Bavarian Army units formed two combined regiments (one from 1st Battalion/ and 2nd Battalion/, and the other from 1st Battalion/ and 2nd Battalion/), two light cavalry squadrons and eight field guns, under Brigade General Friedrich von Hertling. The Auxiliary Corps set out for embarkation at Trieste, while Otto left Munich on 6 December 1832 for Brindisi. On board the British frigate Madagascar, Otto joined the troop convoy at Corfu, but it took further two weeks of sailing through heavy weather before the fleet of 43 ships arrived at the Greek capital of Nafplion on 30 January 1833. Service in Greece=Arrival of the corps and the Bavarocracy= Soldiers of the 2nd Combined Infantry Regiment, by Richard Kn√∂tel The regency council that led the government during Otto's minority quickly became extremely unpopular. Following King Ludwig's instructions they disregarded Greek demands for a constitution and ruled the country autocratically. Furthermore, in their efforts to quickly transform Greece into a European-style state, the regency did not examine the conditions objectively, but tried to directly import European norms and regulations, which were completely inappropriate for the war-ravaged and destitute country, and completely failed to take into account the sensibilities of the local population. The regency was particularly suspicious of the irregular soldiers who had fought the War of Independence, and failed to either recompense them with the public lands captured from the Turks, as promised, nor to provide them with employ by taking them into the army. This led to them turning to brigandage, both in Greece and across the border into the Ottoman territories. Per the terms of the Greco-Bavarian treaty, the Auxiliary Corps was to be an independent formation, not to be mixed or combined with native Greek units, and subject to Bavarian military law, rather than the French regulations followed in Greece. However, in its efforts to reduce the country to obedience and establish order, as well as to minimize the influence of the Greek factions and Westernize the country as fast as possible, it could only rely on foreign, chiefly Bavarian officials, and on the bayonets of the Bavarian troops. As a result, the separation of the Bavarian and Greek troops was disregarded, and on 6 February 1834 by Royal Decree, the relevant article in the treaty was modified unilaterally, with the Auxiliary Corps becoming a part of the Hellenic Army. Two companies in each infantry battalion, in the cavalry regiment, and the artillery battalion, were to be manned exclusively by Bavarians. While the stated purpose of this arrangement was to promote the training of the Greek units, in reality this was a measure designed to ensure absolute control of the army by the Bavarians. Likewise, all senior military positions were given to Bavarians or other foreigners: Wilhelm von Le Suire became Minister for Military Affairs; Inspector-General of the Army; Anton Z√§ch head of the Engineers; Ludwig von L√ºder head of the Artillery; the French Philhellene head of the Gendarmerie; and the British Philhellene Thomas Gordon chief of the General Staff. The Bavarians, moreover, remained subject to their own military regulations, received higher salaries, and swifter promotions, setting themselves further apart from their Greek colleagues. It is notable that similar measures to concentrate command authority in the hands of foreigners were not undertaken in the navy, which on its own could not challenge the regime. This \\"Bavarocracy\\" (ŒíŒ±œÖŒ±œÅŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±), both in the army and the civil administration, quickly became a source of resentment among the Greeks, and was a major rallying cry of political opposition to the regency, and later to Otto himself. The exorbitant costs of the Auxiliary Corps became a particular point of contention, particularly since by 1834, its strength reached 5,000 men, well above the provisions of the treaty. =Life of the Bavarian troops in Greece= The \\"Lion of the Bavarians\\" at Nafplion, a memorial to the Bavarian Army members who died from typhus in 1833‚Äì1834 Most of the Bavarian Army regulars left Greece after a year, and were replaced by volunteers. Between 1832 and 1835, 5,410 volunteers were recruited for the Corps. 3,345 were Bavarians, 1,440 from minor German states, 235 Swiss, 186 Prussians, 135 Austrians, 23 French, 19 Danes, 10 Russians, 6 Italians, 3 Swedes, 2 British, 1 each from Holland, Spain, and Belgium, and even 3 Turks. Many of these volunteers were disappointed by the realities they found in Greece, which matched neither the romantic expectations current in Europe nor the often excessive promises made by recruiting agents. Service in Greece was unpopular, and considered almost a death sentence: half of the volunteers died in Greece from disease. Bavarian Army personnel, especially officers, sometimes had to be effectively cajoled by their superiors into signing up. Life in Greece also proved to be too expensive for the Bavarians, who were accustomed to comforts alien to the Greeks and unobtainable in Greece except at great cost. Furthermore, the divides of religion and language also meant that few of them were able to find Greek wives. In the Athenian suburb of Iraklio, founded as a Bavarian military colony, the local Catholic pastor had to function as match- maker, bringing in a boatload of Catholic girls from Syros to secure the colony's continued existence. =Maniot uprising of 1834= Bavarian troops attacking a Maniot tower house, watercolor by K√∂llnberger Bavarian lancers charging Greek rebels, watercolor by K√∂llnberger The Corps fought its main test of arms in 1834, being sent to confront an uprising of the Mani Peninsula. The Maniots, a warlike people who had withstood the Ottomans and Egyptians, were incensed when the regency ordered the destruction of the fortified tower houses typical of the area. This was a typical example of Bavarian insensitivity to local peculiarities: where the regency saw in these buildings only a dangerous military asset that might be used to challenge its authority, to the Maniots these were their homes, whose destruction without recompense would leave them destitute. The regency's local agent, the Bavarian officer Maximilian Feder, had managed to maintain order until then through a judicious mixture of bribery and force, but he lost control following the regency's arrest and trial of Theodoros Kolokotronis, one of the principal military leaders of the War of Independence. Kolokotronis' supporters in the region and the regency's political rivals combined in exhorting the Maniots to rise up. 2,500 men of the Corps, under Christian Schmaltz, were sent to suppress the revolt. The Bavarians' unfamiliarity with the climate and terrain, to which the Maniots and their tactics were perfectly adjusted, meant that they could achieve little: in the harsh mountains, the Bavarians were unable to deploy larger formations or even provide effective artillery support, while the Maniots resorted to their time-honoured guerrilla tactics against their lumbering, heat-exhausted opponents. The Bavarians were also completely unprepared for the cruelty of the Maniots: captured soldiers were sometimes put in bags with wild cats, or gradually mutilated. At best, they were stripped of weapons and clothes and sent back naked to their lines. To denote their disdain, when the Maniots agreed to ransom their prisoners to the government, they demanded six phoenixes for each soldier, but only one phoenix for the officers. Unable to make headway, the regency was forced to issue a general amnesty to calm the situation, and negotiate terms: the Maniots were promised subsidies, respect for the privileges of Orthodox monasteries, and non-interference in their affairs. The upshot of the affair was that the government ended up pouring into Mani twice the sums that it received from it in taxes, and that the myth of the Bavarians' invincibility was broken, severely tarnishing the regency's prestige and authority and encouraging future revolts. =Later years and disbandment= By December 1834, of the 5,678 men in the Hellenic Army, 3,278 were members of the Bavarian Auxiliary Corps; a year later, with army strength at 9,613, the Auxiliary Corps men numbered 4,570. This was an enormous burden on the weak Greek finances, especially since this army counted no fewer than 731 officers (533 Greeks, 144 Germans, 54 Philhellenes). In the assessment of the Austrian ambassador, Anton von Prokesch-Osten, \\"the foreign auxiliary troops cost money, without doing much\\", while the \\"insistence on European clothing and armament in the army have removed the most usable people from military service and made them into disgruntled men\\". In January 1836, the army was reorganized, as the decision was taken to gradually form units only from Greeks. Two of the four infantry battalions were now composed of Greeks, and the other two of men of the Auxiliary Corps, with the intention to replace them with Greeks as the Germans' terms of service ended,. Furthermore, two Labourer Companies (ŒõœåœáŒøŒπ ŒïœÅŒ≥Œ±œÑœéŒΩ) were formed from supernumerary German personnel, and employed in road construction in Continental Greece and as border guards. =D√©nouement: the last Bavarian officers= When the Corps' tenure ended in 1837, the bulk of its members left, but the Greek government offered inducements for many to stay on. In 1841, when Otto was finally forced to call upon a Greek politician, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, to become Prime Minister, the latter demanded that the Bavarians be removed from their commanding positions, and that a process of replacement of the remaining volunteers be begun. Although Otto was willing to replace Schmaltz as Minister for Military Affairs with a Greek, Andreas Metaxas, he rejected the second demand. Tensions between the Greek and Bavarian officers increased during the period, and reached a boiling point in 1842: during the annual celebration for the start of the War of Independence on 25 March, the Greek artillery officers in Nafplion publicly demanded the removal of the remaining foreign volunteers. The Bavarian commander of the artillery imposed a 20-day prison sentence on them, which caused an uproar in the press. The government quickly quashed the sentence, but reassigned the protesting officers to other garrisons, while the commander remained in place. 181 Bavarian officers remained in the army lists until the 3 September 1843 Revolution that introduced constitutional government and ended the Bavarian domination of the army by dismissing all foreigners apart from the \\"old Philhellenes\\" who had fought in the War of Independence. Assessment Obverse and reverse of the Cross for the Royal Bavarian Auxiliary Corps, instituted in 1833 by the Greek government The Bavarian Auxiliary Corps was contentious during its existence, and caused great resentment among the Greeks. Historians generally agree that its record was poor, particularly in comparison with the French who had preceded them; not only were the latter much better in training and organizing the Greek army, they also proved more capable and willing to assist the Greeks by building fortifications, bridges, and other infrastructure, without recompense. The Bavarians, on the other hand, despite their high salaries and longer stay in the country, left almost no buildings of note. A large part of the problem originated with the recruitment of the Corps. Most of the volunteers were low- ranking soldiers or even simple artisans, who in Greece found themselves promoted to officers; many of the recruits were adventurers, while others were the dregs of society in their home countries. In the words of the official Hellenic Army history, \\"the Hellenic Army benefited in no way from the Bavarians who took service as trainers and organizers\\", as the Bavarian officers, rapidly promoted from junior positions to higher ranks, lacked the experience necessary to properly organize the new army, and were unable to take into consideration the country's peculiar circumstances, climate, or the character of its people. It is telling that almost the only drill and exercises carried out during this period were at the company level, which was what the Bavarian officers were familiar with. This lack of skills made the retention of so many Bavarian officers after 1837 even more galling to the Greeks. According to newspaper accounts from 1842, of the remaining Bavarian officers at the time, only the four technicians in the Nafplion arsenal, and a single captain of the Engineers were absolutely necessary due to their technical skills. The costs of recruitment and maintenance of the Corps were exorbitant for the means available to Greece, especially so soon after the end of the destructive War of Independence; the Corps took a lion's share of the Greek military budget, for little in return. Of the 7,028,207 drachmas in the 1833 budget of the Ministry for Military Affairs, 1,220,582 (17.4%) were spent on recruitment in Bavaria, and 2,786,067 (39.6%) on maintenance of the Corps. In the next year, out of a budget of 8,505,208 drachmas, the respective figures were 1,371,431 (16.1%) and 1,740,282 (20.5%) respectively. It is indicative that the 25 Bavarian officers serving in the artillery in 1842 cost 5,470 drachmas, whereas their 27 Greek colleagues, most of whom had received better education as graduates of the Hellenic Military Academy, cost 3,910 drachmas. One account places the total expenses incurred by the Greek fisc on account of the Auxiliary Corps to the \\"astronomic sum\\" (Kastanis) of 66,842,126 drachmas. So great was the financial burden, that France refused to provide guarantees for the third instalment of the 60,000,000-franc loan stipulated in the Treaty of London, unless the Bavarian army left the country. Legacy The military colony at Iraklion quickly assimilated into Greek society, and their descendants virtually forgot their German roots. During World War II, Heinrich Himmler, who learned of the German origin of many Irakliotes, came in person to the area and took measures to ensure their comfort amidst the Great Famine. About a hundred Irakliotes were even persuaded to move to Germany as Volksdeutsche and join the German war effort, but once in Bavaria they found a hostile welcome; and when they returned home in 1945, they found their properties confiscated by the Greek government. The Greek beer brand Fix is owed to one of these Bavarian colonists, Johann Adam Fuchs, an engineer who settled in Iraklion. His son Johann Georg came to visit him from Bavaria but found that he had died just before his arrival. He then settled in Greece and opened up a brewery, which became known by the Hellenized form of his name as \\"Fix\\".

Tequixquiac, INADEP. The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by illness and epidemics with Indigenous people. It became the patron saint of Santiago Tequixquiac, and is one of the most well-known images in Mexico State. It was probably created in Actopan ex-monastery by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The author is unknown and belongs to the Spanish colonial period. The Christ image dates from the first half of the seventeenth century and measures 1.73 meters high. There is a strong relationship with Cryptojudaism because in this town its first Iberian inhabitants were Sephardic converts to Christianity arrived with Hern√°n Cort√©s; in the face of the image are very obvious a rabbinical signs, one of them are payots or curls in the side hair.

These temporal changes are responsible for several aspects of auditory perception, including loudness, pitch and timbre perception and spatial hearing. Complex sounds such as speech or music are decomposed by the peripheral auditory system of humans into narrow frequency bands. The resulting narrow-band signals convey information at different time scales ranging from less than one millisecond to hundreds of milliseconds. A dichotomy between slow \\"temporal envelope\\" cues and faster \\"temporal fine structure\\" cues has been proposed to study several aspects of auditory perception (e.g., loudness, pitch and timbre perception, auditory scene analysis, sound localization) at two distinct time scales in each frequency band. Over the last decades, a wealth of psychophysical, electrophysiological and computational studies based on this envelope/fine- structure dichotomy have examined the role of these temporal cues in sound identification and communication, how these temporal cues are processed by the peripheral and central auditory system, and the effects of aging and cochlear damage on temporal auditory processing. Although the envelope/fine-structure dichotomy has been debated and questions remain as to how temporal fine structure cues are actually encoded in the auditory system, these studies have led to a range of applications in various fields including speech and audio processing, clinical audiology and rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss via hearing aids or cochlear implants.  Definition  Outputs of simulated cochlear filters centred at 364, 1498 and 4803 Hz (from bottom to top) in response to a segment of a speech signal, the sound ‚Äúen‚Äù in ‚Äúsense‚Äù. These filter outputs are similar to the waveforms that would be observed at places on the basilar membrane tuned to 364, 1498 and 4803 Hz. For each centre frequency, the signal can be considered as a slowly-varying envelope (EBM) imposed on a more rapid temporal fine structure (TFSBM). The envelope for each band signal is shown by the thick line.Notions of temporal envelope and temporal fine structure may have different meanings in many studies. An important distinction to make is between the physical (i.e., acoustical) and the biological (or perceptual) description of these ENV and TFS cues.Schematic representation of the three levels of temporal envelope (ENV) and temporal fine structure (TFS) cues conveyed by a band-limited signal processed by the peripheral auditory system.Any sound whose frequency components cover a narrow range (called a narrowband signal) can be considered as an envelope (ENVp, where p denotes the physical signal) superimposed on a more rapidly oscillating carrier, the temporal fine structure (TFSp). Many sounds in everyday life, including speech and music, are broadband; the frequency components spread over a wide range and there is no well-defined way to represent the signal in terms of ENVp and TFSp. However, in a normally functioning cochlea, complex broadband signals are decomposed by the filtering on the basilar membrane (BM) within the cochlea into a series of narrowband signals. Therefore, the waveform at each place on the BM can be considered as an envelope (ENVBM) superimposed on a more rapidly oscillating carrier, the temporal fine structure (TFSBM). The ENVBM and TFSBM depend on the place along the BM. At the apical end, which is tuned to low (audio) frequencies, ENVBM and TFSBM vary relatively slowly with time, while at the basal end, which is tuned to high frequencies, both ENVBM and TFSBM vary more rapidly with time. Both ENVBM and TFSBM are represented in the time patterns of action potentials in the auditory nerve these are denoted ENVn and TFSn. TFSn is represented most prominently in neurons tuned to low frequencies, while ENVn is represented most prominently in neurons tuned to high (audio) frequencies. For a broadband signal, it is not possible to manipulate TFSp without affecting ENVBM and ENVn, and it is not possible to manipulate ENVp without affecting TFSBM and TFSn.  Temporal envelope (ENV) processing = Neurophysiological aspects = Examples of sinusoidally amplitude- and frequency-modulated signals The neural representation of stimulus envelope, ENVn, has typically been studied using well-controlled ENVp modulations, that is sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (AM) sounds. Cochlear filtering limits the range of AM rates encoded in individual auditory-nerve fibers. In the auditory nerve, the strength of the neural representation of AM decreases with increasing modulation rate. At the level of the cochlear nucleus, several cell types show an enhancement of ENVn information. Multipolar cells can show band- pass tuning to AM tones with AM rates between 50 and 1000 Hz. Some of these cells show an excellent response to the ENVn and provide inhibitory sideband inputs to other cells in the cochlear nucleus giving a physiological correlate of comodulation masking release, a phenomenon whereby the detection of a signal in a masker is improved when the masker has correlated envelope fluctuations across frequency (see section below). Responses to the temporal- envelope cues of speech or other complex sounds persist up the auditory pathway, eventually to the various fields of the auditory cortex in many animals. In the Primary Auditory Cortex, responses can encode AM rates by phase-locking up to about 20‚Äì30 Hz, while faster rates induce sustained and often tuned responses. A topographical representation of AM rate has been demonstrated in the primary auditory cortex of awake macaques. This representation is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the tonotopic gradient, consistent with an orthogonal organization of spectral and temporal features in the auditory cortex. Combining these temporal responses with the spectral selectivity of A1 neurons gives rise to the spectro-temporal receptive fields that often capture well cortical responses to complex modulated sounds. In secondary auditory cortical fields, responses become temporally more sluggish and spectrally broader, but are still able to phase- lock to the salient features of speech and musical sounds. Tuning to AM rates below about 64 Hz is also found in the human auditory cortex as revealed by brain-imaging techniques (fMRI) and cortical recordings in epileptic patients (electrocorticography). This is consistent with neuropsychological studies of brain-damaged patients and with the notion that the central auditory system performs some form of spectral decomposition of the ENVp of incoming sounds. The ranges over which cortical responses encode well the temporal-envelope cues of speech have been shown to be predictive of the human ability to understand speech. In the human superior temporal gyrus (STG), an anterior- posterior spatial organization of spectro-temporal modulation tuning has been found in response to speech sounds, the posterior STG being tuned for temporally fast varying speech sounds with low spectral modulations and the anterior STG being tuned for temporally slow varying speech sounds with high spectral modulations. One unexpected aspect of phase locking in the auditory cortex has been observed in the responses elicited by complex acoustic stimuli with spectrograms that exhibit relatively slow envelopes (< 20 Hz), but that are carried by fast modulations that are as high as hundreds of Hertz. Speech and music, as well as various modulated noise stimuli have such temporal structure. For these stimuli, cortical responses phase-lock to both the envelope and fine-structure induced by interactions between unresolved harmonics of the sound, thus reflecting the pitch of the sound, and exceeding the typical lower limits of cortical phase-locking to the envelopes of a few 10‚Äôs of Hertz. This paradoxical relation between the slow and fast cortical phase-locking to the carrier ‚Äúfine structure‚Äù has been demonstrated both in the auditory and visual cortices. It has also been shown to be amply manifested in measurements of the spectro-temporal receptive fields of the primary auditory cortex giving them unexpectedly fine temporal accuracy and selectivity bordering on a 5-10 ms resolution. The underlying causes of this phenomenon have been attributed to several possible origins, including nonlinear synaptic depression and facilitation, and/or a cortical network of thalamic excitation and cortical inhibition. There are many functionally significant and perceptually relevant reasons for the coexistence of these two complementary dynamic response modes. They include the ability to accurately encode onsets and other rapid ‚Äòevents‚Äô in the ENVp of complex acoustic and other sensory signals, features that are critical for the perception of consonants (speech) and percussive sounds (music), as well as the texture of complex sounds. = Psychoacoustical aspects = The perception of ENVp depends on which AM rates are contained in the signal. Low rates of AM, in the 1‚Äì8 Hz range, are perceived as changes in perceived intensity, that is loudness fluctuations (a percept that can also be evoked by frequency modulation, FM); at higher rates, AM is perceived as roughness, with the greatest roughness sensation occurring at around 70 Hz; at even higher rates, AM can evoke a weak pitch percept corresponding to the modulation rate. Rainstorms, crackling fire, chirping crickets or galloping horses produce \\"sound textures\\" - the collective result of many similar acoustic events - which perception is mediated by ENVn statistics. The auditory detection threshold for AM as a function of AM rate, referred to as the temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF), is best for AM rates in the range from 4 ‚Äì 150 Hz and worsens outside that range The cutoff frequency of the TMTF gives an estimate of temporal acuity (temporal resolution) for the auditory system. This cutoff frequency corresponds to a time constant of about 1 - 3 ms for the auditory system of normal-hearing humans. Correlated envelope fluctuations across frequency in a masker can aid detection of a pure tone signal, an effect known as comodulation masking release. AM applied to a given carrier can perceptually interfere with the detection of a target AM imposed on the same carrier, an effect termed modulation masking. Modulation-masking patterns are tuned (greater masking occurs for masking and target AMs close in modulation rate), suggesting that the human auditory system is equipped with frequency-selective channels for AM. Moreover, AM applied to spectrally remote carriers can perceptually interfere with the detection of AM on a target sound, an effect termed modulation detection interference. The notion of modulation channels is also supported by the demonstration of selective adaptation effects in the modulation domain. These studies show that AM detection thresholds are selectively elevated above pre-exposure thresholds when the carrier frequency and the AM rate of the adaptor are similar to those of the test tone. Human listeners are sensitive to relatively slow \\"second- order\\" AMs cues correspond to fluctuations in the strength of AM. These cues arise from the interaction of different modulation rates, previously described as \\"beating\\" in the envelope-frequency domain. Perception of second-order AM has been interpreted as resulting from nonlinear mechanisms in the auditory pathway that produce an audible distortion component at the envelope beat frequency in the internal modulation spectrum of the sounds. Interaural time differences in the envelope provide binaural cues even at high frequencies where TFSn cannot be used. = Models of normal envelope processing = Diagram of the common part of the envelope perception model of Torsten Dau and EPSM. The most basic computer model of ENV processing is the leaky integrator model. This model extracts the temporal envelope of the sound (ENVp) via bandpass filtering, half-wave rectification (which may be followed by fast- acting amplitude compression), and lowpass filtering with a cutoff frequency between about 60 and 150 Hz. The leaky integrator is often used with a decision statistic based on either the resulting envelope power, the max/min ratio, or the crest factor. This model accounts for the loss of auditory sensitivity for AM rates higher than about 60‚Äì150 Hz for broadband noise carriers. Based on the concept of frequency selectivity for AM, the perception model of Torsten Dau incorporates broadly tuned bandpass modulation filters (with a Q value around 1) to account for data from a broad variety of psychoacoustic tasks and particularly AM detection for noise carriers with different bandwidths, taking into account their intrinsic envelope fluctuations. This model of has been extended to account for comodulation masking release (see sections above). The shapes of the modulation filters have been estimated and an ‚Äúenvelope power spectrum model‚Äù (EPSM) based on these filters can account for AM masking patterns and AM depth discrimination. The EPSM has been extended to the prediction of speech intelligibility and to account for data from a broad variety of psychoacoustic tasks. A physiologically-based processing model simulating brainstem responses has also been developed to account for AM detection and AM masking patterns.  Temporal fine structure (TFS) processing = Neurophysiological aspects = Phase locking recorded from a neuron in the cochlear nucleus in response to a sinusoidal acoustic stimulus at the cell‚Äôs best frequency (in this case 240 Hz). The stimulus was approximately 20 dB above the neuron‚Äôs best frequency. The neural outputs (action potentials) are shown in the upper trace and the stimulus waveform in the lower trace. The neural representation of temporal fine structure, TFSn, has been studied using stimuli with well-controlled TFSp: pure tones, harmonic complex tones, and frequency-modulated (FM) tones. Auditory-nerve fibres are able to represent low-frequency sounds via their phase-locked discharges (i.e., TFSn information). The upper frequency limit for phase locking is species dependent. It is about 5 kHz in the cat, 9 kHz in the barn owl and just 4 kHz in the guinea pig. We do not know the upper limit of phase locking in humans but current, indirect, estimates suggest it is about 4‚Äì5 kHz. Phase locking is a direct consequence of the transduction process with an increase in probability of transduction channel opening occurring with a stretching of the stereocilia and decrease in channel opening occurring when pushed in the opposite direction. This has led some to suggest that phase locking is an epiphenomenon. The upper limit appears to be determined by a cascade of low pass filters at the level of the inner hair cell and auditory-nerve synapse. TFSn information in the auditory nerve may be used to encode the (audio) frequency of low-frequency sounds, including single tones and more complex stimuli such as frequency-modulated tones or steady- state vowels (see role and applications to speech and music). The auditory system goes to some length to preserve this TFSn information with the presence of giant synapses (End bulbs of Held) in the ventral cochlear nucleus. These synapses contact bushy cells (Spherical and globular) and faithfully transmit (or enhance) the temporal information present in the auditory nerve fibers to higher structures in the brainstem. The bushy cells project to the medial superior olive and the globular cells project to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). The MNTB is also characterized by giant synapses (calyces of Held) and provides precisely timed inhibition to the lateral superior olive. The medial and lateral superior olive and MNTB are involved in the encoding of interaural time and intensity differences. There is general acceptance that the temporal information is crucial in sound localization but it is still contentious as to whether the same temporal information is used to encode the frequency of complex sounds. Several problems remain with the idea that the TFSn is important in the representation of the frequency components of complex sounds. The first problem is that the temporal information deteriorates as it passes through successive stages of the auditory pathway (presumably due to the low pass dendritic filtering). Therefore, the second problem is that the temporal information must be extracted at an early stage of the auditory pathway. No such stage has currently been identified although there are theories about how temporal information can be converted into rate information (see section Models of normal processing: Limitations). = Psychoacoustical aspects = It is often assumed that many perceptual capacities rely on the ability of the monaural and binaural auditory system to encode and use TFSn cues evoked by components in sounds with frequencies below about 1‚Äì4 kHz. These capacities include discrimination of frequency, discrimination of the fundamental frequency of harmonic sounds, detection of FM at rates below 5 Hz, melody recognition for sequences of pure tones and complex tones, lateralization and localization of pure tones and complex tones, and segregation of concurrent harmonic sounds (such as speech sounds). It appears that TFSn cues require correct tonotopic (place) representation to be processed optimally by the auditory system. Moreover, musical pitch perception has been demonstrated for complex tones with all harmonics above 6 kHz, demonstrating that it is not entirely dependent on neural phase locking to TFSBM (i.e., TFSn) cues. As for FM detection, the current view assumes that in the normal auditory system, FM is encoded via TFSn cues when the FM rate is low (<5 Hz) and when the carrier frequency is below about 4 kHz, and via ENVn cues when the FM is fast or when the carrier frequency is higher than 4 kHz. This is supported by single-unit recordings in the low brainstem. According to this view, TFSn cues are not used to detect FM with rates above about 10 Hz because the mechanism decoding the TFSn information is ‚Äúsluggish‚Äù and cannot track rapid changes in frequency. Several studies have shown that auditory sensitivity to slow FM at low carrier frequency is associated with speech identification for both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals when speech reception is limited by acoustic degradations (e.g., filtering) or concurrent speech sounds. This suggests that robust speech intelligibility is determined by accurate processing of TFSn cues. = Models of normal processing: limitations = The separation of a sound into ENVp and TFSp appears inspired partly by how sounds are synthesized and by the availability of a convenient way to separate an existing sound into ENV and TFS, namely the Hilbert transform. There is a risk that this view of auditory processing is dominated by these physical/technical concepts, similarly to how cochlear frequency-to-place mapping was for a long time conceptualized in terms of the Fourier transform. Physiologically, there is no indication of a separation of ENV and TFS in the auditory system for stages up to the cochlear nucleus. Only at that stage does it appear that parallel pathways, potentially enhancing ENVn or TFSn information (or something akin to it), may be implemented through the temporal response characteristics of different cochlear nucleus cell types. It may therefore be useful to better simulate cochlear nucleus cell types to understand the true concepts for parallel processing created at the level of the cochlear nucleus. These concepts may be related to separating ENV and TFS but are unlikely realized like the Hilbert transform. A computational model of the peripheral auditory system may be used to simulate auditory-nerve fiber responses to complex sounds such as speech, and quantify the transmission (i.e., internal representation) of ENVn and TFSn cues. In two simulation studies, the mean-rate and spike-timing information was quantified at the output of such a model to characterize, respectively, the short-term rate of neural firing (ENVn) and the level of synchronization due to phase locking (TFSn) in response to speech sounds degraded by vocoders. The best model predictions of vocoded-speech intelligibility were found when both ENVn and TFSn cues were included, providing evidence that TFSn cues are important for intelligibility when the speech ENVp cues are degraded. At a more fundamental level, similar computational modeling was used to demonstrate that the functional dependence of human just-noticeable-frequency-differences on pure-tone frequency were not accounted for unless temporal information was included (notably most so for mid-high frequencies, even above the nominal cutoff in physiological phase locking). However, a caveat of most TFS models is that optimal model performance with temporal information typically over- estimates human performance. An alternative view is to assume that TFSn information at the level of the auditory nerve is converted into rate-place (ENVn) information at a later stage of the auditory system (e.g., the low brainstem). Several modelling studies proposed that the neural mechanisms for decoding TFSn are based on correlation of the outputs of adjacent places.  Role in speech and music perception = Role of temporal envelope in speech and music perception = Amplitude modulation spectra (left) and frequency modulation spectra (right), calculated on a corpus of English or French sentences. The ENVp plays a critical role in many aspects of auditory perception, including in the perception of speech and music. Speech recognition is possible using cues related to the ENVp, even in situations where the original spectral information and TFSp are highly degraded. Indeed, when the spectrally local TFSp from one sentence is combined with the ENVp from a second sentence, only the words of the second sentence are heard. The ENVp rates most important for speech are those below about 16 Hz, corresponding to fluctuations at the rate of syllables. On the other hand, the fundamental frequency (‚Äúpitch‚Äù) contour of speech sounds is primarily conveyed via TFSp cues, although some information on the contour can be perceived via rapid envelope fluctuations corresponding to the fundamental frequency. For music, slow ENVp rates convey rhythm and tempo information, whereas more rapid rates convey the onset and offset properties of sound (attack and decay, respectively) that are important for timbre perception. = Role of TFS in speech and music perception = The ability to accurately process TFSp information is thought to play a role in our perception of pitch (i.e., the perceived height of sounds), an important sensation for music perception, as well as our ability to understand speech, especially in the presence of background noise.  Role of TFS in pitch perception  Although pitch retrieval mechanisms in the auditory system are still a matter of debate, TFSn information may be used to retrieve the pitch of low-frequency pure tones and estimate the individual frequencies of the low-numbered (ca. 1st-8th) harmonics of a complex sound, frequencies from which the fundamental frequency of the sound can be retrieved according to, e.g., pattern-matching models of pitch perception. A role of TFSn information in pitch perception of complex sounds containing intermediate harmonics (ca. 7th-16th) has also been suggested and may be accounted for by temporal or spectrotemporal models of pitch perception. The degraded TFSn cues conveyed by cochlear implant devices may also be partly responsible for impaired music perception of cochlear implant recipients.  Role of TFS cues in speech perception  TFSp cues are thought to be important for the identification of speakers and for tone identification in tonal languages. In addition, several vocoder studies have suggested that TFSp cues contribute to the intelligibility of speech in quiet and noise. Although it is difficult to isolate TFSp from ENVp cues, there is evidence from studies in hearing-impaired listeners that speech perception in the presence of background noise can be partly accounted for by the ability to accurately process TFSp, although the ability to ‚Äúlisten in the dips‚Äù of fluctuating maskers does not seem to depend on periodic TFSp cues.  Role in environmental sound perception  Environmental sounds can be broadly defined as nonspeech and nonmusical sounds in the listener‚Äôs environment that can convey meaningful information about surrounding objects and events. Environmental sounds are highly heterogeneous in terms of their acoustic characteristics and source types, and may include human and animal vocalizations, water and weather related events, mechanical and electronic signaling sounds. Given a great variety in sound sources that give rise to environmental sounds both ENVp and TFSp play an important role in their perception. However, the relative contributions of ENVp and TFSp can differ considerably for specific environmental sounds. This is reflected in the variety of acoustic measures that correlate with different perceptual characteristics of objects and events. Early studies highlighted the importance of envelope-based temporal patterning in perception of environmental events. For instance, Warren & Verbrugge, demonstrated that constructed sounds of a glass bottle dropped on the floor were perceived as bouncing when high-energy regions in four different frequency bands were temporally aligned, producing amplitude peaks in the envelope. In contrast, when the same spectral energy was distributed randomly across bands the sounds were heard as breaking. More recent studies using vocoder simulations of cochlear implant processing demonstrated that many temporally-patterned sounds can be perceived with little original spectral information, based primarily on temporal cues . Such sounds as footsteps, horse galloping, helicopter flying, ping-pong playing, clapping, typing were identified with a high accuracy of 70% or more with a single channel of envelope-modulated broadband noise or with only two frequency channels. In these studies, envelope-based acoustic measures such as number of bursts and peaks in the envelope were predictive of listeners‚Äô abilities to identify sounds based primarily on ENVp cues. On the other hand, identification of brief environmental sounds without strong temporal patterning in ENVp may require a much larger number of frequency channels to perceive. Sounds such as a car horn or a train whistle were poorly identified even with as many as 32 frequency channels. Listeners with cochlear implants, which transmit envelope information for specific frequency bands, but do not transmit TFSp, have considerably reduced abilities in identification of common environmental sounds. In addition, individual environmental sounds are typically heard within the context of larger auditory scenes where sounds from multiple sources may overlap in time and frequency. When heard within an auditory scene, accurate identification of individual environmental sounds is contingent on the ability to segregate them from other sound sources or auditory streams in the auditory scene, which involves further reliance on ENVp and TFSp cues (see Role in auditory scene analysis).  Role in auditory scene analysis  Auditory scene analysis refers to the ability to perceive separately sounds coming from different sources. Any acoustical difference can potentially lead to auditory segregation, and so any cues based either on ENVp or TFSp are likely to assist in segregating competing sound sources. Such cues involve percepts such as pitch. Binaural TFSp cues producing interaural time differences have not always resulted in clear source segregation, particularly with simultaneously presented sources, although successful segregation of sequential sounds, such as noise or speech, have been reported.  Effects of age and hearing loss on temporal envelope processing = Developmental aspects = In infancy, behavioral AM detection thresholds and forward or backward masking thresholds observed in 3-month olds are similar to those observed in adults. Electrophysiological studies conducted in 1-month-old infants using 2000 Hz AM pure tones indicate some immaturity in envelope following response (EFR). Although sleeping infants and sedated adults show the same effect of modulation rate on EFR, infants‚Äô estimates were generally poorer than adults‚Äô. This is consistent with behavioral studies conducted with school-age children showing differences in AM detection thresholds compared to adults. Children systematically show worse AM detection thresholds than adults until 10‚Äì11 years. However, the shape of the TMTF (the cutoff) is similar to adults‚Äô for younger children of 5 years. Sensory versus non-sensory factors for this long maturation are still debated, but the results generally appear to be more dependent on the task or on sound complexity for infants and children than for adults. Regarding the development of speech ENVp processing, vocoder studies suggest that infants as young as 3 months are able to discriminate a change in consonants when the faster ENVp information of the syllables is preserved (< 256 Hz) but less so when only the slowest ENVp is available (< 8 Hz). Older children of 5 years show similar abilities than adults to discriminate consonant changes based on ENVp cues (< 64 Hz). = Neurophysiological aspects = The effects of hearing loss and age on neural coding are generally believed to be smaller for slowly varying envelope responses (i.e., ENVn) than for rapidly varying temporal fine structure (i.e., TFSn). Enhanced ENVn coding following noise-induced hearing loss has been observed in peripheral auditory responses from single neurons and in central evoked responses from the auditory midbrain. The enhancement in ENVn coding of narrowband sounds occurs across the full range of modulation frequencies encoded by single neurons. For broadband sounds, the range of modulation frequencies encoded in impaired responses is broader than normal (extending to higher frequencies), as expected from reduced frequency selectivity associated with outer-hair-cell dysfunction. The enhancement observed in neural envelope responses is consistent with enhanced auditory perception of modulations following cochlear damage, which is commonly believed to result from loss of cochlear compression that occurs with outer- hair-cell dysfunction due to age or noise overexposure. However, the influence of inner-hair-cell dysfunction (e.g., shallower response growth for mild-moderate damage and steeper growth for severe damage) can confound the effects of outer-hair-cell dysfunction on overall response growth and thus ENVn coding. Thus, not surprisingly the relative effects of outer-hair-cell and inner-hair-cell dysfunction have been predicted with modeling to create individual differences in speech intelligibility based on the strength of envelope coding of speech relative to noise. = Psychoacoustical aspects = For sinusoidal carriers, which have no intrinsic envelope (ENVp) fluctuations, the TMTF is roughly flat for AM rates from 10 to 120 Hz, but increases (i.e. threshold worsens) for higher AM rates, provided that spectral sidebands are not audible. The shape of the TMTF for sinusoidal carriers is similar for young and older people with normal audiometric thresholds, but older people tend to have higher detection thresholds overall, suggesting poorer ‚Äúdetection efficiency‚Äù for ENVn cues in older people. Provided that the carrier is fully audible, the ability to detect AM is usually not adversely affected by cochlear hearing loss and may sometimes be better than normal, for both noise carriers and sinusoidal carriers, perhaps because loudness recruitment (an abnormally rapid growth of loudness with increasing sound level) ‚Äúmagnifies‚Äù the perceived amount of AM (i.e., ENVn cues). Consistent with this, when the AM is clearly audible, a sound with a fixed AM depth appears to fluctuate more for an impaired ear than for a normal ear. However, the ability to detect changes in AM depth can be impaired by cochlear hearing loss. Speech that is processed with noise vocoder such that mainly envelope information is delivered in multiple spectral channels was also used in investigating envelope processing in hearing impairment. Here, hearing-impaired individuals could not make use of such envelope information as well as normal-hearing individuals, even after audibility factors were taken into account. Additional experiments suggest that age negatively affects the binaural processing of ENVp at least at low audio-frequencies. = Models of impaired temporal envelope processing = The perception model of ENV processing that incorporates selective (bandpass) AM filters accounts for many perceptual consequences of cochlear dysfunction including enhanced sensitivity to AM for sinusoidal and noise carriers, abnormal forward masking (the rate of recovery from forward masking being generally slower than normal for impaired listeners), stronger interference effects between AM and FM and enhanced temporal integration of AM. The model of Torsten Dau has been extended to account for the discrimination of complex AM patterns by hearing-impaired individuals and the effects of noise-reduction systems. The performance of the hearing-impaired individuals was best captured when the model combined the loss of peripheral amplitude compression resulting from the loss of the active mechanism in the cochlea with an increase in internal noise in the ENVn domain. Phenomenological models simulating the response of the peripheral auditory system showed that impaired AM sensitivity in individuals experiencing chronic tinnitus with clinically normal audiograms could be predicted by substantial loss of auditory-nerve fibers with low spontaneous rates and some loss of auditory-nerve fibers with high-spontaneous rates.  Effects of age and hearing loss on TFS processing = Developmental aspects = Very few studies have systematically assessed TFS processing in infants and children. Frequency-following response (FFR), thought to reflect phase- locked neural activity, appears to be adult-like in 1-month-old infants when using a pure tone (centered at 500, 1000 or 2000 Hz) modulated at 80 Hz with a 100% of modulation depth. As for behavioral data, six-month-old infants require larger frequency transitions to detect a FM change in a 1-kHz tone compared to adults. However, 4-month-old infants are able to discriminate two different FM sweeps, and they are more sensitive to FM cues swept from 150 Hz to 550 Hz than at lower frequencies. In school-age children, performance in detecting FM change improves between 6 and 10 years and sensitivity to low modulation rate (2 Hz) is poor until 9 years. For speech sounds, only one vocoder study has explored the ability of school age children to rely on TFSp cues to detect consonant changes, showing the same abilities for 5-years-olds than adults. = Neurophysiological aspects = Psychophysical studies have suggested that degraded TFS processing due to age and hearing loss may underlie some suprathreshold deficits, such as speech perception; however, debate remains about the underlying neural correlates. The strength of phase locking to the temporal fine structure of signals (TFSn) in quiet listening conditions remains normal in peripheral single-neuron responses following cochlear hearing loss. Although these data suggest that the fundamental ability of auditory-nerve fibers to follow the rapid fluctuations of sound remains intact following cochlear hearing loss, deficits in phase locking strength do emerge in background noise. This finding, which is consistent with the common observation that listeners with cochlear hearing loss have more difficulty in noisy conditions, results from reduced cochlear frequency selectivity associated with outer-hair-cell dysfunction. Although only limited effects of age and hearing loss have been observed in terms of TFSn coding strength of narrowband sounds, more dramatic deficits have been observed in TFSn coding quality in response to broadband sounds, which are more relevant for everyday listening. A dramatic loss of tonotopicity can occur following noise induced hearing loss, where auditory-nerve fibers that should be responding to mid frequencies (e.g., 2‚Äì4 kHz) have dominant TFS responses to lower frequencies (e.g., 700 Hz). Notably, the loss of tonotopicity generally occurs only for TFSn coding but not for ENVn coding, which is consistent with greater perceptual deficits in TFS processing. This tonotopic degradation is likely to have important implications for speech perception, and can account for degraded coding of vowels following noise- induced hearing loss in which most of the cochlea responds to only the first formant, eliminating the normal tonotopic representation of the second and third formants. = Psychoacoustical aspects = Several psychophysical studies have shown that older people with normal hearing and people with sensorineural hearing loss often show impaired performance for auditory tasks that are assumed to rely on the ability of the monaural and binaural auditory system to encode and use TFSn cues, such as: discrimination of sound frequency, discrimination of the fundamental frequency of harmonic sounds, detection of FM at rates below 5 Hz, melody recognition for sequences of pure tones and complex sounds, lateralization and localization of pure tones and complex tones, and segregation of concurrent harmonic sounds (such as speech sounds). However, it remains unclear to which extent deficits associated with hearing loss reflect poorer TFSn processing or reduced cochlear frequency selectivity. = Models of impaired processing = The quality of the representation of a sound in the auditory nerve is limited by refractoriness, adaptation, saturation, and reduced synchronization (phase locking) at high frequencies, as well as by the stochastic nature of actions potentials. However, the auditory nerve contains thousands of fibers. Hence, despite these limiting factors, the properties of sounds are reasonably well represented in the population nerve response over a wide range of levels and audio frequencies (see Volley Theory). The coding of temporal information in the auditory nerve can be disrupted by two main mechanisms: reduced synchrony and loss of synapses and/or auditory nerve fibers. The impact of disrupted temporal coding on human auditory perception has been explored using physiologically inspired signal-processing tools. The reduction in neural synchrony has been simulated by jittering the phases of the multiple frequency components in speech, although this has undesired effects in the spectral domain. The loss of auditory nerve fibers or synapses has been simulated by assuming (i) that each afferent fiber operates as a stochastic sampler of the sound waveform, with greater probability of firing for higher-intensity and sustained sound features than for lower-intensity or transient features, and (ii) that deafferentation can be modeled by reducing the number of samplers. However, this also has undesired effects in the spectral domain. Both jittering and stochastic undersampling degrade the representation of the TFSn more than the representation of the ENVn. Both jittering and stochastic undersampling impair the recognition of speech in noisy backgrounds without degrading recognition in silence, support the argument that TFSn is important for recognizing speech in noise. Both jittering and stochastic undersampling mimic the effects of aging on speech perception.  Transmission by hearing aids and cochlear implants = Temporal envelope transmission = Individuals with cochlear hearing loss usually have a smaller than normal dynamic range between the level of the weakest detectable sound and the level at which sounds become uncomfortably loud. To compress the large range of sound levels encountered in everyday life into the small dynamic range of the hearing-impaired person, hearing aids apply amplitude compression, which is also called automatic gain control (AGC). The basic principle of such compression is that the amount of amplification applied to the incoming sound progressively decreases as the input level increases. Usually, the sound is split into several frequency ‚Äúchannels‚Äù, and AGC is applied independently in each channel. As a result of compressing the level, AGC reduces the amount of envelope fluctuation in the input signal (ENVp) by an amount that depends on the rate of fluctuation and the speed with which the amplification changes in response to changes in input sound level. AGC can also change the shape of the envelope of the signal. Cochlear implants are devices that electrically stimulate the auditory nerve, thereby creating the sensation of sound in a person who would otherwise be profoundly or totally deaf. The electrical dynamic range is very small, so cochlear implants usually incorporate AGC prior to the signal being filtered into multiple frequency channels. The channel signals are then subjected to instantaneous compression to map them into the limited dynamic range for each channel. Cochlear implants differ than hearing aids in that the entire acoustic hearing is replaced with direct electric stimulation of the auditory nerve, achieved via an electrode array placed inside the cochlea. Hence, here, other factors than device signal processing also strongly contribute to overall hearing, such as etiology, nerve health, electrode configuration and proximity to the nerve, and overall adaptation process to an entirely new mode of hearing. Almost all information in cochlear implants is conveyed by the envelope fluctuations in the different channels. This is sufficient to give reasonable perception of speech in quiet, but not in noisy or reverberant conditions. The processing in cochlear implants is such that the TFSp is discarded in favor of fixed-rate pulse trains amplitude-modulated by the ENVp within each frequency band. Implant users are sensitive to these ENVp modulations, but performance varies across stimulation site, stimulation level, and across individuals. The TMTF shows a low-pass filter shape similar to that observed in normal-hearing listeners. Voice pitch or musical pitch information, conveyed primarily via weak periodicity cues in the ENVp, results in a pitch sensation that is not salient enough to support music perception, talker sex identification, lexical tones, or prosodic cues. Listeners with cochlear implants are susceptible to interference in the modulation domain which likely contributes to difficulties listening in noise. = Temporal fine structure transmission = Hearing aids usually process sounds by filtering them into multiple frequency channels and applying AGC in each channel. Other signal processing in hearing aids, such as noise reduction, also involves filtering the input into multiple channels. The filtering into channels can affect the TFSp of sounds depending on characteristics such as the phase response and group delay of the filters. However, such effects are usually small. Cochlear implants also filter the input signal into frequency channels. Usually, the ENVp of the signal in each channel is transmitted to the implanted electrodes in the form an electrical pulses of fixed rate that are modulated in amplitude or duration. Information about TFSp is discarded. This is justified by the observation that people with cochlear implants have a very limited ability to process TFSp information, even if it is transmitted to the electrodes, perhaps because of a mismatch between the temporal information and the place in the cochlea to which it is delivered Reducing this mismatch may improve the ability to use TFSp information and hence lead to better pitch perception. Some cochlear implant systems transmit information about TFSp in the channels of the cochlear implants that are tuned to low audio frequencies, and this may improve the pitch perception of low-frequency sounds.  Training effects and plasticity of temporal-envelope processing  Perceptual learning resulting from training has been reported for various auditory AM detection or discrimination tasks, suggesting that the responses of central auditory neurons to ENVp cues are plastic and that practice may modify the circuitry of ENVn processing. The plasticity of ENVn processing has been demonstrated in several ways. For instance, the ability of auditory-cortex neurons to discriminate voice-onset time cues for phonemes is degraded following moderate hearing loss (20-40 dB HL) induced by acoustic trauma. Interestingly, developmental hearing loss reduces cortical responses to slow, but not fast (100 Hz) AM stimuli, in parallel with behavioral performance. As a matter of fact, a transient hearing loss (15 days) occurring during the \\"critical period\\" is sufficient to elevate AM thresholds in adult gerbils. Even non-traumatic noise exposure reduces the phase-locking ability of cortical neurons as well as the animals' behavioral capacity to discriminate between different AM sounds. Behavioral training or pairing protocols involving neuromodulators also alter the ability of cortical neurons to phase lock to AM sounds. In humans, hearing loss may result in an unbalanced representation of speech cues: ENVn cues are enhanced at the cost of TFSn cues (see: Effects of age and hearing loss on temporal envelope processing). Auditory training may reduce the representation of speech ENVn cues for elderly listeners with hearing loss, who may then reach levels comparable to those observed for normal-hearing elderly listeners. Last, intensive musical training induces both behavioral effects such as higher sensitivity to pitch variations (for Mandarin linguistic pitch) and a better synchronization of brainstem responses to the f0-contour of lexical tones for musicians compared with non-musicians.  Clinical evaluation of TFS sensitivity  Fast and easy to administer psychophysical tests have been developed to assist clinicians in the screening of TFS-processing abilities and diagnosis of suprathreshold temporal auditory processing deficits associated with cochlear damage and ageing. These tests may also be useful for audiologists and hearing-aid manufacturers to explain and/or predict the outcome of hearing-aid fitting in terms of perceived quality, speech intelligibility or spatial hearing. These tests may eventually be used to recommend the most appropriate compression speed in hearing aids or the use of directional microphones. The need for such tests is corroborated by strong correlations between slow-FM or spectro-temporal modulation detection thresholds and aided speech intelligibility in competing backgrounds for hearing-impaired persons. Clinical tests can be divided into two groups: those assessing monaural TFS processing capacities (TFS1 test) and those assessing binaural capacities (binaural pitch, TFS-LF, TFS-AF). TFS1: this test assesses the ability to discriminate between an harmonic complex tone and its frequency-transposed (and thus, inharmonic) version. Binaural pitch: these tests evaluate the ability to detect and discriminate binaural pitch, and melody recognition using different types of binaural pitch. TFS-LF: this test assesses the ability to discriminate low-frequency pure tones that are identical at the two ears from the same tones differing in interaural phase. TFS AF: this test assesses the highest audio frequency of a pure tone up to which a change in interaural phase can be discriminated.  Objective measures using envelope and TFS cues  Signal distortion, additive noise, reverberation, and audio processing strategies such as noise suppression and dynamic-range compression can all impact speech intelligibility and speech and music quality. These changes in the perception of the signal can often be predicted by measuring the associated changes in the signal envelope and/or temporal fine structure (TFS). Objective measures of the signal changes, when combined with procedures that associate the signal changes with differences in auditory perception, give rise to auditory performance metrics for predicting speech intelligibility and speech quality. Changes in the TFS can be estimated by passing the signals through a filterbank and computing the coherence between the system input and output in each band. Intelligibility predicted from the coherence is accurate for some forms of additive noise and nonlinear distortion, but works poorly for ideal binary mask (IBM) noise suppression. Speech and music quality for signals subjected to noise and clipping distortion have also been modeled using the coherence or using the coherence averaged across short signal segments. Changes in the signal envelope can be measured using several different procedures. The presence of noise or reverberation will reduce the modulation depth of a signal, and multiband measurement of the envelope modulation depth of the system output is used in the speech transmission index (STI) to estimate intelligibility. While accurate for noise and reverberation applications, the STI works poorly for nonlinear processing such as dynamic-range compression. An extension to the STI estimates the change in modulation by cross-correlating the envelopes of the speech input and output signals. A related procedure, also using envelope cross-correlations, is the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure, which works well for its intended application in evaluating noise suppression, but which is less accurate for nonlinear distortion. Envelope- based intelligibility metrics have also been derived using modulation filterbanks and using envelope time-frequency modulation patterns. Envelope cross-correlation is also used for estimating speech and music quality. Envelope and TFS measurements can also be combined to form intelligibility and quality metrics. A family of metrics for speech intelligibility, speech quality, and music quality has been derived using a shared model of the auditory periphery that can represent hearing loss. Using a model of the impaired periphery leads to more accurate predictions for hearing-impaired listeners than using a normal-hearing model, and the combined envelope/TFS metric is generally more accurate than a metric that uses envelope modulation alone.
