Over his career in the majors, Haslin batted a combined .272 with 265 hits, 33 doubles, eight triples, nine home runs, and 109 runs batted in (RBIs) in 318 games played. He played shortstop, second base, and third base, defensively. Haslin also played in the semi-pros, and minor leagues before breaking into the majors. In the minors, he played with the St. Catharines Brewers (1930), Stroudsburg Poconos (1932), Kansas City Blues (1937), Jersey City Giants (1938), San Diego Padres (1939‚Äì1941), Toronto Maple Leafs (1942), and Indianapolis Indians (1943). Haslin compiled a career minor league batting average of .311 with 881 hits, 155 doubles, 30 triples, and 43 home runs in 776 games played. He batted and threw right-handed. During his playing career, Haslin stood at and weighed . After retirement from baseball, he served in the United States Army during World War II. Early and personal life Mickey Haslin was born Michael Joseph Hazlinsky on October 25, 1909 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to George\\"Family Trees For George Haslinsky on Ancestry.com Whose mother was Zuzanna Hazlinskyov√° n√©e Jasov√°; remarried \\"Usiznskyov√°\\". His father was Zuzanna \\"Anna\\"'s first husband, J√°n Hazlinsky. J√°n was also the father of three of Anna's other sons, including Marion \\"Martin\\" Haslinsky (whose maternal sister, Catherine Gajdos n√©e Uszinsky, referenced him as her brother when she purported to be \\"Maria Uscianski\\" instead of giving her actual name). and Helen Julia (n√©e Kmetzov√°) Hazlinsky, both of Austria Hungary. George Hazlinsky worked in the Pennsylvania coal mines. Mickey Haslin had eight siblings; brothers George, Joseph, and John; and sisters Mary, Elizabeth, Anna, Susan, and Margaret. Mickey Haslin attended high school for just one year. From an early age, Haslin worked in the coal mines of his home-town. Haslin had a fear of insects, and snakes, which caused many teammates to use them against him when playing a practical joke during his baseball career. Baseball career In 1930, Haslin signed with the minor league St. Catharines Brewers of the Class-C Ontario League. With the Brewers, he batted .295 with 57 hits, five doubles, three triples, and three home runs in 50 games played. Defensively, he was used as a shortstop. Haslin spent the next season playing semi-professional baseball. He joined the Class-D Stroudsburg Poconos in 1932, a team that featured future Major League Baseball (MLB) player Goody Rosen. Stroudsburg were members of the Interstate League that season. In 26 games that year, Haslin batted .417 with 48 hits, 13 doubles, four triples, and seven home runs. In the field, he played second base, and shortstop. Haslin signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at the end of the 1933 season after being discovered by scout Patsy O'Rourke at a semi- professional baseball game in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. At the start of the 1933 season, Haslin signed with the minor league Knoxville Smokies to play third base. However, he never made an appearance with that team. Instead, Haslin signed as a second baseman with a semi-professional baseball team, which represented Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Patsy O'Rourke, a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies, was in Stroudsburg visiting his wife who had been injured in an automobile accident. O'Rourke went to a semi-pro game which featured Haslin's team. His talent impressed O'Rourke, so he offered Haslin a major league contract with the Phillies on the spot. He made his MLB debut on September 7, against the St. Louis Cardinals. In that game, Haslin got his first major league hit, a double. He also walked once, and played the second base position. Haslin's first major league run batted in (RBI) came on September 14, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Over 26 games that season with the Phillies, he batted .236 with three runs scored, 21 hits, two doubles, nine RBIs, and one stolen base. Haslin played all of his 26 games at second base, committing six errors, and converting 12 assists in 137 total chances. Haslin was used as the Philadelphia Phillies' starting shortstop at the beginning of the 1934 season after Dick Bartell, the Phillies every-day shortstop, suffered an injury. Haslin's first hit of the season came on April 12, against the Brooklyn Dodgers. He hit his first career major league home run on June 10, against the New York Giants. He finished the season with a .265 batting average, 28 runs scored, 44 hits, eight doubles, two triples, one home run, 11 RBIs, and one stolen base in 72 games played that year. Defensively, he was used as a utility infielder, playing 26 games at third base, 21 games at second base, and six games at shortstop. In 1935, Haslin won the starting shortstop job for the Philadelphia Phillies over veteran Blondy Ryan. On April 18, during the top of the tenth inning in a game against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Haslin batted in the game-winning run to give the Phillies a 10‚Äìto‚Äì9 win. Haslin participated in the first-ever MLB night game that season, driving in the Phillies only run against the Cincinnati Reds in a 2‚Äìto‚Äì1 loss. During the season, it was reported that Haslin carried around a lump of coal as a good-luck charm, and a reminder of how far he has come from his days of mining in his home-town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In late-August, it was discovered that Haslin had appendicitis, causing him to miss time after recovering from emergency surgery to remove his vermiform appendix at Sacred Heart Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania. On the season, he batted .265 with 53 runs scored, 108 hits, 17 doubles, three triples, three home runs, 52 RBIs, and five stolen bases in 110 games played. In the field, Haslin played 87 games at shortstop, 11 games at third base, and nine games at second base. Haslin joined the Philadelphia Phillies for spring training in Florida during the start of the 1936 season. After playing 16 games with the Phillies during the regular season, Haslin was traded to the Boston Bees in exchange for Pinky Whitney. He batted .344 with six runs scored, 22 hits, one doubles, one triple, and six RBIs in 16 games played with the Phillies, while playing 12 games at second base, and five games at third defensively. After his trade, the Bees manager, Bill McKechnie, suspended Haslin after he refused to report to the team until his demand of a higher salary was met. On May 15, he agreed to new contract terms and reported to the Boston club. On July 4, in a game against the New York Giants, Haslin hit two home runs. With Boston, he batted .279 with 14 runs scored, 29 hits, one doubles, two triples, two home runs, 11 RBIs in 36 games played. In the field, he played 17 games at third base, and seven games at second base. During the off-season before the 1937 season, the Boston Bees traded Haslin to the New York Giants in exchange for Eddie Mayo. At the start of the 1937 season, Haslin was competing against Lou Chiozza, and Tommy Thevenow for the starting third baseman job. With the Giants that season, he batted .190 with eight runs scored, eight hits, one double, and five RBIs in 27 games played. He played nine games at shortstop, four games at second base, and four games at third base, defensively. In July, the Giants sent Haslin to the minor leagues. Major league scouts Bill Essick of the Cleveland Indians, and Eddie Herr of the New York Yankees watched Haslin make his debut in the minors that year with the Kansas City Blues to decide if he would be a good fit for their organizations. In 40 games in the minors that year, he batted .299 with 43 hits, eight doubles, three triples, and two home runs. In the field, Haslin played 28 games at shortstop. Haslin began the 1938 season with the New York Giants. On May 23, Haslin was at-bat during the sixth inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates when he hit a pitch from Pirates' starter Mace Brown, which went directly back to Brown and struck him in the ribs. After the Giants received Alex Kampouris in a trade from the Cincinnati Reds in June, Haslin was sent-down to the minor league Jersey City Giants of the Double-A International League. In the minors, he batted .310 with 122 hits, 17 doubles, seven triples, and five home runs in 101 games played. Defensively, he played all of his 101 games at second base. In September that year, Haslin was called up to play with the Giants for the remainder of the season. On September 22, Haslin hit two home runs in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. The final game of Haslin's major league career would come on October 2, in a game against the Boston Bees. On the season with New York, Haslin batted .324 with 33 hits, three doubles, three home runs, and 15 RBIs in 31 games played. He played 15 games at third base, and 13 games at second base that year. On December 7, 1938, Haslin was traded by the New York Giants to the minor league San Diego Padres of the Double-A Pacific Coast League in exchange for Manny Salvo. The trade was originally intended to have two players go to the Padres, but San Diego's president Spider Baum agreed to take Haslin after he hear from baseball executives around the majors that he would \\"be lucky to land [him]\\". However, Haslin's tenure with the Padres started out rough after he failed to report to spring training until his demand of a higher salary was met. On March 18, Haslin joined the Padres, signing a contract worth US$600 a month, a third less than his original asking price of the US$900 a month. It was not the last of Haslin's issues that year, because after a game on May 10, he got into an argument with San Diego manager Cedric Durst over a matter Durst called \\"unimportant\\" and Haslin left the team's stadium. After the ordeal, Durst suspended Haslin and fined him US$100. During a game on June 25, against the Oakland Oaks, Haslin hit two home runs and drove in all the Padres runs leading them to a 5‚Äìto‚Äì2 victory. With the Padres that season, Haslin batted .345 with 185 hits, 29 doubles, five triples, and 11 home runs in 151 games played. In the field, he played all of his games at third base. At the start of the 1940 season, Haslin refused a contract with the San Diego Padres, and held-out for what he hoped would be a better offer. On March 12, Padres president Charles Mel Lott called Haslin at his home in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to alert him that the San Diego would only wait ten more days for him to sign a contract for the 1940 season, or else they would release him. On March 25, two-days past Lott's ten-day window for Haslin to sign, he returned to San Diego to meet with Padres executives. Haslin reportedly asked Lott for a trade in that meeting. He also threatened to retire from baseball if he did not receive a higher salary. He reported to spring training on March 26, but was still unsigned. Haslin eventually signed with San Diego and played with them for the entire season. On the season, he batted .321 with 198 hits, 43 doubles, two triples, and nine home runs in 164 games played. Haslin played all of his games at third base. He was fourth in the Pacific Coast League in doubles that season. Haslin reported to the San Diego Padres during spring training on March 3, 1940 . He was selected to play in the Pacific Coast League All-Star Game as a utility player that season. On the season, he batted .301 with 65 runs scored, 138 hits, 27 doubles, three triples, five home runs, 75 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases in 125 games played. In the field, he played exclusively at third base. At the start of the 1942 season, Haslin filed to report to spring training with the Padres, again seeking a higher salary. San Diego president Charles Mel Lott then traded Haslin to the Double-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League in exchange for John Hill. With Toronto that year, Haslin played just two games, getting one hit in five at-bats. He had to sit out the majority of the season with a leg injury, which he had surgery for during the off-season. In February 1943, Haslin was traded from the Toronto Maple Leafs to the Double-A Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. With the Indians that season, he batted .239 with 32 runs scored, 89 hits, 13 doubles, three triples, one home run, and 50 RBIs. He played second, and third base, defensively. After the season, Haslin was purchased by the Double-A Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association, but never made an appearance. Later life After his baseball career, Haslin served in World War II as a Private in the United States Army. Haslin died on March 7, 2002 at the age of 92 in his home-town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He was buried at Saint Mary's Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre.

In an attempt to understand the origin of atoms, Georges Lema√Ætre proposed (by 1927) that before the expansion of the universe started all the matter in the universe, it formed a gigantic ball of nuclear liquid at very low temperature. This low temperature was required to provide an adequate cohesion within the Lema√Ætre's primeval atom. In 1966, David Layzer proposed a variant on Lema√Ætre's cosmology in which the initial state of the universe was near absolute zero. Layzer argued that, rather than in an initial high entropy state, the primordial universe was in a very low entropy state near absolute zero.

History The structure was not originally a manor, but a combination of a parochial house for the parish priest and an overnight hostel on the Vesela Gora pilgrimage route. It was built in 1768, on the site of an earlier, smaller parochial house. After Vesela Gora ceased to be a pilgrimage destination in 1782, the building lost its purpose. In 1825 it was acquired by the noble family of Barbo, who converted it into a residence and thereby gave it its current name. It remained in their possession until 1938, when it was bought by Winzor Edeltrant. In 1942 the manor was partially burned, and its interior furnishings partially looted. After the Second World War the building was nationalized and partially restored. In 1974, its ground floor was turned into an ethnological museum. In 1984, the local ≈†entrupert‚ÄìMirna apiculture society set up a pair of memorial rooms in the first floor dedicated to two local historical figures, the apiarist and doctor Aleksander Lunaƒçek and the priest and art patron Peter Pavel Glavar.Du≈°an ≈†tepec, Conservator for ZVKDS OE Novo Mesto Architecture The manor has a partial basement and is entirely built of stone, except for the roof.

The longer side of the building is partially dug into the slope; a staircase protruding from the northwestern side connects the basement, ground floor, first floor, and attic. The building was given its present appearance in 1768; the year is carved over the main entrance. The exterior stonework is unstuccoed. All four sides have evenly spaced windows in stone frames. The basement features a large, vaulted wine cellar. Across a courtyard from the manor there is an outbuilding with a vaulted stable.

The album has produced \\"Beautiful Girl\\", \\"Please Be Careful with My Heart\\", \\"My Girl, My Woman, My Friend\\" and \\"I Have Fallen in Love (With the Same Woman Three Times)\\". Later in June 1991, it belatedly won the Awit Award for Album of the Year. It was also declared the first ever album in the Philippines to reach the Diamond status by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI), and is currently the second biggest-selling album in the Philippines with sales of over 800,000 units in the country. According to the Manila Standard, Constant Change also became the most popular foreign album in Indonesia by July 1990. The album was later made available on digital download through iTunes. Background Chan was in his twenty-second year as a recording artist when Universal released Constant Change. He described the history of the title track's composition in the following statement: > ‚ÄúI wrote \\"Constant Change\\" while making the transition from living in New > York back to Manila. I was on a plane looking at the clouds pass swiftly by, > changing form faster than the wink of an eye. The song reflects the > ‚Äòfrightening pace at which we live our days‚Äô ‚Äî you know, constantly changing > ‚Äòlike clouds that move across the skies,‚Äô reminding us to maintain our sense > of childlike wonder and simplicity before we ‚Äògrow too old for tales of > knights‚Äô and ‚Äòlosing our Peter Pan and wings.‚Äô Throughout the ‚Äò90s, many > high-school classes adopted \\"Constant Change\\" as graduation theme song.‚Äù Composition \\"I Have Fallen in Love (With the Same Woman Three Times) is a poem written by Ninoy Aquino for his wife, President Cory Aquino. Chan incorporated music with the poem to make it a song. According to Chan, \\"Sing Me Your Song Again, Daddy\\" is played during wedding receptions as young brides dance with their fathers up to now. \\"Beautiful Girl\\" inspired the Seiko movie of the same title, starring Gretchen Barretto. Chan narrated the story behind the song, saying \\"It‚Äôs about a pretty girl I saw from a distance but never got to meet. She was like a fragment of a lovely melody that comes to a songwriter in the dark of night, only to lose it at the break of day\\".

It is the type species among ~150 species of Clerodendrum. It is one of the most well-known natural health remedies in traditional practices and siddha medicine. The species is native to tropical regions of Asia including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Andaman Islands, and Sri Lanka.Jayaweera DMA (982). Medicinal Plants (Indigenous and Exotic) Used in Ceylon Part V. The National Science Council of Sri Lanka, Colombo, pp. 160-161 Description Clerodendrum infortunatum is a flowering shrub or small tree, and is so named because of its rather ugly leaf. The stem is erect, high, with no branches and produce circular leaves with diameter. Leaves are simple, opposite; both surfaces sparsely villous- pubescent, elliptic, broadly elliptic, ovate or elongate ovate, wide, long, dentate, inflorescence in terminal, peduncled, few-flowered cyme; flowers white with purplish pink or dull-purple throat, pubescent. Fruit berry, globose, turned bluish-black or black when ripe, enclosed in the red accrescent fruiting-calyx. The stem is hollow and the leaves are long, borne in whorls of four on very short petioles. The inflorescence is huge, consisting of many tubular snow white flowers in a terminal cluster up to long. The tubes of the flowers are about long and droop downward, and the expanded corollas are about across. The fruits are attractive dark metallic blue drupes, about in diameter. Fruit usually with four dry nutlets and the seeds may be with or without endosperm. It flowers from April to August. Chemical constituents The major compounds are sterols, sugars, flavonoids and saponins. Novel crystalline compounds such as clerodolone, clerodone, clerodol, and a sterol designated clerosterol have been isolated from the root. Seven sugars namely raffinose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, galactose, glucose and fructose were identified. Fumaric acid, caffeic acid esters, Œ≤-sitosterol and Œ≤-sitosterol glucoside were isolated from the flowers. Apigenin, acacetin and a new flavone glycoside, characterised as the methyl ester of acacetin-7-0-glucuronide are isolated from the flowers. Saponin is one of the major compounds of the leaf. 24 beta-ethylsterols, clerosterol and 22-dehydroclerosterol, 24-methyl-sterols (24-methylcholestanol, 24-methylcholesterol, 24-methyl-22-dehydrocholesterol, and 24-methyllathostero) and 24 beta-ethyl-22-dehydrocholestanol are found in the seeds. Scutellarin and hispidulin-7-O-glucuronide are present in the leaf. Poriferasterol and stigmasterol are the components of the aerial parts. Traditional herbal medicine Clerodendrum infortunatum is used in Ayurvedic and Siddha traditional medicines. Fresh leaves are given for diarrhea, liver disorders, and headache. The leaf and root are used as antidandruff, antipyretic, ascaricide, laxative, vermifuge, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic, and for gravel, malaria, scabies, skin diseases, sores, spasm, scorpion sting, snake bite, and tumors.Duke JA (2010).

Construction began on a 75-acre site, west of San Ysidro in the Tijuana River Valley. The project, authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1989 and formally agreed between the two countries in July 1990, was part of a regional approach to solve long-standing problems, particularly the flow of sewage-contaminated water into the ocean via the Tijuana River. Completed in spring 1997, the official ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on April 18 and the plant came properly on-line in May. The International Wastewater Treatment Plant was created in an effort to mitigate pollution caused by untreated sewage coming from the city of Tijuana. The U.S. paid for the majority of the treatment plant, citing the sewage runoff as an international issue. It required the cooperation of multiple governmental bodies. Even though most of the plant's raw sewage comes from Tijuana, it is owned by the U.S. portion of the International Boundary and Water Commission, an agreement between Mexico and the US that helps delineate border lines and allocate water flow from the rivers and other bodies of water that intermingle between the U.S. and Mexico. Due to the rapid growth Tijuana has experienced, failures of the sewer infrastructure were frequent. Mexico did not have the money to fund a large treatment plant to deal with this issue, so the U.S., specifically the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), helped to fund the project. The rationale for this was that due to the proximity of Tijuana to San Diego, and the fact that the sewage flow often causes the closure of U.S. beaches due to bacterial contamination of the water, it was warranted for both municipalities and government bodies to contribute to funding. The project cost the U.S. a total of $239 million initially, and the addition of secondary treatment technology that helped meet regulations so the water could flow to the U.S. side of the border cost an additional $18 million. Currently, the treatment plant supports a daily flow of 25 million gallons of raw sewage per day. Ultimately, this agreement made strides to increase the availability of clean drinking water in Tijuana and helped to ensure that pollution and degradation to the surrounding environment was minimized.

Career McElcheran began modeling portraits as a boy at the age of 10. When he was 16, he was granted an advanced second-year standing at the Ontario College of Art where he studied until 1948, receiving training as a carpenter and designer. During his time at the College, he earned a painting scholarship, and upon graduating at the top of his class in 1948, was awarded the Lieutenant-Governor's Medal. In the mid-fifties, he was employed by Bruce Brown and Brisely Architects in Toronto as a liturgical designer. During his employment, he became their lead designer for church and university buildings, and made a significant impact on architectural interior design. In 1958, he played a major role in the development of McMaster Divinity College and Chapel, contributing sculptures in stone and wood to the interior. McElcheran began sculpting in the early sixties with wood, and later used bronze and other materials. After 1970, McElcheran started work on his pieces The Crowd, The (Rat) Race and Businessman, for display in Canadian cities. He continued to develop themes of futility and corporatization in his sculptures until his death. In 1973, McElcheran submitted Truth-Duty‚ÄìValour (1976), two variations in the pose of a 24' cast bronze standing sculpture of a cadet, as a centennial gift from the RMC Club to the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Numbered, limited-edition, 12\\" bronze statuettes known as Brucie were sold as a fund-raising effort.

As with the previous two Mario & Sonic titles, it was published by Nintendo in Japan and by Sega in all other regions. The game is officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia. It is the third installment in the Mario & Sonic series after the commercial success of its predecessors and is an official video game of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. The game was released on the Wii on November 15, 2011 in North America, November 17, 2011 in Australia, November 18, 2011 in Europe, and December 8, 2011 in Japan. It was also released for the Nintendo 3DS in February 2012. The game is the first, and the only one to come in a yellow keep case instead of a standard white case, similar to how New Super Mario Bros. Wii was the only game to have a red keep case. The Wii version, like the original 2007 Olympic Games version, does not support the Balance Board; the 2009 Winter Olympics version does. Mario & Sonic on the Wii and 3DS is a collection of numerous events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Mario or Sonic character while competing against the others in these events. The game received mixed reviews from critics. A fourth game in the series, Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, was released in November 2013 for the Wii U. Gameplay Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games is a collection of numerous events based on the Olympic Games. Mario & Sonic brings together the two title characters and eighteen more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill A recent interview revealed that the same characters are playable as the previous game, with more focus being put on the events and gameplay. Several Olympic events on the Wii, including football (soccer), badminton, and equestrian will debut alongside improved versions of previously existing events such as athletics, aquatics, and table tennis. The Wii game introduced new \\"Dream Events\\", which are alternate versions of Olympic events taking place in locations from older games of the Mario and Sonic series. The Wii version also introduces new cooperative mechanics and a Party mode. The 3DS version has 57 Olympic-based events in single-player and multiplayer. It also contains an exclusive \\"Story Mode\\" which entails the characters from Mario and Sonic's worlds working against the antagonists, who are trying to use fog machines to prevent the games from being held. Development The first game in the series, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, is the first official crossover title to feature characters from both Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog's franchises. The Olympic Games were chosen as a setting since Sega and Nintendo felt its competitive sportsmanship was ideal for the once-rival mascots Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. Sean Ratcliffe, vice president of marketing at Sega of America commented on whether the Mario & Sonic series had a future past its second installment, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. He said, \\"I think the key factor that decides the ongoing building of this franchise is basically success. Is the game successful? Are consumers happy with it?\\" A sequel was officially announced with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on April 21, 2011, after its predecessors sold over 19 million units combined. It is an official video game of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and is licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia. Early in its software developmental stages, a peripheral was considered to launch alongside the game. Both versions were developed by Sega Sports Japan and are published by Nintendo for Japan and by Sega for North America, and Europe. According to gaming magazine CVG, over 100 people developed the game. It was released on the Wii on November 15, 2011 in North America, November 17, 2011 in Australia and New Zealand, November 18, 2011 in Europe and December 8, 2011 in Japan; and was released on the Nintendo 3DS handheld system in February 2012 in North America and PAL Regions and March 2012 in Japan. A demo of the 3DS version was made available for download on the Nintendo eShop on January 26, 2012. Nintendo re-released the Nintendo 3DS version of the game as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop, available on November 1, 2012 in Japan, on May 30, 2013 in the PAL regions, and on June 20, 2013 in North America. It was later removed from the eShop in all regions. =Music= Both versions of the game feature various musical tracks from the Mario and Sonic series arranged by various members of Sega's Sega Digital Studio group. Original music was written for the game, with both versions mostly sharing the same soundtrack. Reception The game received mixed reception, with Metacritic giving both versions 66/100. IGN gave the Wii version 7.5, stating \\"The only great parts of Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games are the parts that have nothing to do with the Olympics.

Founded in 1932 by Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a, the factory was \\"one of the most important planned landscapes in the East of England\\" in the 20th century. The factory closed in 2005. Background Bata Shoes was founded in 1894 by Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a in Zl√≠n (then Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the Czech Republic). After the plea of a Tilbury clergyman to alleviate unemployment during the Great Depression and in part to overcome customs tariffs on foreign products, construction began in 1932 on the Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. For the remaining years of the 20th century, the factory was an economic force in the Tilbury area. Designed by Czech architect, it created a unique model of a Company town in Britain. Bata's vision was for a whole society, complete with worker housing, schools for their children, and entertainment. Architecture In 1933 the first \\"Bata houses\\" for workers were built, set among gardens in a chequerboard pattern, which were distinct from the more typical Victorian terraced housing in the area. The factory's architecture \\"predates\\" and \\"perhaps eclipses\\" other British examples of modernist architecture, such as Highpoint I or the Isokon building, according to The Guardian. Designed by Jan Kotƒõra and other Czech architects, the estate's buildings were constructed of welded steel columns, roof trusses and reinforced concrete walls - very different in style from the typical red-bricked and sloped-roofed terraces of London suburbs. All the social needs of the workforce were met by the factory. What was known as \\"Bata-ville\\" had all the services of a normal town, including a theatre, sports facilities, hotel, restaurant, grocery and butcher shops, post office, and its own newspaper. The Czech architects Franti≈°ek Lydie Gahura and Vladim√≠r Karf√≠k were among those who designed the buildings on the site. The disused factory in 2006 World War II The German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 caused turmoil for Bata Shoes generally, but the factory in East Tilbury thrived. \\"British Bata\\" was born. As male factory workers were called to arms, their wives often took over their jobs. While in the armed forces, employees received the company newspaper, the Bata Record, along with food and cigarette parcels. At least 81 Bata employees from the Tilbury factory died in the war. After the war, Bata's home office in Czechoslovakia and other facilities throughout eastern Europe were nationalised by communist regimes. Latter years and demise Bata Shoe Works in 2005 The Bata factory in East Tilbury operated for more than 70 years, but in the 1960s, production was gradually shifted to facilities closer to its export markets. Factory downsizing began in the 1980s, and the Bata industrial estate was closed in 2005. \\"The East Tilbury (Bata) Conservation Area\\" was designated in 1993 by Thurrock Council and includes a Grade II listed building. Legacy The factory inspired the documentary film Bata-ville: We Are Not Afraid of the Future.Road film follows shoe empire\\", BBC News, 28 August 2005https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0495576/ The Bata Reminiscence and Resource Centre at East Tilbury Library was set up to collect the memories of people who lived and worked within the British Bata community. In June 2011, an interactive trail was launched as an iPhone app known as Thurrock Mobile Explorer. This describes a route around the Bata estate and provides information about the history as well as environment at numbered points.\\"Interactive trails to launch at Coalhouse Fort\\", Thurrock Gazette In October 2016, a site-specific play, Not Afraid Of The Future, was developed by East 15 Acting School students about the lives of people who lived and worked in the town surrounding the factory. The play was performed in and around East Tilbury, finishing at the village hall. Notable people Jan T≈Ø≈°a, the father of BBC journalist and presenter John Tusa, helped design and build the Tilbury factory. He became managing director of the British Bata company. The Tusa family lived in nearby Horndon on the Hill, from 1939; John Tusa was born in Czechoslovakia.Lecture by John Tusa See also *Bata Shoe Museum *Bata Shoes *Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a *Svatopluk Turek Notes External links *English Heritage Historic Area Appraisal *Bata Shoes corporate history page *Bata Reminiscence and Resource Centre *Home Guard practice at the Bata factory *University of Essex lecture Shoemakers to the world: The Bata estate on the Essex marshes, 1939‚Äì1960 *Financial Times obituary for Thomas Bata *Bata- ville: We Are Not Afraid Of The Future (film) *Nearly identical Bata factory in Maryland, USA Bata Corporation Grade II listed buildings in Essex Buildings and structures in Essex Buildings and structures in Thurrock Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Shoe factories Buildings and structures completed in 1932 ","title":"Bata shoe factory"},{"id":"31553865","text":"Veronaea is a genus of ascomycete fungi, which manifest as brownish colonies.

The magazine features characters from the television series, and emphasizes Sesame Streets educational goals. The intended audience includes children under the age of five and their parents. Sesame Workshop (formerly called the Children's Television Workshop) published the magazine from October 1970 to 2001. The Parenting Group then assumed publication, and until 2008 distributed it optionally to subscribers of Parenting. Since 2008 the Parenting Group has distributed Sesame Street Magazine electronically and without charge. The Parents' Choice Foundation commended Sesame Street Magazine with the Parents' Choice Award on 18 occasions between 1970 and 2007. Features In 1985, publisher Nina Link decided to incorporate a parents' guide into the magazine. However, the concept developed into a companion magazine called the Sesame Street Parents Guide. The intent of the supplement was to explain the themes of each issue to parents so that they understand what their children can learn from the magazine. Subscribers received both publications. While Sesame Street Magazine did not carry third-party advertising, the Parents Guide did. Both the parent magazine and the children's magazine are meant to complement the show. Every year, Children's Television Workshop developed new curriculum goals to apply to both the show and the magazine. For example, if the show addressed issues about the environment, the magazine did too. According to the guidelines laid out by Nina Link, publisher of the magazine from 1978 to 1999, and Ren√©e Cherow-O‚ÄôLeary, Director of Research for the Magazine Group of the Children's Television workshop from 1989 to 1995: The purpose of the magazine is to foster skills in pre-reading, writing, mathematics, and socialization. Just as the effect of the Sesame Street television show on children was continually evaluated in laboratory settings, the magazine issues were as well. The goal of Children's Television Workshop is to combine education with entertainment. Thus, just like in the show, the magazine features stories centered around such characters as Big Bird and Cookie Monster, as well as engaging colors.Children‚Äôs Television Workshop.

Subscription price was $6.95 for one year and newsstand price was 75 cents. One year subscription included 10 issues per year. In 1990, the magazine's circulation was at a high of 1,200,000 million. Subscription price was $14.95 for one year (still 10 issues) and newsstand price was $1.50. Subscriptions at this time included the Parent's Guide, but the guide was not sold in newsstands. Another 51,000 copies of the two magazines were sent free by the publisher to pediatricians' offices. In 1999, the magazine's paid circulation for the first six months of the year (January 1 to June 30) was 1,148,432 with an additional unpaid circulation of 16,224, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations and BPA International figures.http://adage.com/datacenter/datapopup.php?article_id=106284 In 2000, the magazine's circulation numbers dropped by 2.9 percent when compared to the 1999 circulation numbers.

The screenplay concerns a wealthy socialite who tries to gain custody of her orphaned nieces. Plot Susan Fletcher (Miriam Hopkins) and her millionaire father, Simon (Henry Stephenson), are eager to take care of her late sister's two daughters, Joan and Katie, but her deceased brother-in-law's will placed them in the custody of his brother, John O'Halloran (Ray Milland). Mr. Fletcher's lawyers inform him that there is nothing they can do, unless John can be shown to be unemployed. However, though he loses jobs frequently, he also seems to be able to find new ones just as quickly. Susan decides to investigate. She passes herself off as an impoverished actress and talks John's kindly landlord into giving her a place to stay. She becomes acquainted with John, a struggling painter, the two girls, and their friends, boxer/sculptor Mike Malloy (Guinn Williams) and harmless alcoholic Karl Stevens (Walter Abel). Susan and John begin to fall in love, but when Susan tries to help him out, it only seems to lose him all of his jobs. When she informs her father of these developments, he is delighted. Despite her protests, he has the authorities pick up the two girls for a custody hearing. John learns of Susan's real identity, and assumes she is in on the plot. As John is now out of work, the girls are given to the Fletchers. When it becomes clear to Susan that they are desperately unhappy to be away from John, she tells them they can go home. However, when they find her weeping over the whole mess, they agree that her plan to keep them so that John will have time to paint is a good one, and agree to stay. Stubborn, John rejects Susan's suggestion that he enter a painting contest with a large prize of money. Susan gets the police to put John in jail on trumped up charges, and sees to it that he gets no food unless he paints. He finally caves in, then paints an unflattering caricature of her and her father. To his surprise, Susan is delighted with the work and arranges to sell it for a large sum. When John is released, he realizes that Susan is looking out for his welfare, and the couple reconcile.

It comprises three or sometimes more aircraft flying in close formation with the leader at the apex and the rest of the flight en echelon to left and right, the whole resembling the letter \\"V\\". The name is derived from the term for the letter V in the phonetic alphabet of the time. It is still in use today, though it has been superseded or replaced in some circumstances. History At the start of the First World War little thought had been given to the most efficient formations to use for military aircraft. Groups of fliers (drawn from the various nations Army or Navy) would fly in columns, or line ahead, as if they were troops of cavalry or flotillas of ships. This was soon found to be inefficient, for several reasons. First, the leaders were unable to communicate with their squadrons, and they with him, other than the vague instruction to follow the leader. Second, if they came under anti-aircraft fire from the ground, the flight would either all turn at once, scattering the formation, or they would follow the leader round a point, as horsemen or ships, maintaining cohesion but being exposed to fire on a fixed point. The remedy was to fly in a close V formation, allowing the aircraft to make a sudden 180 degree turn if fired upon, which would leave them flying out of danger with the formation intact, though with their positions in the formation reversed.Franks, pp 53‚Äì4 The formation also allowed the fliers to see each other and communicate by hand signals; it also allowed them to stay together in poor visibility or cloud. Later, when bomber and reconnaissance flights came under attack from fighter aircraft, the Vic proved to have good defensive characteristics; pilots, looking inwards to maintain formation could overlook each other for attackers, while their observer/rear gunners could use interlocking fire to protect each other. The Vic was the basic flying formation adopted by every major air force; the French Air Force referred to it as the Chevron, while to the Germans it was the Kette. It remained the standard formation throughout the inter-war years and into World War II. The basic unit was the three plane section, in a Vic; two sections made up a flight, and two flights a squadron. Squadrons would fly in line astern, one Vic behind another, leaving the squadron leader effectively the only person looking for the enemy. Curtiss P.40s in Vic formation At the outbreak of the Second World War the Vic was still in use by both bombers and fighter formations in most air forces; however the Finnish and German air forces fighter units had changed to the more flexible and aggressive pair (Rotte) and four (Schwarm) combination. These comprised a pair (leader and wingman) and four (two pairs) in a ‚Äúfinger- four‚Äù arrangement Luftwaffe pilots were disparaging about the RAF‚Äôs use of the Vic formation during the Battle of Britain, though in practice there was little else Allied pilots could do. Germany, as the aggressor, had the choice of how and when to attack, and, based on their experience during the Spanish Civil War, had changed and developed their tactics accordingly. Fighter Command could only make do until the battle was over before reviewing and making changes. As an interim method, RAF adopted the line astern formation, on which four-plane flights flew following each other. Luftwaffe related to them derisively, calling them Idiotenreihen (‚Äúrows of idiots‚Äù)Holmes p 61 Bob Oxspring, a Pilot Officer in 66 Sqdn, and a future ace, commented: > \\"We knew there was a lot wrong with our tactics during the Battle of Britain > but it was one hell of a time to alter everything we had practiced. We had > not time to experiment when we were in combat three and four times a day. > Moreover we were getting fresh pilots straight out of Flying School who were > trained - barely - to use the old type of close formation ‚Äì they simply > could not have coped with anything radically different.\\"Holmes p 64 In addition, the primary purpose of Fighter Command was to intercept the bombers, who still flew in the defensive Kette; therefore the optimum formation for attacking them was a corresponding three plane Vic, so each fighter would find itself against a different bomber. Price p 25 This was also the conclusion of the Luftwaffe later, when faced with USAAF bombers in their box formations of massed Vics, German pilots reverted to the Kette to tackle them.Spick p 57 Some modifications were made by the RAF within the Vic structure; Pilots learned to open the formation, and the rear-most Vic in a Squadron was tasked with weaving, to improve observation, but casualties amongst the weavers remained high. When the campaign was over Fighter Command experimented with, and adopted, the pair and four arrangement, though these might fly in echelon or in line astern, to aid identification. Douglas Bader, of 242 Sqdn experimented with the finger four arrangement and found it beneficial; by 1941 it was in general use in the RAF.Burns pp 150‚Äì152 Four elements in vic formation comprising a combat box 1942 saw the arrival of the U.S. Army Air Forces, with its strategy of daylight bombing; tight bomber formations relying on massed defensive fire were expected to win through to the target. The most basic formation for bombers was a three-plane \\"V\\" called an \\"element\\". Stacks of these elements were configured to form a defensive bombing formation called the \\"combat box\\". These combat boxes, involving full squadrons, groups or entire wings, could produce huge fire-power and offer mutual support, though casualties were and remained high without fighter escort.

The last circus to use the building was in 1990 History =Construction phase= Ernst Renz At that time, circus tents were relatively uncommon. Instead, touring circus companies performed in permanent venues. They were generally simple wooden structures but in major cities elaborate circus buildings in brick and stone became increasingly common. Ernst Renz, director of Circus Renz and artist who had made a fortune on his trade, had built extravagant circus buildings in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna and Breslau. In Copenhagen he leased the new building on a three-year contract. The first plans envisioned an extravagant building with an elaborate facade with statues and Greek columns but in the end a much simpler design was chosen. The Circus building was designed by the architect Henrik Vilhelm Brinkopff and built from 1885 to 1886 in the area outside the former Western City Gate which was Copenhagen's premier entertainment district with nearby venues such as Tivoli Gardens and National Scala. It was inaugurated by Cirkus Benneweis in 1882. =Early years of running= The Cirkus Building in 1886 The Circus Building was inaugurated on 8 May 1886 but Renz sub-rented the building in 1887 to his German colleague, Albert Schumann the Elder, who, a few years earlier, had opened a circus in the Swedish town of Malm√∂ on the other side of the √òresund. The Cirkus Building photographed by Frederik Riise in circa 1905 Renz did not renew his lease after the 1888 season and died in 1891. Instead the Circus building played host to performances by a variety of visiting foreign circus companies which passed through Copenhagen on their European tours. In March 1914, the Circus building was devastated by a fire which left only the outer walls standing. It was quickly rebuilt, under the direction of the architect Holger Jacobsen, and reopened in 1915 with the German Zirkus Sarrasani as tenant. =Circus Schumann: 1918-1937 and 1943-1969= In 1916, Cirkus Schumann performed in the building. The company was run by Willy, Ernst, and Oscar Schumann, nephews of Albert Schumann, after they had taken over the family business from their father, Max Schumann, the previous year. They returned to the Circus building in 1918 and except for a few years' break during the beginning of World War II performed there every summer until 1968. During that period, their company was synonymous with circus in Denmark, and won a reputation as one of the best in Europe, particularly for equestrian presentations. In 1963, a retail company, Anva, bought the Circus building to replace it with a modern department store but the plans were abandoned after massive protests and due to lack of funding. Still, due to escalating rent and the uncertainty about the building's future, Cirkus Schumann chose to leave the building in 1969. =Cirkus Benneweis era= The Schumanns were succeeded by another prominent Danish circus, Benneweis, headed by Eli Benneweis, presenting summer performances from 1970 to 1990. In 1974, the City bought the building and rented it out to the Benneweis family, who also became responsible for operating the World Cinema during the winter months. In 1988, the Circus building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency. After decreasing ticket sales, Circus Benneweis decided to leave the building in 1990. The building has since been used for a variety of activities and events, including musicals, ballet, conferences and concerts. Architecture The frieze Plan of the building The building is circular and topped by a shallow dome. The most distinctive feature of the facade is a frieze located just below the roof on the periphery of the outer wall. It was created by the sculptor Frederik Hammeleff and survived the fire in 1906. It depicts motifs from ancient Rome and Greece. Today  Since 2003, the building has been leased by Wallmans salonger, a Swedish entertainment company, which uses it for a dinner and entertainment venue. In popular culture The Circus Building is used as a location in the 1973 Olsen-banden film The Olsen Gang Goes Crazy.

Her professional activities include teaching, writing, and a long association with Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine as teacher, student and trustee. Hunter was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on November 13, 1945 to C. McCord Purdy, salesman and magician, and Ruth Gordon Purdy, secretary and untrained artist. She attended Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana where she studied drawing and painting, attaining the BA degree in 1967, and the MFA degree in Textiles in 1971. Professional practice After having taught at Mansfield State College (now Mansfield University) in Mansfield, Pennsylvania from 1971 to 1978, Hunter left Pennsylvania to work as a full-time artist, living in South Berwick, Maine. At the time, she was weaving tapestries but was soon drawn to the burgeoning fields of papermaking and basketry. It was at this time that she developed her own technique of applying paper to her coiled baskets as well as making collages of painted and stitched paper and fabric. Hunter continued these two paths after moving to Portland, Maine in 1984. In 1994, she merged the two- dimensional and three-dimensional imagery into wall-mounted sculptures that remain her trademark work. While she continues in this vein, Hunter also explores drawing, painting and printmaking. She also teaches workshops and writes as a complementary part of her professional life.

It is endemic to El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, growing primarily in the Luquillo Mountains. It is named for the El Toro Trail in the mountains. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.  Habitat  El Yunque National Park Lepanthes eltoroensis grows at six sites of sierra palm, palo colorado, and dwarf forest areas within the Luquillo Mountains. Because the orchid is an epiphyte (living on other plants without parasitizing), L. eltoroensis finds its home on the trunks of several species of trees, known also to house mosses and liverworts. The orchid has only been found on approximately 40-60 trees within the forest, all at an altitude of 2,789 ft or above. More recent studies have noted larger populations of L. eltoroensis on the Tradewinds Trail as opposed to the El Toro Trail, for which it was named, possibly due to greater numbers of Sierra palm, offering a more closed canopy. Sierra Palm Tree Physical characteristics  The plant is no more than 4 centimeters long with a single leaf and three-seven slender stems. Eltoroensis stands apart from its genus of Lepanthes orchids due to its comparatively long inflorescence, obovate leaves ( 0.4-0.9 in long x 0.2-0.4 in wide) and ciliate sepals. The solitary flowers with red/orange petals (two lobed petals; three lobed lip) lie against the leaf and are just a few millimeters long. Growth and life-cycle patterns  The lepanthes eltoroensis grows in a circular pattern, favoring the northwestern side of the bole of its phorophyte (host) trees. The average L. eltoroensis will live for about 5.2 years, depending on various factors. Researchers have not yet found the pollinator specific to L. eltoroensis, but other lepanthes species attract black winged fungus gnats. Based on restricted gene flow, small population sizes and high genetic variance between lepanthes species, researchers believe the eltoroensis and others arose through genetic drift.  Endangered status and threats  This plant was listed as an endangered species because it is threatened by forest management practices and hurricane activity. Plant collectors have sought this plant, and have destroyed at least one population of it once found in the sierra palm forest.  Conservation Diversity within the L. eltoroensis species is low, limiting the potential for adaptive development, and jeopardizing the success of the populations. Researchers have suggested the artificial cross-pollination of the L. eltoroensis and L. caritensis (which suffers from similar genetic restrictions) in order to combat the homogeneity of genetic material. Additionally, because of L. eltorensis' compatibility with multiple species for phorophytes, survival success is expected to be higher compared to other Lepanthes, and relocation more accessible/promising.

Symphony No. 1 for Orchestra. New York: G. Schirmer Inc. Composition Prior to this work, Corigliano had ‚Äúlong resisted the notion of a contemporary symphony ... for what he felt was its egotistical elevation of the composer‚Äôs need to express himself over the needs of the performer or audiences‚Äù.Adamo, Mark. John Corigliano: A Monograph. Todmorden: Arc Music, 2000. However, the loss of numerous friends due to the emerging AIDS pandemic brought Corigliano to use the symphonic form not as a means of personal expression but to commemorate ‚Äú‚Äòmy friends ‚Äì those I had lost and the one I was losing‚Äô‚Äù. Inspired in part by the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, the symphony seeks to memorialize friends and colleagues in Corigliano‚Äôs life. The first three movements are dedicated to three individuals: a pianist, a music executive, and a cellist. The finale depicts the piano solo, the tarantella melody, and the cello solo from the first three movements against a backdrop of ‚Äúa repeated pattern consisting of waves of brass chords ... [to convey] an image of timelessness‚Äù. Form \\"Apologue: Of Rage and Remembrance\\" is the first of the four movements in Symphony No. 1 and written in a loose A-B-A form that \\"alternates between the tension of anger and the bittersweet nostalgia of remembering\\". The movement opens with \\"the nasal open A of the violins and violas\\" and explores the different timbres of that note by being played on different strings while varying the speed of vibrato as the note \\"grows in intensity and volume until it is answered by a burst of percussion\\". This then ushers in the entrance of the orchestra in cacophonous overlapping passages of various woodwind and brass instruments. The piece intensifies with increasing dynamic and tempo to a climax, from which the violins take over in the very upper range of their register, thus beginning the B section. As the violins descend, in a calmer and more peaceful mood, an offstage piano enters with Leopold Godowsky's transcription of Isaac Alb√©niz's Tango in D ‚Äì a tribute to Corigliano's pianist-friend. The lyrical melody, first played by solo woodwind instruments and then by strings, carries a much more nostalgic mood. The ‚Äúchattering brass motives‚Äù from the A section begin to reappear for increasing lengths of time until it takes over, thus bringing the end of this section. The dissonant motives accumulate with increasing speed until the orchestra reaches a standstill with loud, repeating dissonant chords played by the entire ensemble, pulsating for long stretches of time. These pulses eventually diminuendo with a lower frequency to a piano. A recapitulation of the motives from the beginning of the piece reach a final climax to conclude the movement, as the strings linger on a high A.

The work served as the inspiration for the sculpture made by Ghada Amer in 2001. The book The Encyclopedia of Pleasure contains the book Jawami' al- ladhdha, which described erotic gay and lesbian love. It quotes and refers to several named and unnamed poets, writers, philosophers and physicians. One of the most famous and more frequently cited writers was Abu Nuwas. Some consider him to be \\"the father of Arab erotic poetry\\". The book contains an account of a 2nd-century Greek physician that was recorded by medieval Arab writers. The physician examined his daughter, who was a lesbian, and concluded that her sexuality was \\"due to 'an itch between the labia majora and minora' that could be soothed only by rubbing them against another woman's labia\\". The author then attempts to find a scientific explanation for lesbianism: \\"Lesbianism is due to a vapor which, condensed, generates in the labia heat and an itch which only dissolve and become cold through friction and orgasm. When friction and orgasm take place, the heat turns into coldness because the liquid that a woman ejaculates in lesbian intercourse is cold whereas the same liquid that results from sexual union with men is hot. Heat, however, cannot be extinguished by heat; rather, it will increase since it needs to be treated by its opposite. As coldness is repelled by heat, so heat is also repelled by coldness\\". One of the stories told in the book is a story about the first Arab lesbian Hind Bint al-Khuss al-Iyadiyyah, known as al-Zarqa‚Äô, and her love for the Christian woman Hind Bint al-Nu\`man, who was the daughter of the last Lakhmid king of Hira in the 7th century. When Hind Bint al-Khuss al-Iyadiyyah died, her faithful lover \\"cropped her hair, wore black clothes, rejected worldly pleasures, vowed to God that she would lead an ascetic life until she passed away‚Ä¶\\" She even built a monastery to commemorate her love for al- Zarqa'. The Arabic version of the medieval text was originally published in Damascus as a part of Adab al-jins 'inda al-'Arab (The Erotic Writings of the Arabs). It is now difficult to find, and most extant copies are missing the chapters that deal with homosexuality. The omissions make the book difficult for many readers to understand. The English translation of the original Arabic version is much easier to find in Europe than in the Arab world. The sculpture Ghada Amer was fascinated with the fact that the Encyclopedia of Pleasure was widely accepted at the time it was written but was later forbidden in the Arab world. She has noted that although the book was written as a moral guide and combined the \\"literary, philosophical and medical knowledge\\" of the Islamic Golden Age was later \\"suppressed by conservative society\\". As Amer puts it: In 2001 Amer produced a large sculptural installation inspired by the Encyclopedia. She used an English translation of the book to place the text from the chapters that deal with female pleasure and beauty \\"On praiseworthy aesthetic qualities of women\\" and \\"On the advantages of a non-virgin over a virgin\\" on \\"57 canvas boxes, covered with Roman script embroidered in gold thread and stacked in various arrangements.\\" The artist chose to blur some words and even some entire passages. She intentionally did this because she believes that \\"the text of these passages is not important per se but acts merely as the visual framework for larger investigations of sexuality and spirituality and the role of the word within them.\\" In her work Amer quoted several sexually explicit texts: By using such quotes, Amer demonstrated that in medieval Muslim society the women were not as \\"sexually repressed\\" as in the present time, and that their opinions on sexuality mattered. A team of men and women constructed the sculpture in Egypt. On 23 March 2007 it was used as a part of Global Feminism exhibit at the Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum in New York.

Oklahoma closed to within 31‚Äì24, but a Donnie Carona field goal and a touchdown pass from Doege to Oklahoma native Tramain Swindall built Texas Tech's lead back to 41‚Äì24. The Sooners added two late touchdowns, but tailback Aaron Crawford recovered Oklahoma's desperation onside kick attempt with time running out, and the Red Raiders were able to run out the clock for the win.

The original school, located on the corner of Sullivan and Wellesley, was built with the capability to house approximately 600 students. This facility served students from 1960‚Äì1989. A bond issue passed by voters in 1986 provided funding for a remodel of the original facility. While many portions of the 1960 building still stand, the 10 million dollar expansion created a new facility designed to support more than 1,600 students. Opening in 1989, the new high school has provided many years of service to its students and community. =Clubs and extracurricular activities= Clubs offered at EVHS include Key Club, DECA, FBLA, National Honor Society, Spanish Club, French Club, Drama, American Sign Language Club, LINK (a leadership group which accommodates and supports underclassmen and new students), Booster Club, and Knowledge Bowl. =Notable achievements = In the spring of 2014, the school's Knowledge Bowl team placed first in the Regional competition and second in the 2A division in Arlington, WA in the state tournament.

Before the game, the school has a spirit week to promote the game and pride. It's a tradition at East Valley that one of the spirit days be \\"Geeky Eagle Day\\" as a satirical celebration of the friendly rivalry between schools. The last school day before the game, there is an assembly to teach students cheers pertaining to the theme, preview performances, introduce the ASB officers as characters from said theme, and encourage crowd etiquette. The venue varies between one of the school's gymnasiums depending on the year. The competition traditionally consists of two basketball games (one with the girls' varsity team and one with the boys') with themed skits that incorporates the school's clubs, faculty, and student leadership, and feature performances from the cheerleaders in between quarters and at halftime. Both schools also organize community dances in which their students and faculty go to the gym floor and participate in a flash mob-like routine. The points scored in the games do not determine the victor of the competition, as it is based on school spirit, crowd participation, and good sportsmanship. After the game, the hosting school has a mixer no matter the outcome, and both West Valley and East Valley students are welcome to attend.

She received an M.A. degree in psychology from Stanford in 1963, and a Ph.D., also in psychology, from Ohio State University in 1965. Kiesler has broad interests in the design and social impact of computing ranging from computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperative work to human-robot interaction. In her early studies with Lee Sproull and her colleagues and students, she examined how computer networking changed group dynamics and social interaction. Their influential 1992 book, Connections Sproull, L., & Kiesler, S. B. (1991). Connections: New ways of working in the networked organization. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press. described the indirect, secondary effects of using email in organizations. Through field observations and experiments they demonstrated the influence of computer-mediated communication phenomena such as status equalization, personal connections and flaming. Research with Robert E. Kraut from the 1990s showed that everyday use of the Internet increased users' depression and decreased their social connections. Later research showed that the psychological consequences of Internet use depend fundamentally on how it is used: communication with friends and family online has positive psychological consequences, while communication with strangers has negative effects. Her ongoing projects include studies of collaboration and virtual organization in science, of collaborative analysis online, of the cognitive and social aspects of human- robot and digital agent interaction, and of how people perceive and try to protect their privacy online,.

Most of the houses in the district were built in the aftermath of the opening of Union Square in 1839, after which the area became one of the most sought-after residential districts in the city. The houses were primarily made in the Greek Revival and Italianate styles, while later apartment buildings in the district were in the Renaissance Revival style. By 1938, all the single-family dwellings in the district had been converted into apartment buildings. One of the most significant structures in the district is 122 East 17th Street, also known as 49 Irving Place, which was built in 1843-44 as one of three Greek Revival row houses, along with 47 Irving Place and another no longer extant. It was extended along 17th Street c.1853-54, at which time Italianate features were added. Additional changes were made c.1868-70. Despite a historical plaque on the 17th Street facade, there is no historical evidence for the local legend that Washington Irving lived in this house, although his nephew, Edgar Irving, did live next door at 120 East 17th Street, and had a son named Washington Irving after the writer.

Dinodhar Hill is a tourist and pilgrimage spot. Geology Dhinodhar Hill, is a volcanic plug rising above the local sandstone, and composed of relatively fresh, very fine-grained, black to dark grey, largely aphyric (largely without phenocrysts), aphanitic rock, rising to an elevation of 386 meters, it shows several near- vertical, dike-like tabular intrusions with well-developed columnar jointing, and a roughly circular ring breached to the east, enclosing a pronounced crater-like central depression. Dhinodhar is not a vent itself but the eroded remains of a subvolcanic intrusion emplaced at the time of the Deccan Traps. Dhoramnath shrine Dhinodhar shrine On the highest peak of Dhinodhar hill, there is a small, domed, somewhat cracked shrine of limestone and mud plastered with cement, built by Brahma-Kshatriya Shethh Sundarji Shivji in 1821 (Samvat 1877). The shrine faces the east and has no doors. Its measurements are 5 feet square and six high, with an entrance 4 feet high and 2 feet wide. This shrine is sacred to the holy Dhoramnath or Dharmanath, who, after destroying Mandvi, repented of the loss of life, and determined to mortify the flesh by standing on his head on some lonely hill. Travelling to the north he began to climb the highest hill he could see, but it became Nanao, \\"weighed down\\", by his sin. He chose another hill, but for it too the burden of guilt was too great and it became Jhurio, \\"broken down\\". He chose a third hill, and climbing it backwards it bore him, and he called it Dhinodhar, \\"the patience bearer\\". At its highest peak, resting it on a conical stone, he stood on his head for twelve years, a Charan woman feeding him with milk. Such merit and power did this penance bring that the gods took alarm, and, sending a deputation to wait on him, asked that his penance should cease. Dhoramnath said, wherever he first looked, the country would become barren. The gods arranged that he should first look at the sea. This dried up under his gaze and left the desert hence Rann of Kutch came into being. Fearing that the death of so many fish would lose him his merit, Dhoramnath moved his eyes and looking at the hill it split into two. Then Dhoramnath came down, kindled his fire, built a monastery, and established the order of the Kanphatas (literally split-eared). In the shrine is a red -smeared triangular conical stone in which Dhoramnath is said to have rested his head when performing penance. Outside of the shrine is the original ascetic's fire, dhuni, which is lighted three days in Bhadrapad (August‚ÄìSeptember), when the head, Pir, of the monastery comes to worship and receives homage from the people of the neighboring villages. At the foot of the hill, amongst the monastery buildings, is another temple to Dhoramnath on a raised platform facing the east, about seven feet square and with walls about seven feet high. Inside is a three feet high marble image of Dhoramnath, some small lingas, and other brass and stone images, and a lamp always kept burning. In a large shed near is an ascetic's fire, dhuni said to have been burning since the time of Dhoramnath. In August and October, at the Janmashtami and Navratri festivals, rice and wheat flour sweetened with sugar are cooked and given to the people.There may be some relation between Gorakhpur and Dhinodhar where the Yogƒ´s are known as DharamnƒÅthƒ´s. Yet, the pƒ´r at Dhinodhar belongs to the SantnƒÅth sect of the Punjab and NepƒÅl. , reprint of the 1938 edition.In Western India they are generally known as DharamnƒÅthƒ´ (or DhoramnƒÅthƒ´) after a famous disciple of GorakhnƒÅth, by that name. In other parts of India the names KƒÅnpha·π≠a and GorakhnƒÅthƒ´ are commonly used. It is said that the practice of splitting the ears originated with GorakhnƒÅth, and that the designation KƒÅnpha·π≠a (literally, 'Split-eared') was a term of disrespect applied to these Yogƒ´s by MusalmƒÅns. Tourism The hill is pilgrimage centre due to Dhoaramnath shrine. Atop Dinodhar, there are views of the Great Rann and the Chhari Dhandh wetland.

A dance-pop and R&B; track, it was produced by the Neptunes duo Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams, who co-wrote the song alongside Brown and Juan Manuel Cordova. Brown raps on the verses while Kelis, a frequent collaborator with the Neptunes, performs the hook. The song was recorded in Virginia Beach and mixed in New York City. \\"Candy\\" premiered at the Broken Silence listening party, and although it did not receive an official music video, a portion of it was played in the video for the subsequent single \\"Tables Will Turn\\". The song is about cunnilingus, and was described as an \\"ode to oral sex\\" by a music critic. This sexually explicit content marked a continuity with Brown's earlier material, but set \\"Candy\\" apart from the rest of Broken Silence, which tended toward more introspective subject matters. According to critics, the single has elements of 1980s music, dance music, and new wave music and a more pop sound than Brown's previous albums. A minor hit in the US, the song received a positive response upon release and in retrospective reviews. Music critics compared it to songs by other artists, specifically Lil' Kim, and academic scholars discussed its representation of black female sexuality. \\"Candy\\" was often used in early 2000s soundtracks, being featured in the television series Dark Angel and the films Friday After Next and The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  Production and release  Foxy Brown (pictured in 1998) was a co-writer for \\"Candy\\". The Neptunes duo Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams produced two songs‚Äî\\"Candy\\" and \\"Gangsta Boogie\\"‚Äîfor Foxy Brown's third studio album Broken Silence (2001). Billboard's Colin Finan wrote that they had become so prolific in 2001 that they had \\"laced nearly every R&B;/hip-hop hit\\" that summer, including \\"Candy\\". Hugo and Williams co-wrote the single with Juan Manuel Cordova and Brown who is credited under her legal name Inga Marchand. Cordova has writing credits on five other tracks from Broken Silence‚Äî\\"730\\", \\"Bout My Paper\\", \\"Fallin'\\", \\"Hood Scriptures\\", and \\"The Letter\\". \\"Candy\\" features vocals by Kelis, a frequent collaborator with the Neptunes. According to music journalist Peter Shapiro, Kelis was the duo's \\"diva of choice\\" to sing hooks on other artists' songs. Shapiro noted the diversity of her work, mentioning her contributions to music \\"for everyone from Foxy Brown to Noreaga\\". \\"Candy\\" was recorded at the Master Sound Recording Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The vocals were handled by David Hummel and Erik Steinert and mixed by Axel Niehaus at Avatar Studios in New York City. The song debuted at the Broken Silence listening party held in New York City in June 2001. On August 21, 2001, Def Jam released \\"Candy\\" in the US as the album's third and final single. and PolyGram promoted it in the UK in 2002. It was issued as a 12-inch single and a CD single; the 12-inch single included the song's radio edit and instrumental and \\"730\\" as its b-side. Elektra produced a pink vinyl record in a limited edition. To promote \\"Candy\\", Brown performed a portion of it in the music video for her single \\"Tables Will Turn\\". Following its release, \\"Candy\\" was often featured on early 2000s soundtracks, appearing in the films Friday After Next (2002) and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Along with its inclusion on the 2002 soundtrack for the television show Dark Angel, it was also played in the season two episode \\"Some Assembly Required\\". The song was a part of the 2003 compilation album XXX Hip Hop. AllMusic's Tim Sendra wrote that \\"Candy\\", as well as Lil' Kim's \\"Suck My Dick\\" and Khia's \\"My Neck, My Back (Lick It)\\", represented the \\"nasty females\\" on the album. \\"Candy\\" debuted at number 24 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Billboard chart on September 15, 2001. After the single reached number 48 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard chart, The Boombox's Nadine Graham said it had \\"struggled its way up\\" to this position. The song also peaked at number 10 on the Hot Rap Songs Billboard chart in September 2001.  Music and lyrics  In comparison to her previous albums, Brown adopted a \\"more pop- influenced\\" sound for \\"Candy\\", which HipHopDXs Nomatazele further defined as dance-pop. In MTV News, Shaheem Reid said it was a \\"sugary party track\\" that was \\"Spanish guitar-flavored\\", while author Anthony J. Fonseca associated its general style with dance music and refrain to pop music. On the other hand, Colin Finan reviewed the song as part of Billboard's R&B; category rather than pop. Along with these genres, \\"Candy\\" has new wave and 1980s influences. Its instrumental is built on a staccato beat frequently used by the Neptunes. Brown raps the verses \\"aggressively\\" over the song's mid-tempo beat. Finan likened her vocal style to a \\"sexy, husky boom\\", and said Kelis has a more \\"high-pitched, childlike sound\\". \\"Candy\\" is about cunnilingus, as represented in lyrics like \\"Let me know when you're ready to eat\\". Finan wrote that the song was \\"an ode to oral sex\\". Due to this content, reviewers have likened the track to a \\"musical striptease\\" in which Brown boasts of her \\"sexual prowess\\", as well as a \\"graphic description of her bedroom capabilities\\". Although Broken Silence has a larger focus on introspective subject matters, such as \\"The Letter\\" being about a suicide attempt, critics noted it still featured sexually explicit songs, like \\"Candy\\", as had been the case on Brown's past albums. While discussing this change in style, The Guardians Caroline Sullivan clarified: \\"But the sexually provocative Foxy of old isn't completely extinct.\\" Throughout the song, Brown boasts that she tastes \\"just like candy\\". Multiculturalism professor Nichole A. Guillory wrote that Brown acts as stewardess through her instructions to a man to examine her body. In the lyrics, \\"Licking my lips / And adjusting my tits and switching my hips\\", Guillory said the focus is on how Brown seduces a man with her body. Brown invites the anonymous male subject to \\"imagine me nude, stretched out\\" and \\"nipples all out, bent over the sink\\", but also gives him a warning: \\"When I lay on my stomach and throw my legs back / Y'all niggaz won't know how to act.\\" In the third verse, Brown takes on more \\"sexual agency\\", rapping about her self-worth.  Reception  = Critical reception = Kelis (pictured in 2007) received praise for her performance on \\"Candy\\". \\"Candy\\" received a positive response from critics, several of whom cited it as a highlight of Broken Silence, including Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, Steve Jones for the Gannett News Service, and the Associated Press Latrice Davis.; ; . In a review for The Dallas Morning News, Rob Clark praised the song as \\"undeniably catchy\\". Writing for Spin, Joshua Clover described \\"Candy\\" as a \\"strange brew of threatening, hooky, sexy, creepy, and overwhelming\\" vocals, and wrote that the Neptunes represented Brown's \\"discreet charm\\". In Billboard, Colin Finan said the production complimented Brown and Kelis' voices, however, he questioned the song's appeal to some audiences, specifically those of conservative radio stations, due to its sexual content. In a negative review for the Phoenix New Times, Bret McCabe criticized Brown for not having a strong enough voice for R&B; and soul music. According to Nadine Graham, \\"Candy\\" was poorly received by the public; she wrote that \\"the streets hated it\\". Retrospective reviews of \\"Candy\\" have been positive. Fuse's Jeff Benjamin included it on his 2014 Spotify playlist of the best female collaborations. In 2019, HipHopDXs Dana Scott praised \\"Candy\\" as a \\"pop-worthy earworm\\" that helped to brighten the album's mood. The same year, a Tidal contributor named it as one of Brown's best songs, writing that her cadence compliments the synthy production. Although Graham described \\"Candy\\" as a \\"sugary sweet, poppy cut\\", she criticized it as shallow in comparison to Broken Silence's more personal songs. Kelis was also praised in some retrospective articles. In 2008, The News-Press' Mark Marymont said that although Kelis had \\"sometimes thin, even whiny vocals\\", she sounded better on duets like \\"Candy\\". Patrick D. McDermott, writing in a 2017 article for The Fader, cited the single as one of Kelis' best collaborations; he described the hook as \\"stone-cold classic Kelis\\" and \\"lightyears ahead of its time\\". Reviewers have compared \\"Candy\\" to music by other artists, specifically Lil' Kim.; ; Gender studies scholars Jennifer Esposito and Bettina Love likened the song's candy metaphor to Lil' Kim's \\"Kitty Box\\" from her 2005 album The Naked Truth. Rob Clark wrote that \\"Candy\\" was not as provocative as Lil' Kim's singles. While reviewing Macy Gray's 2001 album The Id, The Washington Posts Arion Berger said the track Harry had a \\"sexual boast as bold\\" as \\"Candy\\", a song that he described as \\"supremely nasty\\". Author Roni Sarig praised the Neptune's production on \\"Candy\\", Beyonc√©'s \\"Work It Out\\", and Common's \\"I Got a Right Ta\\" as a \\"combination of classical soul, blues, and pop bundled with twenty-first century digital mayhem\\". = Scholarly analysis = \\"Candy\\" has been the subject of scholarly analysis. Scholar Doyinsola Faluyi cited Brown's appearance on the single's cover as an example of how some black female rappers used their sexuality to promote their image. According to Faluyi, this was a contrast to artists like Da Brat who adopted more masculine styles to conform to \\"the dominant fashion in male hip-hop culture\\". The lyrics were discussed by Jennifer Esposito and Bettina Love who believed Brown's boasts about being the dominant sexual partner disproved psychologist Michelle Fine's theories on \\"sexuality as victimization\\". Esposito and Love remarked that Brown's demands for oral sex in the song challenge negative attitudes on sexually active women to instead \\"make it clear that women can desire sex and can ask for pleasure\\". Some scholars were critical of the single. Nichole A. Guillory criticized \\"Candy\\" as a sexual fantasy that objectifies a black woman's body to appeal to a male gaze, writing that its lyrics portray black women as \\"territories to be penetrated, occupied and ravaged by men\\". Guillory noted that Brown demonstrates some agency when she brags about being priceless. Although she felt this moment was not strong enough to undo the overall objectification present in the lyrics, she acknowledged it as \\"an important reminder of the ongoing struggle between black women and men for control of black women's bodies\\". In another critical analysis of the song, Esposito and Love questioned if Brown was promoting further the stereotype that \\"bad girls are used sexually by men, while good girls are the ones men want to marry\\".

Chandrasekar about a Pakistani Prime Minister visiting India for a Test Cricket match and the ensuing diplomatic drama and chaos. The plot The Pakistani Premier's sudden decision to invite himself to a cricket series to be played in India creates uncertainty, panic and bureaucratic gamesmanship in New Delhi. Seemingly above such mundane concerns, India's elderly Prime Minister, devoted to movies, scotch, and late mornings, adds to the confusion with random utterances and occasional temper tantrums. His official factotum, a bureaucrat named Swami, plays the confusion for all it is worth, attempting to advance his career and settle old scores. Old rivalries between the Foreign Service and the domestic bureaucrats flare up as the day of the Pakistani Premier's visit approaches. Matters get stalled as rival departments choose to hide behind arcane laws. Conscious of his place in history and of the damage a botched visit would cause, the Prime Minister stages his own protests. Swami is forced to chart a treacherous course between his political and bureaucratic masters... A parable rooted in the absurdities of modern India, this novel takes a light-hearted dig at the pretensions of people who matter. About the author R. Chandrasekar was born in Madras and studied at Mayo College, Vivekananda College Madras, the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Chicago. He has researched and priced commodities and derivatives, traded bonds, managed portfolios, taught, and run a financial research centre. Chandrasekar lives with his family in the city formerly known as Madras. This is his first novel.

Life Browsholme Hall. Born at Browsholme Hall, Yorkshire (now in Lancashire), England on 27 September 1779, he was the eldest of the eight sons of John Parker of Browsholme, by his wife Beatrix, daughter of Thomas Lister of Gisburne Park, then in Yorkshire (but now in Lancashire). He was educated at the Clitheroe Royal Grammar School under Thomas Wilson. On the death of his father on 25 May 1797, Parker succeeded to the Browsholme estate. In 1804 and 1805 he made alterations to the sixteenth century Browsholme Hall, rebuilding the west wing, and afterwards he made additions under the superintendence of Sir Jeffrey Wyatville. Parker had a taste for landscape gardening, and between 1797 and 1810 spent large sums in laying out his grounds. In the house he displayed a collection of antiquities and pictures, partly formed by himself. He had a large series of drawings and prints bought during a tour on the continent in 1800 and 1801, in Moscow, Venice, and Paris; a large collection of drawings of castles and manor-houses by John Chessell Buckler, and portfolios of his own drawings. He also owned pictures of the Flemish school and works of James Northcote and Thomas Gainsborough. Parker was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1801, and afterwards Fellow of the Royal Society. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1804. He had the sinecure post of \\"Trumpeter to the Queen\\", and also claimed the office, as hereditary in his family for many generations, of \\"Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland\\". A liberal patron of artists, Parker's expenditure brought him into difficulties in the latter part of his life. In 1820 he sold Browsholme estate, with the mansion, to his cousin, Thomas Parker of Alkincoats Hall, Colne, Lancashire, who, dying without issue in 1832, left it to his nephew, Thomas Goulbourne Parker (1818‚Äì1879). Parker retired from society, and lived at the Star Inn in Deansgate, Manchester, where he died, unmarried, on 2 March 1858. He was buried on 9 March in his family chapel in Waddington Church, Yorkshire. Works In 1815 Parker published a Description of Browsholme Hall ‚Ä¶ and of the Parish of Waddington. The volume included a collection of letters of the reigns of Charles I, Charles II, and James II, printed from the originals at Browsholme. The frontispiece gives a view of the exterior of the hall in 1750. The views of Browsholme in Thomas Dunham Whitaker's Parish of Whalley were prepared at Parker's expense, one of them, signed \\"Wm. Turner A.\\", being by J. M. W. Turner. Parker was an associate of Whitaker, who used his antiquarian and genealogical manuscripts for his Whalley.

It was first identified by Goldwurm et al. in 1996. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database entry for ZNF184 identifies conserved domains KRAB_A (Kr√ºppel associated box) near the N-terminus and Zn-finger (Zinc finger) at the C-terminus of the translated protein. The former is associated with transcription repression and the latter with DNA binding (see Zinc finger). Domains and Structure The figure below is a reformatted and annotated conceptual translation display of ZNF184's Consensus CDS. CCDS displays exons in alternating black and blue font, with red indicating a residue coded across a splice boundary. ZNF184 has 19 zinc finger motifs at the end of its final and longest exon. The figure shows regularity among the fingers in this protein, including the 2 columns of green-highlighted Cysteine residues and the 2 columns of blue-highlighted His residues which are the reason this type of zinc finger is called C2H2. Light grey highlighted columns (one with all F; one with mostly L, and F substitutions) are highly conserved hydrophobic residues within the zinc finger motif. The other light grey highlighted column (mostly K, with a similar R substitution) is an example of fairly strong conservation in the coil sections connecting adjacent fingers. Near the N-terminus is a KRAB_A domain followed by a KRAB_B domain. KRAB_A has a shorter Œ±-Helix followed by a longer Œ±-Helix. The KRAB_A motif in a zinc finger protein is known to bind with a KAP-1 protein (aka TRIM28) to accomplish a transcription repressor function, however a gene so regulated by ZNF184 has yet to be identified. The length-11 finger helices are indicated, as well as the overlapping 7-residue section in each finger which binds targeted DNA (if the finger is functioning).

History The first documentary records for Kirtling Tower date from 1219, and the 13th century Kirtling Castle was described as having a moat, a ditch and a palisade.Kirtling: Manors and estate, A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 10: Cheveley, Flendish, Staine and Staploe Hundreds (north-eastern Cambridgeshire) (2002), pp. 63-69. Date accessed: 21 April 2011. In 1424 there was a substantial rebuilding of the castle by Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Warwick, with a hundred oak trees used to create a complex with a parlour, a solar and chambers. Edward North, a successful lawyer, rebuilt the castle in the 1540s and between 1556 and 1558 using the architect Francis Adams, renaming it Kirtling Hall. The earthworks around the castle were considerably altered to provide for a raised platform for the new house, which included contemporary Tudor features such as a gatehouse, gallery, lodgings, a banqueting house and a garden, complete with grand water features and ponds. Queen Elizabeth I stayed at the castle as the guest of Roger North, 2nd Baron North for three days in September 1578 during her state procession across Cambridgeshire.William Stevenson, 'Extracts from the Household Book of Lord North', Archaeologia, vol. 19 (London, 1821), pp. 287-290 The visit cost Lord North ¬£642.Lawrence Stone, Crisis of the Aristocracy (Oxford, 1965), p. 452. The castle continued to develop, and by the 1660s was the largest country house in Cambridgeshire, centered on a symmetrical two-storeyed south-facing range, with east and west wings providing additional accommodation and facilities. The castle went into decline after 1691 and by 1735 the Victoria County History of the castle describes the property as being \\"in disorder\\". Much of the castle was pulled down in 1748 in order to make the remainder habitable for Lord Elibank, but the property went into decline again after his death in 1762. By the 1770s it was unhabitable and most of the castle was pulled down in 1801. In the 1830s the gatehouse was turned into a residential property and was renamed Kirtling Tower; an extension was built in 1872 and the house remained in use under a sequence of tenants. Today The main feature of the castle today is the three-storeyed Tudor gatehouse, which closely resembles the gatehouse at Leez Priory, built by North's friend and fellow lawyer Richard Rich. Built of brick, it has octagonal turrets and an oriel window of Italian design. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

The fourth-year electrical apprentice subsequently moved to Tasmanian Football League side Hobart for the 2010 season. A full- forward, Howe made an immediate impact for the Tigers, becoming well known for his bleached blonde hair and high-flying marks. A player with impressive kicking skills and a big leap, Howe was recruited by Melbourne with the 33rd selection in the 2010 AFL Draft. His spectacular marking has drawn comparison with fellow Tasmanian and former Melbourne high-flyer, Russell Robertson. Howe made his debut against Essendon in Round 11 of the 2011 AFL season. Gathering 19 disposals in an impressive debut, Howe kicked his first AFL goal with a \\"miraculous snap\\" in the third quarter, helping Melbourne to a 33-point victory. Howe is known for his high-flying and crowd pleasing marks that light up the stadium. In 2012 he won the Mark of the Year award, an award for which he has had an league record 35 career nominations. In October 2015, Howe was traded to the Collingwood Football Club. Howe is the cousin of Australian and Tasmanian cricketer Matthew Wade. He attended Rose Bay High School in Hobart.

It was first recorded in 1984 by Drs. Elizabeth Graham and David M. Pendergast, and was named by them after their local guide. The existence of the site, which is located approximately south of San Pedro, had been known to the town's inhabitants for many years, as had most of the other sites that dot the island. The site was excavated by Drs. Graham and Pendergast between 1984 and 1994. Topography The ruins are about in size, and are easily visible from the air flying into San Pedro town. The low-lying area around the site is predominated by red (Rhizophora mangle) and black (Avicennia nitida) mangroves. The site itself is covered by white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), white poisonwood (Cameraria belizensis), silver palmettos (Thrinax sp.), cabbage palms (Roystonea oleracea) and a variety of shrubbery. It is roughly above sea level, slightly higher than the surrounding swamps due to accumulated anthrosol, soil composed primarily of artefacts (e.g., pottery, tools), conch and other shells, building remains and other debris resulting from millennia of human habitation. The presence of artefacts beneath the mangal swamps indicates that the site was once larger than what is now exposed. Surrounded by thick jungle, access to the site is difficult, especially during and immediately after the rainy season. The trails leading there have become increasingly overgrown and visitors are rare. Ruins There are at least 49 distinct structures and walls within the mapped area of the site. The structures at the northern end appear to be arranged around plazas, while elsewhere the building plan appears less formal. All of the structures are relatively low platforms, ranging in height from to . There are none of the pyramids typical of other Mayan sites in this region. Building foundations are composed mainly of blocks of Pleistocene limestone that was most likely quarried from local sources. Other building materials include the queen conch Strombus gigas as well as other shells. Crude plaster floors were found in some structures, and evidence suggests that many of the habitations were of pole-and-thatch-roof design. The site is littered with enormous amounts of broken pottery, as well as conch shells, chert tools and human bones. There is considerable evidence of excessive looting. History The excavations conducted by Graham and Pendergast in 1989 indicate that initial occupation of the site occurred about 2,100 years ago, during the late Preclassic period. From then, the site appears to have been continuously inhabited until roughly 1500 CE, at which time it was abruptly abandoned. The peak period of occupation at the site was during the Postclassic period, from about 1200 to 1400 CE. The Maya inhabitants are believed to have been predominantly fisherfolk and later, during the late Classic period (from about 800‚Äì500 CE), involved in intensive salt production. Evidence suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of Marco Gonzalez traded extensively with other Maya sites. The abundant pottery that litters the site is made from mixtures of clay and quartz; since there is no available source of these materials on Ambergris Caye, they (or perhaps even the pots themselves) must have been brought to the site from overseas. Other artefacts at the site, such as chert and flint tools and other granite artefacts, minor jade and obsidian, were also obviously imported from elsewhere since the materials have no natural source anywhere on Ambergris Caye. The site's setting on the tip of the island may have given it a strategic position on maritime trade routes that existed at the time. =Theories on abandonment= In 1993, a geological history of southern Ambergris Caye and the Marco Gonzalez area was published by R.K. Dunn and S.J. Mazzullo, which provides a theory as to why the site was abruptly abandoned around 500 years ago. A representative cross-section of the site revealed evidence that, between roughly 2000 and 1000 years ago, the coastal geography changed from open, shallow sea to mangal swampland. Rapid rising in sea levels caused by the melting of the last Pleistocene glaciers caused the geography of the coastal area around Marco Gonzalez to change. As sea levels rose, the coastline shifted to shelter the surrounding area from currents, allowing mangrove swamps to completely surround the site. Eventually, the encroachment of the surrounding jungle and swamplands made the site inhospitable, and the Maya abandoned it. The discovery of artefacts below present sea level, and beneath the mangrove peats, indicated that the habitable area of the site was much larger in the past than now; and subsequently that the inhabitants moved to progressively higher ground as sea level rose and the swamps encroached upon them.

Barandabhar, a 29 km long forest patch, is bisected by the Mahendra Highway, resulting in a 56.9 km2 area in the buffer zone of RCNP and 31 km2 is under the district forest office. The buffer zone area of BCF holds 48.016 km2 forest, 5.018 km2 grassland, 3.276 km2 shrub lands and 0.5 km2 of water bodies collectively called Bishazari lake. The surrounding six village development committees are Bachhauli, Gitanagar, Patihani, Jutpani, Pithuwa, Padampur (New) and two municipalities, Ratnanagar (Ward Number 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10), Bharatpur (Ward Number 8, 9, 11 and 12). The major rivers around the forest are Rapti, Budhi Rapti, and Khageri. The Beeshazari lake, which is located in the middle of jungle having altitude 256 m from sea level, is considered as the second largest natural wetland of Nepal and recently included in Ramsar site by NG. Inhabitants The surrounding village development committees and municipalities consist a total of 1,25,652 person and the family size 5.95 including Tharus and other ethnic groups (KMTNC 2002 and Resource Himalaya 2000) Climate The forest has range of climate seasons winter, spring and monsoon with subtropical climate. Mean annual minimum and maximum temperature, mean annual precipitation and mean annual relative humidity recorded during the year 1999-2001 at Rampur, approximately 11 km from study area has shown in figure 1. a, b and c respectively. The monsoon begins at the end of May and continues until September and the mean annual rainfall was 192 mm and highest in July (604.8 mm), lowest in January (0.9 mm) and no rainfall in December. Flora The flora of Barandabhar forest is dominated mainly by sal forest and partly by riverine, tall grassland and short grassland. The percentage of vegetation of Chitwan Valley consists of (70%) sal forest (a moist deciduous type), grassland (20%), Riverine forest (7%) and sal with chir pine (3%). (Majupuria 1998). The latter type of vegetation is not present in Barandabhar forest. =Sal forest= Sal forest is dominated by sal (Shorea robusta) and the associated species with sal are Semecarpus anacardium, Terminalia bellirica, Terminalia tomentosa. A large number of other trees, shrubs, creepers, ferns, flowers and grasses grow among or under the sal. =Riverine forest= Riverine forests grow along watercourses and their composition varies greatly from place to place. Common species of riverine forest are simal (Bombax ceiba), sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo), and Bhellar (Trewia nudiflora) and in the lower canopy Clerodendrum viscosum, Zizyphus mauritiana are present. =Tall grassland= The alluvial flood plains support a luxuriant growth of grasses interspersed with patches of riverine forest. These tall and dense stands of grasses are popularly called 'elephant grass'. Tall grassland is dominated by kans (Saccharum spontaneum), and distributed along the Rapti and Budhi Rapti riverside. =Short grassland= Barandabhar forest is very important for short grassland, which is mainly dominated by Siru (Imperata sps.). It is the most important grass for human beings called as Siru Khar in Nepali, which is used by local people for thatching. Fauna Sal forest dominated Barandabhar forest contains 22 species of mammals including tiger, rhinoceros, Asian elephant, sloth bear, wild boar, sambar deer, spotted deer, hog deer, barking deer and 280 species of birds including giant hornbill, hill myna, and storks. It is a critical habitat for many species of migratory birds (e.g., Siberian crane), aquatic birds, and mugger crocodile. More than 45 species of herpeto fauna represented by frog, toad, lizards, python and crocodile are found in Barandabhar Corridor Forest (Resource Himalaya 2000 and KMTNC 2002). =Ungulates= Among the six orders of ungulates, 3 orders are distributed in Nepal, which include Artiodactyla (deers and bovines), perissodactyla (horses and rhinoceros) and proboscidea (elephant) (Majupuria, 1998). Among the ungulate species found in Barandabhar Corridor Forest, rhinoceros and wild elephant are listed on APPENDIX I (threatened with extinction) of CITES, Endangered on the IUCN Red List of 1996 and protected by HMG/Nepal under schedule 1 (section 10) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (HMGN 1973), but other 5 species are in common category. *Spotted deer (Axis axis): Chital is indigenous to Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Nepal (Prater 1998). The main distribution area in Nepal is throughout Tarai, with major concentrations in parks and reserves (Mishra 1982). In Chitwan, males averaged 71 kg and female averaged 75 cm at shoulder height and weighed 50 kg (Mishra 1982) and the rutting period reaches a peak in May when most of the stags have hard antlers (Mishra and Wemmer 1987). Chital prefer newly burned phatas as feeding habitats (Moe 1993) and rest in forest habitats during the middle of the day (Naess and Anderson 1993). Chital are nocturnal, but might feed until late in the morning (Prater 1998). Their social organization is variable with small groups of 2 - 20 individuals common, but herds of more than fifty animals can be found (Bhattarai 2003). The herd size varies seasonally, increasing during the monsoon season (75 - 81 individuals) (Schaller 1967 and Bhattarai 2003). *Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor): The main distribution of sambar deer in Nepal is throughout reserves and parks of Tarai (Mishra 1982). The wooded districts of India, Burma, and Ceylon extending through the Malay countries and eastwards to the Philippines (Prater 1998). Hence sambar deer is widely distributed in the forests of southern Asia, but little studies have been done on its biology. Several short accounts are available on the biology of the species (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh, 1983 and Krishan, 1972). These short accounts together give a good background of the species. The coat is coarse and shaggy. The general colour is brown with a yellowish or grayish tinge. Females are lighter in tone; old stags tend to become very dark, almost black. Sambar is found in a wide variety of habitats and is an animal of high adaptability. Their food consists of grass, leaves, and various kinds of wild fruit. They feed mainly at night and retire into heavy cover at daybreak and do not usually come out till dusk (Prater 1998). The group size ranges from 2 to 4 (Bhattarai 2003) and rarely found associating in large numbers (Prater 1998). In disturbed forest, they are found mostly solitary and graze at early morning and late evening (Bhattarai 2003). *Hog deer (Axis porcinus): Hog deer has a much wider distribution than chital and covers the area throughout the alluvial grassland of northern India, extending eastward to southern Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indo-China, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1998). In Nepal, hog deer are mainly concentrated in Chitwan, Karnali-Bardia and Sukla Phantas (Mishra 1982). Antlers consist of long bony pedicels with a short brow tine and a straight beam with a fork at the top (Prater 1998 and Mishra 1982). Fawning occurred from January to April in Chitwan (Dhungel and O'Gara 1991). Mishra and Wemmer (1987) found that the fawning season starts in February and increases until May. Tall grasses along the riverbanks, open phantas are favoured habitats. They are generally solitary but sometimes-small groups may graze together. During the hot hours of the day hog deer shelter in tall grass and they feed early in the morning and in the evening (Dhungel and O'Gara 1991). *Barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak): Muntjak is found in Nepal, northern India and Bhutan, from sea level to 3000 meters in the Himalayas (Mishra 1982). This is the smallest deer of Barandabhar Corridor Forest. The antlers are small, consisting of a short brow-tine and an unbranched beam set on bony hair covered pedicels (Prater 1998). Fawning season has a main peak in November and two smaller in May and August ‚Äî September (Mishra and Wemmer 1987). Barking deer are solitary or exist in small family groups and are most common in dense forest habitats and graze in open forest edges and is fairly diurnal (Prater 1998). *Wild boar (Sus scrofa): Wild boar is distributed throughout India, the southern part of Nepal, Burma and Sri Lanka (Prater 1998). Older boars are grayer than the more brownish young ones. Adults have a more of black bristles from the nape and down the back. Wild boar breed in all seasons, and after breeding they live together with other individuals at the same size or alone (Prater 1998). Wooded grassland, swampy areas, forest and dense bush are preferred habitats, and they build shelters of grass, reeds or brush. The wild boars are omnivorous, eating crops, roots, tubers, insects, snakes etc. (Prater 1998). *Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis): The Indian one-horned rhinoceros ranged throughout northern India, Myitkina (Burma), and Nepal (southern central Tarai to far western Tarai) (Prater 1998). The Indian rhinoceros has also been reported in Sylhet (Bangladesh) and Cacher (Rook Maaker 1980). It is one of the largest of all existing rhinoceros. The skin of this massive creature is divided into great shields by heavy folds before and behind the shoulders and in front of the thighs. Though it prefers swamp, grass as well as the rhinoceros is also found in wood jungle up ravines and low hills (Prater 1998). They are recorded in river and lakes as well as grassland and forested area (Bhattarai 2003). All rhinoceros defecate on old piles and fresh dung is a stimulus to defecate. Usually, calves defecate after their mothers (Laurie 1979). The population of rhinoceros in Chitwan is considered as the second largest population in the world. There are altogether 612 rhinoceros in Nepal, with less than 100 rhinoceros in Nepal in the 1960s, the figure has risen to 612 in 2000, with a growth rate of 3.88% per year (DNPWC 2000). *Asian elephant (Elephas maximus): Elephants are the largest living mammals found on land. The Asiatic or Indian elephant is widely distributed in the Himalayan Tarai in northern India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, South China, Malaya, and Sumatra (Prater 1998). Generally only the males have large tusks. Elephants have very poor sight; the senses of smell and hearing are highly developed. Elephants chiefly frequent areas covered with tall forests of Nepal and India. Elephant sleep during the hot hours of the day, feed early in the morning and evening, in open forest or raid crops, retire to sleep after midnight (Prater 1998). The exact number of elephants in Nepal is not correctly assessed so far. There are, however, reports of annual fluctuation in their numbers due to their preference of favorable area in Nepal as well as Haldwani forest of India (Singh 1966). Thagunna (1999) studied about trans- boundary elephant corridor with great emphasis on protecting the wild elephant dispersal patterns of the far western Tarai region through corridor linking. According to their current population trends, the elephants are suffering from the adverse effects of mismanaged forests and loss of habitat. They occur in four main populations that exist along the eastern, central, western and far- western Tarai Belt, which has put their population of around 100 animals in the country, in grave danger.

Ensemble librarians acquire printed music and prepare it for performance.  History  Ensemble or performance librarianship is a relatively new and evolving field with an oral history, so in many instances, there is no written history upon which to rely. Aside from a few surveys and recorded interviews, there are very few documents describing the history of the profession at this point in time. Historically, music librarians were only required to handle acquisitions and distribution‚Äîthey did not have the requirements many librarians have today to mark individual parts for performance, correct errors, work in close consultation with the music director and/or artistic staff, and conduct scholarly research. Traditionally, many orchestra librarians were string players, since they already possessed a working knowledge of bowings (markings made in string parts). \\"Until 1970s, in all but the largest orchestras the librarian had a playing position in the orchestra and engaged in part time library work to supplement his or her income. In other cases the librarian had retired from playing and still wished to remain a part of the orchestra.\\" A survey at the 1998 annual conference of the Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA) revealed that \\"in some smaller orchestras ..., the library position had remained part-time for the most part until the mid 1980s to early 1990s.\\" In some organizations, librarian duties were alternatively fulfilled by an administrative staff member (i.e. personnel manager or orchestra manager) and this is still the case with many smaller organizations today. Gradually, particularly with the larger orchestras and bands, the role of music librarian has become a job obtained on an audition basis and which requires the demonstration of extensive knowledge of not only music notation, history, and performance practice, but also specialized technique and research ability. Today, larger and more established organizations can have multiple librarians and a hierarchy has developed, where a principal librarian is often identified and compensated accordingly (much like principal string or wind/brass/percussion players in an orchestral setting). This principal librarian may then work with one or more assistant librarians and can delegate tasks.  Education  = Formal education = A professional ensemble librarian requires a diverse and extensive musical, research, and often administrative-oriented background. Currently, there is no formal degree program specifically for ensemble or performance librarianship offered at any academic institution. Consequently, primary forms of training include degree programs or their equivalent in music performance (instrumental), music theory, musicology, or related fields, in conjunction with mentoring, internships, and on-the-job training. In the United States, work as an apprentice with a career librarian is a common and invaluable educational tool. Some ensemble librarians hold degrees in library science (LIS, MLIS). \\"Most music schools and many library / information science schools have programs that offer a variety of related course work which could be applied to orchestra librarianship.\\" While such experience can be very helpful, this is not typically a specific requirement to work as an ensemble librarian. Ideally, \\"training for orchestra librarianship should include a broad and intensive education in all aspects of music and the liberal arts. This career requires a combination of formal education and extensive practical experience in a symphonic organization.\\" = Required skills and abilities =  Qualifications  Quoted with permission from Russ Girsberger's \\"A Manual for the Performance Library\\":  Library auditions  In the U.S., some professional ensemble librarians must now endure a process similar to instrumental orchestral auditions in order to obtain their jobs. \\"Marcia Farabee (Principal Librarian, National Symphony) explains that today some orchestras have adopted a similar audition process for librarians. These 'librarian auditions' involve interviews as well as written tests which ask questions to which a qualified candidate should know the answers.\\" Experience, formal education, and references provided on the auditionee's r√©sum√© play an important role, but the candidate may be required to pass this live audition and interview component, as well. As noted, larger orchestras and the more prestigious summer fellowships may require a candidate to pass a written exam demonstrating knowledge of composers, important historical facts, publishers, and repertoire. Librarians wishing to pursue this career study long hours in order to prepare for these auditions and therefore, professional ensemble librarianship is becoming a competitive field in North America. In Europe, many ensemble librarians currently obtain their positions via a more standard job interview process.  Functions of the performance librarian  = Music acquisition and cataloging = The ensemble librarian is often the primary individual responsible for research, acquisition (via purchase, rental, commission, or lending), receipt of materials, and cataloging of performing materials (scores and parts) for a musical organization. The librarian consults and collaborates with the music director, other artistic or administrative staff members, and/or soloists to identify the correct edition or version of the work to be acquired and its source, then works to determine its cost, delivery time, method of delivery, and any other associated concerns. The librarian may also be responsible for locating and obtaining perusal materials (scores and/or recordings for study). An important component of the acquisition process, particularly in the case of renting works under copyright, can be obtaining permission and licensing for any recording, broadcast (radio or World Wide Web), or other types of mechanical use that may be planned. Following the purchase or commission of performance materials, the librarian may be obligated to create and/or maintain a catalog of the musical organization's physical holdings of performance and reference material. This can be as simple as an itemized listing of materials owned or as complex as designing and implementing a custom-made electronic catalog for the ensemble. Many organizations utilize pre-existing database programs such as OPAS. Upon receipt of purchased or donated materials, the librarian inventories the scores and parts, stamps or otherwise marks them with the organization's name and identifying information, and prepares them for storage. Cataloging can also extend to maintaining a record of conductor markings and dates of use, condition of materials, and performance and lending history. = Part preparation and distribution = The most essential task of the ensemble librarian is to provide adequately prepared parts to the players of the ensemble. Collaboration with conductors and soloists is often necessary in order to determine the specific requirements concerning the part preparation process. The goal is to ensure smooth flow of rehearsals and performances. Music arriving from a publisher or rental agent is rarely ready for use as such; most parts will need adjustments to make them more suitable for the performer. This most frequently includes marking string bowings, fixing bad page turns, adding and/or coordinating rehearsal figures, clarifying illegible notation and correcting errata. Editing of tempos, dynamics, articulations, inserts, and cuts or transposition into a singer's preferred vocal range or instrumentalist's preferred key may also be required. Additional proofreading may also be necessary, due to mistakes or inconsistencies in published editions. Once the parts have been prepared appropriately, the orchestra librarian will assemble concert folders or arrange part pick-up for the musicians. The concert folder contains all the music for the complete concert for an individual musician (e.g. Oboe I) or a single desk of musicians (such as Violin I / Desk 1). Assembling the concert folders needs to be finished well in advance of each series of performances to make sure the musicians have time to practice. In some orchestras, the librarian is responsible for delivering concert folders to the music stands on stage for all rehearsals and performances. Once the performances are over, the librarian disassembles the concert folders, tracks down any missing parts and stores any performance materials owned by the orchestra. Hired or rented sets are returned, and archival copies of bowings are usually made for future reference. = Preservation = The ensemble librarian is responsible for the care and preservation of the ensemble's music collection. In addition to the purchase cost of printed sheet music, the value of the library collection increases with information added during rehearsals and preparation work done to the parts. This value is inherent and often irreplaceable. Damage to printed music may occur due to environmental sources (sunlight, temperature, humidity, pests, dust), physical handling, and improper storage. Appropriate humidity and temperature, protection from light sources (especially ultraviolet light) and from acid materials are key factors in ensuring the long life of printed music. = Auditions = One common recruitment process of musicians for professional orchestras and bands is an audition and the ensemble's librarian is often responsible for preparing the materials required for such auditions. These usually include a round consisting of excerpts from standard orchestral repertoire that the auditionee is required to perform for the audition committee. The orchestra librarian is usually in charge of preparing the audition materials for the auditionees and audition committee. Care must be taken that starts, stops, key and time signatures, tempo markings and transpositions are properly indicated. The librarian is often responsible for acquiring publishers' permissions for reproducing the audition excerpts of works still under [copyright]. = Methods and tools = In the area of research, cataloging, storage and preservation of music, music libraries share many methods in common with ensemble libraries. Many ensemble librarians use a comprehensive computerized database such as OPAS that integrates information about the composer, instrumentation, and performance history of standard orchestral works. Use of the internet has provided librarians easier access to information, especially research and reference materials. The online forum of the Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA) has greatly increased communication between professional librarians and provided excellent opportunities for networking and exchange of information. The tools traditionally used for the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software. The part preparation process is traditionally done by hand for every single part to be used on stage. Bowings need to be marked into the string parts using pencil, since they are likely to change on stage during rehearsals, and the players need to be able to incorporate the alterations easily. The same applies to conductors' personal tempo indications and dynamic markings. Temporary musical edits (such as cuts and inserts) are done in a way which allows their easy removal afterward. In addition to common library tools, ensemble librarians often utilize music engraving software for incorporating last-minute musical changes such as transpositions, \\"concert\\" endings, inserts or other musical edits to the performance material at hand. On occasion, digital image processing software (such as Adobe Photoshop) is used for correcting errata and enhancing print quality of problematic performance materials of public domain musical works. Use of digital technology is becoming common in the task of preparing audition excerpts for the musician recruitment process., = Administrative duties = In addition to the artistic roles ensemble librarians play within their organizations, many also manage duties that are administrative in nature. The administrative duties of an ensemble librarian differ depending on the type of musical organization for which the librarian works. The ensemble librarian's administrative tasks can range from control of the receipt and delivery of the performance materials to managing invoices and payments and creating an annual budget for the library; support for the program planning on issues related to instrumentation (music), off-stage music, different versions or editions, correct instrumentation. . .; providing assistance and support to the conductors, musicians, singers, choir, soloists and all professionals involved in concert production; managing the lending of musical materials to other institutions; providing additional notes or information for the printed concert program; coordinating the obtaining of rights for performance, recording or broadcast.  Areas of practice  = Symphony and chamber orchestras = Many ensemble librarians work in the field of symphony and chamber orchestras, forming the most typical professional profile of a performance librarian. Performance librarianship in professional symphony and chamber orchestras is characterized by frequently changing programs and a large total number of works performed, reflecting in the large number of performance materials and sets of parts to be prepared. Many full- time, professional, North American symphony orchestras employ two or even three music librarians (typically, a principal librarian and one or more assistant librarians). In Europe, full-sized symphony orchestras operate with fewer resources. For example, The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra all are single-librarian orchestras. The symphony orchestra librarian is in frequent contact with conductors and soloists to coordinate the editions and versions of works to be used, possible alterations or edits required, and their appropriate implementation. These can include cuts, inserts, supplemental rehearsal markings, transpositions and doublings. The librarian may also be involved in providing information to the orchestra administration for program planning purposes, such as information on the duration and instrumentation of the works in question, and any rental or purchase costs. This is essential information for the symphony orchestra repertoire planning process and the librarian can play an integral role. = Opera = The complexity of opera librarianship is due to the diversity and quantity of performance materials required (such as vocal scores, chorus scores, full scores, orchestral parts, off-stage parts), plus the sheer duration of operatic works makes the job a challenge. Opera productions are often subject to revision; occasionally sections of the music are skipped (\\"cuts\\" are made) or otherwise altered, and some excerpts may be transposed to a different key to accommodate the vocal range of the soloists. Several operas have different musical versions: different historical versions, versions sung in different languages or recent revisions made in editions of the work. Translations and transliterations may have to be inserted into the vocal scores, and most often this is organized by the librarian. In addition, as opera is a scenic art form, some musical considerations can develop due to the stage direction. Consequently, the librarian is in charge of implementing the necessary edits into the performance material provided by the opera library. = Ballet = Music in ballet is often subject to extensive revision, re-ordering and adaptation by the choreographer. This creates additional and varied duties for the ballet librarian, as opposed to the symphony or opera librarian. The choreography often requires cuts and sequence changes to the music, and therefore the librarian must be able to make the cuts logical and smooth in a musical sense. Knowledge of standard ballet repertoire and major ballet choreographers is necessary, since there are often several adaptations and arrangements of these works available. = Bands = The concert band or wind ensemble librarian's duties greatly resemble those of an orchestral performance librarian, but certain variations exist. For example, bands do not include the string sections for which orchestral librarians mark bowings into individual parts. A few examples of bands that might employ librarians are military bands, wind ensembles, brass bands, marching bands, jazz bands, ensembles at educational institutions, and popular music groups. The band librarian's work is greatly dependent on the performance venues and number of performances of the band‚Äîsome military bands may perform in several ceremonies each day, and often a vast body of music must be ready to go on short notice. Marching, military, or brass bands may also perform in parades. In addition, many bands perform concerts on tour. = Educational institutions = Many top-level music schools and conservatories employ either professional and/or student ensemble librarians. Professionals often hold staff positions with the institution and job titles can range from \\"Music Librarian\\" to \\"Band Department Administrative Assistant\\" or \\"Orchestra Manager.\\" In addition to performance librarian duties on par with professional organizations, educational institution positions often entail extensive administrative duties for the music department and personnel manager tasks, as well. Librarians in the university setting can oversee not only orchestras, bands, and choirs, but also wind or brass repertoire, conducting, and master classes; placement auditions; chamber music ensembles and more. The work of an academic librarian can vary from that of a professional ensemble's librarian in many ways. For example, university ensembles tend to employ part rotation for educational purposes, whereas professional groups more often have one designated player per part or string seating position. Consequently, librarians at educational institutions must develop different types of part distribution systems than may be used at the professional level. In addition, the academic librarian may be obligated to coordinate greater circulation of materials to faculty, rotating and guest conductors, student recitals, and community organizations. This can present additional work to mark and re-mark parts each time they are to be used by the primary ensemble. Educational institutions may also provide significantly more practice parts and allow the check-out of parts much earlier by students in order to provide ample practice time, whereas professional musicians may not require this provision for as many of the scheduled works. = Music festivals = An alternative career or summer opportunity for the ensemble librarian is to work for a music festival, either professional or educational. Such positions are often part-time or seasonal and can afford the ensemble librarian with experience preparing different types of repertoire and working with different types of musicians. Various organizations compile and maintain listings of current classical music festivals, including professional music organizations such as the League of American Orchestras publication Symphony, university music departments such as the Juilliard School, and student organizations such as Sigma Alpha Iota. MOLA maintains a listing of summer festival job openings on their website.  Professional organizations  For various reasons (such as the limited number of professionals in a particular geographical area, the dynamic scenario of working for a performing arts organization, and the lack of a formal academic degree program in the field), cooperation among professional ensemble librarians is not only helpful, but essential. International and national organizations facilitate the collaboration among ensemble library professionals and offer further opportunities for professional development and training. The most notable organizations for ensemble librarians are: * Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA): The Major Orchestra Librarians' Association, founded in 1983, is composed of nearly 250 professional performance organizations around the world, represented by more than 400 librarians. MOLA facilitates communication between professional performance librarians, educates and assists them in providing service to their organizations, provides support and resources to the performing arts, and works with publishers to achieve the highest standards in music performance materials for the professional musician. Today, MOLA's membership includes symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, music academies, professional bands and other types of ensembles worldwide. * International Association of Music Libraries (IAML): Founded in 1951, the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres has around 2,000 individual and institutional members in around 45 countries. IAML works to promote international cooperation and to support the interests of the profession. It has national branches in 22 countries, five professional branches, four subject commissions and various working groups, and is responsible for several large-scale documentation projects. For the professional ensemble librarian, the Broadcasting and Orchestra Libraries Branch is the most essential of IAML's professional branches.  Issues  An ongoing issue in discussion among ensemble or performance librarians is the adequacy of available performance materials, in comparison to today's needs and standards required for professional use. Therefore, challenges arise, such as the deterioration of materials only available on a rental basis, the need to meet the recommended requirements for editing music in terms of format, size, page turns, etc.; the problem of errata present in many editions; the delivery of materials in digital format (common in the case of direct distribution from composers to the user), from which the librarian must then create physical parts for performance; the quality of service provided by music publishers and the accessibility of the information they provide; the emergence of digital music stands and the associated changes such media may bring. In addition to the typical concerns professional ensemble librarians face, another major issue is ensuring compliance with copyright laws. With the constant evolution of new technology, streaming performances on the Internet and other digital use of recorded music have become reality, and new forms of copyright-related questions therefore arise. For example, the performed work may be in the public domain where the orchestra originates, but may still be under copyright in some of the geographical areas where, for instance, a webcast may be accessible. The modern ensemble librarian is charged with the duty to self- educate regarding these new technological advances, in order to avoid violation of copyright law and to protect the organization for which they work.

The rehabilitation program covers primary rehabilitation, controlled return, and patient programs. The hospital has policlinics in Oslo and on Nesodden and runs laboratory research on the hospital's behalf. Research is a central part of the trust's work. The hospital has its own research department and uses both medical students and their own health personnel.

From the start, the institution had a strong working relationship with Ullev√•l Hospital (Oslo City Hospital) and got most of their patients from there. During the polio epidemic, with its culmination in 1951, young patients needed long treatment and rehabilitation, Sunnaas was asked to receive as many of them as his institution's capacity permitted. Sunnaas employing an experienced neurologist Nils Sponheim who thus was the first head medical doctor. He convinced the medical authorities in Oslo that the institution should be upgraded to hospital standard and deal with medical rehabilitation in cooperation with Oslo City Hospital. Over the following 20 years, Sponheim and a staff of doctors and physiotherapists made the hospital the country's foremost rehabilitation centre. The hospital continued to grow until 1975. At that point, it had 247 beds. Oslo municipality took over ownership as a gift from the Sunnaas couple in 1979, but the city authorities wanted the state to take over the financial responsibility for the hospital. This included a commitment to deal with more complicated illnesses. In 1995 Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital became a University hospital, and after the national hospital reforms of 2002, it became its own health trust in Helse √òst.

He graduated from St. Petersburg University with a law degree in 1889 and, declining an offer of training to become a professor at the University, he entered the Ministry of Finance in 1890 as an assistant to the Ministry's legal adviser. In 1896 he was initiated as a freemason in the French Cosmos Lodge. He was appointed a clerk in the General Office of the Ministry of Frinance in 1898. Putilov was made Acting Director of the General Office in 1900 and full Director of the General Office in 1902. On 28 October (9 November) 1905 he was named Deputy Minister of Finance, in which capacity he headed the Nobility State Land Bank and the State Peasant's Land Bank. In 1905 Putilov drew up a plan for the expansion of the peasants' freeholding, under which the landowners would sell a part of their estates. When Tsar Nicholas II rejected this scheme, Putilov resigned from government service on 24 April (7 May) 1906.  Banking career  In the private sector, Putilov became a member of the board of the Russo-Chinese Bank in 1906 and managing director in 1908. This bank was the largest shareholder of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Upon the merger in 1910 of the Russo-Chinese Bank with the Northern Bank to form the Russo-Asiatic Bank, he was elected chairman of the new institution, which soon became the largest private-sector bank in Russia. During the 1910-14 period Putilov organized the largest monopolies in Russia, including the Military Industrial Concern (\\"Russian Society for the Manufacture of Shells and Military Supplies\\"), the Russian Tobacco Trust, and the Russian General Oil Company, organized in 1912 to control all Russian oil production outside of the Nobel and Shell groups. Putilov was a member of the Board of Industry and Commerce, and during the First World War he was a member of the Special Supply Meeting of the Ministry of War.  Directorships  Putilov was the chairman or board member of the following companies in the 1910-1917 period: * Russo- Asiatic Bank * Putilov WorksBesides a shipyard and an artillery foundry, during Tsarist times the Putilov Works produced over half of the railway rolling stock in the Russian Empire.

Marx Publishing House Partnership  Revolution and exile  Following the abdication of Nicholas II in 1917, Putilov and V.I. Vyshnegradsky organized the Society for the Economic Revival of Russia. Putilov actively supported General Lavr Kornilov, whose coup attempt in September 1917 (N.S.) was a failure. Putilov was a member of the Provisional Council of the Russian Republic, which convened in Petrograd on 7 (20) October 1917. Following the Bolshevik coup of 25 October (7 November) 1917, the Provisional Council was dissolved, All assets of the Russo-Asiatic Bank within Russia were nationalized by the Bolshevik government. Putilov left for Harbin, in Manchuria, which was the center of the economic base of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. His elder son Sergei had previously left for Paris, while the remainder of the family remained at their home in Petrograd at 11 Mytninskaya Embankment. In his absence, all of Putilov's properties, movable and unmovable, were confiscated by decree of the Council of People's Commissars on 30 December 1917 (12 January 1918). In the spring of 1918 Putilov's wife Vera, daughter Ekaterina, granddaughter, and younger son Ivan were able to escape to Finland and thence to Paris. In the meantime, in Harbin Putilov collaborated with Leytenant-General (Lieutenant-General) Dmitry Khorvat, the head of the Chinese Eastern Railway, in maintaining \\"White\\" Russian control of the railway and providing financial assistance to the anti-Bolshevik \\"Armed Forces in the South of Russia,\\" led by General Pyotr Wrangel.\\"Former Foreign Colonies and Major Concessions in China.\\" http://worldstatesmen.org/China_Foreign_colonies.html\\"Russian Civil War polities.\\" http://worldstatesmen.org/Russia_war.html\\"Chinese Eastern line: history of construction and operation.\\" http://old.transsib.ru/Eng/history- kvzd.htm Putilov then joined his family in Paris, where he restored the activities of the Russo-Asiatic Bank on the basis of its foreign branches, with its main office in Paris. In 1921 he negotiated with Leonid Krasin about the possibility of creating a Soviet-French issuing bank to help the Soviet government carry out monetary reforms. Nothing came of the discussions, but when they were publicized and misrepresented by the emigre press in 1926, Putilov was forced to resign as chairman of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. He was succeeded by Knyaz (Prince) Sergei Kudashev. The bank failed on 26 September 1926 after losing some five million pounds in speculation in the Paris financial market, and was finally liquidated in 1928. Putilov died in Paris on 2 June 1940.  Family  Putilov married Vera Alexandrovna Zeyfart (German: Wera Seyfert), daughter of Lieutenant-General Alexander Alexandrovich Zeyfart (1835-1918). They were the parents of four children: * Ekaterina (married name Rosalion-Soshalskaya) * Sergei * Maria (died 12 (25) May 1912, having taken a fatal dose of arsenic after her father disapproved of the man she loved; her beloved shot himself near the home of the Putilov family on Mytninskaya Embankment) * Ivan (12 (25) December 1902 - 18 May 1977)  Further reading  * V.I.

The company's products are widely used within domestic settings, professional studios and other hi-fi applications. The company is one of a handful to have won an Emmy award in recognition of its \\"contribution to recording excellence\\".http://pmc- speakers.com/about/pmc-history History PMC was formed by Peter Thomas (previously of the BBC) and Adrian Loader (previously of FWO Bauch, an audio distributor) in 1990. They produced their first loudspeaker, the BB5-A, which was a large studio monitor. The first production versions were sold to the BBC and Metropolis Studios. The BBC still use the BB5 at the Maida Vale studios, and uses other PMC speakers in other locations as well. Metropolis now has around fifteen of them installed at its recording and mastering facility in West London. Notable users of the BB5 include Prince and Stevie Wonder's Wonderland Studio. PMC was awarded an Emmy Award for their recording work. Technology PMC uses \\"Advanced Transmission Line\\" technology in all of their loudspeakers. This is a means of loading a drive unit in a cabinet in such a way as to absorb the unwanted frequencies that radiate from the rear of the speaker driver. The speaker is mounted at the end of a folded line within the cabinet, which is lined with foam of varying absorbency. The lowest frequencies are allowed to pass through the line and emerge in phase from a vent on the front or rear face of the cabinet, in effect acting as a second bass driver. By absorbing the unwanted bass frequencies, the upper bass and midrange are not masked by harmonic distortion. The ATL design enables the speakers to produce higher sound pressure levels and deeper bass extension than is possible with similar sized speakers using either ported or sealed cabinets. The speakers can also be played at lower volumes without any loss of frequency response. Products PMC manufacturers products for both hi-fi and studio use. The hi-fi products originally grew out of the studio designs. The company also makes a range of on-wall speakers called the Wafer series. These also use the folded transmission line and are voiced identically to the traditional box speakers.

His is said to be the first to acclimatise legitimate opera in England. Life His father was William Clayton. He studied in Italy, from about 1702 to about 1704, bringing with him (as was said at the time) a considerable quantity of Italian songs which he had collected abroad. These he set to an adaptation by Peter Anthony Motteux of a drama by Stonzani, which had been performed at Bologna in 1677, and at Venice in 1678. In association with Nicola Haym and Charles Dieupart, Clayton entered upon a series of opera performances at Drury Lane Theatre ‚Äî the first venture of the kind in the annals of the English stage. The first season began on Tuesday, 16 Jan. 1705, with Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus, the work which Clayton had vamped up from his Italian gleanings. It was announced as 'a new opera, after the Italian manner, all sung,' with recitatives instead of spoken dialogue. It seems to have attained some success, though a contemporary writer (supposed to be Galliard) says 'there is nothing in it but a few sketches of antiquated Italian airs, so mangled and sophisticated, that instead of Arsinoe, it ought to be called the Hospital of the old Decrepid Italian Operas,' and Burney was inclined to acquit Clayton of plagiarism in its composition, for 'nothing so mean in melody and incorrect in counterpoint was likely to have been produced by any of the reigning composers of that time.' It was sung by Richard Leveridge, Hughes, Ramondon, Good, Mrs. Lindsay, Mrs. Cross, and Mrs. Tofts, the last of whom made in it her first appearance on the stage. On 6 February 1705, it was played at St. James's Palace before Queen Anne, at the celebration of her birthday ; according to Genest it was performed fifteen, or according to Burney twenty-four times in 1705, and thirteen times in 1706. The opera has been described as the first English opera in the Italian style. Encouraged by this success, Clayton tried his hand at another opera, and on Tuesday, 4 March 1707, produced at Drury Lane a setting of Addison's Rosamond, in which Holcomb, Leveridge, Hughes, Mrs. Tofts, Mrs. Lindsay, and Maria Gallia sang the principal parts. This work was repeated on the 15th and 22nd of the same month, but its failure was so decided that it was never again performed. The anonymous author already quoted opines that 'Rosamond 'mounted the stage on purpose to frighten all England with its abominable musick.' Both Arsinoe and Rosamond were published, and posterity has thus been enabled to endorse the opinions of Clayton's contemporaries. After the failure of 'Rosamond' the operatic venture continued until 1711. He was also the proprietor of a concert room at his house in the York Buildings of London (near The Strand), where he, Charles Dieupart, and Nicola Haym organized concert performances of his later works. They were advertised for subscription series in 1711 and 1712, but it is unclear how many of them were actually performed there.McGeary (1998) On 24 May 1711, settings by Clayton of a version of Dryden's Alexander's Feast (altered by John Hughes), and of Harrison's Passion of Sappho, were performed, but both works failed, after which nothing is heard of the luckless composer. He is said to have died about 1730. Assessment Clayton is of importance in the history of English music as the first to acclimatise legitimate opera in England, but as a composer his position is summed up in the words of his anonymous contemporary : 'If a reward was to be ordain'd for him that made the worst musick in all the world, the author of Rosamond wou'd have reason to say he had not lost his labour, since he wou'd have an undoubted title to the gratification.' Works In addition to his 1710 cantatas with text by John Hughes, Clayton's works include: *Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus ‚Äì opera in three acts, libretto by Peter Motteux after Tomaso Stanzani (premiered London, 1705) *Rosamond ‚Äì opera in three acts, libretto by Joseph Addison (premiered London, 1707) *A Pastoral Mask (1710) *If Wine and Music have the Power ‚Äì text by Matthew Prior (London, 1711) *The Feast of Alexander ‚Äì libretto by John Hughes after John Dryden (London, 1711) *The Passion of Sappho ‚Äì text by William Harrison (London, 1711) *Ode for the Prince's Birthday (London, 1711) *Ode on the King (London, 1716) Notes and references ;Attribution Sources *De Lafontaine, Henry Cart (1909).

The investigation led by the police, as well as the prosecutor, has been criticized repeatedly. Aftermath The case of the kidnapping and murder of Jaros≈Çaw Ziƒôtara is the only such case in the history of Poland after the fall of communism in 1989.

Synopsis In the summer of 1964, the author left behind the popular culture of the \\"Swinging Sixties\\" in England, a time when many were journeying to the East in search of spiritual enlightenment. In the book, he contrasts that hippie subculture with the \\"bombs and guns and [Sufi] mysticism\\" which he encountered on his own travels in Algeria. Reception In the Financial Times, Rory MacLean writes that the author \\"has given retrospective shape to his youth and formed a true story that will last forever, or at least until the pages of this wonderful, bittersweet memoir crumble into dust.\\" Steve Jelbert writes in The Independent that \\"the sheer strangeness of Irwin's quest [...] impresses. He goes on to say that \\"Irwin's witty, casually erudite tribute to his clever, na√Øve youth shows that there are no short cuts to wisdom. But it often comes with age.\\" Mick Brown, writing in Literary Review is of the opinion that \\"Irwin brilliantly conjures the mood of the late Sixties, with its blind innocence, fanciful enthusiasms and blissful music.\\" In the New Statesman, John Gray writes that \\"Robert Irwin begins one of the most delightfully diverting explorations of the byways of memory to have appeared in many years - and one of the most profound\\" and finds \\"the core of the book [to be] a sincere spiritual search, recounted with rare candour and arresting insight.\\" Writing in The Spectator, Anthony Sattin finds the book \\"a more enlightening type of memoir\\" than what he sees as the current fad of the \\"misery memoir\\". Sattin describes the work as \\"haunting\\" and goes on to say that the book \\"conveys with power and eloquence the writer's gratitude for having nourished the spiritual side of life and his disapproval of the way that many Muslims today interpret the Qur'an.\\" See also *Arabist *Dervish *Orientalism References External links *Memoirs of a Dervish at Profile Books 2011 non-fiction books British autobiographies British memoirs Sufi literature Dervish ","title":"Memoirs of a Dervish"},{"id":"31555247","text":"Advocate B.

Only the ruined core of the structure remains today. History Walden Castle was built in the town of Saffron Walden in Essex at the start of the civil war known as the Anarchy by Geoffrey de Mandeville, with much of the work occurring between 1141 and 1143.Pettifer, p.76; \\"Saffron Walden Castle\\", Gatehouse website, accessed 21 April 2011. It was one of several castles built by de Mandeville to reinforce his power across the region.Pettifer, p.76. The castle stood on a natural high point within the town () and had a square Norman keep and bailey wall, forming a substantial fortification. Geoffrey de Mandeville was arrested under questionable circumstances by King Stephen in 1143, and ordered to hand over his castles, including Walden; de Mandeville initially agreed, but reneged on the agreement once released and launched a military campaign against the king's strongholds in Cambridgeshire in an attempt to free the route south to Walden.Bradbury, pp.143‚Äì5. Geoffrey de Mandeville died during a siege the following year (in Burwell) Hadfield, J. (1970). The Shell Guide to England. London: Michael Joseph. , still not having reclaimed Walden.Bradbury, p.146. It is told in the Gesta Stephani that, when de Mandeville was dispossessed, Stephen had placed the castle and its domains in the custody (but not the possession) of Turgisius de Abrinciis (de Avranches), one of his most trusted men. Turgis had witnessed Stephen's charter by which de Mandeville was created hereditary Count of Essex,J.H. Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville. A Study of the Anarchy (Longman's, Green & Co., London 1892), pp. 51-53. and with him had witnessed the king's confirmation charter to Monk's Horton Priory in Kent.Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, p. 158. Turgis also witnessed Stephen's charter of 1139 to Salisbury,W.R. Jones and W.D. Macray (eds), Charters and Documents Illustrating the History of the Cathedral, City and Diocese of Salisbury, Rolls Series (HMSO, London 1891), pp. 10-11, Charter XII.For other charters witnessed see H.A.

Although he had received many benefits from the king, in 1145 he refused to surrender the castle to him, until one day the king with a large force surprised him while he was out hunting, and threatened to hang him in chains over the castle gate.R.C. Sewell (ed.), Gesta Stephani, Regis Anglorum, et Ducis Normannorum, incerto auctore (London 1846), pp. 110-11. Henry II ordered the castle, with the keep probably still unfinished, to be slighted in 1157. Saffron Walden's streets are shaped by the outline of the castle bailey. Only the ruined core of the castle remains, with most of the stones stolen over the intervening centuries; the castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.\\"Saffron Walden Castle\\", Gatehouse website, accessed 21 April 2011.

Originally the rocks in which they were found were considered to be late Silurian in age; more recently they have been found to be Early Devonian (Pragian, around ). Specimens consist only of incomplete leafless stems, some of which bore groups of spore-forming organs or sporangia which were fused, at least at the base. Source of fossils Fossils of Yarravia were found at a location called the 'Yarra Track', near to the town of Wood's Point, Victoria, Australia. The shale in which they were found, now called the Wilson Creek Shale, was for many years regarded as of late Silurian age. The dating was based on graptolite fossils which were identified as Monograptus uncinatus, which is of early Ludlow age (around ). These were subsequently described as a new species, M. thomasi, which proved to be of Early Devonian age (Pragian, around ). Rocks of Silurian age do occur in the region and the fossil plant Baragwanathia has been found from both late Silurian and the Early Devonian strata. However, Yarravia was found only in the Devonian shales. Fossils collected near Rebreuve, Pas-de-Calais Department, northern France, were named Yarravia minor by Danz√©-Corsin in 1956. The strata in which they were found were initially considered Pragian, but are now thought to be Emsian (from around ). Description Only the uppermost parts of Yarravia have been found in Australia. The stems (axes) were bare, around 2 to 2.5 mm in diameter. The longest pieces were up to 7.5 cm in length. No examples of branching were seen. The internal structure of the stems is not preserved. The sporangia were borne in a group at the ends of stems. The specimens are flattened, so that the original shape is not entirely clear, but up to five or six upright elongated sporangia appear to have been radially arranged on a base formed by a widening of the stem; there may have been a central space. At the base the sporangia are fused together, but their tips may be free. The entire structure can be described as a 'synangium'. Blackened material inside the sporangia was assumed to have been spores. Two species were described from the Australian material. In Y. oblonga, the synangium (the group of fused sporangia) was longer than wide, being about 7 mm long by 1.25 mm wide. The tips of the sporangia were free and appear to consist of tissue not containing spores. The synangium of Y. subsphaerica was significantly larger and as long as wide, being about 1 cm in length and width. The tips of the sporangia were less prominent. Taxonomy The genus Yarravia was named in 1935 by Lang and Cookson, based on fossils found in an Australian locality they called the 'Yarra Track'. Two species were named, Y. oblonga and Y. subsphaerica, referring to the shape of the sporangial heads. Phylogeny The relationships of Yarravia are uncertain. The genus Hedeia, of similar age, which is known from both Australia and China, had a similar radial cluster of sporangia at the tips of stems; the two genera are distinctive in this way compared to plants from other regions. It has been suggested that Yarravia may simply be Hedeia in a different state of preservation, and that Yarravia is not really synangial.See e.g. Hao & Gensel (1995) op. cit. p. 906. Both genera have been treated as 'rhyniophytes', although other studies regard their placement as uncertain.

The fungus is a habitat colonist with a preference for airborne alcohol, earning it the nickname whiskey fungus.  Description  Baudoinia compniacensis can be identified by its black, effused mycelium that can be velvety or crust-like. It features hyphae which are vegetative, dark brown, thick-walled, and often moniliform; although it lacks distinctive conidiophores. Conidiogenous cells can be found integrated within vegetative hyphae. Its conidia are dry, nonseptate or uniseptate, at the median. The conidia are thick-walled, globose to barrel-shaped, brown to black, and typically found with coarse surface ornamentation, dehiscing by schizolysis. Ramoconidia are absent. Colonies on MLA grow slowly and are dark in pigmentation. Synanamorphs are absent during its asexual reproduction stages. The presence of teleomorphs is unknown.  Nutrition  Baudoinia species use ethanol for their carbon nutrition, however growth rates suggest that this is not their only source of calories. Ethanol in vapour form also accelerates the growth of the fungus and stimulates spore germination. The ability to withstand high temperatures and therefore colonize habitats such as roofing, may be explained by the observation that ethanol vapour stimulates the formation of special heat-protective proteins that prevent cells from being killed under these relatively extreme conditions.  Ecology  Baudoinia compniacensis is black in colour and is partly responsible for the frequently observed phenomenon of 'Warehouse Staining', reported originally from the walls of buildings near brandy maturation warehouses in Cognac, France. Baudoinia compniacensis is a cosmopolitan colonist of outdoor surfaces subjected to extreme daily temperature shifts, elevated high relative humidity, periodic wetting, and ambient airborne ethanol. It is known from a wide range of substrates. For example, the UAMH Centre for Global Microfungal Biodiversity lists isolates recovered from tree bark, concrete, PVC plastic, galvanized roofing, masonry, and stone. Baudoinia compniacensis is not uniquely associated with spirit maturation and manufacture as one sample that was examined came from a commercial bakery, although the fermentation byproducts of yeast include ethanol and its vapors. Ethanol vapor appears to be important in habitat determinant and Baudoinia species may occur in association with natural fermentative processes, such as seasonal fruit drops, bogs, natural composts, etc. B. compniacensis may also occur around places where automotive fuel is stored or transferred, as ethanol is required to be blended with gasoline in most countries. It has been recorded through the radula marks left following grazing, as a well utilized food source of snails and slugs.  Distribution  B. compniacensis was first investigated in 1872 when Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve and Casimir Roumegu√®re examined a black, sooty growth found on the walls and roof tiles of buildings near distilleries in Cognac, France at the instigation of the French pharmacist, Antonin Baudoin. It has been widely recorded in Asia, Europe and the Americas.  B. compniacensis on buildings and plants  Although the fungus forms a coating layer on tree bark, this slow growing species does not seem to harm the plants by blocking the lenticels or significantly reduce their growth rates. Deciduous species also have the extra benefit of developing new leaves annually. The fungus can be removed from buildings using high pressure water jets, bleach, etc. It has not been shown to cause anything other than cosmetic effects thanks to its mode of nutrition via the carboniferous atmosphere, rather than the decay of building materials in general. Mosses, lichens and algae also grow on solid vertical surfaces, and slopes in the same fashion as the Angel's Share fungus and do not damage the infrastructure of built structures.

The completed assembly is 21.88 Mb in size.  Related fungi  The most closely related ascomycetes to Baudoinia compniacensis appear to be members of the genera Friedmanniomyces and Trimmatostroma. Friedmanniomyces species are rock-inhabiting species known only from the Antarctic. This fits in well with the observed fact that the species favours surfaces that are subjected to great environmental exposure, as in roofing materials that experience extreme diurnal fluctuations in ambient conditions.

He was born Philip Lane Stewart II, in the South Side suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. Laney has penned, produced and published hits for some of the biggest names in R&B;, hip hop and pop music over the past three decades. In addition to his individual achievements, he also has a proven ear and consistent track record of recognizing and developing unknown talent on their way to success. The long list of hits he has created, published and or managed is a testament to both his creative and business acumen.Peermusic.com Early life Laney had a mother, Mary Ann Stewart, who was a successful singer in her own right, having sung backgrounds for the Ohio Players, Curtis Mayfield and Aretha Franklin. His uncle, Morris \\"Butch\\" Stewart was a successful musician and producer. By age nine, Laney had taught himself how to play piano and drums. With the advertising business booming in Chicago, Laney started singing on jingles at the age of 12. As a teenager, he made the transition to writing and composing with a career doing his own jingles. By 15, he had his first commercially released songs on CBS Records with Ramsey Lewis' \\"This Ain't No Fantasy.\\" At the age of 16, he became a regular in the burgeoning Chicago underground house music scene, and became one of the early house producers, producing songs for Arrogance such as, \\"Crazy,\\"http://www.discogs.com/Arrogance-Crazy/release/194519 which was released on DJ International Records in 1986. Eventually, Laney began working as a session musician with his uncle, Wayne Stewart, Tony Brown and Patrick Leonard. Laney's most significant keyboard influence was Leonard, who was known for his work with Madonna, \\"Like a Prayer\\" etc. By 18, Stewart and partner Kenneth Hale formed their own jingle company, Minute Men, composing popular spots for Bud Light, McDonald's and Coca-Cola. They became the \\"go to\\" guys for urban based spots for advertising juggernauts like the Burrell ad agency and DDB Needham. They even won an award for their work on the California Lottery ad campaign. He was doing House clubs at night, jingle sessions and meetings with ad executives by day. 1988 to 1998 In 1988, with the help of ad executive and acclaimed author, Michelle McKinney Hammond, Laney signed his first publishing deal with Famous Music (now Sony/ATV Music Publishing). Within the first couple years of his deal, Laney had linked up with songwriting partner, Tony Haynes, for a string of placements and would wisely upgrade his deal to a joint venture with Famous Music. With a publishing deal and a machine behind him, he decided to focus his career on working with recording artists instead of jingles. In 1990, he & Tony Haynes formed The Groove Asylum, which soon put him in the studio working with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who had a tremendous influence on Laney's songwriting and production style. With his dual roles at Groove Asylum and Famous, he was co- producing songs with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, in addition to working with well-known recording artists. At the same time he was fine-tuning his business savvy by signing a group of young writers to his production company, including his younger brother, Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart Tricky Stewart, Kuk Harrell and Sean Hall. He brought his other younger brother Mark E. Stewart and future sister in-law Judi into the company as well, on the business side. Laney's next big influence would be legendary MCA Records executive, Louil Silas Jr., who was won over by Laney's abilities. Before he knew it, he would be working with execs like Sylvia Rhone, Benny Medina and Quincy Jones, putting together a run of successful songs, including \\"Never Let Them See You Sweat\\" by Go West, which was featured in White Men Can't Jump, and \\"Candlelight and You\\" by Keith Washington featuring Chante Moore, which was featured in House Party 2. In 1992 Stewart relocated his company from Chicago to Los Angeles, CA and would eventually become a founding partner, along with his brothers Tricky and Mark, in RedZone Entertainment in 1994. In 1996 Laney entered into a publishing deal and writing/production relationship with Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds and his Edmonds Music Publishing company. Babyface's songwriting guidance had a major influence on Laney's. This high-powered relationship led him to work with Madonna, Shanice, and Tony! Toni! Ton√©! in addition to writing and producing songs for the feature film Soul Food. During this time he also wrote and produced the top 10 hit \\"Last Nights Letter\\" for K-Ci & JoJo‚Äôs Quadruple platinum album Love Always . Redzone and Atlanta In 1999 Laney relocated to Atlanta GA to join his brothers as a partner in RedZone Entertainment and Triangle Sound Studios. RedZone RedZone Entertainment helped put Atlanta on the map as a music city over the next few years with hits like Blu Cantrell's \\"Hit ‚ÄòEm Up Style,\\"http://blogs.centrictv.com/music/soulsessions/tag/laney-stewart/ Sole's \\"4,5,6\\", TLC's \\"No Scrubs\\", Toni Braxton's \\"Love Me Some Him,\\" and Destiny's Child's \\"Bills, Bills, Bills.\\" Laney eventually took over the position of president of RedZone, which included overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company and keeping it active. Under his watch super hit songwriter, Ester Dean, was also added to Redzone on the Publishing side. With his dual role as music executive and producer, Laney continued his work penning and producing hit songs including, # 1 A.C. smash \\"Without You\\" by Charlie Wilson, and \\"Everything\\" which appears on multi-platinum selling B2K‚Äôs Pandemonium and Greatest Hits albums. Publisher In his role as a publisher, Laney flourished amassing a huge publishing catalog that rivals anyone's. Unlike a lot of Publishers, he actually worked hands on with the writers, developing their skills and growing the catalog. Laney mentored Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, Kuk Harrell, and Sean Hall, imparting on them the secrets to consistent hitmaking that had been passed down to him from Jam & Lewis and Babyface amongst others. In addition to some of Tricky's songs, Laney's publishing includes songs performed by Britney Spears, Usher, Pink, Sisqo, Toni Braxton, Tyrese, and the 1999 the ASCAP Rap song of the year, \\"Who Dat\\" by JT Money, which reached #5 on the Billboard pop charts. One of the biggest R&B; tracks in the catalog is \\"I Love Me Some Him\\" off of Toni Braxton's \\"Secrets\\" album, which went 8 x Platinum. \\"Me Against The Music\\" stands out in the catalog as a duet with Britney Spears and Madonna that peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and was recently featured on an episode of Fox's \\"Glee.\\" Pink's \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" added a double platinum plaque to Laney's publishing collection along with platinum and double platinum sales worldwide as well. Other pop hits included \\"Case of the Ex\\" by M√Ωa, which peaked at number two in its 16th week on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at #1 on Billboard's R&B; chart. It spent 3 weeks at number two and 29 consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was also an international success. In 1999 there was 3LW‚Äôs \\"No More\\" and in 2001 there was B2K‚Äôs premier smash \\"Uh- Huh,\\" which was the number one selling Single in the U.S that year. The- Dream and Morningside Trail Music Laney's next step as an entrepreneur would be entering into another publishing joint venture with Peer Music,Peermusic.com/peermusic/index.cfm forming Morningside Trail Music in 2003. He discovered, developed and then signed writer/producer Terius \\"The- Dream\\" Nash.http://jnelj.wordpress.com/category/laney-stewart/ A year after an unsuccessful initial meeting, The-Dream was able to impress Laney enough to get back in the studio with him. Their first night of working together resulted in the song, \\"Everything,\\" which ended up on B2K's album. Laney worked hard to develop The-Dream's songwriting abilities and consistency. Under Laney's tutelage The-Dream has developed into an award-winning super writer/producer and recording artist with hits like \\"Shawty is the S*^!\\" and \\"Falsetto.\\" Laney first introduced The-Dream to his brother Tricky and that partnership lead to a list of hits, from Rihanna's \\"Umbrella,\\" J. Holiday's \\"Bed\\" and \\"Suffocate,\\" to Mariah Carey's \\"Touch My Body,\\" Usher's \\"Moving Mountains,\\" Mary J. Blige's \\"Just Fine,\\" & Justin Bieber's \\"Baby,\\" and Beyonc√©'s \\"Single Ladies.\\" 2005 to present In 2005, Laney had to take a break after learning he was suffering from kidney cancer and failure. Laney took time to evaluate the evolving music business climate and in 2009 he, along with his wife, formed Stewart Music Group, combining publishing, production and management. In 2010 was blessed to receive a transplant kidney from his wife and while still in the hospital recuperating from transplant surgery he finalized the deal for a new joint venture with Universal Music Publishing Group , the largest music publishing company in the world. Laney is now developing a new publishing catalog under Music Gallery and a new writing/production team called The SharpShootaz, was his first signing. Each writer in The Sharpshootaz was hand picked by Laney himself, including Alex Jacke,http://allhiphop.com/2012/07/17/something-new-crooner-alex-jacke- releases-d-f-m-a-thrill-ride-for-lovers Romika Faniel, Derek Yopp, Andrew Kim and Sidney Miller. In late 2011, The Sharpshootaz got in the studio with Jesse McCartney and recorded several songs, including \\"Out Of Words,\\" which was leaked to the internet in July 2012. On July 9, 2012, Laney and The Sharpshootaz released an Alex Jacke EP called, \\"D.F.M.\\" The SharpShootaz continue to work on music for more of today's hottest artists. Stewart Music Group currently consists of Music Gallery/UMPG Publishing, \\"The System\\" Management and Consulting, and LS Productions. Laney continues to be an important figure in the industry. Personal life Laney lives in Los Angeles, California and is married to Khaila Stewart with three children, Jordan, Clarke and Christopher. Laney and Khaila are involved in research at UCLA for kidney disease and living donor transplants.

The identification of the Christian holy sites became of increased importance especially from around the time of Constantine the Great of the Roman Empire. Interest was also strong during Emperor Charlemagne, as was also the case during the Crusades, when Christian pilgrims often sought out holy places in the Outremer, especially in early 12th century immediately after the capture of Jerusalem.Sean Martin, The Knights Templar: The History & Myths of the Legendary Military Order, 2005. The search for the Christian holy places was the foundation of 19th-century European Biblical archaeology in Ottoman Syria and later in the British Mandate Palestine. The holy sites in cities for Christians of all denominations are: Jerusalem * The Golgotha sometimes called Calvary: hill outside of ancient Jerusalem‚Äôs early 1st century walls that contains the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Church of All Nations, but many other Christian institutions as well. Jerusalem is believed to be the site of some of Jesus's teaching, the Last Supper which is believed to have occurred at the Cenacle, and the subsequent institution of the Holy Eucharist as well as His entombment; Christians believe he was crucified on a nearby hill. * the city of Bethlehem with the Church of the Nativity is believed to mark the birthplace of Jesus, and also the Shepherd's Fields in the neighboring village of Beit Sahour, the location of the angel's visitation to the shepherds to announce the birth of Christ. * Church of the Annunciation in Basilica and Mary's Well in Nazareth which is believed to be Jesus's hometown, and the site of other holy places. * Sephoria (Sepphoris), where the Virgin Mary was said to have spent her childhood. * Cave dwelling of John the Baptist.

Early life Kingston was born in Islington in London, the daughter of merchant Heiman Kohnstamm and his wife, Teresina (n√©e Friedmann), who were Jewish.William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 519 She was the sister of legal author and county court judge Edwin Max Konstam (1870‚Äì1956), born as Edwin Max Kohnstamm. Kingston was privately educated and travelled extensively with her mother and governess. She studied painting in Berlin and Paris and later published three illustrated books. Her first theatrical experience was as a child, performing amateur impersonations of famous actors of the day such as Henry Irving and Sarah Bernhardt. Aged fifteen W. S. Gilbert selected her to play the lead in an amateur production of Broken Hearts. On her marriage in 1889 to Captain George Silver (1858/9‚Äì1899) of the East Surrey Regiment, Kingston decided to become a professional actress to support herself and her husband financially. Ellen Terry suggested that Kingston should enrol in the School of Acting run by actor-manager Sarah Thorne in Margate, and for whom she played Ophelia in Hamlet and Emilia in Othello.Kate Steedman, 'Kingston, Gertrude (1862‚Äì1937)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 . Retrieved 21 April 2011 At this time she also played Penelope in the English-language versions of The Tale of Troy and Clytemnestra in Aeschylus' Agamemnon. Theatrical career Gertrude Kingston in the title role in Lysistrata (1910) In 1894 she appeared in The Charlatan at the Haymarket Theatre for Robert Buchanan.The Penny Illustrated Paper 27 January 1894 ‚Äì p.58 Joining the company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree she played Mrs Harkaway in Partners, following which she became in great demand on the London stage, going on to appear as Clara Dexter in The Woodbarrow, which she also produced, and Mrs Graves in A Matchmaker, which she wrote with Clotilde Graves. The latter play gained a certain notoriety when it was criticised for comparing marriage to prostitution. On the death of her husband in 1899, just before the start of the Boer War, Kingston raised subscriptions to open a nursing hut for British troops in South Africa; some accounts of her life claim that she went to South Africa herself and worked in her hospital as a nurse, a claim not substantiated in her autobiography, in which she wrote that she was persuaded not to go.Kingston, Gertrude Curtsey While You're Thinking Williams & Norgate, London (1937) She remained active in the theatre over the next decade; in 1905 at the Royal Court Theatre she played Helen in the tragedy The Trojan Women by Euripides, and Aurora Bompas in Bernard Shaw's How He Lied to Her Husband opposite Harley Granville-Barker.MacCarthy, Desmond The Court Theatre, 1904‚Äì1907; a Commentary and Criticism Also in 1905 her portrait in charcoal was executed by John Singer Sargent. In 1910 she became the lessee and actor-manager of the Little Theatre in the Adelphi in London. Her opening season was inspired by the Royal Court Theatre's introduction of serious and classical drama to a commercial audience, and therefore she opened with Aristophanes' Lysistrata, in which she played the title role.Edith Hall and Amanda Wrigley (editors), Aristophanes in Performance 421 BC‚ÄìAD 2007 Modern Humanities Research Association and Maney Publishing Legenda: Oxford, 2007 In 1911 Lillah McCarthy took over the lease of the Little Theatre, and Kingston returned to that theatre under McCarthy's management to play Madame Arcadina in The Seagull. Also in 1912 Kingston played Lady Cecily Waynflete in Captain Brassbound's Conversion. Then in 1913 George Bernard Shaw wrote the title role in his play Great Catherine for her.Shaw, George Bernard Preface to Great Catherine (1972) Later years Kingston was in the United States for much of World War I where she gave talks about the war effort in Britain. In Boston she appeared in three plays by Shaw, including Great Catherine. In 1916 she appeared with her own theatrical company in The Queen's Enemies, and in four plays by Shaw: The Inca of Perusalem, Great Catherine, Overruled and How He Lied to Her Husband,The Gertrude Kingston Company on the Internet Broadway Database and played Ermyntrude in Shaw's The Inca of Perusalem with the Pioneer Players, the Women's suffrage theatre company; for some years she had been a speaker on behalf of the suffrage movement in Britain. She organised a war charities' revue in London in 1916 in aid of the Star and Garter Home. After World War I Kingston returned to Britain where she resumed her acting career, also becoming a regular speaker for the Conservative Party. In 1924 she considered standing for Parliament. She taught public speaking and became a journalist, writing on a variety of subjects. In 1927 an exhibition of her Lacquer work was held in New York City, her technique becoming known as 'Kingston lacquer'. Also in 1927 Kingston produced and appeared in Nevertheless in London. Her final performance was as Elizabeth I in When Essex Died in 1932. In 1937 her autobiography Curtsey While You're Thinking was published.

He travelled extensively throughout the Middle East and illustrated a number of books for the travel writer, Baron Taylor. Life and career Adrien Dauzats was born at Bordeaux in 1804. His father was a scenery painter at a Bordeaux theatre, and the boy grew up dreaming of becoming a scene painter.Thornton, L., The Orientalists, [Edition en langue anglaise], ACR edition, 1994, p.54 He became a pupil of Lacour at the √âcole de Dessin.Tinterow, G., Lacambre, G. and Rold√°n, F.L. Manet/Vel√°zquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2003, p. 75 He was a frequent exhibitor at the Salon of genre subjects and interiors of churches, and was also a lithographer. After completing his studies, in around 1829, he accompanied, Baron Taylor, a playwright, soldier and archaeologist to the Middle East and visited Egypt, Syria, Mount Sinai, Palestine and other locations,Tinterow, G., Lacambre, G. and Rold√°n, F.L. Manet/Vel√°zquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2003, p. 375 for the purpose of making illustrations for Baron Taylor's travel books, including: Voyages Pittoresques et Romantiques de l'ancienne France: 1820-63; Voyage Pittoresque en Espagne, en Portugal, et sur la c√¥te d'Afrique, de Tanger √† Tetouan: 1826-32; La Syrie, I'Egypte, la Palestine et la Jud√©e: 1835-39, and other books. After visiting Palestine, Syria, Mount Sinai and other locations, he began to produce works with Oriental themes. He was one of the first artists to paint the Orient \\"with scrupulous exactitude and impartiality.\\" Thornton, L., The Orientalists, [Edition en langue anglaise], ACR edition, 1994, p.54 Following his second trip to the Middle East, he published a book, Quinze Jours au Sinai, which he co-authored with the novelist, Alexandre Dumas Snr, in which Dauzat's artistic vision set it apart from other Dumas works, and also separated it from most other travel books of the period.Starkey, P. and Starkey, J., Travellers in Egypt, I.B.Tauris, 2001 p.184; Thornton, L., The Orientalists, [Edition en langue anglaise], ACR edition, 1994, p.54 On another trip to Spain in 1835, also with Baron Taylor, he met the engraver Pharamond Blanchard, who introduced Taylor and Dauzats to the prominent artistic de Madrazo family. Dauzats remained in Spain until 1837, met many prominent Spanish artists and developed an interest in Spanish art.Thornton, L., The Orientalists, [Edition en langue anglaise], ACR edition, 1994, p.54; Tinterow, G., Lacambre, G. and Rold√°n, F.L. Manet/Vel√°zquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2003, p. 180 During this trip (about 1839), Dauzats came to the attention of King Louis-Phillipe and accepted an invitation to accompany a military and diplomatic expedition to Algeria, with a brief to produce five watercolours of French military exploits.Macfie, A.L., Orientalism, Routledge, 2014, p. 64; Thornton, L., The Orientalists, [Edition en langue anglaise], ACR edition, 1994, p.55 This was to be one of his last voyages, but he continued to paint Orientalist themes long after his travelling days were over. In 1868, the artist accepted a commission to produce four illustrations of characters from the Arabian folktale, One Thousand and One Nights for a fixed price of 2,000 francs each. Madame Aldema, who commissioned the works, paid a 1,000 franc advance when the artist commenced the first work, Sinbad the Sailor, however, the artist died in Paris in 1868 before he could finish the work. There followed a curious litigation, where the artist's estate refused to hand over the unfinished work, on the grounds that his will had stipulated that incomplete works were not to be shown publicly. However, Madame Aldema was able to satisfy the court that the work had already been exhibited and was thus successful in taking ownership of the sketch.\\"Chroniques des Arts,\\" in The Academy and Literature, Volume 4, 1 July 1873, p. 247 After his death, Dauzat's sketchbooks, notably sketches of his travels with Baron Tayor, along with artworks, including some Spanish masterpieces and his extensive library were sold in an atelier sale at the H√¥tel Drouot, Paris in February, 1869.Tinterow, G., Lacambre, G. and Rold√°n, F.L.

It occurred during the French Revolution. During the night of 27 and 28 April 1796, a mail coach was ambushed outside Paris (commune of Vert-Saint-Denis) by several men who stole a large sum of money (7 million livres). The stage coach was supposed to go to Lyon from Paris, carrying money for the Army of Italy. Both the driver and the armed guard were brutally killed. A third man on board, travelling under an assumed name, participated in the killing and later vanished. Following investigations, six men (Etienne Couriol, Charles Gu√©not, Joseph Richard, Antoine Bruer, David Bernard and Joseph Lesurques) were arrested. After a trial, Couriol, Bernard and Lesurques were executed. Before his execution, however, Couriol claimed that Lesurques was innocent and was only arrested because he resembled Andr√© Dubosq, one of the actual attackers of the coach. Couriol's last denunciations also helped arrest other accomplices: Joseph Durochat, who travelled aboard the coach as \\"Laborde\\"; Pierre Vidal, who came up with the plan to rob the coach; and Louis Roussy, one of the killers. All of them were convicted and executed. Dubosq was also arrested and executed; however, his trial was not enough to overturn the judgement sentencing Lesurques, for all the witnesses who had recognised Lesurques persisted in saying that they had indeed seen Lesurques and not Dubosq. Lesurques' family spent most of the 19th century trying to rehabilitate him; but none of the various committees assembled to re-examine the case found sufficient grounds to clear Lesurques' name.Gaston Delayen, L'Affaire du Courrier de Lyon, 1905, p. 420 Nevertheless, Lesurques is widely believed to be innocent and this case is remembered in France for being a famous example of miscarriage of justice. In popular culture The story was turned into two notable plays, a French version by Paul Siraudin and Louis- Mathurin Moreau and the 1854 play The Courier of Lyons by Charles Reade. In 1877 he rewrote the play as The Lyons Mail for performance by Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in London. There have been numerous film adaptations of these two works. The case is featured in a 1937 French movie L'Affaire du courrier de Lyon. Reade's play was turned into a 1916 silent film The Lyons Mail and a sound version The Lyons Mail in 1931.

Critical reception Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated the song three and a half stars out of five, and wrote: \\"While her fellow Swedes Teddybears make frothy disco rock, Robyn coyly disses a drugged-up young woman. Call it a pinch of arsenic in a tequila shot.\\" Jason Newman of MTV Buzzworthy was concerned about a line in the song, writing, \\"we're slightly unnerved at countless 14-year-olds now mimicking the singer's request to 'Shake your bone maker'.\\" However, Newman wrote that \\"we can't deny the catchy, summer-ready vibe of the song.\\" Release history { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" +Release dates, record label and format details - !scope=\\"col\\" Country !scope=\\"col\\" Date !scope=\\"col\\" Format !scope=\\"col\\" Label - ! scope=\\"row\\" United States  rowspan=\\"2\\" 15 March 2011  rowspan=\\"2\\" Digital download  rowspan=\\"2\\" Big Beat, Atlantic - ! scope=\\"row\\" Canada } References External links * Teddybears songs Robyn songs 2011 singles Songs written by Klas √Öhlund Songs written by Joakim √Öhlund ","title":"Cardiac Arrest (Teddybears song)"},{"id":"31555560","text":"Stalag I-B Hohenstein was a German World War II prisoner-of-war camp located west of Hohenstein, East Prussia (now Olsztynek, Poland). The camp was partially located on the grounds of the Tannenberg Memorial and initially included a set of wooden structures intended to house World War I veterans during Nazi festivities. Established in 1939 to house Polish soldiers captured in the course of the September Campaign, with time it was extended to house also Belgians, French, Italian, Serbian and Soviet soldiers. Harsh conditions, malnutrition, maltreatment and recurring typhoid epidemics led to many deaths among the prisoners. Notably during the winter of 1941‚Äì42 roughly 25,000 people died there, mostly Soviet soldiers. It is estimated that altogether 650,000 people passed through this camp and its sub-camps. Between 50 and 55 thousand of them were buried in 500 mass graves at the Sudwa cemetery located nearby. The site is commemorated with a memorial stone by Ryszard Wachowski. Since 1980 the Olsztynek-based municipal museum hosts a small exhibition devoted to the camp and its inmates. Parts of the former camp were uncovered during construction of the S7 Expressway.

Harada and Kotoge have also worked together for various other promotions across Japan and for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania‚Äìbased Chikara in the United States. Early life Harada reportedly first got interested in professional wrestling through the video game Toukon Ratsuden, after which his first in‚Äìperson professional wrestling experience was attending the January 4, 1998, Final Power Hall in Tokyo Dome show, witnessing the conclusion of Riki Choshu's retirement tour. Harada began competing in amateur wrestling in his high school and ended up winning Osaka Prefecture's amateur wrestling championship at .

After working as a tag team for over a year, Harada and Kotoge were finally granted a shot at the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship on January 5, 2008, but were unsuccessful in their attempt at dethroning the defending champions, Bad Force (Gaina and Zero). Just a month later on February 11, the team came to an abrupt end, when Kotoge turned heel and joined Bad Force. Meanwhile, Harada formed a new partnership with Zeus, creating rival stable Blood & Guts, which was intended to highlight the promotion's younger performers. In March, Harada and Zeus accepted Tadasuke as the third member of the group. In May, Bad Force was dissolved, when the majority of its members jumped to splinter promotion Okinawa Pro Wrestling, after which Harada's former partner Atsushi Kotoge jumped to Blood & Guts. In June, Blood & Guts sent two teams into the 2008 Osaka Tag Festival, with Harada teaming with Zeus and Kotoge with Tadasuke. Both teams made it to the finals, where Harada and Zeus were victorious, after Harada pinned Kotoge with the Katayama German Suplex Hold.

Later that same day, Momo no Seishun Tag returned to Pro Wrestling Noah, where they teamed with Shane Haste to defeat Atsushi Aoki, Kotaro Suzuki and Taiji Ishimori in a six-man tag team match, afterwards challenging Aoki and Suzuki to a match for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On January 22, 2012, Momo no Seishun Tag failed to capture the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from Aoki and Suzuki. On January 28, Harada defeated Masamune to become the number one contender to the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. On February 26, Harada defeated Billyken Kid to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship for the first time. On March 25, Harada lost the title to Black Buffalo in his first title defense, ending his reign at 28 days, the shortest in the title's history. On April 29, Momo no Seishun Tag was officially disbanded, when Kotoge left Osaka Pro Wrestling to join Pro Wrestling Noah full-time. On May 26, Harada defeated Tadasuke in the finals of a tournament to earn a rematch for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. On July 7, Harada formed a new partnership with Tadasuke and Hayata, who had recently turned on Joker and were now looking to stop their former stable. On July 14, the new alliance was named \\"Glare\\". On July 22, Harada defeated Black Buffalo in the main event of Osaka Pro's largest annual event, Hurricane, to regain the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship, completing a clean sweep for Glare as earlier in the event Hayata and Tadasuke became the new Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions. On September 30, Harada made his first successful defense of the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship against Joker's newest member Quiet Storm. On October 21, Glare won the Osaka Pro Wrestling 6 Person Tag Tournament, defeating the Joker trio of Hideyoshi, Kuuga and Quiet Storm in the finals. In early December, Harada defeated Billyken Kid, Kengo Takai, and finally stablemate Hayata to advance to the finals of the 2012 Tenno-zan tournament. On December 16, Harada defeated Hub in the finals to win his second Tenno-zan in a row. On January 19, 2013, Glare defeated Black Buffalo, Kazuaki Mihara and Naoki Setoguchi in a six-man tag team main event. After the match, Harada revealed Buffalo as the newest member of Glare. On February 24, Harada, Buffalo, Hayata and Tadasuke of Glare faced Billyken Kid, Kazuaki Mihara, Naoki Setoguchi and Tigers Mask of the Osaka Pro Seikigun in an elimination match, where the losing team would be forced to disband. The match eventually came down to Harada and Billyken Kid and ended with Harada scoring the deciding pinfall, saving Glare and forcing Seikigun to disband. On March 2, Billyken Kid and Kazuaki Mihara joined Glare, announcing they now agreed with the stable's \\"revolution\\". Glare then declared war on Joker and Unique Gundan, the two remaining stables in Osaka Pro. The rivalry between Glare and Unique Gundan built to a four-on-four elimination match on March 24, where Harada, Hayata, Mihara and Tadasuke suffered an upset defeat at the hands of Ebessan, Kanjyuro Matsuyama, Kuishinbo Kamen and Takoyakida, with Ebessan scoring the last elimination over Harada. Afterwards, the two groups made peace with each other. On March 30, six top Osaka Pro wrestlers, including Harada and stablemate Hayata, announced that they were quitting the promotion. Harada announced that he was not going to re-sign with the promotion once his contract ran out on April 29, revealing that he was looking for a wrestling future in Tokyo. The announcement also led to him relinquishing the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. On April 29, Harada wrestled his final Osaka Pro match, where he, Hayata, Kazuaki Mihara and Tadasuke were defeated by Hideyoshi, Kuuga, Masamune and Orochi. After the match, Harada revealed that he was following his former partner Atsushi Kotoge to Pro Wrestling Noah. =Chikara (2010‚Äì2011)= 2010 King of Trios In April 2010, Harada along with Kotoge and their former Blood & Guts partner Tadasuke traveled to the United States to represent Osaka Pro in Chikara's 2010 King of Trios tournament. In their first round match in the tournament on April 23, Team Osaka Pro defeated The UnStable (Colin Delaney, Stigma and Vin Gerard), when Harada pinned Delaney with the Katayama German Suplex Hold. While Harada and Kotoge worked the tour as faces, Tadasuke worked as a heel, and in the following day's quarterfinal match, used his heel antics to eliminate the reigning King of Trios, F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Gran Akuma and Icarus), from the tournament by pinning Taylor, while holding his tights, thus sending Team Osaka Pro to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 25, Team Osaka Pro was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). Despite failing to win the tournament, Team Osaka Pro's strong showing had made them instant crowd favorites in Chikara. Fire Ant in April 2010 On March 1, 2011, Chikara announced that Harada and Kotoge would be returning to the promotion for the 2011 King of Trios, this time teaming with the reigning Osaka Pro Wrestling Battle Royal Champion Ultimate Spider Jr. On April 15, Team Osaka Pro defeated the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield, Matt Classic and Sugar Dunkerton) in their first round match. However, the following day, Team Osaka Pro was eliminated from the tournament by F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano), when Taylor pinned Spider Jr., while grabbing a hold of his tights, much like how Tadasuke had pinned him in the tournament the previous year. On April 17, the final day of the tournament, Harada and Kotoge entered a ten tag team gauntlet match. They entered the match as the eighth team, facing the Roughnecks (Brodie Lee and Grizzly Redwood), whom they eliminated when Kotoge pinned Redwood. After also eliminating team number nine, 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews), Harada and Kotoge faced off with representatives from rival promotion Dragon Gate, Kagetora and Super Shisa. In the end, Kotoge was able to score the deciding pinfall, earning Momo no Seishun Tag the victory and their third point, which guaranteed them a shot at the Campeonatos de Parejas, which was at the time held by Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On August 25, Chikara announced that Momo no Seishun Tag would return to cash their points on October 7, challenging brand new Campeones de Parejas, F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano), in a rubber match. On October 7 in Burlington, North Carolina, Momo no Seishun Tag failed to capture the Campeonatos de Parejas as they were defeated by Taylor and Gargano two falls to one, following interference from Icarus. The following day, Harada and Kotoge were defeated by Fire Ant and Soldier Ant at a show in Kingsport, Tennessee. =Pro Wrestling Noah (2013‚Äìpresent)= On May 2, 2013, Pro Wrestling Noah held a press conference, officially announcing that Harada had signed with the promotion. Harada wrestled his first match under a Noah contract on May 12, when he was defeated by former tag team partner Atsushi Kotoge in a singles match. Harada picked up his first win under a Noah contract on May 18, when he defeated rookie Hitoshi Kumano. Harada then hand-picked Kumano as his partner for the 2013 NTV G+ Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League, which was contested for the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship and took place between July 11 and 28. Despite eyeing a match with Atsushi Kotoge and Taiji Ishimori in the finals, Harada and Kumano ended up losing all four of their matches, failing to advance from their block. On August 24, Harada gained a measure of revenge on Kotoge by pinning him in a tag team match, where he and Kumano faced Kotoge and Ishimori. Later in the event, Harada and Kumano nominated themselves as the next challengers for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On September 7, Harada picked up a major singles win over one half of the reigning champions, NJPW representative Jyushin Thunder Liger. However, on September 16, Harada and Kumano failed to capture the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from Liger and Tiger Mask.

On January 3, 2014, Harada returned to NJPW, teaming with Hitoshi Kumano in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Jyushin Thunder Liger and Super Strong Machine. Harada started off his 2014 in Noah with a win over Atsushi Kotoge on January 5, after which he announced that he wanted to join the No Mercy stable. On January 12, though defeated by No Mercy leader Kenta in a singles match, Harada was accepted as the newest member of the stable. According to Harada, one of his main reasons for joining No Mercy was to continue chasing the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, held by Taiji Ishimori, who represented No Mercy's rival stable, Brave. On January 25, Harada pinned Ishimori in a six- man tag team match between No Mercy and Brave to earn another shot at his title.

After finishing their round-robin block with a record of three wins and one loss, Harada and Storm advanced to the finals on August 2, where they were defeated by Hajime Ohara and Kenoh. Harada avenged the loss against Ohara by pinning him in a three-way match, also involving Zack Sabre Jr., on August 17 to make his fourth successful defense of the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship. Harada continued making successful defenses of the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, defeating Shiori Asahi on September 21, Super Crazy on October 12, and Zack Sabre Jr. on November 4. Harada's reign ended on December 6, when he was defeated by Atsushi Kotoge in his eighth title defense.

From July 18 to August 5, Harada took part in the 2015 Global Junior Heavyweight League, where he won his block with a record of five wins and one loss, advancing to the finals, where he defeated Atsushi Kotoge to earn another shot at Taichi's title.

Momo no Seishun Tag formally disbanded on February 14, after Kotoge defeated Harada in a singles match. On February 18, Harada reunited with Tadasuke as the two stepped forward to challenge newly crowned GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions Hi69 and Taiji Ishimori. Three days later, Harada and Tadasuke came together with Hayata and Yo-Hey to form a new stable named Ratel's. On March 12, Harada and Tadasuke failed to capture the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from Hi69 and Ishimori. On October 1, Harada defeated Taiji Ishimori to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. Afterwards, Harada challenged his Ratel's stablemates Hayata and Yo-Hey to a match for their GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship with Tadasuke as his partner, leading to a match on October 28, where they were defeated by the champions. On November 19, he defeated Tadasuke for his first successful defense. On December 22, he defeated Minoru Tanaka to make his second defense. On January 27, he defeated Hajime Ohara for his third defense, afterwards accepting a challenge from his stablemate HAYATA.

She had previously been Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n, but was better known as Guipuzcoano, an armed merchantmen of the Spanish Basque Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. Guipuzcoano was sailing as the flagship of an escort for a merchant convoy of the company, when they ran into a large British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney, bound for the relief of Gibraltar. In a short action Rodney captured the entirety of the convoy and all its escorts, including the Guipuscoano, which he manned and named in honour of Prince William, sending her back to Britain with some of the merchants. The Navy approved her acquisition and after fitting out she was sent to the West Indies, where she took part in most of the battles there during the American War of Independence, including the capture of Sint Eustatius and the battles of Fort Royal, Saint Kitts and the Saintes. She returned to Britain after the end of the wars, was converted to a sheer hulk before the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, was a receiving ship by 1811 and was broken up in 1817, two years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Capture Guipuzcoano was sailing as the flagship of Commodore Don Juan Agust√≠n de Yardi, and commanded by Captain Don Tom√°s de Malay, in late 1779, escorting a convoy of 15 merchants of the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas from San Sebasti√°n to Cadiz. Also escorting the convoy were four company frigates, the 32-gun San Carlos, 30-gun San Rafael, 28-gun Santa Teresa and 26-gun San Bruno, and two smaller vessels, the 16-gun San Ferm√≠n and 10-gun San Vicente. On 8 January 1780 the convoy encountered a large British fleet off Cape Finisterre under Admiral Sir George Rodney, bound for the relief of Gibraltar. Rodney closed on the convoy, the copper sheathing on some of his ships allowing them to outsail the Spanish. The whole convoy was captured, with vessels which had been carrying naval stores to the Spanish fleet at Cadiz, and baled goods for the Royal Caracas Company being sent back to England, escorted by and . Those Spanish ships that were found to be carrying provisions were taken to Gibraltar by Rodney, and used to relieve the British forces there. In addition Rodney commissioned and manned the captured Spanish flagship, the 64-gun Guipuzcoano, naming her HMS Prince William, in honour of Prince William, who had been present at the engagement. Rodney promoted his First Lieutenant Erasmus Gower to post captain to command Prince William and sail her to Gibraltar where her foremast was removed and replaced before she was sailed to England under another captain. The four captured frigates were not added to the navy, but the two smaller vessels were purchased, being named and and rated as 14-gun brigs. British career The name Prince William was confirmed on 3 April 1780 and she was fitted and coppered at Portsmouth between April and August 1780. She was commissioned under her first commander, Captain Stair Douglas, in April that year, and joined the Channel Fleet under Sir George Darby. She sailed for the West Indies in November 1780 with the fleet under Sir Samuel Hood, and saw action with the fleet at the capture of Sint Eustatius in February 1781, and at the Battle of Fort Royal on 29/30 April 1781. Prince William then left the West Indies at the end of the year, sailing to North America and arriving there in October. She was soon back in the West Indies with Hood, and command passed from Douglas to Captain George Wilkinson. She fought with Hood's fleet at the Battle of Saint Kitts on 25/26 January 1782, where she had three men wounded. The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783 Prince William fought at the brief clash with the Comte de Grasse in the Dominica Channel on 9 April 1782, and was then at the decisive British victory at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, where she was the last ship in the van division and escaped suffering any casualties. Prince William was then part of the squadron despatched under Hood to chase down French ships, but due to her poor sailing did not arrive in time to take part in the Battle of the Mona Passage. On 14 April Wilkinson was succeeded by Captain James Vashon, who spent only two months in command before being appointed Rodney's flag captain aboard . Captain William Merrick took command later in 1782, and in July she sailed to North America with the fleet under Admiral Hugh Pigot. The fleet was at New York City between September and October, after which it sailed to blockade Cap Fran√ßois. Prince William sailed from Jamaica in April 1783, bound for Britain to be paid off on her arrival in July. After some time spent laid up, she was fitted as a sheer hulk at Portsmouth between December 1790 and April 1791, and in this state saw out most of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. She had been fitted out as a receiving ship for guns by 1811, and was broken up at Portsmouth in September 1817, two years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Notes a. Rodney successfully relieved Gibraltar, and then engaged and defeated a Spanish fleet under Juan de L√°ngara at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, on 16 January 1780. b. The two had short careers with the Royal Navy.

Seven police officers accused of his murder and assault were acquitted in the Ficksburg Regional Court in March 2013. Biography Andries was a member of the ANC until 2008 when he left the ANC to join the breakaway party COPE. In the months before he died he left COPE to join the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens (MCC), an autonomous local community organisation. He was a mathematics teacher, a community activist, journalist, community newspaper publisher and possible independent candidate for the municipal elections due to take place in May 2011. He was married to Rose Tatane. Events surrounding his death On 13 April 2011, Andries Tatane, together with 4,000 other protesters, took to the streets and marched to Setsoto Municipal Offices in Ficksburg, Free State, South Africa to protest against poor service delivery in the area. The protesters were met by police members who attempted to disperse the crowd with water cannons. While some arrested protesters were being bundled into police vans, Tatane tried to argue with the police and to block a water cannon vehicle, at which point he was grabbed around one arm by a police officer. Tatane was seen to pull his arm away from the officer who then started to beat him with a baton. Tatane appeared to move aggressively towards this officer. Four or five other police officers then pulled him away and began to kick and beat him with batons. During this time he was twice shot in the chest. Tatane collapsed shortly after and died on the scene 20 minutes later. While Tatane's death as a result of police action during a protest is by no means a unique event in South Africa, it had notably garnered greater nationwide attention than any previous such occurrence. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that the entire incident was filmed on T.V. cameras and later broadcast during the prime time evening news of the national broadcaster, the SABC. Aftermath Following Tatane's death, there has been public outrage about the manner in which he died.Several opinion pieces in South African newsmedia:  Tatane's death has been described as \\"a watershed moment in public perceptions of state violence after apartheid\\".It is time to be offended , Herman Wasserman & Sean Jacobs, The Daily Maverick, 8 May 2011 An investigation into his death was launched by the Independent Complaints Directorate's commission. The South African Police Service has also launched their own internal investigation into the matter. The death of Tatane has placed both the issue of rising anger over a lack of service delivery as well as police brutality in the media spotlight, with comparisons being drawn to the deaths of Hector Pieterson and Steve Biko at the hands of police during the height of apartheid. It has also emerged that this was not an isolated incidentAmnesty red flag police brutality, Craig Dodds, 13 May 2011Amnesty International South Africa Report 2011 and that the ICD has investigated 1,769 separate incidents of people dying in police custody or as a result of police action in 2010. National Police Commissioner Bheki Cele's statement in late August 2009 that police officers should be able to \\"shoot to kill\\" without worrying about the consequences will undoubtedly be brought to the forefront again. The ANC's National Spokesperson, Jackson Mthembu, condemned the brutality, but also chastised the SABC for broadcasting the footage during the prime time news, citing the fact that it might have upset sensitive viewers, calling on the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) to investigate the SABC's editorial decision. Mthembu has been one of the most vocal supporters of planned legislation to introduce a Media Appeals Tribunal to govern the South African media; legislation which is currently held in abeyance. After visiting the Tatane family in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, on 19 April 2011, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Dr Thabo Makgoba, directed attention to the lack of justice and delivery on promises which had preceded the incident and points out the irony of the protesters having been met with water cannons, \\"attacked with the very thing they don‚Äôt have the pleasure of in their daily lives.\\" He called on the Minister of Co- operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sicelo Shiceka, to \\"visit and see the appalling conditions under which God‚Äôs people live\\" and the Minister of Human Settlements, Tokyo Sexwale, to \\"provide houses\\".

William Basil Jones, c1875, signed by the sitter William Basil Jones (1822‚Äì1897) was a Welsh bishop and scholar who became the Bishop of St David's in 1874, holding the post until his death in 1897. Personal history Jones was born on 1 January 1822 in Cheltenham to William Tilsey Jones of Gwynfryn and his wife Jane. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, under the tutelage of Samuel Hall and Benjamin Hall Kennedy from 1834 to 1841, becoming head boy in his final year. In 1842 he matriculated to Trinity College, Oxford. He was placed in the second class in his final school of literae humaniores and in 1845 he graduated BA, receiving his MA in 1847. In 1848 Jones was elected to a Michel fellowship at Queen's College, but in 1851 he exchanged it for a fellowship at University College, Oxford, which he held until 1857. During his time as a fellow at University College he became assistant tutor and bursar, and from 1858 through to 1865 was a lecturer in modern history and the classics. He left Oxford in 1865. During his time as a lecturer Jones married his first wife, Frances Charlotte Holworthy, second daughter of Samuel Holworthy, vicar of Croxall. They were married on 10 September 1856 and remained together until Frances' death on 21 September 1881; the couple remaining childless. Jones remarried on 2 December 1896, to Anne Loxdale. Anne bore him a son and two daughters and survived her husband. While at Oxford, Jones showed himself to have a keen interest in archaeological and architectural affairs. He is credited for the design of his parish church at Llangynfelyn. From 1848 through to 1851 he was one of the general secretaries of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, and then joint editor of its journal, Archaeologia Cambrensis, in 1854. Jones was also secretary of the Oxford Architectural Society, and was part of a literary and philosophical society at Trinity known as Hermes. The society included other notable Trinity students, George Bowen, William Gifford Palgrave and Edward Augustus Freeman, all of whom were friends of Jones. Of his friendships made at Oxford, the one that endured was that with William Thomson who was also a past student at Shrewsbury School at the same time as Jones. Jones had been ordained deacon in 1848, and a priest in 1853, but after Thomson was made Bishop of Gloucester in 1861 he made Jones his examining chaplain. When Thomson was elevated to the office of Archbishop of York the next year he ensured that Jones was always close as an advisor, ensuring he held important posts in the York diocese, and in 1865 was presented with the vicarage of Bishopthorpe, where the episcopal palace is situated. Jones was soon recognised as Thomson's 'right-hand man', and a series of favourable appointments followed, with Jones becoming the Archdeacon of York in 1867, the rural dean of Bishopthorpe in 1869 and the chancellor of York in 1871. Bishop of St David's In 1874 Connop Thirlwall, the Bishop of St David's, resigned the see and Jones was appointed as his successor by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. His selection is believed to have been influenced by his scholarly work, his proven history as a clerical administrator, his past association with the Diocese of St David's and his ability, although limited, to speak Welsh. Jones in his earlier life had shown an interest in St David's Cathedral, raising a fund while at Oxford University for the restoration of the rood screen. He had also, along with his friend Edward Augustus Freeman, undertaken in writing an in-depth history of the cathedral. Jones was consecrated bishop by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald Tait, at Westminster Abbey on 14 August 1874, and was enthroned at St David's on 15 September of the same year. Jones, in his role as Bishop of St David's, continued the restoration work on existing churches but paid far more focus on the establishment of new mission churches; the number of churches consecrated by him annually was treble the figure of his predecessor. He also brought a far stricter regimen to the selection of candidates for ordination, requiring good testimonials, and preferring well educated men to those who were good orators. He also oversaw changes which saw the removal of non-resident posts, resulting in improvements in pastoral work. These improvements led to a progressive raising of the educational and spiritual standard of the ministry. After Jones' death, his successor, John Owen, wrote: 'The progress of the diocese during Bishop Jones' episcopate was far greater than the progress during any period of equal length since the Reformation', though it is recognised that much of his work built on reforms initiated by Thirlwall and before him Thomas Burgess. During his time as the Bishop of St David's, a proposed division of the diocese, then the largest in Wales, was initiated. Jones was unhappy with the suggestion, but he accepted a reduced income to the diocese on condition that the endowment left would be larger than that of the other Welsh diocese. In his role of Bishop of St David's, Jones had wide ranging powers in the constitutional development of St David's College, Lampeter. Jones took this opportunity to enact the college with a complete code of statutes (1879) instead of the few provisional rules which it previously held. He also took an active part in the government of Christ's College, Brecon, becoming chairman of its board of governors in 1880. He died at Abergwili Palace on 14 January 1897, and was buried six days later in the family vault at Llangynfelyn.

It is the 54th Oswald short by Lantz and the 107th in the entire series. Plot The cartoon begins inside a house. In there, Oswald and his girlfriend Kitty are playing a piano together. On their instrument are a dancing candle stand and two mice playing the accordion. At a laboratory only a few miles away, a mad scientist completes construction of a robot and activates it. To his surprise, the robot begins to swing punches at him. The mad scientist, however, is able to evade the attacks and stops the humanoid machine with a punch of his own. He soon learns that his creation needs one more thing: a heart. Back in Oswald's place, the two friends decide to play hide-and-seek. Oswald is \\"it\\" and Kitty is the one to hide. While the rabbit counts, his playmate looks for a hiding place. Without warning, Kitty gets captured through an opened window by the mad scientist who then leaves a sack inside before fleeing. Convinced that she is hiding in the bag, Oswald approaches and opens it. To his amusement, what comes out is a marching flute player. As the rabbit goes to find his friend, he notices a strand of thread on the window sill which he follows. The thread is in fact the trousers of the mad scientist who later appears in spotted shorts. At the laboratory, the mad scientist has Kitty wedged in a vise and attempts to perform surgery on her, i.e. take out her heart and place it in the robot. But before he could start, the nefarious inventor sees through his surveillance device that someone came to his facility. Oswald reaches just outside the laboratory after following the whole thread. Upon knocking on the door, a trap activates, causing him to fall into a chute, leading towards the basement. In an attempt to slaughter Oswald, the mad scientist waits for the little rabbit's arrival at other end of the shoot, preparing to swing an axe. The mad scientist swings but misses. From there, the chase begins. Oswald runs through several corridors of the laboratory. While approaching an intersection, he sees something white popping in and out of the left corner. For his defence, Oswald picks up a nearby urn. There was indeed a skeleton innocently sitting on a rocking chair by the left corner, but the mad scientist, who was coming from the corridor in that direction, pulls it away, and walks into the intersection. Upon seeing what entered his hallway, Oswald tosses the urn. The mad scientist is struck right in the head and is knocked cold. Oswald finds a rope and ties one end of it around his pursuer's leg, with the other end around a lion's tail. The lion runs in place, hanging the mad scientist above the floor. Oswald, at last, finds the chamber where Kitty was held. He loosens the vise and frees her. Later, a goat comes along and pulls a mechanical part out of his mouth and drops it. Oswald and Kitty both laugh about it. Copyright status The copyright for Mechanical Man expired in 1960. Therefore, it is in the public domain. A number of Oswald shorts and other cartoons produced by Walter Lantz Production also ended up in similar status. Differences in the VHS version Walter Lantz and Universal released the cartoon on a VHS video tape on public known as the Guild/Firelight reissue print (VHS; Video Yesteryear), which had better quality and better audio, but still had the re-used title. However, many scenes were cut, like the scene where Pete says \\"This thing needs a human heart, I'll get one\\"; the scene where Pete tells a skunk to \\"get busy\\"; and the final scene cut shows Pete taking the heart out of Kitty's mouth, however the heart later gets back in. Even though it was released on VHS, it was never released on DVD at all, or its first re-used version print or even the original version of the print at all. Adaptations Other animators created their own versions of this story. The characters that starred in those versions include Mickey Mouse, Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid, Scrappy, and Flip the Frog.

Location of the Central African Republic Wildlife in the Central African Republic is in the vast natural habitat located between the Congo Basin's rain forests and large savannas, where the human density was smaller than 0.5 per km2 prior to 1850. The forest area of 22.755 million, considered one of the richest storehouses of wildlife spread over national parks, hunting reserves and community hunting areas, experienced an alarming loss of wild life due to greed for ivory and bushmeat exploitation by hunters ‚Äì mostly Arab slavers from across the borders of the Central African Republic (Central African Republic) with Chad and Sudan. Realising the serious threat to the wildlife, the colonists ‚Äì French Administration ‚Äì in 1935 and later the Government of the Republic of CRA, enacted laws and created National parks and preserves, which covered 16.6% of the country. The three most coveted national parks are the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park with its reported \\"greatest concentrations of hippos in the world\\", the Bamingui-Bangoran National Park in the north; and the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve which covers rain forests. The Manovo-Gounda-Saint-Floris National Park, in particular was inscribed to the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in 1988 in recognition of the diversity of life present within it in respect of its wealth of flora and fauna. In 2014, the Chinko Nature Reserve in eastern CRA was granted management through a public-private partnership with the Central African Republic Ministry of Wildlife, Water and Forestry and African Parks, a conservation NGO that takes on the direct, long-term management of national parks and protected areas in partnership with governments to save wildlife, restore landscapes and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local communities. African Parks has a mandate to manage this protected area, now referred to as the Chinko Project, for the next 50 years. However, the legal instruments were not effective in controlling poaching activities for profits, as institutional support for protected areas has all along been weak with hunters and loggers not letting go their activities even in national parks. Most of the timber extracted from the CRA is exported to Europe. Situated in the east of the CRA, Chinko is one of the region's only remaining strongholds for numerous species including the highly threatened Lord Derby eland, bongo, and chimpanzees. This important ecosystem, however, is under tremendous pressure from militarized ivory poachers and intense levels of cattle grazing. The richness of the wild life of the Central African Republic is reflected in its about 3,600 species of plants, 663 birds, 209 mammals (includes two endemic species and 11 threatened species), 187 reptiles and 29 amphibians. Geography Dzanga- Sangha Reserve in the CRA The Central African Republic, a landlocked country in Africa, which was once a French colony under the name Ubangi-Shari, is a rich rainforest area of 22.755 million ha with tropical forest covering 35% of the area of the country. The rich forests of the Central African Republic vary and are largely delimited within the major tropical rain forests of Africa and the great open savannas that stretches from across the continent, south of the Sahara. Depending on the climatic conditions, it is distributed with thick forests in the south, woody savanna in the centre and grasslands in the north. The wild life in these forests reflects all the species identified in Africa; the most conspicuous species are the elephants, chimpanzees, crocodiles, hippos, giraffes and many more. The ecosystem in Central African Republic comprises the Western Congo Basin Forests, the Northeastern Congo Basin Forests, and the Sudanian Savannas. The land use is categorised under the grass and shrub as 59%, under crops and settlements at 5% and major forests at 36% of the total land area of the country. Anthropological pressure is reported to be low in 46% area; medium in 44% and high in 10% of the land area. Apart from all the savanna species of wild animals, the unique species found here is of forest gorillas. It had recorded the least percentage of forest loss in the period between 1990 and 2005 of 1.9%. Subsequently, logging roads were built not only to sustain subsistence agriculture but mostly for poaching for bush meat and ivory hunting, which has caused severe depletion of the abundant and diverse wildlife of CRA. =Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park= Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park is a national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Central African Republic. It was inscribed to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1988 covering an area of 1.74 million ha under category (ix)(x), recognising the diversity of life present within it, and under IUCN Category II. It encompasses three zones namely, \\"the flood plain of the Bahr Aouk and Bahr Kameur rivers in the north, the Massif des Bongo in the south, and a gently undulating transitional plain between.\\" The vegetation types that dominate the park within these three zones consists of Sudanese-Guinean woodland savannah that is further subdivided under five types namely, \\"the Terminalia laxiflora wooded savannah; the Isoberlinia doka and Monotes kerstingii woodland; the Pseudocedrela kotschyi and Terminalia macroptera woodland; the mixed lowland woodland or wooded savannah; and Anogeissus leio and Khaya senegalensis.\\" However, due to poaching activity within the park and severe loss of flora and wild life, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, in 1997. Some 59 species have been recorded within the park. =Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve= Forest elephants in the wetlands of saline Dzanga-Sangha. Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve is a protected reserve of southwestern Central African Republic was established in 1990 and covers . The forest special reserve was established in 1990 along with its neighbouring Dzanga Ndoki National Park. Until 1986, anybody was free to shoot game in the forest. The reserve is ecologically rich and contains a variety of megafauna such as western lowland gorillas, African forest elephants, bongo antelopes, African forest buffalos, In 1999, the forest special reserve was administered collaboratively by the Central African Ministry of Environment, Water, Forests, Hunting and Fishing, and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). = Chinko Project = Situated in east CRA, the Chinko Project provides a rare sanctuary for wildlife in a volatile region plagued by militarised ivory poachers and excessive cattle farming. Extreme poverty has resulted in a 95% depletion of all wildlife, making this one of the most crucial conservation projects on the continent. There are very few places on earth quite like Chinko. This landscape, comprising both tropical rainforest and savannah plains, is home to ten species of primate, two distinct types of elephant and the iconic Lord Derby eland. Legal ordinances To preserve the unique forest vegetation that covers 35% of the land area of the country and the wild life within it, and put an end to the intensive poaching activity from across its international border with Chad and Sudan, establishment of National parks and reserves to preserve the environment of rich natural heritage became a necessity. The French Administration as colonists of the country in 1935 and later the Government of the Central African Republic enacted laws to establish National Parks, Presidential Parks, Strict Nature Reserves, Wildlife Reserves, Special Reserves and Biosphere Reserves. The National Parks set up are the Andre Felix National Park, the Bamingui-Bangoran National Park, the Manovo- Gounda Saint Floris and the Zdanga-Ndoki; the Presidential Park is the D'Avakaba; the Strict Nature Reserves are the Mba√©r√©-Bodingu√© Reserve and the Vassaka-Bolo Reserve; the Wildlife Reserves are Aouk-Aoukale Reserve, Gribingui-Bamingui Reserve, Koukourou-Bamingui Reserve, Nana-Barya Reserve, Ouandja-Vakaga Reserve, the Yata-Ngaya Reserve and the Zemongo Reserve; the Special Reserve is the Dzanga-Sangha; and the Biosphere Reserve is Basse- Lobaye. Important ordinances enacted by the Central African Republic concern protection of wild life and regulation of hunting, under the guideline that wild life forms an integral part of the national heritage. The law defines various categories of protected areas and prescribed rules for their establishment, apart from the management aspects of fully and partially protected species and ordinary game species; regulation hunting procedures have also been listed for ordinary game species. Taking of fully protected species is banned. Partially protected species can be taken with specific permission. The capturing and transport of wild animals by and under the control of the Wildlife Department, enforcement measures and penalties are also defined. Flora The flora of the Central African Republic has not been very well studied at all, although at least 3600 species are known. However, there are likely to be as many as 5000 species. The country is mainly dominated by Sudanian woodland, although a small area of Acacia dominates the Sahelian woodland in the extreme north. Many of the species which are endemic to the country are located in the hills of northeast, especially in the Massif des Bongos and Massif du Dar Chala in the Yata Ngaya Faunal Reserve area. Notable northern forests include Kotto, Kaga-Bandoro and Nana forest. Savanna reserves in the north important for large manmals people , especially Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Biosphere Reserve and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and the north of the country also contains floodplains. In the southwest is lowland forest and secondary grassland interspersed with forest in the Bangassou area of the south. Lowland forest exists in the southwest in the Dzangha-Sangha and Mbaere Bodingue Ngoto areas. Shrubs and bush vegetation mostly confined in the extreme northern region. Tropical forests cover 3.5 million ha. The tropical forests contain luxuriant plant growth with hundreds of plant species including Entradrolphragus angolensis, Lophira alata, Manilkara mabokeensis, Monodora myristica, Ricinodendron heudlotii, along with the African tulip tree, rubber tree, strangler fig, and cecropia. Woodland savannah mainly consists of Vitellaria paradoxa, Combretum spp., Acacia spp., Anogeissus leiocarpa, Afzelia africana, Burkea africana, Isoberlinia doka, Terminalia spp., Khaya senegalensis, Rafia sudanica and Borassus spp. along the rivers. Fauna Chimpanzees in the Central African Republic. The fauna of the CRA consists of 209 mammal species, of which two are endemic and 11 are threatened. The threatened species listed in the 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals are: endangered species namely, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), giant African water shrew (Potamogale velox), red colobus (Procolobus badius) and wild dog (Lycaon pictus); and the vulnerable species are African elephant (Loxodonta africana), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), Gounda mouse (Mus goundae); endemic species are Hun shrew (Crocidura attila), lion (Panthera leo), and Oubangui mouse (Mus oubanguii), red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons) and spotted-necked otter (Lutra maculicollis]). The Gabon dwarf shrew (Suncus remyi), which was critically endangered in the past is now a species of least concern. The wildlife of CRA featured on a sheet of the Boy Scouts' Association 1997 contains lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus), red kite, great white pelican, cattle egret, wild dog, gnu, panther, African elephant, buffalo, hippopotamus and leopards, though no stamps of the wildlife have been issued. Almost every animal of the tropics is found here, including the elephant; its ivory was once a major source of wealth but has declined in economic importance. The southwest has a colourful variety of butterflies. The faunal species are listed in the Animal Diversity Web site of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, some of which are mentioned in the following sections. Both crocodiles and hippopotamuses are found in the rivers. =Mammals= Mammals are African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), chimpanzees, forest buffalo or dwarf buffalo, forest antelopes (bongo), moustached monkey, (Cercopithecus cephus), Hyperolius viridiflavus, blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), black-cheeked white-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius), guereza (Colobus guereza), oribi (Ourebia ourebi), Angolan colobus (Colobus angolensis), Pennant's red colobus (Piliocolobus pennantii), puku (Kobus vardonii), western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), white buffalo (Syncerus caffer), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), giant Lord's Derby eland (Taurotragus derbianus). Western lowland gorillas are tracked in the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the south of the Central African Republic, apart from witnessing elephants in groups of 30‚Äì100 bathing in mud pools and feeding. Forest elephants, heavily poached in the past, found only in the rain forests, are comparatively smaller in size in relation with the elephants found in the savanna habitat; even their ivory are stated to be harder, stronger with a different shade called the \\"pink or hot ivory\\". Likewise, forest buffaloes found here, also called the dwarf buffaloes, are shorter in size compared to those found in the savanna. Black rhino (Diceros bicornis) is now reported to be an extinct species in the CRA dropping \\"from 3000 to 0\\". Due to poaching and diseases caused due to introduction of illegal cattle transhumance, elephant (Loxodonta africana) and buffon kob (Kobus kob) populations declined by over 80% each, over a period of 20 years. An African elephant in a musth state. Breeding of elephants in the dry months of December to March and July‚ÄìAugust has some interesting aspects. Males are said to be in rut or musth when it is noted that secretions appear near their head as dark stains combined with continuous dribbling of urine. During this musth time they roam in the forest in search of females in estrous state, based on smell and the ‚Äúestrous song‚Äù, which the females belt out, which are heard over several miles in the forest. Hunting of elephants is totally prohibited. As of 1990, the country had about 1500 giraffe and 8000 buffalo in the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and 6800 in Bamingui-Bangoran National Park. There are 19 or 20 species of primates in Central African Republic. Of particular note is the gorillas, protected in the Dzanga-Sangha reserve and chimpanzees which are protected in the Zemongo Faunal Reserve and are also found south of Bambio and east of Bayanga. The country has 23 species of antelopes and one of Africa's largest populations of giant eland in the north and east of the country. Significant numbers of duiker, sitatunga and bongo are found in the southwest, particularly at Bangassou. The unusual features of the forest antelopes found in the CRA is that they all have spiral horns and striped pelages. The country has ten recorded species of bats, of which one is endemic, Epomophorus gambianus poussarguesi. ;Carnivores Carnivores reported are: spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), Sudan cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus) and Chadian wild dogs (Lycaon pictus sharicus). ;Rodents Rodents include Zenkerella insignis, Prionomys batesi, Hylomyscus fumosus and two endemic species of mouse; Mus goundae in the north and Mus oubanguii from the south. Also found are giant otter shrew (Potamogale velox), Gambian rat (Cricetomys gambianus), Pousargues's mongoose, (Dologale dybowskii), checkered elephant-shrew (Rhynchocyon cirnei), Delany's swamp mice (Delanymyinae), and Allen's squirrel galago, Galago alleni. =Reptiles= Reptiles of the Central African Republic as listed in the laws of the land are: Geochelone sulcata, giant tortoise, Varanus, python, and crocodile. =Birds= Avifauna of the CRA forests includes lesser woolly bat (Kerivoula lanosa), Veldkamp's bat (Nanonycteris veldkampii), grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), agile mangabey (Cercocebus agilis), grey-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus), shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus), Dzanga robin (Stiphrornis sanghensis), Hartlaub's duck (Pteronetta hartlaubii), ostrich (struthio camelus), little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), pelican, cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), shoebill (balaeniceps rex), hamerkop (scopus umbretta), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), yellow-billed stork (Mycteria ibis) and raptors and water birds. In the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park alone 379 species of birds have been sighted, which can be seen from observation platforms built in the park or by taking a boat ride on the Sangha River or its tributary, the Mossapoula River. =Insects= ;Lepidoptera Conservation There was a time when Central African Republic was given the epithet \\"an animal paradise\\". However, over the centuries, this situation changed even though several parks and reserves were created. As a result of uncontrolled poaching, the number of elephants dropped from 100,000 to less than 10,000 and the rhinoceros almost disappeared. To conserve the rich wild life resources of the Central African Republic has therefore been a major issue of concern, in spite of establishing, with legal ordinances, national Parks, game reserves and so forth. The main reasons for this has been the vastness and impoverished status of the country as a whole. However, the effectiveness of wildlife crime law enforcement appears to be working now with the Central African Ministry of Water and Forests and the Central Police, with technical support from international environmental organizations such as WWF playing an effective role, to punish high-level traffickers with penal servitude and fines; a case cited is of a trafficker sentenced to a jail term of 6 months and a fine. In the conservation efforts, WWF has persuaded the Baka, indigenous hunter-gatherers known as pygmies of Central African Republic to work for the conservation of the wild life in their homeland on which they subsisted. In a wild life reserve exclusively devoted to preserve the rights of the pygmies as also to prevent deforestation, bushmeat hunting and human migration, the Baka community has extended full cooperation and effective participation. By honouring the traditional rights of the community to fish, hunt and gather food, and also providing them alternate employment as trackers and park rangers with health care, and with income generated from ecotourism, there is an encouraging sign of elephant poaching figures showing drastic downward trend. The forest department of Central African Republic has introduced new forest codes in 2008 to ensure better management of the forest resources on a sustainable basis to regulate and preserve the biodiversity by balancing the growth and employment requirements with due attention to check desertification. Under the new laws, border control inspectors with mobile squads to check the movement of lumber crossing the nation's borders, to enhance revenues from forestry with due cognisance of the forestry and wild life sources of the country have been introduced. A financial mechanism has also been introduced at a communal level for local management of funds.

Biography Elizabeth Miller was born September 20, 1822 in Peterboro, New York. She was the daughter of antislavery philanthropist Gerrit Smith and his spouse, the abolitionist Ann Carroll Fitzhugh. In 1843, Elizabeth married Charles Dudley Miller.Gerrit Smith Estate, National Historic Landmark Nomination, NPS Form 10-900 USDI/NPS NRHP Registriation Form (Rev. 8-86) OMB No. 1024-0018. Elizabeth and Charles Dudley Miller occupied the \\"Cottage Across the Brook\\", on her father's estate at Peterboro, New York. It was later the home of their son, Gerrit Smith Miller. The family later moved to Geneva, New York,U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Elizabeth Smith Miller (April 15, 2011). where Miller died on May 23, 1911. National Women's Right Convention At the third National Women's Rights Convention gavelled in Syracuse, Smith Miller was the author of a motion to create State-based women's rights organizations when the motion to create a national organization failed. She was with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in the founding of the National Woman Suffrage Association. Literary activity Following her father's death in 1874, Elizabeth Smith Miller worked on a biography of his life along with author Octavius Brooks Frothingham. When Frothingham went so far as to allege that Smith had prior knowledge of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, Elizabeth ordered the publisher to recall the tomes, break their bindings, and remove the information. In her later years, Smith Miller penned a home economics treatise. Dress code reform An advocate of Victorian dress reform, Elizabeth Smith Miller first wore the Turkish pantaloons and knee length skirt later popularized by Amelia Bloomer in The Lily. The apparel and its undergarment was similar to utilitarian outfits also worn by women of the utopian Oneida Community and the Oneida Nation's women. Dress reform was seen as essential in liberating women from the functional constraints imposed on their activities by conventions reinforcing a male dominated society. \\"Bloomers\\" were worn by leaders of the women's rights movement as an act of rebellion until the amount of attention the protest received in the popular press became a distraction from the movement.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Carlow unless stated otherwise.

Al-Qurmezi became famous in Bahrain and internationally after reading out a poem criticising Bahraini government policies to the Pearl Roundabout gathering of pro-democracy protesters. After the poem was widely circulated via social media she and her family were subjected to harassment and death threats. She was arrested and detained in conditions of secrecy, and rumours of her death in custody led to protests by Iranian activists. She was subjected to torture while in custody but was eventually tried on charges of inciting hatred of the Bahraini regime and insulting members of the royal family. International human rights organisations described her detention and trial as illustrating the brutality of the Bahraini authorities. She was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which she was allowed to serve under house arrest. Involvement in the Bahraini uprising (2011‚Äìpresent) =Public reading of poems= On Wednesday, February 23, 2011, during the early days of the Bahraini uprising (2011‚Äìpresent), Ayat Al-Qurmezi delivered a poem from the podium to the gathering of pro-democracy demonstrators at the Pearl Roundabout, that was critical of government policies and specifically those of Khalifa ibn Salman Al Khalifa, the prime minister of Bahrain. On March 6, 2011, she read out another poem to the crowd at Pearl Roundabout which criticized King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. One verse included the lines: \\"We are the people who will kill humiliation and assassinate misery. Don't you hear their cries? Don't you hear their screams?\\" Another verse imagined a dialogue between the Devil and the King in which the Devil, Hamad's \\"best and most courageous pupil\\", says: ‚ÄúHamad, your people have shaken me. Don't you hear their cries?‚Äù\\"A Poetry of resistance: The Disappearance of Ayat Al-Qormezi in Bahrain's Hidden Story\\", Al-Jaddliyaa, June 14, 2011, accessed July 14, 2011 The student quickly rose to fame through the media channels of YouTube, Twitter and through BlackBerry Messenger as her poem was spread throughout Bahrain and the rest of the world. Since then, Ayat has been exposed to several forms of harassment and death threats that included herself and her family. Her personal information has been published through emails and Blackberry messages. She has reportedly received numerous phone calls threatening her life and safety. =Arrest= On the morning of March 29, 2011, riot police accompanied by female police officers with orders to detain Ayat Al-Qurmezi forced their way into the family home. Not finding her there, the police proceeded to ransack the house, reportedly telling her mother that they intended to arrest Ayat ‚Äúeven if she is hidden in the depths of the earth‚Äù. The next day Ayat Al-Qurmezi was arrested after police raided her parents' house a second time and forced four of Ayat's brothers at gunpoint to lie on the floor. After one police officer shouted at their father \\"If you do not tell us where Ayat is in fifteen minutes, we will kill each of your sons in front of your eyes ‚Äì I have orders to do so\\". Ayat's parents felt they had no choice but to ask her to return home. When she returned she was taken away in a car with two plain-clothes security officials, a man and a woman, both wearing masks. She subsequently reported how they began immediately to beat her, threatening that she would be raped and sexually assaulted and that degrading photographs of her would be posted on the internet. The family described the days that followed as a period of intense psychological torture. The riot troops and police (whose identities had been concealed) who took Ayat away had told Ayat's mother Sa'ada that after she had been interrogated and signed some documents, the family would be allowed to collect her from Al-Howra police station and take her home. They heard nothing more. Sa'ada went from police station to police station trying to obtain information about her daughter until she was eventually advised to file a missing persons report. She complained about the absurdity of this advice when it was the police themselves who had taken Ayat away. Pictures of Ayat began to turn up on dating and pornographic websites. The family heard rumours that she had been raped or been killed. Eventually Sa'ada was allowed to speak to Ayat on the telephone. Ayat told her that she had been forced to sign a false confession. Sa'ada was told in confidence that Ayat was in a military hospital being treated for injuries inflicted while she was tortured. Ayat told her mother that she had been interrogated several times at the interrogation centre where she was taken after her arrest. A video was broadcast on Bahraini state television of Ayat giving her name and saying that she was a Shia and hated Sunnis. Ayat was expelled from university, apparently as part of a government purge of students and university employees accused of supporting the protests. Local and International responses for arrest *Al-Wefaq, the main opposition political group whose 18 parliamentary representatives resigned in protest against the harsh measures taken against the pro-democracy protesters, described Ayat Al-Qurmezi's arrest as a \\"clear message that the government is against freedom of expression.\\" *Amnesty International condemned the brutal behaviour of the Bahraini authorities and called for Ayat's release. Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Director for the Middle East and North Africa observed that: He noted that Ayat al-Qarmezi had been put on trial merely for expressing her opinion, peacefully and openly, and describing her case as an appalling and sinister attack on free speech, he called for the charges against her to be dropped and for her to be released immediately. *English PEN, reminding the Bahraini authorities of their obligations to protect the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Bahrain is an official state party, called for Ayat's immediate and unconditional release.Poet and writer arrested; fears for their safety\\", English PEN, accessed July 14, 2011 *Supporters circulated petitions and called for the release of the \\"Freedom Poet\\" through blogs and social media. *The United Nations called for \\"an immediate cessation of trials of civilians in the court of national safety and an immediate release of peaceful demonstrators who were arrested in the context of the protest movement in February.\\" Following reports of Ayat Al- Qurmezi's rape and death in custody, there were protests by women in Iran and one of the vessels in a flotilla bringing Iranian activists to Bahrain to support the protesters was named after her. The Ayat Al-Qurmezi was intercepted and turned back by the Bahraini navy. The Bahraini authorities defended the decision to detain and prosecute Ayat Al-Qurmezi on the grounds that her poem had called for \\"uprising and hatred against the leadership\\" and in Bahrain that was illegal. =Torture= Following her arrest Ayat Al- Qurmezi was detained for nine days in a tiny and extremely cold cell. She believed that from time to time a gas of some kind was circulated through the cell's air conditioning system which made her feel that she was suffocating. She was struck around the face with electric cable and made to clean lavatories with her bare hands. Some reports indicated that she was also threatened with rape. Throughout this time the police made no attempt to carry out any genuine interrogation. On June 21, 2011, she made a televised apology to the king and the prime minister. According to Ayat Al-Qurmezi's brother, Yousif Mohammed, her treatment in prison improved during the period before the trial. =Trial= Ayat Al-Qurmezi was charged with \\"incitement to hatred of the regime\\", \\"insulting members of the royal family\\" and \\"illegal assembly\\". After spending two months in custody she was tried by a security court at which no legal arguments were heard and her lawyer was not allowed to address the court. On June 12, 2011, Al-Qurmezi was found guilty and sentenced to one year's imprisonment. The court's ruling was denounced by opposition groups and Amnesty International, who said the verdict highlighted how free speech is \\"brutally denied\\" by Bahrain's authorities. =Release= On July 13, 2011, Al-Qurmezi was released from prison. A crowd of hundreds greeted her on her return home to Sanad.\\"We congratulate the family of Ayat Al-Qurmezi on her release\\", Nabeel Rajab, July 13, 2011, accessed July 13, 2011\\"People welcome for Ayat shows that repression can create heroes\\", Nabeel Rajab, July 13, 2011, accessed July 14, 2011 However, as of October 2011 her sentence had not been revoked, and she remained under house arrest. \\"Attorney General: Release Ayat Al-Qurmezi with guarantee her location\\" Bahrain News Agency, July 13, 2011, accessed July 14, 2011\\"Bahrain puts protest poet under house arrest\\", Reuters, July 14, 2011, accessed July 15, 2011 Her family feared she may be recalled to prison at any time.

It was triggered by incumbent MP Devan Nair stepping down in order to become President of Singapore (succeeding Benjamin Sheares, who had died on 12 May 1981). The by-election was won by the leader of the Workers' Party, J.B. Jeyaretnam, defeating the candidate of the governing People's Action Party (PAP), Pang Kim Hin. The by-election marked the first occasion since Singapore's independence in which a PAP candidate was defeated in an election for a seat in Parliament.Singapore Party Loses Vote, New York Times, 1 November 1981.I'll start work right away says Jeya , New Nation, 2 November 1981.  Candidates  The Nomination Day for the by-election was 21 October 1981. The election deposit for candidates was set at $1500. Three candidates stood in the by-election: Pang Kim Hin of the PAP, J.B. Jeyaretnam of the Worker's Party and Harbans Singh of the United People's Front (UPF). The leader of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), Chiam See Tong, also considered standing in the by-election, but decided to withdraw at the last minute and leave Jeyaretnam to be the PAP's main opponent in the name of \\"opposition unity\\".  Result  Note: As Habans Singh of United People's Front failed to garner the minimum 12.5% (one-eighth) of the votes necessary to keep his deposit, his election deposit was forfeited.  Reasons for the PAP's defeat  A number of factors are thought to have contributed to ruling party's defeat in this by-election. One of them was the fact that Pang was a new face to the public in Singapore whereas Jeyaretnam was a veteran of several general elections and by-elections (though this was the first time he had stood in Anson). Another factor may have been that Pang did not make use of Anson's grassroots leaders during his campaign, upsetting some of them, and that he did not connect effectively with working-class people in the constituency. Another issue surrounding the campaign was that residents in the Blair Plain area of the constituency were unhappy that they were not being given priority for HDB flats when their homes were being demolished to make way for a new Port of Singapore Authority container complex, and some voters may have used the by-election as an opportunity to express discontent regarding this.Anson by-election , Singapore - The Encyclopedia (retrieved 6 February 2012). Historical significance This is one of the most significant elections in Singapore's political history because it was the first opposition victory since the Barisan Sosialis had left Parliament in 1966. It was the third by-election to have been held in Anson. The election marked the Workers' Party's return to Parliament after 18 years. The last time they won an election was back in 1961, when David Marshall also won a by- election in Anson as a candidate for the party (however he lost the seat in the 1963 general election). = Aftermath of the by-election = Jeyaretnam successfully retained the seat with a larger majority of 2,376 votes in the 1984 general election, when he defeated the PAP's Ng Pock Too. He captured 56.8% of the votes in the constituency in that election. Another opposition politician was also elected to Parliament at the 1984 general election - Chiam See Tong of the SDP, who was elected as the MP for Potong Pasir. Chiam would go on to represent the seat for a further six terms until 2011 and become Singapore's second longest-serving opposition MP. However, Jeyaretnam was convicted for allegedly misreporting his party accounts and was forced to vacate the Anson seat in 1986. The constituency was abolished in 1988 and split between the Tanjong Pagar and Kreta Ayer constituency, with a significant of the portion also forming the Tiong Bahru Group Representation Constituency in 1988 election. Tiong Bahru was then absorbed into the Tanjong Pagar Group Representation constituency at the 1991 general election. As of the 2020 elections, Anson was based on Radin Mas SMC, while WP had won 10 seats in parliament including its stronghold of Hougang SMC as well as Aljunied GRC and Sengkang GRC, for the former it became the longest-held opposition ward since 1991. Harbans Singh became the first candidate in Singapore election history to have forfeited his election deposit twice, with the first occurring on the 1976 elections contesting under Tanjong Pagar with 11.0% of the valid votes. Until the 2013 by-election, WP's Lee Li Lian repeated the end outcome as she won a seat from the incumbent PAP of Punggol East SMC (now as a division under Sengkang GRC), while Singapore Democratic Alliance candidate Desmond Lim repeated the feat on losing his deposit twice after he lost his deposit first during the 2011 election that held prior. Although the PAP has remained the dominant party in Singapore politics due to a supermajority, it has never again held a complete monopoly of all the seats in Parliament since the 1981 by-election.

He was subsequently named Assistant Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Military District, then Quartermaster General of the Warsaw Military District, and then Chief of Staff of the Odessa Military District. In 1898, Sakharov became Chief of the General Staff of the Imperial Russian Army. In early 1904, after the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Sakharov succeeded Aleksey Kuropatkin as a Minister of War, when Kuropatkin was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces in Manchuria. Sakharov remained in St Petersburg throughout the war, and had little influence on the strategy or tactics of the conflict. He was dismissed from this post by Tsar Nicholas II on 21 June 1905 and replaced by Lieutenant General Aleksandr Rediger on 4 July 1905.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 339. In late 1905, Sakharov was sent to Saratov Province to restore order during agrarian disturbances. On 22 November 1905, he was mortally shot by the SR woman terrorist Anastasia Bitsenko in the house of the Saratov governor Pyotr Stolypin.

His professional career began in 2005 with a role in the comedy television series Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby as Willem Van der Muren. His work includes the lead character Axl Johnson, in the comedy-drama, The Almighty Johnsons, with his most recent on-camera roles as real-life figures Sam Giancana in US series The Making of the Mob: Chicago, and Victor Lownes in American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story.

During high school, Emmett performed in his first public theatre productions, firstly with New Zealand's National Sheila Winn Shakespeare competition, then became involved in youth improvisation troupe, Joe Improv, which performed live shows four times a year at Wellington's Capital E. It was at one of these shows that New Zealand director Danny Mulheron saw Emmett perform and asked him to audition for the role of Willem in Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby. Emmett performed in various New Zealand television and film productions during his time at high school, including Passion in Paradise, The Hot House, The Investigator and Time Trackers. Emmett completed high school at the end of 2005 and the following year he toured New Zealand and Sydney, performing various re-written works of Shakespeare with the acting company The Ugly Shakespeare Company, before being accepted into Wellington tertiary institute Toi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School, in 2007.

It was established on March 17, 1996, following the merger of the FDNY and New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation's emergency medical services division. FDNY EMS provides coverage of all five boroughs of New York City with ambulances and a variety of specialized response vehicles. History Prior to March 17, 1996, municipal ambulances were operated by NYC EMS under the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, a public benefit corporation, which dispatched both its own ambulances and hospital ambulances. On March 17, 1996, NYC EMS merged with the FDNY, forming the Bureau of EMS. Employees of the newly formed bureau were considered FDNY employees and became eligible for transfer to firefighter within the department. As a result of the merger, the FDNY Bureau of EMS became the largest fire department-based EMS system in the United States. Operations FDNY EMS is lead by the Chief of the Bureau of EMS Lillian Bonsignore. It is broken down into eight divisions. Each division is led by a division chief, up to 5 deputy chiefs, and a division captain. Each division is then broken down further into stations which are led by captains and lieutenants. FDNY EMS controls the operation of all ambulances in the New York City 911 System. 70% of the ambulances in the 911 system are FDNY EMS municipal units while the remaining 30% of 911 system coverage is provided by hospital-based units known as Voluntary Hospital Ambulances, which are staffed by paid hospital personnel who work in partnership with FDNY EMS. Private ambulance services and Volunteer Ambulance Corps also make their resources available to supplement the 911 system. FDNY EMS maintains and controls Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD), and telemetry (online medical control). FDNY EMS is also responsible for managing emergency medical care for all mass casualty incidents (MCI's) in New York City. Units FDNY Haz-Tac AmbulanceThe FDNY EMS uses a variety of units: * Regular ambulances may be staffed to BLS or ALS levels. * Haz-tac ambulances, also known as Hazardous Material Tactical Units, are ambulances trained to the hazardous materials technician level allowing them to provide emergency medical care and decontamination in a hazardous environment. There are 39 haz-tac ambulance units. * Rescue medics are ALS ambulances trained to the level of hazmat technician in addition to rescue technician training and water training. There are 11 units. * EMS conditions cars are vehicles assigned to EMS lieutenants or captains, the supervisors overseeing the activities of the ambulance crews in their jurisdiction. There is generally one assigned per station. * EMS major emergency response vehicles (MERV) are vehicles that are able to treat multiple casualties at the same time, with ALS and BLS functions. The unit seats 14 and has a stretcher, and is assigned to all major medical emergencies within its borough. There is one MERV assigned to Divisions 1, 2 and 5 each. Brooklyn no longer has a MERV, while Queens's MERV was lost to a vehicle fire. * EMS medical evacuation transportation units (METU) are medical transports able to transport 24 non-ambulatory patients, 32 seated patients, or 10 wheel chair bound patients in the walkway for transport to area hospitals. There is one METU assigned to Divisions 3, 4 and 5 each. All three were purchased with Department of Homeland Security funds. * EMS mobile respiratory treatment units (MRTU) are similar to METUs, and are also able to treat patients for smoke inhalation and other respiratory issues with oxygen, albuterol, and combivent. One MRTU is located in Divisions 1, 2, 3 each. All three were purchased with Department of Homeland Security funds. * EMS logistical support units (LSU) carry medical supplies for use in mass-casualty incidents, as well as two generators, lights, a command tent and an inflatable tent. *Haz tac officers are rescue paramedics that respond alongside haz tac and rescue ambulances as the medical component of the FDNY Special Operations Command. Two of these units can also can function as EMS condition officers when needed. * EMS response physicians are emergency physicians with specialized training in hazardous materials, technical rescue, and other specialized prehospital skills such as on-scene limb amputations. The response physician responds to major mass-casualty incidents or as part of the Rescue Medical Task Force for patients requiring technical rescue or prolonged extrication. The vehicle is also known as the Five Mary Car due to the radio designation Car 5M. Apparatus =Livery= Older FDNY Ambulance 492 New FDNY Ford F-450 Ambulances Immediately after the takeover of NYC EMS the FDNY changed the livery of the existing ambulances by changing the color of the striping on the vehicles to blue and red. The initials FDNY were placed on the vehicle with two letters on both sides of an existing Star of Life, with the word ambulance underneath. The driver's side and passenger side doors were also adorned with the new command patch. Subsequent vehicles were ordered in the traditional FDNY livery of white over red with a set of three stripes (yellow, white, yellow) running down the side. All other markings were kept in place. =Vehicles= The FDNY Bureau of EMS utilizes Type I Ambulances, which are based on the chassis-cabs of super duty pickup-trucks. This type was chosen over the Type II ambulance that are based on a passenger/cargo van chassis and the Type III which are based on chassis-cabs of light duty vans due to the ability to fully customize the passenger compartment. Type I ambulances also offer a higher load-capacity and additional compartment space when compared to the two other types. These ambulances are also more resilient to the stresses placed on them in a high volume EMS system in an inner city environment. In 2011, the FDNY began ordering ambulances from Wheeled Coach which are based on a Dodge Ram 4500 Crew Cab Chassis. The shift to a four-door ambulance was due to the tremendous call volume and harsh 24/7 cycle that the FDNY operates in. Furthermore, the additional cab space provided for crew comfort, additional storage, and the opportunity to have more than two people riding in the forward-facing configuration thus increasing safety if a third crew member is assigned. The department discontinued orders due to issues with the Dodge chassis. In 2014, the FDNY began ordering a custom Ford F-450 Super Cab/Wheeled Coach Type I ambulance. In 2016, the FDNY began ordering a new version of the F-450/Wheeled Coach ambulances which are labeled \\"FDNY Green\\". These use a technology to reduce harmful emissions caused by the necessary idling of ambulances. In 2016, FDNY EMS ordered and received new International Terra-Star/Wheeled Coach Medium Duty Ambulances for use as \\"Rescue Medic\\" vehicles. In 2017, FDNY EMS began using Ford F-550 Super Duty/Wheeled Coach Type I ambulances.

M. (John Mews) Harcourt. Set in Perth, Western Australia, during the Great Depression, it was the first novel to be banned by the-then Commonwealth Book Censorship Board and the first to be prosecuted by police in Australia. University of New South Wales academic Richard Nile described Upsurge as \\"one of the most radical Australian books written during the interwar period\\". It was admired by Katharine Susannah Prichard, who said it was the first Australian novel to be written in the socialist realism style. Plot summary The book tells the stories of Theodora Luddon, a 20-year-old receptionist, Peter Groom, a member of the bourgeoisie who claims unemployment benefits, city magistrate James Riddle, working class man Colin Rumble who hangs himself after murdering his family, and Paul Kronen, the owner of a big drapery store. It is set in the 1930s, starts with Theodora fined two pounds by Riddle for indecent exposure at the beach and ends with Peter sentenced to a month in jail with hard labour after a riot in the city. \\"For a country in Depression, the writing about life in relief camps and corrupt officials was considered potentially incendiary.\\" Banning Three months after it was published, detectives removed copies of the novel from a Perth bookstore and asked that other copies be handed in to them. Sydney police also seized the book. In May 1934 police complained about the book to the Attorney-General's Department. All copies were removed from Perth bookstores and Harcourt left Perth following threats of prosecution. Federal authorities received complaints the novel was \\"Communist propaganda\\" and filled with obscene sexual content. The Trade and Customs Department released a report saying that the book was not without merit, but that it was grossly indecent. Upsurge was banned federally on 20 November 1934 on grounds of indecency. Critical reaction \\"The sort of stuff in Upsurge may have provided excitement of some sort to the author in the writing of it,\\" The West Australian reported. \\"It may provide excitement for some of his readers - those who carry prohibited Parisian picture-cards in their pocket wallets and scribble on walls.\\"  Notes  1934 Australian novels Obscenity controversies in literature Novels set in Western Australia ","title":"Upsurge"},{"id":"31556487","text":"Elec N√≠ hUicinn, was an Irish noblewoman, murdered 1471.

Several factors may attract a thief to a hotel. Rooms are generally empty for most of the day, with few hiding places for valuable possessions outside of a hotel's safe, which not all guests make use of. Furthermore, it is comparatively easy for a thief to leave a hotel without arousing suspicion, as guests are continually coming and going with luggage. Although hotel room security has improved, with more advanced locks, this has not eradicated hotel theft. A thief can enter a room without needing to pick a lock, for example by pretending to be a guest who has left their key in their room. Items can also be taken while a guest is distracted, for example when checking in. One of the most prolific hotel thieves was Ernest Le Ford, who stole thousands of dollars' worth of jewels from hotels in New York City in the early part of the twentieth century, including taking $8000 worth from a room at the Manhattan Square Hotel. Another nineteenth-century hotel thief successfully stole $60,000 worth of gold dust from a San Francisco hotel. Hotel guests can be considered as hotel thieves as well. CNN reported on a survey of 1,157 four- and five-star hoteliers, which items are stolen the most by guests. An astonishing 49 hotels reported that mattresses had been stolen from their premises.

Jewell, the commanding officer, is second from the right. Captain Norman \\"Bill\\" Limbury Auchinleck Jewell MBE DSC (24 October 1913 ‚Äì 18 August 2004) was an officer in the Royal Navy. As commander of the submarine HMS Seraph, Jewell was involved in one of the most vital acts of deception of the Second World War. The story of Operation Mincemeat, as the plan was known, became the subject of several books and was made into the 1955 film The Man Who Never Was.  Early life  Norman Limbury Auchinleck Jewell, or Bill as he was known, was born on Mah√© in the Seychelles on 24 October 1913 where his father was a doctor and a colonial officer. His father left his family in the Seychelles to join the British Army in East Africa during the First World War. At the end of the war, the family moved to Kenya and Jewell was sent to prep school in England and finally Oundle School before joining the Navy in 1936.  Naval career  Jewell served on HMS Osiris and HMS Otway, and in November 1940 joined HMS Truant commanded by Lt-Cdr Haggard, who was constantly seeking the enemy and was something of a mentor to Jewell. On one occasion Haggard disobeyed orders not to approach within 15 miles of Tripoli but in fact penetrated a dense minefield by following an Italian minelayer. Six months later he led battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet through the same minefield to bombard Tripoli. On 27 May 1942, Jewell took command of Seraph and its 44-man crew, little realising what part it would play in naval history. Seraph was chosen to take the American General Mark Clark and his staff to talks with Vichy French officers in Algeria. This was known as Operation Flagpole (World War II). On 19 October Jewell landed Clark's party in small collapsible canoes about 50 miles west of Algiers, with three members of the British Special Boat Section paddling them in. Seraph spent a day lying submerged in deep water but, after dark, Jewell took her in until there was less than 10 ft of water under the keel. The sea was too rough to recover the boats from the beach so Jewell took Seraph in until she was almost aground. Clark and his party then dashed for the boats, paddled hard through the surf, and were hauled on board; Seraph reached Gibraltar on 25 October. Operation Mincemeat His most famous mission, and probably most macabre, was Operation Mincemeat, widely regarded as one of the most successful disinformation exercises of the war. The intention was to deceive the Germans about Allied intentions to invade Italy in 1943. It became the subject of several books, and a 1956 film, The Man Who Never Was. As part of the ruse, a corpse, dressed as a Royal Marines officer and with a briefcase, stuffed with dummy secret papers, chained to its wrist. The body was transported in a metal container packed with ice by Bill Jewell in his submarine. On 30 April 1943, just off the port of Huelva in Spain, Jewell surfaced. He had never performed a burial at sea, but aptly chose Psalm 39. Later career and retirement In 1948, Jewell became Captain 3rd Submarine Flotilla. He was a director of the RN Staff College at Greenwich and also worked on Mountbatten's staff. He retired in 1963, and worked for the Mitchell and Butler brewery in Birmingham, where he was also life president of the Submarine Old Comrades' Association.  Awards and decorations  *MiD (1941) *MBE (1943) * DSC (1944) * Legion of Merit (1945) * Croix de Guerre with Palm (1946) Personal life Jewell married, at Pinner, Middlesex, in July 1944 Rosemary Patricia Galloway, a WRNS cipher officer. They had met at Algiers when she was stationed there after arriving in port after his part in Operation Mincemeat. The couple remained married, until her death 53 years later.

The current house was built in 1859 by George Layman Jr., one year after the original house built in 1837 by his father, George Layman Sr., was destroyed by fire. The dairy and kitchen survived the fire because they were separate from the house. Stables and a blacksmith workshop were later additions to the farm. In the 1870s, when the lack of a school in Wonnerup was an issue for the local residents, George Layman Jr. donated land near Wonnerup House for a school, which was built in 1873. In 1885 a teacher's house was constructed. The precinct was purchased by the National Trust of Australia in 1971 and opened to the public in 1973. The name Wonnerup comes from the Nyungar term. Wanna describing a woman's digging stick, up meaning water. Background Grave of George Layman Sr. in St Marys Church, Busselton, Western Australia. In 1827 George Layman, then 17 years old, immigrated to Australia from England and settled in Van Diemen's Land, Tasmania, with his brother Charles. Van Diemen's Land was initially a penal colony, but became a colony in its own right in 1824. In 1829, Layman was attacked and robbed of all his money by escaped convicts, and decided to work his passage to the new Swan River Colony, arriving in October 1829. He married Mary Ann Bayliss in Perth in 1832; the couple established a homestead in Augusta. However, Augusta failed as a settlement, and many of the settlers chose to exchange their grants there for land in the Vasse region. George and Mary Layman moved to Vasse in 1834 with their two young daughters, Harriet and Mary. Their son George Jr. was born in 1837, the same year that George built a homestead on his land. This cottage was followed by a separate dairy and kitchen complete with cellar and large ovens. The Laymans had two other children, Charles in 1838 and Catherine (Kate) in 1841. Relations between the European settlers and the native Wardandi people were strained to the point of violence, resulting in several Aboriginal deaths. In February 1841, after a long days work at the Layman property, George Layman was speared to death by Wardandi elder Gaywal. According to several witnesses including Robert Heppingstone, Layman had gotten involved in an argument between Gaywal and another Wardandi tribesman Milligan over the stealing of Milligan's allocation of damper by Gaywal. Layman pulled Gaywal's beard, which was considered a grave insult. A manhunt for Layman's killer went on for several weeks, involving much bloodshed as Captain Molloy, the Bussell brothers, and troops killed an unknown number of Aboriginals. One source has described these events which later became known as the Wonnerup Massacre; however, no government records were written to describe the event.There are no official records of the massacre and sources suggest anywhere from 5 to 300 were killed. s:History of West Australia by Warren Burt Kimberley, published in 1897, chapter 13, page 116, describes: The black men were killed by the dozens and their corpses lined the route of the march...their bones could still be seen in 1897. However, there is no estimate of nor actual number given in this source. Other, more recent sources quote a number of 250 to 300, though none of these appear to be supported anywhere other than oral history of unknown origin. A newspaper report of the time states that only 5 were killed. The posse eventually shot Gaywal and captured his three sons, two of whom were imprisoned on Rottnest Island. A year after George's death, Mary married Robert Heppingstone. They had two children, Arthur and Robert. Heppingstone owned a whaling operation that operated from Castle Rock, in addition to running the Wonnerup farm. On 6 September 1858, the whaling boat Champion with Heppingstone at the tiller was ferrying goods in rough seas from the Castle Bay whaling station to a boat offshore. While turning, it was hit by a wave that threw Heppingstone across the boat, and before he could recover, a second wave hit, upending the boat. Three crewmen were rescued, but Heppingstone drowned in the accident. Earlier that same year, in February 1858, the Layman cottage burned to the ground; only the dairy and kitchen in the separate building escaped the flames. At this stage, 20-year-old George Layman Jr. took over the management of the farm and the whaling operation. In July 1859 George married Amelia Harriet Curtis and started building a new house, the current Wonnerup House, for his family using local limestone and timbers. The wooden roof shingles were later covered with a corrugated iron. House The house was built in stages, with four rooms and a hall at the outset and a kitchen and scullery added around 1862. In 1925 a bathroom and toilet were introduced. Expansion of the kitchen and dairy which survived the fire was completed in 1872. In the 1880s and 1890s, Wonnerup House was one of the district's most lucrative dairy farms. The main gates were cast-iron-mounted onto limestone columns. These gates were erected to the memory of George Layman Sr. A tablet set into the columns reads: \\"George Layman came to Western Australia in 1829 aged 18 years, Augusta 1830, Wonnerup 1834, speared by natives 1841\\". Land One of the bedrooms with furniture that belonged to the Layman family. The land on which Wonnerup House stands was originally surveyed as Sussex lot 4, which George Layman Sr. purchased after he received title to Sussex lot 3, some 500 acres. Over time, the Layman family purchased adjoining acreage; at its peak, the farm covered an area of over . George Layman Jr. handed over management of the farm to his youngest son, James, in the 1900s. After James' death in 1911, the farm was passed back to his parents and four unmarried sisters to manage. Eventually a nephew took over the management, and in 1962, with the death of the last Layman sister, the farm was sold and subdivided, with the parcel of land upon which Wonnerup House and associated buildings are located being acquired by the National Trust of Australia in 1971. This sale included the furniture, personal effects and indigenous aboriginal artifacts collected by the Layman family since 1829. In 1973 the National Trust opened Wonnerup House to the public and the Western Australian Government then gave the old school house and teacher's residence site to the National Trust. =School and teacher's house= Over the road are the school (1873) and teacher's house (1885) built on land given to the government by George Layman Jr. References External links * Wonnerup ‚Äì National Trust of Australia (WA) State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Busselton Historic house museums in Western Australia Busselton National Trust of Western Australia ","title":"Wonnerup House"},{"id":"31556856","text":"Benjamin Henry Day Jr. (March 7, 1838Dwight, Benjamin Woodbridge.

Type 1 is characterized by high levels of Bacteroides, type 2 has few Bacteroides but Prevotella are common, and type 3 has high levels of Ruminococcus. The value of classifying by enterotype has been challenged.

In addition, the water masses drained from the Swiss Alps are intensively used by run-of-the-river hydroelectricity (ROR). With 9,052 kWh per person in 2008, the country's electricity consumption is relatively high and was 22% above the European Union's average. In 2013, net generated electricity amounted to 66.2 terawatt- hours (TWh). About 60% of Switzerland's electricity generation comes from renewable sources, most of it from hydro (56.6%), while non-hydro renewables supplied a small contribution of 3.4%. Nuclear contributed 37.6% to the country's electricity production and only about 2.5% were generated by fossil fuel based thermal power stations.Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE, Schweizerische Statistik der erneuerbaren Energien 2013 , p. 2 and 6, 25 September 2014Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) Electricity statistics 2013 (in French and German) , p. 2 and 3, 23 June 2014  Consumption  According to IEA the electricity use (gross production + imports ‚Äì exports ‚Äì transmission/distribution losses) in Switzerland was in 2004 60.6 TWh, (2007) 61.6 TWh and (2008) 63.5 TWh.

Hydro power  Hydroelectricity is by far the country's most important source of energy, and contributing more than half to its electricity generation. Hydro power is generally divided into conventional hydroelectricity (using a dam) and run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. In addition, pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PHS) plays an important role in Switzerland, being used in combination with base load power plants and to green-washing nuclear power from France. = Small hydro = The KEV remuneration (see below) also applies to small-scale hydro power plants with nameplate capacities up to 10 megawatts.  Nuclear power  There are four nuclear power plants, with a total of five operational reactors. In 2013, they produced 24.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. Nuclear power accounted for 36.4% of the nation's gross electricity generation of 68.3 TWhSwiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) Electricity statistics 2013 (in French and German) , 23 June 2014 In addition, there are a number of research reactors in Switzerland, one of them at the EPFL. In 2011, the federal authorities decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in Switzerland as a consequence of the Fukushima accident in Japan. In late 2013 the operator BKW decided to cease all electrical generation in 2019 in the M√ºhleberg plant As of December 8, 2014, the National Council has voted to limit the operational life-time of the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant‚Äîwhich houses the oldest commercial reactor of the world‚Äîto 60 years, forcing decommissioning upon its two reactors by 2029 and 2031, respectively., Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, [schweiz/nationalrat-will-beznau- nach-60-jahren-vom-netz-nehmen-1.18440712 Nationalrat will Beznau nach 60 Jahren vom Netz nehmen (in German)], 8 December 2014  Non-hydro renewables  = Feed-in remuneration at cost (KEV)= The federal government adopted feed-in tariffs to offer a cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers. The feed-in remuneration at cost (KEV, , , ) is the primary instrument for promoting the deployment of power systems using renewable energy sources. It covers the difference between the production and the market price, and guarantees producers of electricity from renewable sources a price that corresponds to their production costs. The following renewable energy sources are supported by the KEV remuneration: distributed small hydro (with capacities up to 10 MW), solar photovoltaics, wind power, geothermal energy, biomass and biogas (from agriculture, waste and water treatment). The KEV remuneration is financed by collecting a surcharge on the consumed kilowatt- hour of electricity. As in other countries, industries with a large electricity consumption are exempt from the surcharge, which has gradually been increased and stands at 1.5 cents per kWh as of 2014.Die Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, (in German), 20 August 2014 The remuneration tariffs for renewables have been specified based on reference power plants for each individual technology. Feed-in tariffs are applicable for 20 to 25 years, depending on the technology. In view of the anticipated technological progress and the increasing degree of market maturity of renewables energy technologies (especially for solar PV), the feed-in tariffs are subjected to a gradual reduction once or twice a year. These reductions only apply to new production facilities that are put into operation. Planned installations of renewable power facilities have to be registered with Swissgrid, the national network operator. As of the end of 2014, a growing waiting list for solar photovoltaic systems has accumulated as demand excess the capped capacities given by the currently available funds of the KEV remuneration. = Wind power = Swiss wind power accounted for only 89 GWh or 0.1% of net-electricity production in 2013. = Solar power = For many years, Switzerland's pace of deploying solar PV had been lagging significantly behind its neighboring Germany and Italy. However, installed capacity of solar PV increased by 300 MW or 69% to 737 MW in 2013 and is likely to continue its strong growth due to the recently ramped up KEV funds. In 2014, another installed 320 MW brought the country beyond the gigawatt mark and the IEA-PVPS estimates the now installed capacity sufficient to supply close to 2% of the domestic electricity demands. = Geothermal power = An induced seismicity in Basel led the city to suspend a geothermal energy project and conduct a seismic hazard evaluation, which resulted in its cancellation in December 2009.

It seeks to change the way that markets work, so that poor people are included in the benefits of growth and economic development. The aim is to tackle market failures and strengthen the private sector in a way that creates large-scale, lasting benefits for the poor. All poor people already participate in markets, whether as workers, subsistence farmers, consumers or entrepreneurs. Strengthening these markets in ways that secure higher incomes from or access to goods and services for the poor is therefore seen by M4P advocates as a sustainable way to fight poverty at scale. The approach utilises systems analysis as a means of diagnosing and addressing the constraints that face poor and disadvantaged people in improving their position within markets. The approach conceptualises systems as inclusive of core markets, supporting functions, and the formal and informal rules that affect how the system works. As such, the market systems approach analyses functions of private market actors, individuals, government organisations and social and cultural norms in order to understand how a system operates. M4P is an overarching approach to development that provides agencies and governments with the direction required to achieve large-scale, sustainable change in different contexts. Focused on the underlying constraints that prevent the effective development of market systems that involve or exclude poor people. Market systems approaches to development have now been applied outside the field of enterprise development. Programmes are currently ongoing in health systems; water, hygiene and sanitation; education; land markets; and governance.  References   Literature  * Albu, M (2007).

Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology. Psychology According to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that \\"religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice.\\" (Whitley & Kite, 2010) Whitley, B.E. & Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA. Wadsworth. Naturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, \\"These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation.\\" (Whitley & Kite, 2010) Measuring Allport & Ross developed a means of measuring religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967).Allport, G. W., & Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious morientation and prejudice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-443. A sample statement from this scale would be ‚ÄúThe church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships‚Äù (Whitley & Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger & Jacson, 2005).Hunsberger, B., & Jackson, L. M. (2005). Religion, Meaning, and Prejudice. Journal of Social Issues, 61(4), 807-826. Extrinsic Extrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non- religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end. It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in extrinsic religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in extrinsic religious orientation use religion, ‚Äúto provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification‚Äù (Allport &Ross;, 1967, p. 434). (Whitley & Kite, 2010) =Prejudice= Hunsberger & Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005). Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation, but there has been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger & Jackson, 2005). Intrinsic According to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempts to live their life as their religion teaches that they should (Whitley & Kite, 2010). This agrees with what Daniel Batson implies; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, \\"An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends.\\" Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. =Prejudice= Research has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They \\"live\\" their religion, and as a result those \\"with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter- group tolerance.\\" Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays. This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to view homosexuality as behavior the Bible prohibits. While this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias. Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition. =Example= An example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life. Quest orientation A third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, \\"An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought.\\" =Prejudice= Intuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the \\"Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice\\" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of \\"universal love and compassion\\" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion. =Example= Examples of people who have attained a quest orientation are Gautama Buddha, Malcolm X, and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

Sectarian violence among Muslims is the ongoing conflict between Muslims of different sects, most commonly Shias and Sunnis, although the fighting extends to smaller, more specific branches within these sects, as well as Sufism. It has been documented as having gone on from Islam's beginnings up until contemporary times. Modern =In Iraq= Following the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and subsequent fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, the minority Sunni sect, which had previously enjoyed increased benefits under Saddam's rule, now found itself out of power as the Shia majority, suppressed under Saddam, sought to establish power. Such sectarian tensions resulted in a violent insurgency waged by different Sunni and Shia militant groups, such as al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Mahdi Army. Following the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, violence has increased to 2008 levels. In February 2006, more than 100 people were killed across Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left over a hundred people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed. =In Lebanon= =In Pakistan= =In Saudi Arabia= The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al Shaykh, issued a fatwa on 12 September 2013 that suicide bombings are \\"great crimes\\" and bombers are \\"criminals who rush themselves to hell by their actions\\". Sheikh described suicide bombers as \\"robbed of their minds... who have been used (as tools) to destroy themselves and societies.\\" On 16 September 2013 he condemned violence against non-Muslims living in Islamic countries or Muslims labeled as infidels. The Grand Mufti condemned acts that cause the \\"shedding of blood of Muslims and of those living in their counties in peace.\\" Sheikh Al Shaykh stated, \\"Given the dangerous developments in the Muslim world, I would like to warn against the danger of attacking Muslims and those (non-Muslims) under Muslim protection.\\" \\"In view of the fast-moving dangerous developments in the Islamic world, it is very distressing to see the tendencies of permitting or underestimating the shedding of blood of Muslims and those under protection in their countries. The sectarian or ignorant utterances made by some of these people would benefit none other than the greedy, vindictive and envious people. Hence, we would like to draw attention to the seriousness of the attacks on Muslims or those who live under their protection or under a pact with them,\\" Sheikh Al-AsShaikh said, quoting a number of verses from the Qur'an and Hadith. However, the Government of Saudi Arabia does discriminate against and/or persecute Shia Muslims, Ahmadiyaa and even non ‚Äì Salafist Sunni Islam.Robert Murray Thomas Religion in Schools: Controversies Around the World Greenwood Publishing Group 2006 page 180 =In Somalia= Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a is a Somali paramilitary group consisting of Sufis and moderates opposed to the radical islamist group Al-Shabaab.

Bahrain's Shia majority has often complained of receiving poor treatment in employment, housing, and infrastructure, while Sunnis have preferential status. The Bahraini government has reportedly imported Sunnis from Pakistan and Syria in an attempt to increase the Sunni percentage. Shiite Muslims are blocked from serving in important political and military posts. Sunnis and Shia often stress that, no matter what their denomination, they are all Bahrainis first and foremost. However, sectarianism seethes below the surface of society. Minor sectarian clashes have occurred during the Bahraini uprising. On 4 March 2011, about six people were injured in Hamad Town and police intervened to disperse young Shi'ites and largely recently naturalised Sunni Arabs who clashed with knives, sticks and swords, witnesses said. It is unclear what caused the incident, with both sides blaming the other for the outbreak of violence. This incident marks the first sectarian violence since protests erupted on 14 February. A spokesman for Al Wefaq opposition party said the clashes were due to a dispute between families in the area and weren't sectarian. Others said that Shiite youth had targeted naturalised Sunnis living in the area. =Indonesia= In February 2011 three members of the Ahmadiyya movement were killed after a mob surrounded them accusing them of heresy.Indonesia Ahmadiyah Muslim sect killings condemned retrieved 6 February 2012 See also *Islamic schools and branches *Sectarian violence *Sectarian violence among Christians *Persecution of minority Muslim groups Persecution of Ahmadis References Further reading * McTernan, Oliver J. 2003.

William Slater Calverley (1847‚Äì1898) was an unassuming rural English vicar who through diligent study and painstaking scrutiny became an extraordinary amateur antiquarian. Although born in Leicestershire, Calverley claimed his fame through interpreting the carved sculptured relics that he and others found in Cumberland churchyards. He made intricate drawings, corresponded with academic authorities, and gave his own interpretations, which he then relayed to a wider audience. Calverley later produced in intricate detail a life-sized reproduction of the famous Gosforth Cross, which now stands in Aspatria churchyard. The Rev W. S. Calverley, Antiquarian Biography =Religion and education= William Slater Calverley (1847‚Äì1898) was born at Kibworth, Leicestershire in 1847. After completing his formal education he entered New College, Oxford, but left to take up private tuition before attaining his degree. During this period he began to study art at the South Kensington School of Art and according to contemporary reports could have achieved the gold medal but for illness. This period of study proved very useful later in life. Notwithstanding his artistic ability he chose to enter the church. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Goodwin at Carlisle, Cumberland, in 1872 and afterwards became curate of Eskdale parish, South Cumberland. In the following year he took priest's orders and assumed an appointment as curate at Maryport, moving in 1874 to Dearham, where he served three years as curate and eight years as vicar of the same church. Under his guidance the church was restored, the vicarage and church yard enlarged and improved, and the district church at Ellenborough founded. In 1885, he became vicar of St. Kentigern's Church, Aspatria. One important feature of his pastorate of Aspatria was the acquisition of a peal of bells for the church.West Cumberland Times, 24 September 1898. =Antiquarianism= Grave Stone Memorial for W S Calverley at St. Kentigern's Church, Aspatria, designed by his friend and colleague, W. G. Collingwood, and based on the Dearham CrossTownend, 2009, p.150 Calverley ignited an interest in local and ancient history during the church restorations at Dearham, which brought to light remains of ancient art. Through the study of pre-Norman stones and artefacts he became one of the world's foremost antiquarian scholars. After finding several pre-Norman sculptures he contacted leading authorities, and formed a close working relationship with the English born professor, George Stephens of Copenhagen University. Stephens incorporated and embodied Calverley's discoveries and descriptions into one of the chapters of his book Old Northern Runic MonumentsTransactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society 1883 The communications with Stephens encouraged Calverley to delve deeper into the subject and in 1883 he announced to the Archaeological Institute at Carlisle, his reading of Edda myths on the Christian cross at Gosforth, West Cumberland.\\"The Sculptured Cross at Gosforth\\", by the Rev. W. S. Calverley, printed in the Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society 1993 The news created a sensation; prior to these discovery authorities held that Christian monuments contained nothing but Christian subjects. Although others had tried to make a connection with Buddhism, Druidism, and Astronomy, Calverley identified the 'Pagan overlap' in English relics. His critics were finally silenced after the Rev. G. F. Browne (later Bishop of Bristol) published his research into the meaning of the Scandinavian legends on the cross at Leeds, and the one at Kirk Andreas, Isle of Man. In February 1891, Calverley interpreted the V√∂lsung myth at Halton in a lecture to the Lancaster Philosophical Society and later that year he read a paper on the same subject to an audience at the Royal Archaeological Institute at Edinburgh. Calverley at Aspatria The Replica Gosforth Cross at Aspatria As vicar at Aspatria, Calverley began to study the ancient relics of that parish. He made intricate drawings of the 'Standing Cross', which at that time stood in its own rectangular socket in the south side of the churchyard, and compared its markings to other artefacts in the county. He also studied the Saxon hogbacks, the swastikas, the two spiral shafts, the spiral fragments and began to draw conclusions, which related to the age and importance of the site of the ancient church. Having realised the importance of these relics he removed them to the vestry. All of his conclusions remain his testimony today. However, it was his interpretation of the meaning of the spiral markings on the Gosforth Cross which assured his fame. Not content to make sketches of the carvings, Calverley determined to make an exact life-size reproduction a means of understanding the Masonic mystery of the sculpture. Aspatria parish is rich in red freestone and in due course he acquired from the local quarries, a solid piece of rock 2 feet wide, 2 feet thick and 16 feet long. With the aid of a retired master mason he carved out the cross and then proceeded with the carving. He reproduced the markings in intricate detail and the replica cross now stands in its own socket in the east end of Aspatria churchyard, a few feet away from Calverley's final resting place.Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.139-167 As to the significance of the Gosforth Cross; Stephens, on visiting the site, pronounced it, \\"one of the costliest olden Roods in Europe\\" ‚Äì unique in all his experience, and \\"probably of seventh century date.\\"Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.140 In Calverley's opinion it was a Christian monument, not an heathen pillar surmounted by a cross. He described it as an \\"elaborately carved Christian cross set in a socket of three Calvary steps.\\".Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.141 Some of the decorations on the Replica Gosforth Cross 1 Academic achievements Calverley was elected F.S.A. (Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries) in 1885, and in that capacity served as the Cumberland secretary, reporting new finds. He was also a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. In addition to delivering a large number of technical papers to a variety of Societies and historical organisations he was heavily involved in the excavation of the Hardknott Roman Fort, South Cumberland. He also became one of the committee of experts who superintended the exploration of Hadrian's Wall in northern England.Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.iii-x He died before the publication of his magnum opus entitled Notes on the Early Sculptured Crosses, Shrines and Monuments in the Present Diocese of Carlisle, which was published in 1898 with W. G. Collingwood as editor. Civic duties Calverley took a keen interest in the affairs of Aspatria. He occupied a seat on the Local Board, and afterwards the Aspatria Urban District Council. He also had a position on the Aspatria and Brayton School Board.West Cumberland Times, 24 September 1898 Some of the decorations on the Replica Gosforth Cross 2 Academic contributions * All references below, unless otherwise stated, were written for the Cumberland and Westmoreland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society and are printed in their Transactions. * Notes on the Sculptured Stones at Dearham Church, Read at Dearham, 17 June 1880. * Illustrations of Teutonic Mythology from early Christian Monuments at Brigham and Dearham.

It was active from the late 1930s until the early 1950s. History Inkundla Ya Bantu was first published in April 1938 under the name Territorial Magazine. It was renamed in June 1940. Its distribution area covered at first the rural parts of the Eastern Cape and Southern Parts of KwaZulu-Natal and then expanded to the Johannesburg and Witwatersrand area. The newspaper was a monthly at first and in 1943 became a fortnightly publication and then a weekly. In its last two years it returned to sporadic monthly issues. Inkundla Ya Bantu was the only independent, 100% black-owned newspaper at the time. It played a significant role in African politics. Inlkundla ya Bantu was the only newspaper of its kind that enjoyed national coverage. Because of this, Inkundla Ya Bantu was uniquely free to publish material, including political material, without fear. Inkundla Ya Bantu was sympathetic to the oppressed Africans and was concerned with highlighting their plight. Inkundla reported articles on both communist and anti-communist Trade unions and was a passionate supporter of the marginalised. = Editors = Inkundla Ya Bantu's first editor was Phillip Goduka Katamzi. Katamzi was succeeded by Govan Mbeki after a year. Mbeki remained editor until he resigned in 1943. Jordan Kush Ngubane followed, remaining until the end.  Controversy  Accounts differ over who held the title of editor during 1939 and 1943. It is generally agreed upon by most scholars that Philip Katamzi was the first editor and that he held this position for about a year. Thereafter he handed over his duties to Govan Mbeki, and Mbeki edited the newspaper until 1943 when he resigned. However, the other version states that Govan Mbeki was never the editor and that Phillip Katamzi was the editor for five years. The first version is more popular, but Jordan Ngubane himself supported the second version.ukpanah,2005:62 Mbeki and his wife Epainette Mbeki, made regular contributions to Inkundla Ya Bantu during the time that he was believed to have been the editor. = African National Congress Youth League = Inkundla Ya Bantu openly supported African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) and published many of its members' articles, most notably Anton Lembede, who was ANCYL president. Lembede was the mastermind behind ANCYL's political philosophy at the time, especially relating to African Nationalism. The ANC had no official press of its own. The newspaper often acted as the mouthpiece of the party and its youth league. The newspaper's editor's were prominent ANC figures. For instance Mbeki was an ANC leader and became the Secretary of High Command of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. Ngubane was one of the founding members of ANCYL. Mbeki was a firm communist and Ngubane a \\"virulent anticommunist\\".

Background The main seaports in England in the early 1800s were well served by numerous religious organisations that devoted themselves to the religious welfare of seafarers of merchant and navy ships. These societies were the precursors of the 'seamen's missions' still to be found in ports all over the world which provide social facilities, of more than a purely religious character. Crews are able to spend spare time ashore relaxing in a friendly and welcoming 'club-like' atmosphere. The Bethel ships provided by The Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen ( now known as the Fishermens Mission) provided restbite, medical care, and when requested services at sea, to those who worked in what was and is still considered to be the most dangerous job in the world outside of the armed forces during conflict, the Fishermen, they would go out with the Fishing fleets taking many of the same risks in the freezing weather to look after the welfare of the Fishermen. The Fishermens Mission is still with us today as the only Charity to exclusively look after fishermen and their families Welfare, providing emergency support alongside practical, financial, spiritual and emotional care for all fishermen, active or retired, and their families. https://www.fishermensmission.org.uk/about-us/our-history/ One of these groups was known as the Bethel Movement whose activities were focused on chaplains conducting services on board ships lying in the port of London, and distributing religious tracts to crews, which spread to other ports of the British Empire such as Liverpool and Bristol and Sydney. Bethel is a Hebrew word meaning 'House of God'. Following a perceived need for a more formal organisation in 1819 to be known as the Bethel Union was founded. Britain Sydney In Sydney, a Bethel Union Society was formed in 1822. In 1828 the Hobart Bethel Union Society was founded by George Augustus Robinson\\"Classified Advertising\\", _The Hobart Town Courier_ 26 January 1828: and set up on board a former magazine ship in Sullivan's Cove in 1828.\\"SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\\" _The Tasmanian_ 2 May 1828: 2. . A more permanent base for the Sydney organisation was obtained from the colonial authorities in 1832, on Darling Harbour, which was moved in 1851. Five years later a site was obtained on Circular Quay ('The Rocks') and a church built in 1859, with an Annual Service to seafarers. The facilities were extended in the 1870s. In 1895, the Church of England Mission to Seamen became a Branch of the Missions to Seamen, England. Further extensions of the Sydney Bethel Union were made in 1910 with a recreation hall, a new chapel and a vestry, administrative offices, a library and an Officers' Room with some accommodation cubicles, a gymnasium, smoking room and other facilities were added. On redevelopment of Circular Quay in the 1970s, a new site was obtained at 11-15 Macquarie Place, Sydney. It was opened in April 1977. Changes in the patterns of ship operations (smaller crews and faster turn round times) soon prompted At this time rapid changes were occurring in international shipping and these affected the operations of the Mission. Macquarie Place was sold in 1985 and a property at 320-324 Sussex Street obtained and the new facilities opened in 1993.

The College has also been an accredited institution of the Irish state accreditation agencies since 1996 (NCEA from 1996 to 1999, HETAC from 1999 to 2014, QQI from 2014 to the present). The college was the subject of a critical report by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC, now absorbed into QQI), which highlighted a series of institutional failures at the American College and made no less than 37 recommendations for change. The college was reprimanded for calling itself the ‚ÄúIrish American University‚Äù when it had no status as a university. However, the college did submit an institutional review to HETAC in June 2011, in which they outlined a number of steps they had taken to improve quality.\\" \\", American College Dublin, Institutional Review, Progress report submitted in accordance with the accreditation requirements of the Higher Education and Training Award Council, June 2011 The College underwent in 2010 an institutional review as part of the cyclical accreditation process of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC, now absorbed into QQI).

Program Changes In 2010, the Psychological Society of Ireland (PSI) limited the term of its validation of the College's psychology program to one year, in the course of which it required new validation criteria to be met. Given the uncertainty about the future of the program's PSI validation, the College arranged for students who wished to complete the degree under PSI validation to transfer to a similar program at Dublin Business School.

The site contains structural remains and artifacts relating to the Thule/Inuit culture dating back to approximately 700 to 800 years ago. Research on the site has focused on the study of wood sources, procurement strategies, settlement patterns and examination of why semi-subterranean structures remained long after this type of housing was abandoned years before. The impact of climate change and continuous contact with Euro- Canadians and its effect on Inuit Culture is also examined. Introduction Research from the Qijurittuq site began in 2007 as part of a study looking at the effect of climate change on the Thule/Inuit culture and the Paleo-Eskimos of the Hudson Bay area.Desrosiers, Pierre M., et al., The Qijurittuq site (IbGk-3), Eastern Hudson Bay: An IPY Interdisciplinary Study. 2010. 227-243 Web The research was part of the Global International Polar Year project.International Arctic Research Center (IARC) - The Global IPY Project (www.iarc.uaf.edu) The Nunavik component of this global project was initially oriented towards the investigation of Thule/Inuit archaeology in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, within a context of climatic change. The Qijurittuq site research is directed at change in semi-subterranean dwellings and whether it was due to climate change, technology, and/or procurement strategies. Site excavation The Qijurittuq site (IbGk-3) research is directed to four areas: palaeoenvironmental data with a focus on the Little Ice Age, archaeological information from Qijurittuq and other related sites, local people and their traditional knowledge and cultural history, and ethno-historical research focused on reasons of abandonment of semi-subterranean dwellings in the Eastern Arctic. The Qijurittuq site is on Drayton Island, along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavik, in Northern Quebec in the Hopewell archipelago. The site is located in a valley protected from the harsh winds during the fall and early winter. The landscape is characterized by continuous permafrost zone with strong winds blowing the fall and winter, shrub tundra with willow, birch, herbaceous plants, mosses and lichens. The islands are characterized by Cuesta formations of sandstone, quartzite and dolomite, with steep cliffs on one side and gentle slopes to seaward. Siltstone, found throughout the area, was utilized by the first Paleo-Eskimos to make tools. The site has nineteen structures, of which thirteen are semi-subterranean houses, pointing to a fall and winter occupational period. Also included are structures indicating spring and summer occupation, typical of the Late Paleo- Eskimo time period. Paleo-Eskimo structures were typically tents constructed of driftwood poles and covered with skins secured by a ring of rocks with stones creating a mid-passage that divided the living areas. Three additional sites were near the Qijurittuq site, IbGk-7 thought to be spring and summer month occupations with evidence of tent rings, food cache, fox traps and graves. Site IbGk-7 was located near the water, down the valley with sites IbGk-8 and IbGk-38 located on top of the hill overlooking the valley to the north and south, exposed to the winds from every side. =Local Involvement= The excavations included local high school students from Inukjuak. The trainees were exposed basic archeology techniques like collecting artifacts, recording data, basic excavation, dendrochronology, as well as geomorphology. Elders of the community shared their experiences traditional life in the area. Upon touring the site, the elders were amazed to discover how much wood was used by their ancestors in the construction of their houses. Traditional storytelling of ancestral life in the area, and recalling memories from childhood also aided in the research. Results and continuous evaluations The Qijurittuq site was occupied by Paleo-Eskimo and Thule/Inuit peoples who lived in the semi-subterranean houses. A total of 29,085 lithic tools and debris was collected along with 2,577 animal bones and teeth, 14 objects of worked bones and ivory, as well as 215 charcoal samples, 100 wood samples, 38 mineral/organic sediment samples and six metal pieces including one barbed point and two nails or rivets. In addition 17 lithic raw material sources and 3 quarry sites were also sampled. Peat monoliths helped catalog the vegetation and climate history of the region. A decline of certain species occurred due to the onset of the Little Ice Age, which was characterized by cooler and drier conditions. With ancestral knowledge being very important to research, local elders visited the site and described memories of past weather patterns, and recalled family stories of housing and stone tools that were used. They shared memories of the homes, such as entryways with an area for drying clothes, elevated beds, and the used of mattresses made from branches, grass, cloth, and caribou skin. They expressed that while present summers are warmer and start earlier, the weather now is much less predictable than in the past, and there are types of insects and fauna that had not been seen before. Much colder conditions in the past, may have accompanied the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850 A.D. With wood being scarce in the tundra region, the elders were very curious of how so much wood came to be on the Qijurittuq site to construct these semi-subterranean homes. In studying the architecture of the houses, the research shows that they were typical houses that are similar across the Arctic. Some elders believed that the wood was driftwood and some believed it to be from the tree line 100 m inland near the Boniface River. After radiocarbon dates were taken from various wood samples in the structures, it was determined that wood in the structures came from two different species. Cross-dating done with one sample showed a potential connection with a series from inland along the Boniface River 2. Geografisk Tidsskrift 110(2). Web. suggesting the wood used in the roofs of the houses were from there as well as driftwood accumulating over some 400 years. The conditions to preserve the logs were poor, and research indicated that these dwellings were not re-occupied after 200 years. Abandonment The most visible architectural structure in the Canadian Arctic is the semi- subterranean dwelling. Research of the three Thule/Inuit structures and middens showed that it was almost all associated with Palaeo-eskimo occupation. Studying the strata and ancient environment shows that the Thule/Inuit people had occupied the vacant dwellings several hundred years after Paleo-Eskimo people chose to leave them behind. The large amount of work invested in Structure 1 led researchers to believe it was built with long-term occupation in mind by the Thule/Inuit. Dwellings found in the Central and high Arctic, were normally composed of Bowhead whale bone. During the Thule migration however, wood was more abundant, allowing the construction of semi- subterranean housing made with wood. Research suggests that the Qijurittuq houses were the last ones built in Nunavik. Some believe abandonment of semi- subterranean dwellings started at the beginning of the Little Ice Age and before the 16th Century. In Labrador, these types of dwellings were believed to be used until the end of the 17th Century when shared sod houses came into the picture. These sod houses varied in size and structure and were built out of necessity when snow was not abundant. This may have been due to warmer climate conditions. However, none have been found in the Nunavik area of Hudson Bay, and semi-subterranean homes were used until the 19th Century. Also important at this time, contact was being made with fur trappers from Europe, and eventually an establishment of trading posts and long distance trading called for increased mobility to trap animals and the need for less permanent housing, thus not a lot of energy was put into building a long-term use home.

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig announced that the takeover was due to concerns over the team's finances, and a loss of confidence in the ability of owner Frank McCourt to run the team. Selig announced his intention to appoint an overseer to supervise the day-to-day financial management of the Dodgers. In June, as the Dodgers struggled to meet payroll, Selig rejected a TV contract that would have pumped money into the organization. This led to the Dodgers filing for bankruptcy, and being forced to negotiate a loan with the MLB to keep the club operating. After a year of negotiations and court proceedings, the dispute ended with the sale of the team to Guggenheim Baseball Management LLC.  Background  Frank McCourt and his wife Jamie purchased the Dodgers from the Fox Entertainment Group in 2004. In order to arrange the purchase, he needed a $145 million loan from Fox, for which he used his Boston parking lots as collateral. Fox eventually foreclosed on the parking lot property and sold it. Under McCourt's ownership of the Dodgers the team made the playoffs four times, advancing to the NLCS twice. On October 14, 2009, it was announced the McCourts would be separating after nearly 30 years of marriage. While speculation was raised on the impact upon the McCourt family Dodger ownership, a spokesperson for Jamie McCourt said the following day that \\"the focus of the Dodgers is on the playoffs and the World Series\\". Jamie McCourt was fired from her position as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs, thus ending the reign of the self-proclaimed \\"First Female CEO of a Baseball Team.\\" She officially filed for divorce shortly thereafter. Frank McCourt then accused her of having an affair with her bodyguard and changed the locks on her office. Frank McCourt claimed at the time that the divorce would have \\"no bearing on the team whatsoever\\". \\" On December 7, 2010 the judge in the divorce case invalidated the post-nuptial marital property agreement (\\"MPA\\") that Frank McCourt had claimed provided him with sole ownership of the Dodgers. In the wake of this decision Frank McCourt's lawyers said that Frank would use other legal avenues to establish his sole ownership of the Dodgers, while Jamie McCourt's lawyers said that Jamie would be confirmed as the co- owner of the team as community property of their marriage. On March 31, 2011, after the Opening Day game against the San Francisco Giants, a Giants fan was attacked by two men wearing Dodgers attire in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. The fan suffered serious injuries and was diagnosed with brain damage. McCourt was criticized for his response to the incident. The attack put a damper on attendance at Dodger games, and led to the Dodgers incurring increased expenses in security. On April 5, 2011, McCourt presented Selig's office with a contract giving Fox broadcasting rights to the team for the next 20 years. The deal is said to be valued at between US$2.5 to US$3 billion. Fox also provided McCourt with a personal loan of $30 million to cover the Dodgers payroll. To secure the loan, McCourt promised Fox he would pay them back with money from a settlement or judgment against the lawfirm that drafted the invalidated marital agreement. The lawfirm responded to the report by filing a lawsuit against McCourt, seeking a judicial declaration that the firm is not responsible for him losing control of the Dodgers Just prior to the MLB taking over the Dodgers, the website TMZ.com reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating Frank & Jamie McCourt in response to allegations that they had been taking money out of the Dodgers for years without paying taxes. = Bud Selig's statement = In a statement to the press on April 20, 2011, Commissioner Bud Selig stated the following: Reactions to Selig's move have been generally positive. For example, The New York Times baseball journalist Tyler Kepner editorialized that \\"Bud Selig has never looked better than he does right now.\\" However, ESPN correspondent Gene Wojciechowski criticized Selig and MLB, making the case that Selig and the 29 other MLB owners at the time turned a blind eye to the financial problems that the McCourts were known to have when they purchased the team in 2004. = Frank McCourt's statement = In a statement to the press on April 20, 2011, owner Frank McCourt responded: Steve Soboroff, hired by McCourt as the Dodgers vice chairman April 19, 2011, described the takeover of the team's operations as \\"irresponsible\\". =Tom Schieffer appointed= On April 25, 2011, Selig appointed Tom Schieffer, former Ambassador to Japan and former President of the Texas Rangers, to oversee the team's finances. Schieffer must approve any team expenditure over $5,000. Divorce settlement and rejection of TV deal In June, the cash-strapped McCourt struggled to meet payroll, only meeting it with help from some of his friends. As the Dodgers' end-of-June payroll, which included over $8 million in deferred payments to former Dodger Manny Ramirez, neared, it was reported that McCourt would be unable to meet payroll without the approval of a 17-year, $3 billion TV deal with Fox Sports Net. However, on June 20, MLB commissioner Bud Selig declined to approve the deal. Selig's action also voided a settlement reached on June 17 between Frank and Jamie that divided their assets apart from the Dodgers. On August 4, a one-day trial was scheduled to decide whether the Dodgers was community property of Frank and Jamie McCourt or the property of Frank alone. However, the trial was canceled when the Dodgers filed for bankruptcy. Later, the court agreed to a 30- to 45-day trial to settle the divorce, and decide who owned the Dodgers. The trial was expected to start in spring or summer of 2012. In the meantime they agreed to sell some of their residential holdings.Final Frank and Jamie McCourt divorce trial? Wait till next year On October 17, 2011 it was announced that the McCourts had reached a settlement in their divorce case, in which Jamie would give up her claims on the Dodgers and Frank would pay her about $130 million. The divorce is believed to have been the costliest in California history.Frank and Jamie McCourt reach settlement involving Dodgers Bankruptcy Court On June 27, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the filing, the Dodgers sought permission to use a $150 million loan from a hedge fund for daily operations, according to a team news release. If approved, this would allow the team to meet its payroll obligations to Ramirez, Andruw Jones, and others. Dodgers file for bankruptcy protection After the filing, the Dodgers told Tom Schieffer that he no longer had any authority in relation to the Dodgers and refused to let him return to work.Bankruptcy forces monitors out of Dodger Stadium MLB filed their own response to the bankruptcy filing, in which they said that the court should reject McCourt's bid to save his ownership by \\"threatening the immediate demise of one of baseball's great teams.\\" They also asked the court to consider if McCourt should remain the owner during the proceedings and if Schieffer can remain in his position.MLB slams McCourt in bankruptcy court filing In the court hearing on June 28, the Dodgers and MLB agreed that the Dodgers could use the hedge fund financing temporarily, pending a July 20 hearing on MLB's request to take over funding of the Dodgers. The language in McCourt's original filing asking for an auction of the television rights was deleted temporarily, though that could come up again in the next hearing.Frank McCourt gets his money, for now As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, McCourt's lawyer served Selig and other top MLB executives with subpoenas, in an attempt to prove that Selig had predetermined that he was going to seize the Dodgers. MLB attorneys responded that allowing McCourt access to MLB documents and executives would turn the hearing into \\"a multi-ringed side show of mini-trials on his personal disputes.\\"MLB says Frank McCourt isn't entitled to documents The Judge sided with MLB and ruled that McCourt could not compel the release of the documents or depose Selig because they weren't relevant to the issue of the bankruptcy.McCourt loses bid to force documents from MLB After a hearing on July 20, the judge rejected McCourt's further use of the Highbridge loan and ordered McCourt to negotiate a loan with MLB. On September 23, the MLB made several requests of the court, to be decided at an October 12 hearing. It asked that the judge order the Dodgers seized and sold. It also threatened to block any attempt to sell TV rights (and perhaps even suspend the team from the league for the 2012 season), and alleged that McCourt's lawyers have no standing as he and they are in violation of MLB rules. The Dodgers in a statement said that MLB was trying to force \\"an unnecessary and value-destroying distressed sale\\" of the team.Dodgers statement: MLB trying to force distressed sale On September 30, Judge Gross ruled that McCourt's lawyers could not attempt discovery by looking into the records of other MLB clubs. However, he did say he expected Selig to testify in person. He set the hearing for the MLB and McCourt's lawyers to provide case for and against the sale of the club in early November, where he would rule on various points involving McCourt, the Dodgers, MLB, and the TV contract. Sale of the Dodgers On November 1, 2011 McCourt and MLB issued a joint statement that McCourt had agreed to sell the team, the Stadium and the parking lots. The league hoped to have a new owner in place by opening day, 2012.Frank McCourt agrees to sell Dodgers Opening bids on the team were due on January 24, 2012.

LAtimes.com Retrieved on 2012-02-03. On March 27, 2012, it was announced that an agreement had been reached on the sale of the Dodgers between Frank McCourt and Guggenheim Baseball Management LLC, a group of investors fronted by Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter and including former Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson, baseball executive Stan Kasten and film mogul Peter Guber. LOS ANGELES TIMES March 27, 2012 The total sale price for the Dodgers (which includes Dodger Stadium and surrounding land) exceeded $2 billion, making the sale the largest for a professional sports team in history, exceeding the approximately $1.5 billion purchase of Manchester United F.C. by Malcolm Glazer in 2005. The sale price of the Dodgers was considered to be far higher than what the team was actually worth at the time of sale. Estimates made by Forbes placed the value of the Dodgers at approximately $1.4 billion, and the winning bid was more than 30% higher than the next highest bid. On April 13, the sale was approved by the bankruptcy court and on May 1, 2012 the sale officially closed.Dodgers sale closes; McCourt era ends  References  Los Angeles Dodgers Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute Los Angeles Dodgers ownership Major League Baseball controversies ","title":"2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute"},{"id":"31557581","title":"1985 Palauan presidential election"},{"id":"31557599","text":"Odel√≠n Molina Hern√°ndez (born 3 August 1974) is a Cuban international footballer who last played for Antiguan side Parham, as a goalkeeper.

It was little known in Berlin but widely read in the surrounding countryside and the provinces; it had a higher print run in winter than summer.de Mendelssohn, p. 116. In the initial year the print run was 60,000 copies; by 1900 it reached approximately 150,000 copies. From 1911, circulation declined and settled at 100,000. However, by 1930 it had the highest circulation in Germany.Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual 4 (1987) p. 227.

Initially it was available only in Berlin; after World War I, it was also distributed in surrounding districts. It appeared daily in Berlin, 6 days a week outside the city. The Sunday edition was 14 pages, the weekday editions 8 pages. Subscribers received a cookery book, the B√ºrgerliches Kochbuch. From 1911 to 1918, the Illustrierte Familien-Zeitung (illustrated family paper) was offered as a supplement. Also before World War I, annual yearbooks and calendars could be ordered.

Her novels have been translated into more than thirty languages internationally. Oliver is a 2012 E.B. White Read-Aloud Award nominee for her middle-grade novel Liesl & Po, as well as author of the middle-grade fantasy novel The Spindlers. Oliver graduated from the University of Chicago, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and also received a Master of Fine Arts degree from New York University. In 2010, Oliver co- founded Paper Lantern Lit, a literary ‚Äúincubator‚Äù/ development company now called Glasstown Entertainment with Razorbill editor and poet Lexa Hillyer.Sellers, John A. ‚ÄúPaper Lantern Lit Gets Into E-Publishing‚Äù Publishers Weekly.com. Retrieved 24 June 2017 Early life Growing up, Oliver was both an avid reader and writer: \\"I come from a family of writers, and so have always (mistakenly) believed that spending hours in front of the computer every day, mulling over the difference between 'chortling: and 'chuckling' is normal. As a child, after finishing a book, I would continue to write a sequel for its characters, because I did not want to have to give them up.\\" As she continued in her writing, Oliver eventually made the switch to writing her own stories and characters, with some success. However, writing was not Oliver's only passion; she also enjoyed taking ballet, drawing, painting, making collages, singing, acting, experimenting with cooking, and (as she put it), \\"(trying) to spend my time being as creative and useless as possible.\\" After finishing high school and moving on to the University of Chicago, Oliver revealed, \\"I continued to be as impractical as possible by majoring in philosophy and literature... inadvertently aided and abetted in my mission by my older sister, Lizzie, who pursued a Ph.D. in philosophy and cognitive science. This eventually led our parents to resign themselves to the fact that their children would never be lawyers, doctors, or even gainfully employed.\\" Career and novels Oliver's first book, Before I Fall, was published on March 2, 2010, by HarperCollins in the United States, and by Hodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom. The book follows Sam, a teenage girl, who has to go through the last day of her life seven times and each time learns new values and the mysteries surrounding her death. Oliver has said that she wrote all of the book on her BlackBerry while she went to meetings on the subway. She would e-mail herself the chapters to later work on them some more. Open Road Films released the film version in theatres on March 3, 2017, with Zoey Deutch portraying the main character, Samantha Kingston. Oliver's second book, Delirium, is the first in her dystopian trilogy. Oliver's first novella, Hana, was released after Delirium' and shows Hana's perspective on the events of Delirium. The trilogy's second book, Pandemonium, was released on February 28, 2012. Another novella, Annabel, was released on December 26, 2012 as an e-book and has events before those unfolding in Delirium such as details the story of Lena's mother prior to the events. The third and final book of the trilogy, Requiem, was published on March 5, 2013. A third novella, Raven, was published along with the third book, Requiem, on March 5, 2013 as an e-book and follows Raven on her life and adventures between the events of Pandemonium and Requiem. On March 5, 2013, all three of the novellas (Hana, Annabel, and Raven) were released together in a softcover book. Oliver's first middle-grade book, about a girl who is visited by a ghost who says her dead father is stuck in Limbo and that only she can help him over, was published on September 1, 2011. Her second middle-grade book, The Spindlers, tells the story of a young girl, Liza, who travels into a fantastical underworld to rescue her younger brother from the sinister creatures. The book was released on August 2, 2012. Oliver's next book, a young adult contemporary novel Panic, was released March 4, 2014 and has been already optioned by Universal Pictures in a major deal. It tells the stories of Heather and Dodge, who are recently-graduated high school students in the impoverished small town of Carp. The action revolves around the mysterious and dangerous game, \\"Panic,\\" which takes place every summer after graduation and involves a series of adrenaline pumping challenges that become progressively more life-threatening to weed out the weak and find out who is the most fearless of all. The winner receives a large sum of money (the year thst Heather and Dodge play, the prize is $67,000), which is a chance to escape the poverty in which they all live. That novel was followed by her first adult novel, Rooms, on September 23, 2014, and another teen novel, Vanishing Girls, on March 10, 2015. Vanishing Girls tells the story of two sisters, Dara and Nick, who deal with the aftermath of a disastrous car accident that has put a strain on their once-inseparable relationship. The book alternates between the perspectives of Dara and Nick until Dara disappears unexpectedly around the same time that a local 9-year old vanishes. Convinced that the two disappearances are connected, Nick decides that she must find out what happened to her sister before it is too late. The book is a psychological thriller that uses regular prose as well as multimedia elements to unfold the mystery. Oliver's third book for younger readers and the first of a new series was released on September 29, 2015. Curiosity House: The Shrunken Head is a novel written in collaboration with H.C. Chester. Oliver's next young adult book, Replica, follows the story of two girls, Gemma and Lyra and asks the reader to read the same story but from two different perspectives. Oliver's fourth and fifth bookd for younger readers were Curiosity House: The Screaming Statue and Curiosity House: The Fearsome Firebird, the second and the third of the Curiosity House series. In 2019, she became the president of Glasstown West, the company's film and TV division, and she simultaneously began work on Hookline, an aggregate platform of social AR iconography slated for launch in 2020. With Lexa Hillyer, she has authored and developed more than one hundred original books and TV/film scripts. Personal life Oliver was born in Queens and raised in Westchester, New York, a small town very similar to the one depicted in Before I Fall. She is the daughter of the true crime writer Harold Schechter. Her parents are both literature professors, and from a very young age, she was encouraged to make up stories, draw, paint, dance around in costumes, and spend much of her time essentially living imaginatively. Her love of writing began with writing imaginative sequels to her favorite stories before she gradually wrote her own. She pursued literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago and then moved back to New York to attend NYU‚Äôs MFA program in creative writing. She simultaneously began working at Penguin Books, in a young adult division called Razorbill, where, she started work on Before I Fall. She left in 2009 to pursue writing full time and now happily works at home. Oliver lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Life He was the eldest son of John Caley, a grocer in Bishopsgate Street, London. Acquaintance with Thomas Astle led to a place in the Record Office in the Tower of London. In 1787 he received from Lord William Bentinck, the Clerk of the Pipe, the keepership of the records in the Augmentation office, in place of H. Brooker; and in 1818, on the death of George Rose, he was appointed keeper of the records in the ancient treasury at Westminster. Meanwhile, he had entered Gray's Inn, on 11 January 1786, but never proceeded to the bar. When the first Record Commission was nominated in 1801, Caley was appointed secretary, an office which he continued to hold until the dissolution of the commission in March 1831. A special office, that of sub-commissioner, to superintend the arranging, repairing, and binding of records, was created for him, with a salary of ¬£500 a year, besides retaining his two keeperships. Caley died at his house in Exmouth Street, Spa Fields, on 28 April 1834, aged 71. His library, rich in topography and collections of reports and searches made by him as a legal antiquary during a period of fifty years, was sold by Evans in the following July. Several of his manuscripts were acquired by the British Museum. Works As a sub-commissioner Caley became a joint-editor in fourteen of the works undertaken by the commission. He also printed, at the request of Thomas Burgess, a few copies of the Ecclesiastical Survey of the Possessions, &c.;, of the Bishop of St. David's(1812). In 1813, he engaged, in conjunction with Bulkeley Bandinel and Sir Henry Ellis, to prepare a new edition of William Dugdale's Monasticon, which extended to six volumes, the first of which appeared in 1817, the last in 1830. He mainly furnished documents. Caley was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in March 1786, and contributed a memoir \\"On the Origin of the Jews in England\\" to the eighth volume of the Arch√¶ologia (pp. 389‚Äì405) His other contributions were: in 1789 an extract from a manuscript in the Augmentation Office relative to a wardrobe account of Henry VIII (ix. 243‚Äì52); in 1790 a valuation (temp. Henry VIII) of the shrine called Corpus Christi Shrine at York (x. 469‚Äì71); and in 1791 the \\"Survey of the Manor of Wymbledon, alias Wimbleton\\",‚Äô taken by the parliamentary commissioners in November 1649 (x. 399‚Äì448). He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society and Linnean Society, and a member of the Society of Arts. Reputation To Caley's influence were attributed many of the scandals of the Record Commission. He had critics in the arranging and binding of the records; and he also removed the seals from documents. Applicants for historical documents had to apply at Caley's private house, a costly and unreliable process. The only indexes were in Caley's possession at his house.

After being abandoned, it was incorporated it into the Downtown East Village revitalization project. History The King Edward Hotel was built in phases between 1905 and 1910 on 9th Avenue Southeast. It housed one of Calgary's oldest bars. It closed its doors in 2004. In 2012, the inside and outside of the building were scanned for historical preservation, and to assist in the design of the National Music Centre. A subset of the exterior scan can be viewed as the building existed before being dismantled in 2013. =Incorporation in National Music Centre= In May 2008, the National Music Centre was selected through a competitive process to work with Calgary Municipal Land Corporation on the King Eddy rejuvenation project. In October 2013, crews started the tedious task of taking the century-old hotel apart brick-by-brick. The bricks were wrapped and stored on pallets inside a shipping container to preserve them while crews worked to reassemble the structure. Even the hotel's front door step was saved to be used again.

Shpoonkle aimed to help its users find more affordable legal assistance. It also aimed to provide a venue where lawyers could find casework. History Shpoonkle was founded by Robert Grant Niznik, a 21-year- old third year student at New York Law School. Recent controversy and lawsuits between law school graduates and their schools support the difficulties many law school graduates are experiencing. Many young lawyers, struggling to repay student loans, could benefit from an online legal marketplace. In several interviews Niznik has referred to the decline in American legal jobs, citing a study by the Northwestern University Law School that found that since 2008 over 15,000 attorney and legal-staff jobs have been eliminated and that according to Forrester Research, about 50,000 American legal jobs will be outsourced overseas by 2015. Controversy Even before Shpoonkle was officially launched, it became the subject of controversy within the legal community. Scott Greenfield, a noted New York criminal defense lawyer, wrote about Shpoonkle in his blog, Simple Justice: \\"Any lawyer who signs up for this service should be immediately disbarred, then tarred and feathered, then publicly humiliated.\\" Susan Cartier Liebel, in her blog Solo Practice University, wrote: \\"Here you have a race to the bottom as lawyers bid against one another to pay the lowest fee to anonymous clients with legal problems.\\" And lawyer Charles Cooper wrote in his blog, NonTradLaw: \\"Why the ridiculous name?

The technique was developed in the laboratory of Jason D. Lieb at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In contrast to DNase-Seq, the FAIRE-Seq protocol doesn't require the permeabilization of cells or isolation of nuclei, and can analyse any cell type. In a study of seven diverse human cell types, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq produced strong cross-validation, with each cell type having 1-2% of the human genome as open chromatin.  Workflow  The protocol is based on the fact that the formaldehyde cross-linking is more efficient in nucleosome-bound DNA than it is in nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. This method then segregates the non cross-linked DNA that is usually found in open chromatin, which is then sequenced. The protocol consists of cross linking, phenol extraction and sequencing the DNA in aqueous phase. = FAIRE = FAIRE uses the biochemical properties of protein-bound DNA to separate nucleosome- depleted regions in the genome. Cells will be subjected to cross-linking, ensuring that the interaction between the nucleosomes and DNA are fixed. After sonication, the fragmented and fixed DNA is separated using a phenol- chloroform extraction. This method creates two phases, an organic and an aqueous phase. Due to their biochemical properties, the DNA fragments cross- linked to nucleosomes will preferentially sit in the organic phase. Nucleosome depleted or ‚Äòopen‚Äô regions on the other hand will be found in the aqueous phase. By specifically extracting the aqueous phase, only nucleosome-depleted regions will be purified and enriched. = Sequencing = FAIRE-extracted DNA fragments can be analyzed in a high-throughput way using next-generation sequencing techniques. In general, libraries are made by ligating specific adapters to the DNA fragments that allow them to cluster on a platform and be amplified resulting in the DNA sequences being read/determined, and this in parallel for millions of the DNA fragments. Depending on the size of the genome FAIRE-seq is performed on, a minimum of reads is required to create an appropriate coverage of the data, ensuring a proper signal can be determined. In addition, a reference or input genome, which has not been cross-linked, is often sequenced alongside to determine the level of background noise. Note that the extracted FAIRE-fragments can be quantified in an alternative method by using quantitative PCR. However, this method does not allow a genome wide / high-throughput quantification of the extracted fragments.  Sensitivity  There are several aspects of FAIRE-seq that require attention when analysing and interpreting the data. For one, it has been stated that FAIRE-seq will have a higher coverage at enhancer regions over promoter regions. This is in contrast to the alternative method of DNase-seq who is known to show a higher sensitivity towards promoter regions. In addition, FAIRE-seq has been stated to show prefers for internal introns and exons. In general it is also believed that FAIRE-seq data displays a higher background level, making it a less sensitive method.  Computational analysis  In a first step FAIRE-seq data are mapped to the reference genome of the model organism used. Next, the identification of genomic regions with open chromatin, is done by using a peak calling algorithm. Different tools offer packages to do this (e.g. ChIPOTle ZINBA and MACS2). ChIPOTle uses a sliding window of 300bp to identify statistically significant signals. In contrast, MACS2 identifies the enriched signal by combining the parameter callpeak with other options like 'broad', 'broad cutoff', 'no model' or 'shift'. ZINBA is a generic algorithm for detection of enrichment in short read dataset. It thus helps in the accurate detection of signal in complex datasets having low signal-to noise ratio. BedTools is used to merge the enriched regions residing close to each other to form COREs (Cluster of open regulatory elements). This helps in the identification of chromatin accessible regions and gene regulation patterns which would have been undetectable otherwise, considering the lower resolution FAIRE-seq often brings with it. Data is typically visualized as tracks (e.g. bigWig) and can be uploaded to the UCSC genome browser. The major limitation of this method, i.e. the low signal-to-noise ratio compared to other chromatin accessibility assays, makes the computational interpretation of these data very difficult.  Alternative methods  There are several methods that can be used as an alternative to FAIRE-seq. DNase-seq uses the ability of the DNase I enzyme to cleave free/open/accessible DNA to identify and sequence open chromatin. The subsequently developed ATAC-seq employs the Tn5 transposase, which inserts specified fragments or transposons into accessible regions of the genome to identify and sequence open chromatin.

Webb (25 August 1902 - 18 January 1999) was an American medical doctor and archaeologist who conducted extensive research on prehistoric sites in the southeastern United States. A pediatrician by profession, he became interested in archaeology on a camping trip with his sons where he found some small, triangular points. A distinguished physician, his archaeological research included the study of Caddoan culture, and at a number of major sites such as Poverty Point, John Pearce, Gahagan, and Belcher Mound. Background Webb was born August 25, 1902 to Frederick and Annie Lou Hungerford Webb in Shreveport, Louisiana. Growing up in a rural area, he spent his early life working on family farms in Bayou Pierre in DeSoto and Caddo Parishes. This led to a deep appreciation for the land and for hard work. In 1919 he graduated valedictorian from Shreveport High. In 1923 he received his undergraduate degree from Tulane University and then a medical degree in 1925.Gibson, Jon L. ‚ÄúArchaeological Bibliography of Clarence Hungerford Webb, 1939-1979.‚Äù Caddoan and Poverty Point archaeology: Essays in Honor of Clarence Hungerford Webb (Louisiana Archaeology 6:51-60, 1980).

Webb married Dorothy Dodd, daughter of Reverend Monroe E. Dodd, pastor of First Baptist Church, in 1926. They had two sons, Clarence, Jr. and Elmon Dodd. Career Webb practiced medicine in Texas, Minnesota, and Illinois from 1929 until 1931 when he received his Master's in Pediatrics from the University of Chicago. After receiving his Master's, Webb moved his family back to Shreveport and opened the first Well Baby clinic, in the Shreveport Public Health Department, with a friend. This clinic served the area for fifty years and Webb remained there until his retirement in 1976. He held teaching positions at four universities and served on the staff at six hospitals. By 1940, he was a charter member of the Society for American Archaeology and joined the Texas Archaeological Society where he attended annual meetings and participated in paper presentations.Louisiana Archaeological Survey and Antiques Commission. The Caddo Indiansof Louisiana. Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism. Ed. 2 (1990). Archaeology Webb's interest in archaeology did not occur until 1934 when he accompanied his sons on a Boy Scout trip near Mena, Arkansas. According to friends, this day changed his life. Webb began studying reports and techniques of well-known archaeologists such as James A. Ford. His next move was to contact Edward Neild and Michael Beckman, two Shreveport collectors who became lifelong friends of Webb. In 1935 Webb traveled to Poverty Point and uncovered a cache of about 1,500 stone vessel fragments, which was the first of many visits to the site either surface collecting or conducting excavations. Even though his first large scale excavation project was some years in the future, salvage archaeology was occurring in the south during this time under the auspices of New Deal labor relief programs. One of the sites examined was at Marksville, Louisiana where the project archaeologists, Frank Setzler, aided by James Ford, became Webb's mentors. Over the next few years, Webb worked on many sites and met well-known archaeologists like Arden R. King, Robert Stuart Neitzel, Edwin Doran, Carlyle Smith, and William Malloy. James Ford and Edwin Doran's interest in the stratigraphic occurrence of potsherds in middens probably influenced Webb's interest in cultural chronology and site descriptions, especially at Poverty Point. In the 1930s Webb met James B. Griffin, who assisted him in pottery classification. During the same time, the University of Oklahoma began its archaeological program and Webb made friends with Robert Bell, David Baerreis, and Kenneth Orr. Webb also met Alex Krieger on an excavation in Texas and the two collaborated on a number of projects over their careers. Later in the 1930s Webb began to conduct his own excavations, with field most notably at Poverty Point and the Gahagan Mounds. He conducted projects regularly over the next thirty years. During his work at Poverty Point, Webb created an extensive and well documented surface collection from the site.Webb, Clarence H. ‚ÄúEvidences of Pre-Pottery Cultures in Louisiana.‚Äù AmericanAntiquity, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Jan. 1948), pg. 227-232. Clarence Webb died January 18, 1991 in Shreveport, Louisiana, at eighty-nine years of age. Key excavations Webb did extensive archaeological work in Louisiana and adjoining areas, where the prehistory record was replete with pottery-making and mound building cultures. This was partly because northern Louisiana's fertile land was suitable for the agricultural peoples. Early in his career Webb concluded there was evidence for a fleeting Folsom-Yuma (Clovis) horizon in the state, and he later excavated the later Paleoindian San Patrice John Pearce site.Webb, Clarence H. ‚ÄúArchaic and Poverty Point Zoomorphic Locust Beads.‚Äù American Antiquity, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Jan. 1971), pg. 105-114. =‚Ä¢ Poverty Point= Poverty Point is a Late Archaic period archaeological site located in the lower Mississippi Valley in West Carroll Parish occupied from ca. 1600 to 1000 B.C. It consists of several earthwork and mounds and was created toward the end of the Archaic Period by the Native American Poverty Point culture. Webb conducted extensive work at the site, beginning in the late 1930s and continuing throughout the remainder of his life, writing many papers and generating extensive surface collections of the Late Archaic and Tchefuncte assemblages.Webb, Clarence H. ‚ÄúThe Belcher Mound: A Stratified Caddoan Site in CaddoParish, Louisiana.‚Äù Memoirs of the Study for Archaeology, Vol. 16 (1959), pg.1-212. Webb's work shed light on the site, which had received minimal study prior to this due to an absence of major ceramic period occupations. He found zoomorphic locust beads at the site that were made from carved and polished stone, usually red jasper. The beads resembled grasshoppers and cyclical cicadas. He proposed that the beads involved an element of magic that spread across the southern states in multicultural contexts. He argued there was no evidence for cultural unity among the sites where the zoomorphic beads appeared. =‚Ä¢ Belcher Mound= Because he lived in Shreveport, Webb had long known about the Caddo culture. Located in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Belcher Mound was excavated by Webb along with some friends and volunteers over five years on weekends. The team spent nearly a decade on the excavation and reporting on this mound. Webb concluded the site represented the ceremonial and possible civil center of a small agricultural community located in the Red River Valley. It was part of the Caddoan culture, people who were primarily farmers, but also fished, hunted, and gathered. They built mounds which were used for ceremonies and contained burials. He noted major changes in house types, construction and usage, pottery, burial customs, some of the tools, ornamentation, and ceremonial tools and customs. They may have hunted using the bow and arrow with small stone points, used small triangular scrapers to scrape hides, and bone tools and ornaments were preferred over shell. Burials were found with ornaments that suggested hereditary social ranking.Webb, Clarence H. ‚ÄúThe Caddo Indians of Louisiana.‚Äù Louisiana Archaeological Survey and Antiques Commission, Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism. Ed. 2 (1990). The center of Caddoan occupation during contact times and throughout their prehistoric development was along Red River, with extensions to other river valleys in the four state area of northern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, eastern Texas, and eastern Oklahoma. They maintained trade and cultural contacts with the lower Mississippi Valley tribes of eastern and southern Louisiana for many centuries. Other excavations Other than Poverty Point and Belcher Mounds, Webb initiated or completed excavations at the Gahagan site, the Mounds Plantation site, and the Bellevue Mound between 1935 and 1945. He also conducted excavations and a number of smaller Caddoan sites along the Red River and its tributaries. Webb also did work on the San Patrice Culture in the Southeast. Around and slightly before 8,000 B.C., artifacts of the Dalton and San Patrice cultures were common in the Southeast. There was speculation that the ancient ancestors of the Caddo-speaking peoples came from among the San Patrice rather than Dalton peoples, based on the geographic distribution of these early points. These cultures are considered by many archeologists to be among the first of many Archaic cultures in the Southeastern United States.http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/first.html Webb conducted excavations at the John Pearce site with Joel Shiner and Wayne Roberts, which further defined the lithic assemblages found at this San Patrice culture site. It is still to be determined whether or not these points represent separate Clovis and San Patrice components. Webb further defined the San Patrice assemblages as a socio-cultural unit that was similar to Plains Paleoindian, but transitional to Early Archaic.Rees, Mark A. ‚ÄúPaleoindian and Early Archaic.‚Äù Archaeology of Louisiana, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. December 2010. Pg. 49 and 59. Awards and contributions Webb received numerous awards during his archaeological and medical careers: *1960: honorary LL. D. degree from Centenary College of Shreveport. *1962: President of American Academy of Pediatrics. *1965: Grulee Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics. *1977: first James R. Ford Award for ‚Äúoutstanding contributions in Louisiana archaeology.‚Äù *1985: first Crabtree Award from the Society of American Archaeology. (This award represents the highest distinction to persons without formal archaeological training who made major contributions to the field). *1987: for his numerous accomplishments, the Daughters of the American Revolution chose him as one of the ‚ÄúOutstanding Men in America.‚Äù Webb made many contributions to many different societies and charities. He organized the first Caddo Conference in 1942 which continues to meet for the study of Caddo culture. His contributions to the understanding of Poverty Point through the early 1980s allowed him to play a major role in the federal and state recognition of the site. He also served on the city of Shreveport commission that wrote the present city charter. A distinguished medical doctor, he was a member of eleven medical societies and held officer positions in most of them. The Louisiana State University Medical School created an award, in his name, for the Outstanding Clinical Instructor of the Year. Selected publications *1. The Caddo Indians of Louisiana.

Conclusion When the Louisiana state archaeological society was reactivated in 1970, Webb was chosen as its first president because of his previous contributions to the archaeological societies of Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. In 1974 in Louisiana, an office for State Archaeologist was established and Webb was the first to be asked to serve on its Archaeological Survey and Antiquities Commission. He served as chairman until his death in 1991.

The games feature different genres and settings, and were developed by the Japanese and Canadian branches of Capcom. Resident Evil: The Missions Resident Evil: The Missions, known as Biohazard: The Missions in Japan, is a survival horror game developed by Capcom. It is designed to be a series of short challenges which can be completed in a matter of minutes, and does not attempt to provide a new storyline. There is also an enhanced 3D version of the title. In The Missions, players primarily control Jill Valentine, although other characters can be unlocked through continued play.IGN: Resident Evil: The Missions Review The game recycles prerendered backgrounds from several of the PlayStation era for its backdrops. The game features 150 different missions. Although some of the missions have the same objective no two missions are exactly alike. Objectives vary from killing enemies in a certain manner, killing enemies with a limited arsenal, getting to a location within the given time or fighting enemies in the dark. There are also several unlockables, such as several new costumes, gallery images, weapons, or extra equipment such as light weight boots that increase movement speed, a laser sight that improves aiming, a customising pack that gives each weapon a unique ability or a side pack that gives the ability to carry two extra normal items. The player controls Jill Valentine. When aiming specifically for an enemy's head or legs a small targeting reticule appears in front of the target and expands and contracts rhythmically. When the aim is as small as possible the chance of hitting the targeted area is greater. At the end of each mission a score is determined by time, kills, damage or a combination of the three along with item usage. Resident Evil: Confidential Report Resident Evil: Confidential Report is a turn-based strategy game series by Capcom originally released in 2004. The series contains four titles (File 1-4). Confidential Report is markedly different from its predecessors. It uses turn-based movement and grid system- based combat. Like Resident Evil 2, each game features two scenarios with two different characters. =Plot= Rookie cop 'Leon S Kennedy has been assigned to guard the Umbrella Storage Facility in Raccoon City when an explosion from underground rocks the foundations. Tyler is knocked down, and trapped inside the Storage Facility, however as he wakes up he notices hoards of the undead coming towards him. Meanwhile, FBI Agent, Naomi McClain has been sent into the city to investigate the experiments of this facility, and locate what the previous agent could not; concrete evidence direct from secret FBI informants working within Umbrella's ranks. After surviving the horrors of the infested Storage Facility, Tyler has been holding up in a local police station. Suddenly, the distress alarm rings from Raccoon University. Governed by his sense of duty, Tyler bravely sets off to the university believing there to be survivors. Unknown to Tyler, Naomi also picks up the distress call, and realises that there is a strong possibility that the alarm was raised by one of the informants she is looking for. She sets off to the university to find more clues to Umbrella and rescue this vital person. Resident Evil: Genesis Resident Evil: Genesis is a puzzle adventure game developed by Capcom Interactive Canada released on March 5, 2008. In Genesis, players are taken back to the origins of the Resident Evil franchise, taking the role of Jill Valentine as she investigates the disappearance of the STARS Bravo team and uncovers the secrets hidden in the mansion of Oswell E. Spencer. Genesis was developed from the ground up as a mobile phone title and designed to work more effectively with the limited control scheme and screen size. The result is a game that is more of a puzzle adventure game than the survival horror titles found in console versions. The game scored 7.8 of 10 points on IGN and an 'A' on 1UP.com.Resident Evil: Genesis Review www.ign.com, January 18, 2008, Retrieved April 26, 2008Resident Evil: Genesis Review www.1up.com, January 15, 2008, Retrieved May 12, 2008  Resident Evil: Mercenaries Vs.  Resident Evil: Mercenaries Vs. is a multiplayer iOS game. It has three characters to choose from: Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, and Jill Valentine. All characters are present in the attire worn in Resident Evil 5. There are initially three maps to choose from which are entitled, \\"Dock\\", \\"Fort\\", and \\"Castle\\". All these have been taken from Resident Evil 4 and feature many of the Plagas infected Ganado and the chainsaw Ganado. Like many of the new generation mercenaries games, players are encouraged to score as many points as possible by killing B.O.W's. Combo hits can increase the timer for a player in that stage thereby allowing him to score even more points. Mercenaries Vs. supports 2 vs 2 online team match which is free to play for all via Wi-Fi. 1 vs 1 team is Free for all via Bluetooth and Single player Training and Coin Shooter mode. As this is a \\"Vs\\" title, players can take out other human controlled AI. Mercenaries Vs. will only run on more up to date versions of Apple's iOS. It will work on iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad, iPod touch 4th, iPod touch 3rd 16GB and 32GB, or better. It is not compatible with the iPhone 3G, iPod touch 1st, 2nd, 3rd 8GB.  Resident Evil: Degeneration  Resident Evil: Degeneration is the first Resident Evil game to be released based on supplementary material and the first game on Nokia N Gage 2.0 system and iPhone platform. Resident Evil: Degeneration is based on the CGI film of the same name, and incorporates many aspects seen from the film. With the same 3D engine used in Resident Evil 4 Mobile Edition, the Nokia version of Degeneration plays very much like an extension of the same formula, set in Harvardville Airport. The game boasts the best looking graphics for any Resident Evil cellphone game with a fully 3D environment for Leon S. Kennedy to explore.'The iPhone version of the game is divided into 10 small chapters, with Leon completing simple objectives whilst battling the undead. As opposed to the CGI film, much more time is spent in the airport with the ultimate goal being to prevent infected planes from taking to the air on their auto-pilot systems. Degeneration was a major project and one of the flagship triple A titles for the relaunched N-Gage platform.  Resident Evil Assault The Nightmare  Resident Evil Assault The Nightmare is a cell phone game developed by LivingMobile with a graphical look reminiscent of anime in a first person action shooter. Assault the Nightmare runs as a first person shooter, with players using the arrow keys on their phone to aim the gun in front of them at the oncoming hoards of undead. The graphical design is an anime style. Zombies look very cartoony with thick black outlines, and the civilians resemble anime characters. An emergency at a castle outside a city horrible things are happening and the player is requested to go there.  Resident Evil Zombie Buster  Resident Evil Zombie Buster was an early foray into the ever-growing mobile phone games industry. Using familiar characters and creatures from the Resident Evil universe. The player can choose between Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield, who are faced with the task of defending a line which zombies are going to try and breach. Other B.O.W.s do make an appearance in this quirky overhead view shoot 'em up.  Resident Evil Uprising  Resident Evil Uprising is the direct sequel to Resident Evil Genesis; the alternate take on some of the series most memorable moments. Like Genesis, the game is divided into isometric squares, akin to the Confidential Report series, but this time the setting is the RPD with Resident Evil 2 heroine, Claire Redfield. Looking for her lost brother, Chris Redfield, Claire arrives in Raccoon City to find the city overrun with the undead and other monstrosities. Initially seeking refuge in the R.P.D, Claire and Leon must battle out of the building in order to escape the horrors that lurk in every room.  Resident Evil Outbreak Survive  Outbreak Survive is developed for mobile phones on the Japanese social networking service; FREE. It was officially announced on April 18, 2011.

Surface filters normally affect any phonetic combination that is not permitted according to the language's phonetic rules and so preserve the phonotactics of that language. They are also often a source of complementary distribution between certain sets of sounds. A trivial example of a surface filter is the replacement of sounds foreign to a language with sounds native to the language. For example, a language that has no front rounded vowels may replace such vowels with either front unrounded or back rounded vowels, whenever it borrows a word containing such a vowel. Strictly speaking, that is not a surface filter, as it is merely the way in which the phonetics of one language are matched to that of another. That example, however, still illustrates the importance of surface filters in preserving the phonological structure of words within the language. Usually, the term applies only to rules that affect both native and borrowed words. Examples One very common example of a surface filter is final-obstruent devoicing in which a voiced obstruent at the end of a word is automatically converted to their unvoiced counterpart. If that were a regular sound change, the devoicing would occur only at a particular point in time, and any new words that entered the language later might end in voiced obstruents. However, new words are automatically \\"passed through the filter\\" like earlier words, and their final obstruents are devoiced automatically. That happens even if there is apocope of final vowels, with non-final obstruents becoming final. A historical example in Dutch occurs in many verbs, such as blazen (\\"to blow\\"). The original Middle Dutch first-person singular present form was blaze, but when the final -e was lost, the form did not become *blaaz (the doubled vowel is only a spelling convention), but the -z was automatically devoiced to create the modern form, blaas. Two other examples of surface filters in the history of the Germanic languages were Sievers' law and the Germanic spirant law. Sievers' law caused a restriction on the distribution between -j- and -ij-. The former appeared after a consonant following a short vowel, and the latter otherwise occurred. The process was automatic and affected even new words and loanwords: the Latin word puteus (\\"pit, well\\"), for example, was borrowed into Germanic as the two- syllable *putjaz. The more-faithful rendering *putijaz was not permitted since the short vowel u was followed by a single consonant t. The Germanic spirant law affected combinations of an obstruent that was followed by -t-. Such obstruents were automatically converted into fricatives, with dentals becoming -s-, and devoiced. For example, the Latin word scriptum (\\"writing\\") was borrowed into Germanic as *skriftiz. The forbidden combination -pt- was replaced by -ft-. Application Surface filters are often formed as a result of sound changes that change the phonetic makeup, and certain sounds or combinations no longer occur in the language. As a consequence, speakers no longer learn to pronounce such combinations and so have difficulty with new words that violate the principles. Then, either the phonology of the language is extended to incorporate such new combinations, or the \\"inconvenient\\" combinations are automatically reconstructed into a form that conforms to the phonotactics of the language. If the reconstruction occurs systematically and becomes part of the phonology of the language, the result is a surface filter. Such phonological rules may continue to apply for an indefinite amount of time. Final-obstruent devoicing in Dutch, for example, has been a phonological rule since Old Dutch, over 1000 years ago. The Germanic spirant law may have been formed as part of Grimm's law long before written records began, but it ceased to operate shortly after the Germanic languages began to separate, around the middle of the 1st millennium AD. Sometimes, sound changes occur that directly violate a surface filter, which may cause it to cease operating. Sievers' law presumably lost relevance in the West Germanic languages after the operation of the West Germanic gemination since it eliminated the contrast between light and heavy syllables, at the core of the law's operation.

Perhaps the most important generalization is that of quasi-Frobenius rings (QF rings), which are in turn generalized by right pseudo-Frobenius rings (PF rings) and right finitely pseudo-Frobenius rings (FPF rings). Other diverse generalizations of quasi-Frobenius rings include QF-1, QF-2 and QF-3 rings. These types of rings can be viewed as descendants of algebras examined by Georg Frobenius. A partial list of pioneers in quasi-Frobenius rings includes R. Brauer, K. Morita, T. Nakayama, C. J. Nesbitt, and R. M. Thrall. Definitions A ring R is quasi-Frobenius if and only if R satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: # R is Noetherian on one side and self- injective on one side. # R is Artinian on a side and self-injective on a side. # All right (or all left) R modules which are projective are also injective. # All right (or all left) R modules which are injective are also projective. A Frobenius ring R is one satisfying any of the following equivalent conditions. Let J=J(R) be the Jacobson radical of R. # R is quasi-Frobenius and the socle mathrm{soc}(R_R)cong R/J as right R modules. #R is quasi-Frobenius and mathrm{soc}(_R R)cong R/J as left R modules. # As right R modules mathrm{soc}(R_R)cong R/J, and as left R modules mathrm{soc}(_R R)cong R/J. For a commutative ring R, the following are equivalent: # R is Frobenius # R is quasi-Frobenius # R is a finite direct sum of local artinian rings which have unique minimal ideals. (Such rings are examples of \\"zero-dimensional Gorenstein local rings\\".) A ring R is right pseudo-Frobenius if any of the following equivalent conditions are met: # Every faithful right R module is a generator for the category of right R modules. # R is right self-injective and is a cogenerator of Mod-R. # R is right self-injective and is finitely cogenerated as a right R module. # R is right self-injective and a right Kasch ring. # R is right self-injective, semilocal and the socle soc(RR) is an essential submodule of R. # R is a cogenerator of Mod-R and is a left Kasch ring. A ring R is right finitely pseudo-Frobenius if and only if every finitely generated faithful right R module is a generator of Mod-R. Thrall's QF-1,2,3 generalizations In the seminal article , R. M. Thrall focused on three specific properties of (finite-dimensional) QF algebras and studied them in isolation. With additional assumptions, these definitions can also be used to generalize QF rings. A few other mathematicians pioneering these generalizations included K. Morita and H. Tachikawa. Following , let R be a left or right Artinian ring: *R is QF-1 if all faithful left modules and faithful right modules are balanced modules. *R is QF-2 if each indecomposable projective right module and each indecomposable projective left module has a unique minimal submodule. (I.e. they have simple socles.) *R is QF-3 if the injective hulls E(RR) and E(RR) are both projective modules. The numbering scheme does not necessarily outline a hierarchy. Under more lax conditions, these three classes of rings may not contain each other. Under the assumption that R is left or right Artinian however, QF-2 rings are QF-3. There is even an example of a QF-1 and QF-3 ring which is not QF-2. Examples *Every Frobenius k algebra is a Frobenius ring. *Every semisimple ring is quasi- Frobenius, since all modules are projective and injective. Even more is true however: semisimple rings are all Frobenius. This is easily verified by the definition, since for semisimple rings mathrm{soc}(R_R)=mathrm{soc}(_R R)=R and J = rad(R) = 0. *The quotient ring frac{ mathbb{Z} }{ n mathbb{Z} } is QF for any positive integer n>1. *Commutative Artinian serial rings are all Frobenius, and in fact have the additional property that every quotient ring R/I is also Frobenius. It turns out that among commutative Artinian rings, the serial rings are exactly the rings whose (nonzero) quotients are all Frobenius. *Many exotic PF and FPF rings can be found as examples in See also *Quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra Notes The definitions for QF, PF and FPF are easily seen to be categorical properties, and so they are preserved by Morita equivalence, however being a Frobenius ring is not preserved. For one- sided Noetherian rings the conditions of left or right PF both coincide with QF, but FPF rings are still distinct. A finite-dimensional algebra R over a field k is a Frobenius k-algebra if and only if R is a Frobenius ring. QF rings have the property that all of their modules can be embedded in a free R module. This can be seen in the following way. A module M embeds into its injective hull E(M), which is now also projective. As a projective module, E(M) is a summand of a free module F, and so E(M) embeds in F with the inclusion map. By composing these two maps, M is embedded in F.

In Earth science, as opposed to Materials Science, Ductility refers to the capacity of a rock to deform to large strains without macroscopic fracturing. Such behavior may occur in unlithified or poorly lithified sediments, in weak materials such as halite or at greater depths in all rock types where higher temperatures promote crystal plasticity and higher confining pressures suppress brittle fracture. In addition, when a material is behaving ductilely, it exhibits a linear stress vs strain relationship past the elastic limit. Ductile deformation is typically characterized by diffuse deformation (i.e. lacking a discrete fault plane) and on a stress-strain plot is accompanied by steady state sliding at failure, compared to the sharp stress drop observed in experiments during brittle failure. Brittle-Ductile Transition Zone The brittle-ductile transition zone is characterized by a change in rock failure mode, at an approximate average depth of 10‚Äì15 km (~ 6.2‚Äì9.3 miles) in continental crust, below which rock becomes less likely to fracture and more likely to deform ductilely. The zone exists because as depth increases confining pressure increases, and brittle strength increases with confining pressure whilst ductile strength decreases with increasing temperature. The transition zone occurs at the point where brittle strength equals ductile strength. In glacial ice this zone is at approximately depth. Not all materials, however, abide by this transition. It is possible and not rare for material above the transition zone to deform ductilely, and for material below to deform in a brittle manner. The depth of the material does exert an influence on the mode of deformation, but other substances, such as loose soils in the upper crust, malleable rocks, biological debris, and more are just a few examples of that which does not deform in accordance to the transition zone. Fig. 1.1 ‚Äì A generalized diagram of the deformation mechanisms and structural formations that dominate at certain depths within the Earth's crust. The type of dominating deformation process also has a great impact on the types of rocks and structures found at certain depths within the Earth's crust. As evident from Fig. 1.1, different geological formations and rocks are found in accordance to the dominant deformation process. Gouge and Breccia form in the uppermost, brittle regime while Cataclasite and Pseudotachylite form in the lower parts of the brittle regime, edging upon the transition zone. Mylonite forms in the more ductile regime at greater depths while Blastomylonite forms well past the transition zone and well into the ductile regime, even deeper into the crust.  Quantification  Ductility is a material property that can be expressed in a variety of ways. Mathematically, it is commonly expressed as a total quantity of elongation or a total quantity of the change in cross sectional area of a specific rock until macroscopic brittle behavior, such as fracturing, is observed. For accurate measurement, this must be done under several controlled conditions, including but not limited to Pressure, Temperature, Moisture Content, Sample Size, etc., for all can impact the measured ductility. It is important to understand that even the same type of rock or mineral may exhibit different behavior and degrees of ductility due to internal heterogeneities small scale differences between each individual sample. The two quantities are expressed in the form of a ratio or a percent. % Elongation of a Rock = %Delta l = frac{l_f-l_i}{l_i}times100 Where: l_i = Initial Length of Rock l_f = Final Length of Rock % Change in Area of a Rock = %Delta A = frac{A_f- A_i}{A_i}times100 Where: A_i = Initial Area A_f = Final Area For each of these methods of quantifying, one must take measurements of both the initial and final dimensions of the rock sample. For Elongation, the measurement is a uni-dimensional initial and final length, the former measured before any Stress is applied and the latter measuring the length of the sample after fracture occurs. For Area, it is strongly preferable to use a rock that has been cut into a cylindrical shape before stress application so that the cross- sectional area of the sample can be taken. Cross-Sectional Area of a Cylinder = Area of a Circle = A = pi r^2 Using this, the initial and final areas of the sample can be used to quantify the % change in the area of the rock. Fig. 1.2 ‚Äì Stress vs Strain Curve displaying both ductile and brittle deformation behavior.  Deformation  Any material is shown to be able to deform ductilely or brittlely, in which the type of deformation is governed by both the external conditions around the rock and the internal conditions sample. External conditions include temperature, confining pressure, presence of fluids, etc. while internal conditions include the arrangement of the crystal lattice, the chemical composition of the rock sample, the grain size of the material, etc. Ductilely Deformative behavior can be grouped into three categories: Elastic, Viscous, and Crystal-Plastic Deformation. _Elastic Deformation_ Elastic Deformation is deformation which exhibits a linear stress-strain relationship (quantified by Young's Modulus) and is derived from Hooke's Law of spring forces (see Fig. 1.2). In elastic deformation, objects show no permanent deformation after the stress has been removed from the system and return to their original state. sigma = E epsilon Where: sigma = Stress (In Pascals) E = Young's Modulus (In Pascals) epsilon = Strain (Unitless) _Viscous Deformation_ Viscous Deformation is when rocks behave and deform more like a fluid than a solid. This often occurs under great amounts of pressure and at very high temperatures. In viscous deformation, stress is proportional to the strain rate, and each rock sample has its own material property called its Viscosity. Unlike elastic deformation, viscous deformation is permanent even after the stress has been removed. sigma = etaxi Where: sigma = Stress (In Pascals) eta = Viscosity (In Pascals * Seconds) xi = Strain Rate (In 1/Seconds) _Crystal-Plastic Deformation_ Crystal-Plastic Deformation occurs at the atomic scale and is governed by its own set of specific mechanisms that deform crystals by the movements of atoms and atomic planes through the crystal lattice. Like viscous deformation, it is also a permanent form of deformation. Mechanisms of crystal-plastic deformation include Pressure solution, Dislocation creep, and Diffusion creep.  Biological materials  In addition to rocks, biological materials such as wood, lumber, bone, etc. can be assessed for their ductility as well, for many behave in the same manner and possess the same characteristics as abiotic Earth materials. This assessment was done in Hiroshi Yoshihara's experiment, \\"Plasticity Analysis of the Strain in the Tangential Direction of Solid Wood Subjected to Compression Load in the Longitudinal Direction.\\" The study aimed to analyze the behavioral rheology of 2 wood specimens, the Sitka Spruce and Japanese Birch. In the past, it was shown that solid wood, when subjected to compressional stresses, initially has a linear stress-strain diagram (indicative of elastic deformation) and later, under greater load, demonstrates a non-linear diagram indicative of ductile objects. To analyze the rheology, the stress was restricted to uniaxial compression in the longitudinal direction and the post-linear behavior was analyzed using plasticity theory. Controls included moisture content in the lumber, lack of defects such as knots or grain distortions, temperature at 20 C, relative humidity at 65%, and size of the cut shapes of the wood samples. Results obtained from the experiment exhibited a linear stress-strain relationship during elastic deformation but also an unexpected non-linear relationship between stress and strain for the lumber after the elastic limit was reached, deviating from the model of plasticity theory. Multiple reasons were suggested as to why this came about. First, since wood is a biological material, it was suggested that under great stress in the experiment, the crushing of cells within the sample could have been a cause for deviation from perfectly plastic behavior. With greater destruction of cellular material, the stress-strain relationship is hypothesized to become more and more nonlinear and non-ideal with greater stress. Additionally, because the samples were inhomogeneous (non-uniform) materials, it was assumed that some bending or distortion may have occurred in the samples that could have deviated the stress from being perfectly uniaxial. This may have also been induced by other factors like irregularities in the cellular density profile and distorted sample cutting. The conclusions of the research accurately showed that although biological materials can behave like rocks undergoing deformation, there are many other factors and variables that must be considered, making it difficult to standardize the ductility and material properties of a biological substance.  Peak Ductility Demand  Peak Ductility Demand is a quantity used particularly in the fields of architecture, geological engineering, and mechanical engineering. It is defined as the amount of ductile deformation a material must be able to withstand (when exposed to a stress) without brittle fracture or failure. This quantity is particularly useful in the analysis of failure of structures in response to earthquakes and seismic waves. It has been shown that earthquake aftershocks can increase the peak ductility demand with respect to the mainshocks by up to 10%.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82312 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Swift in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Design and construction details Point Swift was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Swift included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After delivery in 1961, Point Swift was assigned a homeport of St. Petersburg, Florida, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 22 June 1965 she provided firefighting assistance to the burning Irish MV Irish Poplar. On 11 September 1965 she assisted in the tow of disabled FV Carousel west of Tampa, Florida. Point Swift escorted the distressed FV Mistress to Clearwater, Florida on 19 November 1967. On 7 January 1968 she escorted the distressed Liberian MV Pochteca to Tampa Bay. On 21 September 1968, she rescued three from the pleasure craft Blue Star 30 miles south of Anclote Key, Florida. On 12 November she rescued two and salvaged equipment from MV Mystery II 40 miles west of St. Petersburg.Scheina, p 77 From 1969 to 1994 she was homeported at Clearwater Beach, Florida. On 4 February 1970, she stood by anchored barges that had been released by a tug due to steering problems. On 31 May 1987, Point Swift towed one of her sister ships, the disabled cutter 80 miles west of St. Petersburg to that port.Scheina, p 77 On 30 March 1995 Point Swift was decommissioned and stored at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland.

BBC News describes him as a key member of the 8888 Generation movement. Background and role in 1988 protests Htay Kywe was the third son of U Kywe and Mi Mi Lay of Yangon; he went on to study geology at the University of Yangon. In 1988, his second year at the university, he became an early organizer in the widespread protests against military ruler Ne Win. On 16 March, he helped organize what the democracy movement would later name the \\"Red Bridge protest,\\" during which riot police allegedly killed more than 100 protesters. On 22 March, he and his brother Win Kywe were arrested for their role and detained in Insein Prison until July. These protests culminated in a general strike which began on 8 August, giving the \\"8888 Uprising\\" its name. Htay Kywe acted as a spokesman for the movement, giving an interview to BBC News. Following the military coup by Saw Maung's State Law and Order Restoration Council, Htay Kywe was one of the student delegates to meet with the general to seek reconciliation. Post-election arrests In May 1990, Burma held its first multi-party elections since 1960, with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning 392 of 492 available seats.Eur (2002). Far East and Australasia 2003. Routledge. pp. 863. . However, the military annulled the results and soon arrested a number of opposition figures, among them Htay Kywe, who was arrested at his home in Yangon on July 1991. On December 30, 1991, he received a fifteen-year prison term, and he remained jailed until 2004. After his release, he remained active in the pro-democracy movement, co- founding the 88 Generation Students Group. In September 2006, he was detained along with fellow 88 Generation Students Group members Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho and Min Zeya, in advance of Burma's 2006 national convention. In January 2007, they were released, without official explanation for either their original arrest or their sudden release. Role in 2007 anti-government protests and arrest Monks protesting in Yangon, carrying the Buddhist flag When rising fuel and commodity prices led to widespread unrest in Yangon in August 2007, the 88 Generation Students Group played a major role in organizing protests. The largest of these rallies drew over one hundred thousand protesters, most notably a number of Buddhist monks, giving the uprising the popular nickname \\"The Saffron Revolution\\" for the color of their robes. Following a government crackdown on protestors, members of the 88 Generation Students Group were swiftly arrested. Htay Kywe was among the last to be captured, leading the New York Times to describe him as Burma's \\"most- wanted man\\". Security forces posted his photograph in hotels, raided homes, and searched buses for him at checkpoints. He was finally arrested on 13 October 2007 when he emerged from hiding to visit his mother, who was suffering from cancer; when she died a month later, he was not allowed to attend her funeral. Trial and imprisonment On 11 November 2008, Htay Kywe and thirteen other activists were convicted of four counts of \\"illegally using electronic media\\" and one count of \\"forming an illegal organization\\", for a total sentence of 65 years in prison. Other charges against Htay Kwe are still pending. The Burmese government further accused Htay Kywe of being influenced by foreign powers, alleging that a private American group had delivered him $30,000 the previous year. Htay Kywe is serving his sentence in Buthitaung Prison in Rakhine State. In August 2010, he issued a statement through family members protesting the upcoming 2010 general election, stating that it would be \\"insignificant without the participation of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\\" His brother-in-law reported that Htay Kywe had lost weight in confinement and was spending his prison term reading, meditating, and studying economics. He is often kept in solitary confinement. International response Htay Kywe's repeated arrests were condemned by numerous human rights organizations. Amnesty International considered him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. Human Rights Watch called for him to be exonerated and freed, as did Front Line. The US State Department protested Htay Kywe's arrest, and British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declared that \\"this Government will not rest until Htay Kywe and other political prisoners like him are free.\\" United Nations Special Rapporteur Paulo S√©rgio Pinheiro also called for the activist's release. Release Htay Kywe was released on 13 January 2012 in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners.

During the eleven years that he spent at Stonyhurst, Father Charles Plowden was his spiritual director, and took an interest in his literary studies. He was promoted to holy orders at Durham by Bishop William Gibson, in May 1806. In October 1807, he was sent to the mission of the Society of Jesus at St. Nicholas, Exeter, as successor to Father Thomas Lewis. This mission he served for forty-four years, retiring from active duty on 6 October 1851. He continued, however, to reside in the priory, and occupied the same room till the day of his death. Oliver was one of the last Catholic priests, pupils of the English Jesuits, who did not enter the Society, but remained in the service of the English province, and subject to its superiors. On 30 March 1843 he was elected an honorary member of the Historical Society of Boston, US, and on 15 September 1844 he was created D.D. by Pope Gregory XVI.

A lithographed portrait of Oliver was published shortly after his death by George G. Palmer of Exeter. This was reproduced as a frontispiece to Thomas Nadauld Brushfield's 'Bibliography.'

It is situated in the central part of North Zealand (the northeastern region of Zealand), straddling the boundaries of the municipalities Hiller√∏d, Fredensborg, Helsing√∏r and Gribskov, some 40 kilometres north of Copenhagen. The lake covers 17 km2, Its length from north to south is 8.4 km and its maximum depth is 22 m. Its principal drainage is Esrum √Ö, a 10-km stream which passes Esrum Watermill and the remains of Esrum Abbey on its way to the Kattegat at Dronningm√∏lle. The western shore of the lake is dominated by Gribskov, one of Denmark's largest forests, and the small town of N√∏debo. Fredensborg Palace, one of the official residences of the Danish Royal Family, with its extensive gardens, is situated on the southeast shore. Boat trips operate on the lake from S√∏rup, a village just south of the palace gardens. History =Commercial fishing= Like many of the surrounding forests, Lake Esrum was originally a royal domain. It was first administrated by Tentekammeret and later by Frederiksborg Amtsstue on behalf of the Danish government. Fishing in the lake was entrusted with a fishing master (Danish: fiskemester) who resided at Fiskerg√•rden, located next to Slotsm√∏llen at Slotss√∏en in Hiller√∏d. From 1864, fishing was carried out by private citizens and from 1907, fishing rights were sold at auction. Commercial fishing continued until 1989. =Esrum canal= V√¶ltningen as seen on a watercolour byO.J. Rawert from 1820 Transportation of firewood along the western shore of Lake Esrum in about 1830 From the beginning of the 19th century, Lake Esrum played a role in the transport of firewood from Grib Forest to Copenhagen. From 1802 to 1805, a canal was constructed between the north end of the lake and Dronningm√∏lle. Here firewood was loaded onto large cargo ships and sailed to Copenhagen. The canal was 9 km long, 9 m wide and 1.5 m deep. The work was led by Adolph von der Recke and carried out by local peasants, soldiers and forced labour workers. A towpath ran on the banks of the canal and on the western shores of lake Esrum. The timber had to pass a 4-metre crater-like ramp called V√¶ltningen, which connected the upper section of the canal to its lower part. The upper part of the canal passed two ponds. One of them, Storedam (Great Pond), was the site of a watermill which was first used as backup for the gunpowder mill in Frederiksv√¶rk during the English Wars and later for the manufacturing of textiles for the army. Transportation of firewood on the canal continued until 1874 and it was later used for leisure trips. It has now dried out and been covered by forest, but V√¶ltningen and other elements are still visible in the landscape. S√∏rup in 1876, painting by Hans Ole Brasen =S√∏rup's washhouses= From the middle of the 19th century, the small village of S√∏rup on the southeastern shores of the lake was home to numerous laundries. The laundry was picked up at institutions and wealthy households in Copenhagen, Hiller√∏d and Elsinore. When the industry peaked, S√∏rup was home to 20 laundries with some one hundred employees.  Hydrology  The water quality of lake Esrum is considered good. Since 2002, there have been a few incidences of trematoda plaguing swimmers in the summertime every year. The trematodes are a natural part of lake Esrums' aquatic life. Ecology Lake Esrum have a large population of European perch and Northern pike. Other species includes European eel, ruffe, bream, roach, tench and bleak. A smaller population of brown trout is living here, having adapted to the freshwater. The professional fishing for eel, was previously substantial, but in 1997 the annual catch had fallen to 388 kg from a mere 14 tons. Nowadays, the lake is exclusively fished by anglers. The birdlife at the lake is varied. The common goldeneye was formerly a rare breeding bird in Denmark, but after a determined effort involving artificial nests, the species is almost a signature of lake Esrum. Other common birds here includes Eurasian coot, mallard, tufted duck, great crested grebe and mute swan. The reed beds along the lake brinks, hold many swan nests and in the southern end, a colony of the great cormorant have found a home, with several hundreds of nests.  Protections  Lake Esrum is part of a larger 7,400 ha Natura 2000 area, comprising Gribskov and a few smaller woodlands nearby.133 Gribskov, Esrum S√∏, Esrum √Ö and Sn√¶vret Skov Danish Nature agency It is included in the Kongernes Nordsj√¶lland National Park.  Recreation  \\"Esrum S√∏ B√•dfart\\" (Lake Esrum Boat Service) operates boat trips on the lake from Chaluphuset, a former royal boathouse located at S√∏rup on the south side of Fredensborg Palace gardens. Chaluphuset is also used as a venue from special events. Esrum S√∏ B√•dfart also operates a caf√© in Fendrikshus, a former forest worker's house in Gribskov on the other side of the lake. The caf√© is open Friday-Sunday and can be reached by boat or on foot or bicycle through the forest. Skipperhuset, Chaluphuset's next door neighbour, is a lunch restaurant overlooking the lake.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord- Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in King's County (County Offaly) unless stated otherwise.

After reading \\"Timothy's Birthday\\" by William Trevor and \\"The Moor\\" by Russell Banks, Murakami felt haunted and decided to collect more birthday-themed stories for an anthology. Murakami was putting together Birthday Stories (2002 in Japanese, 2004 in English), his anthology of short stories on the theme of birthdays, and wrote \\"Birthday Girl\\" especially for it. Plot summary In a frame story, a married woman with children recounts to her friend what happened on her twentieth birthday (the age of majority in Japan). The woman begins by saying she spent that day working overtime as a waitress at an Italian restaurant in Roppongi because her friend called in sick at the last minute. The reclusive owner of the restaurant who lives on the sixth floor gets his food delivered to him room service-style by the manager of the restaurant every night at 8pm. The manager falls ill the night of the woman's birthday so the woman is delegated the responsibility of bringing the owner his food. The woman knocks on the door that evening and finds an elderly man at the door. After explaining the situation, he invites her into the room and asks for five minutes of her time; she agrees. He asks how old she is and she responds that she is twenty now, indirectly telling him that today is her birthday. After saying \\"Happy Birthday\\" to her, he tells her that he can grant her one wish. She makes her wish, leaves the room, and never meets the owner again. Her friend asks her if her wish came true and if she would have wished for something else in hindsight. She says that time will determine if her wish came true and semi-deflects the second question by asking the friend what she would wish for if she was in the woman's position; the friend is unsure and the woman says that is because \\"you've already made your wish.\\" Analysis The setting creates an intense mood for the story. The incessant rain creates an atmosphere that disrupts the ordinary, mundane circumstances of serving tables on your 20th birthday. Like most Murakami tales, there is a story within a story, which adds to the work's effect.

The group formed in 2000, was signed by Lucid Records from 2005 to 2008 and then represented by Shout It Out Loud Music through 2012. Their sound has been characterized as a blend of indie rock and indie pop with elements of psychedelic rock, '70s rock, swing and jazz. Known for energetic live performances, Spain Colored Orange has performed with Modest Mouse, Ben Kweller, The Octopus Project, The Fiery Furnaces, Of Montreal, Ra Ra Riot and Trail of Dead. They also served as backing band and headlining opener for Daniel Johnston on a number of various occasions, including his 50th birthday celebration in 2011. Spain Colored Orange has licensed music for commercial use by companies including Ford, Olay, and Avon. The band has toured nationally and consecutively featured in large-scale regional festivals including South by Southwest and Free Press Summer Fest.  History  The band was established in 2000 as a solo project by frontman Gilbert Alfaro, former founding member of Houston-based national-touring bands Blueprint/In Echoes and Refuse To Fall. Other original members joined after they heard Alfaro's initial taped recordings. The band was originally called \\"8 Track Charade,\\" but changed their name just days before signing a record deal with Lucid Records. According to Alfaro, the band's final name, Spain Colored Orange, originated from an elementary school project that his grandmother had hanging in her house. After signing with Lucid Records in 2005, the band released their debut EP Hopelessly Incapable of Standing in the Way. They ultimately negotiated a break from their contract with Lucid Records in 2008, while in the process of recording a freshman full-length at Houston's historic Sugar Hill Studios. The group signed with Shout It Out Loud Music and released that first full-length record, Sneaky Like a Villain, in 2009.

The directive established a Special Planning Group (SPG) under the National Security Council (NSC) whose purpose was to strengthen, organize, plan, and coordinate public diplomacy of the United States relative to national security. This NSDD positioned the White House and the National Security Staff at the helm of public diplomacy coordination across government agencies. NSDD-77 lay the groundwork for the Reagan administration's aggressive public diplomacy strategy and included guidance for inter-agency working groups to execute wide ranging tactics for information dissemination both domestically and internationally. A National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) is a kind of Presidential Directive in which a President gives instructions to senior advisors and departments concerning matters of national security.Relyea, Harold C. 2008. Presidential Directives: Background and Overview. Congressional Research Service report 98-611.  Background  Public diplomacy and international information programs have been used as instruments of foreign policy since World War II. The Department of State began sponsoring educational and cultural exchanges as early as the 1930s as a method of combating German influence in Latin America. The CIA sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in the 1950s to broadcast messages into the Soviet Bloc. The aggressive public diplomacy initiatives created under the Truman and Eisenhower administrations were not pursued by subsequent administrations until President Reagan in the 1980s. The Reagan administration's dedication to public diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy during the Cold War was unprecedented. Carnes Lord, a principal author of NSDD 77, stated that the \\"beleaguered and defensive bureaucracy was infused with money, high-caliber personnel, and a mandate, and for the first time in many years was admitted to an administration's inner councils. It is also important to underline the personal involvement in public diplomacy operations, not only of the president himself, but of other senior administration policy officials.\\" President Reagan's background as a Hollywood actor, and later governor of California, provided him with access to many powerful individuals with backgrounds in communications, advertising, and entertainment. President Reagan appointed longtime friend and Hollywood financier, Charles Z. Wick, to head the USIA and Frank Shakespeare to chair the Board of International Broadcasting. This team of communication experts, many lacking any significant experience in Washington, enabled the Reagan administration to conceptualize and execute many revolutionary and risky tactics in their shaping of an effective public diplomacy strategy. Dr. Lord goes on to explain, \\"the strategic framework of the Reagan administration's public diplomacy effort featured among other things, direct engagement with Soviet propaganda and disinformation, democracy promotion, and revitalization of U.S. international broadcasting.\\"  Overview of NSDD 77  The Special Planning Group (SPG) was established under the chairmanship of the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (NSA), and consisted of five primary members including: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the United States Information Agency, the Director of the Agency for International Development, and the Assistant to the President for Communications. Other senior officials were invited to attend at the request of the chairman.Reagan, National Security Decision Directive Number 77, 1. NSDD 77 established four interagency committees that would report and be monitored by the SPG. These committees included: the Public Affairs Committee, the International Information Committee, the International Political Committee, and the International Broadcasting Committee. The NSC staff, in coordination with the SPG, called regular meetings of the committee chairmen to insure proper interagency coordination and execution of SPG directed initiatives and guidance. 1. The Public Affairs Committee was responsible for U.S. Government public affairs activities relating to national security objectives. This committee focused on speeches and public appearances for senior officials and was designed to ensure the American public understood and supported the major foreign policy initiatives throughout the world.Reagan, National Security Decision Directive Number 77, 2. 2. The International Information Committee was led by a senior representative of the United States Information Agency. This group was responsible for the planning and execution of all activities associated with international information relative to national security policy. This committee took over for \\"Project Truth\\" and was tasked to implement information in specific geographic areas of interest. 3. The International Political Committee was chaired by a Senior official from the Department of State. This committee was responsible for the coordination and implementation of international political activities relative to U.S. national security interests abroad. This group focused on the training, organization, and aid provided to foreign governments, groups, and institutions dedicated to the growth of democracy. This committee executed plans designed to quell the spread of communist and totalitarian ideologies through direct political action strategies. 4. The International Broadcasting Committee was chaired by a representative from the National Security Council. This group's responsibilities revolved around guidance outlined in National Security Decision Directive 45, United States International Broadcasting.Reagan, National Security Decision Directive Number 77, 3. Public Diplomacy Professor, Dr. J. Michael Waller, stated that NSDD 45 \\"firmly re- established U.S.-sponsored international broadcasting as a national security instrument, subject not only to the guidance of the Secretary of State but also of the National Security Advisor to the President.\\" This portion outlined a plan for elevating U.S. sponsored international broadcasting to an instrument of national security.\\"  Impact of NSDD 77 on Reagan's foreign policy  Though not specifically outlined in NSDD 77, there were a number of sub-groups and departments tasked with employing tactics in line with guidance included in NSDD 77. One of the most notorious was the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin American and the Caribbean (S/LPD or ARA/LPD), a group in existence prior to the release of NSDD 77 and under the leadership of former CIA propaganda specialist, Walter Raymond, and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North in the National Security Council. Managed by Otto Reich, this task force worked with the CIA and U.S. Army to create \\"white propaganda\\" intended to influence Congressional and public opinion into the continued funding of Reagan's campaign against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Reich and his group met with dozens of journalists and reporters during 1984 and 1985, intending to keep them on message with developments in Nicaragua. This inter- agency working group was instrumental in fundraising efforts and fund transfers between private groups and the Democratic Resistance in Nicaragua. The group was disbanded after a September 20, 1987 Iran Contra investigation report in which the Comptroller General discovered S/LPD violated numerous funding restrictions including the use of federal dollars to fund a non- authorized propaganda campaign. NSDD-77 also formalized the process for launching various initiatives that President Reagan and his supporters had been socializing since his inauguration including \\"Project Democracy\\" and the National Endowment for Democracy. These initiatives showcased the political action arm of public diplomacy, underscoring again Reagan's commitment to the spread of democratic ideals worldwide. NSDD-77 propelled numerous agencies throughout the U.S. government to aid in the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the emergence of open societies. Executive branch oversight of these information dissemination strategies insured engagement from high-ranking officials throughout the government and civilian sectors.  Modern-day public diplomacy initiatives  Presidential Decision Directive-68, entitled \\"International Public Information\\" (IPI), was published on April 30, 1999 and remains classified today. The IPI system was designed to mitigate problems with bad press related to military missions in Kosovo and Haiti. This directive was issued with the intent of influencing foreign governments and combating the spread of misinformation from foreign media into the American press. This information policy was designed for use by all government agencies, expanding from solely USIA and State, and accounted for the advance of communication technologies that allowed numerous groups to be involved in information dissemination. President George H.W. Bush issued the still classified National Security Presidential Directive-16 in July 2002 outlining a variety of cyberweapons as a potential instrument of national security. The secret directive directs agencies within the U.S. government to establish guidance for cyberattacks against enemy computer networks. Karen Hughes later initiated multiple social networking tools to engage with the Arab community.

Armes formed a defensive infantry style \\"hollow square\\" with the cavalry mounts in the middle. Seeking better defensive ground, Armes walked his command toward Fort Hays while maintaining the defensive square. After 8 hours of combat, 2,000 rounds of defensive fire and 15 miles of movement, the Cheyenne disengaged and withdrew.

Biography He was born James Harold Skelley in Alleghenyville, Pennsylvania to James and Martha Skelley. His family moved to Davenport, Iowa when he was four. He had four sisters and three brothers. Skelley was educated at Sacred Heart School in Davenport and St. Bede Academy in Peru, Illinois. He left home at the age of 15 and joined the circus. He acted in his first stage production, The Time, the Place and the Girl, at the LaSalle Theater in Chicago when he was 16. For a short period of time he was a backup first baseman for the Boston Braves and a prizefight manager. For his professional name he shortened his middle name Harold to Hal and dropped the final \\"e\\" in Skelley. Skelly became a veteran of medicine shows, musical comedy, burlesque, Lew Dockstader's minstrels and opera. He joined the A.M. Zinn musical comedy company in San Francisco where his eccentric dancing ability earned him the nickname \\"Tumbling Harold Skelly\\". Always enamored with the circus, he spent a year with Barnum & Bailey. Skelly toured China and Japan with a musical comedy troupe, the Raymond Teale Company. Skelly made his Broadway debut in Fiddler‚Äôs Three (1918) and went on to appear in ten other shows on Broadway. In 1927, he played a starring role alongside Barbara Stanwyck, in her first Broadway hit, the musical production Burlesque. Paramount Pictures invited the two to star in the 1929 talkie film version of the show, retitled The Dance of Life because studio executives judged the original title too risqu√©. Stanwyck turned down the offer, while Skelly accepted, reprising his role as \\"Skid Johnson\\". He would make a total of ten films, including the Woman Trap (1929), Behind the Make-Up (1930), and The Shadow Laughs (1933), and was also featured on two movie soundtracks. Death Hal Skelly's grave marker used the original spelling of the family's name. Skelly was killed in a train-auto accident in West Cornwall, Connecticut when the truck he was driving was struck by the New York to Pittsfield train of the New Haven Railroad at a crossing. News reports at the time said he was staying with friends and he was looking for a dog that had run away. His widow, Eunice, brought his body back to New York City for the funeral, which was held in the Actor's Chapel at Saint Malachy's Catholic Church in Manhattan. His mother and his brother Hugh accompanied the body back to Davenport for burial at St. Marguerite's Cemetery, now known as Mount Calvary Cemetery. Broadway Hal Skelly acted in the following shows on Broadway: *Fiddlers Three (1918), as Sam Wigglesbury *The Night Boat (1920), as Freddie Ides *The Girl in the Spotlight (1920), as Watchem Tripp *Orange Blossoms (1922), as Jimmy Flynn *Mary Jane McKane (1923‚Äì1924), as Joe McGillicudy *Betty Lee (1924‚Äì1925), as Wallingford Speed *Burlesque, (1927‚Äì1928), as Skid Johnson *Melody (1933), as Fran√ßois Trapadoux *Ghost Writer (1933), as Bill Harkins *Queer People (1934), as Theodore Anthony White *Come What May (1934), as Chet Harrison Filmography Hal Skelly acted in the following films: *The Dancing Town (1928; short) *The Dance of Life (1929) as 'Skid' *Woman Trap (1929) as Dan Malone *Behind the Make-Up (1930) as Hap Brown *Men Are Like That (1930) as J.

He was also heir of Wilhermsdorf in Franconia and of the sovereign Lordship of Oberstein. He is known for his very extravagant and fastuous lifestyle, which caused his bankruptcy, and for having been the lover of princess Tarakanova. Life Philipp Ferdinand was born on August 21, 1734 in Schillingsf√ºrst. He was the fifth son of Christian Otto count of Limburg Stirum and his wife, n√©e Carolina Juliana princess of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg- Schillingsf√ºrst. The Order of St Philip of the Lion of Limburg was created by the Limburg Stirum to reward persons of exceptional scientific, artistic or civil virtue. After the death of his mother in 1758, he inherited the herrschaft of Wilhermsdorf. Philipp Ferdinand was megalomaniac, and led a fastuous life in his palace of Wilhermsdorf, inspired by the court of Versailles. He had his own court theatre, music chapel and even an own corps of hussar. In 1760, after his elder brother's death, he inherited Styrum. Because of his very extravagant life, he soon had huge debts and was forced to sell Wilhermsdorf in 1769, he then moved to his possessions of Oberstein. Despite of selling many of his assets (tens of farms and castles), his debt kept rising. He also gave money to the Jesuits to create a Catholic school and a Catholic parish in Protestant M√ºlheim. The emperor Joseph II was trying to control the Church and didn't approve of these actions. When he heard about the enormous debts of the count, he sent a fiscalist to Styrum to take action in order to avoid future problems. Despite this reprimand, Philipp Ferdinand kept on living a very extravagant life. In order to raise money he created two orders of chivalry (the Order of St Philip of the Lion of Limburg and the Order of the Four Emperors), which he gave to prominent figures, but usually against a fee. He also tried to claim territories, like the herrschaft of Pinneberg in the County of Holstein or the immediate lordship of Oberstein, that should have become his possession through heritage. This involved him in huge and expensive trials. He finally recovered in 1773 two thirds of the territory of Oberstein. He also claimed the title of Duke of Schleswig- Holstein, which Joseph II refused to recognize. In 1766 he was made prince by the French parliament, but in 1789 Joseph II forbade him to wear this title. In 1770 Philipp Ferdinand was put into prison for not paying his debts. A letter of his brother Ernst Maria to the emperor, in which he insisted on all the services the House of Limburg-Stirum had given to the Empire, was enough to have Philipp Ferdinand released. In 1772 princess Tarakanova, who had left Paris after a scandal, settled in Frankfurt am Main. The court marshal of Philipp Ferdinand, count de Rochefort-Valcourt, told him about this woman who pretended to be the daughter of Elizabeth I of Russia and granddaughter of Peter the Great. Philipp Ferdinand invited her and immediately fell in love with her. She promised to marry him, if he could be surety for all her debts which she had accumulated in Paris. He accepted everything his mistress asked. But in 1774, she left Oberstein for Venice. Despite his own difficult financial situation, Philipp Ferdinand gave her a great sum of money for her trip and also gave her the right to wear the title princess of Limburg Stirum after his death. Philipp Ferdinand had two natural children (a son and a daughter) from his relationship with Marie Therese Satori. These children were illegitimate and couldn't inherit his rights and possessions. He died on September 10, 1794 in Bartenstein. His brother Ernst Maria inherited Oberstein and Styrum. Ernst Maria lost Oberstein soon thereafter when invaded by the French troops.

Originally formed in Colombia, but now based in Los Angeles, Palenke Soultribe (a.k.a. PST) have claimed a spot in the Latin Alternative music world by putting on energetic shows, releasing musically interesting albums and remixes and always pushing the envelope visually and conceptually. The initial line up was formed by producer/bassist Juan Diego Borda and keyboardist/producer Andres \\"Popa\\" Erazo. Currently, PST continues to work as a collective, inviting guest producers, singers, songwriters and instrumentalists to their shows and to contribute on their albums.  Origins  The origins of the band go back to 2001 when Erazo and Borda worked on demos through a project known as Polaina Dinamita. That experiment created an underground buzz in their hometown of Bogota, Colombia, pioneering the experimental fusion of electronica with Caribbean music. Late in 2006, after completing personal projects, the duo decided to reunite in Los Angeles and start producing music again. This time, they took on a new name, Palenke Soultribe, narrowing down their sources of music. This time around PST would be more focused on exploring Afro‚ÄìColombian rhythms rather than incorporating all Latin-American music. = The Band‚Äôs Name = Although Palenque is also the name given to a Maya city in southern Mexico that flourished in the 7th century, Palenke Soultribe actually derives their name from the village of San Basilio de Palenque, a village inhabited by escaped slaves as a refuge in the 17th century.Smithsonian.com \\"Colombia Dispatch 4: Palenque: An Afro-Colombian Community\\" by Kenneth Fletcher. October 29, 2008. The word ‚Äòpalenque‚Äô actually means ‚Äúwalled city‚Äù. Of the many palenques of escaped slaves that existed previously, San Basilio is the only one that survives. These refugees were able to bring their culture, music and traditions to the small villages they formed in the jungle. The palenques are considered by many as the first free territory on the continent. As for the origins of 'Soultribe', Borda elaborates that \\"we just feel like we are a collective of musicians based on the soul, wanting to do great art\\".  Recordings, Releases and Media Attention  =Samba of the World= In 2014, Palenke Soultribe collaborated with COPILOT Music and Sound on a cover of Carlinhos Brown's \\"Maria Caipirnha (Samba da Bahia)‚Äù.

He attended schools in different parts of the empire up to 1893, when he and his parents emigrated to the United States, coming directly to Milwaukee. After graduating from the Milwaukee Public Schools, he attended a local business college for one year, and studied art three years under what his official biography described as \\"the direction of Milwaukee's foremost artists.\\" In 1903 he began an apprenticeship in the office of a local architect and continued to follow the architectural profession.  Legislative service  In 1910, Klenzendorff was elected to the 13th Milwaukee County assembly district (the 13th Ward of the City of Milwaukee) to succeed Republican Charles E. Estabrook, who did not run for re-election. Klenzendorff received 1,123 votes to 906 for Democrat Leander J. Pierson and 805 for Republican Louis H. Jeske.

It originated in Montreal in 1898, but was strongest in Ontario and British Columbia. The leaders espoused a moderate socialism based on Christian reform principles. Members of the league formed provincial socialist parties. In 1905 these parties merged into the Socialist Party of Canada (SPC). Foundation Advertisement in Citizen and Country (4 May 1900) from a tailor who proclaims his support for Trade Unionism The Canadian Socialist League (CSL) was formed in Montreal in 1898 by former members of the Socialist Labor Party. The founders rejected the Labor party leadership of Daniel De Leon. Support for the league appeared about the same time in the summer of 1899 in Montreal and Toronto. In Ontario the CSL was organized by George Weston Wrigley and Thomas Phillips Thompson, both former Knights of Labor, in an effort to pull together the reform forces that had become fragmented after the Patrons of Industry were defeated in the 1896 federal election. The CSL had a local in Port Moody, British Columbia, by January 1900, which became the focus of its activities in that province. John M. Cameron, a former member of the Utopian Ruskin colony, was the organizer in British Columbia. A formal organizing convention for the Ontario Socialist League was held in Toronto in November 1901 to provide the base for the national organization. Wrigley, editor of the CSL's organ Citizen and Country, dominated the league with his Christian socialism. The CSL leader said socialism was applied Christianity and \\"Christ was the first socialist.\\" The league rejected the ideology of class struggle, and emphasized reform and public ownership. It has been described as a transitional group of Ruskinian romantics and moderate Christian socialists. Although Marxist-oriented socialists made the group more radical, the CSL was still wedded to reformist ideals. The CSL was broad and flexible, open to radicals, labourites, socialists, and women's rights activists. Leadership was mostly male and English-speaking. Women who were active in the organization were typically married and did not work for a living. Activities The CSL was primarily concerned with educating the electorate about socialism, and was not a parliamentary party in the modern sense. It held meetings to stir up interest in socialism and to debate subjects such as the relationship between socialism and Christianity. Disputes soon erupted between Protestant ministers and Marxists. The minister Charles Sheldon of Topeka, Kansas, author of the best- selling novel In His Steps, was invited to Toronto to address the league and accepted the position of honorary president of the league's executive. In his writings Sheldon discussed social problems such as unemployment, poverty, racialism, alcohol, corruption and so on, always asking \\"What would Jesus do?\\" Edith Wrigley, wife of the publisher George Wrigley, edited the women's column in the Citizen and Country. She was also active in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In her short-lived column \\"The Kingdom of the Home\\" she discussed issues such as suffrage, charity, prohibition, prostitution and the servant problem. (The so-called \\"servant problem\\" was the problem that middle-class families had with cleaning, cooking, and especially entertaining at the level that was socially expected. It was too much work for any one person to do herself, but middle-class families, unlike wealthy families, could not afford to pay the wages necessary to attract and retain skilled household employees.) Her message was typical of maternal feminism, that love and purity, the values of the home sphere, should also guide politics. Other women activists in the CSL were Emily Stowe and Augusta Stowe-Gullen. Margaret Haile, CSL candidate for North Toronto, from 1902 campaign material In 1902 the CSL nominated Margaret Haile as its candidate for North Toronto in the 1902 provincial election. Haile was also active in the WCTU, and took a maternal feminist position. As a woman she was opposed by various factions, and an attempt was made to exclude her from the ballot. The Toiler, the labour paper, would not endorse her. She won only 81 votes in the election, but was hailed by Citizen and Country as the first woman to run in a political election in the British Empire. Provincial groups In April 1900 the United Socialist Labor Party (USLP) was formed in British Columbia as a splinter group from the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). The first socialist convention was held in British Columbia in October 1900. The CSL cooperated with the USLP at this meeting, where the red flag flew over the hall during the sessions despite attempts by the police to have it hauled down. A provincial federation within the CSL was agreed but was not in fact established. In 1901 the Socialist Party of British Columbia was formed, allied with the Socialist Party of America. Hermon F. Titus, editor of the Seattle Socialist, helped organize this more radical group. He said that Wrigley \\"stood for capitalistic thought, for compromise and for pasturage on both sides of the fence.\\" By January 1902 there were more than sixty CSL branches in Canada, including New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, and the Northwest Territories. The Ontario Socialist League, Socialist Party of Manitoba and Socialist Party of British Columbia had been formed by CSL members. In March 1902 John Cameron organized a CSL local in Winnipeg, recruiting from members of the labour party. In November 1902 the Socialist Party of Manitoba was formed. In 1902 James Hurst Hawthornthwaite, an independent labour candidate who was elected to the British Columbia legislature for the coal-mining constituency of Nanaimo, joined the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Canada. This party had split from the Socialist Party of British Columbia due to ideological differences. The Revolutionary Socialist Party proved short-lived. A series of organizational mergers and splits followed in British Columbia. In 1902 Richard Parmater Pettipiece bought an interest in Citizen and Country, which he moved to Vancouver. With the help of Wrigley the paper began to appear in July 1902 as the Canadian Socialist. It was renamed to Western Socialist, then was merged with two other newspapers and appeared on 8 May 1903 as the Western Clarion. The Western Clarion had a guaranteed circulation of 6,000 three days a week. Although privately owned the paper expressed the views of the Socialist Party of British Columbia, but gave coverage to controversies among Canadian socialist groups. Socialist Party of Canada In May 1903 there were discussions about merging the Socialist Parties of Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia into a national party, but the project was put off due to lack of money. At the end of December 1904 the SPBC held its fourth convention, where delegates were told the locals in Winnipeg, Toronto, and Fredericton, New Brunswick were interested in forming a Socialist Party of Canada (SPC). Wrigley and Thomson helped merge the CSL into the SPC. By 1905 all of the Canadian socialist organizations had come together in the SPC. The party was formed officially on 19 February 1905. The SPC was the first socialist party in Canada to be a serious force in electoral politics. It was radical, advocated the overthrow of capitalism, and rejected the Second International. When the SPC became dominant, this was a step backward for women, since the men who dominated the SPC refused to support women's causes such as suffrage and fair wages. Ian McKay considers that the blend of ideas from Karl Marx and Herbert Spencer into the radical religious materialism of the Canadian Socialist League can be traced in successor socialist groups in Canada for the next twenty years.

In 1536, during the Protestant Reformation, the Commandry was stripped from the Order. The order returned to the castle in 1564, but it was held by the Protestant leaders of Geneva and Bern until a treaty between Geneva and Savoy returned it completely in 1598. The order continued to hold the Commandry until the 1882, when it was transferred to the municipality of Bardonnex. In 1955, the municipality gave one of the rooms in the castle to the Order of Malta to build a museum.

It was founded and administered by the Institute for Women's Health and Leadership at Drexel University College of Medicine.\\"  Founding  The Center was founded in 2009 by a group of women, many of whom were alumnae of The University of Texas School of Law, and many of whom graduated from law school in earlier decades when it was not common for women to pursue law as a career. The group began discussing the issues faced by women lawyers and became determined to understand fully and address effectively the underlying causes of the barriers to advancement faced by women lawyers. These early conversations ultimately led to the creation of the Center for Women in Law. The Founding Members provided the Center with initial funding toward its endowment, and the purpose to improve the status of all women in law.https://law.utexas.edu/cwil/join-a-power-circle/  Mission  The Center's mission is to serve as a national resource to convene leaders, generate ideas, and lead change, and that it advocates for significant and lasting changes in the law and the practice by: * building a national movement by facilitating strategic partnerships through its Consortium for Advancing Women Lawyers; * providing leadership programs that position women lawyers for success at all stages in their careers; * promoting best practices for advancing women in law firms, businesses, and other organizations; * advocating for creative solutions that allow women to raise families while building legal careers; * providing a center for academic research; * serving as a resource to law firms, businesses, and other organizations across Texas and throughout the U.S.  The Austin Manifesto  The Austin Manifestohttp://www.utexas.edu/law/centers/cwil/the-austin-manifesto/ was adopted by acclamation at the 2009 Women's Power Summit on Law and Leadership‚Ñ¢, sponsored by the Center for Women in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, on May 1, 2009.

Heaton, Ph.D., is a professor of earth sciences at The University of South Dakota (USD), Vermillion, specializing in archaeological geology. Having grown up near the Grand Canyon, much of Dr. Heaton's work is focused on the Great Basin as well as on forming chronologies for the extinction of many Ice Age animals; He discovered a new species of fossil skunk (Brachyprotoma) at Crystal Ball Cave, Utah.Heaton, Timothy H. 1985. Quaternary Paleontology and Paleoecology of Crystal Ball Cave, Millard County, Utah: with emphasis on mammals and description of a new species of fossil skunk. The Great Basin Naturalist 45(3) Provo, Utah. Brigham Young University: 337-390. Dr. Heaton has also devoted much of his time evaluating the scientific merits of young- Earth creationist geology and the application of biblical evidence to understanding the earth's prehistory. He is most widely known for his work at On Your Knees Cave located in Prince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska where early humans remains ca. 10,300 years old were found. This find is one of the oldest human genetic samples recovered in the Americas. The site record further supports the possibility the first people into the Americas south of the ice sheets traveled along the Alaskan coast by boat rather than overland through central Canada. Background Dr. Heaton grew up in Utah and was fascinated by the desert canyons of the Colorado River drainage, which led him to pursue a career in geology. He soon became an active hiker and caver in the Grand Canyon. As a graduate student, Heaton learned that the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) was conducting tours through the Grand Canyon teaching that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. This notion fueled his study of the canyon and also led to his review of a publication titled Grand Canyon: Monument to Catastrophe edited and primarily written by Steve A. Austin, the chairmen of ICR's geology department. In Dr. Heaton's review of Austin's publication, Heaton refuted Austin's assertion that the Grand Canyon was formed by a single flood event as well as objections to Austin's theory of a young earth.Heaton, Timothy H. 1995. A review of Grand Canyon: Monument to Catastrophe by Steven A. Austin, editor. Institute for Creation Research, Santee, CA, 1994. 284 pp. Skeptical Inquirer 19(3): 33-36. Dr. Heaton received his bachelor's and master's degrees in geology at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He soon went on to earn a Ph.D. in geology at Harvard University. He did post-doctoral study at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., prior to joining University of South Dakota's Department of Earth Sciences. Current employment Currently, Dr. Timothy Heaton is a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of South Dakota, Vermillion and chair person of the Earth Sciences and Physics Department. He has taught courses such as Historical Geology, Oceanography, Paleontology and the Evolution-Creation debate. Awards and honors While excavating for ice age animal fossils at the On Your Knees Cave site on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska in 1996, Heaton unearthed human remains. An article Heaton co-authored that provided detailed information about the find was placed by Discover magazine in the number 32 spot for top science story for 2007. This find supports the theory that humans first made it to America along the western coast line of North America.

Dr. Heaton and a number of undergraduate students from the University of South Dakota have continued excavating caves found on the Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. The excavations were funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society. On Your Knees Cave, Alaska A current theory in the anthropological community is that the first people to occupy the Americas had migrated from Southeast Asia via the Bering Land Bridge and then continued a coastal migration into the Americas.Dixon, E. James, Timothy H. Heaton, Terrance E. Fifield, Thomas D. Hamilton, David E. Putnam and Frederick Grady, 1997. Late Quaternary Regional Geoarchaeology of Southeast Alaska Karst: A Progress Report. Special Issue: Geoarchaeology of Caves and Cave Sediments. Geoarchaeology: An International Journal, E. James Dixon, ed., 12(6):689-712. Archaeological, physical anthropological, and linguistic evidence is used in of support these inquiries. On Your Knees Cave Site on Prince of Wales Island on the southern Pacific coast of Alaska produced early human remains dating to ca. 10,000 years ago. It is called the On Your Knees Cave because you have to crawl on your hands and knees in order to enter the cave. There are caves in many parts of Prince of Wales Island due to Southeastern Alaska's karst topography. In 1996, Dr. Heaton and his team of excavators discovered the human remains of a deceased male in his twenties, which include a mandible, the remains of a right pelvis, a series of vertebrae, and several teeth. The mandible was carbon dated at an Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility in California to 9,730 years before present.Gove, Harry E. 1998. From Hiroshima to the Iceman: The Development and Applications of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. Bristol: Iop Institute of Physics (1 edition): p. 94. According to Dr. Heaton, this research will help determine the terrestrial and marine animals that occupied this region in the past and present and aid in examining the Last Glacial Maximum‚Äôs effects on their existence. The goal of this project is to establish the time period of glaciation, the existence of coastal areas where land mammals survived through the ice age, and whether humans first entered North America by this coastal route. There are two conclusions that Dr. Heaton and his associates came to after their extensive survey and archeological excavating of the Southeast Alaska area. Firstly, the animal record (under study by Dr. Tim Heaton and Fred Grady) demonstrates that coastal Southeast Alaska contained ice-free land areas which were occupied by many terrestrial and marine animals during all of the Last Glacial Maximum. This evidence shows that humans could have survived in this environment at the time. Secondly, the archaeological record (under study by Dr. James Dixon and colleagues) shows that though this was not the earliest settlement in the Americas, it proves that people occupied Southeast Alaska much earlier than thought, which makes the Northwest Coast an even more likely route for entry into the Americas.

The 2,800-seat St. George Theatre was built for Staten Island theater operator Solomon Brill and opened on December 4, 1929. Eugene De Rosa was the St. George Theatre's main architect, and was assisted by Staten Island resident James Whitford, the ‚Äúdean of Staten Island architects\\". The ornate interior of the St. George Theatre was designed by Nestor Castro. The interior is a variety of Spanish and Italian Baroque styles. The movie and vaudeville house outshone most of its competitors, including Manhattan's Capitol Theater on Broadway. The theatre was renovated in 2004. A variety of activities, including educational programs, architectural tours, television and film shoots, concerts, comedy, Broadway touring companies, and children's shows take place there. History Construction started in 1928. The theater was built for Solomon Brill, who owned several other theaters on the Island and 15 in the greater New York area. He envisioned the St. George as a show house to rival Manhattan's cinema palaces, and promised to bring top-of-the-line vaudeville to the borough for 75 cents a ticket. The theater opened on December 4, 1929, at a cost of $2 million, $500,000 of which was for the theater. Brill sold the theater within three years to William Fox, namesake of Fox Television Stations and 21st Century Fox. Poster for a Federal Art Project exhibition at the St. George Theatre (1941) Fabian Theatres, a movie theatre chain, owned and operated the St. George Theatre as its flagship on Staten Island in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Visitors to the St. George Theatre today who utilize the men's room on the main level are actually in what was once the district office for Fabian Theatres in 1965. In the late 1960s, the Fabian chain was broken up; the theatre was operated by Fabian's former general manager until 1975. When that organization departed, the theatre was leased to a Staten Island concern, Victoria Theatres. It was the plan of these young entrepreneurs to return the theatre to its roots: live stage shows and concerts integrated with film. For the first time since the 1950s, the St. George stage was used as a presentation stage, and not simply as a base for its massive movie screen. Although Victoria Theatres only operated the St. George for approximately a year‚Äîfrom April 1976 to February 1977, Sly Stone, Chaka Kahn, and Lester Flatt represented the broad diversity of music acts who graced the St. George's stage during that period. In 1978, the St. George Theatre ended its life as a movie house. Several entrepreneurs tried to revive it as a dinner theater, a nightclub and an antiques showroom but none were successful. Others tried their hands at revival and renovation, but it was finally Rosemary Cappozalo, in league with her daughters, Luanne Sorrrentino and Doreen Cugno who, in 2004, began a not-for-profit organization to save the historic theatre. Since the theatre reopened in June 2004, over 400 events have taken place there. In mid-2017, the theater closed for a $5.2 million, several-month-long renovation to renovate the mezzanine seating and add a LED marquee.  Design  The main architect for the theatre was Eugene De Rosa. He was assisted by Staten Island resident James Whitford, who was known as the ‚Äúdean of Staten Island architects.‚Äù Whitford also designed the Ritz, Liberty and Victory theaters, none of which exist today. The ornate interior of the St. George Theatre was designed by Nestor Castro, the art director for the Libman-Spanjer Corporation, which designed the interiors of many theaters in the Times Square area. The theatre's Spanish and Italian Baroque revival style interior was designed by Nestor Castro. The theatre has unobstructed seating, a $25,000 Wurlitzer organ, an advanced cooling and heating system, one of the largest cantilevered balconies ever built, velvet seats, gilded balconies, and grand staircases. Either because or in spite of the theatre's ornate interior‚Äîdecorative gold plasterwork, stained glass and ironwork‚Äîthe St. George is noted for near-perfect acoustics. It is not uncommon, to this day, for a performer to stand beneath its six-story proscenium and remark on how beautiful the theatre looks and sounds. It is possible to stand center stage and hold a room-level conversation with someone in the upper balcony, six stories away without raising one's voice. Even though generations of Staten Islanders refer to or remember the St. George as a movie palace, the original 2,876 seat structure was planned as part of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) vaudeville circuit. Only when the theatre was nearly complete in 1929 was a projection booth and spotlight stand contrived by the architects and added to the theatre's interior.  Use  The first movie to be shown at the St. George Theatre was So This Is College which was a 1929 M-G-M production that starred Eddie Nugent, Robert Montgomery and Cliff Edwards. Famous performers such as Al Jolson, Kate Smith and Guy Lombardo performed on the theatre's stage.

Culture and religion The majority of the population of Savnas is of the Islamic faith with sizable numbers of Buddhists located in the area of Buddha Wadi and also Hindus. Surve is the surname of a majority of the inhabitants. Savnas has a primary school till Grade 7 and had a high school till grade 10 which is now shut due to fewer students enrolling. For further studies, most students enrol in a college in karji or in khed. A major chunk of the economy depends on remittances from the Gulf countries sent by a semi skilled and skilled workforce. Agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing though formed the backbone of the local economy till the 70's, it is now neglected as the young workforce is lured by the lucrative salaries offered by the gulf countries. Sanvnas has its shares of doctors, engineers and lawyers who though have stayed away for a long time do visit occasionally thus maintaining a link with their roots. Traditional attire includes shirt and lungs for men and saree an Salwar suit for women. Though the village boasts different religious communities, there has never been any untoward incident amongst them with everyone getting along humanely. There are 4 Masjids namely Jaama, Minara, Baugh morally and Aameena Masjid serving the Muslim population. There is also a Dargah built on a hilltop which organises the annual Urs though devotees visiting is declining due to more people being guided onto the path of As Salaf As Salih.

Its basic design has changed little since it was adopted on July 8, 1908, except during period from 1960 to 1975 when the municipality of Rio de Janeiro was known as Guanabara State. It resembles the flags of Galicia (before it changed) and the Russian Navy (with some changes). Composition The flag of the City of Rio de Janeiro is a white field with two blue stripes, placed diagonally, forming a band and a bar (that is, in the shape of a saltire, or a St. Andrew's cross). On the crossing of the band and the bar, the city's coat of arms‚Äîa sixth in proportion to the total field‚Äîappears in red. The city's coat of arms has the following heraldic composition: on a red field, there are three silver arrows surmounted by a silver armillary sphere, and over all a silver Phrygian cap. Supporting the shield are two red dolphins, holding at their right a laurel branch and at their left an oak branch. The crest of the shield is a mural crown of five towers, also red. The tinctures, or heraldic colors, of the coat of arms on this shield are altered from the traditional coat of arms, which has a blue field, golden arrows and sphere, and a red Phrygian cap. The dolphins are normally silver, the leaves they hold green, and the mural crown gold. The blue and white of the flag symbolize the Portuguese origin of the city, as they are the traditional colors of the Portuguese monarchy, adopted since the creation of the County of Portugal in 1097. (It was only after the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic on October 5, 1910 that Portugal began to use the colors dark green and red on their flag.) The color red on the flag of Rio de Janeiro symbolizes the blood shed by Saint Sebastian, the saintly patron of the city, as well as the blood shed by the city's founder, Est√°cio de S√°, and the early settlers of Rio de Janeiro.

He then studied Sciences at University of Edinburgh, graduating BA in 1936. In 1937 he began lecturing in Geography at the University of Sheffield. In 1939 Watson married Jessie W. Black (d.1989), a University of Edinburgh Professor of Education. Together they had two children, Margaret and James. The couple moved to Canada the same year. Watson took a position at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, as the University's first regular appointment in geography. He lectured at McMaster from 1939 to 1949.

He applied the ideas of the Chicago school of social ecology to explain urban geography; the basic theory being that the urban landscape can be explained in terms of its society's social structure. His work \\"helped develop social geography as a systematic specialization.\\" For instance, he \\"used the language of the social ecologists to recognize urban transition zones, cultural shatter belts, and distinct zones associated with the different socioeconomic groups within Hamilton.\\"\\"James Wreford Watson: A Biography,\\" Info, PageRankStudio.com, Web, Apr. 21, 2011.

Poetry James Wreford's standing in Canadian poetry rests mainly on two publications. The first was the seminal 1944 anthology Unit of Five, which featured thirteen of his poems (alongside poetry by Louis Dudek, Ronald Hambleton, P. K. Page, and Raymond Souster). The Dictionary of Literary Biography (DLB) says that they show \\"his technical skill - particularly in the use of the quatrain\\"; but also his weaknesses: obscurantism, didactism, and a habit of asking questions, \\"which becomes ponderous at times.\\" The DLB classified the poetry of Wreford's award-winning first book, Of Time and the Lover (1950), \\"as Christian pastoral elegy in that many of his poems portray man existing in a fallen world.... The poet seeks for himself and mankind ... redemption, renewed life, and hope.\\" It also noted Watson's \\"use of climatological, geological, and geographical images and metaphors.\\" Geography was also prominent in Wreford's second and last book of poetry, 1979's Countryside Canada. There the poet \\"responds through poetry to a series of places, from Newfoundland to the Yukon ... the geographer-poet attempts to demonstrate the strength of his culture and his own personal roots in it.\\" Recognition Watson's first book of poetry, Of Time and the Lover, won the Governor General's Award in 1950. Watson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1954, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1957.

The incident started when Coates hurled one high and tight pitch and struck Ricardo Joseph of Vancouver on the shoulder. Then, Joseph charged the mound but, before he could get to Coates, he was tackled from behind and had his chin bloodied by Ranew. The ensuing free-for-all finally subsided, but then Vancouver's Tommie Reynolds pushed a bunt up the first base line, which forced Coates to field the ball while Reynolds tried to run the pitcher down. Once more Ranew raced to the aid of Coates. Nevertheless, Rosario dashed from the on-deck circle and hit Ranew over the head with his bat, opening up a deep three-inch gash.

In the first podcast, he claimed that Industry Canada did not seize a working homemade 30-watt transmitter which was unlabeled.  Criminal trial and verdict  On March 31, 2011, the operator of the pirate radio station appeared in court as a young offender for the charge of violating the Radiocommunication Act. Further, he faced four charges of criminal harassment and three counts of uttering threats against announcers Ryan Lindsay of 89.9 CIHT-FM, John Mielke of 93.9 CKKL-FM his industry website Milkman Unlimited, and Industry Canada employee Mylene Quesnel, and was also charged with assaulting a police officer and obstruction of justice.\\"Teen threatened to kill radio host\\".

At trial, Lindsay testified that he had received threats on January 15, 2010, after playing the same songs as Mix FM had. Quesnel testified that the teenager had been screaming angrily when Industry Canada forcefully shut down the station. An unidentified employee of CFRA was also threatened.\\"Teen under arrest was 'like a child throwing a temper tantrum,' court hears\\". Ottawa Citizen, April 01, 2011. The teenager admitted that, after calling Lindsay fifty times over the course of four months, the teenager then said he would kill Lindsay. In court, the teenager said he hadn't been serious, even though he had shown up at the station 30 minutes later, driven there by his father. The teenager also admitted to telling a police officer that the Industry Canada investigator would be \\"better off dead\\". He denied posting a video asking if he should \\"shoot\\" Mielke for reporting allegedly suicidal online messages to police; the teen said he had used the word \\"sue\\" rather than \\"shoot\\", and that the police accusing him of using \\"shoot\\" was the reason that he was so angry that police handcuffed him to a paramedic backboard to get him to the hospital. Judge Donald Ebbs ruled on April 7, 2011, that the teenager was guilty on three counts of uttering threats and two counts of criminal harassment, as well as the Radiocommunication Act charge. The boy was acquitted of two counts of criminally harassing Ryan Lindsay because Lindsay was never afraid of him. He was also acquitted of assaulting an Ottawa Police Officer and obstructing an RCMP officer. Sentencing for the youth was scheduled for June 24, 2011; however, it was delayed until September 1, 2011. At sentencing, the youth was given a conditional discharge, 15 months of probation and 60 hours of community service.

Duc came to prominence early, with his very well received work at the July Column in Paris, and spent much of the rest of his career on a single building complex, the Palais de Justice.  Biography  Born in Paris, Duc was educated at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he was a student of Percier. Duc took the Prix de Rome in 1825 for a design of a proposed Paris City Hall. During his three-year stay at the Villa de Medici in Rome his associates there included F√©lix Duban, Henri Labrouste and L√©on Vaudoyer. Upon his return from Rome Duc's first significant commission was the decoration for the July Column, built from 1831 to 1840. Appointed as assistant to Jean-Antoine Alavoine, Duc took over the entire project on Alavoine's death in 1834. The foundation of the column is Alavoine's work; the column itself is acknowledged as solely Duc's work.Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects, page 210 July Column, Paris, dedicated 1840 Immediately after the dedication of the July Column in mid-1840, Duc was awarded the position of architect for the Palais de Justice by the respected Antoine Vaudoyer, member of the Institut de France and father of Duc's friend and associate L√©on Vaudoyer. With the appointment Duc simultaneously was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. Duc would spend his remaining thirty-nine years renovating and extending the Palais de Justice, for instance designing the Cour de Cassation. Almost completed at the time of the Paris Commune, the complex was burned on 24 May 1871 and partially destroyed. Duc's other commissions, though rare, include the 1862 chapel of the small college Louis-le-Grand, now the Lyc√©e Michelet, in Vanves. Duc received the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1867, was elevated to Commander of the Legion of Honor,Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects, page 210 and was elected to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts in 1879.

A. C., III. 2004: Evidence of Pre-Clovis Sites in the Eastern United States. In Paleoamerican Origins: Beyond Clovis, pp. 103-12. Center for the Study of the First Americans, Texas A&M; University, College Station. The site was excavated from 1992 to 1997 by paleogeographer Jerry N. McDonald of the Virginia Museum of Natural History. The Saltville Valley today is located in the valley and ridge province of the Appalachian Mountains near southwest Virginia. The valley is shaped like a scalene triangle, and it measures in elevation 1740‚Äô/530 m above sea level, 8000‚Äô/2.4 km lengthwise, and 2750‚Äô/0.84 km at its greatest width. Over 20 percent of the valley is submerged in standing water due to industrial mining of salt brine from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.McDonald, J. N. 2000: An outline of the pre- Clovis archaeology of SV-2, Saltville, Virginia, with special attention to a bone tool dated 14,510 yr BP. Jeffersoniana 9, 1‚Äì59. Site SV-2 is located in the south western part of the Saltville Valley by the northern edge of an artificial reservoir established by the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation from 1964-1965. Background The southern and eastern boundaries of the Saltville Valley are located near the Saltville Thrust Fault, and the northwestern areas are bordered by the Upper Mississippian Little Valley, Hillsdale, and Ste. Genevieve/Gasper limestones. The valley rests on the Upper Mississippian Maccrady Formation, an erratic sequence of shales, siltstones, and minor sandstones that possesses limestones that integrate considerable amounts of gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. Prior to 13,500 RCYBP in late Pleistocene times, the valley contained a river which subsequently transformed into a lake. This phenomenon sealed the bottom of the valley with mud and produced environmental conditions conducive to the preservation of late glacial fauna and flora. The lake has been dubbed Lake Totten, after local amateur historian Charlie Bill Totten, and was created as a result of an increased flow volume from the lower part of the Saltville River that previously ran through the valley. Explanations for this include increased rain, and the upper Saltville River being pirated by the lower McHenry Creek. The subsequent blockage of the Saltville gap emptied the Saltville River into the North Fork of the Holston River. After the formation of Lake Totten, colluvial sediments intensively flowed periodically into the shallow water north of the site, and eventually the reduction of the lake exposed lacustrine mud. This accounts for a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock spanning 5,000 years from 14,510 to 13,000 RCYBP in the late Pleistocene. Major faunal discoveries Striking fossilized specimens of various megafauna have been uncovered in the Saltville Valley for a little over two centuries. Fossils were first reported by Arthur Campbell in a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1782. Noteworthy discoveries appearing in the valley include megafauna such as Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs giant ground sloth (megalonyx jeffersonii), woolly mammoth (mammuthus primigenius), musk-ox (bootherium sp.), mastodon (mammut americanum), horse (Equus sp.), a possible elk moose (cf. cervalles), and a giant short faced bear(arctodus simus).Schubert, B. W. & Wallace, S. C. 2009 (August): Late Pleistocene Giant Short Faced Bears, Mammoths, and Large Carcass Scavenging in the Saltville Valley of Virginia, U.S.A. Boreas, vol. 38, pp 482, 492. Fossilized mastodon remains of a single individual were found at SV-2 that may have been killed, butchered, and cooked, indicating possible Pre Clovis activity in the Saltville Valley. Musk-Oxen were discovered in the Saltville Valley by Clayton E. Ray during joint salvage test excavations held from 1966 through 1967 by the Smithsonian and Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In 1978, the remains of thirty four fossilized musk oxen were discovered by C.S. Bartlett Jr. in a salvage excavation. The spring of 1980, Jerry McDonald discovered the third most complete musk oxen skeleton ever found with a total of 49 bones circa 1983. Fossilized components of a giant short faced bear (arctodus simus) were discovered in 1999 in the form of a canine, and supplementing dentary found a year later nearby. These are the only known carnivorous megafauna that have been found in the Saltville Valley. AMS radiocarbon dates were taken from a sample of preserved collagen and produced a date of 14,853 + 55 RCYBP for the fossil. This is the only specimen of giant short faced bear found in the Appalachian Highlands. Mammoth remains are currently being excavated as of 2009. A set of complete ribs, vertebrae, a scapula, and tarsals have been found to date. A left astragalus, left calcaneus, and an undistinguished partial carpal or tarsal exhibit postmortem alterations that may represent carnivorous scavenging by either a wolf (canis dirus), large bear (arctodus simus), or an American lion (panthera atrox). The collagen taken from the mammoth yielded an age of 14,510 + 55 RCYBP. It was determined that the remains were scavenged. Major floral discoveries In 1967, samples gathered from the endocranial cavity of a musk-ox yielded pollen that demonstrated the Saltville Valley contained a spruce parkland with ponds, marshes, and prairies. Additional knowledge about the environment was revealed by a sediment sample reported by H. R. Delcourt and P.A. Delcourt in 1986 which displayed mixed forest with boreal conifers, and hardwoods. The bottom land was characterized by spruce, fir, grasses, shrubs, herbs, and sedges that display boreal woodland marshes. The most recent study of the valley published in 2007, examined megafaunal herbivores for their trophic relationships. The carbon nitrogen isotope ratios from preserved bone collagen and other fossilized organic matter indicated C-4 plants and grasses were absent in the bottomlands of the valley, with C-3 vegetation dominant. Stratigraphy There are seven stratigraphic levels present within the Saltville Valley in archaeological context. The first two are H-1 through H-2, and represent the historic periods through the early, middle, and late Holocene. At site SV-2 H-1 is not present since it was removed by bulldozers in 1964-1965. The next 4 levels are labeled W-1 through W-4. W-1 represents the transition from late Wisconsinan to Holocene period, and the subsequent W levels display the rest of the late Wisconsinan. P-1, the last level exhibits the Upper Mississippian Maccrady Formation. SV-2 and pre-Clovis activity Evidence of pre-Clovis activity was found at the SV-2 site. There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock. These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP. The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80 RCYBP (Beta-117541) by the presence of a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated. Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering. Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives with worked edges that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or wedge, a piece of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation. It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2 mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36 mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section. The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion fracture cone in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as a meat or hide splitter. The middle horizon contains two features in a fluvial sand lens. The first has a collection of lithics that are either stone tools, byproducts of stone tools, or material with the potential to be made into stone tools. Also present were fish bones, a piece of charcoal, and 12 pieces of microdebitage of which three show signs that bifacial retouch occurred. The second feature contained seven concretions. Five of these were elongated, and one was prismatic. These were found in maroon mud, but were grey bodied. Indicating they originated in a different sedimentary environment. All pieces found originated as congealed viscous body fat, but was replaced by minerals from ground water. Twigs were found in the sand lens that provided a date of 13,950 + 70 RCYBP Beta (65209). The youngest horizon contained one feature that contained 200 immature individuals of the giant floater clam, Pyganodon grandis, a mussel which usually lives in impoundments or slow moving streams beneath mud. Fish and amphibian vertebrates were uncovered with charcoal, lithic debris, and 125 possible pieces of foreign microdebitage that yield a small number of pieces connected to bifacial retouching. This feature is thought to date from 13,500 to 13,000 RCYBP because of interpretive information about the deposit‚Äôs creation. References Further reading Goodyear. A.

The team compete in Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divis√£o, the fourth tier of the S√£o Paulo state football league. It was founded on March 24, 1947 and its colors are red and white. History The history of the Itapirense is, to say the least, curious. Founded on March 24, 1947, right in the year of its foundation, it competed in its first official competition for the Campeonato do Interior. In the Paulista Championship, it started only in the following decade, in the Third Division (current Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A3), disputing two seasons: 1954 and 1957. During this period, Itapirense revealed defender Hilderaldo Bellini, captain and world champion with the Brazilian National Team in 1958, who eternalized the gesture of lifting the world title. At the time of the 1958 World Cup, the defender was already defending the Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama. The club stayed away from professionalism between 1954 and 1956, returning to the Third Division in 1957. At that time, the club did not pass the first phase, being eliminated by the now extinct Expresso S√£o Carlos. In the next ten seasons, the Itapira team was far from professionalism, dedicating itself only to amateur competitions. Years later, in 1969, Itapirense was back in the Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divis√£o (Fourth division) and, surprisingly, lifted the title of champion, but, in the same unusual way, gave up competing the following year, returning only 36 years later. The year 2005 marked the resurgence of the club, with a new work plan the social action, which is designed to keep children and adolescents in the city of Itapira away from violence and drugs, interfering positively in the families of the youth of the club. For this, the U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16 and U-20 categories were created, with the latter competing in the Paulista Championship of the category. Besides taking the boys off the streets, the project offers dental and health treatment, education, and social promotion. In 2006, based on the youth teams, the professional team participated again in a competition of the FPF, the Paulista Segunda Divis√£o (Fourth Division), reaching 12th place among the 48 teams registered. The club rose in 2007 to Serie A-3, after being runner-up in the fourth division. In its debut in the Serie A3 in 2008, Itapirense made a regular campaign, reaching a modest 13th place. In 2009, the team made a better campaign. It reached the final quadrangular and fought for access until the last round, but ended the championship without getting the spot for the Serie A2. The first classification for the A2 series came after a regular campaign in 2013. On January 25, 2014, Sociedade Esportiva Itapirense made its debut in the Campeonato Paulista A2, against S√£o Caetano, winning 2-1. [1] However, after a poor campaign, marked by controversy with coach Paulinho Cear√° and striker Finazzi, the club ended the championship in the relegation zone, returning to the A3 in 2015. The stay in the A3 did not last long, considering that Vermelhinha was relegated to Second Division. The team graduated in 2016, returning only in 2018, to dispute the Second Division.

The Office Building and U.S. Light- House Depot Complex, designed by Alfred B. Mullet and completed in 1865, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and comprise an official New York City Landmark. In the late 1990s, New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) took over the site and created a public plaza; a public fishing pier (Pier 1); a fully functioning building that was supposed to house a gift shop for the National Lighthouse Museum. EDC also stabilized the building adjacent to the gift shop for the purpose of housing the Museum's artifacts. In 2015 the National Lighthouse Museum opened within the complex. The Lighthouse Point development is also being constructed next to the historic building complex. The site has views of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Brooklyn's Shore Parkway, Governors Island, and Manhattan. During the summer months, concerts and events sponsored by local organizations such as Staten Island Community Board 1 and the Downtown Staten Island Council attract tourists from the ferry as well as local residents. Complex  The Office Building and U.S. Light-House Depot Complex, also known as the Old Administration Building for the Third District U.S. Coast Guard, is a historic office building and light house repair depot complex. The complex consists of four buildings: the three-story brick and sandstone office building in the Second Empire style; two brick warehouses; and a small one-story brick building formerly used as a laboratory. The office building was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under Alfred B. Mullett in 1869. The warehouses were built about 1845 and in 1868. The older warehouse is in the Greek Revival style. Note: This includes and Accompanying six photographs  United States Lighthouse Board  The office building was constructed during the time that U.S. lighthouses were administered by the United States Lighthouse Board, which had been founded in 1851 to improve lighthouse technology and management practices. The board divided the nation into 12 districts, each served by a depot where supplies for the district's lighthouses were stored, particularly the flammable fuels in use at that time, which required specialized handling. The depot in St. George, Staten Island served the Third Lighthouse District, which stretched from Maine to Delaware and thus included many of the best known and historic lights on the Eastern Seaboard, including Sandy Hook Light, Montauk Light, and Barnegat Light. Vaults for fuel storage remain on the depot property, and other supplies were stored in the warehouses. The laboratory building was used to research improved materials and techniques for use in U.S. lighthouses. The functions of the Lighthouse Board were transferred to other U.S. government agencies starting in 1903, and ultimately to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939.  History  = Site = The present site of the St. George Coast Guard Station was the location of the New York Marine Hospital, also known as the Quarantine, which opened in 1799 or 1800. Long before the construction of the immigrant processing center on the Battery, and later Ellis Island, immigrants found to be in poor or questionable health were segregated from other immigrants and from the local population in the hospital. The Quarantine was New York City‚Äôs first line of defense against immigrant-borne infectious diseases like Smallpox, Cholera, Typhus and Yellow fever. As many as 1,500 individuals could have been accommodated there at one time. After a series of epidemics in the 1850s, a riotous mob of locals burned the twenty buildings of the hospital complex to the ground in the Staten Island Quarantine War of 1858. = Founding and heyday = The Staten Island Lighthouse Depot was constructed on the former hospital site in 1862 by the United States Lighthouse Service (USLHS). It was the key manufacturing, storage, supply and maintenance center for the USLHS‚Äôs 3rd District. Growing steadily in both size and capability during the late 19th and early 20th century, the Staten Island Depot reached its peak size during and after World War I. Two shops were constructed to handle the construction and maintenance of lightship lenses, most of which weighed thousands of pounds and were several feet tall. Subterranean storage areas, called \\"The Vaults\\", were built to store fuels and other combustible materials for lighthouses, and an entire machine shop and foundry where anchors, sinkers, chains, buoys, and lighthouse structural members were fabricated were all in full operation by the 1920s. Advancing technology saw many lighthouses automated during the 1920s and 1930s and replaced with more reliable electronic beacons, something which heavily altered the scope of the Depot's mission as much of the upkeep, maintenance and lighthouse keeper supply work it performed was severely curtailed. This tail-off of work was checked by the massive increase in the use of Floating Aids-to-Navigation, or buoys. The Staten Island Depot's foundry became one of the key manufacturing and maintenance point for many of the buoys used along the East Coast of the United States, its quayside spaces became a forest of ocean buoys, channel markers, ice buoys, day-marks and their chains, anchors and sinkers. = Decline = With the USLHS's merger into the US Coast Guard in 1939, the Staten Island Depot continued its work, but during World War II it became more of a ship repair and outfitting space as many USCG Cutters, buoy tenders and harbor patrol craft called the Depot for wartime repainting, arming and voyage repairs. Following the war, the depot continued this work in addition to its maintenance and fabrication work and by 1950 it was one of the US Coast Guard's major supply depots in the Northeast. Advancing technology again caught up with the Depot by the 1960s as all lighthouses had been automated with low-maintenance beacons, only two lightships were in service, and the amount of Buoy Tenders in USCG service began to drop as each ship became more operationally capable. Budget cuts and Consolidation in the late 1960s saw much of the Staten Island Depot's workload sent to the USCG Yard at Curtis Bay, Baltimore, Maryland. In 1966 the Coast Guard moved its remaining operations to Governors Island, and the site became surplus property. It appears that little was done to safeguard the site from vandalism and the elements and it began to decay. The decline continued even after the Office Building was designated as a New York City landmark in 1980, and the entire site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. =Redevelopment= In the late 1990s the New York City Economic Development Corporation acquired the property, and in 1998 the site was selected to be the site of the National Lighthouse Museum. By this time the buildings, having been abandoned for over thirty years, were in serious need of restoration. The museum resumed fundraising in 2010 and by early 2014 had raised over $400,000, enough to secure a short term lease on the site's building 11, a 1912 machine shop on the boundary of the site. Fundraising for the museum continues. The museum originally planned to open in building 11 in August 2014, but ultimately its opening was delayed until the next year. As of 2014, the other historic structures, including the office building, are fenced off and are in near-ruined condition. In April 2014 the Economic Development Corporation and a developer, Triangle Equities, jointly announced their plan to build a complex, to be completed in 2019 and to be known as Lighthouse Point, that would incorporate the existing historic structures and would include hotel, residential, and retail uses. Work started in 2016 and Lighthouse Point's opening was subsequently pushed back to 2020. However, the developer filed for bankruptcy in September 2019, delaying the complex's opening.

She continued as spokeswoman in other T-Mobile ads in which she was depicted as a pink-and-black leather-clad biker girl. She served as the T-Mobile spokesman primarily from fall 2010 until spring 2013, with occasional appearances since then. Career = Modeling = In 2001, at age 13, Foulkes began modeling in the Toronto area. After high school, she moved to New York City to model for agents. Subsequently, she found modeling work in Singapore and Europe. After returning to New York to model, she began to pursue acting. Foulkes appeared on the April 2009 cover of Mexican Elle magazine and in advertisements for Rugby Ralph Lauren, Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy's, and Tommy Hilfiger. She is represented by Modelwerk and Sutherland Models. As of early 2011, a Los Angeles Times writer described her look as Anne Hathaway meets Kim Basinger, noting that she was still often confused with fellow Canadian Jessica Par√©. = T-Mobile television ads = After struggling for several years as an aspiring model/actress, Foulkes became the T-Mobile 4G spokesperson in fall 2010, despite not using the usual American English pronunciation of \\"mobile\\" in her summer 2009 audition, but rather pronouncing the word as rhyming with \\"smile\\", an accepted pronunciation more common in Canadian English. Her advertising campaign was at first noted for similarities to the 2006-2010 Justin Long/John Hodgman \\"Get a Mac\\" ads. Foulkes derides the iPhone 4 and its exclusive provider at the time, AT&T;, the same way the Apple Inc. derided Windows-based personal computers. As a T-Mobile spokesperson, her most immediate predecessor was Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her T-Mobile USA ads ran on major United States networks and multiple web sites. Although Foulkes was originally only expected to perform in two or three commercials, , she has produced a dozen commercials with more anticipated. Foulkes has been described as a \\"picture-perfect brunette\\". Since becoming the T-Mobile girl, she is known for the pink summer dresses that she wears in most of the ads. She has been styled by Debra LeClair, a stylist at T-Mobile. In August 2011, Sprint Nextel's Virgin Mobile prepaid service referred to T-Mobile and Foulkes with caricature ads featuring a brunette in a pink dress. Two months earlier, Cricket Wireless used negative attack marketing against T-Mobile without referring to Foulkes. Although dresses in the earlier commercials were frequently described as pink, more recent commercials are noted for the use of magenta dresses. T-mobile has a color trademark for the color magenta and markets itself using its corporate colors. One of her more notable commercials was a 2011 holiday season production. On November 30, 2011, T-mobile announced a surprise event at the Woodfield Mall. On December 1, 2011, veteran Glee director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon directed about six surprise singing and dancing mall performances of \\"Home for the Holidays\\" by Foulkes and 100 Chicago-area women in magenta dresses. The performances were later edited into a music video with the hope that it would go viral. The full video was posted on YouTube with a run time of 3:48, and it was presented in a 60-second national television commercial starting on December 12, 2011. The video was produced by Ridley and Tony Scott's RSA Films. The musical director was Paul Mirkovich. On April 17, 2012, T-Mobile launched a rebranded ad campaign that included broadcast and cable TV, Hulu, YouTube, and mobile, as well as print. In the refreshed ad campaign Foulkes starred in a commercial, entitled \\"Alter Ego\\", in which she discards her usual pink dresses and high heels for a black-and-pink biker outfit and boots before embarking on a motorcycle ride. The commercials are perceived as a departure from previous female-friendly Foulkes ads. The commercial was planned to run until Fall 2012, when the complete relaunch of the T-Mobile ad campaign was to have been scheduled. In announcing the ad to the media, T-Mobile said: She has also been a popular sex symbol since the ads started. After months of email support, Foulkes was included in the SI.com feature \\"Hot Clicks\\" on May 18, 2011. During a rash of servicemen's online request of celebrities as escorts to military balls, Airman Adam Stelmack asked Foulkes to the Air Force Ball on Guam, and she declined by posting a video. In March 2013, Foulkes was described as \\"one of the most recognizable brand spokespeople\\" by Business Insider journalist Laura Stampler even after converting from a pink dress wardrobe to a bad girl/biker chick image. Later that spring, when T-Mobile prepared for its April rollout of the iPhone 5, it selected an advertising campaign without Foulkes, ending her two and a half-year tenure as spokesperson. Foulkes' last new commercial was posted to YouTube on February 25, 2013. The new ad campaign featured Cowboys. T-Mobile debuted its new ad campaign on March 26, 2013, without Foulkes. The company has said that the 'T-Mobile Girl' character has been sidelined for now, but this is believed to be a permanent advertising change. An official T-Mobile statement said: \\"This campaign represents a new direction for the brand -- offering consumers a simple choice. As such, the current campaign will not feature the character of the T-Mobile Girl, but she is still a part of the company's brand family.\\" In early July 2013, Foulkes returned to participate in T-Mobile press events. At the same time, she tweeted a six-second Vine video hinting that she would be returning to the ad campaign. In September, Foulkes appeared in a T-Mobile public service announcement regarding texting and driving. On October 10, 2013, T-Mobile announced that they had signed a multi-year contract with Shakira as a corporate spokesperson. Foulkes would not be part of the campaign, but remained under contract with T-Mobile and vaguely remained in the future plans. Personal life Foulkes's parents are British, although she was raised in Toronto and attended Loretto Abbey. She has two sisters, Kimmy and Angie. She spent summers in England while growing up. Foulkes is a video game junkie. She also describes herself as adept at skateboarding. Despite the association with pink dresses due to the T-Mobile ad campaign, Foulkes claims not to wear pink in her personal wardrobe, describing herself in high school as \\"a little punk-music kid\\" wearing black leather. When asked about her status as an Internet sex symbol, Foulkes said she does not classify herself as such: \\"I'm flattered, but it's funny.\\" References  External links   * Instagram modelling page * Instagram photography site 1988 births Actresses from Toronto Canadian expatriate actresses in the United States Canadian female models Canadian film actresses Canadian television actresses Living people ","title":"Carly Foulkes"},{"id":"31559414","text":"Szczepaniak is a Polish surname.

Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces many adverse physical and psychological effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence in pregnancy.Johnson, J.K., F. Haider, K. Ellis, D.M. Hay, S.W. Lindow. \\"The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women.\\" BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 110.3 (2003): 272-75. Web. 22 Mar 2011. Although female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women.Stephenson, Rob, Michael A. Koenig, Rajib Acharya and Tarun K. Roy. \\"Domestic Violence, Contraceptive Use, and Unwanted Pregnancy in Rural India.\\" Studies in Family Planning. 39.3 (2008): 177-86. Print. Pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for healthcare workers to screen women for domestic violence though a recent review found that the best way in which to do this is unclear. Reducing domestic violence in pregnancy should improve outcomes for mothers and babies though more good quality studies are needed to work out effective ways of screening pregnant women.  Causes and triggers  Domestic abuse can be triggered by pregnancy for a number of reasons. Pregnancy itself can be used a form of coercion and the phenomenon of preventing an intimate partner's reproductive choice is referred to as reproductive coercion. Studies on birth control sabotage performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between domestic violence and birth control sabotage.Domestic Violence and Birth Control Sabotage: A Report from the Teen Parent Project, Center for Impact Research, 1999. Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of domestic violence for pregnant women is greatest immediately after childbirth.Mezey, Gillian C., and Bewley Susan. \\"Domestic Violence and Pregnancy: Risk Is Greatest after Delivery.\\" BMJ: British Medical Journal. 314.7090 (1997): 1295. Print. Domestic violence can increase a woman's chances of becoming pregnant and the number of children she has, both because the woman may be coerced into sex and because she may be prevented from using birth control. A correlation has been shown between large families and domestic violence. Whereas previously it was thought that having many children and the resultant stress of large families increased likelihood domestic violence, it has been shown that the violence commonly predates the births. Birth control sabotage Birth control sabotage, or reproductive coercion, is a form of coercion where someone manipulates another person's use of birth control - weakening efforts to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Replacing birth control pills with fakes, puncturing condoms, and threats and violence are examples of prevention of an individual's attempt to avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy-promoting behavior of abusive male partners is one method of domestic violence and is associated with unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents.Miller, Elizabeth, Decker, Michelle, Reed, Elizabeth, Male Partner Pregnancy-Promoting Behaviors and Adolescent Partner Violence: Findings from a Qualitative Study with Adolescent Females. Reproductive coercion itself is a form of domestic violence because it results from unwanted sexual activity and hinders a woman's ability to control her body. Forced pregnancy can also be a form of financial abuse when a woman becomes trapped in a relationship because the pregnancy has led to economic dependence for new mothers.Pregnancy offers no protection from abuse Unintended pregnancies are 2 to 3 times more likely to be associated with abuse than intended pregnancies.J.E. Hathaway, L.A. Mucci and J.G. Silverman et al., Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse, Am J Prev Med 19 (2000), pp. 302‚Äì307.

This affects the ability of women to protect themselves from unwanted sexual contact and the consequences of sexual intercourse, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.Violence by Intimate Partners WHO: World Health Organization. A study conducted by the Center for Impact Research on young mothers classified birth control sabotage into two categories: verbal and behavioral. Verbal sabotage is verbal or emotional pressure not to use birth control, or pressure to become pregnant. Behavioral sabotage is the use of force to prevent the use of birth control, or to have unprotected sexual intercourse. Mechanisms In most cases, domestic violence can be prompted by or intensified by pregnancy, but in some cases domestic violence ends during pregnancy because the abuser makes a conscious effort to not harm the fetus.Campbell, JC, Oliver C, Bullock L. ‚ÄúWhy battering during pregnancy?‚Äù AWHONN's clinical issues in perinatal and women's health nursing. 4.3 (1993.) 343. Print. =Decreased violence= Domestic violence does not always increase during pregnancy and can even lead to a hiatus in violence. This phenomenon can provide protection for both the woman and child. Because this can lead to decreased violence, some women use pregnancy as a means of protection against domestic abuse. Since abuse generally restarts after the pregnancy ends, women may get pregnant intentionally to prevent violence. However, since women who have been abused before getting pregnant are more likely to experience violence during pregnancy, this is not a reliable means of protection.Bacchus, Loraine,, Gill Mezey, Susan Bewley, and Alison Haworth. \\"Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy.\\" BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology 111.5 (2004): 441-45. Web. 22 Mar 2011 =Increased violence= Although pregnancy can be a protective period for some women, either in terms of a hiatus of pre-existing violence, for others it is a risk period during which abuse may begin or escalate. Women with violent partners have a hard time protecting themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexual violence can directly lead to pregnancy.Heise LL, Ellsberg M, Gottemoeller M. Ending violence against women. Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Center for Communications Programs, 1999 (Population Reports, Series L, No. 11). Studies consistently indicate that domestic violence is more common in large families.Tjaden P, Thoennes N.

Washington, DC, National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781). However, international studies show that 25% of women are abused for the first time during pregnancy. In one study conduct by Campbell et al., women were asked to speculate on why they thought they were abused during their pregnancies. The answers were categorized into four categories: *Jealousy towards the unborn child *Anger towards the unborn child *Pregnancy specific violence not directed toward the child *‚ÄúBusiness as usual.\\" Effects There are many dangerous effects that violence during pregnancy can cause for both the mother and child.

Department of Health and Human Services. ‚ÄúPhysical Violence: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring system [www.schs.state.nc.us/SCHS/data/prams.cfm] Partner violence in a relationship increases the chances of unintended pregnancy. A Canadian study that outlined causes of physical abuse identified ‚Äúsocial instability‚Äù (e.g. low age, unmarried, lower level of education, and unemployment) as a trigger for violence and used unplanned pregnancies as an example. This suggests that partner violence can lead to increased unintended pregnancies which, in turn, increases physical abuse.Stewart DE, Ceccutti A. Physical abuse in pregnancy. Can Med Assoc J 1993;149: 1257‚Äì1263 Younger women are statistically more susceptible to reproductive coercion and this may be due to less experience in relationships and, for minors, less access to doctor's appointments and emergency contraception. Adolescents are especially at risk and teenage pregnancy is correlated with increased rates of domestic violence. Young women with older boyfriends are more likely to experience domestic violence. Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are less likely to use contraception and more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy. Epidemiology A study done on reporting rates of domestic violence concluded that a woman's risk of physical and sexual violence during pregnancy is under-reported and underestimated.

The formation of the department was conceptualized during World War I when problems with food shortages became a critical issue for the nation. The inspiration to develop the faculty of the Food Science Department began when Dr. Frank Waugh asked Walter Chenoweth to give a paper to a group of fruit growers. In the summer of 1913, Chenoweth set up a laboratory and so it began teaching and demonstrating food preservation.UMass Amherst Food Science ‚Äì First in the Nation. University of Massachusetts Amherst, retrieved April 22, 2011  Walter Chenoweth  The Walter Chenoweth Laboratory The new department established a very intensive campaign in community food preservation under the leadership of Walter Chenoweth. Dr. Chenoweth along with three others moved into what we now call ‚ÄúOld Chenoweth‚Äù in 1930. The original focus of the department was to teach students and homemakers the technology of food preservation. This included apple, grape, maple and vinegar products that were sold to the public in a store in South Amherst. During this time Dr. Chenowth was quoted as being able to carry the entire library collection on Food Science under one arm. This led to Dr. Chenoweth publishing the first comprehensive textbook on Food Preservation.  Carl Fellers  In 1941, Dr. Carl R. Fellers became department head. The department continued working on community food preservation projects such as canning foods for the dining hall during World War II. Under Dr. Fellers guidance the department shifted its focus from community research and education to the scientific age of industrialization of food manufacturing. This transformation could be seen as the Food Technology curriculum shifted and as classes such as ‚ÄúHomemade Tomato Products‚Äù were replaced by courses such as ‚ÄúIndustrial Technology‚Äù. To reflect this change the department changed its name to the Department of Food Technology in 1944 as it expanded its interdisciplinary collaborations with faculty from Chemistry, Bacteriology, Dairy and Nutrition Departments. Dr. Carl Fellers' research program had a breadth that is unheard of today as his program covered chemistry, microbiology, nutrition and engineering. He provided numerous technological advances for the Massachusetts food industry especially with the seafood and cranberry producers. For example, he patented a process for canning and freezing shellfish to prevent discoloration and the proliferation of gritty, glass-like struvite by controlling pH and binding minerals. This invention was credited by the U.S. shrimp packing industry to have ‚Äúsolved two of the most serious outstanding problems of the canned shrimp industry and constitutes the greatest technical advance in 25 years.‚Äù Dr. Fellers also worked closely with cranberry growers in Massachusetts in an organization called ‚ÄúThe Cranberry Exchange‚Äù to produce safe, nutritious and great tasting products. Dr. Fellers also collaborated with the National Canners Association to assist with food plant sanitation, prevention of food spoilage and development of federal regulation. Some other areas of research he participated in included innovative packaging technologies, color and flavor retention in preserved foods, methods for the fortification of foods with vitamins and determination of the nutritive value of foods. Dr. Fellers was not only an incredibly productive faculty member but he was also active in Military service. During WWII he was stationed in Australia and is accredited for establishing 33 dehydration plants that provided dried milk and egg products to the troops. For this he was awarded the Bronze Star. In 1987, Dr. Fellers felt that‚ÄúThe challenge is to provide the shoulders on which the future investigator will stand and from which he, in turn, will peer beyond the present horizons of knowledge into the great unknown. That is the spirit of research.‚Äù Not only did Dr. Fellers have one of the top research programs in the world but he was also one of the founding fathers of food science. He was one of eight people to found the Institute of Food Technologists. While he was department head, he charged Dr. Guy Livingston with establishing the Food Science and Technology Honors Society, Phi Tau Sigma. Dr. Fellers loved working with students and was even known to personally support the University of Massachusetts degrees of underprivileged students from Amherst High School. IFT established the Carl R. Fellers Award to honor distinguished leaders in Food Science.  William Esselen  Dr. William Esselen joined the department in the early 1940s during which time he assisted with the World War II effort by spending two weeks each month as a technical consultant for the War Food Administration. Dr. Esselen directed research on war time food substitutes, canning, and other food preservation methods. He then joined the Quartermaster Corps to assess post war Germany‚Äôs food production capabilities. Dr. Esselen had a broad research program that focused on thermal processing, spore resistance, pickle technology, vitamin retention and packaging of cranberries. One of Esselen's most important scientific contributions was establishing the time-temperature relationships of vitamin destruction using the Arrhenius equation. This pioneering research established the basis for today's practice of utilizing high temperature-short time pasteurization to ensure food safety yet maximize nutrient retention. During Dr. Esselen tenure the department experienced tremendous growth and national recognition. For example, faculty member Irving Fagerson began working with the Consumers Union to establish the nutritive value and quality of a number of processed foods such as frozen broccoli (a relatively unknown crop at that time), canned soups and frozen dinners which began the era of consumer education on the quality of processed foods. During this time the department was one of the top research leaders on campus. To put this in perspective, in the sixteen years from 1945 to 1960, the department of Food Technology graduated 75 of the 140 Ph.D.'s produced by the entire university. This boom of interest in the field of food science and technology ultimately led to the appropriation of $1,650,000 to construct Chenoweth Laboratory. The department's name was changed to Food Science and Technology in order to reflect the changes in the department itself and to recognize the importance of basic sciences to the food industry.  Jack Francis  Following Dr. Esselen's tenure, Frederick Jack Francis became the head of the Department of Food Science. Dr. Francis had an array of research interests including food pigments and colorimetry, thermal processing, post- harvest physiology of fruits and vegetables and technical methods for increasing the food supply. Francis was a passionate individual and often wrote in support of food science and technology both in local and national publications. ‚ÄúWe cannot feed tomorrow's population with yesterday's technology.‚Äù Francis was also quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWhy is grain so important in world trade? Because it's nature‚Äôs way of preserving calories so we can eat them six months later. Well, that's essentially what processing and preservatives have done for the whole food supply. And I'm glad they have! Because I like to eat every day!‚Äù Francis was a realist and always approached ethical issues with a scientific light. ‚Äú‚ÄúAn individual may choose to adopt the organic food way for his/her own ethical and moral reasons. They are entitled, and Americans can afford it. But let no one be under the illusion that we can feed the population with the organic movement.‚Äù Dr. Francis's insights over 40 year ago are still the topic of numerous popular press debates today. Another example of Dr. Francis's amazing insights occurred upon working for Pfizer in the early 1960s. He was so impressed with their technology that he made a modest purchase in stock. Some 40 years later, he donated $1.5 million from this investment to establish the first endowed chair in the history of the University of Massachusetts Food Science Department.  Herbert O. Hultin  Herbert O. Hultin joined the University of Massachusetts Food Science Department after obtaining his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from MIT in three years. He spent half of his career in Amherst and the other half as the Director of the Marine Food Station in Gloucester, MA. His research included enzyme production of volatile flavors in fruits as well as protein and lipid biochemistry in fish products. Dr. Hultin was considered the founding father of Food Biochemistry by many of his colleagues. He presented the inaugural Food Chemistry Division Lectureship titled ‚ÄúFrom the Chemistry of Foods to Food Chemistry.‚Äù There he emphasized how food chemistry should be taught by integrating past research and new developments. His vision was to use the basic sciences to expand the multidisciplinary nature of Food Science, a concept that is prevalent in Food Science research today. Over the course of his life, Hultin received numerous awards. However, the one he was most proud of was the University of Wisconsin‚Äôs Professional Excellence Good Guy Award. This award offered recognition for a Professor that mentored numerous students with over 15 of his former graduates going onto successful careers as University professors. Herb Hultin‚Äôs legacy includes the Herbert Hultin Scholarship Award that is given annually to the top University of Massachusetts graduate student.  Charles Stumbo  Dr. Charles Stumbo was one of the world‚Äôs top Thermobacteriologists. He conducted ground breaking research on methods to determine thermal processing times to ensure food safety. His book entitled ‚ÄúThermobacteriology In Food Processing‚Äù contained process values for over 250,000 food processing operations. Dr. Stumbo also developed novel sterilization operations such as ethylene oxide and vapor phase sterilization. These techniques were used by NASA to sterilize space ships to avoid terrestrial organisms from contaminating extraterrestrial life. Dr. Stumbo's techniques decreased NASA's sterilization time from 23 hours to 90 seconds.  Fergus Clydesdale  Dr. Fergus Clydesdale was one of the most successful teachers in the history of the University of Massachusetts.Dr. Fergus M. Clydesdale . University of Massachusetts Amherst, retrieved April 22, 2011 Along with Dr. Francis, they developed Food Science 101, ‚ÄúThe Struggle for Food‚Äù. This class was the most popular courses of its time with over 1300 students per semester, reaching an estimated 15,000 during its time. His lectures were so popular that students attended the class and took the midterms even though many were not even enrolled. Dr. Clydesdale also had an illustrious research career as he was one of the ground breaking scientists to integrate the fields of Food Science, Nutrition and Public Policy. He was one of the leading Food Industry consultants providing expert advice for various projects such as one establishing the health benefits of whole grains. Dr. Clydesdale is currently the director of the University of Massachusetts Food Science Policy Alliance, the only such program in the U.S.. Dr. Clydesdale also selflessly gave his time to public service working with the National Academy of Science, Food and Drug Administration, International Life Sciences Institute and IFT. Dr. Clydesdale's excellence was recognized by receiving nearly every award given by the Institute of Food Technology. Dr. Clydesdale's tenure as department head was one of the most successful in University of Massachusetts history. He formed the first departmental advisory board which consisted of prominent alumni who had cut their teeth in the halls of Chenoweth. The Board and its two Chairs, Charlie Feldberg and Noel Anderson, have worked tirelessly with Dr. Clydesdale to develop strong Alumni relations by establishing a semi-annual newsletter, an Alumni weekend and an annual Alumni breakfast at the Institute of Food Technologies meeting. By establishing strong relations with Alumni, the Board was able to take a leadership roles in helping the department raise over $4.5 million in endowments. These endowments have been instrumental in the success of the department as they provide support for research, teaching and student scholarships Dr. Clydesdale in conjunction with the Advisory Board also initiated the Strategic Research Alliance, a partnership with over 30 major multinational food companies. This alliance provides critical research funding that was used to establish one of the top scientifically equipped food science departments in the world. In turn, the Research Alliance provided the industry with research innovations and access to some of the best young food scientists in the world.

The disease is characterized by a delayed leukoencephalopathy after a hypoxic episode. It is typically, though not necessarily, related to carbon monoxide poisoning or heroin overdose. It occurs in roughly 2.8% of those who experience an acute hypoxic/anoxic episode. Because of the wide range of symptoms and the delay in onset, it is often misdiagnosed as other neuropathologies. Grinker's myelinopathy was originally characterized by Roy R. Grinker in 1925H. Bour, Iain McAllan Ledingham, Iain McA. Ledingham (1967) Carbon Monoxide Poisoning. p.73Hideo H. Itabashi, MD, John M. Andrews, MD, Uwamie Tomiyasu, MD (2007) Forensic Neuropathology: A Practical Review of the Fundamentals. p.295 or 1926, depending on the source. Categorization Following an apparent rehabilitation from a severe episode of prolonged cerebral oxygen deprivation, patients with Grinker's myelinopathy begin to experience massive white matter death that leads to a wide range of neurological dysfunctions ranging from confusion and apathy to Parkinson-like symptoms. Symptoms The symptoms have been known to include apathy, dementia, Parkinsonism, agitation, urinary incontinence, and pseudobulbar palsy, among many other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Microscopically, extensive hemispheric demyelination and the degeneration of basal ganglia are observed. =Onset= The onset of the symptoms usually occurs several weeks after the initial hypoxic episode. The hypoxic episode is necessarily severe, usually with an arterial oxygen partial pressure less than 40mmHg. Following the severe hypoxia, the patient typically falls unconscious or into a coma, with the exception of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. If the patient recovers from this unconscious state, usually within 24 hours, it is typically followed by a successful recovery over a few days (generally 4 to 5). After the short recovery, a lucid period is observed, lasting anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks, in which the patient exhibits no symptoms related to the anoxic episode. It is after this period that the degenerative symptoms begin to appear and rapidly grow in severity. Causes The main cause of the neurological disorders is believed to be demyelination of the cerebral hemispheres, though there is currently no widely accepted consensus on why. The most commonly accepted theories for the cause of demyelination include hypoxia and cerebral edema due to carbon monoxide toxicity, drug overdose, or cerebral blood vessel damage, and a disruption of myelin-producing pathways. =Carbon monoxide toxicity= Because carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more efficiently than oxygen and lower systemic blood pressure brought upon by an acute anoxic episode in conjunction with carbon monoxide poisoning often leads to cerebral ischemia, a condition where the brain does not receive enough oxygen to satisfy its needs. This results in lesions to a great deal of subcortical cerebral white matter but leaves axons, U-fibers, and perivascular myelin mostly untouched. Support against this theory stems from the ability to replicate these lesions by using nitrogen- induced hypoxia and hypotension in cats and the onset of this disease in individuals who experienced acute hypoxia without carbon monoxide poisoning =Cerebral edema= Cerebral edema, or unusual swelling of the brain, is commonly caused by anoxic episodes. If it is severe enough, it is known to cause preferential damage to cerebral white matter due to excessive swelling of glial cells while leaving many other tissues unharmed. This theory suggests that hypoxia and carbon monoxide induce a form of edema resulting in white matter necrosis. Evidence for this theory comes from the observation of pathological lesions mimicking those of carbon monoxide poisoning where hypoxia and dehydration along with too-rapid rehydration have taken place without carbon monoxide present. =Disruption of myelin-creating pathways= The anoxic event is likely to cause damage to cytoplasmic ATP-dependent enzymes in oligodendrocytes. Because many of these enzymes play essential roles in myelin turnover, damage to these enzymes is thought to adversely affect the ability of the body to sustain myelin in white matter, leading to the demyelination of those areas of the brain. The inability to regenerate and remove myelin on certain cells is thought to be responsible for the delay in onset of the disease and for the specificity of the white matter death. Diagnosis Grinker's myelinopathy is diagnosed by establishing a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or other global cerebral hypoxic events. This diagnosis can then be supported by neuroimaging confirmation of broadcast cerebral hemisphere demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts. The neuroimaging evidence can also be used to diagnose Grinker's myelinopathy through an elevation in the concentrations of a myelin basic protein in the cerebrospinal fluid . Because this disease shares many of the symptoms with various forms of dementia or hysteria, these possibilities must be eliminated before a diagnosis for Grinker's myelinopathy can be made. =Neuroimaging= While there are no standard criteria for the diagnosis of Grinker's myelinopathy, neuroimaging can be an important diagnostic tool in ruling out other diagnoses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans can be used to demonstrate a decrease in white matter density in the patient's cerebral hemispheres, with the typical exception of overlying cortices. Unexplained, uniform demyelination of white matter can indicate acute onset Grinker's myelinopathy. Treatment Treatment Grinker's myelinopathy is still in the experimental stages and is very individualized. Some suggested treatments are early supportive care, rehabilitation therapies, oxygen treatments, and bed rest. Some episodes of Grinker's myelinopathy that progress to comas have no known treatment to reverse the course. Early supportive care is the anchor of treatment during the first two weeks. Rehabilitation is an important part of the care process and it is important to start the rehabilitation as soon as the patient is able to participate in therapy. Types of therapy include: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and respiratory therapy. This therapies are used to assess the patient's functional status and to develop treatment goals. Each goal is individualized to target the specific neurological impairments to improve the patient's functional abilities. One way to prevent the likelihood of Grinker's myelinopathy occurring is standard or hyperbaric oxygen after carbon monoxide poisoning. The hyperbaric oxygen treatment eliminates carbon dioxide from the brain, while the standard oxygen treatment normalizes carboxyhemoglobin levels. Another preventative measure one can take is to be on bed rest and abstain from stressful and strenuous procedures for the first 10 days after an extended hypoxic event. Expectation and recognition will also lead to an earlier and more accurate and appropriate use of health care services. Prognosis Those patients who survive initial hospitalization are likely to recover from Grinker's Myelinopathy, but may take up to a year or longer. Age seems to be a factor in the time for recovery, as one study indicated that the mean age of patients who recovered within one year was 10 years younger than that of patients who did not. For most patients, a recovery time of 3‚Äì6 months is typical. Even after recovering, however, some symptoms may persist, including cognitive deficits or Parkinsonian symptoms that can be treated separately.

Skanderbeg had been leading a war against the Ottoman Empire for over two decades and Ballaban Badera was an Ottoman captain of Albanian origin who had been recruited through the dev≈üirme system. Ballaban planned to catch Skanderbeg's camp in a surprise when he was away. Skanderbeg had been warned of the stratagem, however, and surrounded the Ottoman camp instead. When Ballaban ordered his army out, the Albanians ambushed and routed them. Ballaban returned a month later and the month afterwards, but was defeated both times. Background In April 1465, Ballaban Badera, an Ottoman sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid of Albanian origin, had been defeated at the Battle of Vaikal by Skanderbeg, although at a great cost. Skanderbeg had been leading a war against the Ottoman Empire for over twenty years. Ballaban was favored by Sultan Mehmed II who saw that a native Albanian would be useful in defeating an Albanian rebellion. Ballaban's appointment was a calculated act of social revolution, encouraging other Albanians to join the Ottoman army. In July 1465, Mehmed assigned Ballaban to an army with which to invade Albania. Campaign Before the campaign, Ballaban presented Skanderbeg with expensive gifts. Skanderbeg responding by giving Ballaban a pickaxe and a plow to remind Ballaban of his peasant origins. Ballaban, in return for the gift he had received, tried to finish the campaign as quickly as he could. Ballaban tried to bribe an Albanian camp in Me√ßad, near Oranik, but Skanderbeg, who had been farther north, was warned of the movements and returned to fight Ballaban. He marched in through Ohrid. Ballaban was not aware of Skanderbeg's return and still prepared for the attack. Skanderbeg had surrounded the Turkish in Me√ßad and when Ballaban ordered his attack, he found himself surrounded. On one side, they were attacked by the Albanian cavalry and on the other, by the Italian volunteers. Aftermath The Albanians won a decisive victory. Turkish flags fell into Albanian hands and few escaped. Ballaban returned to Constantinople and Mehmed thus assigned him to an army of 20,000 which was again defeated by Skanderbeg in July 1465. In August, Ballaban launched his largest campaign against Albania. The Ottoman army consisted of 40,000 men altogether, but it too was defeated by Skanderbeg. The next year, however, Mehmed launched a total war against Albanian arms, completely devastating the country and laying siege to Kruj√´.

Life  Catherine was the only daughter and second child of the Duke Henry I of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (‚Ä† 1416) from his first marriage to Sophie (‚Ä† June 1400), daughter of Duke Wartislaw VI of Pomerania. As a 7-year-old she married on 7 February 1402 Margrave Frederick IV \\"the Warlike\\" of Meissen (1370‚Äì1428), who in 1425 became the first Elector of Saxony, as Frederick I. The elector lost a large part of his army in the Hussite Wars in a battle in 1425 at Most. During Frederick's absence, Electress Catherine organized another army of 20,000 men, which rushed to Frederick's aid, but was defeated devastatingly in the Battle of Aussig in 1426. Catherine spent time with her husband, but more frequently alone, at Mildenstein Castle in Leisnig, which thereby developed into a private residence of the Saxon Electors.

Location  The castle is located on a hard sandstone slab, 140 metres above the Polenz valley and is the major landmark of the small town.  History  Coat of arms of the Berka of Dub√° and Lipa over the entrancweay to the second courtyard Hohnstein Castle was probably built around 1200 or earlier as a Bohemian border fortress for the Margravate of Mei√üen to defend it against Saxony. In 1353 the castle went into the possession of the Bohemian nobleman, Hynek Berka z Dub√©, whose coat of arms with crossed oak branches decorates the entranceway to the second courtyard. In 1443 the Berkas of Dub√° lost the estate through exchanges and purchase, only mentioned for the first time under their name, to the Electorate of Saxony under Frederick the Humble, although it remained a Bohemian fief until 1806. The Wettins used it as a base for hunting and for salmon spearing (Lachsstechen). In the succeeding centuries the castle acted alternately as a seat of administration (electoral Amt), a court and a prison. The original wooden structures were gradually replaced during the 17th and 18th centuries by the present stone buildings and even successfully withstood a Swedish siege in 1639. After the dissolution of the Amt in 1861 the castle served as a men's correctional institute (M√§nnerkorrektionsanstalt) and from 1919 as a juvenile prison. In 1925 the mighty castle became a youth hostel (Jugendburg) and was one of the largest and most attractive youth hostels in Germany (with about 1,000 bedspaces). The Hohnsteiner Kasper puppet theatre is named after the town and castle and put on its first performance in 1928 in the castle. In the years 1933/34 a concentration camp was established here for so-called protective custody prisoners (Schutzh√§ftlinge), in practice 5,600 political prisoners.Lothar Gruchmann: Justiz im Dritten Reich. 3. verb. Aufl. Munich, 2001, , p. 369-374 During World War II a prisoner of war camp was housed in the castle and, after the war it was a refuge for displaced persons. From 1949 it was extended to become the largest youth hostel in the GDR; at the end of the SED rule an internment camp for 890 political opponents was planned. In 1953 the National Science Museum for Geology, Botany, Zoology and Ecology of the countryside was established here. In 1997 the castle was turned into a Friends of Nature house and youth guest house, to which the museum belongs today.  Site  Access to the castle is only possible from the market square (Marktplatz) in Hohnstein.

Wallengren was born in Lund where he would spend most of his short life. His father M√•rten Svensson (1831-1898) was the poor son of a peasant who had managed to work his way up to a respectable position as a local civil servant, and his mother Olivia Wallengren (1842-1879) was the daughter of a clergyman. Although the latter died of tuberculosis when young Axel was only fourteen and his many siblings even younger, he seems to have had a fairly harmonious middle-class childhood. After having attended the local gymnasium Katedralskolan, Wallengren enrolled as a student at Lund University in 1883. At first he studied diligently and received a degree as Bachelor of Arts in 1886. After this he entered the faculty of law - probably mainly as a result of his father's ambitions - but from then on his literary and other interests would take the upper hand of him, and he never fulfilled this part of his education.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands on a hillside to the south of the village, some east of Basingstoke. History The church was built in the 13th century by the nuns of Wintney Priory. At this time it consisted of a nave and a chancel. The transepts and the tower were added in the middle of the 19th century. St Mary's was replaced as the parish church when a new church dedicated to Saint John was built in the village, and St Mary's became a mortuary chapel. The church was declared redundant on 13 March 1974 and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 22 October 1975. Architecture =Exterior= The nave and chancel are constructed in flint with some puddingstone and brick. The transepts are in red brick, and the tower is in flint. The church is roofed with red tiles. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel, with north and south transepts, and a west tower. The chancel measures by , the nave by , the transepts by , and the tower is square. The windows in the sides of the chancel and nave date from the 14th and 15th centuries, and have one, two or three lights. The windows in the transepts, and the three-light east window, date from the 19th century. The tower is in three stages with diagonal corner buttresses. In the bottom stage is a west door, and a single-light window on the north and south sides. The middle stage contains two-light windows on the north, west and south sides, and in the top stage are three-light bell openings an all sides. At the top of the tower is an embattled parapet with a pinnacle at each corner. =Interior= In the chancel is a 12th-century piscina, and a hagioscope (squint).

His first novel, published in 1935, was the autobiographical Call Back Yesterday. Goodwin's most acclaimed work, The Heyday in the Blood, appeared in 1936, and his last novel, Come Michaelmas, appeared in 1939. In 1975, The Heyday in the Blood was translated into Welsh. Biography He was born in the village of Llanllwchaearn, on the outskirts of Newtown, Montgomeryshire , the son of Richard Goodwin (1862‚Äì1911) and Mary Jane (Watkin, n√©e Lewis) Goodwin (1862‚Äì1943). His father died when he was eight, and his mother married the almost twenty years younger Frank Humphreys when he was twelve. This marriage was his mother's third and Humphreys' second. Goodwin apparently got on well with his stepfather, and Frank Humphreys', and his mother's, love for the outdoors - especially fishing and rough shooting - were an important influence on him. He attended Tywyn County School as a boarder at the age of thirteen, and when he left school, he initially worked on The Montgomeryshire Express. Then in 1923, he moved to London to work in a News Agency and later as a reporter for The Daily Sketch. Goodwin's stepfather had two sons, around Goodwin's age, who had become journalists.. In 1930 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and spent several months in a sanitorium. Then in October 1932 he married a fellow journalist from Yorkshire, Rhoda Storey (1902‚Äì1991).Sam Adams, \\"Goodwin, Geraint Arthur (1903‚Äì1941)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.; Out of his experience of TB came his first novel, the autobiographical Call Back Yesterday (1935). The success of this novel led to Cape offering him a contract for two further books and Goodwin and his family moved to Hertfordshire and he became a full-time writer. Following Goodwin's Call Back Yesterday in 1936 came his most acclaimed work, The Heyday in the Blood. This novel contrasts the old and declining ways of a village on the Welsh Border with new ways of England, where many migrate, and is a vibrant work of both tragedy and farcical comedy. In 1938 they moved to Corris Uchaf, near Machynlleth, where Goodwin wrote his last novel Come Michaelmas (1939), which is set in a barely disguised Newtown. The same year he became ill again and spent sometime in the sanitarium at Talgarth, on the edge of The Black Mountains. While the family moved to Montgomery, Montgomeryshire, Geraint Goodwin's health continued to deteriorate and he died aged 38 from tuberculosis in Montgomery, survived by his wife and a son and a daughter.

Ghana, an African country with a population of more than 25 million,statsghana.gov.gh. statsghana.gov.gh. like all countries in the world has many markets. Some being major and others being minor. Unlike markets in other countries across the planet, Ghanaian markets are unique. Their uniqueness lies in the fact one would hardly find a market that trades in one particular group of wares. In a typical Ghanaian market one can find everything from apples to zoot suits. History of markets Trading in the country begun when the first settles arrived in the country. Like many countries in Africa, the main method of trading was through the barter system. People used to exchange goods and services for commodities and services that was believed to measure up to what was being offered. As trade became more liberalized, people used to trade their goods and services for cowries known locally as \\"cedie. This later became the country's currency - the cedi. Supermarkets The Accra Mall remains Ghana's prime supermarket, the mall which started operations in the 2008The Accra mall one of the most modern shopping malls . accramall.com. sought to improve the Ghanaian's shopping experience. It is located on the Spintex road adjacent the Tema Motorway. Another big supermarket in the country is Melcom.melcomgroup.com - melcolm . melcomgroup.com. The company was established in 1989. In 1991, the primary shop was opened in Accra Central. It has branches in almost all regions of the country including the single largest shop in the nation - Melcom Plus in Kaneshie, covering an area of over 90,000 square feet. Internet trading Some amount of trading is done online though this is not widespread. The major online trading sites are: *theflipbay.com *bayGH.com *mallgh.com None of these sites are currently still doing business in 2018 Street markets There are ten administrative regions in Ghana with each having its own regional capital. Every region has at least one major street market where peculiar goods and services offered at minor street markets would be readily available and at a cheaper price. Some of the major street markets in the country are: *Kotokoraba Market in Cape Coast - Central region *Market Circle in Takoradi - Western region *Kejetia in Kumasi - Ashanti region *Kantamanto in Accra - Greater Accra region *Makola Market in Accra - Greater Accra region *Kintampo market in Kintampo - Brong-Ahafo region *Tamale central market in Tamale - Northern region *Kaneshie market in Kaneshie - Greater Accra region *Bantama in Kumasi - Ashanti region *Tafo in Kumasi - Ashanti region Fire outbreaks in markets One common issue that Ghanaian markets face is the problem of market fires. These are rampant and the effect, typically, is that goods and structures are destroyed with the cost running into thousands of cedis. These fire outbreaks start from varied sources, that is, they may start as a result of an unattended iron, coal pot fire not turned out to wielders forgetting to turn off their wielding torches. The problem is always compounded because of congestion. Every major market in Ghana faces the problem of congestion. Due to this, fire hydrants have been obscured by stalls, lanes that fire trucks could use to access the market are converted into stores etc. All these come together to cause the kind of destruction that occurs during such outbreaks of fires.

It gives an expression for the wave disturbance when a monochromatic spherical wave passes through an opening in an opaque screen. The equation is derived by making several approximations to the Kirchhoff integral theorem which uses Green's theorem to derive the solution to the homogeneous wave equation. Derivation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula Kirchhoff's integral theorem, sometimes referred to as the Fresnel‚ÄìKirchhoff integral theorem, uses Green's identities to derive the solution to the homogeneous wave equation at an arbitrary point P in terms of the values of the solution of the wave equation and its first order derivative at all points on an arbitrary surface which encloses P. The solution provided by the integral theorem for a monochromatic source is: :U(P) = frac{1}{4pi} int_{S} left[ U frac{partial}{partial n} left( frac{e^{iks}}{s} right) - frac{e^{iks}}{s} frac{partial U}{partial n} right]dS, where U is the complex amplitude of the disturbance at the surface, k is the wavenumber, and s is the distance from P to the surface. The assumptions made are: * U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn are discontinuous at the boundaries of the aperture, * the distance to the point source and the dimension of opening S are much greater than Œª. =Point source= Geometrical arrangement used in deriving Kirchhhoff's diffraction formula Consider a monochromatic point source at P0, which illuminates an aperture in a screen. The energy of the wave emitted by a point source falls off as the inverse square of the distance traveled, so the amplitude falls off as the inverse of the distance. The complex amplitude of the disturbance at a distance r is given by :U(r) = frac{a e^{ikr}}{r}, where a represents the magnitude of the disturbance at the point source. The disturbance at a point P can be found by applying the integral theorem to the closed surface formed by the intersection of a sphere of radius R with the screen. The integration is performed over the areas A1, A2 and A3, giving :U(P) = frac{1}{4pi} left[int_{A_1} + int_{A_2} + int_{A_3} left( U frac{partial}{partial n} left( frac{e^{iks}}{s} right) - frac{e^{iks}}{s} frac{partial U}{partial n} right)right] dS. To solve the equation, it is assumed that the values of U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn in the area A1 are the same as when the screen is not present, giving at Q: :U_{A_1} = frac{a e^{ikr}}{r}, :frac{partial U_{A_1}}{partial n} = frac{ae^{ikr}}{r} left[ik - frac{1}{r} right] cos(n,r), where r is the length P0Q, and (n, r) is the angle between P0Q and the normal to the aperture. Kirchhoff assumes that the values of U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn in A2 are zero. This implies that U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn are discontinuous at the edge of the aperture. This is not the case, and this is one of the approximations used in deriving the equation.J.Z. Buchwald & C.-P. Yeang, \\"Kirchhoff's theory for optical diffraction, its predecessor and subsequent development: the resilience of an inconsistent theory\\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.70, no.5 (Sep.2016), pp.463‚Äì511; .J. Saatsi & P. Vickers, \\"Miraculous success? Inconsistency and untruth in Kirchhoff‚Äôs diffraction theory\\", British J. for the Philosophy of Science, vol.62, no.1 (March 2011), pp. 29‚Äì46; jstor.org/stable/41241806. (Pre-publication version, with different pagination: dro.dur.ac.uk/10523/1/10523.pdf.) These assumptions are sometimes referred to as Kirchhoff's boundary conditions. The contribution from A3 to the integral is also assumed to be zero. This can be justified by making the assumption that the source starts to radiate at a particular time, and then by making R large enough, so that when the disturbance at P is being considered, no contributions from A3 will have arrived there. Such a wave is no longer monochromatic, since a monochromatic wave must exist at all times, but that assumption is not necessary, and a more formal argument avoiding its use has been derived.M. Born, Optik: ein Lehrbuch der elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie. Berlin, Springer, 1933, reprinted 1965, p. 149. We have : frac{partial}{partial n} left( frac{e^{iks}}{s} right) = frac{e^{iks}}{s} left[ik - frac{1}{s} right] cos(n,s), where (n, s) is the angle between the normal to the aperture and PQ. Note that in this derivation (n, s)>œÄ/2 and cos(n, s) is negative. Finally, the terms 1/r and 1/s are assumed to be negligible compared with k, since r and s are generally much greater than 2œÄ/k, which is equal to the wavelength. Thus, the integral above, which represents the complex amplitude at P, becomes :U(P) = -frac{ia}{2lambda} int_{A_1} frac{e^{ik(r+s)}}{rs} [cos(n,r) - cos(n,s)], d{A_1}. This is the Kirchhoff or Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction formula. Equivalence to Huygens‚ÄìFresnel equation Geometric arrangement used to express Kirchhoff's formula in a form similar to Huygens‚ÄìFresnel The Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle can be derived by integrating over a different closed surface. The area A1 above is replaced by a wavefront from P0, which almost fills the aperture, and a portion of a cone with a vertex at P0, which is labeled A4 in the diagram. If the radius of curvature of the wave is large enough, the contribution from A4 can be neglected. We also have :chi = pi - (r_0,s), where œá is as defined in Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, and cos(n, r) = 1. The complex amplitude of the wavefront at r0 is given by :U(r_0) = frac{ae^{ikr_0}}{r_0}. The diffraction formula becomes :U(P) = -frac{i}{2lambda} frac{ae^{ikr_0}}{r_0} int_{S} frac{e^{iks}}{s} (1 + coschi),dS. This is the Kirchhoff's diffraction formula, which contains parameters that had to be arbitrarily assigned in the derivation of the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel equation. =Extended source= Assume that the aperture is illuminated by an extended source wave.M. V. Klein & T. E. Furtak, 1986, Optics; 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York . The complex amplitude at the aperture is given by U0(r). It is assumed, as before, that the values of U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn in the area A1 are the same as when the screen is not present, that the values of U and ‚àÇU/‚àÇn in A2 are zero (Kirchhoff's boundary conditions) and that the contribution from A3 to the integral are also zero. It is also assumed that 1/s is negligible compared with k. We then have :U(P) = frac{1}{4pi} int_{A_1} frac{e^{iks}}{s} left[ ik U_0(r) cos(n,s) - frac{partial U_0(r)}{partial n} right], dS. This is the most general form of the Kirchhoff diffraction formula. To solve this equation for an extended source, an additional integration would be required to sum the contributions made by the individual points in the source. If, however, we assume that the light from the source at each point in the aperture has a well-defined direction, which is the case if the distance between the source and the aperture is significantly greater than the wavelength, then we can write : U_0(r) approx a(r) e^{ikr}, where a(r) is the magnitude of the disturbance at the point r in the aperture. We then have : frac{partial {U_0(r)}}{partial n} = ik a(r) cos(n,r) and thus :U(P) = -frac{i}{2lambda} int_S a(r) frac{e^{iks}}{s} [ coschi + cos(n,r)], dS. Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction equations In spite of the various approximations that were made in arriving at the formula, it is adequate to describe the majority of problems in instrumental optics. This is mainly because the wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of any obstacles encountered. Analytical solutions are not possible for most configurations, but the Fresnel diffraction equation and Fraunhofer diffraction equation, which are approximations of Kirchhoff's formula for the near field and far field, can be applied to a very wide range of optical systems. One of the important assumptions made in arriving at the Kirchhoff diffraction formula is that r and s are significantly greater than Œª. Another approximation can be made, which significantly simplifies the equation further: this is that the distances P0Q and QP are much greater than the dimensions of the aperture. This allows one to make two further approximations: * cos(n, r) ‚àí cos(n, s) is replaced with 2cos Œ≤, where Œ≤ is the angle between P0P and the normal to the aperture. The factor 1/rs is replaced with 1/r's, where r and s are the distances from P0 and P to the origin, which is located in the aperture. The complex amplitude then becomes: ::U(P) = -frac{ia cosbeta}{lambda r's'} int_S e^{ik(r+s)},ds. * Assume that the aperture lies in the xy plane, and the coordinates of P0, P and Q (a general point in the aperture) are (x0, y0, z0), (x, y, z) and (x, y, 0) respectively. We then have: :: ~r^2 = (x_0 - x')^2 + (y_0 - y')^2 + z_0^2, :: ~s^2 = (x - x')^2 + (y - y')^2 + z^2, :: ~r'^2 = x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2, :: ~s'^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2. We can express r and s as follows: :r = r'left[1 - frac{2(x_0x' + y_0y')}{r'^2} + frac{x'^2 + y'^2}{r'^2}right]^{1/2}, :s = s'left[1 - frac{2(xx' + yy')}{s'^2} + frac{x'^2 + y'^2}{s'^2}right]^{1/2}. These can be expanded as power series: :r = r'left[1 - frac{1}{2r'^2}[2(x_0x' + y_0y') + (x'^2 + y'^2)] + frac{1}{2r'^2}[2(x_0x' + y_0y') + (x'^2 + y'^2)]^2 + cdotsright], :s = s'left[1 - frac{1}{2s'^2}[2(xx' + yy') + (x'^2 + y'^2)] + frac{1}{2s'^2}[2(xx' + yy') + (x'^2 + y'^2)]^2 + cdotsright]. The complex amplitude at P can now be expressed as :U(P) = -frac{icosbeta}{lambda} frac{ae^{ik(r' + s')}}{r's'} int_S e^{ikf(x',y')}, dx' dy', where f(x, y) includes all the terms in the expressions above for s and r apart from the first term in each expression and can be written in the form :f(x',y') = c_1 x' + c_2 y' + c_3 x'^2 + c_4 y'^2 + c_5x'y' cdots, where the ci are constants. = Fraunhofer diffraction = If all the terms in f(x, y) can be neglected except for the terms in x and y, we have the Fraunhofer diffraction equation. If the direction cosines of P0Q and PQ are :begin{align} l_0 &= -x_0/r',  m_0 &= -y_0/r',  l &= x/s',  m &= y/s'. end{align} The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is then :U(P) = Cint_S e^{ik[(l_0 - l)x' + (m_0 - m)y']}, dx' dy', where C is a constant. This can also be written in the form :U(P) = Cint_S e^{i(mathbf k_0 - mathbf k) cdot mathbf r'}, dr', where k0 and k are the wave vectors of the waves traveling from P0 to the aperture and from the aperture to P respectively, and r is a point in the aperture. If the point source is replaced by an extended source whose complex amplitude at the aperture is given by U0(r' ), then the Fraunhofer diffraction equation is: :U(P) propto int_S a_0 (mathbf r') e^{i(mathbf k_0 - mathbf k) cdot mathbf r'}, dr', where a0(r') is, as before, the magnitude of the disturbance at the aperture. In addition to the approximations made in deriving the Kirchhoff equation, it is assumed that * r and s are significantly greater than the size of the aperture, * second- and higher-order terms in the expression f(x, y) can be neglected. = Fresnel diffraction = When the quadratic terms cannot be neglected but all higher order terms can, the equation becomes the Fresnel diffraction equation. The approximations for the Kirchhoff equation are used, and additional assumptions are: * r and s are significantly greater than the size of the aperture, * third- and higher-order terms in the expression f(x, y) can be neglected.

Experiments on a Thermus thermophilus protein with this domain () shows that artificial substrates can be alternatively used for a modified absorption spectra. It naturally binds FMN in a pose similar to 8-HDF. In addition, many cryptochromes, especially those from animals, bind no cofactors at this domain. Even though few eukaryotes (and no animals) can synthesize 8-HDF on their own, many lineages nevertheless use deazaflavin photolyases. They probably receive 8-HDF from their endosymbiotic microbes. Unlike many bacterial deazaflavin photolyases that accepts FMN as well as 8-HDF, one such enzyme from the fruit fly only accepts 8-HDF. The FeS-BCP N-terminal domain is homologous to this domain.

Fung 1996 Such conditions occur rarely in industrial applications but are very common in biological studies such as blood flow in veins and air flow in lungs. When a flow is driven through a deformable channel or tube, interactions between fluid-mechanical and elastic forces can lead to a variety of biologically significant phenomena, including nonlinear pressure-drop/flow-rate relations, wave propagation, and the generation of instabilities. Understanding the physical origin and nature of these phenomena remains a significant experimental, analytical, and computational challenge, involving unsteady flows at low or high Reynolds numbers, large-amplitude fluid-structure interactions, free-surface flows, and intrinsically 2D or 3D motion. Whereas frequently the internal flow involves a single fluid phase (albeit often of a complex biological fluid such as blood), in many instances the presence of two or more distinct flowing phases is of primary importance (as is the case for air-liquid flows in peripheral lung airways, for example).Annu. Rev.

ASME 121:557‚Äì64 partial vessel collapse occurs in vessels which undergo conditions of higher external pressure relative to the fluid within and can be difficult to predict mathematically. As such, devices such as a Starling Resistor are often used to predict fluid flow under these conditions. Fluid is forced through an elastically deforming tube which passes through a region of high external pressure causing a flattening of the tube depending on the relative pressures of the inside and outside of the tube. In the absence of any flow (puD pd), an increase in pe generates a compressive stress in the tube wall causing it to buckle from a circular to an elliptic cross-section (except, of course, near its ends, where it is attached to the rigid tubes). Buckling to a shape with more than two lobes may arise in short, tethered, or inhomogeneous tubes. Once buckled, the tube becomes highly compliant so that small additional increases in pe lead to a substantial reduction in cross-sectional area ¬Æ. Further compression leads to contact of the opposite tube walls, first at a point, and then along a line (Figure 2, left); once in opposite-wall contact, the tube's compliance falls because strong bending forces in the tube wall at the bulbous end of each lobe provide an increasing resistance to area reductions.

The song serves as the opening track of the album, and was written by West, Ernest Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Mike Dean and Robert Diggs. It features an opening narrative delivered by rapper Nicki Minaj, and singers Teyana Taylor and Justin Vernon contribute to the song's hook and provide background vocals. The track heavily samples \\"In High Places\\" by Mike Oldfield (sung by Jon Anderson). The song introduces several of the themes presented on the album and features numerous pop culture references, a gospel-inspired production style, and piano-driven composition. The song received acclaim from music critics, who praised the song as a strong opener to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, complementing West's vocal delivery and the song's production. Despite not being released as a single, the hype generated by the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy caused the song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 at position 60. It was the opening song of West's 2011 setlist at the Coachella Music Festival, and was performed at the 'Vevo Presents GOOD Music' musical venue. \\"Dark Fantasy\\" was utilized during the opening sequence of West's short film Runaway, during an extended scene with West driving down an atmospheric forest.

It is claimed to be the oldest surviving family home in Lancashire. Since 1954, it has been designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. History In the fourteenth century, Edmund Parker was park-keeper of Radholme Laund, west of Browsholme, one of the two great deer parks in the Forest of Bowland. In 1393, his sons Richard and John were deputy parkers of Radholme, but from 1380, they had a lease of the vaccary (mediaeval cattle farm) of Browsholme. Richard probably built the original house on the present site around that time. Browsholme Hall Lodge When in 1507, King Henry VII disafforested Bowland, Edmund Parker obtained a copyhold of Nether Browsholme and began the present house. Thomas Parker, purchased the freehold of Browsholme from the Crown in 1603 and further improved the house, which had been enlarged by his father. His grandson, also called Thomas, is believed to have added a formal garden in 1674. On the death of his father, John Parker in 1797, Thomas Lister Parker succeeded to the Browsholme estate. In 1804 and 1805, he made alterations to the Hall, rebuilding the west wing, and afterwards he made additions under the superintendence of Sir Jeffry Wyatville. He had a taste for landscape gardening, and between 1797 and 1810, spent large sums in laying the grounds. In the house, he displayed a collection of antiquities and pictures, partly formed by himself. He had a large series of drawings and prints bought during a tour on the continent in 1800 and 1801, at Moscow, Venice, and Paris; a large collection of drawings of castles and manor-houses by John Chessell Buckler, and portfolios of his own drawings. He also possessed pictures of the Flemish school and works of James Northcote and Thomas Gainsborough. Thomas Lister Parker ultimately bankrupted himself and was forced to pass the estate to a cousin. Robert Goulbourne Parker repaired Browsholme in 1958 with the aid of the Historic Buildings Council, and from 1957, opened the house to the public, giving personally guided tours. In 2010, the present owners Robert and Amanda Parker, restored the 17th-century tithe barn for use as an event space. In April 2015 Amanda Parker became High Sheriff of Lancashire.

The agent or business needs qualifications in the building industry and must understand the \\"Standards Australia\\" building contracts. As there is no independent watch dog it is vital to request evidence of their qualifications to advise before engaging a broker. The Building Broker can specialise in either all, or one of, the building types: residential, commercial or industrial.  Origin  The term originally referred to a person responsible for brokering the construction of a building on real estate. While this is closely related to the work of Estate Agents, greater knowledge of the building process is essential. The job of the Building Broker is to know the construction method of the proposed design along with the current economic pricing structure of that type of construction and local factors that either increase or decrease the value of the construction. Without suitable qualifications you are essentially asking someone to negotiate for you on a subject in which they are not an expert, with the inevitable problems that will entail. Their employees should also be suitably qualified to assist as a broker is also required to know the current and projected economic factors for the local areas.  Regulation  Within the states of Australia, Builder Brokers have no specific authority to report to or obtain specific licences. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the body which regulates all registered companies and associations. It is highly recommended to confirm that your building broker is suitably qualified as it is common for sales people to start a brokerage with very little building knowledge. It would be like going to a witch doctor for medical advice to choose a building broker who isn't actually a suitably qualified building professional, preferably a registered builder.  Industrial Structure  Within Australia there is only a handful of national brokering firms in existence, such as Home Builders Advantage Australia's Biggest Building broker, Australian Home Renovations, Home Builders Australia, Placeme and Clear Build, with most being regional or area specialists. Only a handful of brokerage firms handle commercial and residential quoting services with Place me and Home Builders Australia being the oldest. Specialists exist in each state or major city and can often be more competitive, with their local knowledge of the industry. The Building Broker services typically include everything from the initial site survey to creation of the home design; then qualifying builders and managing the tender process to ensure client satisfaction. Typically, savings can be achieved in excess of 10% when compared to the traditional method of purchasing a new home by way of display homes. Clear Build, as an example, does not draw its own plans, but utilizes the customers plans, forcing builders into a competitive environment to ensure your plans are priced fairly, with significant savings possible. it is wise to select the building broker that has full time staff to assist with all phases of the project from deisgn until completion. Too many contractors involved will only add to your overall costs and will become an issue should problems occur with no central point of redress. Placeme differs from the standard procedure, and provides the tools that the builder brokers use to facilitate the brokering process nationally in Australia, as well as providing the Builder Brokering service on their website.  Fees  Brokerage fees are typically found to be charged to the contractor to whom the work is being contracted. In some other cases there can be a smaller engagement fee charged to the client, which is mostly non-refundable and typically between $300AUD-$500AUD, plus Goods and Service Tax (GST). This sort of pre-payment fee is typical in larger commercial projects. There is no standard set fee allocated to the services of Builder Brokers to charge contractors. Typically the fees from contractors are between 3% to 5% of the total cost of the wholesale build price. It is worth noting that the lager the building broker the more significant the savings available therefore a small brokerage will have very little negotiating power on your behalf and may in fact actually cost you more.

Throughout its life under the management of different owners, it has been, in chronological order, a family mansion, a time period hotel, a union summer camp, and a five-star hotel. El Castillo Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels Worldwide.  History  Farmhouse of Las Playas Estancia, 1870. Monte Olivo Hotel, 1930. The castle was built as the primary farmhouse of the \\"Las Playas\\" estancia around 1870, in the town of Valle Hermoso, C√≥rdoba Provincia de C√≥rdoba, Argentine Republic. At the beginnings of the 20th century, the farmhouse was expanded, while conserving its medieval Florentine style, and turned into the luxurious \\"Hotel Monte Olivo\\", beautified with floors of granite and parquet, cedar and cinchona cabinetry, Provence furniture, porcelain and silver tableware, bronze bathroom fittings, and wrought iron light fixtures. In the 1930s, the castle passed to the hands of the Italian immigrant Don Jos√© Ferrarini , who, a few years later, closed its doors and the building was kept unused for more than thirty years. From 1970 to 2000, the property was used as a summer camp for the metal workers union (\\"Uni√≥n Obrera Metal√∫rgica\\"), and was allotted to student and senior tourism operators. The last years of this phase, EL CASTILLO remained impossible to use due to the deterioration suffered by neglect, lack of maintenance and repeated looting. In 2002, the castle regained its historical value thanks to a four-year restoration, carried out entirely by local workers and craftsmen led by an Argentine family. Since 2006, under the name of ‚ÄúEl Castillo Hotel F√°brega Organizational Center‚Äù it operates as a hotel specialized in family tourism, corporate events and training programs.  Architecture  El Castillo has 7000 square metres and four hectares of grounds. In the different modules, the building combines materials such as stone, brick, fine plaster, solid wood, and wrought iron. The windows and doors are straight lines, but are marked with stone arches. The upper finishing has a jagged shape with battlements, and in every angle there are watchtowers. The roofs have flat terraces and inclined surfaces with Spanish tiles. It has 45 rooms of up to 90 square metres.  Categorization  On March 22, 2010, El Castillo was officially recognized as a five-star hotel by the C√≥rdoba Tourism Agency. It is the first 5 star hotel in the Sierras of C√≥rdoba and the only in the province outside of the capital.  Case Study and Academic Participation  El Castillo is the first South American hotel that has been analysed by the international academic community. The case study, written by Emeritus Professor Jonathan Story and certified by the INSEAD and RPI Universities, describes how it was possible to create a product that was previously non- existent, that combines family tourism and business training, all while obtaining record numbers of growth and client satisfaction. The analysis shows special emphasis on the high risk that the entrepreneurial family had to overcome, with obstacles such as the profound economic crisis (the December 2001 Crisis in Argentina), lack of credit, remote vendors, expensive technology, changing context, devalued location, and laws contrary to ecotourism. El Castillo has been invited by various universities to present their vision and commitment as a responsible social actor.

The lake has an area of 54 acres and a maximum depth of 11 feet. Its average surface elevation is about 800 feet above sea level. History Lake Chaffee was formed sometime prior to 1934 by damming a small stream named Chaffee Brook. Before the dam was built, wetlands existed where the pond is now. Description Lake Chaffee's inflows consist of several intermittent small streams and runoff, and its outlet is Chaffee Brook, which flows into the Mount Hope River. The lake's waters are held back by a 300-foot earthen dam; Chaffee Brook exits the lake via a ten-foot long concrete spillway in the middle of this dam. Lake Chaffee's watershed is approximately 284 acres in area. It takes nearly six months for the lake's water to be completely exchanged. The lake has approximately 8,400 feet of shoreline, disregarding the lake's two islands. Development Today, Lake Chaffee is surrounded by a high-density area of houses which overlook the water. Recreation Lake Chaffee is home to two beaches and a boat launch, which are open to lake residents. Swimming, fishing, canoeing, kayaking and skating are popular activities on the lake. Use of gasoline-powered engines is not permitted on, over, or above Lake Chaffee. Flora and fauna Lake Chaffee is an excellent fishery, with a healthy population of largemouth bass, black crappie, chain pickerel, and yellow perch. The largemouth bass average in the 2 pound class, with larger fish in the 4 to 6 pound class being common.http://www.lakechaffee.org/fishing.php Lake Chaffee is also home to abundant aquatic vegetation, which occasionally must be harvested to enable recreational activities.

His Book and his arrest  Teyou is notable for his book La Belle de la r√©publique banani√®re : Chantal Biya, de la rue au palais (English: \\"The Beauty of the Banana Republic: Chantal Biya, from the Streets to the Palace\\"), where he traces Mrs. Biya's rise from ordinary origins to become the First Lady of Cameroon. He was imprisoned on charges of insulting Chantal Biya, the wife of President Paul Biya in his book and for trying to hold a public reading of this book. On 3 November 2010, Teyou was arrested at a hotel in Douala where he had organized a book signing; copies of his book were seized and destroyed. On 10 November, he was tried by the High Court (Tribunal de premi√®re instance) in Douala and found guilty of \\"insult to character\\" and organizing an \\"illegal demonstration\\". The court sentenced him to two years‚Äô imprisonment or a fine of 2,030,150 CFA francs (approximately 4,425 US dollars). Because he could not pay the fine, he began serving his sentence in New Bell Prison in Douala. The Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN protested his trial and called for his immediate release. Amnesty International considered him to be a prisoner of conscience.  Hunger strike, imprisonment and release  In February 2011, Teyou went on hunger strike to protest conditions in New Bell. On 8 March 2011, Le Jour reported that Teyou had been hospitalized. Amnesty International also issued an \\"Urgent Action\\" over concerns for his declining health, stating, \\"He is said to suffer from heavy bleeding caused by acute haemorrhoids, reportedly exacerbated by poor prison diet. Overcrowding is a problem in Cameroonian prisons and the food is known to be of poor quality and inadequate.\\" Amnesty International had previously described general conditions at New Bell as \\"often life- threatening\\". In a March 2011 interview, Teyou described his motives for writing his book, saying, \\"We are entitled to rise against the injustice that is crippling our country. We cannot let evil go unquestioned... This book is the expression of my dissatisfaction with what is going on in Cameroon, especially the macabre system that gives Chantal Biya the leeway to treat people around her with extreme cruelty.\\" On 2 May 2011, Teyou was freed when the London chapter of International PEN agreed to pay his fine from its emergency fund in order that he might immediately seek medical treatment for his worsening condition. He then received treatment. The chair of African literature at the University of Bayreuth also offered to pay the expenses for La Belle de la r√©publique banani√®re to be reprinted in Germany.
