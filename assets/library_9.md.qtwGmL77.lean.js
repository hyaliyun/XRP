Its mission is to invest monies entrusted to it by the public authorities on behalf of the community with the aim of financing the pension system. Its investment policy is to optimize returns on the investments it makes as prudently as possible. Its policy must be consistent with those collective values that are designed to promote balanced economic, social and environmental development. Assets under management As of December 2016 the FRR's assets are 36 billion Euros. * History At its creation the target was to build a reserve fund of 150 billion Euro by 2020. The funds were to come from 4 sources: * Surpluses of certain social security funds (Fonds de solidarit√© vieillesse) * Privatization resources * Mobile phone licences * Stock market transaction tax After initially receiving funds from the FSV and 1.2 billion from the privatization of the Autoroute company (Autoroutes du sud de la France) since 2003 the fund has been funded mainly by 65% of the investment tax of 2%. The fund was set up to guarantee the financial stability of: * The CNAV (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Viellesse or National Pension Insurance Bank), * Organic (Caisse de retraite des commer√ßants et des chefs d‚Äôentreprises commerciales or Pensions Bank of the traders), et * Cancava (Caisse de retraite des artisans or Pensions Bank of craftsmen). First payments were set to start in 2020.  Details on the FRR's role  The FRR is a long-run investor. Its mission as conferred by law is to ‚Äúmanage the sums that are allocated to it, to build up reserves to help ensure the long-term future of eligible retirement plans‚Äù. The Fund is also responsible for the financial management of a portion of the exceptional, one- off, lump-sum contribution owed to the CNAV (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse). The government has set out a timetable for the payout of the Fund's assets. Under the terms of the social security financing law 2011,‚Äúthe sums allocated to the Fund are held in reserve until 1st January 2011. As from this date and up until 2024, the Fund shall each year, and at the latest by 31 October, pay 2.1 billion euros to the national social debt amortization fund (Caisse d‚ÄôAmortissement de la Dette Sociale - CADES) to help finance, between 2011 and 2018‚Äù the deficits of the entities that administer the basic pension. On this basis the FRR determines the general investment policy guidelines consistent with\\"the principles of prudence and risk diversification given the target timetable for utilisation of the Fund's resources, in particular the above-mentioned payout obligations\\".In its implementation, the aim of the FRR's investment policy is also to help finance economic actors in general and businesses in particular. This in turn helps to consolidate their prospects for long-term growth and promote sustainable wealth creation and job growth. At the same time, it is consistent with certain shared values that promote balanced economic, social and environmental development. In 2008, the Supervisory Board adopted a responsible investment strategy which seeks to enable the Fund to honour its commitments as a signatory to the UN's PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment).  Activity  The management of its assets is entrusted to authorized investment services providers permitted to conduct portfolio management services on behalf of third parties as referred to in paragraph 4 of article L.321-1 of the monetary and financial Code. As an administrative public establishment, the FRR is required to select its contractors using the French government procurement process (RFP procedures). The employees are mainly coming from the asset management industry, and are specialised in investment services providers selection. FRR's organisation The FRR is a publicly owned, state-funded agency governed by * an Executive Board and, * a Supervisory Board. Consistent with its stated purpose and in light of the volumes of funds it manages, the FRR has set up structures of management and government intended to ensure: * Independence: This spirit is reflected in the Fund's status. * Transparency: Due to the nature of the Fund's resources, its strategy and financial statements must be disclosed to the public at regular intervals. The process of awarding management mandates for the Fund's assets is conducted in compliance with official government regulations on public bidding and requests for proposals (RFPs). * Close involvement of labor and management stakeholders and legislators in the operation of the FRR, via its Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board of the FRR Supervisory Board members include legislators, labor/management stakeholders, representatives of the ministries under whose general supervision the FRR operates (i.e., the ministries of Social Security and of the Economy, Finance and Industry) and individuals with recognized credentials in fields that are relevant to Fund's stated missions. The Board, which currently counts twenty members, is required to meet a minimum of twice yearly. Since November 24, 2011, Alain Vasselle is the President of the Supervisory Board of the FRR.  The Executive Board  The Executive Board has three members: * Eric Lombard ‚Äì Chief Executive Officer of (Caisse des D√©p√¥ts) ‚Äì President of the Executive Board of FRR, * Yves Chevalier ‚Äì member of the Executive board, * Olivier Rousseau ‚Äì member of the Executive board. The Executive Board is responsible for directing the agency and for ensuring its smooth operation. It executes investment policy guidelines and ensures compliance with them. The Executive Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on its management of the agency, and in particular relates information on the way in which investment policy guidelines take into account social, environmental and ethical considerations.

Gay House is a log house located Route 2, 128th Avenue, in Crystal Valley, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1987 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History Jared H. Gay was born in New York in 1830. He moved west to operate sawmills in Lyons, Michigan and Fulton, Ohio, then in 1857 moved to Muskegon to operate a blacksmith's shop. In 1861, Gay arrived in Crystal Valley as a government-appointed blacksmith, serving the local Ottawa and Chippewa population in accordance with the recent treaty which had been signed in 1855. There he and his wife Catherine built this house. The Gays were the first European settlers in what is now Crystal Township, and were instrumental in the early development of the area around Crystal Valley (Catherine Gay christened the area \\"Crystal Valley\\"). Jared Gay worked as the government blacksmith until about 1865. After this, he ran a blacksmith shop located across the street from the house until the shop burned in 1877. By that time, the Gays had begun operating a small sawmill, and had platted out the village of Crystal Valley. In 1882, they constructed a frame house (destroyed in 1965) and moved out of this log structure. In 1902, the Gays sold the property on which this house sits. Mark and Calla Krieger purchased the house in 1954, and renovated it as a weekend home. They lived there until at least 1989. Description The Jared H. Gay House is two-story structure, measuring 20 feet by 30 feet, and built of squared and notched logs on a fieldstone foundation. It is built in an I-shape, with a gable roof covered with asphalt shingles. The gables are timber-framed and covered with clapboard. A single story wing is attached; the original open porch and rear wing have been removed. Additionally, the original front facade with two entrances and two double hung windows was updated to a single entrance with sidelights and a pair of double hung windows. The interior was originally divided up into four approximately equal-sized rooms on the first floor, with a steep narrow staircase leading to the second floor. This has been remodeled into a single large room with a more modern staircase.

Hunt was nominated for a life peerage and Crossbench member of the House of Lords in the 2019 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours. She was created Baroness Hunt of Bethnal Green, of Bethnal Green in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, on 16 October 2019. She was formerly President of the Oxford University Student Union. Biography Hunt was educated at Christ the King Primary School, Cardiff, New College, Cardiff, a former independent school, and King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls, Birmingham, before going on to study English Language and Literature at St Hilda's College, Oxford. Hunt joined the Equality Challenge Unit in January 2004 where she led work to advise Higher Education Institutions on sexual orientation and gender identity equality. In 2005, she joined Stonewall in the role of Senior Policy Officer where she led work on Stonewall's research into homophobic bullying in schools. She became Head of Policy and Research in 2007 and Director of Public Affairs in 2009. During this time Hunt produced research into lesbian, gay and bisexual health needs and inequalities, religion and belief and its impact on sexual orientation equality, older gay people's experiences in Britain and, in 2012, the first guide looking at openly gay role models. In 2013, Ruth Hunt was named as Deputy Chief Executive of Stonewall, overseeing the strategic development and delivery of Stonewall's policy, research, campaigns and information functions which includes the work of Stonewall's Public Affairs team, Education team, the Stonewall Information Service and Stonewall Scotland and Stonewall Cymru. In July 2014, after a period as Acting Chief Executive, she was named Chief Executive of Stonewall. Hunt has overseen the growth of Stonewall's work in Scotland and Wales, in particular the establishment of the Stonewall Cymru bilingual information service and Stonewall Scotland's lobbying to secure the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill. She gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament Equal Opportunities Committee on marriage equality in September 2013. Hunt leads Stonewall's work on policy development and strategic influencing, in particular developing strategic partnerships with organisations across the public and private sector. She has led work with organisations such as the Ministry of Defence, the UK Border Agency, the Home Office and Accenture. As Deputy Chief Executive, Hunt was involved in Stonewall's campaign regarding the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in England and Wales. She was involved in Stonewall's campaign regarding the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, legalising lesbian to access fertility treatment. In October 2013, in its \\"Pink List\\", the Independent on Sunday named Hunt as the fifth most influential LGBT person in Britain. In 2014 she dropped to eighth place in the renamed \\"Rainbow List\\", and in 2015 she was voted into third place. In 2015 she also received an honorary fellowship from Cardiff University, where her mother Sheila was then Professor of Nursing,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/new-chief-school- nursing-2238389 and an honorary degree from Keele University. She attracted much attention in May 2014 when she announced in The Daily Telegraph that Stonewall would not be joining a wide boycott of the Dorchester Hotel in London, owned by the Sultan of Brunei, where Stonewall was to hold a gala dinner. The Sultan was proposing to introduce the death penalty for sodomy but she argued that there was not \\"a mandate for the boycott\\" and \\"We only implement actions that we can calculate will have an impact.\\" Hunt edited The Book of Queer Prophets, a collection of essays on sexuality and religion to be published in May 2020. The book includes essays by Jeanette Winterson, Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, John L. Bell, and others. She publicly apologised days before the 2015 general election after Stonewall was criticised for publishing an online campaign graphic which suggested that only the Labour Party substantially supported LGBT equality in its manifesto. Liberal Democrat government minister Stephen Williams had told PinkNews: \\"I'm astounded by this grossly misleading graphic.\\" In 2019 some donors were reported by The Sunday Times to have stopped funding Stonewall as a consequence of Ms Hunt's position on trans equality. One donor was reported as saying that Ms Hunt was \\"no longer a worthy champion of our rights\\", another that she had \\"lost what the big principle is\\".  Personal life  Hunt entered a civil partnership with her partner Dr. Kirsty Lloyd in 2010,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/ruth-hunt-interview-people-say- it-s-fine-now-it-s-not-we-still-edit-ourselves-9643765.html although it was reported in 2014 that the couple had separated.

Since the launch of the European Bologna Process, along with the transition to bachelor's and master's programs and the growing independence available to higher education institutions (HEIs) in designing their degree programs, the call for the HEIs to establish and advance sound and transparent quality assurance systems has grown continuously. When the accreditation system was established in Germany, FIBAA was founded in 1994 and hence became one of the first agencies to be accredited by the German Accreditation Council. Since 2002, it has been entitled to award the Seal of the Accreditation Council for degree programs in Germany. The FIBAA is organized as a non-profit organization and is headquartered in Bonn, North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany as well FIBAA is registered in Zurich, Switzerland The FIBAA Foundation Council is the leading board of the foundation. It defines and represents the common interests of the founders and decides on the economic and strategic baselines of FIBAA's work. The FIBAA Foundation Council assures that FIBAA's mission is well established in society and its institutions and promotes FIBAA's overall values of transparency, quality and internationality in the field of higher education.  International activities  FIBAA is recognised as a quality assurance agency in: *Germany ‚Äì Accreditation by the German Accreditation Council *Switzerland ‚Äì Recognition by the Federal Department of Economics Affairs FDEA *Netherlands ‚Äì Recognition by the Nederlands Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie (NVAO) *Kazakhstan - Recognition by the Ministry of Education and Science of Kazakhstan *Austria‚Äì Recognition by the Federal Ministry for Science and Research Europe-wide ‚Äì Full membership in European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) Europe-wide-Listed in the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) History Even before the Bologna Declaration announced by the European ministers responsible for higher education in 1999 and the resulting introduction of today's quality assurance systems, it became necessary to develop a suitable form of quality testing due to the confusing range of MBA programs that had developed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Hence, the leading organisations of Swiss, Austrian and German industry established the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA) in autumn 1994 as an international non-profit foundation. Right from day one, the intention was to develop a strict assessment guide for quality assurance in the field of management training. Since its founding, FIBAA has established itself as a quality assurance agency which assesses degree programs, HEIs and their quality management. It examines and promotes German and foreign state and state-recognised private HEIs and universities. Accreditation objectives The accreditation of degree programs is an internationally established quality assurance process in the higher education sector.

The fund offers flexible support for cutting edge, multidisciplinary, multi-investigator and higher risk research. It is intended to streamline US biomedical research and make it more flexible in response to society's health needs. The high-impact programs it supports are known collectively as the \\"NIH Roadmap for Medical Research\\". It is coordinated by the Office of Strategic Coordination, one of the six offices of the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) within the Office of the Director. Common Fund programs are expected to transform the way a broad spectrum of health research is conducted. Initiatives that comprise Common Fund programs are intended to be catalytic in nature by providing limited term investments in strategic areas to stimulate further research through IC-funded mechanisms.

Bush after a delay of 14 years partly due to conflict over stem cell research. The act, among other things, established the Common Fund (to be used at the discretion of the Director on projects of his or her choosing), the Council of Councils (27 members representing the advisory councils of each of the ICs to advise on which research proposals should be funded by the Common Fund), and the Office of Portfolio Analysis and Strategic Initiatives (that, among other things, develops and manages projects supported by the Common Fund). Until then, if the Director had wanted to support a preferred program he or she had had to persuade an individual institute director or group of directors to provide the funds. In 2008, the NIH released a \\"Request for Information (RFI): To Solicit Ideas for Common Fund/Roadmap Trans-NIH Strategic Initiatives,\\" soliciting ideas from the scientific, medical and patient advocate communities about the kinds of initiatives to be supported by the fund. = Notable funded programs = * Protein Capture Reagents program (2010‚Äì2015); \\"focused on binders to transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins\\".

Gandhi and makes available to the world the large corpus of ‚ÄúFundamental Works‚Äù which are useful for any comprehensive study of the life and thought of Gandhiji. Gandhiji was 24 years old in South Africa \\"Natal Indian Congress \\" made in 1894. The Government of India and its Ministry of Culture, acting on the recommendation of the Gandhi Heritage Sites Committee headed by Shri Gopal Krishna Gandhi, gave the responsibility of conceptualising, designing, developing and maintaining the Gandhi Heritage Portal to the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust. The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (100 volumes), Gandhiji No Akshar Deha (82 volumes) and Sampoorna Gandhi Vangmaya (97 volumes) form the basic structure around which the Portal has been developed. The key texts provide first editions of the Key Texts of Gandhi. These are: Hind Swaraj, Satyagraha in South Africa, An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth, From Yervada Mandir, Ashram Observances in Action, Constructive Programmes: Their Meaning and Place, Key To Health, and Gandhi's translation of the Gita as Anasakti Yoga. The Fundamental Works are those through which The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG) was created, for instance the Mahadevbhai Ni Diary. Over time the Portal plans to provide all the collected works. The Journals provide electronic versions of Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young India, Harijan, Harijan Bandhu, and Harijan Sevak. A sub-section provides some of the journals which make for a fuller archive of the Gandhian imagination and scholarship. At present the Portal has placed as representation Gandhi Marg (Hindi & English), Bhoomi Putra, Pyara Bapu and the unique handwritten journal of the Satyagraha Ashram Madhpudo, which among other things carried Prabhudas Gandhi's Jivan Nu Parodh and Kakasaheb Kalelkar's Smaran Yatra. The Portal hopes to include many more journals as it acquires these overtime. Other Works is a section that takes into account the commentarial and memoire literature. The Life and Times section is under development, and will provide information that could lead the reader to explore the data. The Gallery will provide audio, visual, and film material as well as images of caricatures, paintings and postage stamps. The Portal provides a sample of each of these. The Gandhi Heritage Sites, under development and verification, will provide multiple layers of information regarding places that Gandhiji visited. The information will contain references to primary sources about these visits as well. The Collected Works Of Mahatma Gandhi In 1956 Government of India initiated a project unmatched in its aspiration. This was to provide an authentic documentation of all available writings of Gandhiji. The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi is a result of this meticulous and conscientious effort, which concluded in 1994. It was decided that Gandhiji writings should be made available in three languages: Gujarati, English and Hindi. Consequently, Gandhiji No Akshardeha (Gujarati) and Sampoorna Gandhi Vangmaya (Hindi) were created based upon the editorial architecture determined for the CWMG. At present there are 100 volumes of the CWMG, 82 volumes of Gandhiji No Akshardeha and 97 volumes of Sampoorna Gandhi Vangmaya. These volumes provide information about the source of these writings as also the language in which they were originally written. Volumes 1 to 90 of the CWMG follow chronological order, while volumes 91-97 are supplementary volumes created to accommodate new material that came to be acquired subsequent to the publication of the series. Volumes 98 and 99 are Index of Subjects and Index of Persons respectively. Volume 100 is the compilation of Prefaces to the preceding volumes. The Gandhi Heritage Portal provides unabridged, complete sets of these. These are available in two options: archival version and enhanced version, which is a black and white version. These volumes are interlinked through a database that the Portal team has developed. It allows one to move between the three languages and search the same item. This would enable the user to compare and study their texts and explore questions of translation. The search criteria for these are as defined in volumes 98 and 99 of CWMG. The Portal is committed to provide a searchable ebook of the CWMG, based on the first edition. The Key Texts Gandhiji wrote seven books and did a Gujarati translation of the Bhagvad Gita. These eight texts form the section Key Texts. These are Hind Swaraj, Satyagraha in South Africa, An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth, From Yervada Mandir, Ashram Observances in Action, Constructive Programmes: Their Meaning and Place, Key To Health, and Gandhi's translation of the Gita as Anasakti Yoga. These are arranged in a chronological order. The section also provides a history of their printing and translations. Hind Swaraj, which Gandhiji considered as a ‚Äúseed text‚Äù, illustrates this. The Portal provides a facsimile edition of his manuscript, which was written on board the steamer Kildonan Castle between 13 and 22 November 1909. This is followed by the first Gujarati edition printed in the two issues of Indian Opinion (11 December 1909 and 18 December 1909). Gandhiji translated this into English as Indian Home Rule in 1910, subsequent to the proscription imposed upon the Gujarati edition by the Government of Bombay in March 1910. The English translation is followed by a Hindi translation. Similar order is followed in case of all other texts, albeit facsimile editions of other key texts are not available. An attempt has been made to provide first editions of all the works, including translations. Gandhi was acutely sensitive to the question of translation. The translations of his Key Texts were done by his closest associates including Mahadev Desai and Valji Govindji Desai. Gandhi read, revised and authenticated these translations. The Portal also provides rare copies of some of these key texts. The Navajivan of 29 November 1925 carried the first instalment of Gandhiji's autobiography; Satya Na Prayogo, and the last chapter 'Farewell\\" were published in the issue of 3 February 1929 of the same magazine. Mahadev Desai's English translation of it commenced with the 3 December 1925 issue of Young India and continued till that of 3 February 1929. The first edition of the English translation The Story of My Experiments with Truth was published in two volumes: the first containing three parts was issued in 1927, and the second, containing parts IV and V, in 1929. The second revised edition of the autobiography was issued in 1940 with a new title: An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth. The edition of the autobiography placed on the Portal is not only the first English edition, it is that copy on which careful revisions from the point of view of language were suggested by Rt. Hon. Sir V. S. Srinivasa Sastri. The Portal also provides translations of these texts in other languages. At present we have An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth available in thirteen languages. The aspiration is to make available as many translations of the key texts as possible, either in full or with complete bibliographic information. Fundamental Works Fundamental Works are those works, which form the source of the CWMG. These include diaries, memoires, selections from compilations of letters and biographies. It is not possible to imagine the CWMG without the extraordinary diaries of Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji's closest companion from 1917 to 1942. The Fundamental Works provide three language editions of Mahadev Bhai Ni Diary. Similarly, the published works of Manubehn Gandhi also form part of the Fundamental Works. There is a rich and long biographical tradition of recounting Gandhiji's life, which commenced with Rev. Joseph Doke's M K Gandhi: An Indian Patriot in South Africa and include such magnificent works as Pyarelal's The Early Phase and The Last Phase, D G Tendulkar's eight-volume biography Mahatma and Narayan Desai's Maru Jivan Ej Mari Vani. These form part of the Fundamental Works. Also included are works of Gandhi's associates like C F Andrews and Mirabehn. This section also includes various translations of the Key Texts. The aspiration is to provide authoritative selections of Gandhiji's writings in various languages in this section. The Fundamental Works would also include all available volumes of translations of the CWMG in other Indian languages, for example Marathi. Journals Gandhi's endeavour was to reach out and communicate with as many people and opinions as possible. Publication of periodic journals published in multiple languages was one such mode of communication. The Portal provides complete sets of the journals that he owned, edited or published. These include: Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young India, Harijan, Harijan Bandhu and Harijan Sevak. Gandhi's ideas and practices have inspired many movements and academic inquires. ‚ÄúJournals by Others‚Äù presents a selection of journals published by institutions and movements, which seek to interrogate Gandhi's ideas and practices or record, documents and chronicle movements. These include Gandhi Marg (Hindi & English), Bhoomi Putra, Pyara Bapu, Kasturba Darshan and that unique handwritten journal of the Sataygraha Ashram Madhpudo. Full, unabridged texts of these journals are made available. This section would become an archive of the Gandhian imagination and scholarship. The Portal plans to provide an ever expanding list of such journals. Other works Other works is a broad category, which seeks to provide either full, unabridged texts or complete bibliographic information on the vast and ever expanding scholarship on Gandhiji and allied movements and institutions. This section also includes works of those who are crucial interlocutors of Gandhiji; C F Andrews is one example. It is difficult to understand and fully appreciate the striving of Gandhiji in absence of the works of his interlocutors. This section would eventually include either full texts or bibliographic information on writings on Gandhi and his endeavours in academic journals. This will facilitate a more comprehensive access to the contemporary scholarship around these issues. Life And Times This section provides selections, slivers of information arranged for easy reference. All the selections are made from the ‚ÄúChronologies‚Äù that are given as a separate section and other Fundamental Works. Information about tours, marches, Satyagrahas, imprisonments, fasts and assaults are arranged in tabular form. For instance the Dandi March is presented through four subsections: ‚ÄúBackground to the Salt Satyagraha‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Marchers‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe March‚Äù and ‚ÄúEvents post March‚Äù. A virtual tour mapping the walk to Dandi is also provided. The information is also linked to the sources in the CWMG to enable further study. Gandhi Heritage Sites Gandhi moved across the Indian subcontinent and other parts of the world to carry his message of freedom, truth, nonviolence, Satyagraha, Swadeshi and equality for all. This was his way of inhabiting the land and being one with her people. The Gandhi Heritage Sites Committee has designated thirty-nine locations as core sites. At present a detailed site specific chronology is being prepared at the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust. The classification framework includes place, persons, principles and events which will be linked to the source and presented on the Portal. The GHP at present The Portal at present provides approximately 500,000 pages of material in electronic format. In case of CWMG and the Key Texts both archival and enhanced black and white images are provided. In addition to the textual material it has over 1000 photographs, 21 films and 78 audio recordings. While most of the data is interlinked and searchable, at present the search criteria are those which have been determined by Volumes 98 and 99 of CWMG, that is the Index of Subjects and Index of Persons. Goals The Portal plans to make available a searchable electronic edition of The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi based on the first editions. The Trust is also working on a comprehensive compendium on the Gandhi Heritage Sites, which would be made available on the Portal. The Portal plans to place about a million pages of information in multiple languages. These will include Journals, Fundamental Works, and Other Works. The Trust is also in the process of developing an on-line variorum of Gandhiji's manuscripts, and will make available about 150,000 pages of original manuscripts. The variorum will be searchable through the catalogues of the Sabarmati Ashram archives. The Portal will collaborate with other national institutions such as the National Archives of India and the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library to make the variorum as comprehensive as possible.

The two bombings resulted in 23 deaths and injured at least 160 others. Background The bombings were seen as part of the spillover of the Syrian Civil War, in which Hezbollah and Iran have supported the Syrian government, while the Abdullah Azzam Brigades have fought against the Syrian government. On the same day as the bombing, Syrian government forces seized the town of Qarah from rebel fighters in an opening action in the Battle of Qalamoun. The Syrian government effort at the time to eliminate the rebel stronghold in Qalamoun, a region along the Lebanese border with strong ties to the Lebanese Sunni town of Arsal, with strong support of Hezbollah fighters, was expected by some analysts to raise tensions within Lebanon.Hezbollah deploys 15,000 troops for anticipated Qalamoun battle Al Arabiya. 1 November 2013.

The first was reported to be carried out by a bomber either on a motorcycle or on foot. After people had rushed to the scene, a 4x4 vehicle two buildings away from the embassy blew up in a second, deadlier explosion.

Iranian cultural attach√© Ebrahim Ansari was among the dead, with five Iranian security personnel wounded. Ansari and the Iranian ambassador Ghazanfar Roknabadi were scheduled to leave the embassy to attend a meeting at the Ministry of Culture at around the time when the bombs went off. The embassy's head of security, a Lebanese national, was also killed in the blast. Claims of responsibility The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a Sunni Islamist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group declared that its attacks against Iran would continue until Iran \\"withdraws its forces from Syria\\". The group has made false claims in the past. On December 31, sources confirmed that Lebanese authorities have captured Majid bin Mohammad al-Majid, the Saudi leader of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades. The authorities have also convicted Rami Walid Moety, a Lebanese fugitive originally from Joun, of being a collaborator in the crime. He remains at large Leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah said in December television interview that the attack was \\"linked to the Saudi intelligence services\\" because of \\"Saudi Arabia's rage against Iran over (Saudi Arabia's) failure\\" in Syria. Reactions ;Domestic Hezbollah held a public funeral and rally in Beirut the day after the attack. Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem vowed to continue support for the Syrian government in saying the attacks in Lebanon were \\"inevitable pains on the road to victory\\", while mourners chanted \\"Death to America, Israel, and the takfiris!\\" ;Regional Iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham blamed Israel for the attack, calling it \\"an inhuman crime and spiteful act done by Zionists and their mercenaries\\".

It was an a cappella version of the song with four vocal parts (initially 18). The song would later be revisited on Grazhdanskaya Oborona's comeback album Lunnyi perevorot in 1997, as Letov intended. The album was initially distributed to Grazhdanskaya Oborona fans and Letov's friends on reel-to-reel and traded cassettes. It was given its first proper release in 1992 on Zolotaja Dolina, who released it on vinyl and licensed it to BSA Records for release on CD. It was re-released in 1999 on CD and cassette as part of Grazhdanskaya Oborona's record deal with Moroz Records, and again in 2005 on Misteriya Zvuka. It was reissued again in 2014 on Wyrgorod. Mirumir reissued the album on vinyl in 2014, the first vinyl release of the album in 22 years. In 2005, Pryg-skok was remastered and reissued in 2007 with outtakes from the Sto let odinochestva sessions as bonus tracks. The original vinyl and CD issues on Zolotaja Dolina and BSA included a cover of \\"Krasnyi smekh\\" by Instruktsiya po Vyzhivaniyu, but it was left off the 2007 remaster and was finally included on the 2013 vinyl reissue of Grazhdanskaya Oborona's 1990 album Instruktsiya po vyzhivaniyu.

Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time. History The origin of the term can be traced to Albert Goldman and a 1964 article he had written in The New Republic titled \\"Lindy's Law\\". The term Lindy refers to Lindy's delicatessen in New York, where comedians \\"foregather every night at Lindy's, where ... they conduct post-mortems on recent show business 'action'\\". In this article, Goldman describes a folkloric belief among New York City media observers that the amount of material comedians have is constant, and therefore, the frequency of output predicts how long their series will last: Benoit Mandelbrot defined a different concept with the same name in his 1982 book The Fractal Geometry of Nature. In Mandelbrot's version, comedians do not have a fixed amount of comedic material to spread over TV appearances, but rather, the more appearances they make, the more future appearances they are predicted to make: Mandelbrot expressed mathematically that for certain things bounded by the life of the producer, like human promise, future life expectancy is proportional to the past. He references Lindy's Law and a parable of the young poets' cemetery and then applies to researchers and their publications: \\"However long a person's past collected works, it will on the average continue for an equal additional amount. When it eventually stops, it breaks off at precisely half of its promise.\\" Nassim Taleb presented a version of Mandelbrot's idea in The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable by extending it to a certain class of non-perishables where life expectancy can be expressed as power laws. In Taleb's 2012 book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder he for the first time explicitly referred to his idea as the Lindy Effect, removed the bounds of the life of the producer to include anything which doesn't have a natural upper bound, and incorporated it into his broader theory of the Antifragile. According to Taleb, Mandelbrot agreed with the expanded definition of the Lindy Effect: \\"I [Taleb] suggested the boundary perishable/nonperishable and he [Mandelbrot] agreed that the nonperishable would be power-law distributed while the perishable (the initial Lindy story) worked as a mere metaphor.\\" Pareto distribution Lifetimes following the Pareto distribution (a power-law distribution) demonstrate the Lindy effect. For example with the parameter \\\\alpha=2, conditional on reaching an age of x > x_{\\\\min{}}, the expected future lifetime is also x. In particular, initially the expected lifetime is 2 x_{\\\\min{}} but if that point is reached then the expected future lifetime is also 2 x_{\\\\min{}}; if that point is reached making the total lifetime so far 4 x_{\\\\min{}} then the expected future lifetime is 4 x_{\\\\min{}}; and so on. More generally with proportionality rather than equality, given m > 0 and using the parameter \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{m}{m-1} in the Pareto distribution, conditional on reaching any age of x > x_{\\\\min{}}, the expected future lifetime is (m-1)x. Example: for \\\\alpha=2 or m=2 the expected future lifetime is x. Lindy effect is connected to Pareto‚Äôs Law, to Zipf‚Äôs Law, and to socioeconomic inequality.Iddo Eliazar \\"Lindy‚Äôs Law\\", Physica A, 486 (2017) 797‚Äì805 See also * Ergodic theory * Planning fallacy * Survivorship curve * Survivorship bias References Economics effects Ageing ","title":"Lindy effect"},{"id":"41126905","text":"William Baker (14 September 1836) was a New South Wales Marine and member of the First Fleet that founded the European penal colony of New South Wales. Initially an orderly for the colony's first Governor, Arthur Phillip, Baker was later appointed government storekeeper in Parramatta, and storekeeper and superintendent of convicts in the rural settlement of Hawkesbury. In 1810 he was dismissed from all government posts after being found to have misused his position for personal gain, and relocated to Hobart where he became the inaugural crier for Australia's oldest colony-wide judicature, the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land. The Australian fish Latropiscis purpurissatus, or \\"Sergeant Baker\\", is named in his honour. Early life The uniform of the Marines. Engraving by Joseph Stadler, 1815. There are no surviving records of Baker's life prior to enlistment in the New South Wales Marine Corps at the age of 26. Enlistment requirements mandated that members of the New South Wales Corps were at least five and a half feet tall,Moore 1987, p. 16 with previous satisfactory service in the British MarinesMoore 1987, p. 25 and the appearance of being among \\" the stoutest, fittest and healthiest [of] men\\".Marine Order, 28 December 1784, Royal Marine Records. Cited in Moore 1987, pp. 15‚Äì16 =Voyage on First Fleet= Baker joined the First Fleet to New South Wales in 1787 as a Marine corporal of the 53rd (Portsmouth) Company, embarked aboard the convict transport .Gillen 1989, pp. 16‚Äì17 The Fleet set sail from Portsmouth on 13 May 1787. Two days later Baker was severely wounded when he accidentally shot himself in the foot, having placed his loaded musket on the deck while preparing for guard duty.Hill 2009, p. 92 Ship's surgeon John White treated the wound, and reported a significant injury to the right ankle: :: > \\"The bones, after being a good deal shattered, turned the (musket) ball > which, taking another direction, had still force enough left to go through a > harness cask full of beef at some distance, and after that to kill two geese > who were on the other side of it.\\"Report by naval surgeon John White, May > 1787. Cited in Gillen 1989, p.17 Baker was incapacitated for three months, but took pains to advance his recovery through exercise and careful tending of the wound. To the surprise of his shipmates he had recovered sufficiently to resume active duty when the Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro in August 1787. Surgeon White recorded that Baker had regained \\"the perfect use of the wounded leg\\", which he credited to Baker's youth and \\"good habit of body\\". =Marine Service in New South Wales= Captain Watkin Tench, Baker's commanding officer from 1788 to 1791. Artist unknown, . The Fleet arrived in New South Wales in January 1788, with the Marines disembarking first at Botany Bay. Six days later they reboarded the ships for the voyage to Port Jackson, where they were reorganised into four companies under the commands of Captains James Campbell and John Shea, and Captain-Lieutenants Watkin Tench and James Meredith. Baker was promoted to sergeant and assigned to Tench's company alongside fellow sergeants William Perry and Edward Campion.Moore 1987, p. 307 He was further appointed as orderly to the colony's Governor, Arthur Phillip, an administrative office that relieved him of routine duties such as supervising the landing of convicts or clearing trees and undergrowth for the building of the settlement.Moore 1987, pp. 88‚Äì96 Immediately on arrival in Port Jackson Baker also took a common-law wife from among the convicts ‚Äì 25-year-old Susannah Huffnell, who had been sentenced to seven years transportation for petty larceny.Chapman 1986, p.108 Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789.Cobley 1963, p.3 The relationship was not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany his wife and child when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s. Baker's Marine service was uneventful, and his name rarely appears in colonial records for this period. He was an enthusiastic fisherman and may have been the first to catch Latropiscis purpurissatus, a common species along the New South Wales coast and described as \\"growing to more than two feet, coloured red to violet blue with red and yellow tail fin\\", and \\"edible, but not greatly esteemed\\".Chapman 1986, p. 33 The fish was named in his honour in 1843. Marine Corps' terms of enlistment were for three years, with Baker's service expiring in 1791. The bulk of the Marine force departed in December of that year aboard , leaving sixty men behind under the command of Lieutenant John Poulden to support the newly established New South Wales Corps. Baker also remained in the colony, continuing his duties as orderly to Governor Phillip.Moore 1987, pp. 274‚Äì275 He returned to England in December 1792, in company with Phillip and the remaining Marines as passengers aboard the convict transport Atlantic.Britton (ed.) 1978, p. 666 Civilian life On arrival in England, Baker declined re-enlistment into the British Marines and returned to civilian life. Within six months he received an appointment from the Navy Board to act as civilian superintendent of convicts aboard the transport vessel Surprize, which departed for New South Wales in early 1794.Correspondence, Officers of Surprize to Under Secretary King, Spithead 21 April 1794, cited in Bladen (ed) 1978, pp. 854‚Äì855 A British loyalist, Baker took an immediate dislike to four of the convicts under his watch, sentenced for political offences and collectively known as Scottish Martyrs. Late in the voyage he advised Surprizes captain Patrick Campbell that the Martyrs planned to mutiny and seize the vessel. Acting on Baker's word, Campbell had three of the four confined until Surprize reached Sydney Cove.Fletcher (ed). Cited in Collins 1975, p.593 =Farmer and storekeeper= Sketch of Baker's farm, overlooking the Parramatta River. Dated 25 May 1798. Artist unknown. On reaching Sydney Baker resigned his Navy position and sought opportunities as a farmer. His interests were assisted by the deregulation of land grants under Governor Phillip's successor, Francis Grose. In October 1794 he obtained a grant of of farming land near Toongabbie, which he partly cleared and planted with wheat and maize. To supplement his farming income he petitioned for administrative employment and was appointed storekeeper in Parramatta in January 1795, supervising distribution and security of military and civilian supplies.Chapman 1986, pp. 32‚Äì33 On 26 August 1795, having comfortably established himself as a farmer and government agent, Baker married former convict Elizabeth Lavender. Two months later Governor John Hunter appointed him superintendent of convicts for the Hawkesbury region, a newly established area of farms to the northwest of Baker's own lands.Cobley 1986, p. xxi His reputation was somewhat marred by a 1797 conviction for stealing a boat worth ¬£16 from a neighbour, Thomas Raby. Baker admitted possession of the vessel but denied it was Raby's. He was found guilty of theft and fined a proportion of the vessel's value.New South Wales Court of Civil Jurisdiction, Minutes 185‚Äì187, July 1797. Cited in Cobley 1986, p. 155 In 1798 Baker received a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region in addition to his equivalent duties in Parramatta.Steele 1977, p.2 Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.Cobley 1986, pp. 212‚Äì213 Regardless of this setback, the following years were personally prosperous for Baker. In early 1800 he received a further official grant of at Mulgrave, and on 20 June he purchased another 30 acres from a dissolute former convict, Charles Williams, who had settled in 1791 but abandoned active farming. Baker's dealings in this period were not particularly honest; in 1800 he refused to pay a government debt of ¬£86 owed for use of two servants that had worked on his farm since 1798, and historian Brian Fletcher has suggested he also misappropriated supplies and labour from his own government store.Report of Extra Servants assigned to Officers and others, 1 October 1800. In Bladen (ed.) 1979, pp. 218‚Äì219Fletcher (ed). Cited in Collins 1975, p. 525 No action was taken against Baker for these offences, and with ready access to resources he was able to swiftly clear and farm his properties. Land grant records in 1801 indicate that Baker had twelve acres of maize and wheat under cultivation with another twelve acres lying fallow, and that he owned one horse, four goats and 22 hogs. His two unpaid servants were recorded as still being present on the farm.\\"List of every Civil and Military Officer (including Storekeepers and Superintendants) in His Majesty's territory of New South Wales holding land by grant or lease.\\" 31 December 1801. In Bladen (ed.) 1979, pp. 648‚Äì649 In 1800 Baker also bought and began operating a public house, The Royal Oak, selling alcohol to convicts and settlers in Windsor.Steele 1977, pp. 58‚Äì59 =Dismissal= As a publican Baker supported Governor William Blighs attempts to regulate liquor imports, and signed a letter to this effect in 1807. Despite this, he publicly welcomed Bligh's overthrow in the 1808 Rum Rebellion and congratulated former Marines officer George Johnston for helping seize executive authority on behalf of the New South Wales Corps. In so doing he drew the attention of Bligh's replacement, Governor Lachlan Macquarie, who commenced an investigation into accusations that Baker had unfairly treated Hawkesbury settlers by appropriating supplies from the government store. The accusations were upheld and in 1810 Baker was dismissed from all his government posts. The Royal Oak, described by a later historian as one of \\"the worst houses along the river\\", was also ordered to be closed.Steele 1977, p.148 =Life in Hobart= His business interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales to the southern settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside outside the courthouse.Gillen 1989, p. 17 Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery. The Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land was established by The Royal Letters Patent of 13 October 1823 and commenced activities on 10 May 1824, with Baker as its inaugural crier.Supreme Court History ‚Äì Charter of Justice, Supreme Court of Tasmania This would be Baker's last and longest occupation. In February 1836 he received his first pay rise since becoming crier, being granted an extra ¬£20. A contemporary reference applauded Baker's respectable appearance as crier but noted that he was \\"in the habit of sometimes getting tipsy\\" while performing his tasks. Death Baker died in Hobart on 14 September 1836, at the age of 75. At the time of his death he owned 230 acres of uncultivated land at Argyle and Ulva, Van Diemen's Land. He is commemorated in the naming of Baker Street in Windsor, New South Wales, adjacent to the former site of The Royal Oak hotel, and in Baker's Lagoon, a body of water located between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Richmond.Clouston Associates 2013, p.47 Notes =Footnotes= =Citations=    References 1761 births 1836 deaths Settlers of Australia 18th-century Royal Marines personnel Place of birth unknown Place of birth missing ","title":"William Baker (colonist)"},{"id":"41126907","text":"This is the first edition of the event.

Parus Capital focuses on Russian securities undervalued by international portfolio investors, according to Muravyov. Muravyov claims that, after starting with US$30 million in 2008, the fund had US$50 million in assets by 2012 without raising additional capital from investors; the fund's asset value appreciated 19% year-on-year in 2012 alone, according to Muravyov. The fund's core shareholders claim they have an additional US$150 million ‚Äì both of available equity and as debt they can access. Parus Agro Group was established in 2009 with the Fund's resources; the new company focuses on crop farming and owns approximately 95,000 hectares of arable land in the Krasnodar Region of Russia and in Ukraine. The group includes marketing and logistics companies, as well as grain silos with 290,000 tons storage capacity. The fund has also invested some of its assets in QIWI and in real estate construction projects. Muravyov built Ecopromservice, Russia's only plant to recycle and restore oversized tires in 2010 and established the United Water Company in Pyatigorsk to \\"produce and bottle mineral water. Awards He is the recipient of medals For a Special Contribution to Development of Kuzbass, 3rd Class, and For Faith and Kindness, and a National Heritage badge of honor.

It covered among other topics clinical research design, data analysis, bioethics, and critical review of the medical literature; but most of each fellow's time was devoted to conducting supervised clinical or translational research in their area of interest. NIH clinician-scientists guided fellows in developing their own learning plans which involved collaborating with principal investigators in NIH intramural laboratories and in clinical areas at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland; and this research work was complemented by seminars and journal clubs with peers, and engagement with patients enrolled in investigational protocols. The program trained 310 medical and dental students in 15 different NIH institutes/centers on the intramural campus of the NIH in Bethesda; and the last class was completed in 2012. NIH Director at the time, Harold Varmus, inaugurated the program to offer creative, research- oriented students the chance to engage in clinical research early in their careers. From 1998 it was supported jointly by the NIH and the Foundation for the NIH, using money provided by Pfizer Inc. By 2004 it was accepting 30 students annually, supported by the NIH Common Fund (formerly the NIH Roadmap) as part of its Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise theme. In summer 2012, a new program, the NIH Medical Research Scholars Program, commenced, expanding on the aims and focus of the CRTP and the HHMI-NIH Research Scholars Program and accepting medical, dental, and veterinary students.NIH Clinical Research Training Program Background A number of one-year research training programs have arisen in the US, including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Medical Fellows Program (1984‚Äìpresent), the HHMI-NIH Research Scholars Program (1989‚Äìpresent), the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship Program, and the Sarnoff Cardiovascular Foundation Research Fellowship Program. A 2003 analysis of early career outcomes from the HHMI Medical Fellows and HHMI-NIH Research Scholars Programs found that alumni of these programs were more likely to receive NIH post-doctoral awards, and unpublished data from the NIH CRTP indicate that more than 30% of alumni spend over 25% of their time doing translational or clinical research.

The dinners were organized for example in one of the main parks in Helsinki, on a beach, and in the Teurastamo courtyard. The event was organized in co-operation with Helsingin Energia and Helsinki city's Department of Public works. Similar events have been organized around the world, for example, the D√Æner en blanc, which has been arranged since 1988. The Dinner under the Helsinki sky is however more an unofficial and informal event where all the inhabitants can take part in. The next Dinner under the Helsinki sky is planned to take place during Helsinki-day on 12 June 2014 and the next Dinner under the Helsinki sky Everywhere is held in August 2014. Background Both events are created by Yhteismaa ry - Commonland, organization whose other projects are The Cleaning day, Parking day and Nifty Neighbor ‚Äì A Place to Care.

It has a number of advisory committees, such as the Academic Steering & Advocacy Committee which includes PLOS co-founder Michael Eisen, Quebec-based academic Jean-Claude Gu√©don, and the Director of Scholarly Communication of the Modern Language Association, Kathleen Fitzpatrick. There is an Internationalisation committee to develop an international strategy. A member of this committee, Francisco Osorio, has written that the open access model of the Open Library of Humanities may be beneficial for researchers publishing in languages other than English. Although originally intended to run on Open Journal Systems, in 2017 OLH started development of a new platform, Janeway. Currently the main press site and the journal Orbit are hosted on the new platform. The University of Lincoln, in partnership with the Public Knowledge Project, offered a funded place for an MSc by Research in Computer Science to develop an open-source XML typesetting tool as proposed by the Open Library of Humanities technical roadmap. In November 2013 it was announced that the Public Knowledge Project will be funding the development of the typesetter, known as meTypeset. The Open Library of Humanities publishing model relies on support from an international collection of libraries, which in effect allows the publication of articles without the need for article processing charges.

It contains a single species, Acheroraptor temertyorum. A. temertyorum is one of the two geologically youngest known species of dromaeosaurids, the other being Dakotaraptor, which is also known from Hell Creek. A basal cousin of Velociraptor, Acheroraptor is known from upper and lower jaw material.  Discovery and naming  Known material Acheroraptor was first described and named by David C. Evans, Derek W. Larson and Philip J. Currie in 2013 and the type species is Acheroraptor temertyorum. The generic name is derived from the Greek ·ºàœáŒ≠œÅœâŒΩ, Acheron, \\"underworld\\", in reference to the provenance from the Hell Creek Formation, and the Latin raptor, \\"thief\\". The specific name honours James and Louise Temerty, the chairman of Northland Power and the ROM Board of Governors and his wife, who have supported the museum for many years. Acheroraptor is known from the holotype ROM 63777, a complete right maxilla with several maxillary teeth (some isolated), and from a referred dentary (lower jaw) ROM 63778, both housed at the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada. Both specimens were collected approximately four metres from one another, from the same mixed faunal bonebed that occurs in the upper part of the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, dating to the latest Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, immediately prior to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The holotype specimen was collected on August 28, 2009 by commercial fossil hunters, one of whom also collected the dentary several years later, and who were later able to provide detailed geographic data from GPS and photographs of the specimen in situ in the ground on the day of discovery. Both specimens were subsequently purchased by the Royal Ontario Museum from a private collector.  Classification  Restoration The phylogenetic position of Acheroraptor was explored by Evans et al. (2013) using several data matrices. Both specimens of Acheroraptor were coded as a single taxon into Turner et al. (2012) data matrix, an extensive phylogenetic analysis of theropods that focuses on maniraptorans. Acheroraptor was recovered as a member of the clade containing Eudromaeosauria and Microraptorinae, confirming its referral to the Dromaeosauridae, and possibly to Eudromaeosauria. Within that clade, however, most taxa were recovered in a large polytomy, due to the limited codings available for Acheroraptor. Evans et al. (2013) also coded the specimens of Acheroraptor (together and separately) into an updated version of the smaller, dromaeosaur-specific dataset from Longrich and Currie (2009). Velociraptor osmolskae and Balaur bondoc were added, Itemirus was excluded (following its identification as a tyrannosauroid by Miyashita and Currie (2009)), and following Turner et al. (2012) the codings for Adasaurus mongoliensis were separated into these based on the holotype from the Nemegt Formation, and these based on IGN 100/23 from the Bayanshiree Formation. Several characters were also rescored and modified, and two maxillary characters were added to the matrix from Turner et al. (2012). This analysis yielded a more resolved topology, placing Acheroraptor in a relatively basal position within the Velociraptorinae, which was otherwise found to include only Asian dromaeosaurids. The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of Acheroraptor following this analysis.  Paleoecology  Acheroraptor and other fauna from Hell Creek (Acheroraptor in reddish orange) Acheroraptor is the youngest species of dromaeosaurid, and is from the Hell Creek Formation. The Hell Creek Formation is from the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event, and has been dated to 66 ¬± 0.07 million years ago. Many animals and plants have been found in the Hell Creek Formation, the discovery site of Acheroraptor. As it is known from the Tyrannosaurus-Triceratops fauna, Acheroraptor is the youngest dromaeosaurid, along with the much larger Dakotaraptor. Evans et al. found that Acheroraptor was the only dromaeosaurid from the Hell Creek Formation. Common teeth previously referred to Dromaeosaurus and Saurornitholestes would then be considered Acheroraptor. Evans et al. also concluded that there was probably only one dromaeosaurid in the Hell Creek-Lance assemblage. In 2015, this view was disproven, with the description of Dakotaraptor, a far larger second dromaeosaur from the formation. Other non-dromaeosaurid theropods from the formation are tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, troodontids, birds, and caenagnathids. The tyrannosaurids from the formation are Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus, although the former might be a junior synonym of the latter. Among ornithomimids are the genera Struthiomimus as well as Ornithomimus, and \\"Orcomimus.\\" The birds known from the formation are Avisaurus, Brodavis baileyi, and two unnamed hesperornithoforms, possibly Potamornis. Only three oviraptorosaurs are from the Hell Creek Formation, Anzu, Leptorhynchos and third and undescribed specimen, very similar to Gigantoraptor, from South Dakota. However, only fossilized foot prints were discovered as of 2016. The known troodontids from this formation include Troodon, Pectinodon, and Paronychodon. A single species of coelurosaur is known from similar fossil formations includes Richardoestesia. left Ornithischians are abundant in the Hell Creek Formation. The main groups of ornithischians are ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and pachycephalosaurians. One ankylosaurian and two nodosaurians are known, Ankylosaurus, Denversaurus and possibly Edmontonia. Multiple genera of ceratopsians are known from the formation, the leptoceratopsid Leptoceratops and the chasmosaurines Nedoceratops, Torosaurus, Triceratops, and Tatankaceratops. Hadrosaurs are common in the Hell Creek Formation, and are known from multiple species of the ornithopod Thescelosaurus, and the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus, and an undescribed genus similar to Parasaurolophus. Five pachycephalosaurians have been found in the Hell Creek Formation. Among them are the derived pachycephalosaurids Sphaerotholus, Stygimoloch, Dracorex, Pachycephalosaurus, and an undescribed specimen from North Dakota. Mammals are plentiful in the Hell Creek Formation. Groups represented include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include Paracimexomys, the cimolomyids Paressonodon, Meniscoessus, Essonodon, Cimolomys, Cimolodon, and Cimexomys; and the neoplagiaulacids Mesodma, and Neoplagiaulax. The alphadontids Alphadon, Protalphodon, and Turgidodon, pediomyids Pediomys, Protolambda, and Leptalestes, the stagodontid Didelphodon, the deltatheridiid Nanocuris, the herpetotheriid Nortedelphys, and the glasbiid Glasbius all represent metatherians of the Hell Creek Formation. A few eutherians are known, being represented by Alostera, Protungulatum, the cimolestids Cimolestes and Batodon, the gypsonictopsid Gypsonictops, and the possible nyctitheriid Paranyctoides.

It provides education from pre-school age through all grades to year 12. The school is one of the oldest in Papua New Guinea and is located next to St Joseph's Parish Church in the suburb of Boroko.  History  St Joseph's School was founded in 1917 as a school for the children of expatriates living in Port Moresby. Originally situated within the Convent of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (OLSH) behind St. Mary's Cathedral, it started with only 15 pupils. Sister Mary Carthage was the first Head of School. The school was closed between 1941 and 1946 because of the war. Enrollments rose steadily after the war and by the late 1950s the school's facilities had become too small to cater for the children's needs. The population around Boroko had grown and there was a need for a catholic school in the area so it was decided that St Joseph's would move to Boroko. The relocation took several years and was done in stages, starting with one class moving from Port Moresby to the Church Hall in Boroko in 1957. The OLSH sisters taught classes in the Hall while the new school was being built. The school became St Joseph's International Catholic College after secondary school classes started in 2004. The first cohort of year 10 students sat for the PNG School Certificate, and NSW School Certificate, in 2007. The first cohort of year 12 students sat for the PNG Higher School Certificate, and NSW Higher School Certificate, in 2009.  Academic and sporting program  The school holds an outstanding reputation in exam results. Since starting secondary school classes, the school has consistently topped the Port Moresby results for the year 8 public examinations and year 10 certificate index ratings. In previous years, when the former year 6 examinations were being conducted, high grades were also obtained. The college participates in regular competitions for track and field athletics, swimming, basketball, and volleyball. An inter-school rugby union competition for the National Capital District was started in 2013, with St Joseph's fielding teams in the grand final matches of all three divisions ‚Äì U14 and U17 male, and U17 female.

Many historians have registered this incident and Govt's CBSE 9th syllabus has shown this incident in a section entitled ‚ÄòCaste, Conflict and Dress Change‚Äô from its social science curriculum for Class IX students and later it was removed on account of an order by the Madras high court ‚Äúobjectionable content\\" as it was perceived as a sign of respect towards the ‚Äòupper‚Äô castes.. Background Multiple historians have documented that uncovering one's breasts was revered as a symbolic token of homage from the lower castes towards the upper castes in the kingdom of Travancore (wherein the relatively fluid caste hierarchies prevalent in South India was reified by the rulers) and a state-law prevented any covering of breasts since it demarcated the caste hierarchy in a prominent manner. This had often been the focal point of multiple rebellions by lower castes. A breast tax (mulakkaram) was also allegedly imposed by the-then Brahmin king on lower caste Hindu women, which was to be paid if they wished to cover their breasts in public; the tax was supposedly assessed in proportion to the size of their breasts. However, historical documentation of the conditionality of this tax and its linkage with breast size is scarce, despite ample primary literature covering the spans ‚Äî Manu S. Pillai and other scholars reject a rigid interpretation of the etymological connection and instead assert it to be a generic woman- specific tax that was charged from all lower caste communities. Legend According to the popular narrative, in the early years of the 19th century, the pravathiyar (village officer) of Travancore came to Nangeli's home to survey her breasts and collect the breast tax. Nangeli revolted against the harassment; chopping off her breasts and presenting them to him in a plantain leaf. She died soon from loss of blood and her husband Chirukandan, seeing her mutilated body was overcome by grief and jumped into her funeral pyre - in what was supposedly the first male sati. The couple was childless. Following the death of Nangeli, a series of people's movements apparently set off and similar folk-lores have been noted. The breast tax system was supposedly annulled in Travancore, soon afterwards and the place she lived had came to be known as Mulachiparambu (meaning land of the breasted woman). = Scholarly reception = The tale is not recognized in any of India's historical accounts. Pillai rejects the narrative in entirety and argues that covering breasts was not a fashion in Kerala's radically liberal and matriarchal society during Nangeli's life-span. Victorian standards of morality penetrated into the society decades later via the British invaders, which led to subsequent class-struggles for the right to wear upper cloth. He believes Nangeli to have protested against an oppressive tax regime that was imposed upon all lower castes, which got appropriated with the passage of time, in pursuit of a different patriarchal fight for the preservation of female dignity.  Popular culture  Comic strips have been designed to infuse the story into the current struggles by Dalits against Brahminism. A film on her has been proposed by Vinayan. In 2019 Tamil film Aadai showed a pictorial depiction of the tale of Nangeli.

In 2020, Rizzo was elected by his colleagues to serve as Minority Floor Leader. Prior to his election into the Senate, Rizzo was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives, serving the 19th and 40th districts from 2011 to 2017. In the House, Rizzo also served as Democratic Minority Whip. Early life, education and career John J. Rizzo was born in Kansas City, Missouri on October 3, 1980 to Henry and Silvia Rizzo. His father was a Missouri State Representative from 1985 until 2002 and in recent years served as chairman of the Jackson County legislature. His mother, like her husband and son, was also a Jackson County legislator. He has one older brother, Tony, who works for the Kansas City Police Department. Rizzo went on to earn his BA in English and BS in Political Science from Rockhurst University in his hometown. At Rockhurst, Rizzo was on the board of directors of Old Northeast, Inc., a non-profit that worked to restore homes in the Old Northeast neighborhood of Kansas City. He also became a Jackson County Committeeman as a Young Democrat, serving Ward 11. Upon his graduation, he was appointed to the board of directors at Truman Medical Centers, serving on the fiscal responsibility committee there until his election to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2011. Tenure Rizzo is an opponent of Missouri's new \\"right-to-work\\" legislation arguing, \\"When you look at dollars and cents, I was told in politics years ago, when it's not about the money, it's about the money. I think we all know obviously what it's about. It's about lower wages. Rizzo has voted against setting a higher bar for discrimination lawsuits, tightening restrictions on lifetime government benefits and unemployment benefits as well as implementing voter identification laws. He has voted for an increase in the sales tax and against any cuts in income or corporate tax rates. His record indicates a pro-choice stance and support for an expansion of insurance coverage. Controversy After all the votes were tallied in the highly competitive House District 40 race in 2010, Rizzo led fellow Democrat John Royster by 6 votes (650-644). After an automatic recount was triggered, Rizzo held on to his lead by a single vote, which led Royster to take his case to the Jackson County circuit court over several alleged voting irregularities. Although Kansas City election officials confirmed more than 24 voting discrepancies, Rizzo prevailed. The Missouri Court of Appeals heard the case but expressed concern that there wasn't enough time for a new primary election. The court ultimately denied Royster's appeal before new evidence was brought forth including three voters who had admitted on camera to KCTV to using a false address in the district in order to vote there. Three years later, Rizzo's aunt and uncle pleaded guilty to charges filed by Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker of illegally voting in 2010, though Rizzo denied any knowledge of the illegal act. The pair was fined and are barred from voting in Missouri for life.

DiDonna went to Alexander Hamilton Technical High School in Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn College for one semester. In 1961 he enrolled in the Pratt Institute, also in Brooklyn, and graduated in 1964. From 1966 to 1968 he pursued his graduate degree in fine arts at Columbia University. Among his early influences were Matisse, Mondrain, and Kandinsky, as well as Raphael and early Italian Renaissance artists such as Fra Angelico.Baker (2013). p. 32. He called his early paintings ‚Äúreligious‚Äù and they often were on religious themes, such as crucifixions and the stations of the cross.Baker (1997) By 1970 he was starting to work with the minimal marks that would come to characterize his painting and in late 1971 he ‚Äúchose to limit himself to only dots, dashes, or straight lines loosely aligned in a horizontal and vertical formation. The restrictions resulted in a flexible grid, a form that would wholly absorb him for nearly a decade.‚ÄùBaker (2013). p.52 The critic, Barry Schwabsky, in an essay for a 1994 exhibition catalog wrote that reviewers of DiDonna's work in the 1970s naturally mentioned Agnes Martin as an influence, as well as Brice Marden and the early dot paintings of Larry Poons.Schwabsky (1994) He made a trip to Italy in 1980 and to Mexico in 1981 where he admired the Mayan and Aztec sites.Baker (2013). p .98 By this time DiDonna had moved away from linear grids of lines and dots and began to experiment with ‚Äúasymmetry and welcomed unexpected light.‚ÄùBaker (2013). p. 81 An hour-glass shape started to become an important structural element in his paintings.

The program selects startups for investment and offers on-site support and mentoring in exchange for equity over a period of 180 days spent at the HAX locations in San Francisco and Shenzhen. HAX was the first and most active accelerator in the world to focus on hardware startups, leveraging its unique access to Shenzhen and San Francisco ecosystems. As of 2019, 50% from USA, 20% from Europe, 20% from China and 10% from the rest of the world. Founding History Founded in 2011 by Cyril Ebersweiler and Sean O'Sullivan, the roots of the HAX Accelerator program took hold when another accelerator program, CHINA-AXLR8R was born in Dalian, China in 2009. The summer program produced two promising startups that were working on \\"disruptive\\" hardware. Cyril Ebersweiler recognized that the opportunity to \\"accelerate\\" hardware startups had arrived, thanks to the gradual opening of Shenzhen's supply chain. The first HAX Accelerator program ran in Shenzhen from March to June 2012. HAX Seed Program  HAX Seed Program is currently an accelerator program exclusively focused on hardware development that includes both a cash investment and product development support in exchange for equity. Startups that are accepted into the program spend 180 days with the HAX team of engineers, designers and entrepreneurs at their locations in Shenzhen and San Francisco. The startups get access to the Shenzhen ecosystem, close to the supply chain and factory ecosystem available there. Startups focus on improving their product positioning and strategy, iterate on prototypes, prepare for manufacturing, and launch with media and , they manufacture and distribute it. Mentors assist the startups in practical areas of business like executive coaching, graphic design, mechanical and packaging design, factory sourcing, distribution. At the end of the program the startup presents the final product to investors and raise further capital both HAX and investor network. Selection Process Startups are selected among hundreds of applicants, by applying online with a prototype targeting a large market with a major competitive advantage. This advantage often comes from a unique ability to combing physical and digital technologies. Notable Startups As of June 2020, over 250 startups have participated in the HAX Programs. Among notable startups are: * Makeblock, a Shenzhen-based STEM robotics company that raised over $36M at a $200M valuation. * Several robotics companies such as Simbe Robotics (inventory robot), Dispatch (delivery robot) and Rovenso (all- terrain rover) * 11 startups who raised over $1M on Kickstarter including CHIP, Kokoon, Prynt and more. * M5Stack, a Shenzhen-based company making stackable product development toolkits based on ESP32, targeting applications such as STEM Learning and IoT.

In partnership with private investors and with state funding, the city is beautifying its riverfront district to add a pedestrian walkway and visitor amenities. The city envisions the area as a venue for many local fairs, festivals and other events. Amenities Planned amenities include: * Riverwalk Trail * Dan River access * Historic Architecture * The Crossing at the Dan * Broadband Public Sector projects Several individual projects have been undertaken towards the goal of an improved river district. =Streetscape= A streetscape project along Main Street began in the Summer of 2012. The project features wider sidewalks, installation of brick pavers and creation of more visible and safer pedestrian crossings. It also will provide amenities such as outdoor caf√© space, trees, benches, and new lighting. Land Planning & Design Associates (LPDA), a Virginia-based landscape architecture and planning consulting firm, designed the streetscape project. The first phase focuses on Main Street from Memorial Drive and Craghead Street to Floyd Street, and on North Union Street from Main Street to Spring Street. In addition to installing a storm drainage system, the project will reduce the number of traffic lanes on Main Street from three to two by eliminating the center turn lane. This change will allow for the wider sidewalks and a more pedestrian-friendly environment. =Main Street Plaza= A former one-way road leading to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Bridge has been closed to traffic permanently as a pedestrian plaza is under construction. JTI Leaf Services is donating $400,000 for a fountain that will be included in the plaza. =Downtowner demolition= The first phase of the streetscape project began with the demolition of the Downtowner Motor Inn. The inn was an outdated eyesore that had been abandoned since 1986. Constructed in 1963 at the corner of Main and Union streets, the Inn stood seven stories high and featured 116 rental rooms, a rooftop penthouse, 15 meeting rooms, elevators, a restaurant, a nightclub, and commercial tenant spaces. Because of its high visibility, the building became a focal point for blight in the River District, as it stood empty for almost 30 years. Today, 501 Main Street is home to a blank canvas green space (See:Live Web Camera), which use is still to be determined. The Danville Industrial Development Authority (IDA) purchased the privately owned lot above the site and created 30 spaces with the use of about 15 feet of the Downtowner lot. LPDA has drafted design concepts for the future use of the Downtowner lot, but no decisions have been officially announced. =Branding= To tie all of this together, the city has hired consultants who are guiding the process of creating a branding platform for the River District. A wayfinding signage project will accompany the branding effort. This portion of the project will be revealed in the Summer of 2014. History This area has been the commercial and administrative heart of the city since the 1790s. The Dan River and the River District are what distinguish Danville from thousands of other communities competing to attract new residents and businesses. With many of Danville‚Äôs oldest, most architecturally attractive and significant buildings, it is the most important gathering place for community events. Craghead Street, Danville, Virginia Danville had an economic peak during and era of textiles and tobacco. Due to restructuring of these industries, many of the downtown and tobacco buildings have been left empty, as the area lost its purpose as the community‚Äôs commercial center.

Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into a storage hulk for mines. After the end of World War I, she was discarded and broken up for scrap in 1921. Design Illustration of her sister ship Condor was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by four coal- fired cylindrical boilers. These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, p. 97 The ship was armed with eight 10.5 cm SK L/35 quick-firing (QF) guns in single pedestal mounts, supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total. They had a range of . Two guns were placed side by side forward, two on each broadside, and two side by side aft. The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon.Gardiner, p. 253 She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes, both of which were mounted on the deck. Service history Condor was ordered as a replacement for the gunboat , which had been sunk by the hurricane that hit Apia in 1889.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 190 She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1891. An outbreak of Cholera in Hamburg made work on the ship difficult, but the completed hull was nevertheless ready for launching as scheduled, on 23 February 1892. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Schr√∂der, the Chief of the Baltic Station, gave the speech at her launching, and she was christened by Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) von Bodenhausen, the director of the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship accidentally launched itself due to the tide coming earlier than expected. She was completed on 9 December of that year, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy;Gardiner, p. 253 precautions against cholera delayed the beginning of sea trials until 15 December. =East Africa Station= On 2 October 1894, Condor was deployed to German East Africa, based in Dar es Salaam to replace the gunboat . One of the major reasons Condor was sent to the East African Station was the pressure Britain was placing on the Boer republics--the Transvaal and the Orange Free State--which Germany held to be in its interest. While in East Africa, Condor would have been able to rapidly respond to British actions in the region. And so while stationed here, Condor frequently moved back and forth between German East Africa and the eastern coast of South Africa until 1899, when the Second Boer War broke out. From 15 December 1894 to 1 January 1895, Condor was anchored in Louren√ßo Marques, the capital of Portuguese Mozambique. On 27 June, she joined her sister in Delagoa Bay. Despite the tensions between Germany and Britain, Condor went to Durban for her annual overhaul, which lasted from 3 August to 16 November. She thereafter returned to German East Africa and replaced her sister there. In late December 1895, the British launched the so-called Jameson Raid into the Transvaal; this prompted the German Navy to send Condor back to Louren√ßo Marques in January 1896. From 14 to 16 June, she was sent to Mah√© in the Seychelles to rest her crew. She was called back early to return to East Africa. From 26 August to 25 November, she lay off Cape Town, but protests against the German consul, Count von Pfeil, led to moving the cruiser back to Louren√ßo Marques, where she remained from 11 December to 2 February 1897. A delegation from the cruiser was sent to the opening ceremonies for the Pretoria-Louren√ßo Marques rail line, which had been built with German funding. During this period, she served with the cruiser .Naval Notes, 1899, p. 86 On 3 January 1901, Condor departed Africa, bound for Germany. While en route in the North Sea, she responded to the distress signal from the German steamer Mawska. =South-Seas Station= While in Germany, she underwent repairs to her hull and propulsion system. Two years later, she was sent to the Pacific to replace Cormoran on the South-Seas Station. On 26 June 1903, she arrived in Singapore. In 1904, Condor served with her sister Seeadler and the old gunboat M√∂we, which had by that time been converted to a survey ship.Naval Notes, 1904, p. 1079 Condor helped suppress minor unrest in German Samoa between July and September 1904. In April-May 1905, she went to Sydney, Australia for basic repairs. She thereafter carried the Imperial governor of German Samoa, Wilhelm Solf, on a visit to Hawaii; the trip lasted from 30 August to 14 September. Annual overhauls in Sydney took place during the periods 9 March - 16 May 1907 and 10 March - 18 May 1908. In October 1907, Condor was sent to the southern Ralik Chain to conduct gunnery training. The gunfire was intended as a show of force to prevent the local tribal chief from rebelling against the German authorities.Hezel, p. 126 In concert with the gunboat , Condor participated in the suppression of unrest in the Marshall Islands in September and October 1908.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 191 During this operation, she carried a contingent of Melanesian infantry to the island of Pohnpei to suppress tensions between rival factions on the island.Hezel, p. 135 In early 1909, unrest broke out in Apia; because Condor was absent, the light cruisers and and Jaguar were sent to suppress the uprising. In August, Condor searched unsuccessfully for the lost government steamer Seestern, which had been sailing to Brisbane. Condor met the armored cruiser and the light cruisers and from the East Asia Squadron in Apia in July 1910. In January 1911, she went to Pohnpei again to suppress the Sokehs Rebellion, along with Leipzig and Cormoran. From 20 May 1911 to 1 October 1911, she underwent basic repairs at the Kaiserliche Werft at Tsingtau. During the Agadir Crisis in November, she went to Yap in order to be able to quickly receive news from the recently constructed wireless station there. Further maintenance was effected at Sydney from 1 March to 18 April 1912. That year, her survey staff was enlarged to allow for greater coastal survey work in the German protectorates. On 8 January 1913, Condor was reclassified as a gunboat. During basic repairs in Tsingtao in May, her hull was found to be in very bad condition. The order to return to Germany came while she was stationed in Apia in November. While en route, she had to protect the German steamer Zanzibar from hostile Moroccans, which had run aground off the Moroccan coast. =Fate= Condor arrived in Danzig on 30 March 1914, where she was placed out of service. Starting in 1916, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines off Friedrichsort in Kiel. She served in this capacity throughout World War I, and she was discarded in the post-war reduction in the strength of the German navy. She was stricken on 18 November 1920 and sold for scrapping on 8 April 1921. She was broken up that year in Hamburg.Gr√∂ner, p. 98  Notes  = Footnotes = = Citations = References  Bussard-class cruisers ","title":"SMS Condor"},{"id":"41127927","title":"Kevin Fiala"},{"id":"41127929","text":"Jos√© Miguel Sag√ºillo is a Spanish philosopher.

Services are held in the Welsh language. Established in 1844, Siloa is one of the few Welsh language chapels in the locality to remain open today. Siloa was notable for its long-serving ministers and in over a century there were only three pastorates, namely those of David Price (1843‚Äì78), D. Silyn Evans (1880‚Äì1930) and R. Ifor Parry (1933‚Äì64). Siloa Chapel, Aberdare Foundation In 1841, Thomas Rees, then minister at Ebenezer, Trecynon began to hold a Sunday school in what was then the adjacent village of Aberdare, and also began to preach in English, with a view of establishing an English-language cause. When Rees departed to Siloah, Llanelli, in early 1842, the original proposal was abandoned but a small group of members from Ebenezer continued to hold meetings, but in the Welsh language. The leading figure was David Price, who had recently moved to Aberdare from the Vale of Neath. At his instigation meeting began to be held in the long room of the Boot Inn, Aberdare. In 1843, fourteen members from Ebenezer, Trecynon, the oldest independent church in the district, sought to be released to establish a new church. Despite the reservations of some older members the request was approved and the new church was named, Siloa, in deference to their former minister's new church in Llanelli. Amongst the original members was David Price, who played an active and direct role in the construction of the original building. The first building cost ¬£600. The pastorate of David Price, 1843‚Äì78 Soon after, David Price was ordained as the minister at Siloa, and served as its treasurer for many years. David Price began life as a working miner, and during the Aberdare Strike of 1857‚Äì8 he appeared on a platform alongside Henry Austin Bruce, translating his comments into Welsh and relating his own experiences as a young miner on strike many years before in an attempt to persuade the miners to return to work. His views reflected the antipathy of nonconformist leaders towards trade unionism at the time. Siloa was established at the very time when Aberdare was rapidly developing as an industrial settlement as a result of the growth of the steam coal trade. During Price's pastorate, large numbers of migrants, notably from the rural counties of Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, Pembrokeshire and Breconshire, stimulated the rapid growth of the membership at Siloa to over 600, making it the most numerous church in the valley in terms of membership by the 1860s. In addition to the membership increase as a result of industrial development, numbers received a considerable boost as a result of the Religious Revival of 1849 and Siloa was rebuilt and enlarged in 1855 at a cost of ¬£719. After the further Religious Revival of 1859, there was another boost in membership and the debts were cleared by 1860. Siloa played an important role in the rise of political radicalism in the nineteenth century, a movement that was closely connected with nonconformity. In 1848 a notable meeting was held at Siloa, chaired by David Williams (Alaw Goch) to protest against the evidence submitted to the commissioners preparing the 1847 Education Reports by the vicar of Aberdare, John Griffith. Thomas Price, minister of neighbouring Calfaria played a prominent part at this meeting. Several churches were established as branches of Siloa at Price's instigation, including Bethesda, Abernant, where he also served as pastor, and Bryn Seion, Cwmbach. Members of Siloa were also involved with the formation of churches at Mountain Ash, Aberaman, Cwmaman and Cwmdare. In 1866, the church presented Price with an address and a gift of ¬£170, raised solely by members of the church, in recognition of his services. Price died in 1878 at the age of 68. The pastorate of Silyn Evans, 1880‚Äì1930 Silyn Evans succeeded David Price and later wrote his biography. Siloa had 661 members in 1899 and, in the wake of the Religious Revival, this had increased to 761 by 1907. Extensive renovations were carried out in 1890 at a cost of ¬£1,100. Jubilee services to celebrate the clearing of the debts incurred by this work were held in January 1905 and coincided with the Revival. In 1918, there was controversy over a decision by the church to withhold contributions to the Bala Bangor Theological College owing to the pacifist views of its principal, Thomas Rees. By 1923 the membership had fallen to 645. 20th century Membership at Siloa numbered 501 in 1933 when R. Ifor Parry commenced his ministry. By 1954 the membership had fallen to 363, with a further sharp decline to 1961, when Parry resigned his ministry. In August of 1969, the Reverend Aneurin Owen Roberts became the minister of Siloa. Services continued in Welsh and membership stabilized for some years, especially as families were warmly welcomed and the children were in charge of one Sunday morning service every month. The Reverend Roberts was the main organizer on the Cor Mawr Caradog Centennial celebrations in October of 1972. But the downward chapel-membership trend that was affecting the whole of Wales continued after a while and, from 1980 services have been held in the vestry due to the sharp decline in the number of churchgoers. In contrast to other churches in the valley, however, Siloa has continued to function as a Welsh language church, even after the retirement in 1987 of Reverend Roberts, Siloa's last full-time minister.

She was built for the Imperial German Navy for overseas duty. The cruiser's keel was laid down in Danzig in 1890; she was launched in May 1892 and commissioned in July 1893. Cormoran was armed with a main battery of eight guns, and could steam at a speed of . Cormoran spent the majority of her career abroad, usually in Germany's South Pacific colonies in the Samoan Islands. Her duties there typically consisted of survey work and suppressing colonial unrest. She briefly cruised in South African waters in late 1894 and early 1895 before steaming to the Pacific. She participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in the Shandong Peninsula in China in 1897. Cormoran returned to Germany in 1903 and was modernized in 1907-08\\\\. The following year, she returned to the South Pacific, where she remained until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Docked in Tsingtau for repairs at the onset of hostilities, she was unable to actively take part in the fighting. She was therefore disarmed and scuttled in the harbor; her guns were used to strengthen the defenses of the port.

The gun armament was rounded out by five Hotchkiss guns.Gardiner, p. 253 She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes, both of which were mounted on the deck. Service history Cormoran was built by the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Her keel was laid in 1890 and her completed hull was launched on 17 May 1892. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the launching ceremony with the senior director of the Kaiserliche Werft.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 193 Work was completed by 25 July 1893, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. Following her commissioning, she underwent two months of sea trials, which were completed on 22 September. Starting in 1894, Cormoran was assigned to overseas service in Germany's colonial possessions.Gr√∂ner, p. 98 She was initially ordered on 2 October to the East Asia Station to replace the gunboat , but the rising tensions in South Africa led the Navy to send the new cruiser to German East Africa to secure German interests in the region instead. On 16 October, Cormoran and her newly commissioned sister ship left Germany, bound for East Africa. They arrived in Louren√ßo Marques, the capital of Portuguese Mozambique, on 15 December. Cormoran remained there for the next seven months. In January 1895, she towed the Portuguese cruiser Afonso de Albuquerque back to Louren√ßo Marques. In July, Condor arrived there to replace Cormoran; the latter was now free to return to her original deployment to East Asian waters. She left East Africa on 5 July. While en route, she stopped in Muscat, Oman, where she paid an official visit to the sultan. On 5 August while steaming in the Strait of Hormuz, the safety valve on the starboard low-pressure cylinder of the starboard engine was damaged. As a result, Cormoran had to put into Bushehr, Persia, for repairs. Following completion of the repair work, Cormoran cruised to Basra via the Shatt al-Arab, where she paid visits to the local German consul and Turkish authorities. =First deployment to the Pacific= Korvettenkapit√§n Hugo Emsmann, Cormorans commander, aboard the ship in May 1899 On 13 September 1895, Cormoran arrived in Singapore and joined the East Asia Division under the command of Rear Admiral Hoffmann, who flew his flag in the armored cruiser . In July 1896, she participated in the recovery of the stranded gunboat . In October and November 1897, Cormoran steamed up the Yangtze River to Hankow. She was also involved in the occupation of the Kiautschou Bay concession. She went to the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in May 1898; the American cruiser prevented Cormoran from entering Cavite. In November, she towed Kaiser from Samsah Bay in Fujian to Hong Kong for repairs. The tense political situation in German Samoa prompted the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) to send Cormoran to reinforce her sisters and there. While en route to Samoa on the night of 23-24 March 1899, Cormoran ran aground on the Whirlwind Reef, north of the western tip of New Pomerania. She was stuck on the reef amidships, so that her bow was sticking about a meter out of the water. The crew attempted to lighten the ship by removing coal and ammunition, but she remained grounded on the reef. The ship's commander, Korvettenkapit√§n Hugo Emsmann, sent the steam pinnace and a dinghy with two officers and eleven men, towing a load of coal, to Friedrich- Wilhelmshafen, some away. There, they met the steamer , which arrived on the scene on 29 March. Emsmann then decided to remove all unnecessary coal and ammunition--some of which was put ashore and the rest simply thrown overboard --to cut away the fore and mainmast, and to move the stern guns forward. These measures allowed the ship to float free from the reef.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 193-194 The crew then re-stowed the supplies that had been sent ashore before returning to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen. There, her seaworthiness was inspected, and additional supplies were brought aboard. Cormoran then steamed to Sydney for dry-docking; a full inspection of her hull revealed that it had only been slightly damaged. Repairs lasted until early June.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 194 Cormoran returned to Sydney in mid-June 1900 for her annual overhaul. Part of her crew was replaced; these men were then sent to China to take part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. On 2 October, Cormoran anchored in Apia, before embarking on a tour of the German Pacific colonies. Another overhaul in Sydney followed, which lasted from 15 March to 1 May 1901. During this period, she and the protected cruiser represented Germany during the first Parliament of Australia in Melbourne. While on the return journey to Samoa, Cormoran was sent to the St Matthias Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, where a German researcher named Mencke had been murdered, along with his assistant. There, Cormoran and the survey vessel attacked the islanders responsible for the murders. On 28 July, Cormoran had returned to Apia, and through November, the ship was occupied with survey work and trips to the other islands. In 1902, she again visited the Bismarck Archipelago and the Marshall Islands. Further repairs were effected in Sydney, and the cruiser was back in Apia by 18 August. Another tour of Germany's colonies began on 23 September. She returned to Sydney for periodic maintenance in mid-March 1903, and there she received the order to return to Germany. Cormoran departed Sydney on 23 May, bound for Germany; she reached Kiel on 13 September. While in Germany, she served a stint in the main fleet. The ship was modernized during a lengthy reconstruction that started in 1907 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. New boilers manufactured by J W Klawitter in Danzig were installed, and her sailing rig was reduced. A new, larger conning tower was also installed. Work was completed in 1908,Gr√∂ner, pp. 97-98 and on 1 May 1909, Cormoran was recommissioned for service in the Pacific. =Second deployment to the Pacific= Cormoran in drydock in Sydney While in Malta on 8 June 1909, she received orders to proceed to Asia Minor, where unrest in Turkey and violence against Armenians was prompting German intervention. She joined the cruisers and , and took on some 300 Armenians to protect them from harassment. On 9 July, while moored in Port Said, she received the order to resume her voyage to the Pacific. Cormoran was forced to stop in Jeddah for repairs to her boilers. After reaching the Pacific, she began coastal survey work, and her landing party led a punitive expedition against cannibals in Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. On 3 November, she took part in a flag raising ceremony in Blanche Bay commemorating the German possession of New Pomerania. Three days later, her crew participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for a Bismarck tower in Toma, a town southwest of the capital, Herbertsh√∂he.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 194-195 On 13 November, Cormoran embarked the governor in Herbertsh√∂he, and went first to Friedrich- Wilhelmshafen, then to Hansa-Hafen, and then to the Kaiserin-Augusta River. The cruiser steamed up the river before being ordered to reverse course. By 22 November, she had reached the mouth of the river, and by 8 January 1910, she had moored in Apia once again. She participated in the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the German annexation of the islands, which lasted from 28 February to 3 March. While on a trip to Hong Kong, she was caught in a hurricane, which did significant damage to the cruiser. Her sides were slightly pushed in and all of her boats were damaged by the storm. Temporary repairs were effected in Noum√©a in New Caledonia. Cormoran finally arrived in Hong Kong on 3 May; by 15 July, she had returned to Apia. She was thereafter joined by her sister Condor, the armored cruiser and the light cruisers and from the East Asia Squadron. The five ships cruised together until, on 13 December while in Rabaul, they were ordered to proceed to Ponape to suppress the Sokehs Rebellion. They arrived on 19 December and operated in the area until 22 February, with Cormoran, Emden and N√ºrnberg landing shore parties in support of Polizei-Soldaten (a force of police officers) deployed from German New Guinea.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 195de Quesada, p. 21 On 23 March, Cormoran returned to Sydney for yet another annual overhaul. Afterward, she resumed her typical cruising duties in the German Pacific colonies. In September, she and the steamer Planet pulled free the Norwegian barque Fram, which had run aground. She received another major overhaul in Tsingtau in May 1912, which was followed by surveying cruises in the German colonies. She did not return to Apia until 10 January 1913. Cormoran was reclassified as a gunboat on 24 February 1913 by order of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office). From 4 June to 5 July, she underwent repairs in Sydney. She was then obliged to stop in Bougainville due to tribal feuds on the island. She landed her shore party to assist the Polizeitruppen in suppressing the conflict. She departed for Tsingtau for further repair work in early 1914, arriving on 30 May. As the political situation in Europe worsened in July 1914, the senior officer in Tsingtau at the time, Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Karl von M√ºller, the commander of Emden, ordered the repair work to Cormoran to be accelerated. After the outbreak of war in early August, Emden captured the Russian steamer Ryazan and brought her back to Tsingtau. Since Cormoran was still out of service, she was decommissioned and her crew was used to man Ryazan, which was commissioned as the auxiliary cruiser . Men from the gunboats and , along with some war volunteers, joined them aboard the new auxiliary cruiser.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 196 Much of her weaponry was removed to strengthen the shore defenses at Tsingtau on 6 August 1914 to protect the concession from British attack. She was scuttled in the harbor on the night of 28-29 September 1914 by the staff of the Imperial Dockyard to prevent her from being captured.

It was developed in the late 1960s as part of an urban renewal project that also included construction of two high rises. As of 2013 plans were going forward for a major overhaul. Location The plaza was built on the site of a five-story flour mill built by Dr. Eliakim Crosby in 1831. A diversion dam was built on the Little Cuyahoga River in Middlebury, from which a canal brought water south down the present Main Street, turning right at Mill Street to deliver power to the mill at Lock Five, where the plaza's hotel is now. The canal also powered other factories. The hamlet of Cascade grew up in the area, with a population of 128 by July 1833, compared to 329 for Akron. The Flatiron Building, a seven-story low rise built in 1907 and demolished in 1967 also stood on the site. Plaza The plaza lies on the west side of South Main Street, and forms the roof of a five-level underground parking lot. Lawrence Halprin planned the Cascade Plaza. It was a major urban renewal project covering and featuring a central skating rink. The plaza has a fountain sculpture designed by Don Drumm and erected in 1968, overleaf, stainless steel rods with anodized, cast aluminum panels. Buildings There are four buildings on the site, linked at the ground level by the plaza: Akron City Center Hotel, Cascade I, Cascade III and Huntington Tower. The hotel (formerly the Radisson Hotel Akron City Centre) is a 19-story modernist high rise complete in 1969. Cascade I, at One Cascade Plaza and 140 South Main Street, is also called the PNC Center. It is a 23-story steel high-rise completed in 1969. Three Cascade Plaza is a seven-story concrete low-rise. Huntington Tower, at 106 South Main Street, is a 27-story steel tower with an art deco brick facade completed in 1931. Plans In October 2013 the Akron City Council voted to approve a complete overhaul of the plaza, partly funded by the city and partly by FirstMerit Corporation, a bank. The plan was to demolish the concrete plaza, then reseal the deck and convert it to green space, open to the street. The new space would have plants, benches and tables.

The rocks tower above the town by around 70 metres and are crowned by a type of summit cross at a height of . The rocks is the symbol of the town and the subject of an ancient legend from which it derives its name: Jungfernsprung means \\"maiden's leap\\".  Location and structure  The Jungfernsprung lies in the eastern part of the borough. Its west and north faces rise, steep and ruggedly, from the slopes on the left-hand side of the Wieslauter valley, whilst the residential area of Dahn spreads out southwest of the rocks on both sides of its base. The rocks belong to the many bunter sandstone formations, typical of the Wasgau region, the southern part of the Palatine Forest in Germany and the northern part of the Vosges in France. Because the area around Dahn is especially rich in such rock features it is also called the Dahner Felsenland (\\"Dahn Rock Country\\"). The Jungfernsprung ‚Äì like other rock formations in the region ‚Äì is a harder rock that has withstood erosion better than the surrounding softer material.  Legend of the Jungfernsprung  The legend, whose most common version comes from local author, August Becker (1857), goes like this: :Once a young maiden ventured into the Forest of Dahn to pick berries. When she was far away from home, a man suddenly burst out of the thicket, probably the robber baron, Hans Trapp from Berwartstein Castle. The man clearly intended to rob the virgin of her innocence. So the young maiden gathered up her skirts and took to flight, but the villain came ever closer to her. In her panic, the young lass failed to watch where she was going. All of a sudden she found herself, panting for breath, at the edge of the precipice with the houses of the town far below. Without stopping to think, the young maiden fell over the abyss. And now the miracle happened: because her skirts ballooned out and let her float down gently, she survived the leap entirely unhurt. And ever since, at the spot where her foot landed, a spring has flowed. More about the fate of the maiden and villain is not recorded, however this story was sufficient for the time to explain the steepness of the rock and the existence of the spring. Artists have occasionally been inspired to portray the dramatic \\"maiden's leap\\". In doing so they clearly always used the idea of someone parachuting as a model, the outspread skirts of the maiden enabling a visual interpretation of the miracle and at the same time representing an attractive artistic subject.  Hiking destination and climbing rocks  The Jungfernsprung is accessible to hikers from the rear; the access footpath being part of the premier hiking trail, the Felsenland Legend Trail (Felsenland Sagenweg). In summer the rocks are part of the South Palatinate Climbing Area and thus a popular destination for sport climbers. The spectacular Franz Seiler Memorial Route (Franz-Seiler- Ged√§chtnisweg) rates as climbing grade VII+ (UIAA). it runs up the vertical face of the rock and is visible from the town.

A former police officer, he is also the executive director and business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association (SLPOA). SLPOA is Lodge #68 of the Fraternal Order of Police, covering the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD). Early life and education Jeff Roorda was born in St. Louis, Missouri on March 30, 1965, the oldest of two sons. He lived in St. Louis with his parents and younger brother until he was twelve years old when Roorda's family moved to Arnold, a St. Louis suburb in Jefferson County, Missouri. Roorda graduated from Windsor High School in Jefferson County. Roorda received an associate degree in Criminal Justice from Jefferson College in Hillsboro, Missouri and later went on to earn his bachelor's degree from Missouri Baptist University and his Masters in Public Policy Administration from University of Missouri - St. Louis. Roorda married his wife Nancy in 1994. They have three daughters. Career Roorda has worked in law enforcement for seventeen years.

Later, he became chief of police in Kimmswick, another city in Jefferson County. He is the executive director and a business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. =Politics= Roorda was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2004 as a Democrat in district 102, representing the Imperial, Missouri area.

He was defeated in November by Republican Dennis Gannon by a 58%-42% margin. State Legislator In March 2010, Roorda got in a heated exchange on the House floor with Republican Rep. Tim Jones. While Roorda was speaking critically about the GOP budget proposal, Jones accused him of skipping out on floor votes and called him a liar. The two started shouting and moving toward one another as colleagues kept them apart until the situation calmed down. Both later apologized for their behavior In 2013 and 2014, Roorda introduced the Thanksgiving Family Protection Act, which would have blocked most retail stores from opening on Thanksgiving Day, saying that \\"[t]he commercialization of Christmas has now crept into Thanksgiving Day, when folks would like to be home celebrating with their families.\\" This bill did not advance either time. In 2014, Roorda sponsored a bill that, if passed, would have allowed the government to close \\"any records and documents pertaining to police shootings [...] if they contain the name of any officer who did the shooting, unless the officer who did the shooting has been charged with a crime as a result of the shooting, in which case such records or documents shall not be closed.\\" The bill did not advance. =SLPOA business manager= Roorda said the St. Louis Police Officers Association has had concerns about dashboard cameras in use on many city patrol cars and would have the same worries about on-body devices. Roorda said both types of cameras provide video of \\"one angle of an encounter\\" that sometimes doesn't reflect exactly what happened. \\"In general, cameras have been bad for law enforcement and the communities they protect,\\" he said. \\"It causes constant second-guessing by the courts and the media.\\" In January 2015, Roorda, wearing an \\"I am Darren Wilson\\" bracelet, was involved in a fracas at a meeting of the Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis when he had a run- in with a woman as he was approaching and arguing with the aldermen. The woman alleges minor injuries and the union removed Roorda as its spokesperson on matters regarding a proposed Civilian Oversight Board, about which the aforementioned meeting was hearing public testimony. In August 2016 the St. Louis County Police Association terminated its contract with Roorda as business manager, although he continued with the St. Louis city police union. The woman who Roorda allegedly assaulted in 2015 in December 2016 filed a lawsuit against him and in February 2017 the SLPOA was added to the suit. Leading St. Louis mayoral candidate Lyda Krewson in February 2017 called for Roorda to be fired as city police union representative following an inflammatory and racially tinged personal attack against mayoral candidate Tishaura Jones. Jones and other candidates had previously called for the ouster of Roorda. =After Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson= Roorda has helped with the fundraising for Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who was under investigation for the controversial killing of Michael Brown, and Roorda repeatedly publicly defended Wilson. Roorda made numerous appearances on CNN and other news networks, in interviews and on panels, after the Brown shooting to defend police and criticize protesters, often making controversial statements. He has also written two books: Ferghanistan: The War on Police (JCR Strategic Consultants LLC, November 2015) of which a \\"generous\\" portion of the profits was promised to Wilson, and The War on Police: How the Ferguson Effect Is Making America Unsafe (WND Books, November 2016). Roorda demanded an apology from the NFL following a public display of protest by several members of the St. Louis Rams. Roorda in July 2016 was sharply criticized by the Ethical Society of Police, St. Louis Alderwoman Cara Spencer, and others for an incendiary graphic and remarks about the shooting of officers in Dallas.

The River Walk begins just south of the mouth of the Black River and continues to the Seaway Terminal. It is less than a mile south of the Blue Water Bridge to Sarnia and the southern end of Lake Huron. The Blue Water River Walk includes a naturalized shoreline made up of natural rocks, boulders and pebbles. Native plants, flowers, trees and shrubs growing in a natural landscape make up the habitat onshore. The River Walk provides a place for natural habitat to thrive and for visitors to take a walk along the shoreline and enjoy looking for turtles, having a picnic, and watching freighters.  History  The Blue Water River Walk is owned privately by the Community Foundation of St. Clair County through one of its subsidiary companies, the Blue Water Land Fund. The entire stretch of shoreline was given to the Community Foundation by local philanthropists James and Suzanne Acheson in 2011. In return for the gift, the Foundation promised to find the funding necessary to finish the restoration and rehabilitation of the shoreline, and promised to make it available to the public forever. In essence, the Foundation has turned the shoreline into a \\"public\\" park. The shoreline encompasses more than 70 acres of what is now prime waterfront property. The property, known as Desmond Landing, hosts the maritime center, a farmers' market in the summer, fireworks displays and other events. The Blue Water River Walk features offshore reefs, new wildlife habitat, a restored ferry dock and a pedestrian trail. St. Clair County Parks will be developing a wetlands area at the south end of the trail, and the City of Port Huron has expanded the Bridge to Bay Trail to connect with the Blue Water River Walk Trail. In Fall of 2012, the Community Foundation, the Blue Water Land Fund and other federal, state and local officials held a ground‚Äìbreaking ceremony at the site of the Blue Water River Walk. Senator Debbie Stabenow and Congresswomen Candice Miller addressed the crowd and expressed their support of the project. An official grand opening of the River Walk was held on June 7, 2014. The Community Foundation of St. Clair County was originally created in 1944. Today it is the largest grant‚Äìmaking foundation in Michigan's Thumb Region and serves to help donors manage their charitable and philanthropic giving.  Features  = Offshore reefs = Some of the offshore reefsPerhaps the most striking different aspect of the new St. Clair River shoreline along the Blue Water River Walk is the huge stone and boulder structures sticking up from the water just offshore. These huge offshore reefs extend down almost 15 feet into the river bottom. The large boulders seen on the surface weigh as much as 4,000 pounds. They are resting on two other layers; recycled slabs of cement on the very bottom and a middle layer of smaller boulders. All together, over 8,000 tons of rock, stone, cement and boulders were used to build these reefs. These offshore reefs are a critical element to the overall naturalization of the St. Clair River shoreline. Their purpose is twofold: first, they will help knock down the incredibly strong wave energy caused by passing boats. Left unchecked, those waves would cause serious damage to the new plants and habitat along the shoreline. Secondly, they create new shallow water habitat between the reefs and the shoreline. This habitat is critical to the growth and development of small fish, reptiles and amphibians. Much of the upper St. Clair River is lacking in shallow water habitat for fish and wildlife. These reefs have helped create new shallow water habitat along almost one mile of shoreline. = Habitats = A number of different natural features have been added to the shoreline: these include new plant habitat, basking logs for turtles, snake dens, and bird houses. As of summer 2015, visitors can experience a natural wetlands park along the southern part of the river walk. This large component is led and owned by St. Clair County Parks & Recreation. = Ferry dock = Restored Ferry Dock Along the Blue Water River Walk is an old railroad ferry dock. This ferry dock has been completely restored and made available as a place to view the St. Clair River. The decking is made of Brazilian walnut and new railings, lighting, and stairs have been added. An old functioning railroad signal light welcomes visitors to the ferry dock. = Pedestrian trail = Pedestrian trailA 10' wide asphalt trail runs the entire length of the Blue Water River Walk. For safety, bollards (posts) have been placed along the west edge of the trail to keep vehicles off the trail. These posts came from the old ferry dock fender (big wall) that was cut down in 2013. All of the old posts were separated and sorted and then cut to length to use on the trail. This trail is a key component in the Bridge to Bay Trail‚Äîa trail that runs more than 50 miles from Lakeport State Park to New Baltimore. = Fishing pier = A fishing pier was added along the river walk in June 2015. Phase I of the project opened to the public July 4, 2015. This pier allows area anglers to cast their line 65 feet off shore. Phase II will be added at a later date. = Public art = During the summer of 2014, two pieces of public art were added to help tell the history of the Blue Water Area and to make the river walk more appealing to visitors. Stella Clair is a 1,500 lb. metal sturgeon that was fabricated by Michigan native Lou Rodriquez. Lake sturgeon can weigh anywhere between 30 and 100 pounds. There are an estimated 30,000 adult sturgeon at the mouth of the St. Clair River. Nine reefs were installed in the middle channel of the St. Clair River to provide places for sturgeon spawning, in an effort to increase the fish population in the river. Sugar, the Iron Horse is another piece of public art installed in 2014. Sugar is a 7-foot-tall horse created by artist James Oleson. Oleson is a sculptor and painter from Florida who has work placed all over the United States.

A major component of the Socialist romanticism, Frayerman is best remembered as a children's literature author, whose novel Wild Dog Dingo or the Tale of the First Love (1939) became a popular Soviet film in 1962. Biography Ruvim Isayevich Frayerman was born in Mogilyov, to a poor Jewish family. In 1916 he enrolled into the Kharkov Technological Institute. A year later, as he was taking industrial practice at the Russian Far East the 1917 Revolution broke out. Frayerman joined the Red partisan unit fighting the Japanese troops nearby Nikolayevsk, then as a commissar travelled through Siberia, helping to maintain the Bolshevik rule in the regions inhabited by Tungus, Nivkh and Nanai people. Having settled in Yakutsk, he joined the staff of the local Lensky Kommunar newspaper. Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, whom Frayerman met in Novosibirsk, invited him to join the newly formed Sibirskiye Ogni (Lights of Siberia) magazine, where his first short novel Ognyovka was published in 1924, followed by Na Mysu (At the Cape, 1925), Sobolya (Sables, 1926) and a large poem Na Rassvete (At the Dawn, 1926). Many of Frayerman's works of the time ‚Äì notably, Vaska-Gilyak (1929), Afanasy Oleshek (1933) and The Misfortunes of An-Senen (1935) ‚Äì dealt with the life of the native peoples of Siberia, whom the author formed strong bonds with. In 1939 Frayerman published his best-known novel Wild Dog Dingo or the Tale of the First Love (Dikaya Sobaka Dingo ili Povest o Pervoy Lyubvi). The film shot in 1962 by Yuly Karasik has been seen by 21.8 million people. As the Great Patriotic War broke out, Frayerman joined the Red Army volunteer corps. In January 1942 he was seriously injured and in May demobilized. In 1946 his novel Long Sea Voyage (Dalneye Plavaniye) came out, followed by The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Captain-Lieutenant Golovkin (1948, with P.Zaykin as a co-author), a biography turned into a thriller. Among Frayerman's later books were Children's Best-Loved Author (Lyubimy Pisatel Detei, 1954, on Arkady Gaidar) and A Test for Soul (Ispytanye Dushi, 1966), the collection of sketches and essays.

CodeXL has been mainly developed by AMD. With version 2.0 CodeXL was made part of GPUOpen and is free and open- source software subject to the requirements of the MIT License. It is no longer branded as an AMD product. Cpu profiler and Power profiler were included in CodeXL until version 2.5. Now these profilers are released as part of AMD uProf tool.  Features  = GPU debugger = CodeXL's GPU debugger allows engineers to debug OpenGL and OpenCL API calls and runtime objects, and debug OpenCL kernels: set breakpoints, step through source code in real-time, view all variables across different GPU cores during kernel execution, identify logic and memory errors, reduce memory transaction overhead, visualize OpenCL/OpenGL buffers and images and OpenGL textures as pictures or as spreadsheet data, and in this way to improve general software quality and optimize its performance. = GPU profiler = CodeXL's GPU profiler collects and visualizes hardware performance counters data, application trace, kernel occupancy, and offers hotspot analysis for AMD GPUs and APUs. The profiler gathers data from the OpenCL runtime, and from the GPU/APU itself during the execution of the kernels, and can be used to discover performance bottlenecks and optimize kernel execution. = CPU profiler = AMD uProf supersedes the CodeXL for CPU and Power Profiling functionalities on AMD processors. CodeXL's CPU profiling suite can be used to identify, investigate and improve the performance of applications, drivers and system software on AMD CPUs. CodeXL's CPU profiler uses a statistical sampling based approach with various profiling techniques and measures: Time-Based Profiling (TBP), Event-Based Profiling (EBP), Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS) and CPU hardware performance monitors. The CodeXL CPU profiler replaces AMD CodeAnalyst. = Static Shader/Kernel Analyzer = CodeXL's static kernel analyzer allows engineers to compile, analyze and disassemble the code of DirectX, OpenGL and Vulkan shaders and OpenCL kernels. The tool provides performance estimation for each shader/kernel on different kinds of AMD chips, without actually executing the code. This way, the tool assists in fine-tuning to achieve best performance on AMD GPUs.http://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/amd-codexl- analyzercli/http://gpuopen.com/up-and-running-with-codexl-analyzer-cli/  Radeon GPU Analyzer (RGA)  In Q1 2017, AMD CodeXL Analyzer was replaced by Radeon GPU Analyzer (RGA), maintaining backward compatibility. Radeon GPU Analyzer CLI is an offline compiler and a performance analysis tool for DirectX shaders, OpenGL shaders, Vulkan shaders and OpenCL kernels.https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/RGA = HSA profiler = With version 2.0 the CodeXL HSA Profiler and HSAIL Kernel Debugger support the Boltzmann initiative driver, on GCN 1.2 hardware (i.e. Radeon R9 Fury, Fury X and Fury Nano, and \\"Carrizo\\" APUs. = Graphics Frame Analyzer = The Frame Analyzer can collect and display a frame timeline for applications that use Microsoft DirectX 12 or Vulkan. The analyzer's view lists each API call that was made on the CPU side and its corresponding command that executed on the GPU side in an inter-linked and unified timeline view, as well as aggregated statistics for user-selected specific time fragment ‚Äì cumulative time for each type of API, number of calls, 20 longest calls and more.

The peers or their representatives were invited to provide evidence to support their claims. The resultant \\"decreet\\" was registered in the books of the Privy Council and passed to the Lord Clerk Register and the Lord Lyon, to be used to determine predecence on all future occasions.

They are served on special occasions such as weddings, housewarmings, or ordinations. They confer blessings on the recipient. To deliver all the blessings at one time, the nine desserts are offered together on one tray. History Turning back to the past when Thailand was called ‚ÄúSiam‚Äù, it traded with other countries such as China or India for a long time. And they supported each other about trade including exchanging culture and food. Siam had a lot of friendships with other countries, they obtained and adapted food culture of other countries to suit their local condition. The ingredients or equipment included in food habits of Thai people made the new generation not be able to separate what is the real Thai dessert and what is adapted from the other food culture. For example the dessert that is made from egg yolk or baked came in to Siam in reign of King Narai by Maria Guyomar de Pinha or Thao Thong Kip Ma. Maria Guyomar was a Siamese woman of mixed Japanese-Portuguese-Bengali ancestry, she is known in Thailand for having introduced new dessert recipes in Siamese cuisine at the Ayutthaya court. Some of her dishes were influenced by Portuguese cuisine especially egg yolk-based sweets such as foi thong or thong yot. Siam not only received the dessert but gave precedence to those desserts by using them to be kind of auspicious dessert with the others. Every kind of nine auspicious Thai desserts has a good meaning that is why they are favored to be used in auspicious ceremony. Thong yot Thong yot is described as a sister of thong yip, due to the similarity in ingredients even though the form is different. Thong yod means \\"golden drop\\". It augurs wealth for the person who is served it. Foi thong Foi thong uses the same ingredients as thong yip and thong yot. Foi thong means \\"golden noodle\\" or \\"golden yarn\\".

Thong ek means \\"the one and only\\", \\"tops\\", \\"the best\\". It is conveys a blessing for a fruitful career. Met khanun Met khanun is made from mashed green bean coated with egg yolks. The name med khanun comes from its shape, which looks like jackfruit (khanun) seed (med). It symbolizes the support one will receive in one's career and in life. Cha mongkut Cha mongkut is a dessert made from incense-scented flour, bean flour, sugar, coconut milk, and roasted watermelon seed which looks like \\"kalamae\\" invented 200 years ago in the era of King Rama II. Ja mongkut means the \\"owner of the crown\\", the top position. There is confusion between cha mongkut and dara thong. Dara thong is a crown-like dessert made of flour, egg yolk, sugar, gold leaf, roasted watermelon seeds, and jasmine-scented water, invented by Dame Jue Nakornrachaseni around 1938. Khanom sane chan The ingredients of khanom sane chan are two kinds of flour, eggs, coconut milk, sugar, and nutmeg. Named after a fruit called \\"luk chan\\" which has good looking form and great odor. Saneh chan means \\"charming Chan\\". It assures the receiver of love, adoration, and charm, mostly used in wedding ceremonies. Khanom chan khanom chan means layer dessert. Khanom chan consists of tapioca flour, rice flour, arrowroot flour, coconut milk, sugar, and jasmine-scented water.

Murphy\\" Omaha World Herald, 12-19-1970; Page: 14  Notable cases  As a district court judge, Murphy occasionally heard capital cases, cases where the death penalty was an allowed punishment. One prominent example was in the case of the slaying of 86-year-old Anna Dunning by William Henry Kauffman and Walter Edward Frans, who together plead guilty and received instead sentences of life in prison.\\"Judge Gives 2 Life Terms\\", Omaha World Herald, Date: 06-29-1964; Page: 1 In 1967, Omaha began its attempt to annex Millard, which quickly escalated to a legal battle, which Murphy oversaw in the district courts. The case escalated, eventually going to the US Supreme Court (which refused the case), and Millard was finally annexed in 1971. On October 16, Robert Julian Jacobs (AKA Anthony Ruiz) stabbed to death 12-year-old Allen Schmidt and stabbed Allen's brother Leslie during a sex-related attack. Murphy presided over the trial in which Jacobs pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was found guilty of first degree murder in a trial without a jury (no jury was at the request of the defense). Murphy's sentence was especially unique. He stated that he was very close to sentencing Jacobs to the death penalty, but felt that Jacobs \\"abnormal\\" mental and emotional state led him to spare Jacobs' life. He stated that he did not endorse abolition of the death penalty, as that would be a legislative matter, and that the death penalty was a fit punishment for those convicted of a hired killing, for inmates who killed guards, for mass killers such as those who bomb airlines, and for \\"many other kinds\\". Instead Murphy sentenced Jacobs to two life sentences plus 50 years with the special provision that Jacobs be placed in solitary confinement for 24 hours every year on the anniversary of the murder.\\"Jacobs was 'Close' to Penalty of Death\\", Omaha World Herald, 03-11-1972; Page: 16 In jail, Jacobs attacked other inmates and was not allowed into the general population. He committed suicide in his cell on October 21, 1972, about 8 months after sentencing.\\"Boy's Killer Found Dead in Cell\\", Omaha World Herald, 10-22-1973; Page: 20 = Mayor Dworak bribery case = One of the most important political cases Judge Murphy presided over was a case accusing Mayor James Dworak of soliciting bribes. Dworak was first elected mayor in a tight race in 1961. His tenure was rocky, and during his re-election campaign in 1965 he was taped asking for a $25,000 campaign contribution in exchange for not vetoing a rezoning application of Chicago developer John B. Coleman. Dworak lost his bid for re-election while under indictment. The following spring he was acquitted by the jury, his main defense being that he was stringing Coleman along and.\\"Dworak is Found Not Guilty of Soliciting $25,000 Bribe\\", Omaha World Herald, 02-03-1966; Page 1 Murphy presided over the cases of the four other men indicted under similar accusations.

James Exon.\\"Brodkey, 64, Is New Judge in High Court\\", Omaha World Herald, 03-14-1974; Page: 1 In 1978 Murphy announced plans to step down from the district court in favor of a position as an administrative law judge for the Social Security Division of the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

Responsible genes The largest contribution to the pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes comes from a single locus called IDDM1, which comes from several genes located in the Major histocompatibility complex on the 6p21.3 chromosome. This is believed to be responsible for at least 40% of the disease's familial aggregation. Additionally, nearly 30% of Type I Diabetes patients are heterozygous for several HLA-DQ2 (specifically HLA-DQ2/DQ8) alleles. However, the HLA-DQ6 allele (HLA-DQA1*0102‚ÄìDQB1*0602), if dominant, is responsible for partially preventing an organism from developing the disease. Therefore, these genetic features can be used to determine a patient's relative risk of developing the disease. Further discussion and research of the functional genomics of the pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes will be necessary in future studies in this field.

The succession was unchallenged, and Said took possession of the capital, Rustaq. His brothers Saif and Sultan bin Ahmad called on Sheikh Sakar of the Shemal tribal group to help them gain the throne. Sheikh Sakar took the towns of Hamra, Shargah, Rams and Khor Fakan. Said fought back, but was unable to regain these towns. However, Saif and Sultan felt it was too dangerous for them to stay in Oman. Saif sailed for East Africa, intending to set himself up as a ruler there. He died there soon after. Sultan escaped to Gwadar on the Makran coast of Balochistan. Deposition The Imam was increasingly unpopular. Around the end of 1785 a group of notables elected his brother, Qais bin Ahmad, Imam. This revolt soon collapsed. Later one of Said‚Äòs sons was held prisoner in Fort Al Jalali for a period by the governor of Muscat. Another son, Hamad bin Said, came to negotiate with the governor. Hamad and his followers managed to gain control of forts al-Jalali and al-Mirani, and thus of Muscat. This happened in 1786. One by one the other fortresses in Oman submitted to Hamad, until Said no longer had any temporal power. Hamad took the title of Sheikh and established his court in Muscat.

The system consists of the five planets Zao, Olymbris, Thoorana, Zephrondus and Gulzund. Kellory the Warlock takes place on Zephrondus. Kellory is the last survivor of the Black Wolves tribe, descended from the Lost Kings of Illyriod. His people were massacred by the Thugoda Horde, who burned his father alive and held his own sword hand in the same fire so he could live to tell the tale but never raise a sword against his tormentors. He dedicates his life to revenge against the horde, becoming a warlock since he is no longer able to be a warrior. In time, he achieves his dark goal. Contents *1.

It is promoted by Kopter as being a clean-sheet design amongst a market sector dominated by decades-old airframe designs. The prototype first flew on 2 October 2014. On 28 January 2020, Italian helicopter manufacturer Leonardo announced that it will acquire Kopter during 2020, for $185 million, plus bonuses. At the time Kopter employed 320 people. Development =Origins= In 2002, Martin Stucki, a mechanical engineer and commercial helicopter pilot, initiated design work on a design that led to the SH09.Johnson, Oliver. \\"Reaching for the SKYe.\\" Vertical Magazine, 19 October 2016. Frustrated by legacy designs and typically unsuited cockpits, Stucki had observed that the light single-engine helicopter market had not seen any all-new designs in decades, and he conducted market research that indicated a viable demand for a new rotorcraft in the 2.5-tonne class. In 2007 he formed Marenco Swisshelicopter (Marenco - from Martin Engineering and Consulting) to develop the rotorcraft. The SH09 adopted several modern features. Its airframe is entirely composed of carbon composite materials; it employs a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and a high-visibility cockpit. The carbon composite construction allowed a relatively low empty weight. According to Mathias Senes, Marenco's chief commercial officer: \\"There‚Äôs no other material today that brings the benefits of rigidity, strength, and light weight\\". Stucki approached his design from a pilot's perspective, attempting to improve ergonomics, comfort, and operator requirements. It possesses excellent hot and high performance, lengthy flight endurance, a low noise signature, and has relatively smooth handling. By 2009, sufficient financing had been secured from investors, which allowed for the SH09 to be formally launched that year; accordingly, the helicopter was given the designation SKYe SH09 in reference to the year that development on the project officially commenced. A small number of staff worked on the project, initially being a team of nine; an emphasis was made on recruiting very high quality engineers, including from other rotorcraft manufacturers such as Airbus Helicopters; the company had over 100 employees in 2016. Company operations in Switzerland have been split between the towns of Pf√§ffikon, where design work is centered, and Mollis, where assembly and flight testing operations are conducted; a third facility in Germany handles compliance verification. A pre-production prototype of the SH09 was displayed at Heli-Expo 2011 in Orlando, Florida, marking its public introduction. At that time, Marenco stated that it planned to make first deliveries in 2015, and that it would produce as many as 15 SH09s within the first year as well as potentially rising to 30 rotorcraft in the following year. It was also stated that, while the Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine had been selected as the initial powerplant for the SH09, it was hoped that customers would soon be offered a choice in engines. In January 2018 the company was rebranded as Kopter, with the helicopter name changed to SH09 (dropping the SKY-e). =Prototypes= The flight test program will use three prototypes. Prototype P1 first flew on 2 October 2014,\\"Marenco Swisshelicopter SKYe SH09 goes airborne for the first time.\\" Vertical Magazine, 2 October 2014.Dubois, Thierry. \\"Start-up Marenco Flies SKYe Helicopter for First Time\\" AIN Online, 2 October 2014.

P2 and P3 are the main vehicles for airworthiness certification testing; they are more representative of production aircraft, their design incorporating several refinements. The company plans to first certify SH09 with EASA, then rapidly seek certification in the United States. Completion of P1 was reportedly delayed by as much as six months due to the late delivery of its engine by Honeywell.Trimble, Stephen. \\"HELI-EXPO: Engine delivery quickens pace to first flight for Swiss helo.\\" Flight International, 5 March 2013.

At that time the company projected receiving EASA certification within 12-16 months.Perry, Dominic. \\"Marenco upbeat on SKYe SH09's prospects after first flight.\\" Flight International, 7 October 2014. In summer 2015, Marenco halted flight tests after 100 flight hours to focus on producing the second prototype, which incorporated a modified bearingless rotor head and new rotor blades to reduce vibrations.Press Release (German language). Marenco Swisshelicopter, 26 February 2016. By September 2015, it was recognised that the original development timeline had been optimistic.\\"OPINION: Developing Swiss precision.\\" Flight International, 28 September 2015 On 26 February 2016, P2 performed its first flight, piloted by new chief test pilot Richard Trueman. At this point, certification was expected to be achieved near to the end of 2016 or during early 2017.Perry, Dominic. \\"HELI-EXPO: Marenco flies second SKYe SH09 prototype.\\" Flight International, 29 February 2016. In May 2016, it was reported that Marenco were increasing the pace of the flight test program, that P3 was to be completed within that year, and that type certification should occur during 2017. Marenco had 70 Letters of intent in autumn 2015 and 90 in spring 2016, half from North America. In September 2015 the company stated its expectation to produce 40-100 aircraft per year. Also in May 2016 a company representative indicated that Marenco was pursuing the development of a twin-engine version of the design. In late 2016, Stucki stated that some flexibility to allow for the future adaption of the SH09 to become a twin-engine helicopter had already been incorporated into the base design, and indicated that a twin-engine variant was a straightforward progression. In October 2016, Stucki stated that P3 would be completed in early 2017, and that certification would likely to occur within 2018.Perry, Dominic. \\"Marenco nears high-speed tests of SH09.\\" Flight International, 11 October 2016. Development was delayed by having to design and manufacture not only the helicopter itself, but also supporting tools such as test equipment. In January 2018 the company stated its hope that the rotorcraft would enter service in 2019. In February 2018, Kopter was seeking to raise CHF 150 million to carry it through certification to production in the second half of 2019, adding to the CHF 270 million already spent since 2007 by the Russian Mamut foundation. During the 2018 Heli-Expo, Kopter announced 23 firm orders and 11 options worth $119 million from Norwegian Helitrans (12+6), Elling Halvorson for Rainier Heli Lift, Hawaiian Paradise Helicopters and South African Safomar Aviation. Design The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, powered by a single Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the shrouded tail rotor has a wider diameter and a thinner chord in order to increase airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the shrouded tail rotor offer reduced noise. The HTS900 is rated at 1,020-shaft-horsepower, providing improved performance in hot and high conditions. The monocoque fuselage is made from composite materials and is equipped with sliding side doors on either side along with a rear clamshell door; it incorporates a series of floor-mounted windows between the pilots' seats for additional vertical visibility. Some of the composite materials used have been produced using out of autoclave composite manufacturing from suppliers such as TenCate and Gurit. According to Marenco, inspiration for the fuselage's design was drawn from the automotive industry.Croft, John. \\"Marenco launches first Swiss-made helicopter.\\" Flight International, 8 March 2011. It has been stated that the firm has sought to introduce the cabin volume of medium-sized twin-engine helicopters to the single-engine market. The SH09 is offered with various different layout configurations. The standard option provides two pilot seats forward and four passenger seats aft, all adjustable fore/aft and up/down. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom were designed for air ambulance applications. The SKH09 cockpit layout provides a generous field of view. A Sagem-built ICDS-8A glass cockpit suite is an integrated part of the SH09's standard avionics and instrumentation package. The rotorcraft has been designed with a condition- based maintenance policy, specifying that there should be no time between overhaul (TBO) limits on its various components and systems, including the engine; instead, maintenance is performed based upon condition, which is continuously monitored at all times by an onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS). Ease of maintenance and access to systems was an active consideration during the design phase, aiming to deliver lower overall maintenance costs. Operational history It was announced at Heli-Expo 2016 that Swiss operator Air Zermatt would serve as the SH09's launch customer.Perry, Dominic. \\"HELI-EXPO: Air Zermatt signs as launch customer for Marenco SKYe SH09.\\" Flight International, 2 March 2016.

The North Rotunda is located on Tunnel Street in the Finnieston area of Glasgow with the South Rotunda at Plantation Place in Govan. History Designed by Simpson and Wilson, and built between 1890 and 1896 by Glasgow Tunnel Company,http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/whereilive/coast/stages.shtml?stage=4&walk;=strathclyde the Rotunda covered deep shaftshttp://www.clydewaterfrontheritage.com/harbourtunnelandrotundas.aspx to tunnels which enabled vehicular and pedestrian access to the other side of the river. Pedestrians, horses and carts - and later motor vehicles - would be hauled up by hydraulic lifts provided by Otis Elevator Company of New York. During the Second World War, the tunnels were temporarily closed because all the metal from the lifts was removed to contribute to the war effort. The tunnels were an expensive venture to run and were passed to the council to run as a service in 1926. The increased costs of running the tunnels which were prone to damp and the increase of motor cars on the roads lead to the closure of the pedestrian tunnel in 1980, and the vehicular tunnels being filled in 1986. Though the pedestrian tunnel still exists, it is closed to the public. Originally, three-storey red and white brick towers stood alongside the Rotundas, containing the hydraulic accumulators that powered the lifts, but these have been demolished.  Other uses  Over the years, the Rotundas have served many functions including during the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 when one housed a replica of the famous Nardini‚Äôs ice cream parlour in Largs. The site has also served as a science centre, The \\"Dome of Discovery\\", which was funded by Glasgow City Council and BP Exploration to \\"celebrate the scientific and industrial culture of the city\\". In 2014, the National Theatre of Scotland took over the South Rotunda, with \\"The Tin Forest\\" project, creating a pop-up arts venue for performance and visual art as part of Festival 2014, the Commonwealth Games strand of the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Programme.

It was an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Accrington, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn until November 2015 when it was closed. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History A church has been on the site since 642 AD, and the site is traditionally associated with St Oswald. The tower dates from the late medieval period, and the nave was built in 1804‚Äì05. The parapet was added to the tower in 1844. In 1895‚Äì96 the chancel was built, and tracery was installed in the nave windows. The stained glass in the south nave windows was replaced in 1918 following damage caused by an explosion in a nearby ammunition factory. The tower was damaged by fire in 1983. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone with slate roofs. In the body of the church the stone is coursed, but in the tower it is uncoursed and roughly hewn. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, a three-bay chancel, and a west tower. The tower is supported by buttresses, and has a low rectangular west door, above which is a three- light Perpendicular window. There are Perpendicular bell openings on three sides of the tower, and a clock on the fourth side. The parapet is embattled. The nave is in two storeys, with two tiers of windows along the sides. These are round-arched, in Georgian style, and contain tracery from the Victorian period. The chancel windows are arched with tracery. =Interior= Inside the church are galleries on three sides, carried on octagonal cast iron columns with fluting and roundels in the capitals. At the west end is a pair of staircases. The ceiling is flat. The reredos was made by Powell's in 1909, and is made using the opus sectile technique. The font is Perpendicular in style. In the south wall of the nave are two sets of windows with stained glass depicting the Four Evangelists. These were remade by Morris & Co. in 1918 to the original designs of Edward Burne Jones after they were damaged in the 1917 explosion for the cost of ¬£230. On the south side of the chancel are windows of 1927 by B. D. Walmsley. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1865‚Äì67 by John Warner & Sons.

McFarland and Company. . Total records are not known at this time, but McDuffie probably amassed nearly 200 wins along the way in the many baseball circuits in which he played. Besides, McDuffie was a good hitter, swift baserunner and unrivalled self-promoter. But he often got more attention for his handsome looks, flashy dress, gold jewelries, flamboyant behavior and bevy of girlfriends than for his ball playing.The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues A crowd pleaser, he was known for wearing a jacket with the words The Great McDuffie emblazoned on the back in large letters.Porter, David L.

He moved to the consolidated Brooklyn-Newark Eagles late in 1936, playing for them through the 1937 midseason. McDuffie struggled in 1936, while battling stomach ailments that would haunt him in later years as well. He rebounded in 1937, going 10‚Äì4 with a 3.07 ERA, and hurled two victories over Satchel Paige in three matchups. He quickly became a favorite of Effa Manley, who along with his husband Abe Manley was co-owner of the Eagles. She took an active role in the team, serving as manager and scheduler. Sometimes she took too active a role, for instance when she tried to control the antics of McDuffie inside and outside the ballpark. Terris the Terrible, as he was dubbed, amassed a 13‚Äì2 record for Newark in 1938 while completing his 18 starts. But he was also at the centre of a controversy, when the Eagles players and staff hinted at a possible sentimental relation between Mrs. Manfrey and McDuffie.

During the 1945 spring, he auditioned for the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, who made no offer. McDuffie was 34 years old at the time, and well past his prime. At one point after World War II, McDuffie was the highest-paid player in the Eastern division of the Negro with a salary of $6,000 a year. He spent part of 1945 with the Eagles before joining the Mexican Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo late in the season. He later returned to Torre√≥n in 1946 and played for the Aguilas de Veracruz in 1947, during what would be his last season in the Mexican League. Unfortunately, McDuffie suffered serious and debilitating illnesses that affected his performance in the league. In 1945 he missed time due to an appendix operation, while the following year he had a stomach operation to remove an internal growth. He finished with a record of 21‚Äì33 during his unfortunate stay in Mexico.Treto Cisneros, Pedro (2002). The Mexican League/La Liga Mexicana: Comprehensive Player Statistics, 1937‚Äì2001.

While playing for Marianao in 1952‚Äì1953 McDuffie had the misfortune to play for manager Dolf Luque, a former major league pitcher who was notorious for his bad temper and conflicts with other people. During a playoff series, Luque wanted McDuffie to start on two days' rest, but McDuffie refused saying his arm was sore. Once the enraged manager returned to the locker room from his adjacent office waving a loaded pistol and pointed it at the pitcher, McDuffie quickly changed his mind, went out and fired a two-hitter game.SABR Biography Project ‚Äì Dolf Luque article written by Peter C. Bjarkman His most productive season in Cuba came with Cienfuegos in 1944‚Äì1945, when he posted a 7‚Äì6 record and a league's second-best 2.35 ERA in 20 games, while leading in complete games (9), strikeouts (68), walks (43), and innings pitched (138). He compiled a 37‚Äì43 record during his Cuban visits.Figueredo, Jorge S. (2011). Cuban Baseball: A Statistical History, 1878‚Äì1961. Macfarland & Company. . =Puerto Rico League= McDuffie also spent parts of two seasons in the Puerto Rico League, although he did not enjoy much success in the circuit. He played for the Senadores de San Juan in the 1941‚Äì1942 tournament, joining a team that featured Monte Irvin, Luis Olmo and Bill Wright, but it did not prevent the Leones de Ponce from winning the championship. Then an important rule change came in 1944‚Äì1945, when the league allowed three imports per team. Since the start, the Cangrejeros de Santurce counted with Roy Campanella and McDuffie, but that did not stop Ponce from winning a fourth straight pennant, frequently led by perennial batting champion Francisco Coimbre.Van Hyning, Thomas E.

He reported late for his first stint with Magallanes, but responded with a 3‚Äì0 record and a solid 1.86 ERA in four pitching appearances, including three starts and two complete games, helping the team win the pennant. Magallanes was led by outfielder/manager Vidal L√≥pez, who topped the league with nine home runs and 43RBIs, while ending second with a .355 batting average, .32 points shy of teammate Jim Pendleton, en route to the 1950 Caribbean Series.Navegantes del Magallanes (1949‚Äì1950) =Caribbean Series= The Venezuelan club finished with a 1‚Äì5 record in the Series, while McDuffie lost his two starts against Luis Arroyo and the Criollos de Caguas by scores of 2‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2, suggesting a bit of bad luck. In his first start McDuffie was blanking the Puerto Rico team 1‚Äì0 on three hits through eight plus innings, but gave up a two-out, pinch-hit two-run homer to Wilmer Fields in the bottom of the ninth, and Caguas won the contest 2‚Äì1. He lasted seven innings in his second start, giving up three runs on six hits, while Magallanes batted just six singles and left seven runners on base. McDuffie posted a 0‚Äì2 record and a 2.87 ERA in 15‚Öî innings of work, while limiting the opposing batters to a .200 average, and did not return to the Series.Nu√±ez, Jos√© Antero (1994). Serie del Caribe de la Habana a Puerto la Cruz. JAN Editor. . He declined in his second season with Magallanes, going 1‚Äì3 with a 6.86 ERA in seven games (three starts). =Dominican Republic League= Besides, McDuffie pitched in the Dominican Professional Baseball League in 1952. He posted a 14‚Äì3 record in the regular season and went 2‚Äì0 with a save in the playoffs, as the Aguilas Cibae√±as defeated the Tigres del Licey in the maximum of seven games to claim the championship title. McDuffie won the MVP award for his contribution in three of the four victories of his team. He is culturally referenced as the creator of the popular catch phrase La hit no gana juego (Hits do not win games), a reference to the many hits he allowed, but still ended winning the games.Mateo, Andr√©s; Pi√±a C√°mpora, Tony; Yun√©n, Rafael Emilio (2008).

Rule Hamad bin Said was the son of the Imam and Sultan Said bin Ahmad, who succeeded to those positions in 1783 on the death of his father, Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi. Said bin Ahmad was increasingly unpopular. Around the end of 1785 a group of notables elected his brother, Qais bin Ahmad, as Imam. This revolt soon collapsed. In 1786 Hamad bin Said managed to get control of Muscat, with its fortress. One by one the other fortresses in Oman submitted to Hamad. Said no longer had any temporal power. Hamad took the title of Sheikh and established his court in Muscat.

A measurement can be made of the network length of various different modes of transport, including rail, bus, road and air. The measurement may focus on one of a number of specific characteristics, such as route length, line length or track length. Lines and routes Continental European and Scandinavian transport network analysts and planners have long had a professional practice of using the following terminology (in their own languages) to draw a distinction between: *a line ‚Äì namely \\"an operational element of [a] public transport system\\"; and *a route ‚Äì as in \\"the route that [a] bus or rail vehicle follows through the city\\". In 2000, this terminology was adopted by an English language best practice guide to public transport, to minimise the risk of confusion. Since then, a number of other English language specialist publications have adopted the same terminology, for the same reason. The terminology is therefore also used in this article.  Route length  The route length of a transport network is the sum of the lengths of all routes in the network, such as railways, road sections or air sectors. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration has also referred to this as \\"Directional Route Miles (DRM)\\". Where a network is made up of railways, route length has also been defined, by at least one source, as the sum of the distances (in kilometres) between the midpoints of all stations on the network. In a measurement of route length, each route is counted only once, regardless of how many lines pass over it, and regardless of whether it is single track or multi track, single carriageway or dual carriageway. If a transport network is made up of tangible routes owned or operated by the operator of the network (such as railways), then its route length is therefore the total length of the network's revenue earning fixed infrastructure.  Line length  In , a calculation may also be made of network's line length, which is the sum of the lengths of all of the lines in the network. Any route in the network that is shared by multiple lines is therefore counted more than once. As a result, the line length of a transport network is always greater than or equal to its route length.  Track length  If a network is made up of railways, tramways, or a combination of the two, its track length may also be calculated. The track length of a rail network is the combined length of all tracks in the network. Thus, a double track route will have a track length twice as long as its route length.  Calculation example  Map of example network. To illustrate how the three different calculations of network length are performed, here is a simple example: *The tramway (streetcar) network of a small town has two lines. *Maps of the network show line 1 in blue, and line 2 in red. *Both lines begin at point A, and run on a common route long to point B. *At point B, the two lines divide. *Line 1 continues a further 5 km from point B to a terminus at point C. *Line 2 similarly continues a further 5 km from point B, but to a different terminus, at point D. *The entire network is double tracked, apart from a long single non-revenue track from point B to the depot (car barn). The route length is: 5 km (A ‚Üí B) \\\\+ 5 km (B ‚Üí C) \\\\+ 5 km (B ‚Üí D) --- 15 km The line length is: 10 km (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C, line 1) \\\\+ 10 km (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D, line 2) --- 20 km The track length is: 10 km (A ‚Üí B, double track) \\\\+ 10 km (B ‚Üí C, double track) \\\\+ 10 km (B ‚Üí D, double track) \\\\+ 1 km (non-passenger carrying) --- 31 km  See also  *Heuristic routing *Interplanetary Transport Network *Line length ‚Äì about that expression as used in typography *Routing *Transportation network (graph theory)  References  Public transport ","title":"Network length (transport)"},{"id":"41129113","text":"The Battle of Panasowka, which took place on September 3, 1863, near the village of Panasowka (currently Bilgoraj County, Lublin Voivodeship), was one of the largest battles of the January Uprising. A unit of Polish insurgents of some 1,200 defeated here a Russian army detachment. The Poles were supported by some 40 Hungarian volunteers under Count Edward Nyary, who himself was wounded and died. Polish insurgents were divided into two units. One was commanded by Colonel Marcin ‚ÄúLelewel‚Äù Borelowski, and consisted of some 700 - 800 irregulars. Second unit was led by Kajetan ‚ÄúCwiek‚Äù Cieszkowski, and had some 400 irregulars. Facing them was a Russian unit under a Major named Sternberg, which had up to 3,000 soldiers, including dragoons, Cossacks and four cannons. Borelowski placed his soldiers on a Polak hill, and this location is now marked with a commemorative monument with tablets in Polish and Hungarian languages. After an artillery barrage, Russian infantry attacked Polish positions, but the Russians were stopped by Polish cavalry, and their attack collapsed. Some time later, the Poles counterattacked, breaking through Russian lines, and destroying the cannons. One of Polish infantry units was commanded by a Hungarian aristocrat, Major Edward Nyary, who was hit by bullets in a leg, and then in the stomach. Heavily wounded, Nyary died next day in a military hospital. After the battle, Polish units split again into two groups. Borelowski and his men marched towards the village of Batorze, while Cieszkowski headed northwest. A mass grave of those who were killed in the battle is located near Panasowka, along the road to Zwierzyniec. Count Nyary has a separate tomb.

The nonprofit organization primarily focuses on welfare and health care reform at both the state and federal levels. FGA conducts policy research and its experts recommend free- market solutions that promote work, reduce dependency, and increase opportunity. The organization was founded in 2011 by Tarren Bragdon, who now serves as FGA's CEO and president. The group's \\"emphasis on policy messaging and marketing...has differentiated the group from traditional think tanks.\\" History FGA was founded in 2011 by Tarren Bragdon, a former Maine legislator and past CEO of the Maine Heritage Policy Center. According to the organization, FGA was founded with a focus on policy reform in Florida, but adapted to a multi-state focus to implement reforms that reduce government dependency nationwide. FGA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. FGA states that it is primarily funded by individuals, with the remaining funding coming from foundations and businesses. In 2011, the organization's income was $212,000 and in 2012 its funding grew to $731,000. By 2018, the organization's revenue was $9,424,541. FGA has a staff of 26. In 2017, the group had $7 million in revenue. Policy issues =Welfare reform= By studying and tracking the impact of different reforms, the FGA is able to give policy makers clear guidance on what welfare policies have a demonstrable effect on the incomes and independence of people on welfare. The FGA conducted the first and most comprehensive study of the impact of work requirements on able-bodied adults on food stamps in Kansas and Maine and found that incomes more than doubled within a year for those who transitioned out of the program. In all, for every $2,000 people on food stamps lost in benefits, they earned $3,000 in new income. FGA supports work requirements tied to food stamps. The organization piloted welfare changes in several different states before beginning to advocate for changes at a federal level in 2017. FGA supports legislation that would require able-bodied individuals between the ages of 18 and 60 to work or attend training programs for 20 hours each week in order to receive benefits. =Medicaid expansion= Blocking Medicaid expansion has been a longtime project of the FGA, as it sees Medicaid spending under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as unsustainable, threatening both state budgets and the services provided to traditional Medicaid patients. At the state level, Medicaid spending already crowds out funding for other critical services, such as primary and higher education, public safety, and infrastructure. A Harvard study found that the FGA‚Äôs involvement in this Medicaid debate was a key factor in whether or not a state expanded the program. =Stop the Scam= Stop the Scam is a FGA program that partners states with third-party vendors to use the latest technology and databases to protect public programs like Medicare and Medicaid from fraud and abuse. State agencies are limited by federal law to how regularly they can audit their own rolls, and this partnership gives them a legal way to conduct more regular verifications. It also gives states access to far more databases than they are currently using or might have access to. This program was first run in Illinois and since has saved the programs hundreds of millions of dollars, removing 400,000 ineligible beneficiaries in the first two years. =Right to Shop= Right to Shop is an FGA program that provides incentives for patients to shop for lower-cost, higher-value health care services. The FGA combined two successful programs (a Massachusetts price transparency component and New Hampshire's Smart Shopper program) into one comprehensive concept that allows patients to know the average price for their county from their insurer for specific services, and if they receive those services at a lower cost provider, the insurance company splits the savings with them in cash.

Accessed October 16, 2013. http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=193490. Chase Clark and Bethine's uncle, Barzilla Clark, both served as mayor of Idaho Falls and were both elected Governor of Idaho for a two-year term, Chase Clark serving from 1941 to 1943. After losing his 1942 reelection bid, Chase Clark was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her cousin D. Worth Clark represented Idaho in Washington as a member of the U.S. House and later the U.S. Senate. While attending Idaho Falls High School, Clark participated in the debate club and student government. After her father was elected governor during her senior year, the family moved to Boise. While attending Boise High School, Bethine met junior Frank Church and they became close friends. After graduation in 1941, she attended Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) for a year, and was elected freshman class vice president. Frank Church graduated from Boise High in 1942 and enrolled at Stanford University in California; Clark transferred to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, \\"her father's alma mater,\\" and graduated in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology.  Bethine and Frank Church  While Clark was in Ann Arbor and after, she and Church stayed in touch by letters. After a year at Stanford, Church enlisted in the military in 1943, and served as a U.S. Army intelligence officer in China, Burma, and India during World War II.\\" After returning from military service, he returned to Stanford and proposed marriage to Clark; the couple announced their engagement in December 1946. On June 21, 1947, they were married at the Clark family ranch, Robinson Bar Ranch (), located east of Stanley. (The ranch was later owned by singer Carole King.) Frank completed his bachelor's degree in political science at Stanford in 1947 and enrolled at Harvard Law School that September, but was forced to withdraw and transfer to Stanford after being diagnosed with cancer. While he was undergoing cancer treatments, the couple welcomed their first child Frank Forrester IV in 1948 on September 23. At age 32 in 1956, Frank ran for the U.S. Senate and beat first-term incumbent Herman Welker of Payette. The following year the family moved to Washington, D.C. and adopted a son and named him Chase Clark Church. Frank Church served four terms in the Senate but was defeated for reelection in 1980 by Steve Symms. Early in 1984, Church was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and he died on April 8 at age 59. In many ways Bethine Clark was as politically active as her husband, actively participating in his campaigns for the Senate and his 1976 presidential campaign. Throughout his time as senator, Bethine's involvement in her husband's campaigns and active participation in public life earned her the informal title as \\"Idaho's third senator.\\" Coming from a very politically involved and powerful family, Bethine Church was a natural for a career in public service. She has chaired or served as a trustee to many committees and organizations over the years. After Frank‚Äôs death, Bethine continued her work in politics, on the national level as well as the state level. In later life she was known as the \\"matriarch of the Idaho Democratic Party.\\"  Political life  Bethine Church was urged to run for the Senate in 1986. If she had decided to run, she would have been fighting for the same seat which her husband had previously held for 24 years. Church knew she didn't fit into the classic mold for a politician's wife: \\"I have often described my life in Washington as like Cinderella's‚ÄîI was either cleaning the fireplace or going to the ball.\\" Until her death Bethine Church was still involved with many organizations, including: *Chairperson of The Frank Church Institute, Boise State University *President and Founder of The Sawtooth Society *Governing Council member of The Wilderness Society *Honorary Board Member of the Terry Reilly Health Services *Sustaining Member of the Boise Junior League *Member of the Idaho Conservation League Church held many other prestigious titles over her career, including: *Past Honorary Co-Chair, Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, Boise *Past Advisory Board Member, Basque Museum & Cultural Center, Boise *Martin Institute for Peace Studies Advisory Board, Moscow, Idaho *Trustee, Boise State University Foundation *President‚Äôs Advisory Committee, John F.

Arruebarrena played for Cienfuegos in the Cuban National Series from 2008 through 2012, and played for the Cuban national baseball team in international competition, before defecting from Cuba in 2013 to pursue a Major League Baseball career. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2014 before a poor attitude and various violations of team rules led to his banishment to the low minors and eventual release. In 2019, he became the first ex-MLB player to return to the Cuban national baseball system after defecting from the country. He now plays for the Cocodrilos de Matanzas of the Cuban National Series, as well as the Cuban national baseball team. Professional baseball career =Cuban career= Arruebarrena played for the Cienfuegos team in the Cuban National Series from 2008-2012 and was a member of the Cuban national baseball team in the 2011 Pan American Games, 2012 Haarlem Baseball Week, the 2013 World Baseball Classic, and the 2013 World Port Tournament. In September 2013, Arruebarrena tried to defect from Cuba, and was barred from participating in the 53rd Cuban National Series as a result. In November, he successfully defected from Cuba, established residency in Haiti and began working out in the Dominican Republic for Major League scouts. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Arruebarrena batting in 2014 On February 12, 2014, it was reported that Arruebarrena had reached a preliminary agreement on a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. On February 22, 2014, the Dodgers announced that they had signed him to a 5-year contract worth a reported $25 million, with a $7.5 million signing bonus. He was assigned to the AA Chattanooga Lookouts to start his career and was called up to the Dodgers on May 21, 2014. He made his MLB debut as the starting shortstop for the Dodgers on May 23, 2014. He struck out three times in that game. He recorded his first hit the next day, on a single to center field off of David Buchanan of the Philadelphia Phillies. On July 26, 2014, Arruebarrena started a massive brawl between the Albuquerque Isotopes and Reno Aces in an AAA game. The day before, he had spent a long time circling the bases after hitting a 3-run homer, and at his first at-bat, he was nearly hit by a pitch. After he struck out, the opposing catcher \\"brushed him\\" as he threw to third base, Arruebarrena \\"shoved\\" the catcher, and both benches cleared. He was optioned to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes the next day. He played in 68 games in the minors in 2014 between three different levels and hit .259. In 22 games with the Dodgers, he was primarily used as a defensive replacement but also had eight hits in 41 at-bats, for a .195 average. Arruebarrena was designated for assignment on December 31, 2014. He cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to the Dodgers new AAA team, the Oklahoma City Dodgers. He was also invited to attend major league spring training as a non-roster player. Arruebarrena was not assigned to any minor league teams and began 2015 in extended spring training in Arizona. On May 21, 2015, he was suspended indefinitely by the team, without pay, for disciplinary reasons. After he appealed to the commissioner's office, the suspension was reduced to 30 days. He spent the entire season in the minor leagues, first with three games for the Arizona League Dodgers, then 12 for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes before spending 38 games with the Tulsa Drillers. Overall, he hit .299 in 53 games with 3 homers and 15 RBI. Arruebarrena returned to Tulsa to start the 2016 season. In 17 games, he hit only .182. On May 4, 2016, the Dodgers announced that he would be suspended for the rest of the season for \\"repeated failure to comply with the terms of his contract.\\" In the 2017 season, he was not assigned to any minor league rosters until late in the year, and only appeared in eight games for the Arizona League Dodgers, where he hit .519 (14 hits in 27 at-bats). Arruebarrena did not appear in any games for the organization in 2018, and was eventually released in late July. =Return to Cuba= In 2019, it was reported that Arruebarrena had successfully repatriated and would join the Cocodrilos de Matanzas of the Cuban National Series. He thus became the first Cuban ex-MLB player to return to the Cuban national baseball system. With Matanzas' victory in the 2019/20 CNS, he also became the first ex-MLB player to win a domestic Series title after repatriating.

The signal mode is propagated toward a region of space, and it is either lost or reflected, depending on whether a target is absent or present, respectively. In principle, quantum illumination can be beneficial even if the original entanglement is completely destroyed by a lossy and noisy environment.  Introduction  Many quantum information applications, such as quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, and superdense coding, rely on entanglement. However, entanglement is a fragile quantum property between particles and can be easily destroyed by loss and noise arising from interaction with the environment, leading to quantum decoherence. Entanglement is therefore considered very hard to use in lossy and noisy environment. Lloyd, Shapiro and collaborators showed that even though entanglement itself may not survive, the residual correlation between the two initially entangled systems remains much higher than any initial classical states can provide. This implies that the use of entanglement should not be dismissed in entanglement-breaking scenarios. Quantum illumination takes advantage of this stronger-than-classical residual correlations between two systems to achieve a performance enhancement over all schemes based on transmitting classical states with comparable power levels. Quantum illumination is particularly useful in extremely lossy and noisy situations.  History  = Theory = The concept of quantum illumination was first introduced by Seth Lloyd and collaborators at MIT in 2008. A theoretical proposal for quantum illumination using Gaussian states was proposed by Jeffrey Shapiro and collaborators. The basic setup of quantum illumination is target detection. Here the sender prepares two entangled systems, called signal and idler. The idler is retained while the signal is sent to probe the presence of a low-reflectivity object in a region with bright background noise. The reflection from the object is then combined with the retained idler system in a joint quantum measurement providing two possible outcomes: object present or object absent. More precisely, the probing process is repeated many times so that many pairs of signal-idler systems are collected at the receiver for the joint quantum detection. The advantage of the scheme is evident at low energies where the mean number of photons in each signal system is very low (of the order of one photon or less). In this case, at fixed low energy, the probability of success in detecting a target has a remarkable improvement with respect to classical detection schemes, where entanglement is not used and signal systems are prepared in coherent states (technically, there is a 6dB improvement in the error exponent ). A key feature of quantum illumination is that the entanglement between the idler system and the reflected signal system is completely lost in the process. However, the residual quantum correlations between these two systems (idler-reflected signal) remain so strong that they could only be created by the presence of entanglement in the initial systems (idler-signal). Because the reflected signal is quantum-correlated with the retained idler system, it can be distinguished among all the uncorrelated background thermal photons that are also received by the detector. Because of this quantum labeling of the systems, the detection of quantum illumination is very efficient. In 2015, an international collaboration coordinated by Stefano Pirandola Quantum Mechanics Could Improve Radar, Physics 8, 18 (2015)() extended the protocol of quantum illumination to the microwave frequencies, thus providing the first theoretical prototype of quantum radar. The original proposal from was analyzed in the Bayesian setting of hypothesis testing, in which prior probabilities are assigned to the hypotheses that the target is absent or present. In 2017, a research paper analyzed quantum illumination in the Neyman-Pearson or asymmetric setting of hypothesis testing, which is a setting of interest in quantum radar applications. It was found that the performance gains of quantum illumination are even greater than those from . In 2017, an optimum receiver design was proposed by Quntao Zhuang, Zheshen Zhang, and Jeffrey Shapiro. Quantum illumination has also been extended to the scenario of target fading.  Related work on secure communication  In 2009, a secure communication scheme based on quantum illumination was proposed. This scheme is a variant of the quantum cryptographic protocols based on continuous variables and two-way quantum communication introduced by Stefano Pirandola, Seth Lloyd and collaborators in 2008. = Experiment = In 2013, Lopaeva et al. exploited photon number correlations, instead of entanglement, in a sub-optimal target detection experiment. To illustrate the benefit of quantum entanglement, in 2013 Zhang et al. reported a secure communication experiment based on quantum illumination and demonstrated for the first time that entanglement can enable a substantial performance advantage in the presence of quantum decoherence. In 2015, Zhang et al. applied quantum illumination in sensing and showed that employing entanglement can yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the optimal classical scheme can provide, even though the highly lossy and noisy environment completely destroys the initial entanglement.Quantum sensor's advantages survive entanglement breakdown, MIT News, 9 March (2015), () This sensing experiment thus proved the original theoretical proposals of quantum illumination. The first experimental effort to perform microwave quantum illumination was based on using Josephson parametric amplifier and a digital receiver. In 2019, Defienne et al. reported the first full-field imaging system based on quantum illumination that uses spatially-entangled photon pairs for imaging through noise .  Applications  Potential applications of quantum illumination include target detection in high background noise environments, but also ultra-sensitive biological imaging and sensing, and secure communication.  Media reporting  Several news articles on quantum illumination have appeared in popular science media, with the goal of elucidating the concept of quantum illumination in less technical terms.

Early years Sultan bin Ahmad was the son of the Imam and Sultan Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi. Early in 1781 he and his brother Saif took control of the forts of al-Mirani and al- Jalali that guarded the harbor of Muscat. When the governor of Muscat tried to recover the forts, Sultan and Saif began a damaging bombardment of the town. The two brothers gained the support of the powerful Sheikh Sarkar, who marched on the capital in April 1781. Their father agreed to an amnesty, letting his rebellious sons hold both the forts. He changed his mind and took al Mirani, while the brothers held al Jelali for some months. Sultan and Saif then kidnapped their brother Said bin Ahmad. The Imam, their father, hurried to Muscat which he reached in January 1782. He ordered the commander of Mirani to fire on Jelali, and his ships joined in from the east of the fort. While this was happening, Said bin Ahmad bribed his jailer and escaped. Isolated and without a hostage, the two brothers agreed to surrender. The Imam took Saif and held him under surveillance to prevent a fresh rebellion. On his father's death in 1783 Said bin Ahmad was elected Imam and took possession of the capital, Rustaq. Sultan and Saif called on Sheikh Sakar of the Shemal tribal group to help them gain the throne. The Sheikh took the towns of Al Jazirah Al Hamra, Sharjah, Rams and Khor Fakkan (all in today's UAE). Said fought back, but was unable to regain these towns. However, the brothers felt it was safer to leave the country. Saif sailed for East Africa, intending to set himself up as a ruler there. He died there soon after. Sultan sailed to Gwadar on the Makran coast of Balochistan. The ruler of that state granted him protection and gave him Gwadar. Said bin Ahmad became increasingly unpopular. Around the end of 1785 a group of notables elected his brother, Qais bin Ahmad, as Imam. This revolt soon collapsed. In 1786 Said's son Hamad bin Said managed to get control of Muscat, with its fortress. One by one the other fortresses in Oman submitted to Hamad. Said no longer had any temporal power. Hamad took the title of Sheikh and established his court in Muscat. Said bin Ahmad remained in Rustaq and retained the title of Imam, but this was purely a symbolic religious title that carried no power. Hamad died in 1792. Reign Sultan bin Ahmad, who had returned to Oman from Balochistan, took control in Muscat. To avoid family disputes, at a meeting in Barka he confirmed his brother Said as Imam in Rustaq, and he ceded control of Sohar to his brother Qais bin Ahmad. In 1798 Sultan made a treaty with the British East India Company. In 1800, Oman suffered from an invasion by Wahhabis from the north, who occupied the Buraimi oasis and besieged Sultan's brother Qais in Sohar. Sultan died in 1804 on an expedition to Basra. He appointed Mohammed bin Nasir bin Mohammed al-Jabry as the Regent and guardian of his two sons, Salim bin Sultan and Said bin Sultan.

He batted and threw right handed. (Spanish) L√≥pez starred as a starting pitcher and slugging outfielder in his homeland between the 1930s and 1950s. A long time member of the Navegantes del Magallanes in Venezuelan tournaments, his effort earned him a place in franchise lore. In addition, L√≥pez played in the professional leagues of Cuba, M√©xico and Puerto Rico, overcoming color line prejudice throughout a career that lasted 21 years. He was well known for his solid batting, his long home runs and dominant pitching, while his popular nickname, El Muchachote de Barlovento (The Big Boy of Barlovento), was a testimony to his naive face and burly frame. L√≥pez is still considered one of the most versatile Venezuelan ballplayers ever produced.Bjarkman, Peter (2005). Diamonds around the Globe: The Encyclopedia of International Baseball. Greenwood Publishing Group. Early life L√≥pez was born in R√≠o Chico, a small farming community located in the Barlovento coastal area of Miranda state in Venezuela. He was a six- year-old boy when his father died in 1924. Three years later, his mother decided to move to Caracas in search of better economic livelihood. As a result, he had to work from an early age to help cover household expenses, working as an errand or courier, as well as serving as an altar boy to earn money for shoes and clothes. He had no formal education but taught himself to write through reading. When he was nine, he especially liked watching his friends and relatives play baseball on a sandlot team that played Saturday afternoons. A friend taught him to throw a baseball, and they played catch almost every day, which turned out to be the key to his future. After a long while, L√≥pez finally attended elementary school, but had to quit in order to take a formal job to help his impoverished mother and blind sister. A school official interceded, and with the help of a local merchant, they brokered a deal in which the young Vidal would go to school, but at same time have a job that would keep the family afloat. Only then was he given the chance to blossom into a gifted athlete, one who loved baseball more than anything imaginable. Professional career =Early years (1935‚Äì1940)= In 1935, at age 17, L√≥pez debuted professionally with the Royal Criollos BBC of the newly created Liga Nacional de B√©isbol, which had stabilized the first national championship of first division in Venezuela since its inauguration in 1930.Guti√©rrez, Daniel; Alvarez, Efraim; Guti√©rrez (h), Daniel (2006). La Enciclopedia del B√©isbol en Venezuela. LVBP, Caracas. The circuit included other three teams, which resulted in a revised weekend schedule of 24 games in which each team played its three opponents four times apiece. L√≥pez emerged as a dominant shutdown starter in his debut, pitching in seven of the 12 games of his team and going 5‚Äì0 with 28 strikeouts and a minuscule 0.65 earned run average in 55 innings, guiding his team to the championship pennant.La Enciclopedia del B√©isbol en Venezuela L√≥pez was used sparingly in his second year, but enjoyed a superb all-around season with the Sabios de Vargas in 1937, as he topped the league in home runs (4) and RBIs (12), while posting a .312 batting average with a 2-1 pitching record and a 2.77 ERA in three pitching appearances. In addition, he etched his name in the records books by setting two marks in Venezuelan baseball history. On August 22, he smashed a grand slam off Centauros' pitcher Oscar Estrada, which became the first grand slam ever hit in a Venezuelan ballpark. Then, on September 26 he also became the first player ever to hit two home runs in a single game. By then, the appearance of professional baseball in Venezuela attracted many ball players from the Caribbean and the United States to the country, showing a more integrated sport there than it was in the United States. This is evidenced in the hiring of stellar pitchers like Ram√≥n Braga√±a, Mart√≠n Dihigo, Bertrum Hunter, Satchel Paige, Roy Welmaker and the aforementioned Estrada among others, to whom the teenage L√≥pez had to face more than one once, either as a hitter or pitcher. L√≥pez returned after a one-year absence and was impressive on the mound for the repeating champion Vargas in 1939, going 5-1 with a league-best ERA of 1.71 and 30 strikeouts, allowing 12 earned runs on 47 hits and 12 walks in 63.0 innings. He also contributed as a two-way player, batting a .274 average, two homers and six RBIs in 23 games. Traded to the Cardenales BBC in 1940, he tied with Centauros' Josh Gibson for the most home runs (4) and finished second in RBIs (11) behind teammate Chucho Ramos (14). He also made 14 pitching appearances, going 3-6 with a 3.44 ERA and 55 strikeours in 110 innings. =Cuba League (1940‚Äì1941)= After the regular season, L√≥pez signed a contract to play with the Elefantes de Cienfuegos in the 1940‚Äì1941 Cuban League tournament. He quickly became the best pitcher of the league, topping all pitchers with 12 victories and 16 complete games,Cuban League ‚Äì 1940‚Äì1941 Season Leaders playing in a highly competitive league that boasted such pitching stars as Mart√≠n Dihigo, Agapito Mayor, Gilberto Torres, Tom√°s de la Cruz and Luis Tiant, Sr., as well as noted hitters as L√°zaro Salazar, Ray Dandridge, Sam Bankhead, Roberto Estalella, Alejandro Crespo and Santos Amaro. That season, L√≥pez also was involved in the fastest game played in Cuban baseball history, as he won a complete-game pitching duel against Ren√© Monteagudo and the Leopardos de Santa Clara by a score of 2‚Äì1, which lasted one hour and nine minutes.Figueredo, Jorge S. (2011). Cuban Baseball: A Statistical History, 1878‚Äì1961. Macfarland & Company. Eventually, L√≥pez played in the outfield corners during his lone season in Cuba, but was also notable as he made the All-Star team and was just the second Venezuelan to play in the Cuban league after fellow pitcher Alejandro Carrasquel, an MVP Award winner in the 1938‚Äì1939 season.Cuban League ‚Äì 1938‚Äì1939 Season Leaders =First Triple Crown= The first and most important event in Venezuelan baseball history was the 1941 victory of the national selection over the Cuban squad in the Baseball World Cup tournament held in Havana. It served to consolidate baseball as the deporte rey ‚Äìthe dominant sport‚Äì in Venezuela in the years to come. Even though L√≥pez did not participate in the 1941 event, he had time to join the Venezuelan league after returning from Cuba. He was unquestionably the dominant pitcher in the circuit, fashioning a ledger of 9-4 with 55 strikeouts and a 0.67 ERA to win the pitching Triple Crown, while handling a 121-inning work in his first full season for Magallanes, allowing also only nine earned runs on 67 hits and 22 walks. As an ace pitcher and cleanup hitter, he also hurled two no-hitters, led in innings pitched, and smashed the only home run of the tournament. Although this was a wasted effort, because of the fact of his team lost the final and decisive game to the eventual champions Patriotas de Venezuela. =Puerto Rico League (1941‚Äì1942)= Short before the Venezuelan tournament ended, L√≥pez arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico to play with the Cangrejeros de Santurce one day before the 1941‚Äì1942 Puerto Rican season began.Van Hyning, Thomas E. (2008). The Santurce Crabbers: Sixty Seasons of Puerto Rican Winter League Baseball. McFarland & Company. L√≥pez had some pretty memorable moments while playing in Puerto Rico. In his debut, he struck out 11 Tiburones de Aguadilla batters, including the side in the fifth inning, but lost the game. He rebounded in his next start, pitching a shutout against the Leones de Ponce and also homering in that win. Then, L√≥pez faced Negro league star Terris McDuffie and the Senadores de San Juan in game one of a crucial series. During the game, Cangrejeros fans roared when L√≥pez struck out Monte Irvin with the bases loaded and forced McDuffie to hit into an eight inning double play to preserve a 2‚Äì1 lead. Previously, L√≥pez had driven in both Santurce runs with a single. He was carried off the field by the Santurce fans after the victory, while the Cangrejeros swept the two games of the series.The Santurce Crabbers Nevertheless, Santurce lost several close games, being unable to match Ponce, the team that won both halves of the season led by slugger Francisco Coimbre. L√≥pez was selected for the league All-Star games played on January 1, 1942. It had been three seasons since the league's first All-Star game took effect in 1938‚Äì1939. Besides L√≥pez, both contests featured notable players as Barney, Raymond and Willard Brown (non-relatives), as well as Bill Byrd, Roy Campanella, Buster Clarkson, Ray Dandridge, Leon Day, Josh Gibson, Luis Olmo, Quincy Trouppe, Willie Wells, and Coimbre and Irvin, among others. =Second Triple Crown= After his stint in Puerto Rico, L√≥pez joined the Cervecer√≠a Caracas club during the 1942‚Äì1943 season, as the Venezuelan league shifted players as needed to help new teams stay afloat. During what turned out to be another productive season for L√≥pez, he claimed his second and consecutive pitching Triple Crown in Venezuelan baseball. He posted a 6‚Äì1 record with a 1.14 ERA and 26 strikeouts in his eight starts and also led in complete games (6), while scattering eight earned runs on 11 hits and 10 walks over 63‚Öì innings of work. To complement his fine performance, he contributed with a .313 average, drove in 20 runs, and posted a solid .417 of slugging in 12 games. L√≥pez went 3-3 with a 1.83 ERA and 25 strikeouts in 1943‚Äì1944, completing six of his eight pitching appearances for Magallanes. He also hit .375 with one home run and 12 RBIs in 18 games, while leading the league in doubles (6). =Mexico League (1943‚Äì1945)= L√≥pez continued his winning ways in the Mexican League from 1943 through 1945.Treto Cisneros, Pedro (2002). The Mexican League/La Liga Mexicana: Comprehensive Player Statistics, 1937‚Äì2001. McFarland & Company. There were just too many good ballplayers, and not only from Mexico. The homegrown Mexican players included former Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators infielder Chile G√≥mez, as well as future American League champion bat Bobby √Åvila, to name a few.Lanctot, Neil (2012). Campy: The Two Lives of Roy Campanella. Simon & Schuster. All Mexican league teams were also strengthened by an abundance of Cuban talent such as former Senators catcher Mike Guerra, who played and managed, while the versatile Mart√≠n Dihigo managed, pitched and excelled at second base. Ultimately, L√≥pez improved at least from the perspective of his long term development as a two- way player, so he joined the league with the Industriales de Monterrey, where he formed a battery with future Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella.The Mexican League L√≥pez resulted victorious in his Mexican debut, compiling a 16-12 record with a 2.08 ERA and also hitting a .304 average in 78 games as an outfielder, while leading all pitchers in ERA and tying for fifth for the most wins. In 1944, he again was a two-way star for Monterrey, batting a .280 average with 11 home runs and 60 RBI in 85 games, ranking also second with 23 stolen bases and tying for third in homers. As a pitcher, he fashioned a mark of 13-14 with a decent 3.70 ERA. At the time, L√≥pez was enjoying the best moment of his career, but then things began to change. Between Venezuela, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, L√≥pez had worked close to 1,000 innings in his previous four years, a considerable amount of usage for anyone, but especially for a pitcher who was then only in his early twenties. As a result, L√≥pez was suffering from arm fatigue and a sore elbow in 1945, ending with a 0-1 record and a 9.00 ERA in only seven innings of work for Monterrey. Additionally, his offensive production declined as the season progressed, while batting .270 in limited action as an outfielder. =Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (1946‚Äì1955)= Briefly after returning from Mexico, L√≥pez was kept under wraps due to his fears concerning his pitching arm. Unfortunately, the acute effects of overload pitching and nagging injuries rendered him ineffective with Magallanes in the 1945 season, losing his only start in which he gave up just two runs on 10 hits through seven innings, while striking out two batters and walking one. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a successful season as an outfielder, winning the batting crown with an average of .464 in 16 games, driving in 13 runs and scoring 14 times in 16 games, while also leading the league in hits (26), doubles (9), and slugging percentage (.714). When the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League started to operate in 1946, L√≥pez stayed with Magallanes for the rest oh his career and also managed the team in part of that season. He batted a paltry .216 average and three homers in 28 games, while his 23 RBIs ranked him fourth in the new circuit despite missing significant playing time due to recurrent injuries. He also realized that his pitching arm was gone, and though he might come back for a couple of games, he could never again pitch effectively at all, giving up three earned runs on four hits and five walks, while striking one in his final three innings of work. L√≥pez became the first player to pinch-hit a home run in VPBL history in that season, when he belted his blast off Vargas' ace pitcher Roy Welmaker. L√≥pez rebounded sharply during the 1947‚Äì1948 season, winning the batting title with a .374 average, driving in 29 RBIs and collecting a .532 of slugging in 39 games, while again managing Magallanes for a brief stint. He also led the VPBL in hits (52), had six RBIs less than leader Dalmiro Finol (Cerveceria), tied for fourth in home runs (4), and finished fourth in slugging, being surpassed only by Luke Easter (Patriotas), Henry McHenry (Magallanes) and Roy Campanella (Vargas). In 1948‚Äì1949, L√≥pez served as an outfielder and part-time manager with Magallanes for a third season in a row. He topped the league with 29 RBIs and batted a second-best .372 average, losing the batting race to Caracas' shortstop Chico Carrasquel by a narrow margin (.37288 to .37209). He then reinforced the Cervecer√≠a Caracas champion team in the First Caribbean Series to be played in 1949, going 1-for-2 in a pitch-hitting role.Nu√±ez, Jos√© Antero (1994). Serie del Caribe de la Habana a Puerto La Cruz. JAN Editor. L√≥pez posted another strong offensive performance in 1949‚Äì1950, when he batted .355 and led the league with nine home runs and 43 RBIs in 49 games. He also led the hitters with a slugging of .645, .009 points ahead teammate Jim Pendleton, and finished second in batting average, .32 points shy of Pendleton. This time, L√≥pez managed Magallanes to the pennant and advanced to the 1950 Caribbean Series. The team finished last with a 1‚Äì5 record, while L√≥pez went 4-for-15 and paced the offense with a team-high four RBIs, leading also the Series in doubles (4) and tying for fourth in RBIs.Serie del Caribe In 1950‚Äì1951 L√≥pez hit .359 with five homers and 36 RBIs in 35 games, helping Magallanes win a second consecutive pennant and a ticket to the 1951 Caribbean Series. He went 3-for-6, including a double and one RBI as a backup outfielder and pinch-hitter, in what would be his final Series appearance. In later years L√≥pez suffered problems with his weight and old injuries, which disminished his effectiveness on the field. Nevertheless, he mastered the art of pinch- hitting and eventually played decent defense in the outfield corners. He declined in the 1951‚Äì1952 season, lowering his average to .240, while batting two home runs with 19 RBIs in 41 games. Used exclusively as a pinch hitter in the next two seasons, he went 2-for-19 with a double, retiring after the 1954‚Äì1955 tournament.

Everyman's ballplayer, he worked to overcome the challenges he faced in life and baseball. Although he had no opportunity to play at Major League Baseball, he simply took the best he could find and took advantage of it. He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, but the Big Boy of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.

American psychologist James J. Gibson posited the existence of the ambient optic array as a central part of his ecological approach to optics. For Gibson, perception is a bottom-up process, whereby the agent accesses information about the environment directly from invariant structures in the ambient optic array, rather than recovering it by means of complex cognitive processes. More controversially, Gibson claimed that agents can also directly pick-up the various affordances of the environment, or opportunities for the observer to act in the environment, from the ambient optic array.No√´, A. (2004). 3.9 Gibson, Affordences and the Ambient Optic Array. Action In Perception (pp. 103-106). Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. The optic array as reflected angles of light Gibson stressed that the environment is not composed of geometrical solids on a plane, as in a painting, but is instead best understood as objects nested within one another and organized hierarchically by size. The ambient optic array, therefore, is also organized hierarchically by size, though the components are the solid angles from the object to the point of observation. Large solid angles come from the facades of various objects and interspaces between objects in the environment. Smaller solid angles are nested within the larger angles, and detail the facets and finer properties of the object. As the observer explores the environment, her relation to these angles change, and accordingly the appearance of the environment changes. For example, objects appear to grow larger or smaller depending on whether the observer moves towards or away from the object. This is because the angle subtended by the object to the observer becomes bigger as the observer gets closer, and smaller as the observer recedes. However the objective size of the actual object in the environment never changes.Gibson, J. J. (1986). The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception. Hillsdale (N.J.): Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Put simply by philosopher Alva No√´, the ambient optic array is \\"how things look from here in these conditions.\\" Invariants and direct perception  Gibson was interested in the structures of the ambient optic array that are invariant, or structures that remain static regardless of the actions of the observer. For example, Gibson noted that the upper hemisphere of the array (the sky) tends to be much less structured and brighter than the lower hemisphere (the cluttered earth). No matter what the observer does, the light will always be structured in this way.Reed, E. (1996). 4. Encountering the World: Toward An Ecological Psychology (pp. 48-49). New York: Oxford University Press. He also noticed that \\"optical flow patterns\\", or optical flow invariants, are produced in the array as the agent moves about the environment. The above example of objects \\"growing\\" or \\"shrinking\\" as an observer moves towards or away from them is an example of an optical flow invariant, as the array will always transform like this under those conditions. Gibson hypothesized that agents evolved to directly access relevant information about themselves and the environment from the invariant structures in the array, without the need for high level cognitive computations.Braisby, N., & Cellatly, A. (2012). 3.3 Flow in the ambient optic array. Cognitive Psychology (2nd ed., pp. 78-79). Oxford: Oxford University Press. In other words, in the aforementioned case of objects appearing to grow or shrink, no cognitive processes mediate the observer sensing the apparent growth in size of the object and the observer perceiving that she has now moved toward the object (or the object has moved toward her). These invariant properties are linked with Gibson's idea of affordances. According to Gibson, an affordance is a property of the environment, much like color and size are. For an animal with the appropriate physiological equipment, a tree affords the ability to climb up it, or the ground the ability to walk upon it. Therefore, he claimed, affordances are also specified in the ambient optic array. This means that not only can an agent directly perceive that there is a horizontal surface or that a tree is a tree, but that a horizontal surface is \\"walk-on-able\\" or that a tree is \\"climb-up-able\\". In fact, the agent's perceptual system is so attuned to the invariant information, Gibson argues, that the agent need not consult any of its prior experiences in order to interact with the environment. This implies that agents pick-up meaning and value directly from the environment, rather than project it onto the world.  Criticism  Many critics have rejected at least some of Gibson's claims. Psychologist Richard Gregory asserted that Gibson's bottom-up approach to perception is incomplete. He argued that visual illusions like the Necker cube are the result of the brain's indecision between two equally plausible hypotheses about the cube's orientation. The cube appears to \\"flip\\" between these two orientations even though the sensory information remains static. Therefore, Gregory reasoned that top-down processes must mediate perception. In response, Gibson argued that illusions like the Necker cube are the result of artifice and would not be encountered by agents in realistic perceptual situations, and therefore are irrelevant. However, the waterfall illusion is an example of a naturally occurring illusion and cannot be accounted for by Gibson's theory.Visual Perception Theory Nevertheless, these two approaches can be reconciled. For example, Ulric Neisser developed the perceptual cycle, which involves top-down and bottom-up perceptual processes interacting and informing each other. The processes are causally linked, but of equal importance. Furthermore, David Marr claimed that Gibson had profoundly underestimated the intricacy of visual information processing. While useful information may exist directly in the ambient optic array, Gibson does not elaborate on the mechanisms of the direct pick-up of this information. Marr argues that this is a complex information processing problem, and not as simple as Gibson makes it out to be.No√´, A., & Thompson, E. (2002). 11: Selections from Vision.

In the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of Fulgencio Batista (Cuba's first mixed-race ruler), forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976. He was also the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most senior position in the Communist state from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, Ra√∫l Castro, but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011. Fidel Castro's government was officially atheist from 1962 until 1992. Castro's staunch belief in a communist ideology and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the Cold War struggle between the United States and its allies versus the Soviet Union and its allies. Castro's desire to take the offensive against capitalism and spread communist revolution ultimately led to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias ‚Äì FAR) fighting in Africa. His aim was to create many Vietnams, reasoning that American troops bogged down throughout the world could not fight any single insurgency effectively. An estimated 7,000‚Äì11,000 Cubans died in conflicts in Africa. Castro died of natural causes in late 2016 in Havana. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.  1959‚Äì1976 =Consolidating leadership: 1959= Castro is seen in Washington, D.C., arriving at the MATS Terminal, in April 1959. On February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba, and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.; . Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a public relations firm for a charm offensive, and presented himself as a \\"man of the people\\". U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower avoided meeting Castro; he was instead met by Vice President Richard Nixon, a man Castro instantly disliked.; ; . Proceeding to Canada, Trinidad, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, Castro attended an economic conference in Buenos Aires. He unsuccessfully proposed a $30 billion U.S.-funded \\"Marshall Plan\\" for the whole region of Latin America.; ; . After appointing himself president of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria - INRA), on 17 May 1959, Castro signed into law the First Agrarian Reform, limiting landholdings to per owner. He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture. Though popular among the working class, it alienated many middle-class supporters.; ; , . Castro appointed himself president of the National Tourist Industry as well. He introduced unsuccessful measures to encourage African-American tourists to visit, advertising it as a tropical paradise free of racial discrimination.. Changes to state wages were implemented; judges and politicians had their pay reduced while low-level civil servants saw theirs raised.. In March 1959, Castro ordered rents for those who paid less than $100 a month halved, with measures implemented to increase the Cuban people's purchasing powers. Productivity decreased, and the country's financial reserves were drained within only two years.. Although he refused to initially categorize his regime as 'socialist' and repeatedly denied specifically being a 'communist', Castro appointed advocates of Marxism-Leninism to senior government and military positions. Most notably, Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries. Appalled, Air Force commander Pedro Luis D√≠az Lanz defected to the U.S.; ; . Although President Urrutia denounced the defection, he publicly expressed concern with the rising influence of Marxism. Angered, Castro announced his resignation as prime minister, blaming Urrutia for complicating government with his \\"fevered anti-Communism\\". Over 500,000 Castro-supporters surrounded the Presidential Palace demanding Urrutia's resignation, which was duly received. On July 23, Castro resumed his Premiership and appointed the Marxist Osvaldo Dortic√≥s as the new president.; ; . Castro used radio and television to develop a \\"dialogue with the people\\", posing questions and making provocative statements.. His regime remained popular with workers, peasants and students, who constituted the majority of the country's population,; . while opposition came primarily from the middle class. Thousands of doctors, engineers and other professionals emigrated to Florida in the U.S., causing an economic brain drain.; . Castro's government cracked down on opponents of his government, and arrested hundreds of counter- revolutionaries.; . Castro's government was characterized by the use of psychological torture, subjecting prisoners to solitary confinement, rough treatment, and threatening behavior.. Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by exiles, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Rafael Trujillo's Dominican government, undertook armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in Cuba's mountainous regions. This led to a six-year Escambray Rebellion that lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the revolution. The government won with superior numbers and executed those who surrendered.; ; . After conservative editors and journalists expressed hostility towards the government, the pro- Castro printers' trade union disrupted editorial staff. In January 1960, the government proclaimed that each newspaper would be obliged to publish a \\"clarification\\" written by the printers' union at the end of any articles critical of the government; thus began press censorship in Castro's Cuba.; . =Soviet support and U.S. opposition: 1960= Castro (far left), Che Guevara (center), and other leading revolutionaries, marching through the streets in protest at the La Coubre explosion, 5 March 1960. By 1960, the Cold War raged between two superpowers: the United States, a capitalist liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist-Leninist socialist state ruled by the Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist- Leninist states.; . Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 million loan.; ; . Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries - then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell, Esso and Standard Oil - to process Soviet oil, but under pressure from the U.S. government, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. In retaliation, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.; ; . Relations between Cuba and the U.S. were further strained following the explosion of a French vessel, the Le Coubre, in Havana harbor in March 1960. The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, the cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government were guilty of sabotage. He ended this speech with \\"¬°Patria o Muerte!\\" (\\"Fatherland or Death\\"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years.; ; . Inspired by their earlier success with the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat, on 17 March 1960, U.S. President Eisenhower secretly authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to overthrow Castro's government. He provided them with a budget of $13 million and permitted them to ally with the Mafia, who were aggrieved that Castro's government closed down their businesses in Cuba.; ; . On 13 October 1960, the U.S. prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba, initiating an economic embargo. In retaliation, INRA took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 U.S. companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized.; ; . On 16 December, the U.S. ended its import quota of Cuban sugar, the country's primary export.. Castro at the United Nations General Assembly in 1960. In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the General Assembly of the United Nations. Offended by the attitude of the elite Shelburne Hotel, he and his entourage stayed at the cheap, run-down Hotel Theresa in the impoverished area of Harlem. There he met with journalists and anti-establishment figures like Malcolm X. He also met the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the two leaders publicly highlighted the poverty faced by U.S. citizens in areas like Harlem; Castro described New York as a \\"city of persecution\\" against black and poor Americans. Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches at the General Assembly. Although Castro publicly denied being a socialist, Khrushchev informed his entourage that the Cuban would become \\"a beacon of Socialism in Latin America.\\"; ; . Subsequently, visited by four other socialists, Polish First Secretary W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, Bulgarian chairman Todor Zhivkov, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru,; . the Fair Play for Cuba Committee organized an evening's reception for Castro, attended by Allen Ginsberg, Langston Hughes, C. Wright Mills and I. F. Stone.. Castro returned to Cuba on 28 September. He feared a U.S.-backed coup and in 1959 spent $120 million on Soviet, French and Belgian weaponry. Intent on constructing the largest army in Latin America, by early 1960 the government had doubled the size of the Cuban armed forces.; . Fearing counter- revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, and trained at least 50,000 supporters in combat techniques.; . In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to weed out \\"counter- revolutionary\\" activities and could support the army in the case of invasion. They also organized health and education campaigns, and were a conduit for public complaints. Eventually, 80% of Cuba's population would be involved in the CDR.; ; . Castro proclaimed the new administration a direct democracy, in which the Cuban populace could assemble en masse at demonstrations and express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio- economic elites.Quirk 1993. p. 313. In contrast, critics condemned the new regime as un-democratic. The U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of communist rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties and the absence of freedom of speech and press.. Castro's government emphasised social projects to improve Cuba's standard of living, often to the detriment of economic development.. Major emphasis was placed on education, and under the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity.; . Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island, offering free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third aspect of the social programs was the construction of infrastructure; within the first six months of Castro's government, 600 miles of road had been built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation schemes. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in a measure to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly. =The Bay of Pigs Invasion and embracing socialism: 1961-62= In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy to reduce its 300 staff, suspecting many to be spies. The U.S. responded by ending diplomatic relations, and increasing CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships trading with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills.; ; . Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On 15 April, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed three Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation.; ; . Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries,; . publicly proclaiming that \\"What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses\\". This was his first announcement that the government was socialist.; ; . The CIA and Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. At night, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez to launch the counter-offensive, before taking personal control himself. After bombing the invader's ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade's surrender on 20 April.; ; . He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over questioning on 25 April. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million.; ; . Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained in the run-up to the invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many left Cuba for the United States and established themselves in Florida.. Che Guevara (left) and Castro, photographed by Alberto Korda in 1961. Consolidating \\"Socialist Cuba\\", Castro united the MR-26-7, Popular Socialist Party and Revolutionary Directorate into a governing party based on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism: the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas - ORI), renamed the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) in 1962.; ; . Although the USSR was hesitant regarding Castro's embrace of socialism,. relations with the Soviets deepened. Castro sent Fidelito for a Moscow schooling and while the first Soviet technicians arrived in June, . Castro was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.. In December 1961, Castro proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist, and in his Second Declaration of Havana he called on Latin America to rise up in revolution., , . In response, the U.S. successfully pushed the Organization of American States to expel Cuba; the Soviets privately reprimanded Castro for recklessness, although he received praise from China., , Despite their ideological affinity with China, in the Sino-Soviet Split, Cuba allied with the wealthier Soviets, who offered economic and military aid., . The ORI began shaping Cuba using the Soviet model, persecuting political opponents and perceived social deviants such as prostitutes and homosexuals; Castro considered the latter a bourgeois trait.. Government officials spoke out against his homophobia, but many gays were forced into the Military Units to Aid Production (Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producci√≥n - UMAP),. something Castro took responsibility for and regretted as a \\"great injustice\\" in 2010.\\"Castro admits 'injustice' for gays and lesbians during revolution\\", CNN, Shasta Darlington, August 31, 2010. By 1962, Cuba's economy was in steep decline, a result of poor economic management and low productivity coupled with the U.S. trade embargo. Food shortages led to rationing, resulting in protests in C√°rdenas., , . Security reports indicated that many Cubans associated austerity with the \\"Old Communists\\" of the PSP, while Castro considered a number of them - namely An√≠bal Escalante and Blas Roca - unduly loyal to Moscow. In March 1962 Castro removed the most prominent \\"Old Communists\\" from office, labelling them \\"sectarian\\"., , . On a personal level, Castro was increasingly lonely, and his relations with Che Guevara became strained as the latter became increasingly anti-Soviet and pro-Chinese., . =The Cuban Missile Crisis and furthering socialism: 1962-1968= U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. Militarily weaker than NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear missiles on Cuba to even the power balance.. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism.. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dortic√≥s and security chief Ramiro Vald√©s knew the full plan.. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive, though Castro insisted they were defensive., , . Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war.. Castro was left out of the negotiations, in which Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy.. Feeling betrayed by Khrushchev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill., , . Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, cease supporting dissidents, stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters and withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba., . In February 1963, Castro received a personal letter from Khrushchev, inviting him to visit the USSR. Deeply touched, Castro arrived in April and stayed for five weeks. He visited 14 cities, addressed a Red Square rally and watched the May Day parade from the Kremlin, was awarded an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University and became the first foreigner to receive the Order of Lenin.Bourne 1986. pp. 245-248.Coltman 2003. pp. 204-205. Castro returned to Cuba with new ideas; inspired by Soviet newspaper Pravda, he amalgamated Hoy and Revoluci√≥n into a new daily, Granma,Bourne 1986. p. 249. and oversaw large investment into Cuban sport that resulted in an increased international sporting reputation.Bourne 1986. pp. 249-250. The government agreed to temporarily permit emigration for anyone other than males aged between 15 and 26, thereby ridding the government of thousands of opponents.Coltman 2003. p. 213. In 1963 his mother died. This was the last time his private life was reported in Cuba's press.Bourne 1986. pp. 250-251. In 1964, Castro returned to Moscow, officially to sign a new five- year sugar trade agreement, but also to discuss the ramifications of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.Bourne 1986. p. 263. In October 1965, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations was officially renamed the \\"Cuban Communist Party\\" and published the membership of its Central Committee. Despite Soviet misgivings, Castro continued calling for global revolution and the funding militant leftists. He supported Che Guevara's \\"Andean project\\", an unsuccessful plan to set up a guerrilla movement in the highlands of Bolivia, Peru and Argentina, and allowed revolutionary groups from across the world, from the Viet Cong to the Black Panthers, to train in Cuba.Bourne 1986. p. 255.Coltman 2003. p. 211. He considered western-dominated Africa ripe for revolution, and sent troops and medics to aid Ahmed Ben Bella's socialist regime in Algeria during the Sand war. He also allied with Alphonse Massemba- D√©bat's socialist government in Congo-Brazzaville, and in 1965 Castro authorized Guevara to travel to Congo-Kinshasa to train revolutionaries against the western-backed government.Bourne 1986. pp. 255-256, 260.Coltman 2003. pp. 211-212. Castro was personally devastated when Guevara was subsequently killed by CIA-backed troops in Bolivia in October 1967 and publicly attributed it to Che's disregard for his own safety.Bourne 1986. pp. 267-268.Coltman 2003. p. 216. In 1966 Castro staged a Tri-Continental Conference of Africa, Asia and Latin America in Havana, further establishing himself as a significant player on the world stage.Bourne 1986. p. 265.Coltman 2003. p. 214. From this conference, Castro created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which adopted the slogan of \\"The duty of a revolution is to make revolution\\", signifying that Havana's leadership of the Latin American revolutionary movement.Bourne 1986. p. 267. Castro's increasing role on the world stage strained his relationship with the Soviets, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World.Bourne 1986. p. 269. In turn, Soviet-loyalist An√≠bal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for passing state secrets to Moscow.Bourne 1986. pp. 269-270. Castro ultimately relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 denounced the Prague Spring as led by a \\"fascist reactionary rabble\\" and praised the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.Bourne 1986. pp. 270-271.Coltman 2003. pp. 216-217. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closed all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denounced their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries.Coltman 2003. p. 227. =Economic stagnation and Third World politics: 1969‚Äì1974= In January 1969, Castro publicly celebrated his administration's tenth anniversary in Revolution Square, using the occasion to ask the assembled crowds if they would tolerate reduced sugar rations, reflecting the country's economic problems. The majority of the sugar crop was being sent to the USSR, but 1969's crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane; the government postponed the 1969/70 New Year holidays in order to lengthen the harvest. The military were drafted in, while Castro, and several other Cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats joined in.Bourne 1986. p. 273.Coltman 2003. p. 229. The country nevertheless failed that year's sugar production quota. Castro publicly offered to resign, but assembled crowds denounced the idea.Bourne 1986. p. 274.Coltman 2003. p. 230. Despite Cuba's economic problems, many of Castro's social reforms remained popular, with the population largely supportive of the \\"Achievements of the Revolution\\" in education, medical care and road construction, as well as the government's policy of \\"direct democracy\\". Cuba turned to the Soviets for economic help, and from 1970 to 1972, Soviet economists re-planned and organized the Cuban economy, founding the Cuban-Soviet Commission of Economic, Scientific and Technical Collaboration, while Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited in 1971.Bourne 1986. pp. 276-277. In July 1972, Cuba joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), an economic organization of socialist states, although this further limited Cuba's economy to agricultural production.Bourne 1986. p. 277. In May 1970, Florida-based dissident group Alpha 66 sank two Cuban fishing boats and captured their crews, demanding the release of Alpha 66 members imprisoned in Cuba. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro gained international condemnation for ordering the arrest of dissident poet Herberto Padilla. When Padilla fell ill, Castro visited him in hospital. The poet was released after publicly confessing his guilt. Soon after, the government formed the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.Coltman 2003. pp. 232-233. In November 1971 he made a state visit to Chile, where Marxist President Salvador Allende had been elected as the head of a left-wing coalition. Castro supported Allende's socialist reforms, where he toured the country to give speeches and press conferences. Suspicious of right-wing elements in the Chilean military, Castro advised Allende to purge these before they led a coup. Castro was proven right; in 1973, Chile's military led a coup d'√©tat, banned elections, executed thousands and established a military junta led by Commander-in-Chief Augusto Pinochet.Bourne 1986. pp. 278-280.Coltman 2003. pp. 233-236, 240. Castro proceeded to West Africa to meet socialist Guinean President S√©kou Tour√©, where he informed a crowd of Guineans that theirs was Africa's greatest leader.Coltman 2003. pp. 237-238. He then went on a seven-week tour visiting other leftist allies in Africa and Eurasia: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. On every trip he was eager to meet with ordinary people by visiting factories and farms, chatting and joking with them. Although publicly highly supportive of these governments, in private he urged them to do more to aid revolutionary movements in other parts of the world, in particular in the Vietnam War.Coltman 2003. p. 238. East German Politburo on his visit to the country in 1972. In September 1973, he returned to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference, particularly as he praised the Soviet Union in a speech that asserted that it was not imperialistic.Bourne 1986. pp. 283-284.Coltman 2003. p. 239. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Castro's government sent 4,000 troops to prevent Israeli forces from entering Syrian territory.Bourne 1986. p. 284. In 1974, Cuba broke off relations with Israel over the treatment of Palestinians during the Israel-Palestine conflict and their increasingly close relationship with the United States. This earned him respect from leaders throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan socialist president Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally.Coltman 2003. pp. 239-240. That year, Cuba experienced an economic boost, due primarily to the high international price of sugar, but also influenced by new trade credits with Canada, Argentina, and parts of Western Europe.Coltman 2003. p. 240. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice.Bourne 1986. p. 282. Cuba's government called the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, thereby officially announcing Cuba's status as a socialist state. It adopted a new constitution based on the Soviet model, abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro took the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.Bourne 1986. p. 283.Coltman 2003. pp. 240-241.  1976‚Äì2008 Fidel Castro served as President of Cuba from 1976 to 2008. During this time he participated in many foreign wars including the Angolan Civil War, Mozambique Civil War, Ogaden War; as well as Latin American revolutions. Castro also faced other difficulties as the President of Cuba, for instance the economic crisis that occurred during the Reagan era. As well as the deteriorating relationship between the Soviet Union and Cuba due to Glastnost and Perestroika (1980-1989). Beginning in the 1990s Castro led Cuba in an era of economic crisis known as the Special Period. During this decade Castro made many changes to the Cuban economy. Castro reformed Cuban Socialism due to the withdrawal of the Soviet's backing. Subsequently, Cuba received aid from Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, in a period known as The Pink Tide era (2000-2006). On July 31, 2006 Castro passed his duties as the President of Cuba to his brother Ra√∫l due to health reasons. Castro renounced his positions as President of the Council of State and Commander and Chief at the February 24 National Assembly meetings in a letter dated February 18, 2008. =Foreign wars and NAM Presidency: 1975‚Äì1979= Castro considered Africa to be \\"the weakest link in the imperialist chain\\", in November 1975 he ordered 230 military advisors into Southern Africa to aid the Marxist MPLA in the Angolan Civil War. When the U.S. and South Africa stepped up their support of the opposition FLNA and UNITA, Castro ordered a further 18,000 troops to Angola, which played a major role in forcing a South African retreat.Bourne 1986. p. 281, 284‚Äì287.Coltman 2003. pp. 242‚Äì243. Traveling to Angola, Castro celebrated with President Agostinho Neto, Guinea's Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© and Guinea-Bissaun President Lu√≠s Cabral, where they agreed to support the Mozambique's communist government against RENAMO in the Mozambique Civil War.Coltman 2003. p. 243. In February, Castro visited Algeria and Libya and spent ten days with Muammar Gaddafi before attending talks with the Marxist government of South Yemen. From there he proceeded to Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola where he was greeted by crowds as a hero for Cuba's role in opposing Apartheid-era South Africa.Coltman 2003. pp. 243‚Äì244. In 1977, the Ogaden War broke out as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; although a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops under the command of General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support.Coltman 2003. p. 245.Bourne 1986. pp. 291‚Äì292. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979.Coltman 2003. p. 249. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Carthage Foundation-funded Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. Fidel Castro speaking in Havana, 1978. In 1979, the Conference of the Non- Aligned Movement (NAM) was held in Havana, where Castro was selected as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders,Bourne 1986. p. 294. though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverr√≠a, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,Coltman 2003. pp. 244‚Äì245. and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents.Bourne 1986. p. 289.Coltman 2003. pp. 247‚Äì248. =Reagan and Gorbachev: 1980-1990= U.S. President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev were among the major players on the world stage in the 1980s, and would heavily affect Castro's governance of Cuba. By the 1980s, Cuba's economy was again in trouble, following a decline in the market price of sugar and 1979's decimated harvest.Coltman 2003. p. 250.Gott 2004. p. 288. Desperate for money, Cuba's government secretly sold off paintings from national collections and illicitly traded for U.S. electronic goods through Panama.Coltman 2003. p. 255. Increasing numbers of Cubans fled to Florida, who were labelled \\"scum\\" by Castro.Coltman 2003. pp. 250-251. In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy requesting asylum, and so the U.S. agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. Castro conceded that those who wanted to leave could do so from Mariel port. Hundreds of boats arrived from the U.S., leading to a mass exodus of 120,000; Castro's government took advantage of the situation by loading criminals and the mentally ill onto the boats destined for Florida.Bourne 1986. p. 295.Coltman 2003. pp. 251-252. In 1980, Ronald Reagan became U.S. president and then pursued a hard line anti-Castro approach,Bourne 1986. p. 296.Coltman 2003. p. 252. and by 1981, Castro was accusing the U.S. of biological warfare against Cuba. Although despising Argentina's right wing military junta, Castro supported them in the 1982 Falklands War against the United Kingdom and offered military aid to the Argentinians.Coltman 2003. p. 253. Castro supported the leftist New Jewel Movement that seized power in Grenada in 1979, sent doctors, teachers, and technicians to aid the country's development, and befriended the Grenadine President Maurice Bishop. When Bishop was murdered in a Soviet-backed coup by hardline Marxist Bernard Coard in October 1983, Castro cautiously continued supporting Grenada's government. However, the U.S. used the coup as a basis for invading the island. Cuban construction workers died in the conflict, with Castro denouncing the invasion and comparing the U.S. to Nazi Germany.Bourne 1986. p. 297.Coltman 2003. pp. 253-254. Castro feared a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua and sent Arnaldo Ochoa to train the governing Sandinistas in guerrilla warfare, but received little support from the Soviet Union.Coltman 2003. pp. 254-255. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. A reformer, he implemented measures to increase freedom of the press (glasnost) and economic decentralisation (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control.Coltman 2003. p. 256.Gott 2004. p. 273. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Cuba‚ÄìSoviet Union relations deteriorating.Coltman 2003. p. 257. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba.Coltman 2003. pp. 260-261.Gott 2004. p. 276. Ignoring calls for liberalisation in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency.Coltman 2003. pp. 258-266.Gott 2004. pp. 279-286. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example for the rest of the populace.Coltman 2003. p. 224. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem. Castro's image painted onto a now-destroyed lighthouse in Lobito, Angola, 1995. By November 1987, Castro began spending more time on the Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favour of d√©tente.Coltman 2003. pp. 257-258.Gott 2004. pp. 276-279. In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to capitalist reformers between 1989 and 1991 and many western observers expected the same in Cuba.Coltman 2003. p. 277.Gott 2004. p. 286. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama - despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega - but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989.Coltman 2003. pp. 267-268. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election.Coltman 2003. pp. 268-270. With the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.Coltman 2003. pp. 270-271. =The Special Period: 1991-2000= Castro in front of a Havana statue of Cuban national hero Jos√© Mart√≠ in 2003. With favourable trade from the Eastern Bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a \\"Special Period in Time of Peace.\\" Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non- essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began being used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might have to resort to subsistence farming.Coltman 2003. p. 271.Gott 2004. pp. 287-289. By 1992, the Cuban economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods.Coltman 2003. p. 282. Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in the USSR, but refrained from backing the 1991 coup in that country.Coltman 2003. pp. 274-275. When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991.Coltman 2003. p. 275. In December, the Soviet Union was officially dismantled as Boris Yeltsin abolished the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and introducing a capitalist multiparty democracy. Yeltsin despised Castro and developed links with the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. He welcomed western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended Manuel Fraga and took a particular interest in Margaret Thatcher's policies in the U.K., believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative.Coltman 2003. pp. 290-291. He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising FARC on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the Zapatistas and the Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.Coltman 2003. pp. 305-306. In 1991, Havana hosted the Pan- American Games, which involved construction of a stadium and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it was an expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds regularly shouted \\"Fidel! Fidel!\\" in front of foreign journalists, while Cuba became the first Latin American nation to beat the U.S. to the top of the gold-medal table.Coltman 2003. pp. 272-273. Support for Castro remained strong, and although there were small anti-government demonstrations, the Cuban opposition rejected the exile community's calls for an armed uprising.Coltman 2003. pp. 275-276.Gott 2004. p. 314. In August 1994, the most serious anti-Castro demonstration in Cuban history occurred in Havana, as 200 to 300 young men began throwing stones at police, demanding that they be allowed to emigrate to Miami. A larger pro- Castro crowd confronted them, and joined by Castro who informed the media that the men were anti-socials misled by U.S. media. The protests dispersed with no recorded injuries.Coltman 2003. pp. 297-299.Gott 2004. pp. 298-299. Fearing that dissident groups would invade, the government organised the \\"War of All the People\\" defence strategy, planning a widespread guerrilla warfare campaign, and the unemployed were given jobs building a network of bunkers and tunnels across the country.Coltman 2003. p. 287.Gott 2004. pp. 273-274. Castro recognised the need for reform if Cuban socialism was to survive in a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.Coltman 2003. pp. 276-281, 284, 287.Gott 2004. pp. 291-294. Castro's government decided to diversify its economy into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.Coltman 2003. p. 288.Gott 2004. pp. 290, 322. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash.Coltman 2003. p. 294. Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of Roman Catholicism and the syncretic faith of Santeria. Although he had long considered religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to the Church and religious institutions He recognised the psychological comfort it could bring, and religious people were permitted for the first time to join the Communist Party.Coltman 2003. pp. 278, 294-295.Gott 2004. p. 309. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro decided to organise a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II, which took place in January 1998; ultimately, it strengthened the position of both the Church in Cuba, and Castro's government.Coltman 2003. pp. 309-311.Gott 2004. pp. 306-310. In the early 1990s, Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against the waste of natural resources and global warming and accused the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter.Coltman 2003. p. 312. His government's environmentalist policies would prove highly effective; by 2006, Cuba was the only nation in the world which met the WWF's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8 for 2007. Similarly, Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalisation movement. He criticized U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro also maintained his devout anti-apatheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, Castro was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela would praise Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally.Coltman 2003. p. 283.Gott 2004. p. 279. He would later attend Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994.Coltman 2003. p. 304. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film. =The Pink Tide: 2000-2006= Castro meeting with center-left Brazilian President Lula da Silva, a significant \\"Pink Tide\\" leader. Mired in economic problems, Cuba would be aided by the election of socialist and anti- imperialist Hugo Ch√°vez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. In 2000, Castro and Ch√°vez signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. That same year, Castro initiated Mision Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for the crisis of fuel shortages. Evo Morales of Bolivia has described him as \\"the grandfather of all Latin American revolutionaries\\". In contrast to the improved relations between Cuba and a number of leftist Latin American states, in 2004 it broke off diplomatic ties with Panama after centrist President Mireya Moscoso pardoned four Cuban exiles accused of attempting to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro in 2000. Diplomatic ties were reinstalled in 2005 following the election of leftist President Mart√≠n Torrijos. Castro's improving relations across Latin America were accompanied by continuing animosity towards the U.S. However, after massive damage caused by Hurricane Michelle in 2001, Castro successfully proposed a one-time cash purchase of food from the U.S. while declining its government's offer of humanitarian aid. Castro expressed solidarity with the U.S. following the 2001 September 11 attacks, condemning Al Qaeda and offering Cuban airports for the emergency diversion of any U.S. planes. He recognized that the attacks would make U.S. foreign policy more aggressive, which he believed was counter- productive. Castro amid cheering crowds supporting his presidency in 2005. At a summit meeting of sixteen Caribbean countries in 1998, Castro called for regional unity, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Caribbean nations have embraced Cuba's Fidel Castro while accusing the US of breaking trade promises. Castro, until recently a regional outcast, has been increasing grants and scholarships to the Caribbean countries, while US aid to those has dropped 25% over the past five years. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community. Castro was known to be a friend of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and was an honorary pall bearer at Trudeau's funeral in October 2000. They had continued their friendship after Trudeau left office until his death. Canada became one of the first American allies openly to trade with Cuba. Cuba still has a good relationship with Canada. In 1998, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien arrived in Cuba to meet President Castro and highlight their close ties. He is the first Canadian government leader to visit the island since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976. =Stepping down: 2006-2008= Poster advertising a Mass to pray for Castro's health that was posted on a wall in Bogot√°, Colombia, in 2007. On July 31, 2006, Castro delegated all his duties to his brother Ra√∫l; the transfer was described as a temporary measure while Fidel recovered from surgery for an \\"acute intestinal crisis with sustained bleeding\\".Reaction Mixed to Castro‚Äôs Turnover of Power. PBS. August 1, 2006 In February 2007, Ra√∫l announced that Fidel's health was improving and that he was taking part in important issues of government.\\"Raul Castro Thinks Fidel Improving \\". Associated Press, February 10, 2007. Later that month, Fidel called into Hugo Ch√°vez's radio show Al√≥ Presidente, and in April, Ch√°vez told press that Castro was \\"almost totally recovered\\". On April 21, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, with Ch√°vez visiting in August,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 287. and Morales in September.Sivak 2008. p. 52. As a comment on Castro's recovery, U.S. President George W. Bush said: \\"One day the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away\\". Hearing about this, the atheist Castro ironically replied: \\"Now I understand why I survived Bush‚Äôs plans and the plans of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the good Lord protected me.\\" The quote would subsequently be picked up on by the world's media. In a letter dated February 18, 2008, Castro announced that he would not accept the positions of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief at the February 24 National Assembly meetings, stating that his health was a primary reason for his decision, remarking that \\"It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer\\". On February 24, 2008, the National Assembly of People's Power unanimously voted Ra√∫l as president. Describing his brother as \\"not substitutable\\", Ra√∫l proposed that Fidel continue to be consulted on matters of great importance, a motion unanimously approved by the 597 National Assembly members.

Sjeklocha became a member of JINSA's Board of Advisors the following year.WRMEA, 14 July 1986, Pollard and BeyondJINSA, JINSA Newsletter, III (27), March‚ÄìApril 1984 According to JINSA, the two were added to the tour at the request of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. The tour met Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and other Israeli defense personnel, and produced generally favourable coverage of Israel, with some of Sjeklocha's work re- published in the Pentagon's \\"Current News\\" newsletter. Harry V. Martin, a former editor of one of Sjeklocha's magazines, Military Electronics/Countermeasures, told Knight-Ridder in 1985 that Sjeklocha had returned from the tour with a scheme to sell weapons captured by Israel in Lebanon, telling the editor that he had been asked to be the agent for the sale. The editor protested that Sjeklocha's European Defense Associates was a publishing company and not an arms dealership, and despite Sjeklocha having an array of photographs of the captured arms, that was the last the editor knew of it.Pete Garey and Alan Gathright, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, The Day, 9 August 1985, Alleged smuggler met with Sharon The scheme (apparently without Sjeklocha's involvement) later became Operation Tipped Kettle, with the arms sold to the US at minimal cost (essentially shipping and handling fees) for supply to the Nicaraguan Contras. In December 1983 Cutter joined forces with Colonel Ralph Mark Broman, Paris chief of the Office of Defense Cooperation until 31 July 1984, becoming manager of European Defense Associates' Paris branch in March and chairman and 50% shareholder of the company in August. Cutter also made Broman editor of two of his magazines. Two arms dealers told The New York Times in 1987 that potential deals with Iran were discussed with Broman in his office before his retirement. In August 1985 Sjeklocha, owner and President of European Defense Associates, was one of seven charged with conspiracy to sell arms to Iran, including 1,104 TOW anti-tank missiles and 10 F-4 engines.Glen Elsasser, Chicago Tribune, 2 August 1985, Plot To Sell Missiles To Iran FoiledIke Flores, Associated Press, 5 November 1985, Attorney Calls Witness In Iran Arms Plot Trial 'Scum'AP, Los Angeles Times, 21 August 1985, U.S. Indicts 7 in Plot to Buy Anti-Tank Missiles for Iran Sjeklocha, the company, and one other person were convicted in December 1985, while the remaining five were acquitted on the grounds that Sjeklocha had led them to believe he was acting with government sanction.Ike Flores, Associated Press, 16 December 1985, Jury: Two Guilty In Arms-to-Iran Conspiracy According to the Orlando Sentinel, \\"Several of those defendants contended that Cutter claimed to be a U.S. intelligence officer who had secret approval from the Pentagon and the government\`s Office of Defense Cooperation in Paris to arrange the weapons shipments.

That is, the shortest programs to convert between two objects can be made maximally overlapping: For K(x\\\\mid y) \\\\leq K(y\\\\mid x) it can be divided into a program that converts object x to object y, and another program which concatenated with the first converts y to x while the concatenation of these two programs is a shortest program to convert between these objects. = Minimum overlap = The programs to convert between objects x and y can also be made minimal overlapping.

Deza, E Deza, Encyclopedia of Distances, Springer, 2009, = Practical = To determine the similarity of objects such as genomes, languages, music, internet attacks and worms, software programs, and so on, information distance is normalized and the Kolmogorov complexity terms approximated by real-world compressors (the Kolmogorov complexity is a lower bound to the length in bits of a compressed version of the object). The result is the normalized compression distance (NCD) between the objects. This pertains to objects given as computer files like the genome of a mouse or text of a book. If the objects are just given by name such as \`Einstein' or \`table' or the name of a book or the name \`mouse', compression does not make sense. We need outside information about what the name means. Using a data base (such as the internet) and a means to search the database (such as a search engine like Google) provides this information. Every search engine on a data base that provides aggregate page counts can be used in the normalized Google distance (NGD).

Designed by Captain Samuel Brown and the Aberdeen City Architect John Smith, it was opened to pedestrians in November 1830 and to traffic in May 1831. The chain bridge was closed in 1984 to vehicles and then pedestrians in 2002, but was restored in 2006/07 and pedestrian use was re-instated in 2008. History Aberdeen was undergoing rapid expansion in the early 19th century and landowners in Torry, the Menzies family of Pitfodels, wished to capitalise on the opportunities arising from the establishment of the turnpike road between Aberdeen and Stonehaven in 1799. A series of legal disputes as to exact ownership of the lands ended in arbitration. An Act of Parliament was eventually obtained by the Heritors of Nigg and the Road Trustees in 1828 for a bridge to replace the Craiglug Ferry. The City Architect in Aberdeen John Smith and his rival Archibald Simpson were asked to tender design proposals for the bridge and its approach roads from the north and south side in June 1829. The design for the architectural sections was awarded to Smith working in collaboration with Captain Samuel Brown who undertook the engineering designs of the suspension and span. The metalwork was manufactured at the nearby Ferryhill Foundry owned by James Abernethy (1809‚Äì1879), a cousin of James Abernethy. Abernethy was the engineer who supervised the work. In March 1830 the trustees chose to name the bridge after the Iron Duke, Wellington, although it is also known as the Chain Bridge and the Craiglug Bridge. The foundation stone was put in place in 1829 and the bridge was in pedestrian use from November 1830. Six months later, in May 1831, it was opened to use by vehicles. The costs of building the bridge totalled ¬£10,000. Construction Pairs of bar-link saddle chains one above another with suspender rods hold the deck, which is in length and wide. Thomas Telford's method of \\"three lines of rectangular cross-section eye-bar links with short connecting links and cross-bolted\\" was copied from his 1822 Menai Suspension Bridge construction. The chains were installed on either side of the deck, one above the other with a dip of , giving a span ratio of 1:12. James Slight described the bridge as \\"the strongest bridge that Capt. Brown has yet erected\\" and he assessed the highest chain stress was around \\"812 tons sq. in. and all the bars were proved to 9 tons sq. in.\\" The chains bear the stamp \\"Cable TF&S\\" and were obtained from Thomson, Forman and Son, of Pontypridd. The chains are anchored at each end to twin pylons with semi- circular archways; these were constructed from bull-faced granite by Robert Mearns. Modifications were made to the north end archway in 1886 and a stone engraved with the date is mounted at the apex of the arch to signify this. The approach roads, designed by Smith with the bridge, were in length and incorporated a slow ramp from College Street on the northern side; a new road also ran from around Nigg to the Craiglug side on the south approach. An octagonal toll house, also designed by Smith, was originally sited on the northwest corner of the bridge. The architectural pylon on the Torry side of the bridge Restoration The bridge underwent some restoration work in 1930 when steel replaced the cast iron bearers and wrought iron suspenders. Of the original iron work, only the main chains remained. The toll house was derelict in 1964 and was demolished soon after. Further restoration work was done on the bridge in 1984 after a replacement bridge, the Queen Elizabeth II bridge, was finished, as this enabled the suspension bridge to be closed to vehicles. Due to safety concerns, in 2002 it was also closed to pedestrians. After Aberdeen City Council engineers undertook further work to preserve and strengthen the bridge, it resumed use as a pedestrian walkway and cycle lane in 2008. The main chains were still retained. The work was carried out in four phases. The first step comprised repairing welding of the main chains and saddle chain replacement. The next stage involved renewing the timber decking and structural re-painting. Phase three concentrated on the granite towers and included re-pointing and cleaning; the final stage was to provide architectural lighting. Total costs were estimated at ¬£760,000 and were expected to preserve the bridge for another century. Aberdeen City councillors were informed in October 2007 that the cost for the first three phases had increased to ¬£995,000 and the estimate for the final stage would be ¬£100,000. From 1979 until 2010 it was listed as a scheduled monument; from 2010, it was included on the list of Category A listed structures.

Having qualified as a barrister, from March 1916 onwards he acted as counsel for the Admiralty in the many prize law claims arising from the capture or sinking of enemy vessels by British ships during the war. Although many countries (including Germany and the USA) had abjured the use of prize money by 1914, Britain and France signed an agreement that November establishing government jurisdiction over prizes captured singly or jointly by the signatories.Convention Relating to Prizes Captured during the Present European War. American Journal of International Law, 10:20-25 Russia and Italy acceded in March 1915 and January 1917 respectively.Text of Russian letter of accession: American Journal of International Law, 10:26-27/Text of Italian letter of accession: American Journal of International Law, 11:130-131 In Britain, until the passing of the Navy Prize Act 1918 a bounty was paid to all ships present at an enemy vessel's actual destruction; each man on board the victorious ship(s), without distinction of rank, shared the money awarded by the court, based on the sum of ¬£5 ($25) for each man on board the enemy ship. For example, a captured or sunk battleship with a complement of 453 officers and men (confirmed as soon as possible by affidavit) was worth ¬£2,265. Anderson published his preparatory research into the legal questions surrounding the subject in his book Navy and prize: an essay . This concise volume reviewed the state of maritime law regarding prize bounty, salvage, and recapture. The war-time claims were heard in the Prize Court, part of the Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice; its President at the time was Sir Samuel Evans. The Admiralty's counsel appeared on behalf of the ships' officers and crew, and the Crown counsel's job (according to Anderson) was partly to ensure that the court was not over-generous in its awards.The Times, 28 March 1916, p. 3.

Anderson's later cases in the Prize Court include: * The first actual engagement of the war, the sinking of the auxiliary cruiser SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse in August 1914 (case heard 3 July 1916) * Siege of Tsingtao, October-November 1914: seven German warships (case heard 23 April 1917). The motion revolved around a point of law: whether the involvement of the Army in the combined action took the claim outside the provisions of the Navy Prize Act 1864. Anderson, with a sense of history, drily noted that the last time this type of claim had been heard in the Court was a hundred years earlier, regarding La Bellone.Bellone was the flagship of the French squadron involved in the defence of the √éle de France (Mauritius) at the Battle of Grand Port, and was captured when the island fell on 8 December 1810 after combined British Army and Naval operations. Judgement was reserved. * Battle of the Falkland Islands, December 1914, in which the armoured cruisers and were sunk, along with the light cruisers , and .

Among these were: * , scuttled July 1915 in the Rufiji River in east Africa: the first RNAS claim. Motion upheld. * The sinking in January 1918 of the Midilli (the former SMS Breslau) during the Battle of Imbros, when several aircraft from took part in the action. This was the first prize claim (worth ¬£2,750) involving the newly formed Royal Air Force. Among the air observers and pilots involved was the future Air Marshal Ralph Sorley.Flight magazine Archive 6 February 1919, page 181 and page 190 The court upheld the claim. These cases established a precedent relating to the application in the air of the principles of maritime prize law: it eventually found its way into UK legislation in the Prize Act 1939, replacing the Naval Prize Acts of 1864 and 1918.

She began acting in her teens and spent most of her career in London, playing in Shakespeare, Victorian burlesque, and a range of drama and comedy roles. Early life and work Bufton was born in Llanbister, Wales, to Mary Bufton.Joseph Knight, ‚ÄòBufton, Eleanor (1842‚Äì1893)‚Äô, rev. J.

Life and work Kenneth Laudon graduated from Stanford University and has a Ph.D from Columbia University. Laudon's first book, Computers and Bureaucratic Reform: The Political Functions of Urban Information Systems (John Wiley and Sons, 1974) was an early study of the use of computers in government.James W. Cortada, The Digital Hand, Vol. 3: How Computers Changed the Work of American Public Sector Industries, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 445 Laudon's second book, Communications Technology and Democratic Participation (Praeger Publishing, 1978) has been cited as a \\"pioneering work\\" on the impact of information technology on the development of different types of democracies.Chadwick Andrew and Christopher May, \\"Interaction between States and Citizens in the Age of the Internet: 'e-Government' in the United States, Britain, and the European Union,\\" Governance, Volume 16, Issue 2, pp. 271-300, April 2003 Laudon's third book was Dossier Society: Value Choices in the Design of National Information Systems (Columbia University Press, 1986). In Dossier Society, Laudon argued that the design and uses of new computing and telecommunications systems, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Computerized Criminal History System, were creating what he called a ‚Äúdossier society‚Äù that would be increasingly based on a person‚Äôs data image. Laudon subsequently authored an influential article, \\"Markets and Privacy\\" (Communications of the ACM, 1996). This article proposed that people should have a property right in their personal information, enabling them to sell that information, perhaps through a national information market. This article has been recognized as one of the first to suggest a propertization of information privacy as well as the institutional infrastructure that might be used to make such an information property rights system a reality. A follow-on paper published by the U.S. Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration discusses how personal information might be priced. Laudon's work has recently been cited as a source for a proposal that Facebook create an information market and pay its users in exchange for their information or attitudes. Laudon is also the author a number of academic articles with respect to the impacts of information systems. Professor Laudon is also well known as the co-author of a number of textbooks, including Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm and E-commerce. Business. Technology. Society.

It encompasses the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial (1924) and the 6-acre Capitol Reflecting Pool (1971) and is just west of the United States Capitol building. Views differ as to whether the Square is just east of the National Mall or is itself the eastern end.

History The area constituting Union Square was originally part of the U.S. Capitol complex, but beginning in the 1930s the National Park Service assumed jurisdiction over the site. In 2011, the 112th United States Congress enacted the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012, which transferred to the Architect of the Capitol the NPS \\"property which is bounded on the north by Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, on the east by First Street Northwest and First Street Southwest, on the south by Maryland Avenue Southwest, and on the west by Third Street Southwest and Third Street Northwest\\". The Act removed Union Square from NPS jurisdiction. The transfer of ownership occasioned some controversy as the NPS had planned to enhance the area to accommodate political demonstrations, gatherings and entertainment events. The NPS expressed surprise at the move and some advocates for protest groups complained, asserting that the Architect of the Capitol and the United States Capitol Police (who were now responsible for security) were likely to be less tactful and accommodating to demonstrators than the Park Police. A Washington Post writer stated: \\"Although definitions of what constitutes the [National] Mall vary, the [2011] provision, in a sense, moves its easternmost boundary west ‚Äî from First Street to Third Street.\\" References Landmarks in Washington, D.C.

It is located at 3908 Richardson Road, Independence, KY 41051. All three of the courses offer low handicappers, as well as the average golfer challenging and fun layouts. The Pioneer is the shortest of the courses playing to a par 71. As the name indicates, it was the first course built at the complex in 1968. The Pioneer course is 5,880 yards with a rating of 68.4, a slope of 115. It is like most mid-western courses, slightly sloping on the front nine with increasing slopes on the back. Easily the most walkable course at the complex. Power carts are optional and they may be taken across the fairway at 90 degrees. The Willows, designed by Dr. Michael Hurdzan, offers golfers a scenic and challenging test of tree-lined fairways and undulating greens. The Willows course plays to 6,697 yards from the championship tees, rated 9th in Kentucky. Par 72, and the course rating is 72.6 and the slope is 137. The Willows is a real challenge of golf, for any level player. Power carts are optional, and are permitted to cross at 90 degrees. Fox Run, another masterpiece by renowned architect Arthur Hills, this distinctively different golf course provides a wonderful blend of architectural style from hole to hole. Here you will find links-type holes which somewhat resemble that of a Scottish golf course. There is a sampling of Carolina-type holes with drastic changes in elevation from tee to green. Finally, there is a balance of more traditional mid-western style golf holes: all of which gracefully blend with the natural terrain and surrounding environment. The absence of housing and condo developments within the course allows the golfer to truly experience nature in its spectacular beauty. This course is consistently rated one of the most challenging public courses in the State of Kentucky. Kenton County Golf Course also has a driving range and a clubhouse with a pro-shop, a bar, and a wide variety of food.http://kentoncounty.org/county_departments/golf_course/docs/GolfOutingPAckages.pdf Billy Casper Golf was named as the new management company for the golf courses in December 2019 https://thegolfwire.com/kenton-county-golf-courses-gm/ Kenton County hired a consultant in 2019 to provide recommendations as to possible redevelopment of part or all of the property.

The attempt to remove Kim failed and the participants were arrested and later executed. Through this political struggle, Kim Il-sung quashed all opposition to him within the central party leadership.  Background  Kim Il-sung sent out preliminary signals in late 1955 and early 1956, before the 3rd Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), that he was preparing to move against the Yan'an and Soviet factions. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a bombshell with Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech denouncing Joseph Stalin and the inauguration of de-Stalinization. Throughout the Soviet Bloc domestic Communist parties inaugurated campaigns against personality cults and the general secretaries who modelled themselves after Stalin were deposed throughout Eastern Europe. Kim Il-sung was summoned to Moscow for six weeks in the summer of 1956 in order to receive a dressing down from Khrushchev, who wished to bring North Korea in line with the new orthodoxy. During Kim Il- sung's absence, Pak Chang-ok (the new leader of the Soviet faction after the suicide of Ho Ka-i), Choe Chang-ik, and other leading members of the Yan'an faction devised a plan to attack Kim Il-sung at the next plenum of the Central Committee and criticise him for not \\"correcting\\" his leadership methods, developing a personality cult, distorting the \\"Leninist principle of collective leadership\\" his \\"distortions of socialist legality\\" (i.e. using arbitrary arrest and executions) and use other Khrushchev-era criticisms of Stalinism against Kim Il-sung's leadership.  Political struggle  Kim Il- sung became aware of the plan upon his return from Moscow and responded by delaying the plenum by almost a month. When the plenum finally opened on August 30 Choe Chang-ik made a speech attacking Kim Il-sung for concentrating the power of the party and the state in his own hands as well as criticising the party line on industrialisation which ignored widespread starvation among the North Korean people. Yun Kong-hum attacked Kim Il-sung for creating a \\"police regime\\". Kim Il-sung's supporters heckled and berated the speakers rendering them almost inaudible and destroying their ability to persuade members. Kim Il-sung's supporters accused the opposition of being \\"anti-Party\\" and moved to expel Yun from the party. Kim Il-sung, in response, neutralised the attack on him by promising to inaugurate changes and moderate the regime, promises which were never kept. The majority in the committee voted to support Kim Il-sung and also voted in favor of repressing the opposition, expelling Choe and Pak from the Central Committee. A few leaders of the Yan'an faction fled to China to escape the purges that followed the August plenum, while supporters of the Soviet faction and Yan'an faction were rounded up. Though Kim Tu-bong, the leader of the Yan'an faction and nominal President of North Korea, was not directly involved in the attempt on Kim, he was ultimately purged in 1958, accused of being the \\"mastermind\\" of the plot. Kim Tu-bong \\"disappeared\\" after his removal from power, and likely was either executed or died in prison. In September 1956, a joint Soviet-Chinese delegation went to Pyongyang to instruct Kim Il-sung to cease any purge and reinstate the leaders of the Yan'an and Soviet factions. A second plenum of the Central Committee, held on September 23, 1956, officially pardoned the leaders of the August opposition attempt and rehabilitated them, but in 1957 the purges resumed, and, by 1958, the Yan'an faction had ceased to exist. Members of the Soviet faction, meanwhile, facing increased harassment, decided to return to the Soviet Union in increasing numbers. By 1959, the purges had been so ravaging that more than a quarter of seats in the Supreme People's Assembly were vacant. A special by-election had to be organized in July that year. By 1961, the only faction left was Kim Il-sung's own Guerrilla faction, along with members who had joined the WPK under Kim Il-sung's leadership and were loyal to him. In the 1961 Central Committee, there were only two members of the Soviet faction, three members of the Yan'an faction and three members of the Domestic faction left out of a total Central Committee membership of 68. These individuals were personally loyal to Kim Il-sung and were trusted by him; however, by the late 1960s, even these individuals were almost all purged. One likely reason for the failure of the Soviet and Yan'an factions to depose Kim Il-sung was the nationalist view by younger members of the party who had joined since 1950 that the members of these factions were \\"foreigners\\" influenced by alien powers while Kim Il-sung was seen as a true Korean. According to Kim Il-sung's biographer, Dae-Sook Suh: \\"[Kim]'s long struggle to consolidate power was complete ... There were no longer any factions to challenge his position, and, for the first time, no foreign armed forces were occupying the North\\".

Continuous rain over two days resulted in the overflowing of the rivers in the northeastern part of Sardinia, flooding villages like Torp√® and towns such as Olbia, Nuoro and Oristano. The cyclone brought extremely heavy rain to the island of Sardinia as more than of rain fell in 90 minutes on the morning of 19 November, resulting in flooding and swollen rivers bursting their banks. The area around the north-eastern city of Olbia has been affected the worst, where up to of water has left cars and homes submerged. Further afield, ferry services between Naples and the islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida were affected by gale-force winds and heavy seas, with bad weather spreading to Calabria and Campania on the Southern Italian mainland. As far north as Rome, authorities were monitoring the Tiber river. Aftermath At least 18 people died as a result of the flooding in Sardinia. Enrico Letta, the Italian prime minister, declared a state of emergency on the island, describing it as a \\"national tragedy\\", promising 20 million euro for the reconstruction.

It tells the true story of French officer Georges Picquart from 1896-1906, as he struggles to expose the truth about the doctored evidence that sent Alfred Dreyfus to Devil's Island. Plot summary Upon being promoted to run the Statistical Section, the top secret headquarters of French military intelligence, Georges Picquart begins to discover that the evidence used to convict Alfred Dreyfus of espionage, which resulted in his imprisonment for life on Devil's Island, is flimsy at best. As he investigates further, he discovers that the military and the government doctored much of the evidence. Moreover, the spy who actually passed the information Dreyfus was convicted of sending to the Germans is, in fact, still operating. Warned off the investigation by his superiors, Picquart persists, risking his career and his life, to free an innocent man from unjust imprisonment - and to stop a spy operating within the military, who has gone unpunished. Reception The novel won the Walter Scott Prize (2014), and the American Library in Paris Book Award (2014). Film Robert Harris was inspired to write the novel by his friend Roman Polanski's longtime interest in the Dreyfus affair. Harris followed up the novel with a script of the same story, titled D, with Polanski announced as director in 2012. Although set in Paris, the film was initially scheduled to shoot in Warsaw in 2014, for economic reasons. However, production was postponed after Polanski moved to Poland for filming and the U.S. Government filed extradition papers. The Polish government eventually rejected them, by which time new French film tax credits had been introduced, allowing the film to shoot on location in Paris. It was budgeted at 60 million euros and was again set to start production in July 2016, however its production was postponed again as Polanski waited on the availability of a star, whose name was not announced. It was announced in September 2018 that the project had been retitled J'accuse, and would go into production in the fall of 2018, starring Jean Dujardin as Picquart and co- starring Mathieu Amalric and Olivier Gourmet. It is produced by Alain Goldman and distributed by Gaumont.

The underlying Scheme programming language has a long tradition of use in theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and rapid program development.  History  The Scheme programming language was designed as a simplified and more abstract variant of the early Lisp programming language. The first Lisp implementation was available in 1958, Scheme was introduced in 1975. Development of LambdaNative toolkit started in 2009 at the Pediatric Anesthesia Research Team (PART) in Vancouver, Canada. It was initially used as an in-house platform for a closed- loop intravenous anesthesia system. Support for mobile platforms was added as PART became engaged in global health projects in 2010. The core LambdaNative framework was open-sourced in 2013.  Features  LambdaNative combines the possibilities of a rapid prototyping environment using Scheme and C programming languages (feature of the underlying Gambit-C implementation) with easy cross-platform software generation and a set of modules including GUI programming, fast Fourier transform and modules to access typical phone hardware components such as camera, GPS and audio. = Licensing = LambdaNative is released under the BSD License. = Platforms = LambdaNative supports building native applications for the following operating systems: * Mobile: iOS, Android, BlackBerry 10 * Desktop: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, OpenBSD * Embedded: OpenWrt = Scheme based development = LambdaNative applications are written in the Scheme language which can be easily mixed with C code. Scheme is a high level functional language with a very simple and expressive syntax. LambdaNative uses Gambit-C Scheme, a portable standards- compliant Scheme to C compiler. Applications written in the framework can be either event-loop driven graphical applications or console applications, and code can be abstracted in the form of modules and plugins. LambdaNative does not require the use of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The build system follows the conventional configure, make, make install command format. = Graphics and user interface= LambdaNative utilizes the OpenGL and OpenGL ES hardware accelerated graphics layer on the target platforms, and provides a full widget-based 2D graphics engine. It is also possible to render 3D scenes, and overlay a 2D user interface. The cross-platform GUI is based on the highly portable glGUI widget toolkit. = Audio = LambdaNative supports both playback of audio files (OGG or WAV) format, and real-time full-duplex bidirectional audio. = Sensors = LambdaNative supports access to accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS locators and other sensors where available on mobile devices.  Applications built with LambdaNative  LambdaNative has been used for a diverse range of medical applications, for example the Phone Oximeter, a smartphone based low-cost pulse oximeter. The Phone Oximeter was selected as one of the ten innovations for 2015 to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to decrease maternal and child mortality. LambdaNative-based applications have been used in clinical trials on >50,000 subjects in Canada, France, India, Uganda, Bangladesh, and South Africa, in >10 separate clinical studies.

He was born in London the son of Hugh Barker, an engineer, and Joye, a concert cellist. At Oundle School, he developed an interest in Natural History and was given special access to the biology classrooms to study his finds. The Natural History Museum later asked him to mount an expedition to collect plant specimens from the Icelandic offshore island of Grimsey.Cooper C (2013) David Barker Obituary, The Guardian Wednesday 11 September 2013. He studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, London, but maintained his interest in Natural History, and had his first paper published in Nature in 1961. After qualifying in 1962, he became a research fellow in the department of social medicine at Birmingham University. In 1969, with a grant from the Medical Research Council, Barker moved with his family to Uganda, to research Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (\\"Buruli ulcer\\"), demonstrating that it was caused, not by mosquitos, but by wounds caused by the razor-sharp reeds growing near the River Nile. He returned to England and in 1979 was appointed professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Southampton medical school, and in 1984 director of the Medical Research Council Environmental Epidemiology Unit, now the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit. There he made the observations on the geographical relationship between neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and heart disease. He won the GlaxoSmithKline Prize in 1994 for this work. Barker was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998 and was appointed a CBE in 2006.

He raced only as a two-year-old, with his career being restricted to a period of less than four months between April and August 1983. After winning a highly competitive maiden race on his racecourse debut he went on to win the National Stakes, Norfolk Stakes, Molecomb Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In all, he was unbeaten in five races and was never seriously challenged. Shortly after his win in the Gimcrack he sustained an injury which ended his racing career. He stood as a breeding stallion in England and Sweden with moderate results and died in 2006. Background Precocious was a dark-coated bay horse with a broad white blaze and a white sock on his left hind foot bred by his owner, the Marquess of Tavistock at his Bloomsbury Stud at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire. He was the eighth of fifteen foals produced by Tavistock's broodmare Mrs Moss: most of her other winners were fast-maturing sprinters including Krayyan (National Stakes) and Pushy (Queen Mary Stakes), but the best of her offspring was probably Jupiter Island who won the Japan Cup as a seven-year-old in 1986. Precocious's sire Mummy's Pet, was a pure sprinter whose biggest wins came in the Flying Childers Stakes and Temple Stakes. Most of his best offspring were also sprinters, including Runnett (Haydock Sprint Cup), Mummy's Game (Temple Stakes), Tina's Pet (King George Stakes), Petorius (Temple Stakes), Colmore Row (Norfolk Stakes) and Chummy's Special (Norfolk Stakes). The colt was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket and was ridden in his races by the veteran English jockey Lester Piggott. Racing career =1983: two-year-old season= Precocious's early training was disrupted by problems with his knees, and he was given a six-week break in early spring. The colt began his racing career in the Philip Cornes Nickel Alloys qualifier, a maiden race over five furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 April. He started favourite and won impressively by three lengths from King of Clubs, with Maajid in third place. King of Clubs later emerged as a top-class racehorse, winning several major races including the Premio Emilio Turati and the Premio Vittorio di Capua. Precocious's next race was the Listed National Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. He produced what Timeform described as a \\"tremendously smooth display\\" to win easily from four opponents. On 16 June, Precocious was moved up in class for the Group Three Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot for which he started at odds of 4/11 in a field which included several other winners. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew clear of his rivals to win by three lengths without Piggott having to exert any more than the bare minimum of pressure. At Goodwood Racecourse in July, Precocious started at odds of 30/100 despite being required to concede seven pounds to the rest of the runners in the Group Three Molecomb Stakes. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from the filly Sajeda. In August Precocious was moved up in distance to contest the Group Two Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse. He started the 8/11 favourite, with the previously undefeated Al Mamoon being the only horse seriously backed against him. Precocious looked extremely impressive before the race in contrast to Al Mamoon, who sweated heavily and appeared nervous and agitated. The race was no contest, as Precocious took the lead approaching the final quarter mile and drew away from his rivals to win very impressively by six lengths from Adams Peak. In the final yards his stride became somewhat \\"scratchy\\" leading to some speculation that he was reaching the end of his stamina. Two weeks after his win at York, Precocious sustained an injury in his stable and missed intended runs in the Flying Childers Stakes and Middle Park Stakes. Assessment In 1981, the independent Timeform organisation gave Precocious a rating of 126, five pounds below the top-rated two-year-old El Gran Senor. In the official International Classification, he was less highly regarded, being rated thirteen pounds inferior to El Gran Senor. Stud record Precocious never fully recovered from his injuries and was retired to stud for the 1985 season. He was based at the New England Stud in Newmarket and also stood for a time in Sweden. By far the best of his offspring was the sprinter Elbio, which won the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in 1991 and 1993. Precocious was euthanised at the Bloomsbury stud on 25 August 2006 at the age of twenty-five.

Lead-up to the game The host Nittany Lions were ranked #8 in the AP Poll in the week leading up to the game with #2 Nebraska. Both teams were undefeated (Nebraska had beaten Iowa and New Mexico State, while Penn State had defeated rivals Temple, Maryland and Rutgers).Joe Paterno:The Road to 327. Birmingham: Epic Sports Classics, 2002, page 109. The game =First quarter= Penn State drew first blood in the first quarter on a six-play, 83-yard drive that culminated in a touchdown pass from Todd Blackledge to Kirk Bowman. Massimo Manca's extra point made it 7‚Äì0 Penn State.Joe Paterno:The Road to 327. Birmingham: Epic Sports Classics, 2002, page 58. =Second quarter= Penn State scored again in the second quarter, this time on a six-play, 71-yard drive that culminated in a Curt Warner touchdown run from the Nebraska 2. The score was 14‚Äì0 Penn State after the extra point by Manca.Joe Paterno:The Road to 327. Birmingham: Epic Sports Classics, 2002, pages 58‚Äì59. Late in the half, Nebraska got on the board after a seven-play, 80-yard drive culminated in a Turner Gill touchdown pass followed by the extra point by Kevin Seibel. The score was 14‚Äì7 Penn State at the half. =Third quarter= Penn State scored again in the third quarter, this time on a seven-play, 83-yard drive on a touchdown pass from Blackledge to Kenny Jackson. Manca's third extra point made it 21‚Äì7 Penn State. However, Nebraska scored again, this time on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown to make it 21‚Äì14 Penn State after three quarters following Seibel's extra point. =Fourth quarter= Following a fumble by Penn State's backup tailback Skeeter Nichols (replacing Warner, who left the game early in the third quarter with muscle cramps) that was recovered by Nebraska at their own 44 yard line, Nebraska moved to the Penn State 20 before settling for a Seibel field goal to make the score 21‚Äì17 Penn State. Nebraska would take its only lead of the afternoon on an 80-yard drive after intercepting a Blackledge pass in the end zone, leading to a touchdown to make the score 24‚Äì21 Nebraska. Final drive Penn State returned the ensuing kickoff to their own 20 yard line, but Nebraska's David Ridder was flagged for a personal foul. The fifteen yard penalty saw the final drive start from the Penn State 35.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125981/index.htm Blackledge led Penn State down the field to the Nebraska 28, where the drive appeared to have stalled, but on fourth down and 11, Penn State kept the drive alive when Blackledge completed a pass to Jackson for a first down. The next completion ended up being controversial. On second down and four yards to go, Blackledge threw a 15-yard pass to Mike McCloskey. Replays appeared to show the pass was caught out of bounds, however the linesman ruled him in-bounds. At the time, instant replay could not be used to overturn calls made on the field. This set up first and goal from the Nebraska 2 yard line with nine seconds remaining on the clock. Nebraska defensive players thought McCloskey was out of bounds, but without the benefit of instant replay, Penn State took advantage and Blackledge hooked up with Bowman on the winning touchdown pass with 4 seconds left. It wasn‚Äôt certain to Nebraska‚Äôs defenders that Bowman made a legal catch of the final pass. Manca's extra point attempt was no good, so the score was 27‚Äì24 Penn State. Nebraska failed to return the ensuing kickoff past their own 35, making the 27‚Äì24 score official in favor of Penn State. Aftermath Nebraska dropped to #8 after the loss, but ran the table over the remainder of the season, including a win over #13 LSU in the Orange Bowl. Penn State moved up to #4 after the win (then to #3 following a bye week), then lost to #5 Alabama to fall back to #8. But they ran the table over the remainder of the regular season, and went on to win their first consensus national championship in the Sugar Bowl by defeating top-ranked Georgia (who were led by Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker), 27‚Äì23. The win over Nebraska was the signature win of Penn State's first national championship season. Nebraska would get revenge the next season by defeating Penn State in the inaugural Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium 44‚Äì6. In 1998, Mike McClosky admitted at a speaking engagement that he was in fact \\"out of bounds\\". Blackledge commented that perhaps the worst call in Nebraska history was a break for the Nittany Lions.

Merzalben sheet, 1912 edition. as an observation tower. It is made of bunter sandstone.  History and construction  Tablet with dates and construction history of the Luitpold Tower The idea of building a tower was conceived on 29 May 1895 at the general assembly of the Gr√§fenstein Conservation Society (Gr√§fensteiner Versch√∂nerungsverein), a group that forestry assessor August Zwissler from Leimen had founded in 1893. It was decided to build a viewing tower on the Wei√üenberg costing an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 gold marks. The necessary funding would be raised by society member Martin J√§ger, a well known local poet who went under the pseudonym, Fritz Claus. Thanks to his support for the tower he was able to win the Palatine Forest Club, founded in 1902 in Ludwigshafen, to his cause. The leadership of the PWV took over the coordination of the project, had the plans produced by architect Ludwig Ullmann and gathered the necessary funding, predominantly from membership subscriptions. Its name was proposed by Karl Albrecht von Ritter, the chairman of the PWV at the time; it was named after Prince Luitpold of Bavaria.Lang (2009) pp. 71‚Äì82 In 1908 construction on the tower began and it was inaugurated on 26 September 1909.Marianne Teuscher: Liebe auf den ersten Blick. (pdf, 145 KB) Article in Die Rheinpfalz on 25 September 2009. The costs came to around 23,000 gold marks, which corresponds to a sum of about ‚Ç¨250,000 in 2000.Lang (2009) p. 82, has assessed its costs in present-day terms (as at 2000) with the assistance of a specific construction cost index as ‚Ç¨256,000. In doing so he referred to Rolf Brachmann/Peter Holzner/Franz Wilhelm Ross: Ermittlung des Bauwertes von Geb√§uden und des Verkehrswertes von Grundst√ºcken. 28th edn., Oppermann Verlag, Hanover, 1997 The payment of this amount was concluded in 1911 by the Palatine Forest Club.Lang (2009), p. 82  Design  The tower seen from the south The Luitpold Tower is a rectangular structure built of hewn sandstone blocks and comprises a perron, the actual observation tower itself and an attached building annexe The tower is 34.6 metres high, and the viewing platform is 28.5 metres above ground level. From platform level there is a further, small staircase tower with a door and slate roof. The annexe After climbing the perron, the visitor enters a staircase tower, well-lit by multiple window openings. There are 164 steps to the observation deck. Halfway up, there is a small oriel window with a bench that can be used to rest. The upper portion of the tower is occupied by a spacious room with a relatively narrow, metallic spiral staircase in the centre, leading to the top. The visitor leaves the staircase turret through a metal door and finally enters the viewing platform, which is surrounded by a sandstone balustrade, approximately waist high, with four observation niches. In 2002, 12 tablets were mounted on this parapet at regular intervals, which point out places of interest that may be seen from the tower, both close to and in the far distance, together with distance information. Rest room in the annexe of the Luitpold Tower At the foot of the tower is an annexe, intended as a resting place and also as a refuge in case of inclement weather. It contains a stone table and benches, a fireplace and a plaque on which essential data about the tower and its architectural history are documented.  Renovation and conservation  The building has been protected since 1993 and was thoroughly renovated in 2000 and 2001. This entailed improving the structural geometry of the tower and adding a concrete ceiling to the viewing platform. There was also no way round a modification to the iron spiral staircase and a renewal of the roof. The overall cost came to ‚Ç¨230,000, almost the same amount originally needed for the construction of the tower. Upon completion of these renovations, the tower was opened to the public again in a ceremony on 28 August 2001.Lang (2009), p. 84 To support the longer term maintenance of the tower, the Luitpold Tower Club (Luitpoldturmverein) was set up in 2007. Its aim is to \\"conserve, and where possible improve, the structural state of the tower ... to ensure free access to the tower at any time as well an unobstructed panoramic view for all ... and to keep the public aware of the tower and the extensive views that can be experienced.\\"Luitpoldturmverein e.

Salim bin Sultan was son of Sultan bin Ahmad, who ruled Oman from 1792 to 1804. Sultan bin Ahmad died in 1804 on an expedition to Basra. He appointed Mohammed bin Nasir bin Mohammed al-Jabry as the Regent and guardian of his two sons, Salim bin Sultan and Said bin Sultan. Sultan's brother Qais bin Ahmad, ruler of Sohar, decided to attempt to seize power. Early in 1805 Qais and his brother Mohammed marched south along the coast to Muttrah, which he easily captured. Qais then started to besiege Muscat. Mohammed bin Nasir tried to bribe Qais to leave, but did not succeed. Mohammed bin Nasir called on Badr bin Saif for help. After a series of engagements, Qais was forced to retire to Sohar. Badr bin Saif became the effective ruler. Allied with the Wahhabis, Badr bin Saif became increasingly unpopular. To get his wards out of the way, Badr bin Saif made Salim bin Sultan governor of Al Ma≈üna‚Äòah, on the Batinah coast and Said bin Sultan governor of Barka. In 1806 Said bin Sultan lured Badr bin Saif to Barka and murdered him nearby. Said was proclaimed ruler of Oman. Said bin Sultan became the sole ruler, apparently with the consent of his brother. Their aunt, the daughter of the Imam Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, seems to have influenced this decision. Around the end of May 1810 Salim bin Sultan was sent on a mission to Persia to seek assistance in the struggle against the Wahhabis in the north of Oman. Sayyid Salem bin Sultan bin Imam Ahmed bin Saeed Al Busaidi was very kind to people humble and always smiling firmly on the oppressor and fair to the oppressed and loving all, especially scholars, jurists, people of prose, systems and mystics, and everyone witnessed his righteousness, worship and standing for the night always in the Wakil Mosque built by Sayyid Khalfan Binh Muhammad Al-Busaidi (the agent) in 1182 AH. A group of the best men of his time made him worthy of advice to him, such as Mr. Muhanna bin Khalfan Al Busaidi, Sheikh Khamis bin Salem Al Hashimi, Sheikh Saif bin Saeed Al Maawali, Judge Abu Al Ahwal Salem bin Muhammad Al Darmaki, his son Sheikh Hamid bin Salem, and the scholar Sheikh Thunayan Bin Nasser Bin Khalaf Al Zamili Al Fasih And the eloquent Sheikh, and other scholars and jurists. His council was not without scholars and writers, and he was a good and knowledgeable reader, and he memorized many pre-Islamic Arab poetry and was well informed about the history and news of their kalukes and their times. His council conspired to mention jurisprudential rulings, eloquence, various sciences and past and contemporary conditions, especially the Arab region in general and the Gulf in particular. And he knew it by always repeating it in his home assembly I told them, and at night he was lying black, with his robe in sight Keep what is left, and it will fire * between your sides with the separation arrow Sayyed Salim was courageous and did not fear the enemy at times of conflict, and Ibn Ruzaiq mentions the position of Sayyid Salim in his war with the Emir of Julfar Hassan bin Rahma Al Qassimi, who had five thousand soldiers in 24 ships, so Mr Saeed went out to them. Bin Sultan and his brother Sayyid Salim and the rest of Al Said who lived in Muscat on one boat, so a fierce war fell into the sea between them, and then four ships were assigned to them from Muscat, and a total of 1,200 soldiers were in it.

Early life Parker was born in 1714 in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. When he was eleven-years-old, his father died. Parker apprenticed himself on a servant indenture on January 1, 1727 for eight years to William Bradford, the colonial printer in New York City. The agreement terms were that Bradford was to feed and provide for Parker in exchange for labor the boy would do. Bradford was also to train Parker the skills of the printing trade. Parker became a liability instead of an asset for Bradford when there was little printing work available. He decided in April 1733 to sell the remaining 21 months left on Parker's servant indenture and advertised the sale of his indenture. Parker ran away on May 17 before Bradford had a chance to sell the remaining indenture. Parker became a \\"wanted man,\\" and Bradford advertised a reward for his capture in his New-York Gazette newspaper. The runaway ad described Parker as \\"an Apprentice lad....by trade a Printer, aged about 19 years; he is of a fresh Completion with short yellowish hair.\\" A reward was offered, which was doubled a short time later.  Mid-life  Parker ultimately went to Philadelphia and started working for Benjamin Franklin. He worked for Franklin as a journeyman. Franklin persuaded him to return to New York to fulfill his servant indenture agreement with Bradford. After completing his servant indenture agreement (with penalties), Parker returned to Philadelphia, where he lived with Franklin for several years. Franklin saw talent in Parker. In 1741, Franklin financed Parker, as a silent partner, in setting up his own printing business in New York City, with a six-year franchise agreement. Franklin provided printing equipment, a press, an assortment of types, and a third of the maintenance costs, in exchange for a share of the profits. Franklin saw this as an opportunity to take over the business monopoly of the aging seventy-seven-year-old Bradford in the Province of New York. Parker's new newspaper was called the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy. As the circulation grew, the paper gained a good share of Bradford's subscribers. Parker eventually became the official printer for both the King of England and the government of New York province. Sometime in the 1750s Parker decided to go back to Woodbridge to set up a print shop. At the time the colony of New Jersey had two capitals. The capital for what had historically been East Jersey was at Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the capital for West Jersey was at Burlington, New Jersey. When people from Perth Amboy needed to have printing jobs done, they went to New York City, but the people from Burlington went to Philadelphia, since that city was more convenient for them. Parker's new Woodbridge printing office was close to Perth Amboy, so he offered his printing services to those in the eastern part of New Jersey and western New York. Parker's Woodbridge printing office became the first permanent print shop in New Jersey.  Interests  Parker had a variety of civic and community interests. He was a captain of a troop of horse guards in Woodbridge, a church member lay reader, comptroller of the general post- offices of the British colonies and postmaster with John Holt. He also became judge of the court of common pleas of Middlesex County, New Jersey. Parker was in journalism in the colonies of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. He had several printing businesses in his lifetime. Parker not only published newspapers and official government documents, but also published magazines, poetry, fiction, history, science, almanacs, and religious material. He was also a printer for Yale College in Connecticut in the mid-eighteenth century.  Religion  Parker was Episcopalian although he was buried near his parents in the First Presbyterian churchyard in Woodbridge.  Works  Works attributed to Parker as the printer are: File:Colden's 1746 Gravity book.jpgCadwallader Coldenbook on gravity of 1746 File:Votes & Proceedings of the General Assembly 1754.jpgVotes and Proceedings of the General Assembly... 1754 File:An act to restrain the sending of provisions to Cape- Breton.jpgAn act to restrain the sending of provisions to Cape-Breton... 1755 File:Letter to a Gentleman in NYC 1759.jpgLetter to a Gentleman in the city of New York 1759 File:One Shilling note 1763.jpgOne Shilling note of 1763 File:One Shilling Bill 1763.jpgOne Shilling Bill of 1763 File:Conductor General 1764.jpgConductor Generalis 1764 File:An humble Address to the Publick 1766.jpgAn humble Address to the Publick 1766 * The Votes and Proceedings of the General Assembly of the Province of New Jersey (April 17, 1754 ‚Äì June 21, 1754) * Independent Reflector (1752‚Äì3), edited by William Livingston * Occasional Reverberator (1753), four issues * John Englishman (1755), ten issues April 9 to July 5 * Instructor (1755), ten issues March 6 to May 8 * New American Magazine (1758‚Äì60), edited by Samuel Nevill * History of New Jersey (1765), written by Judge Samuel Smith  Later life and death  Parker took over Bradford's position as the official government \\"public printer\\" for New York on December 1, 1743. He was the government \\"public printer\\" for New Jersey in 1758. Parker had several controversial issues during the tenure as the government \\"public printer\\" of New York and New Jersey. His clients included many of New York City's elite. Parker even acted as Franklin's agent in the business of Franklin & Hall when Franklin went to Europe. Parker's New York printing business was handed down to his nephew Samuel Parker in February 1759. This business was ultimately taken over by Holt in 1760. Holt was the manager of the Connecticut Gazette that Parker started as the first newspaper in that colony. In 1770, Parker printed a controversial paper by Sons of Liberty leader Alexander McDougall for which he was arrested, however he died shortly thereafter before the settling of the case. Parker suffered many years from gout and died at a friend's house in Burlington, New Jersey, July 2, 1770. Towards the end of Parker's life, many of his business partners took advantage of his poor health and directed most of the profits of the business into their own pockets without sharing with Parker as they should have. Holt's obituary in the New York Journal (July 5, 1770) says that Parker \\"was eminent in his Profession\\", \\"possessed a sound judgment and extensive knowledge\\", \\"was industrious in Business, upright in his Dealings, charitable to the distressed.\\" Holt stated his one time business partner \\"left a fair Character.\\" Parker's will showed that he bequeathed his three printing press businesses (Burlington, New Haven, Woodbridge) to his son.  Legacy  In his day Parker was considered a better printer than William Bradford or Benjamin Franklin in the American Thirteen Colonies. He was the general manager of the first public library in New York city. Parker established the first newspaper in the colony of Connecticut, the Connecticut Gazette (April 12, 1755). He also founded the Constitutional Courant, the first newspaper in New Jersey.

At age 11, after having also lived in Argentina, he arrived to Chile. Franz studied law at the Universidad de Chile (1976-1981) and became a member of the Chilean Bar in 1983, a career that he abandoned four years later so as to dedicate himself to literature. Between 1981 and 1983 he attended the literary workshop of Jos√© Donoso. Franz has written the novels Santiago Cero (1988); El lugar donde estuvo el Para√≠so (1996); El desierto (2005); Almuerzo de vampiros (2007); and Si te vieras con mis ojos (2015).

Life The son of Thomas Needler, of Laleham, Middlesex, he was born on 29 November 1620. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 11 September 1634, and was elected to St John's College, Oxford, on 11 June 1642, matriculating on 1 July. He was elected fellow of his college in 1645, but appears to have been non-resident, as his submission is not registered. Joining the presbyterian party, he was summoned to assist the parliamentary visitors of the university in 1648, and was by them created B.C.L. on 14 April of the same year. On 8 August he was appointed to the rectory of St. Margaret Moses, Friday Street, London. It is not known whether he was ordained into episcopal orders or not. He was one of the ministers in London who in January 1648‚Äì9 signed the Serious and Faithful Representation to General Thomas Fairfax, petitioning for the life of King Charles I and the maintenance of parliament. In August 1662 Needler was ejected from his rectory by the Act of Uniformity. He went to North Warnborough in Hampshire, where he preached privately till the time of his death. He was buried at Odiham, near Winchfield, on 20 October 1682. Works Needler published Expository Notes with Practical Observations towards the opening of the five first Chapters of Genesis, London, 1655, and three sermons which are reprinted in editions of Morning Exercises (cf. those of 1660, 1661, 1675, 1676, 1677, and 1844). He also wrote some verses on the death of Jeremiah Whitaker, published in Simon Ashe's funeral sermon on Whitaker, Living Loves between Christ and Dying Christians, London, 1654. Family On his marriage in 1651 with Marie, sister of Nathanael Culverwell, Needler resigned his fellowship at St. John's College.

They were delivered by Henschel with numbers in the range from 11 to 20 on their cabside number plates, but were renumbered in the range from 21 to 30 by the railway, possibly since the fifteen Jung locomotives were already numbered in the range from 1 to 15.

They used Allan valve gear. Their \\"Ha\\" class designation identified the locomotive type as the first class to have been built for GSWA by Henschel. One of these locomotives, no. 27, and possibly more were rebuilt in the Usakos Workshop for use on the Otavi Railway's fast passenger service by removing the side-tanks and coal bunker and coupling it to a tender. Similar modifications were done on two of the Jung locomotives.R√∂hr, Gustav F. (1980). Die Feldspurbahnen S√ºdwestafrikas 1000km auf 600mm Spur.

Service During the First World War, the former German colony came under South African administration and the railways in GSWA came under control of the Union Defence Forces. Control of all railway operations in South West Africa (SWA) was passed on from the Military to the Director of Railways in Windhoek on 1 August 1915. On 1 April 1922, all the railway lines and rolling stock in the territory became part of the South African Railways (SAR). Only one of these locomotives, no. 22, survived the First World War into the SAR era. It retained its German Colonial Ha class designation and engine number in SAR service. Other locomotive types At least two other locomotive types also served on the Otavi Railway, but information about them is sketchy. Even though they are reputed to have been built by Henschel, they do not appear in the Henschel works list. * In 1903, a small side-tank engine with a four-wheeled tender was supplied.

The construct relies on a distinction between the personal self and the social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make someone a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective. The potency of the personal self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as ‚Äúgroup identification‚Äù. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.  Theoretical foundations  The identity fusion construct builds upon earlier work by emphasizing aspects of the relationship of people to groups that were de- emphasized within the social identity perspective (i.e., social identity theory and self-categorization theory). Like social identity theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities. However, the social identity approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in the salience and influence of one identity diminishes the salience and influence of the other. One important implication of this assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously. Pictorial Scale Measure of Identity Fusion. Individuals who are \\"fused\\" with their group would select option 'E' Social identity theory also suggests that group members are only linked to one another through their allegiance to the collective; theoretically, personal relationships between group members do not foster identification with the group (with the exception of one study). In contrast, fused individuals feel deeply connected to other group members as individuals, as well as to the larger group as a whole. This is reflected in measures of identify fusion. For example, the verbal measure of identity fusion taps feelings of reciprocal strength between the individual and the group (e.g., \\"I am strong because of my group\\"; \\"I would do more for my group than any other group members would do\\") as well as feelings of oneness with the group (e.g., \\"I am one with my group\\"; \\"My group is me\\").  The four principles  The characteristics of identity fusion theory have been summarized in the form of four principles: # Agentic-personal self principle: When identity-fused individuals become strongly aligned with a group, they are assumed to maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent with this idea, activating the personal self by increasing physiological arousal, or encouraging people to think about how they would react if they were personally threatened, may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, this was not the case for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect. # Identity synergy principle: The fact that the personal and social selves can be activated independently raises the possibility that they may combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, studies have shown that the activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by ostracizing participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their group membership, resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and these two types of self- knowledge may sometimes work together. # Relational ties principle: The fusion approach assumes that strongly fused persons care not only about their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) with other members of the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom they may have had little or no contact. Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their ‚Äúcollective ties‚Äù toward the group). # Irrevocability principle: The fusion approach assumes that, once developed, fusion will remain largely stable over time. This stability persists even in varying situations. Identity fusion theory proposes that this is due to the strong emotions, beliefs, and intra-relationships experienced by the strongly fused individuals. That is, although the overall fusion of a group of persons may shift in response to powerful situational forces, the rank orderings of individuals within the group will remain stable. Researchers have tested the ‚Äúonce fused, always fused‚Äù hypothesis by comparing the temporal stability of fusion-with-country scores for highly fused individuals with those of moderately or weakly fused individuals. The stability coefficients for highly fused participants were significantly higher than the coefficients associated with weakly or moderately fused participants. Even when ostracized strongly fused individuals will go to serious lengths to reaffirm their steadfastness to the group.  Consequences  = Endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors = Since the experimental study of actual extreme pro-group acts raises large ethical red flags, researchers have largely focused on endorsements of extreme pro-group acts. Several studies have shown that fusion is a robust predictor of willingness to fight and die on behalf of one‚Äôs group. Other research has examined responses to variations of the trolley dilemma adapted for groups. In scenarios that pitted the desire for self- preservation against self-sacrifice for others, strongly fused persons were especially willing to endorse sacrificing their lives for fellow in-group members (but not for out-group members). Using a different approach, researchers examined group members‚Äô reactions to significant group losses and found that highly identified individuals tend to detach themselves from the group following a group failure, whereas strongly fused persons predicted that they would ‚Äúgo down with the ship‚Äù. For example, in parallel studies of the 2008 presidential elections in Spain and the United States, people who were strongly fused with their political party internalized both victory and defeat, but highly identified persons internalized only victory. Additional field research with terrorist groups like ISIS and rebel groups is also beginning to shed light on the role identity fusion plays in extreme pro-group behaviors. = Engagement in personally costly, pro-group behaviors = In addition to predicting endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors, research suggests that fusion is a predictor of a variety of personally costly pro- group behaviors in the real world. In a study of transsexuals considering sex reassignment surgery, individuals strongly fused with their desired sex underwent surgical procedures designed to permanently change their primary sex characteristics. Weakly fused participants were far less likely to undergo these procedures. Additional research has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other research has also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to go out of their way to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having ‚Äúblown the whistle‚Äù sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.  Local versus extended fusion  Since Charles Darwin, the willingness of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated members of the same large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still feel like they know them and even think of them as like family. In short, identity fusion theory posits that fused people project feelings of relational ties they have with known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of relational ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes willing to make sacrifices for members of large heterogeneous groups that most people would make only for small, tight- knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.  Mechanisms  = Shared essence = Although most fusion research to date has focused on the nature and consequences of fusion, recent research has revealed some starting points for understanding the causes of fusion. Perceptions of shared essence, the belief that one shares essential core qualities with the group, appears to be a key building block of identity fusion. Perceptions of shared essence arise in different ways in local and extended fusion. In local fusion, individuals have direct experiences with other group members that foster the conclusion that they share essential qualities with those individuals. In extended fusion, the perception of psychological kinship is fostered by the presence of certain characteristics that are perceived as fundamental to who the person is. For example, people are more likely to fuse with large extended groups when they become convinced that members of the group share with them genes or core values, especially if they hold those values sacred. = Invulnerability = The relational ties principle of fusion suggests that highly fused individuals will feel that they and other group members synergistically strengthen each other. This perception of reciprocal strength should foster the perception that together, members of the group are uniquely invulnerable. These feelings of invulnerability may serve to insulate strongly fused individuals from fully recognizing the risks associated with extreme acts. Perceptions of invulnerability have been shown to mediate the effects of fusion on endorsement of pro-group behavior. = Agency = The identity synergy principle of fusion assumes that the borders between the personal and social selves are highly permeable for strongly fused individuals. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that strongly fused individuals will channel their feelings of personal agency into pro-group behavior. Perceptions of agency have been shown to mediate the effect of fusion on pro-group behavior. = Shared experience = A study found that groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral bonding, and pro-group behavior.

As a result, The Norfolk Mutual Fire Insurance Company was established by a group of prominent citizens, electing John Endicott as the company's first president. In 1847, it built an office building at 4 Pearl Street in Dedham Square. For the next 40 years, the building also housed the Dedham Institution for Savings. The company quickly grew and evolved with the industry and expanded to various states in the Northeast. The growing complexity of American property and casualty insurance brought new coverages, new protocol for storms, and new product enhancements. Some of these enhancements included the first comprehensive insurance packages, the forerunners of today's common Homeowners and Businessowners Policies. In the 1950s, doing business in 26 states, the group constructed its current headquarters building along the Charles River. N&D; eventually retrenched on its core business and now focuses on general P&C; insurance in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and farmowners policies in Arkansas.

The ruins are near Ilchester and Bonnie Branch roads. The upper college building was built in 1868 consisting of a cupola topped eighteen bay by five bay building with a five by five bay projection. A three by three bay, five story \\"L\\" shaped addition is included, with all of the structure on a stone foundation. A three-story chapel was attached to the building in 1882. In 1934 a fifth floor was added throughout. A statue of Madonna with Child was situated in a niche. History The college was situated on the land of the former Ellicott brothers hotel and a tavern, adjacent to a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station along the Patapsco River. The site was anchored by a twin of the Savage, Maryland Bollman Truss Iron Railroad Bridge built in 1869; the bridge was replaced in 1900. In 1866, after years of neglect, the buildings and site were sold by George Ellicott to the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists) for $15,000. Mount St. Clemons College was built in 1868 and the studentate moved from Annapolis. In 1872 the juventate settled into the expanded lower house (the former Ellicott Tavern); however, it relocated to Pennsylvania in 1881. The name was changed to St. Mary's College in 1882. A student would spend six years at the college before ordination as a priest. In 1893 a congregation named Our Lady of Perpetual Help was formed to assist poor in the area, and it still exists. The novitiate moved from Annapolis, to be situated at the Ilchester site from 1907 to 1972. In 1907 the studentate moved from Ilchester to New York. The Ellicott hotel became the lower house of the college; it was destroyed by fire on 14 June 1968. In 1972 the Redemptorists shut down the college, with only 10 students in its graduating class. The Novitate was moved to Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where it was combined with another Novitiate. In 1982 Micheal Nibali, a developer, purchased a portion of the site for $250,000 including the college building, with the intent of converting the building into 96 apartments. Nibali had won a controversial bid from executive J. Hugh Nichols to convert the a recently burned Ellicott City Elementary school to apartments. After approval failed, the building was abandoned and allowed to be vandalized. During this time, residents and media gave the college building the moniker, \\"Hell House\\". In 1987 the Maryland Department of Natural Resources acquired a portion of the site and annexed the land to Patapsco Valley State Park. The Kamakoti & Tirupati Foundation had previously leased the site launched an effort to purchase it. However, in 1988 the site was purchased by Sateesh Kumar Singh of BCS Limited Partnership for $400,000. A caretaker, Alan Rufus Hudson defended the property from vandals with repeated arrests for assault. On Halloween night, 1997, the building was burned by arsonists. The caretaker's building was condemned shortly afterward. The building was completely demolished in 2006. The college was one of many historical buildings in the region with valuable real estate that was lost to arson, including The Volkmann Manor (1965), Troy Hill (1990), Avondale Mill (1991), Ammendale Normal Institute (1998), Phelps Log Cabin - Moved from North Laurel to Elkridge (2001), Thistle Manufacturing Company, located directly across the river from St. Mary's (2003), and Henryton State Hospital (2007 and 2011) References Universities and colleges in Howard County, Maryland Demolished buildings and structures in Maryland Buildings and structures demolished in 2006 ","title":"St. Mary's College (Ilchester)"},{"id":"41131289","text":"Ammophila urnaria is a species of hunting wasp in the family Sphecidae. It is a black and red insect native to the eastern United States. It feeds on nectar but catches and paralyses caterpillars to leave in underground chambers for its developing larvae to consume. Description Ammophila urnaria is a small wasp about long with a slender body. It is black apart from a band of red around the front portion of its abdomen. Distribution Ammophila urnaria is native to the eastern part of North America in locations including Nova Scotia, South Carolina and St John's Bluff in eastern Florida. Behaviour Ammophila urnaria feeds on nectar and can often be seen on the flower heads of sorrel or onion. The breeding season is in summer. The female wasp digs a succession of burrows in sandy soil, provisioning each burrow with one or more paralysed caterpillars, lays an egg on the first caterpillar in each and seals the hole. The caterpillars in each burrow should provide sufficient nourishment to allow the larva that hatches from the egg to grow and pupate. Some wasps are kleptoparasites. They may open the nests of other A. urnaria wasps, remove their eggs and lay their own on the caterpillars stored there. Some have also been observed to parasitise the nest burrows of other species of wasp, Ammophila kennedyi and Podalonia robusta. George and Elizabeth Peckham were American ethologists and entomologists and described in 1898 how they watched a female A. urnaria wasp provisioning her burrow. She ran along the ground among purslane plants until she found a small green caterpillar which she paralysed with a sting. She carried this heavy burden through their garden and out into an adjoining field of maize. Although all the cornstalks look similar to the Peckhams, the wasp quickly located the right spot and laid the caterpillar down. She then moved two fragments of soil which had been concealing the entrance to a hole. Picking up the caterpillar, she reversed into the burrow dragging the caterpillar behind her and disappeared from view. They could not see what happened next but knew she was laying an egg beside the caterpillar. They later observed another A. urnaria wasp knock a caterpillar off a bean plant onto bare ground. The caterpillar writhed and struggled to escape, rolling and unrolling itself, and the wasp had difficulty getting hold of it. She eventually straddled it, grasped it with her mandibles, lifted it off the ground and curled her abdomen underneath. It continued to struggle but she managed to insert her sting into the junction between the third and fourth segments. At once the caterpillar became motionless and limp and she was able to sting it twice more, choosing the underside junctions between segment two and three and then between segments one and two. After a brief pause and circling flight she stung it again several times in joints in the posterior part of its body. On another occasion they saw a female wasp hammering the ground firm over the entrance to a burrow with a small pebble and reported what they thought was the first observation of an insect using a tool. They were unable to observe this behaviour again but later discovered that Samuel Wendell Williston had recorded similar behaviour in the wasp Ammophila yarrowi in 1892. Since then, several species of Ammophila have been observed to move dry soil, particles of grit, male pine cones and other suitable size fragments into their burrows, push these objects down with their heads, add more, pound the surface of the ground with chips of wood or fine pebbles and leave it smooth and level. The fact that these other wasp species also use tools makes it likely that this behaviour evolved a long time ago in a common ancestor.

The website was founded in 2013 by David Kalt shortly after he purchased music instrument store Chicago Music Exchange and became frustrated with then- available options for buying and selling guitars online. It has grown into a multimillion-dollar business with more than 10 million monthly visitors and $47 million in funding. The website allows anyone to create free listings for musical instruments and other related equipment. The site also has sold gear from popular artists such as Maroon 5, Wilco, Green Day, Billy Corgan, and Ray Lamontagne. The site has roughly half a million listings of music-related gear. To help users determine market values for instruments, Reverb.com provides a price guide of real-time transactional data. The company offers iPhone and Android apps, which include the site's main features, and as of 2017 has on-the-ground support in the UK, The Netherlands, Australia, Germany, France, and Japan. In late 2017, the company launched Reverb LP, an online marketplace for LPs and other physical music, and the Reverb Foundation, a non-profit supporting programs and initiatives that increase access to music education, gear, and opportunities to play. In August 2019, Reverb.com was acquired by Etsy for $275 million in cash. History David Kalt created Reverb shortly after purchasing a guitar store, Chicago Music Exchange. While working to find unique vintage guitars online for his shop and to sell gear online for extra revenue, he found that available options were cumbersome, expensive, and not tailored for musicians and the nuances that come with buying and selling music gear. Kalt still owns the Chicago Music Exchange, but has hired a CEO for the store so that he could focus his efforts on Reverb. =Funding= In November 2013, Reverb secured $2.3 million in funding from investors including Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, Lightbank co-founders Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, David Lowery of Cracker and Camper van Beethoven, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Eric Ries, and country music star Brad Paisley. The company raised another $4.2 million in January 2015 before announcing an additional $25 million led by global growth equity investor Summit Partners in December of the same year. In August 2017, the company announced another $15 million in funding from 65 investors, including PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Silicon Valley investor Roger McNamee, former Twitter COO Adam Bain, and Jon Oringer, CEO of Shutterstock, who said, ‚ÄúAs a regular user of Reverb.com, I am witnessing first-hand the positive impact that the company is having on musicians and the way instruments are bought and sold. I‚Äôm excited to support not only a successful marketplace‚Äîas that business model has proven itself powerful‚Äîbut a company that‚Äôs uplifting an entire industry.‚Äù Including seed funding, the latest round brings Reverb's total funding to $47 million. =Growth and international expansion= In August 2017, Reverb was named No. 18 on the Inc 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies, with 12,327 percent three-year growth (2013‚Äì2016.) In 2016, the company generated $16 million in revenue and supported $240 million in sales of new and used gear through its platform. As of December 2017, the company anticipated closing out the year with close to $400 million in sales.https://www.americaninno.com/chicago/inno-news-chicago/reverb-launches- its-online-vinyl-record-marketplace/ In August 2016, Reverb hired its first on-the-ground employees in the UK, France, and Australia.

As of 2017, the company has additional team members in Germany and Japan. = Acquisition by Etsy = On August 15, 2019, Etsy completed the acquisition of Reverb.com for $275 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments with respect to cash, working capital, transaction expenses, and the value of equity awards granted in connection with the transaction. Josh Silverman, Chief Executive Officer of Etsy, commented, \\"We are excited to officially welcome Reverb's employees and the entire Reverb community to Etsy. We see significant potential in the Reverb marketplace and look forward to supporting them as they enable more and more music lovers around the world to buy, sell, connect, and learn. It is our goal to unlock further value in what is already a strong and vibrant business with key competitive differentiation.\\" Business model Reverb charges a commission fee to the seller and a small percent for credit card processing. Kalt said, ‚ÄúWhen we started Reverb.com, musicians were getting 50¬¢ on the dollar when they sold something and paying 100¬¢ on the dollar when they bought something. By cutting fees and offering more information about comparable sales, we've narrowed that gap‚Äîand gotten millions more instruments on sale.\\" Another factor in the company's success is its live customer service team, and that roughly 85 percent of employees are musicians. Dave Depper, touring guitarist for Death Cab for Cutie, said, \\"My experience has been 100 percent positive. You can just tell it's run by people who are musicians or who care about musicians' experience.\\" Depper also cited the website's community feel as a positive, and that he is able to buy an instrument before a tour and sell it for about the same price after. The company also provides informative content such as demo videos and how-to articles to drive traffic to the website.
