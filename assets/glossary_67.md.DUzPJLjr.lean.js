Installed in 1899, it is an Italian marble statue portraying a single Confederate soldier atop a tall column and base. The Battle of Franklin took place here during the American Civil War, and was won by the Union. History =Dedication= The monument includes a 6 ft. 6 in.-tall Italian marble sculpture of a Confederate soldier shown at parade rest, on top of a tall column and base of granite and marble, which together are approximately 37 ft. 8 in. tall. The whole monument cost \\"nearly $2,700\\" to create in the late 1890s. It was dedicated by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy on November 30, 1899. Confederate General George Gordon attended the dedication, as did the widows and children of Brigadier General John Adams, and Tennessee Governor Benton McMillin. The flag of the 32nd Tennessee Infantry Regiment was raised; The Tennessean noted that it had not been flown in Franklin since 1861. Chapters of the UDC had developed across the South in the late 19th century, when the women were instrumental in getting Confederate cemeteries funded and organized, and in conducting the work of documenting and commemorating Confederate contributions. UDC members wrote memoirs and textbooks in addition to raising funds for monuments. =Restorations= The monument was restored by the City of Franklin at a cost of $750 in 1980. The city restored it again in 2010. At the time, Mayor John Schroer opined, \\"This is an important piece of the city of Franklin.\\" =Call for its removal= On August 17, 2017 a petition was circulated calling for its removal. Another petition to keep the monument was also started. Both petitions had thousands of signatures by late August. Eric Stuckey, Franklin's city administrator, said the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act prevented the city from removing the monument without the consent of the Tennessee Historical Commission. As of December 2018, the issue is in litigation.

It was projected and executed by Giacomo Della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi around the end of 16th century and the first years of 17th century. The building is protected by Italian Government and the distinctive feature of Palace consist in two buildings connected to each other but perfectly integrated that have generated the visual effect of the perspective on the Church of Santa Maria in Campitelli.  History  Palace Albertoni Facade (1620 ca.) The work was commissioned by Marquis Baldassarre Paluzzi Albertoni initially to Giacomo della Porta (1532-1602), then continued and completed by Girolamo Rainaldi (1570-1655), in an area between the buildings De Rossi (later Cavalletti) and Capizucchi. The work is the fruit of the work of the two great Renaissance architects who collaborated on several occasions and on various occasions through various papal commissions. In 1603, Knight Baldassarre Paluzzi Albertoni requested a permit to build the new facade, widening the area of the existing property towards the square and aligning the new wall with the corner of the adjacent Capizucchi palace. In 1616, he required an additional permit to construct, over the back door of his palace and over the alley, an archway to allow passage to his \\"nearest neighbors\\" (this is the archway built in the back, in the outside of the building, at the height of the first floor). So it is possible that the two buildings belonged to the same owner from the beginning, and then passed from one family to another. Moreover, it is plausible that the facade was created at another time – on an already existing renovated building – as witnessed by cartographers of the era: Cartaro, Du Peràc, and Tempesta, whose maps indicate already existing houses in that area. In addition, what also possibly indicates these two phases is the different alignment of the interior: it is orthogonal to the courtyard and to the sides of the adjacent palaces, but it is off-axis with respect to the front of the square. In fact, the entrance gallery of the building forms a diagonal connection between the square and the inner courtyard. Campitelli square (1660 ca) The presence of the Albertoni family is recorded in Campitelli square: the family's coat-of-arms, the lion passant is to be found on the old fountain (1587–89) as well as in the palace, above the entrance, over the lintels and niches along the stairs and in the frieze below the cornice of the main facade where we see lions passant with roe deer. Some of the minor palaces of the Paluzzi Albertoni family in Margana square, as well as under n. 36 of Via de' Delfini, were connected to the larger palace, both structurally and functionally. The heirs of the Paluzzi Albertoni family adopted on October 21, 1671 the surname and the arms of the Altieris together with the title of Princes by desire of Emilio Altieri (1590-1676) elevated to the Papacy in 1670 under the name of Clement X. Thus all the riches of the Altieris passed on to the descendants of the Paluzzi Albertoni family renamed as Altieri. In fact, the Palace of Piazza Campitelli turned out to be a less prestigious residence than the palace built by the Altieri al Gesù family which, together with the villa at the Lateran, was to host the works of art of the family. The Palace in Piazza Campitelli, remaining at the hands of the renewed offspring of the Altieris for more than a century was elevated with a fourth floor on top of the attic, and was sold in 1808 approximately by Prince Paluzzo Altieri to the Spanish politician Manuel Godoy y Alvares de Faria Ríos Sánchez Zarzosa, Prince of the Peace, (1767-1851). Somewhat later, the building was handed over to Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca (1756-1844) who lived there from time to time at least from 1819. Upon Pacca's death, the palace of Piazza Campitelli belonged to his grandchildren for about fifty years, who rented parts of it out to their acquaintances, including Cardinals Giacomo Piccolomini and Giacomo Antonelli. Subsequently, in 1886 the building was sold by the descendants of Pacca to Countess Carolina Portalupi (1852-1891), who restored it, leaving it to her direct descendants, the Genoese Marquis Spinola [Maria Antonietta Spinola was later to marry the well-known politician Mario Cingolani (1883- 1971), while Bonifacio Spinola married his second cousin, Countess Marina Baldeschi (1895-1983)]. The restoration of the Palace could not be postponed further since the complex was in a poor state of repair as a result of years of neglect: the works concerned mainly parts of the courtyard, the stairs, and the interiors. Walls were consolidated; arches, vaulted ceilings, and floors were reinforced or rebuilt; the eaves, roofs and terraces were repaired; the stairs and the floors of the landings of the main staircase were completely renewed; and many ceilings were renovated – especially the decorated ones – as were the upholstery of the interior walls, with doors and windows. There are also some interventions documented in relation to a more proper distribution of water and the renovation of the bathrooms. This period also witnessed the construction of the new glass-covered gallery on the south- east, and probably the cant of the third floor towards Palazzo Cavalletti. The work was substantial, but left the structure of the building unchanged. In 2006 and 2007 some conservative restoration work was carried out and the Palace is now in so good conditions that deserves this kind of masterpiece.  Features and description  The connection between the two bodies of the building (view from Capizzuchi square) The floor plan of the building: the two bodies(Palazzo and Palazzetto) and the \\"secret\\" roof garden connected by the overbridge Giacomo Della Porta worked on the construction of the building by acting on the load-bearing structures and internal partitions from last years of 1500 until his death in 1602, after which Girolamo Rainaldi, who from 1592 collaborated with the Maestro.,Cristiano Marchegiani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Enciclopedia Treccani, Volume, 86, 2016, Roma) \\"….

This creates the millimeter perspective obtained from the entrance door of the Palazzetto through the orthogonality of the entrance gallery with the facade of the palace overlying to the existing buildings already present at least since 1593 as the cartography of the time shows.Cartografie di Antonio Tempesta (1593); per un accurato resoconto sulla storia dell'evoluzione urbanistica della piazza confronta Joseph Connors, Alliance and Enmity in Roman Baroque Urbanism, 3, Roma, Bibliotheca Hertziana,1989, pp. 245-260. The integration of the two buildings is allowed by the position of the openings of the rear part of the Palazzo Grande, which are aligned with those of the Palazzetto behind and not modified by the façade works started in 1603. As can be seen from the licenses obtained by the owners respectively 1603 and 1616, the first to redo the aforementioned façade of the palace on Piazza Campitelli,Giovanni Battista Falda, Nuovi disegni dell'architettura, e piante de' Palazzi di Roma de' più celebri architetti, II, Roma ,Archivio di Stato di Roma,1655-1670; Howard Hibbard, Di alcune licenze rilasciate dai mastri di strade per opere di edificazione a Roma (1586-'89, 1602-'34), Roma, Bollettino d'Arte, Roma, 1967 (p. 100, p. 104, n° 29, p. 109 , n° 83, figg. 37 e 43.). Howard Hibbard, art. cit. , p. 104, tomo 83, anni 1602 - 1606, n° 29, c. 62, 1 marzo 1603: «Concediamo licentia all'Ill. mosignor Baldassare Palutij de Albertoni che possi edificare di novo la facciata del suo palazzo posto vicino a tor de specchi confinato da una banda con il palazzo delli SS.ri Capozucchi et dall'altra con li SS.ri de Rossi et tirando per linea retta fin'al muro delli SS.ri Capozucchi qual filo piglia nel sito di detto poggiolo canna l'una e palmi 41 et detractone palmi 23 che detto signor Baldassare da a detto poggiolo resta tutto quello che si concede al detto signor Baldassarre canna 1 e palmi 18 conforme alla presente pianta ... ». the second to build the overpass connecting the two properties,Howard Hibbard, Di alcune licenze rilasciate dai mastri di strade per opere di edificazione a Roma (1586-'89, 1602-'34), Roma, Bollettino d'Arte (art. cit.), pp. 100 e 109, tomo 85 (1613-1616), n° 83 (c. 161 v) 30 maggio 1616, \\"Essendosi viva voce resoluto , et decretato ... che si concedi licenza al signor Cavaliere Baldassare Paluzzi Albertoni di poter fare sopra la porta di dietro della sua Casa un arco, che passi sopra il vicolo per pocer'andare all'altre sue Case vicine, dove al presente fabbrica ...\\". Il passaggio ad arco in questione si imposta all'esterno del palazzo, all'altezza del primo piano, in corrispondenza del retro del muro con il tondo con il calco della testa di Cesare ed e' desinente in un corpo di fabbrica affacciato su di un giardino pensile tra via de' Delfini, piazza Margana e piazza Capizucchi. these did not provide for other demolition and reconstruction works of the structures. Even the hanging garden is aligned with the flyover doors both towards the first floor landing of the Palazzo Grande and towards the first floor of the Palazzetto. The façade and the external decorations of the Palazzo Grande are by Rainaldi with an exquisitely manneristic invention, while the immediate inheritance received by Della Porta provided for the general form of the compact and traditional constructionLuigi Callari, I palazzi di Roma e le case d'importanza storica e artistica, Roma, Ugo Sofia Moretti, 1944 (terza edizione., p. 437 s.v. «Palazzo Spinola»); Furio Fasolo, L'opera di Hieronimo e Carlo Rainaldi, Roma, Ricerche,1961( pagine 59, 65 e 339, nota 5 « ... anche alla immediata eredità del Della Porta si devono la sua (di Girolamo Rainaldi) partecipazione ... al Palazzo Paluzzi»; « ... del resto Hieronimo ... quando completa il Palazzo Paluzzi disponendo il lavoro di travertini per il portale si attiene al suo 'modo' e non a quello del palazzo in cui operava: come ho già avuto modo di dire, mentre la forma generale è compatta e tradizionale, è nell'invenzione squisitamente manieristica del dettaglio che egli instancabilmente opera ... »; « ... l'intervento di Hieronimo in Palazzo Paluzzi è evidente nell'accentuato decorativismo minuzioso del portale; meno evidente nel cornicione»); Giorgio Torselli, Palazzi di Roma, Milano, Ceschina,1965, (pagina 277 s.v. «Palazzo Spinola»); Vitaliano Tiberia, Giacomo della Porta, Roma, Bulzoni, 1974, (pagina 44); Daniela Gallavotti Cavallero, I Palazzi di Roma dal XIV al XX secolo, Roma, Quasar, 1989,(pagine 14-15, 249); Luigi Spezzaferro, Maria Elisa Tittoni, Il Campidoglio e Sisto V, Roma, Carte Segrete, 1991, (pagine 80-81); and generates the orthogonality of the internal entrance gallery. The subsequent construction of the overpass completes the integrative intentions derived from the astounding perspective of the Palazzetto, giving life over time, to an architectural masterpiece that could only emerge so perfect in the execution of the execution by the collaboration of two geniuses.  Special visual effects  The entrance gallery and the perspective(view from the Santa Maria in Campitelli Church Main door ) The \\"secret\\" roof garden The perspective vision that is obtained creates a sort of apparently inexplicable optical effect. In fact, moving backwards from the main entrance door of the Palace, the front entrance of the Church of Santa Maria in Campitelli begins to \\"move\\" from left to right until it coincides perfectly only when you reach the threshold of the door of the Palazzetto. It is necessary to underline that at the time of planning the facade of the current Church had not yet been built and that the birthplace of Blessed Ludovica Albertoni,Marina Minozzi, Rivista Roma Sacra, Elio De Rosa Editore, 1999, Roma; Parrocchia Santa Maria in Campitelli, I disegni di Carlo Rainaldi, Archivio Parrocchiale Santa Maria in Campitelli, Roma, 2017 the true spiritual authority of the family, was located on the same site. The Paluzzi Albertoni had therefore probably wanted to keep the view from door to door to keep a constant memory of the Blessed. A part of the perimeter wall of the house of the Blessed is still visible with an ancient fresco inside the Chapel of the Albertoni family in Santa Maria in Campitelli.Francesco Ferraironi, Santa Maria in Campitelli, Roma, Casa Editrice Roma, 1933; Maria Pedroli Bertoni, Santa Maria in Campitelli, Istituto nazionale di Studi Romani, Roma, 1987. Another effect produced is the loss of \\"orientation\\" within the two buildings: in fact, visiting the rooms from the inside, it is not fully realized if its position is in the large body of the Palace or in the other smaller, so called Palazzetto. A further visual peculiarity is that concerning the \\"secret\\" hanging garden, visible from the entrance of the flyover to the first floor of the Palazzo grande, although it is \\"hidden\\", as a rear offshoot of the first floor of the Palazzetto and therefore far from the square.  Other sculptures in the Palace  Head of a priest of Isis reworked as \\"Publius Scipio Africanus\\" In the Palace there is still a small collection of six portrayed heads – one in the entrance hall past the courtyard and the other five over the stairs – which were part of the collection of the Albertoni Paluzzi family, collectors of ancient artwork. The Paluzzi Albertoni collection was merged in the 1600s with the remarkable Altieri collection, enriching the family mansion and other properties including villas on the Esquilino and at Porta Salaria. The busts to be found today in the Albertoni Spinola palace are \\"two ancient marble heads – one of a young woman and one of Antinous – mended in part; another ancient marble head – a priest of Isis – reworked in the Renaissance era as a portrait of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus; two marble portraits reconstructed during the Renaissance era – one of Julius Caesar and another probably of Hesiod or Zeno of Elea – and a plaster cast of the head of Julius Caesar (probably of the Pacca and not of the Paluzzi family) taken from the statue preserved in the Senatorial Palace on the Capitoline HillGiandomenico Spinola, Le sculture nel palazzo Albertoni Spinola a Roma e le collezioni Palazzi ed Altieri, Rome, Giorgio Bretshneider, 1995.

He was ordinary consul for 126 as the colleague of Marcus Annius Verus; Lucius Valerius Propinquus replaced Verus by 1 March and was his colleague for the remainder of the first nundinium of that year.Werner Eck, \\"Hadrische Konsuln Neue Zeugnisse aus Militärdiplomen\\", Chiron, 32 (2002), p. 482 Ambibulus is known only through inscriptions. An inscription from Aeclanum, a town of Campania, which the decurions of that town erected to honor Ambibulus as their patron, preserves his full name, an example of polyonymy: Gaius Eggius Ambibulus Pomponius Longinus Cassianus Lucius Maecius Postumus. The third element in his name, \\"Ambibulus\\", is a cognomen Ronald Syme describes as \\"peculiar and uncommon\\"; he could only count five examples of its use in inscriptions found at Rome, and one more in North Africa.Syme, \\"Three Ambivii\\", Classical Quarterly, 36, No (1986) p. 275 Obviously the fourth and fifth elements in his name come from his mother. Edmund Groag suggested that the last three elements in his name may be due to a testamentary adoption by the suffect consul of the year 98, Lucius Maecius Postumus.Groag, \\"Eggius (2)\\", Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, V-1, col. 1986 In his study of the politics following the death of Domitian, John D. Grainger describes Postumus as one of \\"the usual aristocratic drones\\".Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96-99 (London: Routledge, 2003), p. 101 The origins of \\"Cassianus\\" in Ambibulus' name are unknown. Ambibulus' origins are in Aeclanum. Two tombstones erected by Ambibulus provide details of his mother's family. One honors his mother's brother, Marcus Pomponius Bassulus Longinianus; the other honors his maternal grandfather, Marcus Pomponius Bassulus, and includes a somber funeral poem. From these inscriptions we can infer his mother's name was Pomponia Longina, and his father's also Eggius Ambibulus.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 76 An inscription from Pisidian Antioch offers the name Eggia C.f. Ambibula, the wife of Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, governor of Cappadocia; she might be Ambibulus' sister or cousin.  Career  The inscription the decurions of Aeclanum erected provides details of his cursus honorum about as far as his consulate. He began as one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards of the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Serving as one of these minor magistracies was considered an important first step in a senator's career. Next Ambibulus was commissioned as a military tribune of Legio XI Claudia, which was stationed at several points on the Danubian frontier during the possible dates Ambibulus was assigned to this legion. The inscription records he was sevir equitum Romanorum of the annual review of the equites at Rome, then he was adlected inter patricios -- into the patrician order. The reason for Ambibulus' admission to this highest stratum of Roman society is unknown, but it is only the first instance of favor shown to him by the emperor Trajan. Ambibulus was appointed quaestor to the emperor Trajan; to hold this magistracy in connection with the emperor was a very prestigious honor. After serving as legatus or assistant to the governor of Macedonia, as a patrician Ambibulus was excused from the next Republican magistracy and was the emperor's candidate for praetor. At this point he gained acceptance into two Roman priesthoods, the salii Collini and flamines Claudiales, before acceding to the consulate. His life after the consulate is a blank. Since Ambibulus had such a promising career to that point, it is tempting to suggest he may have died within a few years of stepping down from his last known office.

Guidotti tended to the ill in several hospitals across Zimbabwe and was even noted for taking care of Robert Mugabe's mother on one occasion. Her work saw hospitals expand to treat a greater number of patients and her work was appreciated nationwide which in part led to charges against her being dropped after she was accused of treating a guerilla which she had in fact done. Her beatification process opened in 1995 in Modena. Life Luisa Guidotti Mistrali was born in mid-1932 in Parma as the first of three children to Camillo Guidotti and Anna Mistrali. Her mother was a baroness from Parma and her father's side owned the Fabbrico castle in Reggio Emilia for four centuries. Her mother died from an incurable disease in 1947 and her father decided to relocate with his children to Modena where her maternal aunt Maria assumed care for the three children. Her education was spent in Modena and she received a religious formation from Catholic Action whom she grew close to around that time. In 1957 she had her first encounter with the Women's Medical Missions Association and later joined them as a consecrated member. Guidotti later enrolled in a medicine course and graduated in May 1960 in Parma. Her education then allowed her in 1962 to specialize in radiological treatment at the Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia in Rome where she graduated from on 12 December 1962. Guidotti fostered a strong devotion to Saint Thomas More and chose him as her spiritual guide. On 1 August 1966 she received the crucifix of the missionaries from the Archbishop of Modena Giuseppe Amici. Guidotti left for Chirundu on 9 August 1966 after having met with Pope Paul VI not long before that. Guidotti arrived in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) on 10 August and began working in a hospital in the north, close to Zambia. Guidotti returned to her homeland in July 1967 and on 12 September at the Benedictine convent in Metten in Germany became part of the Association in full. In February 1969 she moved to the Regina Coeli Mission Hospital on the Mozambique border, after having been working in a hospital in Salisbury since she first arrived in Africa. In December 1969 she joined the All Souls Mission north-east of the capital of Harare and later in 1975 returned to her homeland for another visit. On 24 June 1976 a guerilla named Antony Nodo was injured during fierce fighting and came to the hospital in need of urgent medical attention. Guidotti arranged for both a diagnosis and treatment for Nodo but was arrested for this on 28 June after the government alleged that she was aiding and abetting guerilla forces. The Red Cross leapt to her defense requesting her immediate release. Guidotti was acquitted of these charges on 24 August and returned to her hospital to work, acting as if the arrest never occurred. But her offering medical treatment to freedom fighters irritated the Rhodesian forces. She exercised due diligence so as to ensure she was not arrested and removed from her work once again. In 1978 she tended to the severe hypertensive crisis of Robert Mugabe's mother. Death During the evening on 6 July 1979 she set off in a black Sedan at 8 pm. A police unit had set up a roadblock on the main road about 100 metres beyond the turn-off to the All Souls Mission. When they observed a vehicle approaching which turned off before the roadblock, it was assumed to be absconding and a number of shots were fired, one of which struck Dr Guidotti, who was rushed to the Mtoko Hospital, but succumbed. An inquest was held and the matter referred to the Attorney-General. There was no evidence that Dr Guidotti was acting illegally other than driving after curfew. The Archbishop of Harare Patrick Fani Chakaipa celebrated her funeral Mass on 12 July though her remains were later relocated to the Modena Cathedral on 23 October 1988. In 1983 the All Souls' Mission Hospital became known as the Luisa Guidotti Hospital. Robert Mugabe unveiled a plaque dedicated to her at the hospital and was present with his mother whom Guidotti had treated back in 1978. Mugabe also related in his remarks how he had met with Guidotti once in 1974 and was left impressed with her and her work. Beatification process The beatification process opened in Modena after the forum for the diocesan process was transferred in 1995 from Harare to Modena. The official commencement for the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 21 April 1995 after she had been titled as a Servant of God and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared the nihil obstat to the cause meaning there were no objections for its initiation. The diocesan process was inaugurated in Modena at the cathedral on 20 October 1996 and concluded on 23 November 2013 in the same location. The current postulator for this cause is the Dominican priest Francesco Maria Ricci.

These were mostly village schools run by individual teachers (Ezhuthu Aashaans or Asans or Gurus) and were distinct from Kalaris that taught martial arts. Etymology The real meaning of Pallikkoodam is a sacred place for education. In medieval Kerala, Buddhist viharas were known as 'Palli. When Budha bhiskhus started small schools, they were called Pallikkoodam. A generally accepted explanation of the etymology of this Malayalam word is that it is a blend word formed out of two Malayalam words Palli and Koodam and that this originated from the centuries-old Buddhist practice. The word Palli usually denotes respect. Palliunarthal referring to respectable word to describe the morning awakening of a king. Pallurakkam, is another word which commence with the same sound \\"palli\\" respectable word to express a King's sleep. It is not known from when the word \\"palli\\" started using in the language though but it denotes the respect attached to the word. Malayalam word for \\"Church / Mosque\\" is also later referred to as \\"Palli\\". Wherever existed, Buddhists missionaries were active in spreading literacy and education across . The Buddhist monasteries, known as the Viharas were turned into educational institutes as the demand went high for Buddhist teachings, These were called ‘Palli’ in Kerala. Ezhuthupalli, that were run later near Hindu temples are considered to be school legacy of Viharas. The schools that were set up near to the temples were called as Ezhuthupalli. Even now the schools in Kerala are called as Pallikoodam in Malayalam. In Sri Lankan Tamil, too, the word Pallikkoodam is used. Also said that it is used by the Malankara Syrian Christian Church in Kerala to run a school along with (Malayalam word: കൂടെ, Transliteration: Koode) each and every major church (Malayalam word: പള്ളി, Transliteration: Palli) of the locality. Types There were different forms of Pallikoodams that were established across Kerala offering different levels of education, with some regional variations. Kudippallikoodam was by far the most important, popular and wide spread form, since most of the students except clerics, priests or scholarly professionals would usually stop after receiving elementary education and start working on their professions. =Kudippallikoodam= Kudippallikoodam (കുടിപ്പള്ളിക്കൂടം) also known as 'Aashan Pallikoodam' (ആശാൻ പള്ളിക്കൂടം) was a popular form of schooling. This was an indigenous elementary schooling method where an instructor or aashan (ആശാൻ) would teach young children about alphabets, numbers, elementary arithmetic, writing as well as generic aspects of life such as personal discipline, cleanliness, morality and general knowledge. Young students are initially trained on writing by making them write on sand. Once they are comfortable with writing on sand, the students would upgrade themselves to writing on the common writing medium i.e. palm leaves (Thaliyola or Palm-leaf manuscripts) as the writing material and iron pen (Narayam) as the writing instrument (stylus) to scribe on them. In the 20th century CE, the writing medium mostly got upgraded into wooden slates and chalk. This continued to be the casea until the system almost completely died out by the dawn of 21st century CE. Revival Efforts Some efforts have been undertaken in recent times to revive the traditional teaching methods and tools. A noteworthy example is the initiative titled Malayalam Pallikoodam that was proposed by the famous Malayalam Poet V Madhusoodanan Nair . This initiative tried to revive the use of wooden slates instead of paper notebooks and pencils for teaching Malayalam, and has received significant attention from parents.

It rises near Ahrweiler in the county of Ahrweiler in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Geography  = Location = The Häuschen is located in the Ahr Eifel in the Ahrweiler Forest (Ahrweiler Wald). Its summit rises about 4.5 km south- southwest of Ahrweiler, 3 km south of Walporzheim and 2.3 km northwest of Ramersbach, which are all subdistricts of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in the Ahr valley. It is 2.7 km southeast of the village of Rech, 4 km south-southeast of the village of Dernau and 2.7 km (each as the crow flies) north-northeast of the Kesseling village of Staffel. East of the hill rises the Wingsbach which is fed by the little Talbach and which flows northwards through the valley of Hungertal and empties into the River Ahr at Ahrweiler. To the northwest is the source of the Heckenbach, which is fed by the Beulsbach, runs north through the valley of Heckental and discharges into the Ahr at Walporzheim. To the south-southwest is the confluence of the Ahrbach and Sannerbach which forms the Ahlbach and then flows southwards before joining the Staffeler Bach (a tributary of the Kesselinger Bach). = Natural regions = The Häuschen lies within the natural region major unit group of the East Eifel (no. 27), in the major unit of the Ahr Eifel (272) and the subunit of the South Ahr Upland (Südliches Ahrbergland, 272.3), its northern flank being part of the lower subunit of the Middle Ahr Valley (Mittleres Ahrtal, 272.2) and in the natural room of the Recher Ahrengtal (272.21). = Height = The height of the Häuschen is 506.5 m but is sometimes rounded off to 505 m, which relates to the height given on the topographical map of 505.2 m, but is in fact a point about 45 metres east of the summit on a forest track. There is another spot height to the west-northwest of 498.8 m in the col between the Häuschen and its west-northwestern top (501.5 m).  Protected areas  On the Häuschen lies part of the protected landscape of the Rhine-Ahr Eifel (CDDA no. 323834; designated in 1980; 925.86 km²). Its western flank descends into the bird reserve of Ahrgebirge (VSG no. 5507-401; 304.23 ha).  Häuschen Tower  On 11 May 1908 an observation tower was erected on the Häuschen, the Häuschen Tower (Häuschen-Turm), which was 20 metres high. In the final phase of the Second World War (1939–1945) it housed a radio station of the Wehrmacht, and the wooden tower was burned down in spring 1945. On 30 September 1956 a new tower was inaugurated, of which only a few remains exist. From the viewing platform there was an all-round view of the Eifel including the Ahr Hills (Ahr Eifel), of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in the Ahr Valley and as far as the Siebengebirge and Westerwald.  Transport and walking  The B 267 runs past the Häuschen to the north through the Ahr valley. The L 84 runs past to the east from Ahrweiler to Ramersbach, and the L 85 southwest of Kesseling to Staffel and continues east-northeast through Ramersbach.

Bacon Corporation in an attempt to interest foreign air forces in an upgrade for their T-6 fleets. The aircraft did not receive sufficient interest for production, and only the single conversion was produced. History Produced in 1944 and operated by the United States Army Air Forces alongside its brethren, following the end of World War II AT-6F Texan 44-82028 was sold on the civilian market, operating in Iceland for a time before being acquired by Bacon for conversion. Described as appearing \\"like an illicit hangar affair between a T-33 and a T-6\\", the conversion consisted of adding the canopy, tip tanks, and tricycle landing gear from a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star; streamlining of the cowl and wings including jet stack exhaust, augmenter cooling, and a reduction in wingspan compared to the standard T-6; in addition, the cockpit was upgraded with a revised instrument panel and modernized avionics, and the aircraft's brakes were upgraded. Bacon hoped to sell the conversion to foreign air forces, many of which operated large fleets of T-6 aircraft; after taxi trials at the end of 1956, it first flew in April 1957, and flight testing was considered generally successful. No interest from its intended customers materialized and the aircraft was sold on the civilian market; it eventually received a paint scheme, believed to have been intended for a role in a movie, resembling that of a Russian fighter aircraft. It was stored at Whiteman Air Park in California, and allowed to deteriorate in the elements, with its registration being cancelled in 2013.

According to Herbert, Anne of Denmark obtained his portrait by William Larkin and Dorothy had it copied in miniature by Isaac Oliver, and she wore it in a gold locket concealed to view.James Lees-Milne, 'Two Portraits at Charlecote Park by William Larkin', The Burlington Magazine, vol. 94, No. 597 (Dec., 1952), pp. 352-6. Herbert said Dorothy was of \\"an excellent wit and discourse\\", but claimed he knew her only slightly. However, he also described visiting her chamber at the palace at night and finding her examining the miniature by candlelight. Soon, following a summons to court from a \\"great lady\\", Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, and Elizabeth, Lady Hoby, another of the queen's gentlewomen, all sent Herbert warning that Sir John Eyre planned to murder him in his bed. Herbert got in touch with Eyre to ask if he would fight a duel, but the answer was unclear. Eyre and four accomplices caught up with Herbert and his two footmen at Scotland Yard as he was leaving Whitehall Palace, and wounded his horse several times. Eyre broke Herbert's sword. Twenty more men appeared, Herbert thought them Eyre's supporters and attendants of the Earl of Suffolk. Two other men helped Herbert, and after a prolonged struggle he wounded Eyre, who was carried to the Thames vomiting. A few days later Eyre sent a message that he would kill Herbert with \\"a musket out of a window\\". Meanwhile, because Eyre claimed Dorothy had confessed to being unfaithful, she sent a letter to her aunt Lady Croke denying this, and Herbert was able to give this letter to the Privy Council. The Duke of Lennox said that John Eyre was \\"the most miserable man living\\" because of the shame of Dorothy's letter, and because his father had disinherited him on hearing of the assault.Horace Walpole, The life of Edward Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. Written by himself (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 134-149. He was appointed a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber by 1612, and received a gift of £500 from the king,John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1828), p. 440. serving to at least 1632. He was the member of Parliament for Cricklade in 1614, Calne in 1626, and Chippenham in 1628. He succeeded his father to Great Chalfield in 1629 but sold it two years later to Sir Richard Gurney, Lord Mayor of London, living afterwards in St. Giles-in-the-Fields, London. In April 1619 his younger brother fought a duel with Sir Henry Rich but neither were hurt.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 227. He was ambassador to Turkey in 1619–1621. He died in financially straightened circumstances in 1639, leaving just 5 shillings to his wife. Family John Eyre married, by 1610, Dorothy Bulstrode (1592-1650), the daughter of Edward Bulstrode of Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire, and Cecill Croke. Dorothy and her sister Cecily Boulstred (1584-1609) were both gentlewomen in the bedchamber of Anne of Denmark, and associated with Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. (Their grandmother Elizabeth Unton, Lady Croke had a connection to the Harington family.) The queen gave presents of clothing to her gentlewomen, and gave Dorothy, \\"Lady Eayres\\", a gown of ash-colour taffeta on 4 July 1610 and a black satin gown on 14 October 1610.Jemma Field, 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', Costume, 51:1 (March, 2017), p. 21, & supplement nos. 23, 333, 384. Another sister Anne Bulstrode (d. 1611) married the lawyer John Searle (1569-1622) in 1609, and their eldest sister Elizabeth (1575-1631) had married the lawyer James Whitelocke in 1602.John Bruce, Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6. Whitelocke recorded that Eyre and Bulstrode were married without the consent of either family, and wrote, \\"the man is one of the most dissolute, unjust, and vicious reprobates that lives upon the face of the earth\\". They had a son who predeceased John Eyre, born in October 1611 at Flambards at Cold Norton, Essex, the house of Dorothy's mother Cecill, now Lady Brown.John Bruce, Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 25-6. Dorothy Eyre later married John Clyffe (1597-1674). She died in 1650 and was buried at St Mary's, Upton Grey, Hampshire, where she has a marble or alabaster wall monument with her portrait bust and heraldry, and also a further wooden board with verses commemorating her.'Parishes: Upton Grey', in A History of the County of Hampshire, vol. 3, ed.

It runs north to south from Fulham Road to Cheyne Walk, and is bisected by the King's Road. History Bank Holiday, Corner of Beaufort Street, Chelsea, an 1889 etching by Théodore Roussel Beaufort Street is named after Sir Thomas More's home Beaufort House where he lived from 1520 to 1535; it was from Beaufort House that More was taken to the Tower of London, where he was executed. A Samuel Travers acquired Beaufort House in 1724 with the intention of opening it as a school, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Travers's executors subsequently sold the house to Hans Sloane, the owner of the manor of Chelsea, in 1737. The house was pulled down by Sloane in 1740 after having lain empty for 20 years. The former area of the Beaufort House estate became known as Beaufort Ground, encompassing an area from the King's Road to an open ground called Beaufort Green on the banks of the River Thames. The Beaufort Ground was leased for 91 years to the trustees of the Moravian congregation, an expatriate Protestant denomination, who had previously acquired the adjoining Lindsey House. The Moravian community under Nicolaus Zinzendorf created a burial ground and chapel on the site of the former stable yard of Beaufort House; this was reached by a passageway from the rear of Lindsay House. The community intended to start a Moravian settlement named Sharon on the rest of the Beaufort Ground, but were financially precluded from doing so by Zinzendorf's departure from England in 1755. The Beaufort Ground was subsequently leased as building plots by the 1770s. A 1781 inventory of the estate had measured it at 7 acres and the present Beaufort Street was laid down through the site. The only listed building on Beaufort Street is the chapel of Allen Hall Seminary, the Roman Catholic seminary of the Province of Westminster. It is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. The chapel was designed by 1958 by Hector Corfiato and is described in its Historic England heritage listing as demonstrating \\"a fine example of structural rationalism, dominated by a dramatic concrete-grid façade, and using the internal portal frame to fine dramatic and spatial effect\\". Allen Hall occupies a site that was bought in 1886 from George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan, by Kenelm Vaughan, the founder of the Brotherhood of Expiation. The first chapel on the site was converted from two artists studios that had been built in 1879 by the artist and architect William Burges for the painters Louise Jopling and her husband Joseph Middleton Jopling. The chapel of Allen Hall Seminary in June 2008 In her biography of Roger Fry, written in 1940, Virginia Woolf wrote that \\"Beaufort Street, whatever may have happened to the world since 1892, is practically unchanged.

Distractive markings serve to camouflage animals or military vehicles by drawing the observer's attention away from the object as a whole, such as noticing its outline. This delays recognition. The markings necessarily have high contrast and are thus in themselves conspicuous. The mechanism therefore relies, as does camouflage as a whole, on deceiving the cognition of the observer, not in blending with the background. Distractive markings were first noticed by the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer in 1909, but the mechanism was for a century confused with disruptive coloration, another mechanism for delaying recognition that also relies on conspicuous markings. Distractive markings however need to be small and to avoid outlines, to avoid drawing attention to them, whereas disruptive markings work best when they touch the outline, breaking it up. Distractive camouflage marks are sometimes called dazzle markings, but the mechanism differs from motion dazzle. History The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer described distractive markings in his 1909 book on camouflage, Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom. Thayer wrote that Mechanism Many prey animals have conspicuous high-contrast markings which paradoxically attract the predator's gaze, like other camouflage mechanisms, especially masquerade, working by exploiting weaknesses in the predator's cognitive mechanisms to delay detection or recognition of the prey. These distractive markings serve as camouflage by distracting the predator's attention from recognising the prey as a whole, for example by keeping the predator from identifying the prey's outline. Experimentally, search times for blue tits increased when artificial prey had distractive markings. The researchers, M. Dimitrova and colleagues, note that Thayer's suggestion that such marks take up the predator's attention is plausible, since visual attention is limited, and stimuli effectively compete for attention. They note, too, that bright features are preferentially given attention in human vision, so it is possible the same happens in other species. Another possible explanation according to Dimitrova is lateral masking, suppression of peripheral perception; this is known to be strong, again in human perception, when a (single) high-contrast stimulus is provided, but it is doubtful whether a pattern containing small distractive markings could form such a stimulus. Disruptive and distractive camouflage both rely on conspicuous markings, but differ in their mechanisms, and therefore in the most effective size and position of the markings. There is an apparent conflict between background matching and disruptive markings. Background matching relies on choosing coloration and brightness similar to the background, but disruptive markings must stand out from the background. Dimitrova and colleagues note that Thayer suggested that such markings must be small; this, they argue, would enable the markings to fit in with background matching at any great distance, and would prevent predators from learning a search image and then detecting prey with that type of marking. Hugh Cott, author of the 1940 Adaptive Coloration in Animals, followed by many other researchers, conflated distractive markings with disruptive coloration. Both mechanisms require conspicuous marks. However, the two mechanisms are different, and according to Dimitrova require different kinds of marking. For distraction, the markings should be small and should avoid the prey's outline so as to take attention away from it, whereas disruptive markings should contact the outline so as to break it up. Distractive camouflage marks are sometimes called dazzle markings, but the mechanism differs from motion dazzle, which relies on conspicuous markings to interfere with an observer's ability to estimate the target's speed and direction.

Made for ITV by Red Production Company, the series focuses on the family of an 11-year-old child Maxine (Callum Booth-Ford) who begins to realise that she is a transgender girl. Anna Friel and Emmett J. Scanlan play her parents, Vicky and Stephen, who reluctantly begin to accept Maxine's need to transition from male to female. The programme was also broadcast in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, and made available on the American subscription service Hulu. The series was created by Tony Marchant, who met transgender people and their families during the writing process through trans charity Mermaids. Critical reception was very positive, with reviewers praising the actors and scenes that they found particularly emotive. Further praise was given to the subject matter of the story, though this also received some criticism. The miniseries was well-received by social media users and several trans commentators, the first episode garnering 2.8 million overnight viewers. A scene in which Maxine attempts suicide was criticised by a gender clinic of the National Health Service.  Production  The programme was created and written by Tony Marchant, who had previously written Different for Girls, a 1996 film about an adult trans woman. In 1999, he worked on family- related programmes Kid in the Corner, about ADHD, and Bad Blood, about adoption. In an interview with HuffPost, Marchant said that an idea which he found appealing was \\"the fluidity of gender\\". The series' lead consultant was Susie Green, UK director of the charity Mermaids, which supports transgender youth. The storyline has similarities to Green's experiences with her transgender daughter Jackie, who in 2010 became the youngest British girl to receive sex reassignment surgery at age 16. Whilst writing the series, Marchant was able to visit families who Mermaids support and listen to their experiences. Marchant aimed to dispel two myths about transgender children: that they identify as such to be \\"trendy\\", and that puberty blockers are easy for trans people to access. Digital Spy reported that filming began in January 2018 and OK! reported that filming concluded in March 2018. Callum Booth-Ford, a cisgender boy, was cast as Maxine; around five actors were auditioned for the part. Marchant considered casting a trans child, but was told by Mermaids that it would be \\"really difficult and painful\\" for a trans actor. Green added that anonymity was a factor. ITV announced the miniseries in September 2017, along with the casting of Anna Friel of Maxine's mother Vicky. Emmett J. Scanlan was cast as Stephen, Maxine's father Scanlan read all three episodes' scripts in one sitting, finding it \\"so relevant and so well-written\\". He aimed to treat the subject with the \\"utmost honesty and care\\". Though saying she had little knowledge of transgender people prior to the project, Friel hoped to change public perception of transgender children, comparing it to her 1990s role on the soap opera Brookside where her character kissed another woman. Friel's daughter was aged thirteen during Butterflys production. Marchant noted a common theme among families at Mermaids was the presence of transgender children's mothers and absence of their fathers. Vicky's attitudes were written to be representative of her generation and Stephen's doubts were written to be reasonable and relatable. As research before filming began, Scanlan and Friel visited families that Mermaids work with. During filming, Friel listened to synth-pop and wore a specific perfume to get into the mindset of her character. The soundtrack, which consists of synth music, was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon, who previously worked together on Netflix's science fiction-horror series Stranger Things. It was released upon the miniseries' broadcast in America on the subscription service Hulu.  Cast  *Callum Booth-Ford as Maxine Duffy, birth name Max. Maxine is a trans girl who has wanted to wear girls' clothing since age five. Dysphoria with her body leads her to self-harm at age 11, and she wants nothing more than to stop her body developing into a male one. * Anna Friel as Vicky Duffy, Maxine's mother and guardian. Vicky has allowed Maxine to wear female clothing in the household but not in public; after consultation with professionals, she fully embraces Maxine's gender identity and works towards getting her treatment. * Emmett J. Scanlan as Stephen Duffy, Maxine's father. Stephen left the household after slapping Maxine for acting feminine in a moment of anger and he is reluctant to accept Maxine's identity. He returns home and is eventually able to support her. * Millie Gibson as Lily Duffy, Maxine's sister. Lily watches out for Maxine at school and encourages her to begin identifying as female. As her parents begin to pay more attention to Maxine, Lily begins to feel unloved. She is romantically interested in a school friend. * Alison Steadman as Barbara Pannell, Vicky's mother. She is initially critical of Vicky for allowing Maxine to identify as female, but later supports it. * Seán McGinley as Peter Duffy, Stephen's father. At first, he is concerned with Maxine's female gender identity.  Episodes  Broadcast The programme first aired on the free channel ITV in the UK, on Sunday evenings in the prime time slot of 9 p.m. It began on 14 October 2018 and concluded on 28 October. The American subscription service Hulu released the series in January 2019. In Italy, the series was broadcast on the paid channel Fox Life in December 2018 on Mondays at 9 p.m., after premiering at a film festival in Milan. In Sweden, it was shown in January 2019 by public broadcaster Sveriges Television. The programme aired in February 2019 in France, under the title De Max à Maxine (From Max to Maxine). It premiered on the M6-owned paid channel DTT before airing on the free channel 6ter. The same month, Butterfly was played at a cinema and appeared on the channel EITB in the Basque Country in Spain. It commemorated the one-year anniversary of transgender teenager 's suicide. Under the title Butterfly – Alle Meine Farben (Butterfly – All My Colours), the miniseries aired in Germany on the paid channel RTL Passion in January 2020, in the slot of Tuesday 8:15 p.m. Reception The first episode received an overnight rating of 2.8 million viewers. The three episodes overall garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers. Following the broadcast, Green reported that Mermaids had seen a spike in new members. Reaction to the miniseries by the transgender community and the public was largely positive. In Radio Times, Ash Palmisciano—the first transgender actor on the British soap Emmerdale—praised Butterfly as \\"a landmark story\\", describing it as \\"truthful, dark, heart-breaking [and] beautiful\\". The article contains praise from other trans commentators and activists who found the programme to present accurate and positive portrayals of trans people, whilst also displaying the difficulties of transitioning. Woman & Home, Digital Spy, OK! and PinkNews reported that it was well-received by viewers on social media, including by trans newsreader India Willoughby and Labour politician Dawn Butler. One woman interviewed by the Manchester Evening News described having a very similar situation to that of the programme's characters and said that the story \\"really hit home\\". However, some parents of transgender youth questioned whether Maxine was a gay boy who did not need to transition. The National Health Service's gender clinic, the Gender Identity Development Service, criticised the series' depiction of Maxine's suicide attempt, stating that it was \\"not helpful\\" due to the rarity of 11-year-olds attempting suicide, and reporting that fewer than one per cent of their patients attempted suicide. Green cited a 2016 Stonewall survey in which 45 percent of transgender children reported that they had attempted suicide. ITV commented that \\"Butterfly is one family's fictional story\\". The Sunday Times reported that \\"programme-makers visited the clinic early on but it is understood they parted company over differences\\". =Critical reception= Butterfly received very positive critical reception. The Independent gave the series four out of five stars, with the first episode receiving four stars in The Guardian and three in The Telegraph and The Times, and the next two episodes receiving four and three stars in The Times, respectively. It was widely praised for its subject matter and described as groundbreaking, emotional to watch and engaging. The writing was found to be nuanced. Anna Friel received praise in her role as Maxine's mother Vicky. The acting and characterisation was lauded by critics, with Lucy Mangan of The Guardian describing the characters as \\"fully realised\\" by \\"uniformly brilliant performances\\". Booth-Ford's acting as Maxine was praised by Euan Ferguson of The Observer, Sean O'Grady of The Independent and Carol Midgley of The Times, with Samantha Allen of The Daily Beast saying that he brought \\"believable vulnerability\\" to the character. The parents were praised by James Jackson of The Times as relatable. They were further praised by Midgley, who called Friel's acting \\"realistic\\" and found that Scanlan \\"plays a difficult role beautifully\\". Steadman's role of Barbara received mixed reception, Ferguson calling her cynical nature \\"superb\\" but Gabriel Tate of The Telegraph finding her character \\"phoned in\\". The depiction of transgender issues received widespread praise. Allen found it \\"informative\\" for audience members \\"who have only encountered transgender children in news articles\\". Jack Seale of The Guardian found it \\"unflinching\\" in its depiction of trauma caused by gender dysphoria, whilst Allen reviewed that a scene in which Vicky cries and wonders if she was responsible for Maxine's gender identity is \\"as moving as it is revealing of a specific anxiety\\". O'Grady highlights for praise a scene in which Lily says to Maxine: \\"I think of you as my sister\\". However, the subject matter also received limited negative reception. A negative review in The Telegraph by Allison Pearson criticised that the programme \\"unashamedly supports the transgender cause\\". Pearson described cases of trans people attempting suicide as \\"non-existent\\" and described Butterfly as \\"highly irresponsible\\" for displaying Maxine's suicide attempt. Also in The Telegraph, Tim Stanley critiqued the programme's depiction of manhood, commenting that \\"our culture doesn't value manly men quite the way it did\\". Tate called the series \\"carefully calibrated pushback against lazy prejudice\\" but nonetheless criticised its use of clichés and negatively compared parts of it to a public information film.

The film stars Amy Forsyth, Reign Edwards, Bex Taylor-Klaus, and Tony Todd, and follows a group of teens who are stalked by a serial killer while visiting a traveling Halloween carnival. It was released by CBS Films via Lionsgate. Hell Fest was released on September 28, 2018, and grossed $18.2 million at the box office on a budget of $5.5 million. It received generally mixed reviews from critics. Plot At Hell Fest, a travelling horror theme park, a masked man known as \\"The Other\\" kills a young woman when she is separated from her friends in a maze. The Other hangs her corpse in the maze so it blends in with the props. On Halloween night, Natalie goes to Hell Fest with her best friend Brooke, Brooke's roommate Taylor, their boyfriends Quinn and Asher, and their friend Gavin, who is interested in Natalie. The girls run into a terrified woman in one of the park's mazes trying to hide from the Other. Natalie, thinking this is part of the park experience, points out her hiding place. The Other kills the woman in front of Natalie after Taylor and Brooke leave. Natalie thinks the murder seemed too real to be a normal attraction, and once she reunites with the rest of her group notices the Other is stalking them. The group dismisses Natalie's fears until Brooke catches the Other stealing Natalie and Gavin's pictures from a photo booth. While the rest of the group enters another area of the park, Gavin tries to steal a prize for Natalie when he fails to win one in a carnival game. The Other corners Gavin, and crushes his skull with a mallet. Because Gavin is still gone, Natalie goes on a ride alone while the rest of her friends pair up. The ride breaks down, and Natalie is approached by a man who appears to be the Other. This is part of the ride, however, and the group discovers park employees wear a mask similar to the Other's. A park employee grabs Taylor and takes her away. The rest of the group splits up to find her, with the girls going in one maze while the boys go into another. The Other corners Natalie in a maze, but she escapes. Asher gets separated from Quinn, and is killed when the Other stabs him in the eye. The friends regroup, but they do not have much time to think about Asher's disappearance before an employee sprays Natalie with ooze. She goes into a bathroom to clean up, where the Other uses Gavin's phone to trap her in a stall. Natalie escapes and tries to warn park security about the Other, but a security guard dismisses the attack as part of the park experience. Natalie, Brooke and Quinn find Taylor has volunteered to take part in an attraction where she will be beheaded by a guillotine in front of a live audience. Park security prevents Natalie from stopping the show when she recognizes the Other's boots on the executioner. The blade appears to come down on Taylor's neck, but it only beheads a dummy that looks like her. The Other tries to kill Taylor, still restrained in the guillotine, when he is left alone with her after the show. Taylor escapes when the blade fails to cut through her neck on the first blow. She runs away, but the Other catches up to her, kills her, and then kills Quinn when he tries to intervene. As panic ensues in the park, security restrains a park employee they confuse for the killer. The Other traps Natalie and Brooke in a maze they mistake for the park exit. The girls are separated, and the Other corners Brooke. Natalie jumps out of a hidden door and stabs the Other in the gut before he can kill Brooke. As the girls make their way towards the maze's exit, police barge into the maze to save them and capture the killer. The Other, however, has escaped, and drives to his suburban home. He places his mask and the pictures of Natalie and Gavin that he stole into a cabinet with other masks and what appear to be trophies from his previous kills. The Other's young daughter wakes up to greet her father, and he gives her a stuffed animal from the park.

Club gave the film a D+ and said \\"even slasher junkies desperate for a fix will find themselves bored by Gregory Plotkin's lame second feature...it delivers the tedious, heavy-breathing buildup associated with the genre, but skimps on the scares and the gory, gooey good stuff.\\" Michael Nordine of IndieWire also gave the film a D+ and, while applauding its \\"vaguely feminist subtext,\\" found that \\"for the most part Hell Fest simply adheres to long-established genre tropes.\\" Home Media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 8, 2019 References External links * 2018 films American films American serial killer films English-language films 2018 horror films 2010s horror thriller films 2010s serial killer films 2010s slasher films 2010s teen horror films American horror thriller films American teen horror films American slasher films Halloween horror films Films produced by Gale Anne Hurd Films set in amusement parks Films set in Orange County, California Films shot in Atlanta CBS Films films Lionsgate films Vertigo Films films Films with screenplays by Stephen Susco Six Flags water parks Films scored by Bear McCreary ","title":"Hell Fest"},{"id":"55939425","text":"Also known as Hujer (singular Hijra).

It ends at the border road directly on the city boundary to the municipality Neubiberg in the district of Munich.  Description  The Balanstraße is, except for a small section between the Rosenheimer Platz and the Metzstraße where it is a one-way street about 30 m long, passable in both directions with one lane in each direction. Between Fasangartenstraße and Grenzstraße it only has one lane for both directions. Bicycle paths run almost continuously along it.  History  The street was named in 1880 after the French town of Balan near Sedan in the Ardennes. Where in 1870, the Battle of Sedan (Prussia v. France) took place, in which regiments of the Bavarian army alongside of Prussia took part. Since 1867, its previous official name was \\"Irrenweg\\" because of the Kreisirrenanstalt Munich located there since 1859 (until 1900, since 1919 it is the Salesianum for disadvantaged young people). After several residents had successfully protested against the streets name, it was renamed in favor of \\"glorious memories for the Bavarian army, esspecially for the Munich Regiments\\".  Road access  The stop Balanstraße at the \\"Mittlerer Ring\\" serves the bus lines 59, 139 and 145. The line 59 crosses the Balanstraße.

It is the best-known example of such an image.Früsorge 2015, p. 178. The image was badly damaged in the 1950s by members of Catholic Action.Hart 2008, p. 82. History Front view of Pascual Abaj in 2008 After the Spanish conquest, the stone figure is said to have been carried away from a site in the village of Chichicastenango and reset upon the hill so offerings could be made away from the vigilance of the Catholic Church and the Spanish colonists.Hart 2008, p. 81. Before it was defaced, the statue was described as a grotesque human figure with a large head and high, pointed forehead. It had two circular earspools in line with its mouth; its arms were crossed on its chest, with the fingers extended. A cord was sculpted around its waist, to which was attached the image of an inverted severed human head. It stood approximately high. An observer in the 1950s noted that the figure appeared to have been buried sometime in the past. Traditional Maya shamans regularly perform ceremonies at the shrine, by day and night. The statue is set upon a small altar surrounded by offerings, which include pine branches, crosses, flowers, copal resin, and items crafted from stone. The shrine has now become a popular tourist attraction where visitors witness traditional Maya ceremonies.Hart 2008, pp. 81–82.

Built about 1810 for John Treadwell, then the Governor of Connecticut, it is a distinctive local example of Federal period architecture with Greek Revival overlay features. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is now used for commercial purposes. Description and history The Treadwell House stands in the village center of Burlington, on the east side of its triangular green, between George Washington Turnpike and Spielman Highway (Connecticut Route 4). It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its primary facade faces south toward the turnpike, while a secondary facade faces west to the green, with the roof ridge oriented north-south. The south facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the right bay. The door and windows are framed by modest mouldings, and there is a half-round opening (presently filled with a louver, but originally with a window) in the gable above. The west facade is also three bays wide, with a more elaborate but false entrance at its center, framed by pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. A modernized ell extends eastward from the main block. The house was built about 1810 for John Treadwell, a Farmington native who was then serving as Governor of Connecticut; however, there is no evidence he ever actually resided here, since his residence was always listed as Farmington. The house is remarkably little-altered, and some of its Greek Revival features are a notably early adoption of that style. The next two owners of the house were ministers at the local Congregational church. The building was purchased by the town in 1970, which used it for storage. Declared surplus in the late 1970s, it was rescued from demolition by local preservationists, and readapted for use as a bank.

He is also a productive writer, editor, and social activist, and was a legal scholar at Chengdu University before he resigned to take up the pastorate.  Biography  In 2004, he was included in the list of \\"50 Most Influential Public Intellectuals of China\\" by ' (). In 2005, he was converted, baptized, and started to serve in the house church. He was among the few pioneering Christian human-rights attorneys in China. Wang Yi met with President George W. Bush at the White House in 2006, with other Chinese human rights attorneys, to discuss religious freedom in China. He returned to Washington, D.C. in 2008, to attend the Conference for Global Christians in Law and was awarded \\"Prize for the Contribution to Promoting Religious Freedom.\\" In 2008, he founded and started to serve the Chengdu Early Rain Reformed Church () (later renamed as the Early Rain Covenant Church). In October 2011, he was ordained and became the senior pastor of the church. The church now had a membership of about 700 before it was closed down in late 2018. Wang Yi was one of China's best-known pastors in the West. He and Early Rain have been profiled in The Atlantic and New York Times, and the subject of a number of journalist and academic works. A review by the editorial board of the Washington Post called Wang \\"a paragon of the noble aspiration that people be allowed to think, speak, worship and assemble freely\\". On 9 December 2018, he and over 100 other members of the church were arrested by Chinese authorities, who simultaneously banned any reporting of the crackdown. This action is being objected to by the US Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. After he had been detained for 48 hours, the Early Rain Covenant Church released Wang's \\"My Declaration of Faithful Disobedience\\" written two months earlier in anticipation of his arrest. On 30 December 2019, Wang was given a prison sentence of nine years by Chengdu Intermediate People's Court for \\"inciting subversion of state power and illegal business operations.\\" The sentence also included the stripping of his political rights for three years and the confiscation of his personal assets of RMB 50,000 (US$ 7,000).Paul Mozur and Ian Johnson (Dec. 30, 2019), China Sentences Wang Yi, Christian Pastor, to 9 Years in Prison\\", New York Times. Retrieved 1 March 2020. On 31 December 2019, U.S. State Department called China for Wang's immediate and unconditional release in a statement, saying \\"This is yet another example of Beijing's intensification of repression of Chinese Christians and members of other religious groups\\". On 1 January 2020, the embassy of the Netherlands in Beijing posted a message on Chinese social network Sina Weibo, which emphasized the importance of freedom of religion, with a screenshot of the Chinese court document about the sentence of Wang Yi.  Theology  Wang Yi argues that the idea of the separation of church and state originated from the Calvinist tradition. He criticizes the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in China as emphasizing nationalism, which he claims results in a worship of secular authorities at the cost of valuing the local community. Instead, he argues that the separation of church and state in the United States is deeply rooted in the Calvinist tradition. This holds to a view in which a constitutional polity is legitimized by a transcendent power – namely, a sovereign God. Furthermore, he claims that the nation cannot interfere with church affairs, on the one hand, and should be obliged to protect the religious freedom out of the divine duty, on the other. Wang wants to promote the transparency and publicity of the Chinese house church. Wang argues that churches ought to not only listen for God's voice, but also engage in public affairs. For him, the Reformed church in China should have a pastoral mission for the Chinese church and a prophetic mission for Chinese society. According to Fredrik Fällman, Wang Yi sees this as the mechanism by which \\"New Genevas\\" are established throughout China, akin to John Calvin's Christian reforms in Geneva.  Chinese 95 theses  In August 2015, Wang Yi posted a document titled \\"Reaffirming our Stance on the House Churches: 95 theses\\" in an attempt to reaffirm the Chinese house church's position in the relationship between government and society. Echoing Martin Luther's 95 theses, these Chinese 95 theses demonstrate his opinion of the church-state relationship from the perspective of the house church. This document is divided into 6 sections: * Theses 1–17: God's Sovereignty and Biblical Authority. * Theses 18–31: God's Law and Christ's Redemption. * Theses 32–39: Against the \\"Sinicization of Christianity.\\" * Theses 40–44: Church as the Body of Christ and His Kingdom. * Theses 45–72: The Relationship between Two Kingdoms and the Separation of Church and State. * Theses 73–95: Against the \\"Three-Self Movement\\" and Affirmation of the Great Commission.

Educated in the United States, he chose to stay in China after the Second World War though many of his academic colleagues moved to Taiwan. He was severely punished during the Cultural Revolution despite being a member of the Communist Party.  Biography  =Early life= Cheng was born in Fujian in November 18, 1906 and grew up with an interest in the local birds. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was very young and he was taken care of mostly by his grandmother. His father was one of the few Chinese with a higher education and knew English. His father taught him to speak English. As a young boy he was weak and his father encouraged the boy to take up sports. Cheng hiked in the mountains, played tennis and even became a champion 100 m sprinter. His early naturalist interests were in the nature of culinary objects. He collected fish, wild fruit and vegetables which his grandmother cooked. He went to the high school at Fuzhou and sought admission to the Fujian Christian University at the age of 15 which required him to undergo a special test. The English professor of biology there asked the applicants about which vegetable had the highest vitamins and he was the only one to come up with the answer as tomato. Tomatoes were then unheard of in China but Cheng had read about them, leading to his being admitted. He graduated in 1926 after seven semesters after which he wished to move to the United States. = USA= An uncle who was a doctor in Fuzhou funded Cheng's travel and he chose the University of Michigan as a cousin studied there. He studied under Peter Olas Okkelberg and received a doctorate in 1930 for his thesis on \\"The Germ Cell history of Rana cantabrigensis Baird\\". He also received a Sigma Xi golden Key award. While in the US he had visited the natural history of the museum and had wondered about a golden pheasant specimen. He wondered why all the species in China in recent times were described by non-Chinese. He also knew of 3000 year old classical Chinese literature which had described a 100 bird species. He chose to return to China and rejected offers to work in the United States. = China = Returning to China in 1930 he joined the Fujian Christian University and later founded the China Zoological Society and headed the department of biology at Fuzhou. In 1938 his university moved to Shao-wu due to the threat of the Japanese invasion. He moved to the US in April 1945 to work on Chinese ornithology, examining specimens in museums and universities across America. He returned to Fuzhou in September 1946. In 1947 he was forced to move to Nanjing due to civil war between Maoists and the Kuomintang. In 1948 many university staff fled to Taiwan and Cheng also considered it. He however asked around and was told that the communist party needed scientists. He then remained and joined the Communist Party. In 1950 he moved to Beijing and became a curator of birds at the Academia Sinica and founded the Peking Natural History Museum in 1951. He was the first director of the scientific publications office. He translated Joachim Steinbacher's book on bird migration and ornithology into Chinese. From 1955 to 1957 he worked along with Soviet and East German ornithologists in expeditions and studies in southern Yunnan and northeastern China. =Cultural Revolution= In 1958 Cheng's work in China was interrupted by a campaign to eradicate sparrows (along with mice, flies and mosquitoes). Cheng was, for ecological reasons, against the campaign from the start but it was only in 1959 that he could influence a decision against the killing of sparrows. He travelled to East Germany in May 1957 and worked with Erwin Stresemann examining specimens from the Chinese region. He was also able to meet other ornithologist like L A Portenko, Charles Vaurie, and Gunther Niethammer in meetings that Stresemann called as the \\"Atlantic Pacific Conference\\". He was however not allowed to attend evening parties at Stresemann's home in West Berlin due to instructions from the Chinese embassy in East Germany. Cheng was made a foreign correspondent of the German Ornithologists' Society through the nomination of Stresemann. Cheng returned to China with stays in Leningrad and Moscow. Returning to China he was faced by Mao's Cultural Revolution. Scientific work came to a halt and a slogan was that \\"the more knowledge you possess, the more you are a revolutionary\\". Cheng was declared a criminal as he had opposed Chairman Mao's campaign against sparrows. He was told that \\"birds are public animals of capitalism\\" and had to wear a badge that read \\"reactionary\\" and made to undergo an examination of his supposed ornithological training apart from being forced to sweep the corridors and clean toilets. The test was given by a committee and he was asked to identify a bird made up of parts from multiple species. After failing the \\"test\\", his salary was reduced to a bare minimum. In August 1966 he was kept in isolation in a cowshed for six months and his house was searched by Red Guards who confiscated all his belongings including a typewriter that he valued the most. The Academia Sinica was occupied by the Red Guards from 1967 until 1968 when Mao ordered their removal. Peace returned only in the 1970s and his work on the birds of China was sent for publication after having been rejected once earlier. It was published in 1978, but dated as 1976, and he was forced to include a long quotation from Mao, who had since died. After Mao's death, Cheng was invited to an international symposium of the World Pheasant Association in November 1978. He also spent two months in England during which time he met Sir Peter Scott and G.V.T.Matthews. He served as a professor at the Beijing Normal University and in 1987 he and his colleagues published a Synopsis of the Avifauna of China. He also edited the Fauna Sinica, Aves volumes from 1970 to 1980. He worked on bird conservation and worked on international collaboration for the protection of migratory species. =Personal life = Cheng met Chen Jia-jang (Lydia) while playing tennis and married her in 1942. In 1992 the couple celebrated their golden anniversary with Cheng gifting the golden key from Michigan to his wife and receiving in turn a gift of a golden pencil. = Honours = Cheng died from a heart attack in 1998. Several species have been named in his honour including Cheng's jird (Meriones chengi) Wang, 1964. Pamela Rasmussen named the Sichuan bush warbler (Locustella chengi) discovered in 2015 after Professor Cheng.

Tursiannotko is a Late Iron Age dwelling site located in Pirkkala, Finland. It has been archaeologically excavated since 1999. Site It's estimated that the dwelling site was inhabited at the beginning of the Viking Age. While some individual finds have been dated to as early as the 5th century, there are no structural remains supporting that early habitation. The excavations have uncovered remains of 3-5 houses that were dated from Late Iron Age to 13th century. The only house that has been completely excavated is one-roomed log cabin, that was built on top of a clay flooring. Radiocarbon dating has dated the cabin to the 9th or 10th century, being from the beginning or mid Viking Age. During the excavation, a foundation for possible stove was found inside the cabin, which would make it the oldest dated stove found in Finland. Another cabin that has been partially excavated was dated to the 11th or 12th century, meaning the Late Vaking Age or Early Crusade Age. Due to the suitable soil conditions, Tursiannotko bone artifacts have preserved exceptionally well in contrary to other archaeological sites in Finland. As of 2017, 1560 excavated bone fragments have been identified, the most common animal being pig. Besides dietary bone fragments, there have been discoveries of multiple bone objects, including arrow heads. Tursiannotko dwelling site grew steadily during the Middle Ages and by 15th century it had grown into the Pirkkalankylä village, that was first mentioned in 1442.

Its principles are: self-governance, self- support (i.e., financial independence from foreigners), and self-propagation (i.e., indigenous missionary work). It was first coined in the late-19th century by various missions theorists, and is still used today in certain contexts such as in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in mainland China.  History  The three principles of self-governance, self-support (i.e., financial independence from foreigners), and self-propagation (i.e., indigenous missionary work) were first articulated by Henry Venn, General Secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1841 to 1873, and Rufus Anderson, foreign secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions... The \\"Nevius Method,\\" named for John Livingstone Nevius, a missionary to China and Korea, developed the three-self principle of Venn and Anderson into a plan for establishing indigenous churches. By 1877 three-self principles were much discussed among missionaries to China. The principles were drafted formally during an 1892 conference in Shanghai of Christian missions reflecting an almost universal agreement that the future of the Chinese church depended on the indigenization of the leadership, and the finding of sufficiently Chinese modes of worship.. In the early 20th century Roland Allen, a former Anglican missionary to China wrote two influential books that promoted the concept of indigenous churches based on the three-self principle. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) in mainland China, now the officially sanctioned form of Protestant Christianity in China, took these principles as foundational for its establishment. However, in its alignment with China's United Front Work Department, the TSPM sought to unify all Christians in China behind the government's political and social agenda and thus politicized matters of religious belief and practice and \\"subordinated the religious mission of the church to the political agenda of the Communist Party.\\" This represented a fundamental change in the concept of the three-self principle from a religious one to a political one. The TSPM’s implementation resulted in the suppression of other expressions of three-self principles that pre-existed it. The mission historian David Bosch has argued that there needs to now be a fourth \\"self,\\" self-theologizing.

Albrecht \\"Ali\\" Höhler (April 30, 1898 – September 20, 1933) was a member of the Red Front Fighters Association (RFB). He is known for the killing of Horst Wessel, a local leader in Berlin of the Nazi Party's SA stormtroopers. After the Nazis came to power, Höhler was taken out of prison and assassinated by the SA.  Life  Born in Mainz, Höhler was a carpenter and a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1924. He was also a member of the Red Front Fighter Association and continued to be active in the RFB after its prohibition in 1929. By 1930, he was residing in the Mitte borough of Berlin.Knobloch, Heinz (1993) Der arme Epstein – Wie der Tod zu Horst Wessel kam. Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag.  Killing of Horst Wessel  The Red Front Fighter Alliance was alerted about a rental dispute between the communist affiliated landlord Elisabeth Salm and her tenant Horst Wessel on January 14, 1930. According to information revealed in court, the notorious SA man was targeted for a \\"proletarian beating\\". This action was most likely politically motivated; Horst Wessel was called out as the \\"murderer of workers\\" in neighborhood posters put up by the Communist Party. Wessel was involved in numerous violent actions against communists in Berlin and was well known to Nazi Party Gauleiter (regional leader) Joseph Goebbels. Since it was known that Wessel had a firearm, Höhler took his gun in the RFB- led confrontation with Wessel. Höhler later stated in court that he shot Wessel as he reached for his pocket. The seriously injured Wessel died on February 23, 1930, as a result of the gunshot wound.  Imprisonment and assassination  Höhler first fled to Prague, but then returned to Berlin where he was arrested. On September 26, 1930, Höhler was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to six years imprisonment at Wohlau Prison. After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party, Höhler was transferred to a Gestapo prison in Berlin, allegedly to interrogate him about a retrial. He demanded to be returned to Wohlau. On September 20, 1933, Höhler was taken on the orders of SA Gruppenführer Karl Ernst by three detectives, including the SA-member Willi Schmidt. He was transferred from the police prison at Alexanderplatz on the basis of a Gestapo signed delivery order. Near Potsdamer Platz, several more vehicles approached the prisoner van. The vehicle column drove towards Frankfurt on the Oder. About 12 km from Frankfurt, the column stopped. Höhler was ordered to leave the transport and was led by a group of at least eight people away from the road to a nearby forest. There, Gruppenführer Ernst gave a short speech in which he condemned Höhler to death as murderer of Horst Wessel. Höhler was then shot by several of those present near the Berlin- Frankfurt Chaussee. The body was barely buried on the spot. The official report on the incident allegedly stated that the transport had been intercepted on the street by a group of seven to eight SA men and that the officers had been forced to surrender Höhler under threat of violence, which had then been abducted with an unknown destination.  Later investigation  After an investigation of the Berlin prosecutor's office in the 1960s, the murderers of Höhler were identified as Ernst, his adjutant Walter von Mohrenschildt, the SA-Standartenführer Richard Fiedler, the Sturmbannführer Willi Markus, the Gruppenführer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, the Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels (who veiled the facts in his memoirs), the detectives Maikowski and Pohlenz and possibly the legal adviser of the SA group in Berlin-Brandenburg, Gerd Voss. The fatal shots were probably made by Ernst and Mohrenschildt, according to the findings of the prosecutor. Ernst was then said to have organized the murder on the orders of Ernst Röhm, who had in turn received orders from Adolf Hitler that the killer of Wessel was to be summarily shot. In 1933, investigations into the murder of Höhler were quickly stopped due to political pressure. Even the police's official report to the prosecutor stated that Diels falsely disclosed that Höhler had been kidnapped from police custody and that \\"the act was perpetrated on Höhler's person for special reasons.\\" After the resumption of investigations in the 1960s, the true course of events were discovered by interrogating Willi Schmidt and the chauffeur of Karl Ernst. The investigation of the surviving perpetrators Schmidt, Pohlenz, Markus and Fiedler were finally discontinued in 1969 because they could only prove aiding and abetting the murder, which was already time- barred at that time.

The flowering stems are about 10–12 cm tall, and bear up to four flowers, with six 1–1.5 cm-long tepals, each with a sharply pointed tip. Forms described under the synonym Leucojum tingitanum are less robust, with narrower leaves. Taxonomy Acis tingitana was first described in 1878 by John Gilbert Baker, as Leucojum tingitanum. The specific epithet tingitanus refers to Tangier, in Morocco. In 1934, René Maire described Leucojum fontianum. Although in 1987 Brian Mathew regarded the two species as distinct, in 1992, he synonymized them. In 2004, Leucojum tingitanum was transferred to the genus Acis, along with other species of Leucojum, on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic study.

Announced on 28 November 2017, it followed previous electric flight demonstrators towards sustainable transport for the European Commission’s Flightpath 2050 Vision. A BAe 146 flying testbed was to have one of its four Lycoming ALF502 turbofans replaced by a Siemens electric motor, adapted by Rolls-Royce and powered by its AE2100 turboshaft, controlled and integrated by Airbus with a battery. In April 2020, the programme was cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Development Announced on 28 November 2017 at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, the E-Fan X was initially planned to fly in 2020. It follows previous electric flight demonstrators: Cri-cri, e-Genius, E-Star and the E-Fan 1.2. It will anticipate a safe, efficient, and cost- effective hybrid single-aisle airliner. Airbus and Siemens have collaborated since April 2016 on the E-Aircraft Systems House for electric propulsion components, including ground tests. It will help establish certification requirements for electric aircraft. Existing technologies cannot achieve European Commission’s Flightpath 2050 Vision for Aviation goals towards sustainable transports: a reduction of CO2 by 75%, NOx by 90% and noise by 65%; new technologies are needed including electrification. (Airbus, Rolls- Royce, Siemens) At the 2018 Farnborough Airshow, Greg Clark, Business and Energy Secretary, announced the UK Department for BEIS will commit a part of the £255 million invested to develop greener flight technologies. At the June 2019 Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce announced its acquisition of Siemens' electric propulsion branch, to be completed in late 2019, employing 180 in Germany and Hungary. On 19 August 2019, the compact generator was run for the first time in Trondheim, Norway, before integration with an AE2100 turboprop from a Saab 2000 feeding the battery pack and a Siemens SP2000 electric motor (with a 10 kW/kg power-to-weight ratio) replacing one Honeywell LF507 engine with a Rolls-Royce AE 3007 fan, through a 3,000 volts AC/DC distribution. By November 2019, the airframe (G-WEFX) had arrived at Cranfield to be modified; first flight was then planned for 2021. In April 2020, the programme was cancelled among the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A BAe 146 flying testbed will have one of its four turbofans replaced by a electric motor, with provisions to replace a second turbofan. Airbus will build the control architecture and integrate the systems, Rolls-Royce will adapt the Siemens motor and the fan to the existing nacelle, bring the turboshaft, generator and power electronics and Siemens the electric motor and its power electronic control unit, the inverter, DC/DC converter and power distribution. High-power propulsion systems are challenged by thermal effects, electric thrust management, altitude and dynamic effects on electric systems and electromagnetic compatibility issues. An inboard Lycoming ALF502 is replaced with a same thrust Citation X/ERJ-145 AE3007 nacelle, but with its core replaced with the electric motor and inverter and the C-130J's AE2100 turboshaft in the rear fuselage with its air inlet behind the wing - both using the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor's Liberty T406 core. While Rolls-Royce is experienced in industrial and naval applications, the generator feeding a 3,000 V DC distribution through its AC/DC converter are firsts in aviation. Airbus supplies a , battery in the cargo holds, a 30 times step up from the E-Fan. The Siemens motor Power/Mass ratio will be higher than the of the 2017 Paris Air Show Extra 330 demonstrator. The motor and generator are not cryogenically cooled and not superconducting for more than 15% of losses but ultimate efficiency is not a prime target. The Rolls generator is oil-cooled with supercritical carbon dioxide as the intermediary cooling fluid, building on Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks’ power system for the Aurora XV-24A LightningStrike: a high-speed VTOL aircraft scheduled to fly in 2018 with electric distributed propulsion using Rolls’ AE1107 turboshaft (with the same AE2100 core) driving three Honeywell generators. The nacelle outer mold line will be kept to maintain the BAe 146 airworthiness approval. A Siemens DC/AC converter power electronics will feed the SP2000 liquid cooled motor, eight times more powerful than the Extra 330E's Siemens SP260D, the most powerful motor flying now with for 50 kg (110 lb). The electric machines should attain a 10-times-higher power-to-weight ratio. Pressurization, insulation and separation will avoid the corona effect: high altitude, high voltage arcing. Hybrid electric can offer improvements with present Battery Technologies : using them to boost power for takeoff and climb and electric-only descent would lower fuel burn per sector by double digits, and would reduce noise and local atmospheric emissions.

It has very narrow leaves. The flowers are produced in late winter or early spring and are usually white, but sometimes pink-tinged or all pink. The species is cultivated as an ornamental bulb, but requires protection from hard frost. Description Acis trichophylla is a bulbous perennial, growing up to 30 cm tall, although usually shorter. There are generally three very narrow leaves per bulb, appearing before the flowers, each leaf being up to 18 cm long but only at most 1 mm wide. Flowering is in late winter or early spring. The flowers are white, sometimes with pink tinges or occasionally all pink, and are arranged in groups of two to four on a stem (scape) that is about as long as or longer than the leaves. Each flower is borne on a long stalk (pedicel), up to 45 or 60 mm long, and has six tepals, 12–20 mm long, with sharp tips, that open widely to form a bell shape. The two spathes are shorter than the pedicels. The style is slightly longer than the stamens. Taxonomy The nomenclature of Acis trichophylla is somewhat complex. The epithet trichophyllum was first published, in the combination Leucojum trichophyllum, by Peter Schousboe in 1800. The combination was used again as a supposedly new name by Félix Brotero in 1804, but as it had already been published in 1800, Leucojum trichophyllum Brot. is an illegitimate later homonym. In 1829, Robert Sweet suggested that Leucojum trichophyllum belonged in Acis, but did not explicitly use the combination Acis trichophylla nor make clear whose Leucojum name he meant. The combination Acis trichophylla was first used in 1830 by George Don, referring to Sweet (he actually used the masculine form trichophyllus). Although William Herbert in 1837 also placed the species in Acis, most later botanists used the genus Leucojum, treating it as L. trichophyllum Schousb. In 2004, it was restored to Acis, along with other species of Leucojum, on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic study. A number of infraspecies have been described, none of which are recognized by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families . Forms with pinkish flowers have been called f. broteri and f. purpurascens, those with larger flowers var. grandiflorum. Distribution and habitat Acis trichophylla is found in central and southern Portugal, south central and south-western Spain and across the Mediterranean in Morocco. It is found in dry sandy ground. Cultivation Acis trichophylla is cultivated as an ornamental bulb. It requires protection from frost, and warm dry conditions for a long time in summer, hence growing in an alpine house or bulb frame is recommended. Unless planted deeply, around 15 cm, it tends to divide into small non-flowering bulbs.

NASA Goddard Multimedia Accessed June 2012 Climate restoration consists of a goal and associated actions intended to reverse the current trends of climate change and, on some timescale and trajectory, to restore the Earth system to a safe, sustainable and productive state, for the well-being of future generations and all humanity. Such actions include the carbon dioxide removal from the Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and increasing biosequestration and carbon sequestration, which, in combination with emissions reductions, will reduce the level of in the atmosphere and thereby reduce the global warming produced by the greenhouse effect of an excess of over its pre-industrial level.  Restoration and mitigation Climate restoration is the goal underlying climate change mitigation, whose actions are intended to \\"limit the magnitude or rate of long-term climate change\\". Advocates of climate restoration accept that climate change has already had major negative impacts which threaten the long-term survival of humanity. The current mitigation pathway leaves the risk that conditions will go beyond adaptation and abrupt climate change will be upon us. There is a human moral imperative to maximize the chances of future generations' survival. By promoting the vision of the \\"survival and flourishing of humanity\\", with the Earth System restored to a state close to that in which our species and civilization evolved, advocates claim that there is a huge incentive for innovation and investment to ensure that this restoration takes place safely and in a timely fashion. As stated in \\"The Economist\\" in November 2017, \\"in any realistic scenario, emissions cannot be cut fast enough to keep the total stock of greenhouse gases sufficiently small to limit the rise in temperature successfully. But there is barely any public discussion of how to bring about the extra “negative emissions\\" needed to reduce the stock of ... Unless that changes, the promise of limiting the harm of climate change is almost certain to be broken.\\"  Climate restoration as a policy goal A first peer-reviewed article about climate restoration was published in April 2018 by the Rand Corporation. The analysis \\"examines climate restoration through the lens of risk management under conditions of deep uncertainty, exploring the technology, economic, and policy conditions under which it might be possible to achieve various climate restoration goals and the conditions under which society might be better off with (rather than without) a climate restoration goal.\\" One key finding of the study is that it would be possible to restore the CO2 atmospheric concentrations to preindustrial levels at an acceptable cost under two scenarios, where greenhouse gas reductions and direct air capture (DAC) technologies prove to be economically efficient. One example is Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company focussing on the commercialization of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere. One key recommendation of the Rand Corporation study is that an ambitious climate restoration goal may seek to achieve preindustrial concentration by 2075, or by the end of the century. It concludes that \\"The best we can do is pursue climate restoration with a passion while embedding it in a process of testing, experimentation, correction, and discovery.\\" Capitol dome before a warming stripes graphic depicting annual global temperature rise.

Jamie Raskin introduced a resolution on Climate Restoration to the U.S House Committee of Energy and Commerce, concluding with \\"Whereas scientists have researched methods for keeping warming below 2° C, but have not yet researched the best methods to remove all excess CO2, stop sea-level rise, and restore a safe and healthy climate for future generations; and whereas declaring a goal of restoring a safe and healthy climate will encourage scientists to research the most effective ways to restore safe CO2 levels, stop sea-level rise, and restore a safe and healthy climate for future generations.\\" This was followed by the Congressional Climate Emergency Resolutions (S.Con.Res.22, H.Con.Res.52) which \\"demands a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale to halt, reverse, mitigate, and prepare for the consequences of the climate emergency and to restore the climate for future generations....”  Critical parameters The endpoint goal of climate restoration is to generally maximize the probability of survival of our species and civilization by restoring Atmospheric CO2 levels. The approximate target levels are those of the Holocene norm in which our species and civilization most recently evolved. That is stated technically as \\"pre-industrial\\", or poetically as \\"like our grandparents had a hundred years ago\\". Numerically the goal is stated as getting atmospheric CO2 back below the highest levels humans have survived long-term, 300 ppm, by 2050. Achieving this will require permanently removing approximately a trillion tonnes of atmospheric CO2. Critical parameters of the Earth System include: * levels of climate forcing agents in the atmosphere, especially and methane for positive forcing and SO2 aerosol for negative forcing; * global mean surface temperature (compared to some baseline) and its rate of increase; * sea level and the rate that sea level is rising; * pH and rate of ocean acidification. * Ice levels of the polar ice caps. One of the principal goals for climate restoration is to bring the level down from current level of ~405 ppm (2016) towards its pre-industrial level of ~280 ppm. Not only will this reduce ’s global warming effect but also its effect on ocean acidification. The removed carbon would be sequestered or used as a construction material. Climate Restoration White Paper On September 17, 2019, the Foundation for Climate Restoration published a White Paper on existing Climate Restoration solutions and developing technologies. These solutions and technologies include proven, commercially viable projects, such as creating synthetic rock from carbon captured in the air for use in construction and paving, as well as emerging methods for removing and storing carbon, restoring oceans and fisheries. The White Paper also discusses Climate Restoration strategy and costs. A main goal of the Foundation for Climate Restoration is the reduction of atmospheric to below 300 ppm (i.e. near its pre-industrial level) by 2050.  Limitations Not every aspect of the Earth System can be returned to a previous state: notably the warming of the deep sea or deep ocean and the associated sea level rise which has already taken place may be essentially irreversible this century. Conversely, there are certain aspects of the Earth System that need to be improved with respect to the recent past: notably food productivity, considering an increased global population by 2050 or 2100.

Design and development In the early 1930s the Navy became interested in exploring amphibious capabilities for its cruiser- based observation and scout floatplanes to remedy the problem of periodically having to rig the wheeled undercarriage and then revert to floats. After some experiments, installing retractable landing gear into the existing types' floats was ruled out due to degradation in performance. A purpose-built amphibian, however, was viewed as a potentially better solution. Three companies – Great Lakes, Keystone-Loening and Sikorsky - submitted aircraft to meet the Navy's requirements, with their designs designated XSG-1, XS2L-1 and XSS-1 respectively. The Loening's entry was a conventional biplane that featured flying boat hull, retractable main landing gear and a single R-985 Wasp Junior engine in a nacelle on the upper wing. The pilot and observer were seated in an enclosed cockpit that also encompassed some of the interplane struts, resulting in a curiously shaped glazing area. The XS2L-1 was delivered for official trials in February 1933. Although it showed marginally better performance than its rivals, it still offered no considerable advantages over the existing floatplanes like the Vought O3U-3 and Berliner-Joyce OJ-2, and no production resulted.

Upon her 1903 marriage, she became a British citizen and wife of the Governor of the Bahamas. Within a year, her husband was appointed as Governor of Barbados, and she moved with him to Bridgetown. Immediately becoming involved in the local community, she designed a stamp for the 300th anniversary of the annexation of Barbados by Great Britain. Though Carter continued to produce art, she became more known for her designs of gardens and homes. Carter designed the garden at Queen's Park, as well as several other landmarks. The couple's home, Ilaro Court was designed and built upon her plans and later became the official residence of the Prime Minister of Barbados. A feminist, she established the Women's Self Help Association to assist women in earning their own income and fought for their right to vote. Traveling world-wide frequently, she maintained her home in Barbados until her death. Early life Gertrude Codman Parker was born on February 6, 1875 in Boston, Massachusetts as the only child of Mary (née Codman) and Francis Vose Parker. On her father's side, she descended from Abraham Parker, who settled in America in 1644 and Richard Russell, treasurer of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She also had roots in Barbados through Nathaniel Kingsland. Her father was the president of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad and a well-known financier. Her mother was related to the Codman family, who settled the Dorchester neighborhood in Boston, including her parents Anna Gertrude (née Dey) and John Codman, a merchant and art collector; a grandfather John Codman; and a relative, John Amory Codman, the noted artist. Parker grew up in a prominent Bostonian family which had long supported the development of the arts and was educated in private schools. She had her social debut in Boston in the 1893–1894 season and then enrolled in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1895, studying under the tutelage of Philip Leslie Hale. Influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, she studied wood engraving and was commissioned in 1900 to prepare the cover plate for The History and Development of the American Cabinet Organ, shortly before her graduation. The following year, she begin studying in Italy, reportedly studying at the Villa Medici. As women were not allowed to attend courses at the Villa Medici, it is probable that she studied at the Ecole de Nu, informally studying with others who were allowed to enroll at the Villa Medici, before returning to Boston in 1902. In the winter of 1902, while on vacation with her parents in Nassau, Parker met the father of one of her Bostonian friends, Sir Gilbert Thomas Carter, who was the Governor of the Bahamas. After a whirlwind courtship, twenty-eight-year-old Parker, married the widowed fifty-five-year-old governor on 25 August 1903, at a ceremony held at the Church of the Advent in Boston. At the time Parker married Gilbert T. Carter, U.S. law held that she lost her American citizenship and acquired her husband's. Until the Cable Act was passed in 1922, she would not have been able to reacquire American citizenship. Career Olive Blossom 1905 issue Immediately after their two- month honeymoon, the couple returned to Nassau, where Carter served as hostess for her husband. In 1904, Sir Gilbert-Carter was posted as the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Island of Barbados and its Dependencies. When the couple arrived in Bridgetown, preparations were underway for the Tercentenary of Annexation of Barbados by the British Empire and Nelson Centenary celebrations. Carter immediately submitted two stamp designs for the competition, including a bust of Nelson for the Trafalgar contest and a design of the ship Olive Blossom, which had purportedly landed in Barbados, annexing the island to Britain in 1605. While Carter's design was not selected for the Nelson bust, her design for the tercentenary stamp won and was issued in 1906. That same year, Carter submitted designs for the garden at the Queen's Park, which were accepted and completed in 1909. She also designed the gardens for the lazaretto, the leper quarantine asylum; the Empire Theatre; and the couple's residence, Ilaro Court, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of Barbados. Finding inspiration in the tropical setting, Carter produced drawings, gouaches and watercolours, in an impressionist style, balancing light and movement with strong design elements. Her subjects depicted images of life in the busy port of Bridgetown, which she observed in her every day dealings, including scenes of the yacht club, the Chamberlain Bridge, and the Colonial Secretary's Office. Interested in improving the lives of women, Carter was one of the founders of the Women's Self Help Association. She proposed creation of the association in 1907 to allow women to sell handicrafts and homemade foods to tourists, enabling women to have their own income. She also served as the patron of the Civic Circle, a group aimed at public beautification. Governor Gilbert Carter served as acting governor of Trinidad and Tobago as well from 1907 and then he retired in 1910. The following year, in Boston, Carter gave birth to a son, John Codman Carter, (who later went by Gilbert-Carter). Her son inspired Carter to write a book A Tropical Alphabet (ca. 1915), which was illustrated with images of things found commonly in the tropics. Carter explained in the preface that the book was written for English children living in the West Indies because most of the illustrated alphabet books used images of things like apples or foxes which were alien to them. Instead, she pictured grapefruit and other tropical items. Gilbert Thomas Carter, Gertrude Carter and John Codman Carter, 1916 Between 1915 and 1920, the family made their home in Torquay, taking frequent trips back to Barbados, as well as touring Europe and visiting friends and family in Boston and New York City. During this time, Carter kept diaries recounting their daily business and extensive travel, as well as concerns over World War I. Her husband legally changed the family surname to Gilbert-Carter in 1919 and they returned to live in Ilaro and Barbados the following year. In 1924, Carter designed the Barbados exhibition hall for the British Empire Exhibition, held in Wembley. Basing her pavilion design on the historical dependence on cotton, sugar and rum and the modern development of tourism, she reproduced the Barbadian landscape in alcoves flanked with tropical orchids, palm trees, coral, conch shells, and images of blow fish and turtles. On display were pottery and other handcrafted items from the Women's Self Help Association, as well as products like cane sugar, syrup, baskets and woven rush furniture. Sir Gilbert Carter died in Bridgetown on 18 January 1927. Carter continued to live in Barbados, traveling frequently to Boston and Palm Beach, and summering in Bar Harbor, Maine. A supporter of suffrage, she served as a representative for Barbados in London in 1929 during the National Council of Women of Great Britain’s discussion on international voting rights for women who had property and were taxpayers. Carter donated some of her artworks and other memorabilia to the Barbados Museum and Historical Society in 1952 and a special exhibition of her work was held. Death and legacy Carter died on November 12, 1953 in Boston, Massachusetts and was buried alongside her husband at St. Michael's Cathedral in Bridgetown, Barbados. Her diaries from 1915 to 1920 are in the archives of the Massachusetts Historical Society and were serialized in 2017 in the society's blog, The Beehive.

Legend  Gottfried Kinkel's remarks about the Teufelsley included the following: \\"This quite fantastic rock rises on a narrow ridge, so that it looks as if it has been shattered by a massive blow from the east. There is no doubt that the legend, in which the devil built the castle here, high in the heavens, in defiance of God, was based on this observation of the rocks, which had already been made by people in the past with a natural astuteness. (...) This time, as always, it di not turn out well for the devil: his half-finished castle was smashed a single blow of the God's hand, and the rock really does give the impression of a Cyclopian castle ruin..\\" However, there is no historical evidence at all indicating that there was actually a castle on the Teufelsley and neither are any ruins discernible.

It was printed full size and is an early illustration of a snowy owl and part of The Birds of America. It was first published as part of a series in sections around 1831. This specific engraving of the snowy owl, like others in The Birds of America, consists of a hand-coloured engraving, made from copper engraved plates, measuring around . The same book includes images of six now- extinct birds. Art historians describe the quality of Audubon's work as being high and printed with \\"artistic finesse\\". The plant life backgrounds of this engraving were done by Audubon's assistants and Joseph Mason but they are not credited in the book.Burt, DeVere. \\"The Joseph Mason Project, Historic Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum\\". Ruthven.com website. Accessed 17 December 2015. The piece was created by shooting the owls and then painting them after Audubon set them into poses. He then directed the production of the printing plate based upon his painting. Audubon included details on the bird itself in his Ornithological Biographies. The Snowy Owl engraving was made by Robert Havell. The original prints were printed on J. Whatman watermarked paper. The border of the image is labelled \\"Snowy Owl (No. 25, Plate CXXI)\\" and \\"Strix Nyctea\\". On the lower left is written \\"Drawn from Nature by J. J. Audubon F.R.S.F.L.S.\\" \\"Engraved, Printed & Coloured by R.R.Havell, London\\" appears on the lower right. Background publication history This is a detailed and enlarged image of Audubon's engraving, Snowy Owl. It shows the details of the etching of the owl's foot. This is a detailed and enlarged image of Audubon's engraving, Snowy Owl. The original piece is life sized. It shows the details of the etching of the owl's feathers. Though Audubon typically used oil colours, for this piece he used watercolours and pastel crayons (and occasionally pencil, charcoal, chalk, gouache, and pen and ink). His first depiction of the snowy owl was done in pastels in 1809. The Snowy Owl was part of the original edition of The Birds of America (sometimes called the Havell Edition after its printer, and sometimes called the \\"Double Elephant Folio\\", because of its size). It was printed on handmade paper 39.5 inches tall by 28.5 inches wide (100.3 × 72.4 cm). The principal printing technique was copperplate etching, but engraving and aquatint were also used. Colourists applied each colour in an assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work).Rhodes, 2004, pp. 273, 389 He was able to sell the Snowy Owl engravings to his wealthy patrons as part of The Birds of America. Audubon described the snowy owl in his Ornithological Biographies, which he wrote with Scottish naturalist and ornithologist William MacGillivray. Part of his role as a naturalist was his examination of the stomach contents of owls. As was his habit, Audubon included his assessment of the owl's use as a food source. He stated that snowy owls were \\"not indelicate eating\\".  Critique  One art historian described the piece, as an image that depicts the owls as \\"...gazing directly into the eyes of the observer.\\" The owls stand out from their dark background, as a developing winter storm is seen behind them. Though Audubon depicted the birds perched on the branch of the tree, the owls do not typically use trees as perches since much of their hunting ground is tundra and lacks trees. The female bird is realistically displayed as being larger than the male.

She was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and has lived and taught early childhood education in Brooklyn, New York. Biography Baker was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois to an electrical engineer father and mother who worked for the EPA. She grew up around positive Black male and female role models, but also experienced racism while growing up. She said in an interview: \\"I remember so clearly, when I was 5 years old, my mother, my brother and I were chased out of a Chicago neighborhood called Bridgeport when we were young. A gang of boys were waiting for us as we walked out of this church, and they started chasing us with bats and bricks yelling, 'Nigger go home! Baker studied film at Columbia College in Chicago, Illinois, and later founded production company Shoot Films Not People. Her films have been shown at film festivals. She has also worked as a Special Education preschool teacher in Brooklyn, New York. Baker stated in an article on Patch.com that she creates films to begin the healing process for Black men and women, and for society. Two of her films- Afraid of Dark and Silence: In search of Black Female Sexuality in America- have focused on undoing stereotypes of Black men and women. Baker is best known for Silence: In Search of Black Female Sexuality in America. In this film she interviewed Nzingha Steward and Little X, two directors in the Black music video industry. During the interview they discuss the impact of the 'video hoe' image on society. The film takes a journey into American history and slavery that unveils hidden sexual relations between enslaved Africans and slave owners. The film educates the public to the historical and contemporary racial tensions and injustices in America in regards to Black males. Baker shares her experiences, and interviews black males from all walks of life spanning three generations.

The charity does this by creating spaces for dialogue across communities and generations, and by providing young people, particularly those who are socially excluded, with the tools to lead change within society. MLMS won the UK Government's 2018 National Democracy Change Makers award which recognises an organisation that has put forward a new idea to increase access to democracy, convinced others of the merit of their idea, and affected a real change that benefits the greater good. MLMS has proven its ability to influence policy and empower young people across the UK and Europe. It has garnered the praise of the UK Government, Mayor of London, European Commission and European Parliament. This is because MLMS has gained a unique understanding of how to engage with “hard to reach” communities and to revolutionise their approach to electoral participation. MLMS are also proud members of the UK Government's National Democracy Council helping advise the Cabinet Office on their democratic engagement strategy. To date, MLMS has worked with over 41,000 young people directly and thousands more indirectly. MLMS is the secretariat for the All-Party Parliamentary Group for a Better Brexit for Young People (APPG-BBYP) that is chaired by Stephen Kinnock MP and was widely recognised as a significant driver of youth engagement in the increase of turnout for young people in the 2017 and 2019 UK General Elections.  Democracy Cafés  MLMS is best known for its Democracy Café engagement method. The charity has re-invigorated the 17th-century tradition of communities coming together in local coffeehouses to discuss regional, national and international issues. By using a more youth-friendly environment such as Starbucks, MLMS creates a safe space for young people to express themselves and to discuss their opinions on matters that affect them. MLMS, working together with partner organisations, has hosted more than 100 events in coffee shops across the UK and Europe. These events brought together diverse members of the local community who do not usually interact with each other, to discuss the most pressing issues of the day, as well as possible solutions. This model brings a social buzz back to coffee shops and makes them a place where communities can come together and engage in meaningful discussions. Working together with the London School of Economics, MLMS has developed a research methodology for these events to ensure that they are more than just a \\"talking shop\\" and the charity is able to gather invaluable insight to help support decision-making. All of the information they gather at their Café events feeds into their All-Party Parliamentary Group. The findings of certain issues and concerns presented during the cafes are then able to gain traction in Parliament where alongside decision-makers, MLMS can help to make policy recommendations based on the information the charity collects through its APPG.  Common Futures Forum  The Common Futures Forum (CFF) is held at the end of each year whereby each of the Democracy Café attendees are invited to London for a full day of events and discussion. Initially launched by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in 2018, the Forum “aims to inspire, empower and connect young and socially excluded citizens to lead change, by providing them with the platform to shape society”. During the event, speakers are invited to explain their areas of expertise before engaging in a question-and- answer session with an event host. The day also includes lab sessions which test new ways of democratic engagement, encourage debates, and tools of productive discussion by hosting a panel of speakers in conversation with the audience about select topics. The CFF in 2019 gathered social influencers such as Gina Martin who worked to make upskirting illegal and leaders of the technology sector such as Jurgen Maier to address the future world of work. Other speakers such as Lord Simon Woolley were invited to discuss the importance of youth engagement and leadership moving forward. The organisation’s new Young Leaders 2020 initiative will use the months leading up to the CFF to train and directly involve young ambassadors across the UK to facilitate the end of year event.  Advocacy  MLMS seeks to represent the views of young people to stakeholders and decision-makers at a local, national and international level. This work is based on the inception of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on a Better Brexit for Young People (BBYP), which acts as an engagement platform between young people and decision-makers to ensure that youth voice is at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. The APPG’s purpose is to involve young people in the Brexit negotiation process. The turnout among young people aged 18 to 24 in the EU referendum was almost double the level that has been widely reported since polling day, according to evidence compiled at the London School of Economics. MLMS' Parliamentary privileges afforded by the APPG allows the charity to feed its events, such as Democracy Cafés, into the decision-making process and by doing so they can achieve tangible policy outcomes. This is demonstrated in MLMS' report, titled UK Youth Perspectives and Priorities for the Brexit Negotiations, which was released in October 2017. MLMS recently implemented a new strategy to engage young people in democracy. This strategy is the Young Leaders 2020 programme which selects 20 people between the ages of 16-25 across the United Kingdom to be trained by a dozen of the organisation’s sponsors and affiliates. The training ranges from public speaking and leadership to stakeholder management and community organising. The hope of this programme is to have a mutually beneficial relationship with the nation’s young people who wish to not only be at the forefront of their community’s most pressing political issues, but to boost their resume and jump into their work experience.  Voter registration  MLMS has been campaigning to push voter registrations amongst 18-24 year olds since the snap election was called in 2017. Over 200,000 (of 308,000) people under the age of 35 registered to vote in the single day of November 22, 2019. My Life My Say’s CEO, Mete Coban spoke about the importance of this vote saying: “This is the defining election for our generation. We are talking about making a decision with Brexit that is going to affect the direction the country goes in maybe for the whole of young people’s lives”. The Vote For Your Future (VFYF) campaign sent out teams of voting advocates including those representing My Life My Say on the final day of registration to encourage young people to have their say in the election In continuation of this initiative, MLMS also invited young people to the Common Futures Forum in November 2019 where debates, panel discussions and speakers presented their expertise on topics from artificial intelligence, upskirting and social influencing.  Petitions  MLMS uses public petitions as a way to champion young people’s voices. Till date, the charity has launched three petitions which have received over 888,000 signatures calling on the Government to act in the best interests of young people. These petitions included one directed to Theresa May, demanding answers about the public’s confusion in the Brexit negotiations, two years after it was first announced. The other two petitions My Life My Say began were directed to Boris Johnson. One asking for a definitive ruling out of a no-deal Brexit before officially leaving the EU. The other requesting Johnson not to shut down Parliament in the hopes of avoiding the Government “to ram through an undemocratic Brexit” purely for the sake of putting an end to the drawn-out discussions. Listen Up! Campaign: MLMS was involved in the initiative of raising signatures from 50 MPs promising to have discussions with 20 young constituents about Brexit. Stephen Kinnock MP spoke of the campaign: “Our duty as elected representatives of the people is yes, to exercise our own judgement but we should only do that having taken account of the views and priorities and concerns and hopes and fears of our constituents” .  Creation of MLMS  Cllr Mete Coban MBE co-founded My Life My Say (MLMS) in 2013. He is most credited for setting up the All-Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People and contributing to the increase of youth voter registration in the UK 2017 General Election through the national #TurnUp campaign. At the age of 21, Mete was elected as the youngest ever Councillor in the London borough of Hackney for Stoke Newington. He currently serves as the Vice Chair of the Working in Hackney scrutiny commission.

It was originally published in early 1990s, authored by As'ad Humam and a team known as \\"Team Tadarus AMM\\". Iqro is a stepping-stone for reading the Quran in its original Arabic, given that these countries do not use Arabic outside religious contexts. The book was offered as an alternative to the older \\"Traditional\\" or \\"Baghdadi\\" method, and emphasizes the student's active role in learning. It is divided into six volumes (often sold as one physical book), each introducing Arabic letter shapes and sounds with increasing difficulty. The higher volumes also introduced elementary tajwid rules, or pronunciation rules for reciting the Quran.  Background  Indonesia has a majority Muslim population, but the population is not Arabic-speaking and the Arabic letters are not usually used except in religious contexts. Therefore, to read the Quran in the original Arabic, Indonesian Muslims must learn Arabic letters and the pronunciations. Some Arabic phonemes (such as for ث) do not appear in Indonesian languages and take training to pronounce correctly. In addition, students must also learn a special set pronunciation rules for Quranic recitation known as the tajwid. Prior to the popularity of Iqro, many taught Quranic reading using a method known as the \\"traditional\\" or \\"Baghdadi\\" method, which is still used today although to lesser extent. This method uses a textbook called Qa'ida Baghdadiyya ma' Juz Amma, and uses a technique to spell out each letter and vowel markings in local languages before pronouncing a complete word (e.g. \\"nun given a mark on top: 'na'\\"). This method also emphasizes teacher-student relationship at a personal level.  Content  A page from the second volume of the book (called \\"Iqro 2\\"). The new lessons in this page—how certain Arabic letters are written in non-isolated forms—are introduced on top. The rest of the page allows practice with this new lesson, as well as the previous lessons such as letters in isolation. The Iqro book consists of six volumes, sometimes sold separately in different colors and sometimes bound together as one physical book. Each volume began with a teaching instruction. Pages in the book often contain notations on the top introducing a new lesson (e.g. how a particular Arabic consonant assimilates). Instructions in the Indonesian language with the voice of an instruction (e.g. \\"Be careful!\\", \\"Go slow here!\\") often punctuate the content. Compared to the traditional method with emphasizes teacher-student relationship, the Iqro method was designed to allow for more independent learning. Teachers are expected to give only minimum instruction and then passively listen to the students' recitation. The six volumes are in increasing level of difficulty. Volume one introduces each letter in the Arabic alphabet in its isolated form and fathah (-a) vowel. The second volume introduces the non-isolated forms (initial, medial, and final) still in fathah. The third volume introduces the kasrah (-i) and dammah (-u) vowels. Volume four introduces tanwin (nunation), sukun (non-vocalized consonant) and qalqalah (consonants with reduced vowel). Volume five introduces various forms of alif lam (Arabic definite article) as well as the tajwid rule (Quranic recitation rule) of idgham (merging). The last volume—the sixth—introduces the tajwid rules of iqlab (conversion) and ikhfa' (concealment), as well as the waqf (pausing rules).  Development  The Iqro method was originated by As'ad Humam (1933–1996), a kyai and merchant from Yogyakarta and developed by a team calling themselves Team Tadarus AMM, also in Yogyakarta. The book was first published in the early 1990s, but according to Team Tadarus AMM, the history began earlier. In 1953, a Quranic teaching group was established using a traditional teaching method called the Baghdadi method. In 1973, As'ad Humam began discussions at his home on challenges faced in teaching the reading of Quran. Team Tadarus AMM was then established and subsequently developed reports on teaching conditions. Among others, the team reported that the current teaching methodologies were not sufficient. The team then experimented with new teaching methodologies, and developed a new system, which spread to other cities in Java. In 1988, the team received recognition from the provincial Ministry of Religious Affair bureau. By 1992, the Iqro books were sold throughout the country. The proliferation of the books were combined with the establishment of a schooling system known as Taman Pendidikan Al-Quran (\\"Quranic kindegartens\\", TPA). The TPAs were initially organized in local mosques sponsored by local initiators. Eventually, the local schools came under the umbrella of a semi-official confederation known as the \\"Organizing Body for the Youth Groups of Indonesian Mosques\\" (Indonesian acronym: BKPRMI). The BKPRMI trained TPA teachers on the Iqro method and materials. The Iqro method spread rapidly and became very popular throughout Indonesia. The success was generally attributed to its students being able to learn faster than students using the traditional methods. At the same time, the Iqro method also spread to the neighboring Malaysia, and in 1994 the Malaysian government adopted it as an official method for teaching Quranic recitation in elementary schools. The Malaysian version of the book has slight variations from the original, for example, instructions in local language are given in Jawi script—a common practice in Malaysia for Islamic education books—rather than the Latin alphabet.  Uses  Iqro is one of the most popular textbooks for learning to read the Quran in Indonesia as well as other countries in Southeast Asia. Iqro is usually learned by kindergarten to early elementary school children, and often used in the designated recitational schools, seminaries such as pesantren or surau, or homeschooling for religious education. Recitation skill learned through Iqro is a competition material in the Quranic recitational contest Musabaqah Tilawatil Quran (MTQ).Pemkot Bogor Intensif Adakan Pelarihan Baca Tulis Alquran.

It is located in the county of Ahrweiler in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It rises north of the lake of Laacher See in the area of the village of Wassenach. Der Veitskopf is the cinder cone of a volcano that erupted during the Quaternary period. Because there are no reference strata, its age cannot be accurately estimated. The Veitskopf produced three lava flows, of which the first and easily the largest spread out northwards from the crater rim in the west. Because the neighbouring valley, the Gleeser Tal, was formed after the eruption of the Veitskopf, this lava flow stands above the present valley and forms the so-called Mauerley. The two lava streams that run in a southerly direction are nowhere near as large and were first identified from magnetic surveys because they were covered by a layer of pumice. At the top of the Veitskopf is the Lydia Tower which enables an all-round view that includes the Laacher See, the Brohltal valley and even the Siebengebirge hills.  Footnotes and references  The name and height of the hill differs on the different maps produced by the Conservation Office of Rhineland-Palatinate. On the DTK 1:5,000 scale map it is called the Feithskopf and its height is given as m hoch, on the DTK 1:25,000 scale map it is called the Veitskopf and its height is shown as m.

History =Six Flags Magic Mountain= Three Giant Inverted Boomerang coasters, all named Déjà Vu, were slated to open for the start of the 2001 season at three Six Flags parks. However, sudden errors and malfunctions occurred during testing and caused the openings to be delayed. The first version of Déjà Vu to open was at Six Flags Magic Mountain on August 25, 2001.

Desperate for a break (and missing the \\"simpler Christmas\\" of her past), Jennifer takes a spur of the moment vacation at a mountain chalet in Colorado. However, on her way to the chalet she gets lost and swerves off the road. Dazed and confused, she stumbles into the road, where she is nearly hit by John Blake, a struggling veterinarian from nearby North Creek and a widower with three children who is still grieving over the loss of his wife. The accident leaves Jennifer with retrograde amnesia, unable to remember anything about her past. John and his family take her in, while Jennifer (now going by the name Maggie) recovers and John attempts to locate anyone who may know her. While recovering, John and Maggie begin to develop feelings for each other and she finds the simpler Christmas she once knew. Ultimately someone recognizes Maggie as Jennifer, and contacts Paula, Jennifer's friend at the network. Paula and Brad, Jennifer's boyfriend, come to North Creek to take her home. But back in New York City, Jennifer realizes that she's unhappy in the big city and misses John; she leaves Brad and her show behind to return to North Creek.

This interdisciplinary project is divided into three sections: the first examines adoption in the US, with a focus on African American, Native, and poor mothers and families; the second looks at transnational adoption in Latin America against a background of US intervention; and the third looks at contemporary reproductive politics, with a focus on immigrant mothers and gay and lesbian adoptive parents. As such, it situates the phenomenon of adoption within complex power dynamics and legacies of violence.Sharron, Kelly and Abraham Weil. “Somebody\`s Children: A Conversation with Laura Briggs.” The Feminist Wire (14 May 2013) http://www.thefeministwire.com/2013/05/somebodys-children-a-conversation-with- laura-briggs/ (Accessed 3 December 2017).

Sara Dorow writes that \\"by viewing political history through the lens of adoption, Somebody’s Children turns conventional methodologies of adoption inside out\\" and \\"makes a significant contribution to a growing body of scholarship that recognizes that the story of struggles over kinship is also the story of institutional and international configurations of power and of raced, classed, and gendered productions of subjectivity.\\" Dorow, Sara. \\"Adoption as Political History.\\" Reviews in American History, Volume 41, Number 1 (March 2013) p. 169. Somebody's Children has been included on numerous syllabi for courses in reproductive politics and women and globalization.

Dust jacket, How All Politics Became Reproductive Politics: From Welfare Reform to Foreclosure to Trump. The book centers around the relationship of reproductive politics to policy and public discourse within the last few decades, arguing that \\"what happens in our public policy is living also in our households.\\" Carrie Baker interview with Laura Briggs. “Breaking Down How All Politics Became Reproductive Politics.” Ms. Magazine blog. http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/11/07/breaking-politics-became-reproductive- politics/ (Accessed December 3, 2017). Briggs writes, “The massive changes in the economy since the late 1970s—stagnant real wages, shrinking government support for everything from schools to roads to welfare, ‘personal responsibility’ and ‘moral hazard’ as the reasons for vast public policy changes—were driven in significant part through a demonization of the reproductive labor of people understood to be women, particularly women of color, and all people who do care work.\\" By drawing connections between, among other things, the rise of neoliberalism and shifting discourses surrounding race and immigration, the regulatory function of reproductive technologies, and the cultural phenomena of welfare reform, gay marriage, and the subprime mortgage crisis, Briggs analyzes the factors that led to the Trump presidency and the current socio-economic state of the US. Rickie Solinger describes Briggs as \\"one of our most important thinkers and writers on the subject of reproductive politics\\" and writes that, \\"In this book, as in her previous work, Briggs offers us startlingly new ways of thinking about fundamental matters, while relying on a logic that makes her arguments feel utterly clear and correct.\\" Rickie Solinger.

It is the first overall episode of the series and is written by series creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. It aired on Fox in the United States on September 17, 2013. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the captain retires and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), is appointed. This puts a conflict between Jake and Holt due to their respective methods in the field. The pilot was watched by 6.17 million viewers, the most watched show on Fox that day and earned positive reviews from critics, who cited the performances and the setting as highlights. Plot NYPD detectives Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero) investigate a robbery at an electronics store. Despite his childish behavior, Peralta solves the crime when he discovers a teddy bear with a webcam filmed the entire event, and the robbers get arrested. Santiago disapproves of this, saying he just got \\"lucky\\" In the 99th precinct morning briefing, Sgt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) announces to the officers that a new captain is arriving at the precinct. This annoys Peralta, who had a keen relationship with the previous captain, an irresponsible person who let him do whatever he wanted. The new captain's arrival starts rough when Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) arrives exactly when Peralta is mocking him and then makes Peralta repeat every word using the same robotic voice. He tells Peralta to begin wearing a necktie, which Peralta disapproves of. Meanwhile, Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) wants to ask Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) out on a date, but his uncertainty at making choices disrupts his plans. Holt meets with Jeffords in order to be given a briefing on the precinct. He is informed about Diaz, a scary and tough detective; Boyle, a nervous and clumsy but honest and hardworking detective; Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti), an egomaniacal civilian administrator; Santiago, a hard-working and competitive detective; and Peralta, a childish yet extremely talented detective. Jeffords also notifies Holt that he is on administrative leave due to an incident a year ago. Holt learns that Peralta and Santiago are competing for the most crimes solved; if Santiago wins, she will get Peralta's car; and if Peralta wins, Santiago will go on a date with him. Gina outlines the seriousness of this bet to them, and Sarge explains how it has boosted their arrest numbers. The detectives are working on the murder of Henry Morgenthau, a luxury food importer who was killed in his apartment. Peralta and Boyle interrogate a butcher named Ratko (Nick Gracer) who could be involved in the crime, but he escapes. Due to his actions, Peralta is assigned to the records room. There, he finds new evidence against Ratko, who usually spends time in a storage unit in Boerum Hill. The detectives arrange a raid on the storage unit. While waiting in the car, Holt reveals to Peralta that he is gay. Ratko enters the storage facility, and the team divides up to find him. They manage to catch Ratko before he escapes again, and finally, the day is saved! Production =Development= On May 8, 2013, Fox placed a thirteen- episode order for the single-camera ensemble comedy. The exterior view of the fictional 99th Precinct building, complete with numerous NYPD vehicles parked in front of it, is the actual 78th Precinct building at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Bergen Street, one block south of the Barclays Center and one block east of the Bergen Street station on the New York City Subway's . =Casting= Andy Samberg described the show as \\"It's stuff The Wire touched on a lot.\\" Samberg took days after being offered the role to sign on, explaining, \\"Well, I hadn't seen a script. And I just did seven years on SNL. There was no doubt in my mind I wanted to work with Mike and Dan and that I liked the premise of the show, but if it works, it will be years of my life.\\" Reception =Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Pilot\\" was seen by an estimated 6.17 million household viewers and gained a 2.6/8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 2.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 8 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Dads and The Mindy Project but behind New Girl, first on its timeslot and second for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind New Girl. =Critical reviews= \\"Pilot\\" received positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.9 out of 10 and wrote, \\"The pedigree attached is impressive, which may create some overly elevated expectations. Brooklyn Nine-Nine, like most freshman series, is still finding its bearings. The pilot is solid, but doesn’t serve-up non-stop, laugh-out- loud, hilarity. It's possible that the show will eventually deliver weekly doses of gut-busting comedy, but for now, it's unmanifested potential. The series opener offers a strong start, with good doses of humor, and engaging and entertaining characters, though. It's certainly worth tuning in for.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nines theme riffs on the Beastie Boys' 'Sabotage,' right before Adrock comes in with the first verse (everybody now, “I can’t stand it, I know you planned it...').

It is the 11th overall episode of the series and is written by series co-creator Dan Goor and directed by Jake Szymanski. It aired on Fox in the United States on December 3, 2013. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This puts a conflict between Peralta and Holt for their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Holt receives death threats and per protocol, Peralta is assigned as his guardian, much to his joy. However, the situation is worse than he thought. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.66 million household viewers and gained a 1.6/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Braugher's performance. Braugher was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in the episode. Plot During Christmas season, Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is informed by Deputy Chief Gerber (Mark Berry) that Holt (Andre Braugher) has received death threats and, due to security protocols, Peralta has been chosen to watch Holt, which requires him to control every move he makes. Peralta tricks Holt into going to a safe house, handcuffs him to himself, and then throws the key through a vent. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) sees a therapist for a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he can go back into the field. Despite showing no signs of right analysis, he checks himself out after an emergency resurfaces. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) visits the safe house after Holt secretly sends him a message to bring him to the precinct, and the three of them end up handcuffed together. After an investigation, Holt finds that the death threats came from a killer (Kirk Bovill) he pursued years ago and sets out to find him at a train station. The killer is arrested but shoots Boyle when he jumps in to save Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). The gang are notified that Boyle will recover soon.

Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.9 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nines 'Christmas' found a clever way to create a Yuletide backdrop without delivering another entirely holiday-themed episode so quickly after Thanksgiving. Holt's history as a hothead adds a nice new element to his relationship with Peralta. Though this was another strong and funny episode, it wasn't quite as hilarious as the previous few installments. Overall, another solid entry, though. Nothing says Christmas cheer like coming together to combat death threats.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Christmas' may not have been my favorite entry so far, but it's a good marker as a midway point. It highlights what's great about the series—a game ensemble who gelled early in the series' life — and what doesn't work so well—a lead who is still not as compelling or as much fun to watch as everyone else around him. But if Holt can change from the Afro'd over -emoter to the stoic center of the Nine-Nine, maybe there's hope for Peralta yet.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"So I spent a lot of the A-story feeling the same way I did with some of those earlier episodes: wishing we would quickly get back to the other supporting characters. And that stuff was fun, whether Terry struggling with his fears in front of the shrink, Santiago scheming to get Diaz to smile or Boyle worrying about his flight, and then getting to play hero in an amazing and yet embarrassing way. Holt pop-and-locking in and of itself made this one a must-see, but I think the episode could have been a lot more.\\" Aaron Channon of Paste gave the episode a 7.3 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Unfortunately, this accounts for the meat of the episode, and it is largely unentertaining save for a few scattered Sambergisms and Braugherisms. It is true that the uncapitalized-upon potential in this scenario is a minor failure by the writers, but more significantly it shows how much the success of the series thus far has come to rely on the supporting cast. Where 'Thanksgiving' excelled by placing the entire cast together in one room, 'Christmas' fails by separating the detectives of the nine-nine into three separate arcs.\\" References External links 2013 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 1) episodes Christmas television episodes ","title":"Christmas (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"55941193","text":"\\"Captain Peralta\\" is the eighteenth episode of the second season of the American television police sitcom series Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

Let be the base field, be an automorphic form over , be the representation associated via the Jacquet–Langlands correspondence with . Goro Shimura (1976) proved this formula, when k = mathbb{Q} and is a cusp form; Günter Harder made the same discovery at the same time in an unpublished paper. Marie-France Vignéras (1980) proved this formula, when {k = mathbb{Q} and is a newform. Jean-Loup Waldspurger, for whom the formula is named, reproved and generalized the result of Vignéras in 1985 via a totally different method which was widely used thereafter by mathematicians to prove similar formulas. Statement Let k be a number field, mathbb{A} be its adele ring, k^times be the subgroup of invertible elements of k, mathbb{A}^times be the subgroup of the invertible elements of mathbb{A}, chi, chi_1, chi_2 be three quadratic characters over mathbb{A}^times/k^times, G = SL_2(k), mathcal{A}(G) be the space of all cusp forms over G(k)backslash G(mathbb{A}), mathcal{H} be the Hecke algebra of G(mathbb{A}). Assume that, pi is an admissible irreducible representation from G(mathbb{A}) to mathcal{A}(G), the central character of π is trivial, pi_ u sim pi[h_ u] when u is an archimedean place, {A} is a subspace of {mathcal{A}(G)} such that pi_mathcal{H} : mathcal{H} to A. We suppose further that, varepsilon(piotimeschi, 1/2) is the Langlands varepsilon-constant [ ; ] associated to pi and chi at s = 1/2 . There is a {gamma in k^times} such that k(chi) = k( sqrt{gamma} ) . Definition 1. The Legendre symbol left(frac{chi}{pi}right) = varepsilon(piotimeschi, 1/2) cdot varepsilon(pi, 1/2) cdot chi(-1). * Comment. Because all the terms in the right either have value +1, or have value −1, the term in the left can only take value in the set {+1, −1}. Definition 2. Let {D_chi} be the discriminant of chi. p(chi) = D_chi^{1/2} sum_{ utext{ archimedean}} leftvert gamma_ u rightvert_ u^{h_ u/2}. Definition 3. Let f_0, f_1 in A. b(f_0, f_1) = int_{xin k^times} f_0(x) cdot overline{f_1(x)} , dx. Definition 4. Let {T} be a maximal torus of {G}, {Z} be the center of {G}, varphi in A. beta (varphi, T) = int_{t in Zbackslash T} b(pi (t)varphi, varphi) , dt . * Comment. It is not obvious though, that the function beta is a generalization of the Gauss sum. Let K be a field such that k(pi)subset Ksubsetmathbb{C}. One can choose a K-subspace{A^0} of A such that (i) A = A^0 otimes_Kmathbb{C}; (ii) (A^0)^{pi(G)} = A^0. De facto, there is only one such A^0 modulo homothety. Let T_1, T_2 be two maximal tori of G such that chi_{T_1} = chi_1 and chi_{T_2} = chi_2. We can choose two elements varphi_1, varphi_2 of A^0 such that beta(varphi_1, T_1) eq 0 and beta(varphi_2, T_2) eq 0. Definition 5. Let D_1, D_2 be the discriminants of chi_1, chi_2. : p(pi, chi_1, chi_2) = D_1^{-1/2} D_2^{1/2} L(chi_1, 1)^{-1} L(chi_2, 1) L(piotimeschi_1, 1/2) L(piotimeschi_2, 1/2)^{-1} beta(varphi_1, T_1)^{-1} beta(varphi_2, T_2). * Comment. When the chi_1 = chi_2, the right hand side of Definition 5 becomes trivial. We take Sigma_f to be the set {all the finite k-places u mid  pi_ u doesn't map non-zero vectors invariant under the action of {GL_2(k_ u)} to zero}, {Sigma_s} to be the set of { all k-places u mid u is real, or finite and special }. Theorem [ , Thm 4, p. 235 ]. Let k = mathbb{Q} . We assume that, (i) L(piotimeschi_2, 1/2) eq 0; (ii) for u in Sigma_s, left(frac{chi_{1, u}} {pi_ u}right) = left(frac{chi_{2, u}} {pi_ u}right) . Then, there is a constant {q in mathbb{Q}(pi)} such that : L(piotimeschi_1, 1/2) L(piotimeschi_2, 1/2)^{-1} = q p(chi_1) p(chi_2)^{-1} prod_{ u in Sigma_f} p(pi_ u, chi_{1, u}, chi_{2, u}) Comments: * (i) The formula in the theorem is the well-known Waldspurger formula. It is of global-local nature, in the left with a global part, in the right with a local part. By 2017, mathematicians often call it the classic Waldspurger's formula. * (ii) It is worthwhile to notice that, when the two characters are equal, the formula can be greatly simplified. * (iii) [ , Thm 6, p. 241 ] When one of the two characters is {1}, Waldspurger's formula becomes much more simple. Without loss of generality, we can assume that, chi_1 = chi and chi_2 = 1. Then, there is an element { q in mathbb{Q}(pi) } such that L(piotimeschi, 1/2) L(pi, 1/2)^{-1} = q D_{chi}^{1/2}.

A thermal hysteresis-producing xylomannan glycolipid antifreeze associated with cold tolerance is found in diverse taxa. Journal of Comparative Physiology 181:631-640  Characteristics  The beetles are between 10–14 mm in length,. Their body tends to be strongly dorsoventrally flattened and their sides parallel. Their abdomen has 5 visible ventral segments. These have strongly forked median process at abdominal apex. These beetles are bright or dull red in colour. The adult have triangular shaped heads and black antenna.  Special adaptations  The cold temperature in the temperate and polar USA and Canada makes survival challenging for an organism like C. clavipes. These beetles have evolved physiological adaptations to persist. Many studies of insects and some invertebrates have indicated a correlation between dehydration and the organism’s ability to prevent freezing. C. clavipes has evolved to have this ability of going through extreme dehydration, producing anti-freeze proteins (AFPs) and anti-freeze glycolipids (AFGL), entering into a diapause, producing a multimolar concentration glycerundol, and purging the gut in order to remove potential ice nucleators. Absence of freezing indicates that their AFPs can inhibit ice nucleators to vary in low temperatures and may inhibit homogenous nucleation resulting in vitrification. Another study reported that if temperatures were held constant, then C. clavipes individuals with the highest water content had the highest probability of freezing, and individuals with the lowest water content had the lowest probability of freezing.Sformo, T., J. McIntyre, K. R. Walters Jr., B. M. Barnes and J. Duman. 2011. The probability of freezing in the freeze-avoiding beetle larvae Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) from interior Alaska. Journal of Insect Physiology 57:1170-1177 AFPs decrease the temperature at which an ice crystal grows, defined as the hysteretic freezing point, by an average of 2–5 °C below the melting point in insects, which can be as much as 13 °C in C. clavipes in winter when the insect is dehydrated and the AFPs concentrated.Duman, J. G, and M. J. Wisniewski. 2014. The use of antifreeze proteins for frost protection in sensitive crop plants. Environmental and Experimental Botany 106:60-69 The Alpha S1 and S2 caesin precursor proteins are thought to have roles in the inhibition of formation of ice nucleators in C. clavipes. The beetle can also be freeze tolerant during a given year based on previous determinations of freeze tolerance in former years and that a strong correlation exists between its supercooling point (SCP) and the lower lethal temperature.Ditruch, T., and V.

While there are a railroad and the modern highway contiguous with the site, they are not part of the Historic designation. History The first use of the route during historic times was by hunters, trappers, and American Indians. While American Indians most likely used the route back through pre-historic times, European settlers first began using it during the 1830s and 1840s, with the incursions made by traders and hunter/trappers. With its acquisition of what is today Arizona from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers began an official survey of the area, which was followed in 1851 by exploration of the area by Lorenzo Sitgreaves on his exploration tour between New Mexico and California. As part of a sequence of six surveys for a transcontinental railway, the route was surveyed in 1853-54 by Amiel Weeks Whipple, who completed the first complete, detailed examination of the route. From between August 1857 to January 1858, Edward Fitzgerald Beale was in charge of developing a wagon route, along the route laid out by Whipple 3 years earlier. In addition to being the event which established the wagon trail, Beale's expedition was notable for its use of camels. This was so novel that the route became known as the \\"Beale Camel Trail\\". By the 1880s the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad had constructed its western division for their intercontinental rail line, paralleling this wagon route. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway took over this stretch of track in the 1890s. Absorbed by the Sante Fe Railway, which today is part of the BNSF Railway, this section of rail is part of their main transcontinental line. With the arrival of automobiles in the early 20th century, the wagon trail evolved into what became U.S. Route 66, and eventually Interstate 40, although not on exactly the same exact route. Some original sections of the original wagon road remain intact within the Petrified Forest National Park. Neither the rail nor highway is part of the National Historic Site. There are no physical structures or buildings within the site.National Park Service 1977, p. 8:2. Description The route travels along a path about one mile south of the Painted Desert rim. The extant traces of the route enters the Petrified Forest National Park at Navajo Springs, Arizona in the east, traveling in a generally southwest direction for about six miles before it exists the park on its southern boundary. Just outside the site are the ruins of a wagon station which sits alongside Lithodendron Wash. The remnants of the wagon road can be seen as eroded tracks which were cut by the animals and iron-rimmed wheels of wagons and stagecoaches which traversed the trail during the latter half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.National Park Service 1977, p. 9:1.

In 1983, the owners of the business decided to transfer ownership of the store to two separate non-profit organizations; the Coopérative La Cordée and La Fondation scoute La Cordée. In 2001, the company expanded its operations with a second store in Laval. A third store opened in 2005 on the South Shore of Montréal, in Saint-Hubert. In 2015, La Cordée acquired Le Yeti, another small outdoor product retailer on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, which they renamed La Cordée Boutique. In 2018, in an effort to expend outside Greater Montreal, La Cordée acquired La Vie Sportive, a well-established outdoor product retailer in Quebec City. In 2019, the workers of the two stores located in Montreal decided to unionized with the Commercial Federation of CSN . This unionization is historical being the first among the sports and outdoor retailers of Quebec .  La Cordée and the Montreal scouts  When La Cordée opened as a cooperative in 1953, its mission was to provide Montreal's scout troops with uniforms and outdoor equipment at an affordable price. Since 1983, La Cordée has been operated as an incorporated business that donates all its profits to one of its shareholders, La Fondation scoute La Cordée. To this day, more than 4 million dollars have been donated to the organization. After all these years, La Cordée is still the official counter of Montreal's scouts.

It is an agricultural pest of corn and tomato. Description A long lived species, the dusky sap beetle can live as an adult for up to 300 days. Measuring 3.3-4.5 mm, this large bodied beetle is primarily brown, but has orange colouration on its elytra. Depressions can be see on each side of the pygidium, which is a characteristic of males. Additionally, the genital capsule, which is quite distinct, can not be seen from an overhead view. Eggs produced by adults are milk coloured white and oval in shape. Similarly, the larvae can be white, or yellow in body colour with a brown head. This image, taken from Marini 2013, can provide a better look at the adult morphology and colouration. Habitat Like other sap beetles, fruit secretions are the primary food source, but they will also consume fungi, decomposing fruit and even pollen. C. lugubris is capable of feeding on undamaged fruits as well, corn being its primary food source. The species is long lived, so they will take up shelter in adverse environmental conditions. One such refuge is the bottom of bee creates, which are often closely located to crops. Going underground during the pupa and adult stages allows them to survive the winter. Larva and adults will often have overlapping niches, with the larva developing on the ears of the corn and eventually feeding on the kernels. Distribution Native to North America, C. lugubris can be found throughout southern Canada, the United States, and as far as South America. Reports have even indicated its spread to southern European countries, such as, Italy. Only very cold climatic regions are free of the genus Carpophilus.Bartelt, R, J. Hossain, M, S. (2010) Chemical ecology of Carpophilus sap beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and development of an environmentally friendly method of crop protection. Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews. 3 (1). Pp 29-61. Life Cycle Like the typical beetle life cycle, C. lugubris has four life stages. The egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Eggs are often laid on the silk of corn and have a generation time of 2–4 days. 3-5 eggs will be laid at a time and the optimal temperature is 21 °C. The larval stage begins feeding on corn kernels and undergoes 3-4 instars before entering the pupa stage. This stage will often last for roughly 3 weeks. When ready to pupate, the larva fall to the ground and bury themselves. This may last 9–10 days before reemerging, but it can be longer if overwintering becomes necessary. Once exiting from the ground, the adult will use pheromones to locate a new food source and possible mating location. Ecological Impacts Being capable of attacking undamaged fruits and vegetables makes the genus Carpophilus a large threat to economic crops. C. lugubris, is a common pest of corn in North America, but tomato plants are also at risk. Larva present in corn kernels often go undiscovered and this can lead to their rejection and subsequent discarding. They can also act as vectors for fungi transfer to crop plants. Related species act as vectors for disease, such as Oak Wilt. The ability to disperse via flight gives this genus great potential for disease transfer. A related species is known to be parasitic to honey bee hives, in which they burrow into the hive and predate the larva. The use of the dusky sap beetle to fight fungal infections is a possibility as well.Cooke, L. (1994) Insect drafted to fight fungus it spreads. Agricultural Research 42 (7). Pp 13. Management Insecticides are not often applied in direct response to C. lugubris, but they are still effective when targeting other species. A more effect approach is to ensure that crops are not left unharvested, as these plants will provide food for overwintering individuals. The use of pheromones by Carpophilus species has influenced traps and lures to protect crops. In Carpophilus sayi, pheromones from C. lugubris, are used to trick the species into believing a food source is nearby. Similarly, traps with fermenting fruit will be placed in crop locations and the capture rates are quite high. However, when crops begin to ripen, the traps are selected against. Methods involving the use of radio frequencies is a possible way of killing larva hidden in the fruit. Early corn planting, in North Carolina, has show to reduce the number of damaged plants, as opposed to later planted crops.

Born in Castelnaudary, France in 1588, he studied medicine in Montpellier, France. He became a practitioner of the iatrochemical medicine of Paracelsus. Beginning in 1610 he practiced medicine in Castelnaudary. He became famous as a specialist in the plague which was particularly severe in central Europe during the Thirty Years' War. Fabre prescribed chemical medications for the treatment of the plague and was at one time the private physician of King Louis XIII of France. Fabre was a practising alchemist, and claimed to have succeeded in the alchemical transmutation of lead into silver on 22 July 1627. He was strongly attracted to mystical aspects of chemistry, drawing parallels between the chemical operations of alchemy and the sacraments of the Christian church, particularly in his Alchymista Christianus (1632). He died in Castelnaudary on 9 January 1658.  _Alchymista Christianus_  \\"He saw valid correspondences between the sacraments and chemical operations: calcination symbolised penitence; fire and water corresponded to baptism; and the Philosopher's Stone could be compared to nothing less than the Eucharist. Assuming this, Fabre thought that true alchemists were like priests; the spirit of mercury was like the angels; the earth was like the Virgin Mary; and the life-giving properties of salt gave it a valid connection to Christ. These correspondences could be visualised because they were sculpted on the great churches of France, whose artist-architects had presented their esoteric knowledge to the viewer.\\" - A.G.

Some of these allegations are linked to the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations starting in October 2017. Executive branch =Donald Trump= :Stormy Daniels On January 12, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in October 2016, shortly before the presidential election, as hush money to deny having had an affair with Trump in 2006. The Wall Street Journal elaborated that the payment was done that month to a representative of Daniels via a private company established in Delaware by Cohen. At the time, Clifford was reportedly in talks to share her account with Good Morning America and Slate. Cohen has denied the existence of an affair on behalf of Trump; he also produced a letter allegedly signed by Daniels denying both the affair and the payment of hush money. On January 17, 2018, In Touch Weekly published excerpts of a 2011 interview of Daniels alleging a 2006 extramarital affair with Trump. The magazine describes her account as being supported by a polygraph and corroborated by both her friend and her ex-husband. The political watchdog group Common Cause filed a complaint on January 22, 2018, calling on the Federal Election Commission and U.S. Department of Justice to investigate if the reported payout violated campaign finance rules. In response to this complaint, Cohen said that he had given $130,000 to Daniels from his own pocket, that it was for matters unrelated to the Trump campaign or Trump Organization, and that he was not reimbursed for the payment. On August 21, 2018, Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Cohen, pleaded guilty to eight counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Two of them were related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Cohen entered his plea months after his office and hotel room were raided by the FBI. On December 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison. :Karen McDougal In February 2018, The New Yorkers Ronan Farrow wrote about an alleged affair between Trump and Playboy model Karen McDougal, as well as the \\"catch and kill\\" procedure of the purchase and withholding of the story by American Media, Inc. (AMI), largely corroborating a 2016 report in The Wall Street Journal, except that the affair had gone on for nine months. The story was based on McDougal's handwritten memoirs of the affair, which McDougal's friend passed to Farrow. McDougal confirmed to Farrow that she had written the memoirs. Farrow quotes the memoirs as stating that McDougal first met Trump in June 2006 at a party hosted by Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. Trump kept in contact with McDougal, and they had sex on the first date. During the affair, she met members of his family and he promised to buy her an apartment in New York. To avoid \\"paper trails\\", Trump had McDougal pay for flight and hotel expenses when she flew to meet him, then he reimbursed her. McDougal ended the affair in April 2007 due to guilt and being offended by some of Trump's comments. McDougal declined to discuss details of the alleged affair due to her agreement with AMI, but she told Farrow that she regretted signing that agreement, saying, \\"It took my rights away... I don't know what I'm allowed to talk about. I'm afraid to even mention his name.\\" Farrow also wrote that AMI CEO/Chairman David Pecker has a \\"favorite tactic\\" of buying \\"a story in order to bury it\\". AMI said it did not publish McDougal's story as it was not credible, and a spokesperson for the White House denied the affair. On March 22, 2018, McDougal was interviewed by Anderson Cooper on AC360 in which she detailed her alleged affair with Trump. In the interview McDougal said that Trump tried to give her money after they first had sex. She also stated that their relationship lasted ten months and that she visited Trump \\"many dozens of times\\". In March 2018, McDougal filed a lawsuit against American Media, Inc. in Los Angeles Superior Court, aiming to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement. On April 19, 2018, American Media, Inc. settled with McDougal; the settlement allows her to speak about the alleged affair. In July 2018, The New York Times reported that two months before the 2016 presidential election, Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had secretly recorded a conversation between him and Trump regarding paying McDougal. Another personal lawyer to Trump, Rudy Giuliani, said that Trump did not know of the recording, and gave two versions of the topic of conversation, saying firstly that the discussion was planning to pay McDougal directly, and secondly that it was about planning to pay American Media Inc. (AMI) for the rights to McDougal's story. This appeared to contradict a previous claim by Trump's campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks days before the election when she responded to the report by The Wall Street Journal about AMI's payment to McDougal that \\"we have no knowledge of any of this.\\" =Rob Porter= Porter resigned from the position of White House Staff Secretary on February 7, 2018, following public allegations of spousal abuse from his two ex-wives.Jonathan Swan.

She wrote that he \\"put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth ... I felt disgusted and violated.\\" Franken was also photographed appearing to grope her breasts while she was seated and sleeping on an aircraft wearing Interceptor Body Armor and a helmet. In response Franken said, \\"I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann ... As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it.\\" A few hours later, Franken issued a longer apology, which Tweeden accepted. Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer sent the information to the Senate Ethics Committee for review, a decision supported by members of both parties including Franken himself. The next day, Abby Honold, who had worked with Franken to introduce legislation that would provide training to law enforcement interviewing victims of trauma, requested that Franken withdraw his name as the sponsor of that bill. Honold was raped by a former Franken intern. Franken complied and Senator Amy Klobuchar took over the bill's sponsorship. On November 20, 2017, Lindsay Menz accused Franken of touching her clothed buttocks while the two posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. In a statement responding to the allegation, Franken said, \\"I take thousands of photos at the state fair surrounded by hundreds of people, and I certainly don't remember taking this picture. I feel badly that Ms. Menz came away from our interaction feeling disrespected.\\" Later, two more women accused Franken of similar misconduct during political events in 2007 and 2008, incidents Franken said he also did not remember. Some liberal groups and commentators, including the Indivisible movement and Sally Kohn, called on Franken to resign because of these allegations. Franken issued another apology on November 23, 2017, stating, \\"I've met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations. I'm a warm person; I hug people. I've learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many.\\" A fifth woman, Stephanie Kemplin, alleged Franken touched her breast while posing for a photo with her during a 2003 USO tour.

The book is written for children from 3 to 11. Summary The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water is a fable about a good natured lion. Editions The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water comes in several different versions: hardcover, softcover, and hardcover with a CD. The book is published in several different language including English and Spanish as well as several bilingual editions including English and Pashto and English and Dari. Reception The Michigan Department of Education selected this title as part of their statewide R.E.A.D.Y. (Read, Educate and Develop Youth), program designed to make sure children have the necessary pre-reading skills (language, vocabulary, alphabet) by the time they enter school. Dr. Denise Nessel reviewed The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water and The Silly Chicken for the November/December 2003 issue of Library Media Connection. Nessel said that \\"These stories, and others from this tradition, are not moralistic fables or parables, which aim to indoctrinate, nor are they written only to amuse. Rather, they are carefully designed to show effective ways of defining and responding to common life experiences. A story is an especially good means for this kind of communication because it works its way into consciousness in a way that direct instruction cannot do.\\" Dr. Nessel states specifically about the story that \\"With each rereading, the lion's predicament and his reaction to it become more familiar. This familiarity provides a base on which the child can come to understand egocentricity and irrationality at successive depths later in life.\\" Noorullah Babrakzai reviewed Shah's entire Children's Book Series which includes The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water for Volume 5 Number 2, 2003 (ISSN 1521-0960) issue of the Multicultural Perspectives. Babrakzai is Afghan who grew up hearing these stories notes that they \\"are vibrant, engaging, universal stories, not arid geography lessons ... .\\" She notes about the \\"Lion\\" that this tale \\"can teach children and adults valuable lessons about fear that unfold gradually, as one is ready for them.\\" Babrakzai notes that \\"it would be a mistake to view these tales as merely 'primitive' substitutes for more 'sophisticated' forms of entertainment. There lasting appeal is due, I think, to the fact that they not only entertain, but can be understood on many different levels and provide a form of \\"nourishment for the brain\\" that can help develop thinking abilities and perceptions.\\" She concludes that \\"These enchanting stories Shah has collected have a richness and depth not often encountered in children's literature, and their effect on minds young and old can be almost magical. It is for this reason, as much as for what they can teach us about an important but little-known culture, that they are a most worthy addition to any bookshelf.\\"  References  External links *Hoopoe Books - Read Together Manuals (in English and Spanish) *The Idries Shah Foundation *The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water Free Online Read Books by Idries Shah 1998 children's books ","title":"The Lion Who Saw Himself in the Water"},{"id":"55941702","text":"Roberto Massimo (born 12 October 2000) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward for VfB Stuttgart.

He shot a total of 14 enemy aircraft in the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. Following the end of the latter he tested dozens of new aircraft and set a new world flight airspeed record, for which he received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. His older brother Vladimir Kokkinaki followed a similar career path, also achieving the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Early life Konstantin Kokkinaki was born on 11 March 1910, in Novorossiysk into a Pontic Greek family. He left school in 1925 after finishing the 7th grade, going on to work as a sailor in the Novorossiysk port. In 1929, he voluntarily enlisted into the Red Army after answering the call of the central committee of Komsomol. In 1931, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1932, Kokkinaki graduated from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School. He went on to serve as a pilot in the Red Air Force, becoming a test pilot in 1939. Career On the same year Kokkinaki became a member of the Soviet Volunteer Group a unit of pilots fighting on the Chinese side in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Two squadrons of Polikarpov I-15 and Polikarpov I-16s assembled near Moscow, Stepan Suprun was appointed as their commander with Kokkinaki acting as his deputy. Once the planes reached Alma- Ata they were dismantled and loaded unto cars reaching China by traversing the Gobi Desert. The planes were reassembled at Hami and flown to Chongqing by way of Lanzhou. Kokkinaki's fighter squadron was tasked with defending the city from Japanese bombing raids until December when it was transferred to the south east of the country. On 10 January 1940, Kokkinaki shot down his seventh enemy aircraft. Soon afterwards his squadron returned to the Soviet Union, he remained in China in the capacity of a military advisor. During his time in China Kokkinaki flew 166 combat missions and was awarded a Chinese order. In June 1941, Kokkinaki was dispatched to the front lines of World War II. He served as the deputy commander of the 401st Special Fighter Regiment which was composed of former test pilots. Upon Suprun's death Kokkinaki assumed his position at the head of the regiment. During the course of the war Kokkinaki claimed three individual and four more shared take downs. Kokkinaki retired from the air force in 1950 in the rank of colonel. He continued to work as a test pilot, testing dozens of new aircraft. In 1960, he broke the world flight airspeed record. On 21 August 1964, Kokkinaki was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for his achievements as a test and fighter pilot. Other decorations included two Orders of the Red Banner, three Orders of Lenin, three Orders of the Patriotic War first class, two Orders of the Red Star and the title Honoured Test Pilot of the USSR. Kokkinaki died in Moscow on 4 March 1990. His older brother Vladimir Kokkinaki followed a similar career path, also achieving the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and breaking numerous world speed records as a pilot.

An RV Tauri variable, its light curve alternates between deep and shallow minima, varying its apparent magnitude from 9.1 to 12.4. From the period-luminosity relationship, it is estimated to be around 1.6 kpc (5200 light-years) from Earth. Gaia Data Release 2 gives a parallax of 0.2175 mas, corresponding to distance of about . RV Tauri variables like SX Centauri are supergiant pulsating stars and a subtype of the population II Cepheids. They are stars that have already passed the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and are in the last stage of their evolution before becoming a planetary nebula. This transition phase is very fast, and may last for less than a thousand years. SX Centauri is in the beginning of this process and is estimated to be leaving the AGB right now, or to have left the AGB a few decades ago. Its pulsations are radial in nature and have a period of about 32.9 days (from deep minimum to deep minimum), causing the effective temperature of the star to vary between 5,000 and 6,500 K and the radius between 21 and 29 solar radii. The radius seems to have the same value in both the primary and secondary minima, while the temperature shows a 500 K variation between minima. The spectrum of SX Centauri shows infrared excess, indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk of hot dust around the star. interferometric observations constrained the diameter of the disk to less than 11 arcseconds (18 AU at the star's distance), indicating a very compact system. The infrared emission is consistent with a hotter component (715 K) corresponding to 4% of the dust, and a colder one (244 K) corresponding to 96% of the dust. This material is composed mainly of amorphous carbon and graphite (83%), with the remainder being pyroxene and olivine. The disk is related to a depletion of refractory elements (with high condensation temperature) in the star's photosphere; this is caused by separation of gas from dust rich in refractories, followed by accretion of the gas by the star. SX Centauri is a spectroscopic binary, having a companion star with an orbital period of 592 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.16. This companion has a mass estimated between 1.4 and 1.9 solar masses and is probably an unevolved main sequence star. The system must have interacted in the past when the primary was a red giant, which is likely related to the formation of disk. All RV Tauri stars with dust disks are believed to be part of a binary system. Slow periodic variations in the mean brightness of SX Centauri have been detected, leading the star to be classified as an RV Tauri star of the photometric class b (RVb). The period of this variation is approximately equal to the orbital period of the system. This phenomenon can be explained as variation of the circumstellar extinction during the orbital motion of the disk.

With her partner, Gregorio Martínez Sierra, she worked on the creation of the pioneering Teatro de arte company at Madrid's Teatro Eslava between 1916 and 1926. She subsequently starred with several other high-profile theatre companies and also, during the 1930s, built a Hollywood career as a film actress.

In 1898, backed by the United States of America, Cuba ceased to be a Spanish colony. Around 1900 the family returned to their former home village of Santa María (Lebeña) in the mountains of northern Spain. When she was twenty she moved to Madrid where, helped by family contacts, she embarked on an acting career with the theatre company of María Guerrero, participating in a number of premiers including \\"El genio alegre\\" (\\"The cheerful genius\\" 1906) and \\"Amores y amoríos\\" (1908) by the Quintero brothers, as well as \\"La araña\\" (\\"The Spider\\" 1908) by Àngel Guimerà, \\"Las hijas del Cid\\" (\\"El Cid's daughters\\" 1908), \\"Doña María la Brava\\" (1909) and \\"En Flandes se ha puesto el sol\\" (\\"The sun has gone down in Flanders\\" 1910) - these last three by Eduardo Marquina. She was also in the cast for the premier performance of \\"La fuente amarga\\" (\\"The bitter fountain\\" 1910) by Manuel Linares Rivas. Soon after that she formed her own theatre company. More premiers followed, including \\"La losa de los sueños\\" (1911) by Jacinto Benavente and \\"Flor de los pazos\\" (1912) by Rivas. From 1916 the scene of her major triumphs was Madrid's Teatro Eslava where plays that she premiered included \\"No te ofendas, Beatriz\\" (1920) and \\"Chica del gato\\" (1921), both by Carlos Arniches. By 1916 Bárcena had teamed up with Gregorio Martínez Sierra, a playwright, publisher and stage director characterised by one source as \\"an even more unsuitable man\\". The partnership was both professional and personal. Eight years her senior, Martínez Sierra drew respect as a progressive playwright at a time when most of the dramatists writing for the Madrid theatre were unadventurous and conservative. Martínez Sierra was married to the feminist writer and activist, María Lejárraga, who was understood to help her husband with his plays: there are suggestions from some quarters that she wrote them. Lejárraga was disinclined to agree to a divorce, and while Martínez Sierra and Bárcena cohabited openly, his wife took to describing herself, just as openly, as her husband's widow. Bárcena introduced more works by Martínez Sierra to the Madrid stage, along with pieces by Benito Pérez Galdós and Jacinto Benavente. One of her lover's contributions to the Spanish stage was as a translator: Bárcena featured in premiers of important foreign plays such as Ibsen's Doll's House (1917) and Shaw's Pygmalion (1920). The partnership with Martínez Sierra also gave rise to a succession of further premiers of plays by a younger generation of Spanish writers during the 1920s. One was of \\"El maleficio de la mariposa\\" (\\"The Curse of the Butterfly\\"), generally identified as the first play by Federico García Lorca, in a production that used memorable costumes designed by Rafael Barradas. As early as 1916 Bárcena and Martínez Sierra were involving themselves in the newly popular genre of pantomime, blending the traditions of musical theatre and spoken stage works. In 1922 she gave birth to her daughter, Katia. The father of the infant was Martínez Sierra. It was partly to get away from the scandal generated by the illegitimate birth that in 1926 Catalina Bárcena embarked on a tour of South America. Costume and clothes were important to her, and she was accompanied by her wardrobe mistress, Antonia García. She was presumably well received by theatre audiences, since the South American tour lasted three years. By the time she returned to Madrid, commercial theatre was in crisis. The international cinema industry was undergoing traumas of its own, reflecting the switch from silent movies to \\"talkies\\". Bárcena had always sworn that she would have nothing to do with cinema, but in California the major studios were desperately confronting the reality that many of the top stars of the silent screen lacked the voice projection and other vocal talents appropriate for the new technologies. In 1927 she signed up with Fox, starring in a succession of Spanish language movies including versions of \\"Canción de cuna\\" and \\"The Merry widow\\". However, the Hollywood roles dried up during the later 1930s as younger Spanish-language stars appeared on the scene. During the Civil War she chose to go into exile, accompanying her sister María Luisa de la Cotera. Maria Luisa was married to a Catalan ship's captain whose father was Juan Antonio Molinas Soler, President of the Port of Barcelona, of the New Vulcano shipyards and of the \\"Association of Industrial Engineers\\" (\\"Asociación de Ingenieros Industriales\\"). Through his connections they were able to leave the country, apparently accompanied by Bárcena's lover, Gregorio Martínez Sierra, arriving at Oran and settling in Tétouan in 1936. Morocco was less brutally disrupted by the fighting than Spain itself. Nevertheless, Bárcena and Martínez Sierra did not long remain with her sister's family, preferring to make their ways at various stages in Marseilles, Paris and Buenos Aires where they remained for nearly a decade. The two of them went back to Madrid only in 1947. By this time Martínez Sierra was ill with cancer and he died a few weeks after their return. Bárcena was approaching conventional retirement age and there was no return to her pre-war stardom, but she remained actively engaged in the world of theatre. In 1948 she formed the \\"Compañía Cómico-Dramática Española\\" comic theatre company, with herself as its leading actress. The company had its debut at the Madrid Comedy Theatre (\\"Teatro de la Comedia\\") with \\"Pygmalion\\", followed in 1949 by another foreign play, \\"Fifty Years of Happiness\\". In 1954 they presented \\" Leyenda de una vida\\" (\\"Story of a life\\") at the city's Teatro Infanta Isabel. In 1971 or 1972 she received the National Theatre Prize. After she died in 1978, one of the most memorable epitaphs was penned by Lorca, by now himself something of a \\"grand old man\\" of the theatre, who dedicated a poem to her memory in which he recalled her voice as having \\"sounded like music and crystal\\" (\\"sonaba a música y cristal\\").  Personal  While working at the company of María Guerrero, Catalina Bárcena was noticed by Guerrero's loose-living husband, the actor Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Aguado. She christened their son Fernando. Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Aguado had sons by various women: they were all christened Fernando. Meanwhile, Catalina hastily married not her boss's husband, but a more junior actor in the company, called Ricardo Vargas. By 1916 the couple were evidently separated, although they were divorced only in 1932.

E. Leslie (born Annie Louise Brown). Brown began writing for the newspaper in 1919, held her first religious \\"Sunrise Service\\" (drawing approximately 50,000 people) on Belle Isle in 1934, and began a campaign to raise money to build a peace carillon on the island in 1936. Brown herself broke the ground for the carillon on October 30, 1939, and its cornerstone was laid on December 13 of that year. A notable backer of the project was John C. Lodge, a former mayor of Detroit and a member of the Detroit Common Council. The Nancy Brown Peace Carillon is octagonal in cross-sectional shape, in height, and located near the band shell on Belle Isle. Designed by the architectural firm of Harley, Ellington, and Day, the tower is neo-Gothic in design; according to the American Institute of Architects, its appearance is \\"at once stately and cheerfully unpretentious\\". The carillon was completed at a total cost of approximately $60,000; the money was raised entirely by donations from Brown's Detroit News readers and related fund-raisers, and the tower was completed without expense to the city. It was dedicated during the seventh annual Sunrise Service on June 16, 1940, which was attended by roughly 50,000 people. The first concert at the Nancy Brown Peace Carillon was held on Independence Day, July 4, 1940, and featured American patriotic music such as \\"America the Beautiful\\", the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\", and \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". The very last penny to cover the carillon's cost of construction was donated on December 7, 1941, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Brown continued writing her column, titled \\"Experience\\", until January 1942, and she retired from The Detroit News the following month. She died in Detroit on October 7, 1948, at the age of 77, and was buried at Oakview Cemetery in Royal Oak. The carillon was originally intended to feature bells, but because of their prohibitive cost, it was instead built with an organ and amplifier. By 1970, the carillon had ceased playing music due to damage caused by pigeons, while some of its stained-glass windows had been destroyed by vandalism. That year, while Detroit faced a $22.5 million deficit, then- current general superintendent of the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, John May, observed that \\"we haven’t got the money to repair it\\". In 1974, the Parks and Recreation Department voiced its hopes to replace the organ and amplifier with an 8-track system that would play recordings of carillon bells; at the same time, the Friends of Belle Isle endeavored to purchase and install real bells in the carillon, which would have cost approximately $100,000. New chimes were ultimately installed in the carillon in 2003. By 2012, the Nancy Brown Peace Carillon had been automated and was playing music daily. However, by 2013, local writer John Gallagher noted that the carillon had suffered from both neglect and vandalism for an extended period of time, and that it was in need of maintenance. In remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Detroit riot, an event entitled \\"67 Seconds of Peace\\" was held at the carillon in September 2017. It was led by Church of the Messiah pastor Barry Randolph and also featured a reading of \\"Poem for Belle Isle\\" by author Marsha Music as well as a presentation by historian Jamon Jordan.

He is best known for capturing a Spanish ship after being shipwrecked, though his story is possibly apocryphal. History Though supposedly a contemporary of L’Olonnais, no definitive dates are known for Bras-de-Fer's activities. He was described as preferring to sail alone on a fast, clean ship rather than as part of a pirate flotilla, and hand-picked his crew for their knowledge, and skill as well as their manners. He was also said to have instituted an early version of the Pirate Articles. He adopted his name “Bras-de-Fer” - translated as “Iron Arm” - as a pseudonym, a tactic used by a number of other buccaneers. In the story for which he is best known, his 100-man ship Phoenix was becalmed for a time off the Spanish Main before being caught in a sudden storm near Bocas del Dragón (between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago). Caught in a waterspout, the Phoenix was destroyed when lightning struck its gunpowder magazines. Bras-de-Fer and about twenty of the crew swam ashore to an island inhabited by hostile natives. They fought off the natives and waited until an armed Spanish merchant ship anchored offshore and sent parties inland looking for fresh water. Bras-de-Fer and his men ambushed and killed the Spanish shore party. Bras-de-Fer himself defeated the Spanish Captain in a furious sword fight. Now dressed in the Spaniards’ armor and uniforms, they returned to the ship and boarded, surprising the crew when they revealed their identities. They secured the richly-laden ship, marooned the surviving Spanish crew, and sailed away. Authenticity Bras-de-Fer's story is known from a single source, Alexandre Exquemelin’s History of the Buccaneers in America. Exquemelin accompanied a number of buccaneer expeditions and wrote from first- hand experience. His work was originally published in Dutch but was later translated into Spanish, French, German, English, and other languages. The translations frequently differ in content, dropping particular chapters and adding others, some “either plagiarized or completely invented.” The tale of Bras-de-Fer appears in the French edition (with other added material) but not in Exquemelin's original Dutch version: “Accounts of two other buccaneers, Montbars and Alexandre Bras-le-Fer, are inserted, but d'Ogeron's shipwreck on Porto Rico and the achievements of Admiral d'Estrees against the Dutch are omitted. In general the French editor, the Sieur de Frontignières, has re-cast the whole story.” In popular culture Two fictional novels about pirates, in which Alexandre Bras-de-Fer makes an appearance: *“Mortallone and Aunt Trinidad” by Arthur Quiller-Couch (1916) (full text available free online) *“The Buccaneer Chief: A Romance of the Spanish Main” by Gustave Aimard (2015) See also *Daniel Montbars – Another buccaneer whose story originally appears in Exquemelin's History.

History In pre-revolutionary Russia prostitution was regulated. After the Russian Revolution this system was abolished but prostitution continued. Any estimates of the extent of prostitution were hampered by the state's denial of its existence. In the work of criminologists Andrejs Vilks and Leonīds Tess, it was noted: The topic of prostitution in newspapers, journals and in contemporary writing was taboo. The rationale was that the publication of the existence of this phenomenon could undermine not only the moral and moral foundations of the country, but also significantly weaken the political authority of the country. =Pre-revolutionary Russia= Prior to Nicholas I, prostitution was banned by law, starting in 1649 when Alexei Mikhailovich ordered city burghers to watch \\"that there should not be harlots on the streets and lanes\\". Starting in 1843, the reign of Nicholas I, until 1908, there was a forced examination of prostitutes in the Russian Empire. There was no prohibition on engaging in prostitution before the revolution, but there was punishment for procuring and pimping. =The post-revolutionary period (1917–1928)= Immediately after the February Revolution, all aspects of police regulation of prostitution were abolished. The \\"sex workers\\" tried to create their own trade unions and defend their rights as other professions had done. The Soviet government, based on ideological ideas, pursued prostitutes as part of the \\"war communism\\".

Fedorov, 9.08.1918 // PSS, 5th ed., Vol. 50, p. 142). In 1919 a concentration camp of forced labour for women was created in Petrograd; 60% of its prisoners were women suspected of prostitution. At the same time attempts were made to socialise prostitutes as \\"victims of the capitalist system\\". At the end of 1919, the Commission for Combating Prostitution under the People's Commissariat of Health was established, and later the Interdepartmental Commission for Combating Prostitution under the People's Commissariat of Social Security. At the beginning of the New Economic Policy (NEP), prostitution experienced a new surge, it was practised almost openly by representatives of all strata of society. According to surveys, prostitutes were used by 40% to 60% of the adult male population. There were attempts to reintroduce compulsory medical examinations of prostitutes. The police's attempts to repress prostitution (raids, etc.) were combined with the ideas of social prevention advocated by the Central Commission for Combating Prostitution under the People's Commissariat for Health; during the last program, special dispensaries for the socialisation of prostitutes were created. =In the Soviet Union= Specific laws prohibiting prostitution were not introduced into the Soviet codes until 1987, but prostitutes could be prosecuted under other articles of the criminal and administrative codes. The involvement of minors in prostitution, pandering and the maintenance of brothels was directly legislated against. Ideological negation did not interfere with the actual existence of prostitution in the USSR, although not in an organised form. Hidden prostitution flourished in the form, for example, of \\"processing\\" vacationers at resorts. A rise in prostitution was noted in the 1970s. Pre-perestroika period Prostitutes started to be pursued in 1929. A system has been introduced according to which prostitutes were sent to the system of \\"special institutions of forced labour re-education\\" supervised by the NKVD  open-type workshops, semi-closed laboratories and suburban colonies of special treatment; in the case of relapse after release from the colony, women were sometimes sent to the camps of the NKVD. The largest colony for prostitutes was located in the Trinity-Sergius Monastery. The treatment in the dispensaries became tougher in 1937 when the dispensaries for former prostitutes were transferred to the Gulag system. In the early 1930s, suspected prostitutes were subjected to administrative expulsions. With the deployment of the Great Terror they were sentenced to imprisonment on political charges: prostitutes were now classed as class enemies. At the same time, any information about prostitution from the press pages disappeared to create the impression of eradicating the phenomenon. Indeed, organised forms of prostitution in Stalin's times were eradicated. It was believed that prostitution \\"as a widespread social phenomenon\\" can not exist in a socialist society because social conditions precipitating it had disappeared; therefore, any cases were the result of atypical personal shortcomings; prostitution was seen as a form of parasitic existence. In the period from 1955 to 1985, despite the declaration of the incompatibility of prostitution with the socialist way of life, the regime did not dare to enact the legal prohibition of prostitution, although both criminal law and administrative law were used to prosecute prostitutes. Assessment of the scale and social characteristics of prostitution in the post-war period was complicated even in comparison with the period of the 1920s and 1930s. During all of this time, only two empirical studies of prostitution were conducted, but the results were not made public and labelled \\"For official use\\". Perestroika (1986–1991) The edition on prostitutes working for the KGB, in the newspaper Novy Vzglyad (1993) After 1927, nothing was mentioned in the press about domestic prostitution. Even among sociologists, the topic was taboo: At the same time in the Western media, materials on Soviet prostitutes were published regularly. In 1959, after the publication in the British News of the World of an article on hotel prostitution, the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a resolution on additional measures to combat prostitution (in particular, the hotels were banned from allowing \\"strangers\\" in after 23:00), but for Soviet journalists the theme remained forbidden. The first publications on prostitution in Soviet periodicals are the articles by Yevgeny Dodolev in the Moskovskij Komsomolets newspaper: \\"Night Hunters\\" (October 24, 1986) and \\"White Dance\\" (November 19 and continued November 21, 1986). These sensational essays brought Moskovskij Komsomolets to the attention of all unions and raised circulation to a record level. As a consequence, on May 29, 1987, the Code of Administrative Offences of the RSFSR was amended with Article 164-2, which punishes prostitution with a fine of 100 rubles (at that time the monthly salary of a low-skilled worker). A similar article has been preserved in modern legislation. One of the notable events of the perestroika life of the USSR was the publication of the novel by Vladimir Kunin Interdevochka in the magazine Aurora in 1988. The writer conducted a serious study on the professional activities of prostitutes and for several months followed their work in one of the Leningrad hotels. The working title of the story was \\"The Prostitute\\". The editors did not dare to publish the story with such a scandalous title, and Kunin replaced it with a euphemism \\"Intergirl\\". Subsequently, this neologism firmly entered the Russian language. The story aroused a violent reaction among the reading audience and the editorial board received a large number of responses. Pyotr Todorovsky directed the film adaptation Intergirl, released to theaters in 1989. Since the 1980s, there has been trafficking: women and girls are sent \\"to work\\" abroad. There is still no information on clients of Soviet prostitutes during the period.

Set in France around the turn of the seventeenth century, it is the story of a young woman named Constance who is in love with Gaspar, the son of her father's enemy. Because their fathers killed each other in battle, Constance feels she cannot marry Gaspar, even though he loves her too. She spends a night on St. Catherine's Couch, a ledge of rock overlooking a river, in the hope that St. Catherine will offer her guidance in her dreams. She does, and Constance and Gaspar are married the next day.  Summary  Countess Constance de Villeneuve is a recently orphaned heiress living in Nantes, France, who is in love with the son of her father's enemy, Gaspar De Vaudemont. Their fathers killed each other in battle, and Constance feels torn between her love for Gaspar and her duty to her late father. Gaspar and King Henry IV, a friend of her father's, try to reassure Constance that it would be wrong to sacrifice her happiness, but she remains unsure. Unable to make a decision about the marriage, she decides to spend a night sleeping on St. Catherine's Couch, a ledge of rock overlooking the Loire river. Legend holds that St. Catherine will appear to anyone who sleeps on the rock and offer them guidance. Gaspar hears about this plan and, terrified for Constance's safety, keeps watch underneath the ledge all night. Constance dreams about Gaspar's death in battle, and the agony she feels about the idea of losing him convinces her that marrying him is the right thing to do. Just before she wakes up, she begins to toss and turn, and Gaspar rushes to her side. She awakens in Gaspar's arms, which have kept her from falling to her death in the river. She tells him about her dream and her decision to marry him, and they are married later that day in the chapel dedicated to St. Catherine.  Publication history  \\"The Dream\\" was first published in The Keepsake for 1832, a British literary annual. It was accompanied by an engraved illustration called Constance, painted by Louisa Sharpe and engraved by Charles Heath. It has since been reprinted in several anthologies.Robinson, Charles E. Notes on \\"The Dream\\". In A fair-copy holograph manuscript of the tale is held in The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library in New York, which shows that Shelley edited the original version of the tale to better fit the illustration.  Themes and influences  \\"The Dream\\" is one of several Gothic tales that Mary Shelley published in The Keepsake. Others include \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" (1829), \\"The Evil Eye\\" (1830), \\"Transformation\\" (1831), \\"The Invisible Girl\\" (1832), and \\"The Mortal Immortal\\" (1834).\\"The Dream\\" is more ambiguously Gothic than some of Shelley's other tales, but engages with common Gothic themes such as thwarted love, messages in dreams, and visions of ghosts. The tale may have been influenced by John Keats' poem \\"The Eve of St. Agnes,\\" which is also the story of a young woman turning to a supernatural power for romantic advice. In terms of form, \\"The Dream\\" is a variation on the Gothic fragment, exemplified by Anna Letitia Aiken's \\"Sir Bertrand: A Fragment\\" (1773). Although it is often categorized as a short story, that form was not named until the 1880s in Britain. It is more accurately classified as a Gothic tale, a story about an experience of the strange or supernatural, often narrated in the first or third person.

The firm was established in 2002, operating under a business model wherein lawyers use a technology platform provided to work flexibly, rather than necessarily working in a physical office space maintained by the firm. In 2017, it became the third firm in the UK to be listed on the London Stock Exchange (KEYS). History =Foundation and early growth= The firm was established in 2002 by solicitor James Knight, formerly with Trowers & Hamlins, and Charles Stringer, who was then Head of Sales at the BBC. They did so with the premise that it would provide legal services without the overhead inherent in maintaining an office environment for employees. The firm was initially called Lawyers Direct, and brought attention to itself through promotional efforts such as distributing 1,000 bags of peanuts at a Department of Trade and Industry awards ceremony with their logo and the slogan, \\"These days you have to be nuts to pay for overhead\\".Rachel Bridge, You Can Do It Too: The 20 Essential Things Every Budding Entrepreneur Should Know (2010), p. 103. In 2008, the firm re-branded as Keystone Law, due to concerns that it was overly associated with personal injury work, contrary to the broader and higher-level experience of many of the lawyers involved. The firm developed an IT platform through which its lawyers telework from remote locations, providing office facilities when face to face meetings are required. By allowing its lawyers to work from their homes, the firm avoids the costs of maintaining office space, and the lawyers avoid the costs of commuting, allowing the firm to reduce customer costs. The late 2000s recession, which generally impacted traditional law firms negatively, created opportunities for the firm to expand its practice areas, with the addition of a healthcare law group in 2011. The firm had 70 lawyers as of 2008, 95 lawyers as of 2010, and 300 lawyers as of 2018. Lawyers are generally been recruited from other firms after garnering six to ten years of experience in practice, depending on the office, and do not have a set target for billable hours, instead being paid a percentage of the fees generated by their work. =Structural changes and international expansion= In October 2013, the firm converted to an Alternative Business Structure (ABS), making it the 173rd ABS to be approved by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, enabling the firm to offer a range of services in addition to law. It also allowed non-solicitor and co-founder Charles Stringer to become a director of the firm. Also in 2013, the firm implemented a recruitment campaign to attract partner level lawyers to join the firm, increasing its headcount by 48% over the following year. The firm formally launched operations in Australia on May 30, 2014, under the name Keypoint Law. The name selection was due to the unavailability of the Keystone name in Australia. In October 2014, the firm accepted £3.15m in investment from private equity firm, Root Capital. Root acquired a 35% equity interest from Charles Stringer, one of the founding Partners. In January 2016 Keystone announced the opening of an office on the Isle of Man, which required the establishment of a new law firm there, in accordance with local regulations. The move made Keystone the first UK law firm to establish a presence there in nearly 30 years. In November 2016, Legal Week named Keystone Law in their annual Best Legal Advisers report. The firm was positively reviewed by Chris Bull, who chaired the judging panel of the 2016 Eclipse Proclaim Modern Law Awards, in a 2016 interview in Modern Law Magazine. Following the launch of its Isle of Man office, the firm opened an office in Northern Ireland by means of a commercial merger with existing Belfast firm McMahon McKay. In November 2017, Keystone announced plans to become the third firm in the UK to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, with an initial public offering. The listing was carried out on November 27, 2017, with share prices rising by approximately 20% shortly thereafter. Accreditation Keystone Law is a consistent recipient of industry awards, such as the Law Society Excellence Awards, and is annually recognised by Chambers and Partners (Guide to the world's best lawyers) and the Legal 500. The firm is also recognised as the UK's Best Legal Adviser in Legal Week and by the Lawyer UK 200.

After Iranian Revolution in 1979, Bazargan nominated him as the governor of Khorasan Province. Ahmadzadeh initially rejected the appointment, on the grounds that Ruhollah Khomeini has installed Abbas Vaez-Tabasi as the costudian of Astan Quds Razavi and he should maintain the former position as well. He was ousted soon after resignation of Bazargan. According to Ervand Abrahamian, he was tagged \\"liberal\\" and a \\"sympathizer of the Mojahedin\\" at the time. In June 1981, he started to openly criticizing the clergy for \\"monopolizing power\\". Sobsequently, Ahmadzadeh was imprisoned in Evin Prison and in 1983 he was forced to confess in a televised program called \\"roundtable discussions\\". He was released four years later. Ahmadzadeh was detained again in 2000, when he was 80. Personal life His sons Masoud and Majid, as well as his daughter Mastureh were among leading members of the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas. His youngest son, Mojtaba, was a sympathizer of the People's Mujahedin of Iran and was executed during 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners.

Bolivar Coastal Field is the largest oil field in South America with its 6,000-7,000 wells and forest of related derricks, stretches thirty-five miles along the north-east coast of Lake Maracaibo. They form the largest oil field outside of the Middle East and contain mostly heavy oil with a gravity less than 22 degrees API. Also known as the Eastern Coast Fields, Bolivar Coastal Oil Field consists of Tía Juana, Lagunillas, Bachaquero, Ceuta, Motatán, Barua and Ambrosio. The Bolivar Coast field lies in the Maracaibo dry forests ecoregion, which has been severely damaged by farming and ranching as well as oil exploitation. The oil field still plays an important role in production from the nation with approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil a day. It is important to note that the oil and gas industry refers to the Bolivar Coastal Complex as a single oilfield, in spite of the fact that the oilfield consists of many sub-fields as stated above. Bolivar Coastal Complex is entirely owned and operated by Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela), the Venezuelan state-owned oiland natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter. According to the List of oil fields, the Bolivar Coastal Field is ranked #7 in the world in recoverable oil, past and future at 30-32 billion barrels. Portions of the oil field have already been fully depleted.The Royal Dutch Shell Group of Companies in Venezuela, 1913-1922 Image of main Maracaibo Assessment Unit  History  The large oil seeps around Lake Maracaibo were noted in the 16th century by the Spanish, who used the tar to caulk their ships and treat skin problems on livestock. The U.S. based General Asphalt Company conducted the first geological investigations on the east shore of Lake Maracaibo but sold its concession to Royal Dutch Shell in 1912. Shell drilled the discovery well at Mene Grande in 1914 and the famous Los Barrosos 2 gusher at Cabimas in 1922. Another major find was the 'Zumaque 1' well in 1914,:es:Municipio Baralt (Zulia, Venezuela) (Spanish) in the area of Mene Grande, Maracaibo Basin, about southeast of Cabimas (Zulia State). Production grew rapidly and this became Shell's most important producing property worldwide. Edward Doheny's Pan American Oil then took the unusual step of obtaining concessions in the lake itself. These concessions were purchased by Indiana Standard (now Amoco) in 1925, but development was minimal until they were sold to Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon) in 1931. Development in Lake Maracaibo proceeded rapidly after the end of the Second World War and this became Exxon's most important producing property worldwide throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Nationalism then played a role in the oil industry; no new exploration concessions were offered after 1958, and the industry was nationalized at the end of 1975. The nationalized entity, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, is now one of the world's largest integrated oil companies. The award of marginal field reactivation blocks to Occidental and Shell in 1994 marked the beginning of a new phase of international participation in the Maracaibo basin. Another block was subsequently awarded to a consortium of Tecpetrol, Nomeco, and Wascana, and Chevron has agreed in principal with Maraven, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, on a venture that would include the giant Boscan heavy oil field and Chevron's asphalt division in the U.S. Two blocks in the basin are to be offered in the 1995 exploration round. In summary, the Maracaibo basin oil fields played a major role in the growth of three of the world's largest oil companies; the Royal Dutch/Shell group, Exxon, and Petroleos de Venezuela. Much early development of the technologies of offshore production and steam injection took place there. Sir Henri Deterding once described Shell's purchase of the General Asphalt properties around Lake Maracaibo as his best business deal. That is a strong statement from someone whose business deals included the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum with Shell Transport and Trading.  Introduction  Satellite image showing the geographical location of the Maracaibo Basin The Gulf Caribbean region currently contains 5% of the total ultimate recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons on Earth (Horn, 2003). Venezuela has the largest reserves of hydrocarbons of all the hydrocarbon regions of the western hemisphere, with proved oil reserves of about 70 billion bbl oil and proved gas reserves of 147 tcf (U.S. Geological Survey, 2000; Audemard and Serrano, 2001). These reserve estimates do not include the immense, unconventional reserves of the Orinoco heavy oil belt, with an estimated approximately 1200 billion bbl of heavy and extra-heavy oil in place (Fiorillo, 1987; U.S. Geological Survey, 2000). The active tectonic setting of petroleum in Venezuela is complex. Several tectonic belts that include volcanic-arc, fore-arc, and back-arc basins are found offshore of the Venezuelan margin. A west-to-east lounging pattern of thrusts and lateral ramp faults and foreland basins onshore (Babb and Mann, 1999; Mann, 1999) were produced by diachronous oblique convergence between Caribbean arc terranes and the South American continental margin from Late Cretaceous (western area of Colombia) to the present (eastern area of Trinidad). This ideal combination of tectonic and stratigraphic events yielded one of the most prolific petroleum systems in the world.  Geology  The deposition of rift- related rocks in the Late Jurassic marked the beginning of the sedimentary geological history of the Maracaibo Basin in structural lows or half grabens controlled by linear, north-northeast–striking normal faults. During the Early Cretaceous–Paleocene, a mixed clastic-carbonate platform developed across the area of present-day Maracaibo Basin. Thermal subsidence and tectonic quiescence of the passive margin led to sediment accumulation and the absence of deformation of the basin during this period. The few structures present in the Maracaibo Basin during the Cretaceous formed by tectonic uplift of the Western and Central Cordilleras of Colombia. This uplift is responsible for an increase in subsidence by the end of the Cretaceous that resulted in deposition of thick marine shale of the Colon Formation during the Maastrichtian. During the late Turonian–Campanian, the La Luna Formation was deposited in a shelf-slope setting under anoxic conditions. The La Luna Formation became the main source rock of northwestern South America. In the late Paleocene and early to middle Eocene, the Caribbean plate and the northwestern margin of South America produced a complex foreland wedge filled by clastic sediments in the northeastern part of the Maracaibo Basin. The foreland basin was characterized by an approximately 5-km (3.1-mi)-thick Eocene wedge of fluvial-deltaic sedimentation (Misoa Formation), where the most prolific hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Maracaibo Basin are concentrated. Fluvial and shallow-marine sedimentation continued in the south and southwest areas of the Maracaibo Basin. The Eocene unconformity represents the main seal above Eocene reservoirs, but it is locally breached by faulting, allowing the upward ascent of hydrocarbons into Miocene reservoirs at the basin edges.  Petroleum systems  The figure below shows the hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Maracaibo basin. Most Eocene reservoir rocks are spatially aligned with the north-south–striking Icotea and Pueblo Viejo faults, whereas most Miocene reservoirs rocks are clustered along the eastern and northeastern margin of the present-day Lake Maracaibo. Ninety four percent of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Maracaibo Basin are found within Eocene–Miocene clastic rocks (Talukdar and Marcano, 1994). Only 6% of reservoirs are found within underlying Cretaceous–Paleocene carbonate rocks and basement. The figure to the right shows an east-west and a north-south interpreted seismic line in the central Maracaibo Basin, summarizing the main elements of the Maracaibo petroleum system from Cretaceous source rock to Eocene and Miocene reservoirs. The two interpreted seismic lines show the northeast thickening of the Eocene clastic wedge, the southwest thickening of the Miocene–Holocene clastic wedge, and the main structural and stratigraphic controls of the basin inherited from the north-northeast–striking fault family. = Source rocks = Hydrocarbon source rocks in the Maracaibo Basin are Upper Cretaceous marine carbonate rocks (calcareous shales and argillaceous limestones) that make up the La Luna Formation of Cenomanian–Campanian age. Previous geochemical studies show that the La Luna Formation is the source of 98% of the total oil reserves found in the Maracaibo Basin. An additional 2% of the total oil reserve was derived from nonmarine coals and shales of the Paleocene Orocue Formation that are found in the southwestern part of the basin. Gonzalez de Juana et al. (1980) proposed that Eocene and Miocene terrestrial source rocks, now deeply buried in the southern part of the basin, may act as additional source rock to the La Luna Formation. Geochemical analysis of Tertiary sedimentary rocks indicates no significant hydrocarbon potential for Eocene and Miocene shale, nor is there any evidence for oils correlated to this type of source rocks. A Santonian change in depositional environment to more oxygenated and cooler waters in the La Luna Formation (Tres Esquinas Member) suggests the advent of tectonic activity (Erlich et al., 2000; Bralower and Lorente; 2003; Parra et al., 2003; Zapata et al., 2003). Late Cretaceous tectonic activity was possibly related to the reactivation of faults beneath the basin or regional plate convergence in western Colombia that caused abrupt changes in the paleotopography and paleoclimate and ended passive-margin conditions. An increase in upwelling and more oxygenation of shelf waters of northern South America may be related to (1) the migration of the South American plate toward the Cretaceous intertropical convergence zone (Villamil et al., 1999); (2) an increase in freshwater runoff produced by the emergent Central Cordillera of Colombia (Erlich et al., 2003); and (3) the establishment of wet-dry cycles and submersion of paleobathymetric barriers for ocean circulation (Erlich et al., 2003).  La Luna source rocks and hydrocarbon characteristics  The La Luna formation is the most prominent formation in the Maracaibo Basin and is the source rock content for majority of Bolivar Coastal Field. This is considered to be a great oil-prone source rock. At the figure to the right, the distribution in percentages of hydrocarbon generated by the La Luna formation source rocks is shown. Comparison of gas-chromatographic and biomarker characteristics of oils and La Luna source rock extracts shows that the La Luna Formation is the source rock for more than 98% of the oil accumulations in the Maracaibo Basin. The La Luna source rocks contain oil- prone type II kerogen and are rich in hydrogen content, with the bulk of the organic matter derived from algae and bacteria (Perez-Infante et al., 1996). The average original total organic carbon (TOC) of La Luna source rocks in the Maracaibo Basin is 5.6%. Maximum TOC values are locally as high as 16.7%. In the southwestern area of the basin, the average TOC is 4.3%. In the Sierra de Perijá area, TOC values range from 3.7 to 5.7%. In the Merida Andes, TOC values range between 1.7 and 2%. At the figure to the right, the distribution in percentages of hydrocarbon generated by the La Luna formation source rocks is shown. Comparison of gas-chromatographic and biomarker characteristics of oils and La Luna source rock extracts shows that the La Luna Formation is the source rock for more than 98% of the oil accumulations in the Maracaibo Basin. = Reservoir rocks = They are a wide variety of reservoir rocks throughout the Maracaibo Basin, ranging from metamorphic rocks to shallow, unconsolidated, Miocence rocks. According to Harding and Tuminas, structural traps are controlled by a variety of features, including normal fault, inverted faults on the flexed continental plate. Stratigraphic traps are found in heterogeneous, mixed fluvial, and tidal-dominated deltaic systems defining regressive-transgressive cycles on the Eocene Maracaibo shelf and nearshore to fluvial Miocene sandstone rocks (Guzmn and Fisher, 2006). Major reservoir facies are stacked distributary channels and tidal bars (Maguregui, 1990; Ambrose et al., 1995; Escalona, 2003). Hydrocarbon reservoirs can be classified in three main types: * Sub-Eocene Reservoirs  Cretaceous limestone and Paleocene sandstone  Reservoirs include fractured rocks associated with the reactivation of north-south strike-slip, northwest- southeast–striking normal fault, and thrusts related to the uplift of Merida Andes * Eocene Reservoirs  Most prolific  Structural traps associated with anticlines (i.e. Icotea and Pueblo faults)  Eocene unconfromity forms traps in fluvial deltaic sandstone * Miocene Reservoirs  Second most prolific  Fluvial Miocene sandstone facies located in anticlines  Stratigraphic wedges beneath Eocene unconformity (i.e. Burro Negro fault)  Oil escaped to the surface and formed seeps that outline the edges of the Maracaibo basin where no structural or stratigraphic traps were present  Migration and trapping  Petroleum geologists summarize the petroleum system evolution of the Maracaibo Basin in four phases. The adjacent image shows the four main tectonic phases controlling the petroleum system of the Maracaibo Basin. = Carbonate Platform Phase = During this phase in the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, the La Luna Formation source rock was deposited on a shallow, passive-margin, shelf-to-slope environment. It thickness ranges from . Carbonate thickness variations were controlled by minor basement relief of underlying pre- Cretaceous structures like the Merida arch. = Foreland Phase = During the early Eocene, oblique collision between the Caribbean and South American plates formed an asymmetric wedge of fluvial-deltaic Eocene rocks that were deposited in a foreland basin (Lugo and Mann, 1995; Escalona and Mann, 2006a). Cretaceous source rocks were buried to depths of in the north-northeastern part of the Maracaibo Basin and reached the oil window. A pull-apart basin controlled by reactivated Jurassic north-northeast–striking faults formed in the central Maracaibo Basin (Icotea subbasin; Escalona and Mann, 2003b). Strike-slip faults provided vertical pathways for hydrocarbon migration from Cretaceous source rocks (La Luna Formation) to Eocene reservoir sands. = Isostatic Rebound Phase = During the late Eocene to Oligocene, most of the Maracaibo Basin was sub-aerially exposed and eroded by isostatic rebound that followed the end of the convergence foreland basin phase. This period of rebound and erosion lasted approximately 20 m.y. in the central parts of the basin and is characterized by the loss of hydrocarbons to the surface (Talukdar and Marcano, 1994). Furthermore, biodegradation of oils occurred because of the invasion of meteoric waters into shallowly buried Eocene reservoirs. Summary of four main tectonic phases controlling the petroleum system of the Maracaibo Basin: (A) carbonate platform phase; (B) foreland basin phase; (C) isostatic rebound phase; and (D) Maracaibo syncline phase. = Maracaibo Syncline Phase = During the Miocene to Holocene, his phase of basin development was characterized by uplift of the Sierra de Perija and the Merida Andes, the formation of the north-south–trending Maracaibo syncline, and early Miocene inversion of Eocene structures in the central part of the basin. In contrast to the Eocene, the Neogene depocenter was located in the southern Maracaibo Basin, where continental facies pinch out to the east- northeast to form major stratigraphic traps.  Future  The complex interplay of deformation, burial, and sedimentation in the Maracaibo Basin during the Cretaceous combined to make the basin one of the most effective and prolific petroleum systems on Earth. Deposition and distribution of ideal source and reservoir rocks were stratigraphically and structurally controlled by multiple tectonic events that led to hydrocarbon generation, migration, and accumulation. The Maracaibo Basin has a promising hydrocarbon discovery potential in the mostly undrilled deeper structural and stratigraphic traps of the central and eastern basin (e.g., Icotea and Pueblo Viejo subbasins). More than 14 billion bbl of medium to light oil of ultimate recoverable reserves are predicted to be produced from these areas (U.S. Geological Survey, 2000). The Maracaibo basin has a long history as a major oil producing basin, but many areas remain poorly explored. The large exploration potential combined with the enormous amount of remaining oil in place in known reservoirs guarantees that the Maracaibo basin will have a long future as a major oil producing basin.

Its summit lies 1.1 km northeast of Hengebach Castle (Heimbach Castle), which is situated in the heart of the town of Heimbach on the River Rur, and 1.2 km south-southwest of the village church of Hausen, which is further downstream. At the western foot of the hill is the village of Fischbachtal, a small settlement between Heimbach and Hausen, and about km (each as the crow flies) east lies the village of Vlatten. To the south the countryside transitions to the Eichelberg (379.1 m) hill near Heimbach. A northern spur of the Sonnenberg, towards Hausen, is called the Rensberg which, on topographical maps somewhat north of its name at almost the same spot gives the heights as 348.4 m and 346.5 m. The Sonnenberg descends steeply to the Rur; from the summit to the river (ca. 193 m) near Hausen (Rur bridge: 195.9 m) is a height difference of about 200 metres. The hillsides above the Rur are, in places, characterised by prominent slate crags. The Sonnenberg is partly used for agriculture. In addition, a gas pipeline and a 110-kV pylon runs over it. There are several shrines and altars to the Madonna and Child. = Natural regions = The Sonnenberg is in the natural region major unit group of the West Eifel/Ardennes (no. 28), in the major unit of the Rur Eifel (282), in the subunit of the Rur-Urft-Olef valleys (282.3) and in the natural region of the Heimbach-Maubacher Rurtal (282.34).  Protected areas  On the Sonnenberg, which is covered by the woods of the Hausener Busch, lie parts of the protected area of Kreis Düren (Teilfläche 1) (CDDA no. 322307; 1988; 307.29 km²). On its lower slopes in the south, west and northwest are separate elements of the nature reserve of Buntsandsteinfelsen im Rurtal zwischen Heimbach und Kreuzau (CDDA no. 318269; designated in 1981; 56 ha).  Transport and walking  The Landesstraße 249 runs along the Rur from Heimbach to Hausen passing the Sonnenberg to the west. South of the hill it crosses the L 218 in Heimbach; the latter runs from Vlatten through Heimbach to Hasenfeld. From these and other roads or in the villages mentioned the hill may be reached on numerous woodland tracks and paths; it is a popular walking area.

He was awarded the titles People's Writer of the Uzbek SSR in 1959, Hero of Socialist Labor in 1974, and the USSR State Prize in 1951.  Early life  Yashin was born in Andijan, Russian Turkestan. After graduating high school he studied at the Leningrad Forestry Institute but was forced to return to the Uzbek SSR after studying for three years due to illness. For several years he taught literature and physics at a secondary school in Andijan. From 1930 to 1936 Yashin was in charge of the literary department of the Uzbek State Musical Theater. During that time he wrote the plays including \\"Comrades\\" in 1930, \\"Burn\\" in 1931, \\"Honor and Love\\" in 1935, and co-authored the musical drama \\"Gulsara\\" in 1935 with Muzaffar Muhamedov.  Career and writings  Yashin, who had met the famous poet Hamza Niyazi several times, was tremendously affected by his writings and violent death; Hamza was the subject of several of Yashin's works. In the years leading up to World War II Yashin wrote librettos for the first national operas in the Uzbek SSR, \\"Boʻron\\" and \\"Ulugʻ kanal\\". After the brutal honor killing Nurkhon Yuldashkhojayeva, of one of the first Uzbek women to perform on the stage without the veil, Yashin wrote the musical \\"Nurkhon\\" detailing her life and death as that of a brave martyr of the women's liberation. Nurkhon's murder was not the only honor-killing of a celebrity of the stage in the Hujum era, with the earlier murder of Tursunoi Saidazmova, the famed \\"Uzbek nightingale\\" known for her singing. Yashin had been friends with screenwriter Hamza Niyazi who was stoned to death in Shohimardon by Islamists after he had written works critical of Islam and supportive of women's rights. Yashin later wrote the musical \\"Hamza\\" dedicated to his life and efforts against superstition that eventually led to his brutal murder. Other musicals Yashin wrote included \\"Nomus va Muhabbat\\", \\"Oʻlim bosqinchilarga\\" (1942), \\"Davron ota\\" (1942, co- author), \\"Farod va Shirin\\" (1944) and \\"Oftobxon\\" (1944), some of which were created for Soviet troops in the Second World War, usually referred to in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War. After the war he wrote the scripts for the plays \\"General Rakhimov\\" (1949), \\"Ravshan va Zulxumor\\" (1956), \\"Secret under the Paranja\\", and \\"Dawn of the Revolution\\" (1972). He later directed a documentary film on the life of Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi, of whom he also published a novel about, served as editor-in-chief of the magazine Uzbek Tili va Adabyti (Uzbek language and literature) and was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Prior to the fight, Hamed began having trouble with his longtime trainer Brendan Ingle stemming from comments Ingle had made in his book \\"The Paddy and the Prince\\".

Hamed would get off to a fast start after knocking down Ingle in the first round after landing a left to Ingle's body and then following that with a left to the head. Hamed would continue to control the bout and Ingle would be forced to take a knee in the sixth for Hamed's second knockdown after Hamed landed another two-left combination to the head and body. Ingle would continue the fight and suddenly take control of the fight in the ninth round, landing several power punches and bloodying Hamed's nose and mouth. However, 30 seconds into the 11th round, Hamed would land a left hand to Ingle's head sending him down for the third time in the fight.

The church is affiliated to the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, Methodist Church Ghana and the Anglican Diocesan Council of Ghana. The church also has branches in the suburbs of Tudu and Manet. The church is also the owner of the Ridge Church School, a preparatory day basic school located on the chapel premises.  History  The old Chapel Records indicate that the idea for a church for European expatriates dates back to either 1935 or 1936. The first chaplain was appointed in 1936. In a 1954 church pamphlet, it was stated that \\"The Ridge Church originated in 1935 due to the community of worship desired by a number of residents from the residential area of Accra, known as Ridge.\\" A Minute Book from that period reads, The Chapel Sanctuary > “On Monday, 18th January 1937, a meeting was held in the European Chaplaincy > of members of the Congregation of the European Church. There were 19 members > of the congregation present and the Chaplain, Rev. W.G. Howard\\". At this > meeting, a committee was formed \\"to be responsible for the organization and > administration of the Chaplaincy services and finance\\", and thus began what > has now become the present Church Council. The initiative in establishing > this Church came from a number of Europeans, mainly in Government service > and large Anglicans who wanted a service in English and of simpler pattern > than that available at Holy Trinity Cathedral. This development was > supported by the then Bishop of Accra, Bishop Aglionby. The first Chaplain > was Rev. W.G. Harward, appointed by the (Anglican) Society for Propagation > of the Gospel, which supported similar chaplaincies in various parts of the > world. (As a matter of interest, it may be mentioned that Mr. Harward-as > Canon Harward- later became the Headmaster of Adisadel). So the Church began > as an English-speaking congregation, with vigorous lay participation from > its inception. Although the Ridge started as an Anglican congregation, Rev. > H.H.G. Macmillan of the Scottish Mission and Rev. M.B. Taylor, Chairman of > the Methodist Church, conducted services at the Church from time to time, > and the time the congregation moved to its present site, it had begun to > assume its present interdenominational character. In due course, this > development was finalized by the appointment of honorary Methodist and > Presbyterian Chaplain, and the adoption of an interdenominational > constitution.” The original church started its services in a government-rented wooden building in the same area which is now the office location for the Labour Department, Youth Development and Youth Employment Center. Half of the original wooden structure served as a manse for the chaplain. A concrete chapel-the old church, which has now been demolished, was completed in 1946. Due to increasing numbers, a new chapel was constructed in 1968 a southerly extension was added in 1986 to coincide with the Golden Jubilee anniversary of the church.  Church hierarchy and groups  At any given time, the church hosts three chaplains from the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian denominations. The church groups include the Accra Ridge Church (ARC) Choir, the Evangelism committee which engages in outreach through breakfast meetings, film, testimony and Tract Sundays. Others include Sidepersons/ushers, Men's fellowship as well as the Women's fellowship, the ARC Youth fellowship and Sunday School. There is also Mission 50+, a group targeting ageing members for spiritual nurture and engaging in activities such as food sales.

Parsons (born 19 June 1951, in Bridlington, Yorkshire), also known as Steve Parsons, Stephen Parsons, Snips, Mr. Snips, SWP, is a British musician, composer, songwriter and music producer. Career Steve Parsons debuted his musical career in the Hull scene, where (in the years 1968–1972) he played in several Beat music groups (21st Century, Spanish Leather, Flesh, Chest Fever and Nothineverappens). His talent was spotted by Island Records and, after a successful audition, he received an offer to join the newly created supergroup Sharks as lead singer and songwriter. The band included Chris Spedding and ex-Free bassist Andy Fraser. It was initially managed by Island founder Chris Blackwell. The initial album, First Water, was released in 1973. The band travelled in a Sharkmobile (a customised Pontiac LeMans with a fin on the roof and teeth on the grill) and supported Roxy Music on their first UK tour. After this tour Fraser left the band due to musical differences and he was replaced by Busta 'Cherry' Jones from Memphis, Tennessee. The band added Nick Judd on keyboards and recorded their second album Jab It in Yore Eye. Sharks successfully toured the US in 1974, but were unable to build on this as they broke up at the end of the year. As Mr. Snips, he joined the Baker Gurvitz Army in 1975 and sang on both their second album Elysian Encounter and their third Hearts on Fire. The band toured extensively in Europe and the US before breaking up. He then contributed vocals and songs to Ginger Baker's solo album Ginger Baker and Friends in 1977. In the same year he contributed a vocal performance to the Intergalactic Touring Band, a science fiction concept album released on Passport Records in the US and Charisma Records in the UK. Other featured vocalists included Ben E. King and Arthur Brown. In 1978 he released his first solo album Snips and the Video Kings on the Jet Records label. He toured with the Video Kings which included John Bentley, Clem Clempson, Graham Deakin and bassist Jackie Badger. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite. Parsons also contributed songs to Chris Spedding's Guitar Graffiti album for RAK Records. In November, Parsons produced what was planned to be Adam and the Ants' second single for Decca Records, \\"I'm A Xerox Machine\\"/\\"Kick\\" recorded at RAK Studios, but the Ants were dropped from Decca before the single could be released. (Retitled Zerox, rerecorded May 1979 with Adam Ant self-producing and with a changed B-side Whip In My Valise, the single was eventually released on Do It Records in summer 1979.) Antshows & Events, Antcatalogue, included with Kings of the Wild Frontier by Adam and the Ants, CBS 84549, 1980Ant, Adam. (2007), Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography, London: Pan Books. p135 In 1979 Parsons married Jackie Badger and, as Snips, then signed to MAM Records, who released a single 9 O’Clock which he co-produced with Midge Ure. Spedding then produced the Snips album La Rocca in 1981 for EMI and the pair reunited briefly for live performances on a North American tour in the same year. Also in 1981, Parsons, as a film director, shot videos for acts from the Cherry Red Records including Men Without Hats. In 1982 he began a career as a composer producer for film and TV, under his real name Stephen Parsons. His early work included public information films for the COI and corporate work. From 1984 until 2005, he worked for advertising clients both in the UK and the US as a composer/producer of music for TV and film. In 1988, he changed his screen credit to Stephen W Parsons to avoid confusion with a composer of Christian music named Stephen Parsons. His UK television credits include Call Red and two series of Fat Friends. In the US he worked on Push for the ABC network in 1998. In partnership with Francis Haines, he wrote the music for the Channel 4 animated documentary Abductees. His film credits include Howling II, Charlie, Funny Man, Journal of a Contract Killer and Nine Miles Down. Feature film scores in partnership with Francis Haines include Conspiracy of Silence (which won US National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Freedom of Expression 2004 award and Director John Deery won the Hartley-Merrill screenwriting award), Another 9½ Weeks, and Split Second. Parsons produced and composed music for a number of instrumental albums between 1985 and 1997, including Dreams of Gold for Filmtrax, Passion for Theta Records and The Institute of Formal Research for Bubblehead Records. IoFR features solos by Zoot Horn Rollo, Guy Barker, Chris Spedding and Mick Taylor. Parsons also contributed four instrumental tracks to the Dungeons & Dragons First Quest concept album in 1986. In 1989 he produced singer Steve Marriott's last album 30 Seconds to Midnite for Castle Records. As screenwriter/producer and composer, his production company shot a pilot film for a television series based on the concepts of writer H.P. Lovecraft. The 45 min. pilot was released on DVD by Lurker Films in 2000 entitled Rough Magik (aka Dreams of Cthulhu). His contribution to the Lovecraft Mythos is detailed in The Lurker in the Lobby, a reference volume for film and TV adaptations of H.P. Lovecraft. As writer/director he shot a feature film Wishbaby in 2005 starring Tiana Benjamin, Doc Brown and Fenella Fielding. The film was released briefly in the UK in 2007 by 4Digital Media, but then became the subject of a legal dispute which has never been resolved. In 2011, as Stephen Parsons, he formed the band King Mob, which included Glen Matlock, Chris Spedding, Martin Chambers and rockabilly guitarist Sixteen. In 2012 they released the album Force 9 (produced by Parsons) on the SPV Steamhammer label. Also in 2012, as SWP, he began writing a series of articles for the online magazine Trebuchet, which offer a personal view of the history and development of counter culture. His specialist subjects include: Philip K. Dick, Charles Manson and H. P. Lovecraft. In 2013 he co-wrote and co-produced the Chris Spedding album Joyland for Cleopatra Records. Guest stars on the album included Bryan Ferry, Johnny Marr, Ian McShane and the late Andy Fraser. In the same year he developed a health food company dedicated to California style blending. The brand is now known as Huna Blends and was the subject of a feature in the November 2015 issue of Women's Health magazine. In the Autumn of 2015 he reunited with Chris Spedding to perform Sharks songs as a tribute to Andy Fraser who passed away earlier in the year. In 2017, Sharks released the new album Killers of the Deep (rated by Classic Rock magazine as one of the top 50 albums of the year so far).David Quantic, '’Killers of the Deep – Vets' return shows they've still got the bite'’, Classic Rock The new line up (including Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols) has so far toured the UK and Japan winning acclaim for their high energy and slightly chaotic stage shows.

When she was a child, she and her family were the only people of color who lived in their neighborhood, and she has described this early experience of cultural difference as an inspiration for much of her later writing. She attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and graduated in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts. She moved to California after college and remains a resident of the Bay Area.  Career  Barroga began writing plays in 1979, after her father's death. Her body of work includes more than 50 plays which have been produced for the stage, for radio and for television. Barroga's writing is concerned with the Filipino American diaspora, as well as intergenerational relationships within immigrant families. Her career extends beyond playwriting to include work as a theater producer and director. She was literary manager for the Oakland Ensemble Theater, and has served as an artistic director for the Asian American Theater Company and Teatro ng Tanan in San Francisco. In 1983, she founded the Playwright Forum in Palo Alto to support new works by California writers. The organization would later become the Discovery Project after merging with TheatreWorks, where Barroga has also been a literary manager. Barroga has taught playwriting at California State University, Monterey Bay and Colorado College as well as in Bay Area high schools. Barroga has also acted in television and film. She played the unseen clairvoyant Sylvia in H.P. Mendoza's 2012 horror movie I Am A Ghost. Her plays have been anthologized in Unbroken Thread: An Anthology of Plays By Asian American Women; Bold Words: A Century of Asian American Writing; and But Still, Like Air, I'll Rise: New Asian American Plays. She is a member of the Dramatists Guild and the Theater Communications Group. Barroga's archive is collected by the Stanford University Libraries.  Selected works  Barroga's produced works include The Pigeon Man (1979), Reaching for the Stars (1983), Eye of the Coconut (1987), Kenny Was a Shortstop (1991), Talk-Story (1992), Walls (1993), Rita's Resources (1995), A Good Face (1997), Gadgets (2000), Banyan (2005), and My Friend Morty (2006). Walls (1989), which premiered at the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco, was inspired by Jan Scruggs's book To Heal A Nation. The play is about a Chinese-American reporter covering the controversy surrounding Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It uses the memorial wall as both subject and metaphorical theme, looking at the intersection of politics and art, the history of the Vietnam War, and the divisions – ethnic and otherwise – that characterize the contemporary American experience. The play frames the aesthetic and political objections to Lin's design as part of a larger struggle to define what it means to be American, and what perspectives are allowed to contribute to official history and public memory. Buffaloe'd (2012) is a historical drama that explores the colonization of the Philippines through the experiences of African-American \\"buffalo soldiers\\" who fought there. It centers around the real-life story of David Fagen, who defected from his U.S. regiment and joined the Filipino resistance efforts. It premiered at the San Jose Stage Company with choreography by Alleluia Panis and directed by Anthony J. Haney. It was produced by the Kumu Kahua Theatre in Honolulu, Hawaii in 2017, in a production directed by Reb Beau Allen.

These laws are not applicable to Muslims who married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. History No evidence records administration of Muslim personal law until 1206 on the Indian peninsula, even Muslim invasions took place during this period. During the reign of Slave dynasty (1206-1290 A.D), Khalji dynasty (1290- 1321), the Tughlaq dynasty (1321-1413), the Lodi dynasty (1451 - 1526) and the Sur dynasty (1539- 1555), the court of Shariat, assisted by the Mufti, dealt with cases involving personal law among Muslims. During Sher Shah's regime, the powers of the court were restricted and Muslim law was modified to suit the requirements of the times. During the regime of Mughal kings Babur and Humayun, the earlier laws were followed, and the ulemas (religious scholars) had considerable influence on legal decisions. During Akbar's regime, Ulemas' powers were reduced and shattered the dominance of the orthodox Sunni school. During Jehangir's regime, cutting of noses and ears and death penalty could not be inflicted without the Emperor's permission. Aurangzeb ordered the compilation of a code of law. =East India Company= Under the East India company, Muslim Law was enforced except when Muslims left the disputes to be determined according to Hindu Saastras. The Regulation 11 of .1772 by Sec. 27 enacted that In 1822, the Privy Council recognized the right of Shia Muslims to their own law. =British Raj= The British Raj passed Shariat Act in 1937 is followed in India in matters related to marriage, divorce and succession among Muslims. = Post-Independence India = India's achievement of independence from the British was meant to bring about significant change in the regular life of Indians. Previously under British rule, Indian society was defined by social collectives, caste and religious identity, with a lack of focus on citizenship and the individual. An Indian's relationship with politics and the law was indeed determined by these social measures; the Fundamental Rights Constitution was passed and intended to reverse this concept that an individual could be limited based upon caste, religion, economic status, etc. However, the new standards laid out in the Constitution have not come to fruition in society, even 6 years after the passing of the act. Aspects of gender, caste and religion are still determinants of political influence and access to resources. The Shariat Application Act was enacted by the British government in India in 1937, and, after India became independent from Britain, the Shariat Act (MPL) was maintained in Indian society. The law was originally introduced as a matter of policy by the British government, but upon independence MPL became significant to Muslim identity and religion. This primary aspect of religion has created controversy across both Muslim communities and Hindu political organizations. = Current Debates = Recent debates related to Muslim Personal Law (MPL) are particularly in favor of abolishing the existing legal system for several reasons. It is said that the current organization of MPL in place discriminates against women in three distinct ways; they are that 1) a Muslim man is allowed to marry up to four wives at a time, 2) he can divorce his wife without entering into any legal processes, and 3) he does not need to provide financial support to his ex-wife after three months of the divorce, whereas men of other religions are likely required to support their ex-wives forever. The main issue with any reform or replacement of such provisions in the MPL system is that Muslim identity is such an important part of women's life. If women were to pursue other interests (i.e try and get rid of such provisions in the MPL system), the Muslim community would feel a sense of betrayal in that the traditional values that defined domestic life would not be the same. The Shah Bano case of 1978 is related to these discriminatory provisions. A woman named Shah Bano was married to a man named Mohommed Ahmed Khan. Khan fathered several children with a second wife and Shah bano was forced out of the home; she initially sought a maintenance order for Rs. 500 per month, but was given only Rs. 200 per month upon the separation agreement. No contribution was ever made to her, and she decided to seek legal counsel as a result. Khan very clearly dictated the purpose of the divorce by deciding exactly how much to award Shah Bano with, when to award her and how to do it. By finally deciding to enter into the legal system, Bano shows her pursuit of other interests and the conflict related to muslim domestic life. Marriage and divorce In India, Muslim marriage is a civil contract between a man and a woman. Dissolution of marriage can be done at the instance of the husband (talaq), wife (khula) or mutually (mubarat). Talaq allows a Muslim man to legally divorce his wife by stating the word talaq. Some Muslim groups recognize triple talaq (or talaq-i- biddat), stating three talaqs at once and proclaiming instant divorce as valid method. On 22 August 2017, the Supreme Court of India deemed instant triple talaq unconstitutional. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which declared instant talaq illegal and void, came into effect retroactively from 19 September 2018 after being given assent by the President of India on 31 July 2019. Other Muslim groups follow talaq-i-hasan, where the husband pronounces talaqs on three separate instances, each one at least 1 lunar month apart. If the husband changes his mind after the first or second talaq, or cohabits with his wife, the divorce is nullified. The husband can delegate power to pronounce talaq to his wife or a third person by agreement, called talaq-e-tafweez. Section 5 of the Shariat Act of 1937 concerns Muslim women seeking divorce. Section 5 was subsequently deleted and replaced by Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939. Muslim women can seek divorce in a court of law. A woman can ask for divorce in the following circumstances: * if whereabouts of the husband has not been known for four years * if the husband has not provided for her maintenance for two years * if the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for seven years or more * if the husband has failed to perform his marital obligations for three years * if the husband was impotent at the time of marriage and remains impotent * if the husband has been insane for two years or is suffering from leprosy or virulent venereal disease * if the husband treats the wife with cruelty, even if absent physical violence * if the wife has been given in marriage by her father or guardian before she reached age 15 * if the husband associates with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life or attempts to force her to lead an immoral life * if the husband disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her legal rights over it * if the husband obstructs her in the observance of her religious profession or practice * if he has more than one wife, or does not treat her equitably in accordance with the Quran; or carries out any other ground recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law. Inheritance =Rules of inheritance= * A son gets double the share of the daughter wherever they jointly inherit. * The wife gets one-eighth of the share if there are children and one-fourth of the share if there are no children. In case the husband has more than one wife, the one-eighth share is divided equally among them. The husband gets one fourth of the share of his dead wife's property, if there are children and one-half if there are no children.mulla mohammaden law vol. 3 * If the parent has more than one daughter, only two-thirds of the property is divided equally among daughters. If the parent has only one daughter, half of the parent's property is inherited by her. * The mother gets one-sixth of her dead child's property if there are grandchildren, and one-third of the property if there are no grandchildren. * Parents, children, husband and wife all cases, get shares, whatever may be the number or degree of the other heirs. =Mahr= Mahr is the total money or property that the husband is required to give the wife at the time of marriage (Nikah). The two types of mahr are the prompt mahr which is given to the wife soon after the marriage, and the deferred mahr, which is given to the wife when the marriage has ended, either due to the death of the husband or by divorce. =Will= A Muslim can only give one third of his/her total property through a will (wasiyat). =Gift= Any type of property can be given as gift.

The display of Kim Il-sung portraits was made mandatory at homes in the 1970s. Gradually, they have become mandatory in certain public places as well, such as factories, airports, railway stations, and rail and subway carriages. Portraits of Kim Jong-il have been hung next to Kim Il-sung since the late 1970s. A portrait of Kim Jong-un was displayed for the first time in public in 2018. Rules regarding the placement and maintenance of the portraits are complex and change frequently. At homes, they should be placed on the most prominent wall in the living room with nothing else on it, at high and looking downwards. Of importance, and subject to random checks, is that they are kept clean, a responsibility that usually falls on the lady of the house. History Portrait of Kim Il-sung next to Stalin during the 1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea in 1946 Portraits on the Pyongyang Metro Portraits of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-suk Since the 1940s visual depictions of Kim Il-sung have been commonplace in North Korea. The practice was adopted from Stalin portraits in the Soviet Union and portraits of Mao Zedong in China. Displaying a portrait of Kim Il-sung in every house became mandatory in the 1970s. The state distributed such portraits and instructed people to display them in their living rooms. By Kim Il-sung's 60th birthday in 1972, North Korea had more leader portraits than the Soviet Union or China ever did. In 1972, the compulsory display of the portraits was extended to all factories, airports, and railway stations. At the end of the decade, North Koreans were told to hang portraits of Kim Jong- il next to their portraits of Kim Il-sung. The regulation was put in place relatively late into Kim Jong-il's cult of personality. The reason was that he had little, and by 1980 virtually no, competition as the heir apparent. The order to do so became unofficially so that North Korean propaganda could claim that there was a spontaneous movement that supported Kim Jong-il. By around 1980, every office and home had the two portraits on display. In the 1980s, the rules on portraits were extended yet again to cover rail and subway carriages. Buses and trams were excluded for unknown reasons. Since the early 1990s, Kim Jong-il portraits have been the same size as those depicting Kim Il-sung, and their display has been standardized so that they are always displayed side by side. In the 1990s, a third kind of portrait was added that depicts Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung engaged in discussion about state management. High-ranking officials were given yet another portrait, that of Kim Il-sung's first wife and mother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-suk. Offices, however, do not display this picture. In recent years, the portraits' societal importance has waned. The image of Kim Il-sung underwent changes as he aged and according to political currents: early portraits from the 1960s have him in a Mao suit, while those from the 1980s depict him in a Western suit. Years after his death, he began to appear in the military uniform of Taewonsu (generalissimo). Images of Kim Jong-il, too, went from Mao suit to the Taewonsu uniform. Under Kim Jong-un, the appearances of the portraits have become increasingly standardized. A portrait of Kim Jong-un was displayed for the first time in public in November 2018 during a visit of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel to Pyongyang. Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea, notes that the set of rules regarding the portraits changes frequently, making it \\"remarkable for its constant fluidity\\". Display Today, the portraits are found everywhere in North Korea. Rules regarding the display and maintenance of the portraits are complex. The portraits should be hung on the most prominent wall of the apartment with nothing else on it, preferably in the living room. They must be kept clean and may not be hung off-center. Any disrespect to the images of the leaders is criminal. This includes not only portraits hung on walls but also e.g. images in newspapers. Damage to the portraits leads to an investigation and, if the suspect is found guilty, punishment. A penalty of one day of hard labor at a construction site is reported for failure to properly hang the portraits. The portraits are to be protected even in the case of an emergency. Still, neglecting care for the portraits is considered a rather minor offense, and as such, it is a typical confession that people make during mutual criticism sessions. Random checks for the portraits are carried out, monthly at least during Kim Il-sung's reign, but the inminban (neighborhood watch) sometimes tips people off of inspections. When a North Korean changes apartment, he or she must start by hanging the portraits first. The portraits are usually hung on a wall with nothing else, placed high, and looking downwards. Some families bow to the portraits every morning and in the evening, saying greetings, even though bowing to them is not mandatory even in public places. When a North Korean family mourns a dead member, ceremonial greetings and offerings are made to the deceased, but only after the two portraits have been given the same treatment. The portraits are usually kept clean by adults in the house, typically the mother of the family. They wipe the glass every morning. Sometimes the portraits have a box under them that houses a white cloth used for dusting them that one is not allowed to use for any other purpose. In addition to homes, offices, factories, shops, hospitals, classrooms and libraries sport the portraits, as do decks of ships and fronts of trains. In public buildings they are placed above the main entrances. All portraits are made by the Mansudae Art Studio. They are glazed and framed with timber. Safekeeping Stories about North Koreans saving leader portraits from certain destruction have been sported in North Korean media for decades, and they have also been disseminated by the inminban. For instance, in 2007 it was reported that a factory worker rescued his leader portraits and his five-year- old daughter from a flooded house. When he was overpowered by the water, he let go of his daughter but managed to hold onto the portraits. Such a feat can rise the societal status of a person considerably by improving his or her songbun (ascribed social rank in North Korea). Saving portraits is based on an arbitrary interpretation of the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. Special portraits In addition to the standardized portraits, there have been special cases. One of these is a gift from the Syrian Arab Republic, a portrait of Kim Il-sung that is entirely made up of Arabic calligraphy of his work The Non-Aligned Movement is a Mighty Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Force of Our Times, housed at the International Friendship Exhibition. The largest Kim Il-sung portrait, at least in Pyongyang, was 15 by 11 meters and was hung at the Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 in the 1990s.

History The log house was initially built by W.S. Mayfield in the 1820s. When it was acquired by William Forrest, Nathan Bedford Forrest's father, in 1830, the house was significantly extended.

Personal details  Margaret Kennix was an unlicensed medical practitioner during the Elizabethan Era in London. She had her own medical practice from the years 1571-1585. Margaret was not native to London, and she was known as a Dutch empiric that practiced medicine. It is believed that she lived on the street Old Seacole Lane in London.  Career and difficulties  Margaret Kennix dealt with issues regarding her authority to practice medicine in London. She particularly dealt with the Royal College of Physicians that had a strong presence in the city of London. The Royal College of Physicians was one of the main governing bodies of medicine. King Henry VII established it as a Royal Charter in 1918. The college attempted to put a complete stop to Margaret's medical practice. Margaret Kennix turned to the royal family for help after the College had consistently attempted to shut down her practice entirely. Margaret knew that having someone in the royal family vouching for her was very beneficial. Queen Elizabeth I informed the College in 1581 of her support for Margaret Kennix. Sir Francis Walsingham informed the College of Queen Elizabeth's support for Margaret, and he listed two separate reasons as to why she should be allowed to practice medicine. The first reason was, \\"God has given her a special knowledge to the benefit of the poorer sort\\". He also informed the college that her family, \\"wholly depend on the exercise of her skill\\". This was due to Margaret's husband not being able to work. The College responded to this act of support with a resounding and stout answer. The writer for the College said that Margaret Kennix was an, \\"outlandish, ignorant, sorry woman\\". The College also suggested that allowing Margaret Kennix to practice medicine would set a harmful standard and would be breaking the \\"Holsome Lawes\\" that prevent medical practices foreign to the College. The College believed her \\"weakness and insufficiency\\" were enough to warrant such a response. The final decision of the College is unknown.

Plot Growing up in a sports-loving family in the American South, Lily has dreams of becoming a ballerina. Her ultimate goal is to dance as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker. Her older sister, Beth, is her biggest supporter. She wins the 2003 American Ballet Invitational and is awarded a chance to perform with the New York Ballet. Her mother doesn't want her to go, but Beth convinces her mom otherwise. Lily meets Mark, who has the role of The Nutcracker Prince. However, her dreams of becoming the Sugar Plum Fairy are always stopped by Mark's ex-girlfriend. Eventually the director casts Lily in the role. However, before her debut, she receives word that Beth was killed in a car accident. Mark and the director, fearing for her well- being, refuse to let her dance. Thus, she returns to Georgia and becomes the surrogate mother to her niece, Sadie. Eight years later, Lily is now a yoga instructor. She no longer dances and no longer has room in her life for romance. Sadie has followed in her aunt's footsteps, becoming a ballerina herself (and maybe even more talented than Lily). Sadie is offered the chance to perform with the Philadelphia Ballet, also in The Nutcracker as Clara. Lily now doesn't want Sadie to go, but Lily's mom (as Beth did years ago) convinces her otherwise. Lily finds out that the ballet company owns her apartment building, and that the director is none other than her old flame, Mark. Lily learns that after leaving New York, Mark went into the military and did a tour in Afghanistan before returning to ballet. To the dismay of the dancers (and some of the \\"dance moms\\") Mark asks Lily to direct the lead dancers. Juliet (who was cast as the Sugar Plum Fairy) quits and her understudy is injured; Mark asks Lily to play the role she lost so many years ago. Lily is hesitant but ultimately agrees. Juliet, though, returns and wants her role back; Mark fires her but in doing so, causes Darren (Juliet's boyfriend who was cast as The Nutcracker Prince) to also quit, leaving no choice but for Mark to fill in the role. On opening night, Sadie plays Clara's role wonderfully. Before going on stage, Lily tells Mark she loves him. Lily and Mark perform their dance to a standing ovation and the approval of cast and company (even the dance moms). As they take their final bow Lily sees a vision of Beth in the audience.

Background =Family= Wistrich was born in Hampstead to Enid and Ernest Wistrich, both secular Jews. Enid became Reader in Politics and Public Administration at Middlesex University (1979–1995) and thereafter Visiting Professor of Political Science. She had been a Labour councillor and chair of the Greater London Council Film Viewing Board in the 1970s.

Ernest was originally from the Free City of Danzig; he attended boarding school in Brighton before moving to the UK permanently shortly before Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Like his wife, he became a local Labour councillor, and was a parliamentary candidate. He served as director of the European Movement from 1966 and was awarded the CBE. He was the author of The United States of Europe (1992).Wistrich, Harriet (12 June 2015). \\"Ernest Wistrich obituary\\". The Guardian. =Early life and education= The Wistrichs married in 1950 and had three children. Matthew, born in 1957, was disabled and died when he was 14. Harriet followed in 1960 and Daniel in 1964. Raised as secular, non-kosher and non-Zionist, the children joined the Woodcraft Folk and lived in what Julie Bindel called a \\"liberal, upper-middle-class household\\". His upbringing notwithstanding, Daniel moved to Israel when he was 23 and became a Hasidic Jew. Wistrich went to Oxford University, where she became a feminist, came out as a lesbian, and graduated with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After Oxford, she and a friend hitchhiked around the country looking for a city they could make their home. They chose Liverpool, where Wistrich became involved in film-making before deciding to study law. She took a two-year law conversion course and completed her legal practice course in 1995 at the University of Westminster in London. In 1997, she qualified as a solicitor after training with Winstanley Burgess.Rice, Anita. \\"Lawyer in the News\\", The Law Society Gazette, 9 November 2007. Career =Justice for Women= In 1991 Wistrich co-founded the feminist law-reform group Justice for Women (JFW)—with Julie Bindel and Hilary McCollum—to campaign against laws that discriminate against women in cases involving male violence against partners.\\"Introduction\\", Justice for Women, Newsletter, Summer 2006. JFW had originally been set up as the Free Sara Thornton campaign to secure the release of Sara Thornton, convicted in 1989 of murdering her violent husband. E. Jane Dickson wrote in The Independent in 1995 that the group was run by Wistrich, Bindel and their dog, Peggy, out of their home in North London. One of JFW's earliest cases was that of Emma Humphreys, who had been convicted of murder after killing her violent pimp boyfriend in 1985, when she was 17. In September 1992 she wrote to JFW from prison asking for help, and with Wistrich's and Bindel's support, she successfully appealed the conviction, claiming long-term provocation. News reports from 7 July 1995 (right) show the three women leaving the Old Bailey after the judges ordered that Humphreys be released. Wistrich told a press conference that the case had been \\"a miscarriage of justice on a par with that of the Guildford Four and Judith Ward\\".\\"Emma Humphreys – An Inspiring Legacy\\", directed by Pratibha Parmar, courtesy of YouTube, 12 November 2009; 00:00:14 for the Old Bailey; 00:01:34 for the date Humphreys wrote to JFW; and 00:02:04 for Wistrich comparing the case to the Guildford Four and Judith Ward. Three years later, Wistrich and Bindel found Humphreys dead in bed at her home from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Based on Humphreys' diary, which was found only after her death, they co-edited a book, The Map of My Life: The Story of Emma Humphreys (2003). JFW awards the annual Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize to those raising awareness about violence against women and children.\\"Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize\\", emmahumphreys.org. =Cases= Wistrich joined Birnberg Peirce & Partners in 2002.

Description It is made of 12 tonnes of bronze and is six meters high. The base is a concrete shell with concrete columns under the bronze figures, inside the base, supporting the 12 tonnes of bronze. The base of the statue contains dates starting from May 19, 1919 including the many victories during the founding of the new Turkish state, including the revolutions giving the new state its modernity. These steps are represented by the different levels in the base. Ataturk at the top flanked by a boy and a girl representing the youth of the nation and the trust that they have received. History The president of the Ataturk Monument Creations Organisation, Muharrem Önal Bey and the architect Tarık Akıltopu organised a contest for the monument. 28 projects entered into the contest and Prof. Dr. Hüseyin Gezers project was chosen. While the monument was being built, a proper location was being searched for in Antalya. Eventually the Republic Square (Turkish: Cumhuriyet Meydanı) was chosen. After the location was chosen the architect Tarık Akıltopu started to work on the foundation/base of the monument. The granite stones for the base were brought from Yenice. The monument, which was funded completely from donations, was unveiled in May 1964. In 2014 the monument was extensively cleaned.

As a singer she performed in operas throughout Italy and the United States, including appearances at La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera, and the San Francisco Opera. She taught voice for several decades at Duquesne University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Carlow University, and served on the board and vocal coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Opera. Several of her pupils have had successful performance careers of their own, including Metropolitan Opera singers Vivica Genaux and Andrey Nemzer, and Andrew Kurtz, founder of the Center City Opera Theater. She also hosted a weekly radio program \\"Opera with Claudia\\" on WDUQ-FM radio. The only existing recording of the singer is from a November 1951 broadcast of The Bell Telephone Hour in which she performed the final Act of Gounod's Faust. Life and career Claudia Tullia Pinza was born in Buenos Aires while her father, famous Italian opera singer Ezio Pinza, was under contract at the Teatro Colón. Her mother was Augusta Cassinelli and her godparents were soprano Claudia Muzio and conductor Tullio Serafin. She spent most of her childhood growing up in the city of Bologna where she studied voice at the Bologna Conservatory. She later was a voice pupil of Antonino Votto in Milan. She made her professional opera debut at La Scala as a Nymph in Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo when she was just 18 years old. She later performed the role of Amore in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at the opera house, and appeared in opera houses in the Italian provinces during World War II. In January 1947 Pinza gave her first performance in the United States, performing the role of Mimì in Puccini's La Bohème with the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company at the Academy of Music. She sang several more roles with that company over the next two years, including Marguerite in Guonod's Faust and Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata. In October 1947 she made her debut at the San Francisco Opera as Marguerite with her father portraying Méphistophélès. She subsequently returned to the SFO to perform the role of Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni. In November 1947 she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Micaela in Bizet's Carmen. She later returned to the Met for other performances as Micaela and as Mimi in 1948. In 1949 she was a featured performer on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1950 she performed the role of Polly Peachum in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera in Boston. She continued to perform in operas in the United States up until her retirement from the stage in 1958. Some of the other companies she performed with were the Central City Opera, the Cincinnati Opera, the Dallas Opera, and the New Orleans Opera. Marriages In 1948, Pinza married John Boller who had previously worked for her father. The marriage ended in divorce six years later. She had two children with Boller: John Hall Boller Jr. and Marina Boller Jones. In 1950 she became a naturalized American citizen. In 1954 Pinza met Rolando Bozzolla while performing in Italy. The two fell in love and married soon after. They remained married until Claudia's death 63 years later. They had two sons: Samuele and Simone Bozzolla. In 1969 the family moved to Bellevue, Pennsylvania in order to obtain medical treatment for the couple's youngest son that was only available in the United States. Soon after, she joined the faculty of Duquesne University where she revived the Duquesne University Opera Workshop and taught voice until her death. She directed opera productions at the university for many years. She taught voice at the University of Pittsburgh (1979-2017) and Carlow University. In 1983 she founded the Ezio Pinza Council for American Singers of Opera which was a five-week intensive summer training program for aspiring American opera singers in Oderzo, Italy. She ran the program for 35 years. Death Still active until July 2017, Claudia Pinza died on August 3, 2017 at Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, aged 92, following complications from a series of strokes. She was survived by her husband, Rolando Bozzolla, her four children (from two marriages), and extended family.

But when Geet arrives to his village in India for the fake marriage, German actually falls in love with her as she is very modern and beautiful. German and his father pays Geet and her broker Lakkha the agreed charges after keeping a balance amount which German agrees to settle once he reaches UK. However Geet and Lakkha keep taking more money from German during the marriage ceremony and German keeps giving it to them as he wants the fake marriage to look real in front of his relatives. German then gets his UK visa due to the marriage (fake) with Geet but on arrival in London, German claims to have no money to pay the balance for the citizenship and will pay it by working in London. German then gets a job as a truck driver and also finds favour with the truck owner as he works sincerely. One day during transportation he gives lift to a stranger and they park the truck and drink inside the cabin and in their drunken state while trying to switch on the truck's music system the stranger passenger presses some other switch and de- rails the container. German very foolishly drives the truck without the container and reaches his destination but realises his folly when the supermarket person points out that he has come without the container and the fresh food items. The truck owner fires German and he therefore gets another job as a tailor in an Indian Fashion Boutique. German approaches Geet and confesses his love to her only to find out that she is already friendly with Ricky and is planning to marry him. Geet insults German on the scene, making him leave disappointedly. Later Geet and Lakkha are arrested by the UK Border Agency for suspicion in the fake marriage visa fraud. Geet claims to the police that her marriage with German is not fake but real, the police hence tells her to bring her husband German along to the police station for an interview after a week, to prove to the police that their love and marriage is real. Ricky flees immediately after hearing that she is arrested; Geet, helpless, then approaches to German for help. German is unwilling to help her at first because she insulted him, but is later persuaded by her apology. Geet takes German to her home to live with her parents to prepare for the interview by practicing to be a real couple. During German's stay in Geet's house, they find that Ricky is a fraud that framed her years ago, which is the exact reason that Geet did all those visa fraud because she needed a lot money to pay a blackmailer. German leaves a good impression to Geet's family including Geet; Geet then falls for him. Geet and German pass the interview at UK Border Agency by convincing officers their love is true and are set free.

The United States Air Force began the GPS Block IIIF acquisition effort in 2016, and awarded a 7.2 billion US dollar manufacturing contract for all 22 space vehicles to Lockheed Martin on September 14, 2018. The 22 satellites in Block IIIF are projected to be delivered starting in 2026, with launches estimated to last through at least 2034. Development The U.S. Air Force employed a two-phase competitive bid acquisition process for the GPS Block IIIF satellites. = Phase One: Production Feasibility Assessment = On May 5, 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded three Phase One Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment contracts for GPS III Space Vehicles (SV's) 11+, one each to Boeing Network and Space Systems, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. The phase one contracts were worth up to six million dollars each. During the phase one effort, both Boeing and Northrop Grumman successfully demonstrated working navigation payloads. = Phase Two: Satellite Manufacturing = On April 19, 2017, the US Air Force Space Command announced the start of the second phase of its acquisition strategy with the publication of a special notice for an \\"Industry Day\\" for companies planning on bidding for the contract to manufacture GPS III vehicles 11+. During the Industry Day event, the Air Force shared the tentative acquisition strategy which it will use to evaluate proposals, then solicited feedback from potential bidders. In July 2017, the Deputy Director of the U.S. Air Force GPS Directorate stated the acquisition strategy for GPS Block IIIF would be to award the manufacturing contracts for all 22 Block IIIF satellites to the same contractor. In November 2017, the Deputy Director of the US Air Force's GPS Directorate announced the name of the second tranche of GPS III satellites was \\"GPS Block IIIF.\\" Also in November 2017, it was announced that development of the fully digital navigation payload for GPS Block IIIF satellites had completed. The Block IIIA program schedule was delayed multiple times due to issues with the navigation payload.  Bidding  While the Air Force originally expected to publish the formal Request For Proposals (RFP) for GPS Block IIIF production in September 2017, it was not released until February 13, 2018. The RFP was for a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract for a single company to manufacture all 22 space vehicles. All three participants from phase one (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman) were believed to be likely to submit proposals. The government held a pre-proposal conference in El Segundo, CA to be held on March 15, 2018 for potential bidders to ask the Air Force questions about the solicitation. The submission deadline for proposals was 12:00pm Pacific Daylight Time on April 16, 2018. The bid status of companies who participated in phase one, in alphabetical order: * Boeing: declined to submit a proposal * Lockheed Martin: submitted a proposal * Northrop: declined to submit a proposal  Contract Award  On September 14, 2018, the Air Force awarded a $7.2 billion manufacturing contract to Lockheed Martin. = Funding = Procurement funds for GPS Block IIIF satellite manufacturing will be allocated from the federal budget, starting with Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18).

His music is often defined as Latin trap and reggaeton, but he has incorporated various other genres into his music, including rock, bachata, and soul. He is also known for his deep, slurred vocal style and his eclectic fashion sense. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny has frequently collaborated with artists such as J Balvin, Ozuna, Farruko, Residente, Arcángel, and Daddy Yankee. Born and raised in the municipality of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny gained popularity on SoundCloud and was eventually signed to a record label while working in a supermarket as a bagger and studying at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Following the release of his breakthrough single \\"Soy Peor\\" in late 2016, he rose to stardom after collaborating with Cardi B and Drake on the singles \\"I Like It\\" and \\"Mia\\", which charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number one and number three, respectively. His debut album X 100pre (2018) was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album. His collaborative album with J Balvin, Oasis (2019), contains the popular singles \\"Qué Pretendes\\" and \\"La Canción\\". In early 2020, he performed at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show as a guest, alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, and became the first Latin urban music artist on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Bad Bunny's second studio album, YHLQMDLG (') (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the US Billboard 200 at number two, followed by the release of the compilation album Las que no iban a salir (2020), two months later without prior announcement or promotion. Early life Benito Antonio Martínez was born on March 10, 1994, in Almirante Sur barrio in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. His father, Tito, was a truck driver, and his mother, Lysaurie, is a retired schoolteacher. His mother often listened to salsa, merengue, and ballads, such as Juan Gabriel's \\"Abrázame muy fuerte\\" while Bad Bunny helped her with chores around the house. He has two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael, and considers his close friends to be part of his family. He said he was raised in a happy home. As \\"a lanky wallflower with a booming voice\\", the rapper has described himself as a child by saying, “I wasn't the kid who got involved in the streets. I liked to be at home with my family.” Bad Bunny says he has wanted to be a singer since he was young. As a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe. His first solo performance was his rendition of Juanes's song \\"Mala Gente\\" in a middle school talent show. His stage name came from a time in which the rapper was forced to wear a bunny costume to school and was photographed with an angry expression. Despite being shy in high school, he often created freestyle raps to entertain his classmates, developing a reputation at his school for his creativity and humor. His teenage interests also included skateboarding and professional wrestling, both of which influenced his fashion sense. Speaking about his distance from the Puerto Rican music industry, Bad Bunny stated, \\"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from. That's what's most surprising and incredible about this – I simply came from nothing, and that's that. When I was at school, I used to stay on a balcony singing and people would stand around listening.\\" He has stated that, when he was young, his mother wanted him to grow up to be an engineer, his father preferred that he be a baseball player, while a teacher told him that he would become a firefighter. Instead, he took courses in audiovisual communication at University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo.  Career  =2016–2017: Career beginnings= While working as a bagger at Supermercados Econo in Vega Baja in 2016, Bad Bunny released music as an independent artist on SoundCloud, where his song \\"Diles\\" caught the attention of DJ Luian who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music. DJ Luian introduced Bad Bunny to the production team Mambo Kingz, who were intrigued by Bad Bunny's musical experimentation and style of dress. Since then, he has earned multiple top-ten entries on the US Hot Latin Songs chart. His breakthrough single, \\"Soy Peor\\", established him as a forerunner in the Latin American trap scene and reached number 22 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Ten months after the video for \\"Soy Peor\\"'s release, it reached 330 million views on YouTube. His song \\"Krippy Kush\\" featuring Farruko also became a success, and was eventually remixed by American rapper Nicki Minaj. Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \\"Ahora Me Llama\\", garnered more than 756 million views on YouTube and reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The song was described by Marty Preciado of NPR as a \\"bass- heavy, unapologetic trap anthem to the power of femininity, soiled in hi-hats and heavy sub-bass [that] challenges hegemonic masculinity, singing about respect, love and sex-positive decisions.\\" \\"Ahora Me Llama\\" was listed on \\"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017. In the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries. He was featured in Becky G's single \\"Mayores\\", released in July 2017. Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, Trap Kingz. Also in November 2017, Bad Bunny's track, \\"Tu No Metes Cabra\\" peaked at number 38 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. The re-mix demanded the release from prison of Anuel AA. At around the same time, the song \\"Sensualidad,\\" released as a collaboration between Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Prince Royce, peaked at number 8 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, while the remix of \\"Te Boté\\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on that chart. In the year 2017 alone, Bad Bunny featured on fifteen Billboard Hot Latin Songs-charting tracks. =2018–2019: International success, X 100pre, and Oasis= Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018 In May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \\"I Like It\\", which hit number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. In Cardi B's single, Bad Bunny raps in Spanish, Spanglish, and English. It became Bad Bunny's first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100. On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \\"Mia\\", a collaboration with Drake. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In November 2018, Bad Bunny released \\"Te Guste\\" with Jennifer Lopez, with a video directed by Mike Ho. Bad Bunny released his debut album X 100pre on Christmas Eve 2018 soon after leaving DJ Luian's label \\"Hear this Music\\", revealing on an Instagram live stream that he was never allowed to make an album and also confessing that he actually produced his music by himself. He joined Rimas Entertainment as soon as he left \\"Hear this Music\\" to release his debut album on December 24, 2018. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, X 100pre received an average score of 84 based on five reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". The record contains a variety of musical genres, including pop punk, Andean music, Dominican dembow, and \\"windswept 80s stadium rock\\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised Bad Bunny's \\"off-kilter creativity\\", opining that Bad Bunny \\"feels less like part of the current pop landscape than an artist operating slightly adjacent to it. He is separated from the pack as much by a desire to take risks as by his roots.\\" From March 8–10, 2019, Bad Bunny performed a sold-out weekend concert run at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, his debut in Puerto Rico's major entertainment venue. The initial 2-date concert sold out in hours, prompting a third date, after much speculation and demand, including specially-priced student tickets. On June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released Oasis, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin. The record was released overnight and was deemed a \\"surprise\\" release. The two artists first met at a J Balvin concert in Puerto Rico, when Bad Bunny was working on releasing music on SoundCloud, and then collaborated on the 2017 track “Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola”. The chemistry between the two was so strong that they came up with the idea to release a joint album. Oasis peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Billboard US Latin Albums chart. In 2019, Bad Bunny performed on the main stage at Coachella. In July 2019, Bad Bunny put his European tour on hold, flying from Ibiza to Puerto Rico to join protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló. Bad Bunny and Residente released a protest song, \\"\\" , (in English: Sharpening the knives) during the demonstrations. The song garnered 2.5 million views on YouTube within a day of its release. =2020: Super Bowl LIV appearance, YHLQMDLG and Las que no iban a salir= In February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. Bad Bunny announced the album YHLQMDLG on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020. Bad Bunny released the album on February 29, 2020. The album's title stands for \\"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\\" (Spanish for \\"I Do What I Want\\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, and Ñengo Flow. The album is an homage to the marquesinas (garage parties) Bad Bunny grew up attending, and features many nods to early/mid-2000s reggaeton. On the final song on the album, \\"<3\\", the artist announced his intention to retire after releasing one more album with the lyric \\"In nine months I'll release another, to retire calmly like Miguel Cotto\\", referencing the retirement of the Puerto Rican boxer. He noted that the stress of fame has had a negative impact on his mental health. YHLQMDLG debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart. The album was met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised the album's musical diversity. \\"Vete\\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019. The album title was first mentioned during a sequence of the accompanying music video. The second single, \\"Ignorantes\\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020. In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \\"Yo Perreo Sola\\", in which the artist performs in drag. The final frame of the video denounces sexual harassment of women, and reads: \\"\\"If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone\\". On the song and video, Bad Bunny stated \\"I wrote it from the perspective of a woman. I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it. But I do feel like that woman sometimes\\". \\"Yo Perreo Sola\\" landed No. 1 on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years. On April 4, 2020, he released the COVID-19-inspired song \\"En Casita\\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri. On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his third solo studio album (fourth overall) Las que no iban a salir, without previous announcements. The album's title translates to \\"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\\" and is primarily a compilation of previously unreleased or unfinished songs. Songs from the album were played on an Instagram live stream that Bad Bunny made in late April. The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez. Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \\"There was no real meaning behind it. I just thought, 'Damn. What people need is entertainment'. Bad Bunny had been filming his supporting role in Narcos: Mexico before filming was postponed due to the pandemic. In July 2020, he appeared on the first digital cover of Playboy magazine as the first man to appear on the cover other than the magazine's founder, Hugh Hefner. The cover was shot by photographer Stillz in Miami, Florida and the magazine includes a feature article entitled \\"Bad Bunny is Not Playing God.\\" The following month, his song \\"Pero Ya No\\" appeared in an advertisement for politician Joe Biden's 2020 United States presidential election campaign. On September 20, 2020, Bad Bunny performed a surprise, live (via multiple social media platforms), free concert from atop a flatbed truck that looked like a subway car going through the streets of New York and ended at Harlem Hospital. With a motorcade including police and vehicles flashing their lights, the subway car with Bad Bunny on the top drove through The Bronx and Washington Heights in Manhattan. The concert was broadcast live and hosted by Uforia. https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/bad-bunny-performs-live-concert-from- flatbed-truck-driving-through-nyc/2627029/ Artistry =Musical and lyrical style= Bad Bunny is primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist. As described by a Rolling Stone article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \\"conversational tone\\", employing \\"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies and a rapper's cadence.\\" In an interview with Billboard, Bad Bunny stated that his biggest music inspirations growing up were Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Daddy Yankee, and Marc Anthony. As a child, he was exposed to salsa and merengue through his father and pop ballads from his mother. When he discovered English music, he became influenced by trap and hip-hop. During his adolescence, he went through \\"musical seasons\\" in which he would listen almost exclusively to a certain type of music; he reflected that \\"There was bachata season, indie-pop season, even Bee Gees season.\\" Daddy Yankee is a major influence on Bad Bunny, but Lavoe is his greatest inspiration and is described as \\"a critical strand of Bad Bunny’s musical DNA\\"; he later said that growing up, he would entertain neighbors from his balcony by playing songs from Lavoe. Though primarily a trap and reggaeton artist, his songs also include influence from soul, pop, and R&B.; He addressed his musical experimentation by stating, “If tomorrow I want to release a rock album or I want to release a bachata album, nobody can tell me anything — why can't I? We need to try to unite audiences, unite countries, join musical tastes, unite people.” He also experimented with \\"garage-pop punk\\" on the song \\"Tenemos Que Hablar\\" from his X 100pre album. According to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \\"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\\" Discussing the Oasis collaboration album between Bad Bunny and J Balvin, Joe Coscarelli noted that the two artists \\"pack their lyrics with geographically specific references and cultural allusions, offering no concessions to the white American audiences that have nonetheless embraced them.\\" According to Paper, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \\"self-love, inclusivity and LGBTQ acceptance\\". His songs \\"Yo Perreo Sola\\" and \\"Bellacoso\\" (featuring Residente) denounce sexual harassment, the latter of which was inspired by the feminist movement in Puerto Rico, notably protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló. =Image= Bad Bunny is noted for his wide variety of sunglasses. His fashion sense has been noted by the media. Vanessa Rosales of CNN opined that \\"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\\". According to Vogue, Bad Bunny is a \\"well-known sunglasses fanatic\\". The rapper once joked that being able to wear sunglasses at night was a key motivation for becoming an artist. His gender variant behavior is on full display in many of his videos, and when he, at award shows, appears with well-manicured and polished, long fingernails. In the video for his single \\"Estamos Bien\\", Bad Bunny is seen enjoying time with his friends, then polishing his fingernails with a purple nail polish then blows them dry. His video for \\"Yo Perreo Sola\\" featuries the artist performing in full drag. His fashion sense is also influenced by his interest in skateboarding as a teenager. After interviewing him in 2018, NPR interviewers Felix Contreras and Jasmine Garsd said that one of the things that struck them most was his humility. Bad Bunny's quirky social media presence has garnered social media attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. He hosted a three-hour long Instagram live session on May 2, 2020, in which over 250,000 viewers were connected at all times, at one point reaching 320,000 viewers. These numbers surpassed popular live sessions by Drake and Tory Lanez. Houston-based artist Cynthia Coronado painted a picture of a popular post of the rapper tanning while wearing heart-shaped sunglasses in quarantine, and Bad Bunny offered to purchase the painting via Instagram for $5,000. On May 14, 2020, Rolling Stone featured Bad Bunny in the magazine's cover story titled \\"Bad Bunny in Captivity,\\" a detailed account of the rapper's quarantine spent in an Airbnb in Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny became the first Latin urban artist to appear on the magazine's cover. Furthermore, the photos produced for the story were created by Gabriela Berlingeri, a jewelry designer and Bad Bunny's girlfriend, making her the first Latina to ever shoot a cover story for the magazine. With the story, Rolling Stone Latin music editor Suzy Exposito also became the first Latina to write a cover story for the magazine. In relation to his childhood passion for professional wrestling, the beginning of his \\"Chambea\\" music video features an introduction from wrestler Ric Flair. Discussing the experience, Bad Bunny explained, \\"[Making the video], I kept saying, something's missing. Then it occurred to me, like damn, let's put a legendary wrestler in here. When I got to the video I was nervous—real nervous—and I didn't know if he was gonna be humble or more like the persona. But he's a super, super good dude and we became friends!\\" Bad Bunny's interest in wrestling also influenced his desire to explore androgynous and feminine style, with the rapper explaining, “Each [wrestler] has their way of being, and it's respected. They have long hair, they can paint their face, [but] they're strong and powerful beings.” Activism Bad Bunny has been openly critical towards the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico. Introducing his performance of \\"Estamos Bien\\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on September 26, 2018, the artist stated in English: \\"After one year of the hurricane, there are still people without electricity in their homes. More than 3,000 people died and Trump's still in denial.\\" Shortly after the hurricane, Bad Bunny personally distributed food, water, and generators in his hometown of Vega Baja. A year later, his family home was still running on three generators. He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny has criticized the decisions made to close schools in Puerto Rico and contrasted them with the opening of more and more prisons. He has since been nominated for Telemundo's Tu Musica Urban Awards \\"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\\" On July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down a major highway PR-52, more commonly known as Expreso Las Américas or Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in the days-long protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation. He has not taken a position regarding the statehood movement in Puerto Rico, and has stated that he would like to do more research on the subject before forming an official stance. Bad Bunny supports LGBT rights and states that he \\"[feels] a big commitment to the community\\", due to widespread gender-based violence in Puerto Rico. In January 2019, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar that was widely considered to be homophobic, tweeting: \\"Homophobia, in this day and age? How embarrassing, loco.\\" During a performance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \\"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt.”, referencing news reports that had misgendered Luciano. Openly gay singer Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \\"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\\" due to his outspoken support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture. Suzy Exposito of Rolling Stone wrote of her belief that Bad Bunny's denouncement of gender violence will make harassers \\"perhaps think twice before they hassle any woman, or gender- nonconforming person, again.\\"  Personal life  Bad Bunny says he likes to live a calm life and immediately after a concert he leaves the area to avoid crowds. He disappeared from social media for a time when he was overwhelmed with his sudden rise to fame. Views of his videos on YouTube tallied seven billion in 2018. In 2019, Bad Bunny played on the \\"Away\\" roster during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The rapper met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri in 2017 at a restaurant while dining with his family, and the two began dating soon after. Berlingeri assisted Bad Bunny in recording the 2018 song \\"Te Guste\\" by providing scratch vocals for Jennifer Lopez's portions of the song. Bad Bunny kept his relationship with Berlingeri secret from the public until 2020. He explained his decision to publicly acknowledge their relationship by saying, “I am happy with her. [People] don't know she has helped me a lot in emotional aspects when I needed it the most.\\" Berlingeri became the first Latina to shoot the cover of Rolling Stone when she photographed the rapper for the magazine's May 2020 cover.

Her work consists of paintings, drawings and photographs of everyday objects, including pears and rolls of toilet paper. Personal life Alf was born August 13, 1930 in Berkeley California. She is the only child of Foster Wise Powell and Julia Vivian Kane. Her father was an attorney and her mother worked as a legal secretary often for her husband. When Martha was 2 years old her family moved to Winterset, Iowa to live with her grandparents. In 1938 the family moved to San Diego, California, where her father started work at a law firm. Martha grew up in La Mesa, California, where she attended Grossmont High School, where she studied art. At San Diego State University she met her future husband, Edward Franklin Alf Jr. In 1951, they wed, before Edward was drafted for service in Korea. The couple had one child. Education At San Diego State University Alf studied painting with Everett Gee Jackson. She then studied painting at the University of California at Los Angeles under Richard Diebenkorn. Paintings and drawings Alf first became recognized as a nationally significant artist for her 1970s \\"cylinder paintings,\\" each of which depicts a toilet paper roll positioned like a monument on an empty stage. Three of these paintings were selected by curator Marcia Tucker for the \\"1975 Biennial of Contemporary Art\\" at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alf painted many of the cylinder paintings in unorthodox colors that express a range of emotions. She approached the series as Josef Albers had in his \\"Homage to the Square\\" series, by repeating a constant image from painting to painting, but varying the colors. : Suzanne Muchnic, Martha Alf Retrospective, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, 1984. In the late 1970s Alf turned to making graphite drawings of fruits and vegetables which she arranged like actors on a stage, acting out psychodramas. The most frequent subject of choice was the pear which, when shown alone, was at times considered by the artist to be a self-portrait. In 1978, Alf earned national recognition for her unique drawing technique. In a review for Arts Magazine, art critic David S. Rubin wrote that Alf's \\"still life arrangements rendered mostly by soft, delicate, diagonally hatched pencil strokes, sparkled with radiant light while also saturating us with a gripping textural sensuality. Alf draws with a controlled and steady hand. She has been keenly attentive to every nuance of surface and value and shows enormous reverence for the integrity and expressive potential of the drawing medium\\".David S. Rubin, \\"Martha Alf,\\" Arts Magazine, LVIII/1, September 1978, p. 12. Alf shifted from black and white to color in her pastel drawings of the early 1980s. Continuing to draw staged fruits, with the pear being the dominant subject, Alf exaggerated color and light to the point that the drawings assumed a spiritual dimension. In \\"Pear #1 (For Andy Wilf),\\" 1982, a solitary pear serves as a surrogate for a young artist friend who had recently died an untimely drug-related death. The stem of the pear in the drawing is shown as if reaching towards golden light, suggesting that Alf's tormented friend had at last found peace with the universe at large. Alf returned to painting in the late 1980s, producing a series of painted depictions of pears rendered in colors so bright and intense that an art critic referred to them as \\"psychedelic pears\\" Three of them are included in the book Psychedelic: Optical and Visionary Art since the 1960s by David S. Rubin. As in her earlier cylinder paintings, the imagery remains constant from painting to painting, while colors vary.David S. Rubin, Psychedelic: Optical and Visionary Art Since the 1960s, San Antonio Museum of Art and the MIT Press, 2010, p. 24. In the 1990s, Alf focused on a single color in a series of monochromatic red paintings with subtle patterning and variations in texture. Photography In the 21st century, Alf has concentrated almost exclusively on photography, which she practiced for many years alongside painting and drawing. Concurrent with the 1970s cylinder paintings, Alf made photographs of toilet paper rolls as a means of studying color. Before photographing an unused roll, the artist dyed it using colored markers. She subsequently made photos of other subjects, including her familiar fruits and vegetables. In 1998, Alf began making photographs of pigeons roosting on a window sill opposite her home. She fed them to keep them coming, named each pigeon, created narratives for them, and produced a video featuring the pigeons, entitled \\"Birdland\\".David S. Rubin, Birdspace: A Post- Audubon Artists Aviary, Contemporary Art Center New Orleans, 2004, p. 14. Around the same time, Alf began photographing still life arrangements of unusual objects that she had collected over the years. In \\"New Glass City.\\" 2002, Alf responded to the events of September 11, 2001 by creating a visual metaphor for a new metropolis, which she did by photographing an arrangement of several glass objects that glisten as they reflect sunlight.

Description The inland marbled velvet gecko measures with a snout- vent length an average of 90mm but up to 108mm, with a thick tail and five or six light bands across the body over a purplish brown background. These bands are especially evident in juveniles. Light yellow flecking appears as they mature into adults, making the banding less distinct. The tail may become thinner in times of stress and lowered body condition. The base colour of purple brown appears in adults during the day, with a more dull grey appearance at night. They can be distinguished from the morphologically similar O. marmorata by a longer body length and a longer and slimmer tail which is never thicker than the head. Etymology Cinctus is the Latin singular masculine form of cingo, which means to go around, surround or encompass. This is likely in relation to the bands present on the tail of the Oedura cincta. Oedura means swollen tail, in reference to the significantly enlarged tail common to most Oedura spp.. Taxonomy and evolution Divergence of Oedura cincta from other species occurred in the plio- pleistocene for isolated populations, and early pliocene for central populations. The species was recently brought out of synonymy by Oliver and Doughty (2016) from Oedura marmorata, a close relative, from which four distinct species have now been detailed; O. cincta, O. fimbria, O. bella and the originally described O. marmorata. As saxicoline (rock-dwelling) lizards, singular species such as O. cinta can encompass multiple distinct lineages as their habitats differ and can be considered two evolutionary significant units (ESUs). In the case of O. cincta, this species encompasses both the eastern and central lineages. O. derelicta is considered a synonym of O.cincta in junior form. Distribution and habitat Oedura cincta have been found to have a wide distribution in central Australia and inland eastern Australia. Oedura cincta are tree and rock dwelling geckos found to inhabit mostly granite, quartz, sandstone and limestone rocks as well as trees. The eastern ESU (evolutionary significant units) have been found to inhabit western New South Wales and Queensland woodland areas throughout the Cooper and Darling basins, residing mostly in tree hollows and bark of small trees, predominantly Casuarina spp.. They are also known to inhabit rocks when available and have been found in this habitat in the Flinders Ranges. Proportionately more arboreal (tree-dwelling) O. cincta are found throughout inland eastern Australia (eastern ESU) while the rock dwelling lineages are less widely distributed and found mostly in central Australia (central ESU). Two isolated populations of the central ESU have been identified in the South of the Northern Territory in the Macdonell and Reynolds Ranges foraging, and these have been predominantly rock-dwelling. Reproduction Oedura cincta are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than give birth to live young, and are thought to have a clutch size that averages two young. Diet Oedura spp. forage for arthropods over vertical surfaces such as rocks and trees as well as on the ground. Oedura spp. have also been seen lapping sap from trees, usually wattles.

She is known also as the goddess of the river Tapati and mother-goddess of the South (home of the sun) where she brings heat to the earth. According to certain Hindu texts, Tapati was a daughter of Surya (the Sun god) by Chhaya, one of the wives of Surya. Tapati's name literally means the \\"warming\\", \\"the hot one\\", \\"burning one\\". It had been said that no one in three worlds could match her in beauty, having perfect features, and severe religious self-discipline.

Routledge/UNESCO. 1996. pg 182 History Tapati is originally mentioned in the Mahabharata two dozen times, as a wife of Samvarana having a son named Kuru (the founder of the Kuru dynasty and the Kuru Kingdom). The story of both characters has also been found in other Hindu texts such as Srimad-Bhagavatam & Purāṇam. According to these texts Tapati's home was situated on the banks of river Tapati . In Mahabharata, Arjun asked Gandharva about the origin of the name Tapatya, so the Gandharva said that the sun had a beautiful daughter named Tapati, whom he was concerned to marry off. An early Kaurava king Samvarana worships the sun and was elected as her husband. One day out for hunting the king saw her and fell in love and proposed a marriage but she referred him to her father for his approval. After that the king started to worship the sun and took the help of sage Vasistha and sent him before the sun, Vasistha then requested sun to approve the marriage of Samvarana and Tapati and the sun agreed to it. Significance According to the Hindu texts Tapati was famous for her devotion and neither goddess, nor demon, nor Apsara nor Gandharva was her equal in beauty, disposition or knowledge of the vedas. Mode of Worship Since the river Tapati was probably named after Tapati, people worship her both in the form of a goddess and in that of an important river having many admirable qualities, enumerated in Hindu texts. Relatives According to the Hindu texts which mention her, Tapati has the following relatives : Surya as her father and Chhaya as her mother, she was a wife of Samvarana and the mother of Kuru, she was a younger sister of Yami and Bhadra and had two brothers Shani and Yama Representation in art There seems to be multiple plays performed on both the legend characters story Kaurava king Samvarana and Tapati such as Tapatisamvarana play, Kuttiyattam drama tradition in Kerala.

Christian attended Eton College in the United Kingdom, where he was a distinguished athlete. He served in the Imperial Light Horse of the British Army during the Second Boer War, during which he fought in the Siege of Ladysmith. In the decade after the war, he worked in what is now South Africa for De Beers and later as an engineer for a mining company. In 1911, Christian moved to Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe). There, he purchased a sizable farm, which he named Ewanrigg. He was best known for his study and cultivation of aloe on his extensive estate, which was donated to the state upon his death and became a national park. Christian initially attempted to grow imported European plants on his farm, but these tree species, which tend to be conifers, were not well-suited to the region's heat, dryness, and low altitude. In 1916, after it proved impossible to remove an unsightly rock from a spacious lawn in front of the house, Christian took an Aloe cameronii from a nearby hill and planted it in front of the stone. He was very impressed when the aloe flowered the next year despite not having been watered, and decided to focus thereafter on aloes rather than imported trees. During the 1930s, he expanded his garden and publishing his research on aloes in periodicals like the Rhodesian Agricultural Journal. Over the years, he became recognized by botanists around the world as an authority on African aloe species. One species was named Aloe christianii in his honor. In his later years, Christian focused on the cultivation of cycads as well.  Early life, family, and education  Harold Basil Christian was born on 28 October 1871 in Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony (today South Africa). His father Henry Bailey Christian, was prominent in the city's agriculture, trade, and politics. Christian's grandfather, Ewan Christian, arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on his uncle Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's ship. His family was of Manx, English, and Welsh descent. Christian's paternal ancestors were descended from the Cumberland family of deemsters, or judges, on the Isle of Man. One of his notable ancestors was Fletcher Christian, a participant in the mutiny on the Bounty. Fletcher was one of the mutineers who in 1790, settled on Pitcairn Island and established an isolated community. Christian's father, Henry Bailey Christian, a veteran of the 1846 Xhosas War, was a successful farmer and merchant and a prominent public figure. Christian grew up Kragga Kama, the family farm, located 12 miles outside Port Elizabeth. He had three older brothers and four sisters. He studied at Eton College in the United Kingdom. There, he was a skilled athlete. The Eton College Chronicle in 1887 and 1888 reports his success in Association football (soccer), sculling, and rowing. In South Africa, he was an award-winning equestrian, an activity he shared with his father, who owned racehorses.  Military service and early career  = Second Boer War = After graduating from Eton, Christian returned to South Africa and served in the British Army in the Second Boer War. He served in the Imperial Light Horse and was the second to ride into battle at the Siege of Ladysmith. He later carried an injured comrade through heavy gunfire for 1.5 miles at the Battle of the Tugela Heights. = Work in mining = After the war until around 1910, Christian worked for De Beers in Kimberley, and later as an engineer for a mining company in the Witwatersrand. During this period, he met Cecil Rhodes while working in Kimberley. Christian said that on Rhodes' instruction, he became the first man to write \\"Rhodesia\\" on a map. An article in the journal Rhodesiana wrote that this story is \\"reasonably possible\\", as the British South Africa Company had used the term \\"Rhodesia\\" since 1895.  Life in Rhodesia  = Farming, discovery of aloes, and marriage = While working in the Northern Cape during his career in the mining business, Christian likely heard much about the colony of Rhodesia to the north. Christian emigrated to Rhodesia in 1911. Three years later, he purchased Mount Shannon Farm from Gerald Ernest George Fitzgibbon. The farm was located about 40 kilometers northeast of Salisbury (now Harare), in what today is Mashonaland East Province. He paid £5,000 for the 662-morgen farm, and renamed it Ewanrigg, after an old family property in the Isle of Man. A flowering Aloe cameronii, the first aloe Christian planted in his garden. After purchasing his farm, Christian constructed a house on a kopje and added a croquet lawn in front. He constructed a water garden, including a waterfall, which was popular with visitors. While the water feature appeared to flow continuously with a pump, in reality, water was brought up from a nearby stream in an ox-drawn cart and poured into a tank behind the waterfall, and the tap was opened just before visitors arrived. Spacious lawns were cleared in front of the house where Christian planned to develop a garden. He originally planted imported European alpines, inspired by the designs of the English gardeners he knew growing up on his father's farm in South Africa. However, the imported plants, which thrive in high altitudes, cooler temperatures, and generous amounts of water, were not suited to the hot, dry climate of Southern Africa. In the center of the lawn, a large rock protruded above the ground and was unable to be removed despite much digging. In 1916, Christian's farm surveyor went to a hill close by, uprooted an Aloe cameronii, and planted it \\"to hide the stark appearance of this unsightly rock\\". When the plant flowered the next year despite no watering, Christian was so pleased that he decided to focus on gardening native African aloes instead of imported plants. From 1916 on, numerous rockeries were constructed and more and more aloes were acquired for the garden. On 18 December 1920, Christian married Annabella Roberta Kemp Saint, a Scottish woman. Their marriage was held at the Cathedral of St Mary and All Saints in Salisbury, and was solemnized by Bishop William Carter of the Anglican Diocese of Cape Town. They had a short, difficult marriage, and in September 1923, they signed a separation agreement. She moved back to Scotland and died in 1955. In addition to gardening, which began as a hobby, Christian was an active farmer and leading figure in the Rhodesian agriculture community. He was involved in starting a maize-growing competition in Mashonaland in which farmers competed to grow the most maize on one acre. He was often chosen to judge maize competitions. He was also instrumental in encouraging Rhodesian farmers to use fertilizer and better irrigation. He served as President of the Rhodesian Agricultural Union (today the Commercial Farmers' Union) from 1929 to 1931. = Cultivation and study of aloe = By the 1920s, Christian spent increasing amounts of time focusing on his garden. In the 1930s, he began traveling throughout Rhodesia and South Africa, searching for new varieties of aloe for his garden. He diligently collected, identified, cultivated, studied, and photographed different species, and published his research. In 1937, he journeyed throughout eastern Rhodesia, and the following year, he traveled to Nyasaland (today Malawi) to study the aloes there. From 1933 to 1952, he published articles and papers in various periodicals, and several were published posthumously. In 1933, he published his first article, \\"Notes on African Aloes,\\" in the Rhodesian Agricultural Journal. In it, he advocated for the use of aloes as decorative plants due to their perennial nature, and requirement of little water. Christian, and Gilbert W. Reynolds, South African optometrist, were the two foremost aloe enthusiasts at the time. Reynolds' study of aloe began in 1930, and in 1933, a friend in Port Elizabeth arranged for them to meet. They met for breakfast at the King Edward Hotel in Port Elizabeth, where they were both so engaged that neither man touched his food. The outcome of that first meeting was that the two decided that Christian would focus on aloes growing above the Limpopo River, while Reynolds would concentrate on aloes occurring south of the river. In 1937 his right arm was amputated above the elbow, a consequence of a modest injury that did not heal properly. His disability forced him to give up other hobbies and focus almost entirely on gardening. In addition to aloes, he also had an interest in Barberton daisies. For the next decade and half, Christian spent much time preparing a book on tropical African aloe species. He filled several large leather-bound notebooks and plant registers with the fruits of his studies, but the idea of a book ultimately did not come about. In mid-1939, Gilbert Reynolds visited Ewanrigg Farm. He published a detail description of his visit in the South African Horticultural Journal, in which he noted the rockeries, pools, and the prevalence of Aloe cameronii, which were in bloom at the time of his visit. He called the gardens \\"the finest and most complete collection of Aloes in existence\\". A cycas plant, part of the cycad division of plants that Christian studied later in his life. Christian's growing reputation as an expert on the aloe genus, as well as requests to botanists at Kew Gardens in London and the South African Division of Botany in Pretoria, meant that crates and packages of aloes arrived at Ewanrigg with frequency. Upon arrival, they aloes were recorded and planted, and when they bloomed, their flowers were described and the descriptions were published. With the help of Inez Clare Verdoorn, they recorded 28 previously unidentified species. By the early 1940s, the gardens had been expanded to seven acres, and had earned an international reputation. Christian was by now seen as a top expert on aloe and on African aloes in particular. Governors of Southern Rhodesia were often invited to visit. The Minister of Internal Affairs declared the garden national monument in 1943. During his later years, Christian continued to cultivate aloes but also began collecting and propagating cycads and other genera. He developed an extensive collection of African cycads, and nearly all species of the genus Encephalartos could be found at Ewanrigg. In 1947, he went on a thorough cycad tour of South Africa with Inez Clare Verdoorn and others, where they traveled from the Transvaal through Natal and examined all known localities of encephalartos. In addition to cycads, he was interested in euphorbia. In the 1941 book Succulent Euphorbieae of Southern Africa, Christian is listed in the acknowledgements, and several of his photographs were used in the book. Aloe christianii, named after Harold Basil Christian. One variety of aloe, recorded by Gilbert Reynolds as a species which Christian first collected at his farm, was named Aloe christianii in his honor, and a plant was donated to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In 1948, he subdivided his estate, selling some portions and retaining 707 acres. On 5 June 1948, with William Daniel Gale and J. B. Richards serving as witnesses, Christian signed a codicil to his will in which he granted part of his farm, including his garden, to the state. Christian's decision to leave his garden to the state was appreciatively received by The Rhodesia Herald, which published an article on 8 June 1948 that read, \\"If the offer of the owner Mr. Basil Christian is accepted by the Rhodesian Government, the finest and most complete collection of aloes and cycads in the world will become the property of the Colony for all time.\\" Christian said in an interview his work could not have been achieved and his collection could not have been expanded such were it not for the botanists at Kew and the South African government's Division of Botany, who frequently sent him new specimens. In the interview, he noted that while other gardens had a greater number of species, Ewanrigg had still made a significant contribution to science, and that the complete records of all the species would be donated to the state along with the garden.  Death and legacy  After a lengthy illness, Christian died on Friday, 12 May 1950, at St Anne's Hospital in Salisbury, aged 79. He was buried the following day at Salisbury Cemetery, following a funeral liturgy at the city's Anglican cathedral. In tributes publishing following his death, Christian was remembered as a proud Old Etonian, an enthusiastic member of the Rhodesian Agricultural Union, an active member of The Salisbury Club, and a skilled horseback rider. A plaque was placed at Ewanrigg in his memory by the Botanical Society of Southern Rhodesia. His 1921 will could not be located, nor could a 1923 codicil. However, a 1927 codicil confirming part of the original 1921 will was available, in addition to the codicil from 1948 that left his garden to the state. Some doubts existed about whether Christian had planned to donate his entire 707-acre Ewanrigg Farm, or only the 14.5 acres that were declared a national monument in 1943. The 1948 codicil was worded as such that the issue was not immediately settled. The matter was resolved amicably when his executor, his wife's lawyer, and the Minister of Internal Affairs agreed that the Christian's intention was that the entirety of Ewanrigg should be transferred to the government's Natural Resources Board and the Commission for the Preservation of Natural and Historical Monuments and Relics. It was also decided that all income of Ewanrigg should go to his wife, Annabella Roberta Kemp Saint, from whom he had been separated since 1923.

At launch, the network is available for users in 17 metro areas in Canada. The launch was viewed as a way for BCE to compete with the discount mobile brands Chatr and Public Mobile operated by its competitors Rogers Communications and Telus, respectively. Like Chatr, Lucky Mobile offers a limited selection of low end smartphones for sale outright. In March 2018, the carrier's service area expanded to include Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

She would eventually marry Sir Walter St John, a distant relative. Throughout her life, St John constructed two recipe books containing culinary, cosmetic, and medicinal recipes. She was the grandmother to the first Viscount Bolingbroke, Henry St John.http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp;=Archive&dsqCmd;=Show.tcl&dsqDb;=Catalog&dsqPos;=0&dsqSearch;=(AltRefNo='ms.4338')  Early life  St John's father was Oliver St John, a leading Parliamentarian and supporter of Oliver Cromwell. She was raised during the time of the English Civil War. In the early months of her life, her mother, Johanna Altham, brought her to the home of Altham's stepfather, Sir William Masham, in High Laver, Essex. St John was baptized there on 27 January 1631. In 1649, she married her distant cousin and later had thirteen children.  Housewife of Lydiard House  Lydiard Park is a 260-acre country park at Lydiard Tregoze, nearly four miles west of central Swindon, Wiltshire, England, later owned by the Viscount of Bolingbroke, Johanna St John's grandson. A set of letters between Johanna St John and her steward, Thomas Hardyman, give insight into how she learned to construct her recipe books. At Lydiard House, her summer estate, a plethora of materials and ingredients including food, herbs, and livestock gave her the raw materials she needed to craft her recipe books. St John's usage of these materials ranged from food to distilled medicines. From the letters, there is an understanding that Johanna herself did not concoct the recipes at Lydiard House, but gave \\"exact details to a team of distillers and herbgatherers\\", often collaborating with other recipe-makers in London. People she collaborated with included Sir Edward Spencer, Lady Manchester and Lady Peterborough who all had remedies for sore eyes, and Sr. Philip Warwick who had a remedy for cramps.

Born on-screen, Frank was originally played by an uncredited baby actor in 1993 before Luke Patrick took over the role in 2016. Creation and casting The character of Frank was introduced in 1993 during a plot in which \\"robo nurse\\" Carrie Burton (Lisa Crittenden) fell pregnant after receiving three different sperm donations from central characters. This was billed as a \\"whodunit\\" with nurse Steve Mills (Andrew Binns), Guy Warner (Craig Parker), Dr. Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Dr. Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) all potentially being the father. The character made his first appearance on 11 October 1993, when Carrie gave birth to him and his triplet siblings. The birth was used as a storyline to write off the character of Carrie, and she departed with her children on 11 November 1993. In 2015 producers decided to reintroduce the triplets 23 years after their disappearance. The first two triplets, Finn (Lukas Whiting) and Sass (Lucy Lovegrove) were introduced throughout 2016. Whilst casting for the role of Frank, Whiting recommended acting school friend, Luke Patrick to play his triplet brother. The two had often been referred to as brother's during their acting training by other students. Patrick's agent called him to offer an audition, and having been raised in Australia he jokingly thought, \\"Does New Zealand really have its own TV shows?\\" Patrick was cast two weeks later, as Frank in what was his first television role. His casting was leaked to the media but due to the confidential nature of the characters introduction, the role was left ambiguous. Frank returned to Shortland Street during the show's 2016 Christmas cliffhanger. In 2018 Patrick quit the role, with Frank making his final appearance on 3 September 2018. Patrick was invited to return to the show in 2019 following huge fan-demand and Frank made his return on 19 December 2019. Storylines Desperate to have children but with no stable partner in her life, Shortland Street clinic's head of nursing Carrie Burton (Lisa Crittenden) accepted sperm donations from nurse Steve Mills (Andrew Binns), Guy Warner (Craig Parker), Dr. Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Dr. Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), refusing to disclose whose sperm she used. She fell pregnant and married Steve's father Declan Kennedy (Kevin J. Wilson). Carrie gave birth to triplets during good friend Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) leaving party and named them Frank, Finbar, and Sarah. Declan proved to be a useless father and ended up fleeing the country to escape criminal associates, leaving Steve to be a surrogate parent. It turned out Sarah had a hole in her heart and came close to death during surgery. Carrie decided to flee Ferndale after receiving threats from Declan's criminal past, taking her triplets with her and leaving Steve (who had decided the children were likely his) heart broken. Several months later Steve was devastated to realise Chris had discovered he was the father and had been visiting Carrie and the triplets in Australia (Adelaide to be precise). This caused a rivalry between the two that ultimately led to Steve driving off the road and dying in an explosion. In November 1995 Chris visited Carrie and the triplets so that he could introduce his father Bruce (Ken Blackburn) to them before he succumbed to terminal cancer. Upon Finn's return to Shortland Street in 2016, he noted to Chris that Frank had struggled with Carrie succumbing to cancer, had pursued a life of crime, and was serving time in prison for armed robbery. Breaking into Chris' house during Christmas 2016, Frank quickly made his mark in Ferndale, purposefully sabotaging local bar 'The I.V.' in an attempt to secure a job there. Having successfully manipulated his way into a barman role, Frank met and fell in love with nurse Kylie Brown (Kerry-Lee Dewing) and whilst away on a long weekend together, the two married. Desperate to reform from criminality, Frank started a motorbike repair business but fell into bad terms with a local motorbike gang and lost the business whilst uninsured in a volcanic eruption. Assaulting a security man, Frank stole $20,000 that resulted in 'The I.V.' spiralling into financial debt and owner Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) having to sell out. Frank struggled with Chris' diagnosis of leukaemia and ended up donating bone marrow that saw Chris overcome his cancer. Frank emotionally revealed to his siblings that his stepfather had abused him as a child and as a result, the triplets adorned the surname of Warner. Frank was shocked with the return of his manipulative wife Mindy (Catriona Toop) whom he believed was dead, making his marriage to Kylie void. Chris managed to pay Mindy off to divorce Frank but the damage was too severe for Kylie, who left Frank. However following Frank taking a bullet from an attempted shooting of Finn, the couple reunited and decided to have children. Chris helped Frank get hired as a security guard at the hospital but following Kylie suffering a miscarriage, Frank began to feel uncomfortable with Kylie's brother-in-law Dylan Reinhart (Ryan O'Kane) and lost his job following staff- protest to Chris' nepotism. Getting involved in a drug smuggling business, Frank eventually returned to the hospital but in his guilt, hired the security guard he had previously assaulted whom was inept at the job due to the resulting brain injury. Sensing Frank's guilt and realising the crime, Dylan blackmailed him and convinced him to flee town to escape his demons. Breaking up with Kylie, Frank fled Ferndale on a motorbike. Frank unexpectedly returned in the final minutes of 2019 season much to the shock of ex-wife Kylie Brown and TK Samuels. Frank shocked all when he unexpectedly returned at Christmas 2019. Hoping to win back Kylie, he was saddened to learn she had reconciled with TK Samuels. Reunited with his younger brother Phoenix (Geordie Holibar), Frank helped him care for newborn daughter Amelie but was shocked to discover he was embezzling significant amounts from their father. Giving his blessing to Kylie's wedding to TK, he was shocked when she confessed the murder of Dylan to him alongside another murder and asked to reunite and flee Ferndale. Frank helped her confess to police and saw her departure. Working at the bar, he tried to overcome his sadness with a brief fling with Shereez Baker (Timmie Cameron) but found solace in helping a young man who stole his motorbike. Deciding to pursue a career of prisoner-rehabilitation, Frank departed for Wellington. Character development =The Warner family unit= The characters of Frank, Finn, and Sass were introduced in 1993 during a whodunit storyline, revolving around sperm donation to the head nurse, Carrie Burton. After departing later in the year, Chris Warner was revealed as the father. The triplets were individually reintroduced 23 years later and instantly bonded with their onscreen father, Michael Galvin. Patrick referred to working with Galvin as \\"pretty fun\\", and labelled him his \\"funny dad\\". He, Whiting, and Lovegrove referred to Galvin as \\"dad\\" onset and Patrick believed, \\"he's a top bloke and really acts like a father figure to us. He always helps us out and gives us guidance, but he can still be the biggest kid out of all us.\\" The chemistry was so apparent between the cast that Whiting blamed Galvin for interrupting filming due to laughter between them. Patrick, Whiting, and Lovegrove were honoured to be a part of the triplet storyline and its history during the show's 25th anniversary, with Whiting believing, \\"it's a pretty special moment to be involved in, especially to be part of a storyline that's been 20 years in the making. And it's definitely cool for the long time fans who remember the triplets being born on the show and can now see that call come to fruition.\\" Patrick and Whiting previously knew each other through acting school, and though Whiting and Lovegrove were of similar age living in Canberra, they were unaware of each other previously. After all three characters returned, there was an instant \\"family\\" connection between the actors with Patrick describing the family as, \\"nothing more than real really\\". The contrast was said to be immense between the often bickering triplets, and the \\"pizza catch ups\\" between the three actors. Lovegrove commented that the relationship between the three had become \\"a real sibling relationship. We act like real-life triplets!\\" Following Frank's return in 2019, he shared scenes for the first time with half-brother Phoenix Warner (Geordie Holibar) and the relationship was said to be one of \\"sharing wisdom\\". =Relationship with Kylie Brown= Upon introduction, Frank was paired with established character Kylie Brown (Kerry-Lee Dewing), a fan favourite character who had been involved in a long running romance storyline with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). Patrick was uncertain on the audience reaction to the coupling, \\"I'm definitely prepared for fans to be stunned, especially with Frank being a new character coming into Shorty and Kylie's the it-girl of Shortland Street\\". Despite this hesitation, Patrick was ensured by the show's producer that the relationship would be legitimate and long-running. The pair meet at 'The I.V.' bar, and the resulting relationship was said to be \\"passionate\\", \\"saucy\\" and saw an early skinny dip scene between the two. The skinny dip scene was Patrick's first day filming and despite recalling it as \\"embarrassing\\", he believed it was an easy way to break barriers between himself and Dewing. Despite only dating for several weeks, the character's returned from a short hiatus with the news that they were married. Dewing also questioned fan reaction due to the short length of time following Kylie's relationship breakdown with TK, \\"I think a lot of people will question (the relationship's) longevity at this point. However, it's almost so unrealistic, that it's kind of believable that someone so different would come along and sweep her in a totally different direction and that she would just fall for it 100 per cent.\\" Patrick believed the relationship worked because, \\"Frank has a big heart. He's just been really conflicted most of his life and he's never felt like he belonged anywhere\\" but \\"that's partly what draws Kylie to Frank. She's had all these troublesome relationships and even though there's doubt within himself about whether he's good enough, he knows that he's the right guy for her.\\" Frank departed the show in 2018 leaving Kylie behind with serial killer Dylan Reinhart (Ryan O'Kane). Upon his return in 2019, Kylie had reconciled with ex- partner TK Samuels. Patrick believed that Frank would \\"be happy because she's happy and that's all he's ever wanted, whether that's with him or without him.\\" However Patrick acknowledged that Frank \\"wants to reconcile with Kylie, and maybe sit down and have a chat with her about why he left and how he's grown\\". Reception The addition of Carrie's triplet storyline was praised for showing a \\"softer side\\" to the otherwise \\"stern matron\\". The return of Finn and his siblings was said to \\"delight\\" Shortland Street fans. Actor Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner) named the triplet's returns in 2016 as his favourite storyline, noting the \\"fun\\" the co-stars have on set. He also aspired for the triplet's to remain on the show for a \\"long time to come\\". The chemistry between Galvin and the three triplet actors, was said to be very genuine and the triplets were so believable it appeared as though they were related in real life. Frank's line: \\"Tell me where my sister is or I’ll rip ya head off and spit down ya neck\\" was nominated by The Spinoff columnists as one of the 25th anniversary episode's best quotes. Following Patrick's departure, Galvin called for the actor's return calling the triplet actors \\"fantastic\\" and how he \\"loved working with them.\\" The character of Frank was reportedly very popular with fans following his 2016 return and this was said to increase once Patrick departed the soap. This led to the character being reintroduced in 2019. Frank's return during the 2019 season finale was described as \\"huge\\" by television columnist Kate Robertson, and was said to be \\"just what ... fans have been demanding.\\" References Shortland Street characters Television characters introduced in 1993 Fictional triplets Male characters in television ","title":"Frank Warner (Shortland Street)"},{"id":"55944647","title":"I'd Die to Be with You Tonight"},{"id":"55944658","text":"Aregonis () is a character in Greek mythology.

Since 2003 however there has been a greater push from the government to impose stricter rules. Since 2009 it is illegal to smoke in or around public buildings, although the ban remains unpopular with the Iraqi public and enforcement is inconsistent. A 2015 study conducted by health advocates stated that and average of 55 Iraqis die daily due to tobacco related diseases. By comparison and average of 10 people a day are killed in Iraq due to terrorism and violence. History and prevalence Tobacco consumption has historically been popular in the Arab region since the colonial era, but prevalence has increased significantly in Iraq since the Iran-Iraq War, and subsequent violence. The rates being at 31% for men and 4% for women. Smoking in the Kurdistan region are significantly lower at 15.3% with 25.1% and 2.7% regarding the rates for men and women respectively. Bans and legality Theoretically tobacco advertisement is prohibited and it is illegal to smoke in public places and indoors, enforcement is iratic at best. A 2015 survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that there were multiple billboards throughout the capital Baghdad promoting tobacco, as well as in hospitals and schools. The same survey found that 13% of Iraqi districts had no funded cessation programs aimed at helping smokers quit. Taxation by the government on cigarettes, although increasing, is comparatively low at less than 50%; most packs are sold for less than a US dollar. Public opinion Smoking is seen by a significant segment of Iraq's population as a socially acceptable way to socialize and relax. Most religious leaders however are opposed to smoking and think it is un-Islamic. Smoking under ISIL Smoking is banned in areas under ISIL occupation, with harsh punishment if violated. In areas that have been liberated smoking has come to be seen as a symbol of freedom and as a celebration of destroying ISIL existing where people publicly share cigarettes and smoke shisha in groups as a way of stating that ISIL is gone.

They changed their focus after identifying a gap in the tea shop market, and chose the name 'Tea two' to denote the two co-founders, but written as 'Tea too'. The business has been credited as paving the way for the tea revival, and transforming the tea industry in Australia by educating consumers and championing different flavours and types of tea.  Ownership  = Startup = In 1996, Jan O'Connor and Maryanne Shearer each put in $50,000 to start the company as equal co-founders. In 'T2: the book', Maryanne Shearer noted that her business relationship with O'Connor deteriorated when she returned to work in March 2000 after having her first child. As relations continued to be strained, an acrimonious legal battle ensued forcing O'Connor to leave the business. Bruce Crome, Shearer's partner, purchased O'Connor's share in the business at the end of October 2001. = Investment partnership = In 2007, Maryanne Shearer and partner Bruce Crome sold 50 per cent of T2 to retail investors Jonathan Dan and Phillip Blanco. After disagreements about growth strategies, Shearer and Crome bought 25 per cent back from Blanco, but Dan continued his investment. = Acquisition by Unilever = Multinational company Unilever acquired T2 from Maryanne Shearer and Bruce Crome in October 2013. As of 2015, Shearer was T2's Creative Director. In announcing the acquisition, Shearer highlighted Unilever's leading role in adopting sustainable agriculture practices for the tea industry as being a good values fit for T2. T2 had worked with Fairtrade since 2009 on the English breakfast tea blend. The Sydney Morning Herald noted that restaurant owner Michael Ryan reacted to the acquisition news with a tweet describing the company as \\"Unilever's Teas'r'Us\\". In 2017, writer Jayne D'Arcy used the term \\"Unilever- ed\\", to describe the company's shift from being locally Melbourne-owned. The purchase price was estimated to be less than $100 million, and was later disclosed as $60 million. Legal services for T2 were provided by Baker & McKenzie and Harris Carlson, with financial advice from Deloitte. Legal services for Unilever were provided by Johnson Winter & Slattery, with financial advice from KPMG.  Outlets and turnover  = Stores = On 1 July 1996, the first store was opened at 340 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy. A second store was opened on Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, but it was closed after 12 months due to low patronage. However, the following year sales increased 20% which fuelled a vision to expand into Sydney. In November 1999, a store was opened in Chadstone Shopping Centre, Australia's premier shopping centre. The store was immediately a success, helping to increase T2's revenue beyond $1 million. In 2002, T2 expanded to Sydney with a store in King Street, Newtown. In 2004, there were six stores in the chain, and by 2005 there were eight stores, fifty-five team members and a turnover of $4.4 million. In 2006 the turnover was $8 million. In 2008, they moved their operations from Fitzroy to a leased office in the Port Melbourne area. In August 2012, they leased a warehouse at 50 Cyanamid Street in Laverton North. In September 2012, T2 leased a building at 35 Wellington Street in Collingwood, with the intention of relocating the head office to that location. In March 2012, Shearer declared that T2 were \\"being brave\\" in the difficult retail climate by continuing to expand their number of stores. In September 2012, the first Tasmanian T2 store was opened in the Cat & Fiddle Arcade, Hobart. In May 2013, a T2 shop was opened at 269 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, after it was vacated by designer Bettina Liano due to rental costs. That same year, T2 opened a store in Cairns Central. In 2014, 18 new stores were opened. Three of the stores opened in London (including on Shoreditch High Street) and one in New York City. A year later, a fourth London store was opened at 290 Regent Street, in the West End. In 2015, there were over seventy stores in four countries, and around 1,000 team members. In 2017, the first T2 stores were opened in Scotland (131 Buchanan Street, Glasgow), and in Singapore (the first outlet in Asia). As of November 2017, there are over 96 stores across Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Asia. = Wholesale = Towards the end of 1996, O'Connor developed a custom tea blend for Geoff Lindsay's restaurant Stella. The T2 'Stella' blend was mentioned on the menu, which created a lot of interest from diners. After realising there was a huge opportunity supplying tea to restaurants, an untapped market, O'Connor created a wholesale division for T2. From mid-2000 T2 was supplying 300 cafes and restaurants in multiple states of Australia. By September that year the number had increased to 400 with a few international accounts. By mid 2001 the number of wholesale accounts had grown to approximately 500. In 2015 there were 3000 wholesale accounts.  Branding  The store design is focused on enjoyment in the rituals of tea-making, and has been described as \\"...a modern version of an old wares store-cum-apothecary...\\". The first store had a pink-painted ceiling and Chinese newspapers as wallpaper. The stores' interior design is dark and moody, with orange and black as signature colours. T2's signature orange has been analysed as having vibrancy to appeal to a younger market while retaining simplicity for older tastes, and to imply the colour of brewing tea without being murky or brown. The sensory experience includes tea tastings and \\"smelling table\\" product displays of the tea ingredients. The design of the first T2 store in Scotland offered a tea \\"fountain\\" constructed from teaware. The ambience of the T2 stores inspired Sunshine Coast author Josephine Moon's debut 2014 novel The Tea Chest.  Tea blends  A small collection of teas from T2 T2's wide range of blends has been considered reflective of Australians' growing interest in boutique teas. The number of blends or varieties have been variously reported as \\"at least 250\\" in 2003, \\"over 200\\" in 2005, \\"about 180\\" in 2006, \\"250-plus\\" in 2015, and in 2017, one of their UK stores had over 130 types of tea. Chai teas became popular in 2006, and continued to be one of the three top-selling teas for T2 in 2010. Until 2007, all T2 teas were sold as loose leaf, but at the demand of restaurants, they then introduced tea bags made of sheer muslin cloth in a pyramid shape. The tea bags were produced with a purpose-built imported machine. In March 2009, in response to the growing popularity of Chinese classic teas, the Perth T2 store launched black tea pu-er in cake form, where previously it had only been selling it as a loose leaf variety. T2 has a special black tea blend with vanilla for their Melbourne home-city, Melbourne Breakfast Tea, as well as other cities: Brisbane Breakfast with mango, Sydney Breakfast, and Perth Breakfast. In May 2013, T2 created Hobart Breakfast tea. The Melbourne Breakfast Tea and Liquorice Legs were initially the best-selling blends in the Shoreditch London store in 2014, with later top sellers being London Breakfast and Earl Grey Royale. Flush Darjeeling was so popular as to merit a waiting list. In 2016 they introduced the Veggie Patch limited edition loose tea range based on vegetables including Carrot, Ginger & Turmeric; Green Tea & Spinach; Apple, Kale & Ginger; and Rooibos, Beetroot & Broccoli. A limited edition collection of chai teas was released in 2017, with blends tasting of popcorn, sticky honey, or honeycomb chai. In line with the first store opening in Singapore, in 2017 T2 created Singapore Breakfast tea, evoking kaya toast with a blend of pu'er, green tea, coconut flakes and roasted rice. That same year the Scots Breakfast tea was created, being a blend of a robust black tea base, oats, cocoa husks, vanilla, cinnamon and sweet caramel notes.  Controversies  = Accidents at storefronts = In December 2013, a Ford Falcon sedan crashed through the front window of the Hobart store, but the driver did not sustain serious injuries. In February 2017, two men fighting each other fell through the window of the Cheltenham store, and were both injured by the broken glass.  Awards  Co-founder Maryanne Shearer received the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year award in 2012. The Shoreditch, London store was designed by Australian-based Landini Associates. It won the Store of the Year in the Retail Design Institute's 2014 International Design Competition. Landini Associates also redesigned T2's corporate headquarters in Collingwood, which was a Silver Winner in the Interior Design - Corporate Category in the 2014 Melbourne Design Awards. In 2015, Christopher Stanko's T2 Tea Cotton Teabags designs ranked as a finalist in the Australian Packaging Design Awards (Beverage category). In December 2016, Metsä Board's packaging design for T2's mini fruit tea range won a Merit Award at the 28th Hong Kong Print Awards (Paper Packaging category). The design also won the Limited Edition category in The Dieline Awards 2017. In the same year, they won an IF Design Award (Beverages Packaging category).  Book  In 2015, Shearer published T2: the book, which discussed the company's history, profiled different types of tea and recommended tea cups and brewing techniques. In February 2016, Kristen Droesch's book review in Library Journal highlighted the unique, artistic details of the design, and considered it to be \\"...more than just an advertisement for T2.\\". The book was designed by Evi O and was a category winner for the Australian Book Designers Association's Best Designed Fully-illustrated Book under $50 in 2016.

Aphrodite Areia (Ancient Greek: Ἀφροδίτη Ἀρεία) or \\"Aphrodite the Warlike\\" was a cult epithet of the Greek goddess Aphrodite, in which she was depicted in full armor like the war god Ares. This representation was found in Sparta and Taras (modern Taranto). There were other, similarly martial interpretations of the goddess, such as at her Sanctuary at Kythira, where she was worshiped under the epithet Aphrodite Urania, who was also represented as being armed. The epithet \\"Areia\\", meaning \\"warlike\\", was applied to other gods in addition to Aphrodite, such as Athena, Zeus, and possibly Hermes. The association with warfare contradicts Aphrodite's more popularly known role as the goddess of desire, fertility, and beauty. In the Iliad, Aphrodite is portrayed as incompetent in battle, being wounded in the wrist by Diomedes under the guidance of Athena, and she is reminded of her role as a love goddess rather than a war goddess like Athena by Zeus.Homer, Iliad, 345 It is possible, however, that this representation was deliberate to assert the Ionian interpretation of Aphrodite, which did not portray the goddess with warlike aspects, as the \\"correct\\" version.  Origins  It is believed that the warlike depiction of Aphrodite belongs to her very earliest acolytes and cults in Cyprus and Cythera, where there was a strong eastern influence during the Orientalizing Period. This depiction can trace Aphrodite's descent from older Middle Eastern goddesses such as the Sumerian Inanna, Mesopotamian Ishtar, and Phoenician Astarte. In Cyprus, Aphrodite was also referred to by the epithet \\"Aphrodite Encheios\\" (Aphrodite with a spear), and it has been suggested that the cult was brought from Cyprus to Sparta. She was also known by this name on the Areopagus and at Corinth.  Cult in Greece  There were cults dedicated to the warlike aspect of Aphrodite in Kythira, Cyprus, Argos, Taras and most prominently in Sparta.[1] Pausanias recorded that three cult statues at Kythira, Sparta, and Corinth depicted Aphrodite as holding weapons and archeological evidence points to this portrayal also occurring in Argos. Pausanias' claim that \\"Aphrodite Areia\\" was simply a female version of Ares has some support in the contemporary epigraphy.[1]Widdowson, Alexandra. (2010). The Many Faces of 'Golden Aphrodite' - An exploration of Aphrodite’s multidimensionality. University of Reading. pp, 4-42 In Sparta, Pausanias described two temples dedicated to Aphrodite Areia and archeological evidence supports this claim.[1] Various authors make reference to Sparta worshipping an armoured Aphrodite, such as Plutarch, Nonnos, and Quintilian. Pausanias' claim that \\"Aphrodite Areia\\" was simply a female version of Ares has some support in the contemporary epigraphy. A related Spartan epithet, \\"Armed Aphrodite\\" (Ἀφροδίτη 'Ενόπλιος) was associated with an etiological myth recorded by Lactanius, who stated that once the Spartan army was away from the city attacking Messene., part of the Messene army launched a counterattack against Sparta that was thwarted by the Spartan women who armed themselves and defended the city. The Spartan army, realizing their city was under siege, returned and assumed that the women were the enemy army until they stripped off their armour to reveal their identities. It is likely that this myth was used to explain the origin of an unknown Spartan festival that functioned similarly to the Argive festival of Hybristica, where women took over the roles of men. In Argos, Aphrodite Areia appears to be related to Nikephoros (\\"victory bearer\\") and in a nearby city of Manteneia, there was a temple devoted to both Aphrodite and Ares.

Together with Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan, he led the reformation activities in the Malankara Church after the passing away of Abraham Malpan including the establishment of prayer meetings, vernacular worship and Holy Communion in Malayalam as well as the publication of translated and revised Syriac Liturgy in Malayalam, all of which led to the eventual formation of the Mar Thoma Church. He also played an important role during the first three decades of the church's independent existence as its first Vicar General, after it separated from the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church following the Travancore Royal Court verdict in 1889. Life and Education  Iype Thoma Kathanar was born on 2 December 1842 (17 Vrichikam 1017, M.E.) as Iype Thommy into the aristocratic Kovoor family of Syrian Christians at Thiruvalla, Travancore state. He was born to his father Kovoor Thommy Iype who was a timber merchant and his mother Mariamma who was the daughter of Ittycheria Punoose of the Pulimoottil family in Thiruvalla. He had one sister (Mariamma) and four brothers (Behannan, Punoose, Eliyas, and Cherian). As a child, he was popularly known as Thommy. As was the norm during those days, he received primary education from the local Kudippallikoodam under the guidance of Thiruvalla Palliyil Ashan. Later on, he studied basic English, Mathematics and Bible study (Christian) at the Church Missionary School at Thukalassery (Thiruvalla). The school recommended him higher education at England, but this proposal was rejected by his parents. Later on, he studied Syriac language, liturgy and chants from his relative and Syriac scholar, Kovoor Gheevarhese Kathanar. He became highly proficient in Syriac liturgy at the age of 16 and used to sing and chant liturgical prayers and hymns in Syriac at Niranam church, and he could impress Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan during one of his visits to Niranam. Ordination In 1858, Iype Thommy received holy ordination as a deacon, from Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan at Kottayam Old Seminary. In 1859, he married Elizhuba who belonged to the Kallooppara Marettu family. In 1861, Iype Thomy received holy ordination as a priest, from Euyakim Mar Coorilos the Patriarchal delegate Metropolitan sent from Antioch, at his home parish, the Thiruvalla Paliyakara St. George Church. Thus, he started his pastoral ministry and became known as Kovoor Achen. Reformation in Malankara Church Inspired by the ministry and reformatory teachings of early reformers such as Abraham Malpan and Kaithayil Geevarghese Malpan, Kovoor Achen introduced some bold reformatory steps at the Paliyakara Church. This included the use of Malayalam language for Holy Communion instead of Syriac alone that was not understood by the congregation. However, this was not acceptable to the congregation (including his father and family members) who, except for a handful of visionary people, largely opposed Achen's actions and lodged a complaint to the Metropolitan in 1869. However, the Metropolitan did not take any disciplinary action and offered a solution that a wall be built at the east side of the church so that Achen can conduct the qurbana there. Nevertheless, Kovoor Achen continued to use the main altar of the church and went on with his reformatory steps. This led to larger protests, assaults and fictitious allegations to government and eventually the opposing faction constructing a new church at Kavumbhagam (on a land provided by Kattapuram family), namely the Kattapuram St. George Church and later one more new church nearby that was called St. Mulk Church, Kavumbhagam. In spite of opposition, Kovoor Achen carried on with reformation activities. He introduced prayer groups and prayer meetings in Malayalam, wherein lay people were allowed to pray and organize prayer meetings to ensure day to day spiritual upbringing of the church members. He also oversaw the construction of the wooden bridge in front of the Paliyakara church. Under his supervision, a formal accounting system with book keeping was established to manage the church finances in a proper manner. The liturgical reformation undertaken by him led to the first formal Malayalam translation of the Thaksa i.e. the West Syriac Jacobite version of St. James Liturgy, with necessary corrections, deletions and revisions made as per the basic principles of reformation in Malankara that were established a few decades ago by Abraham Malpan. In 1872, after getting approval from Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan, this revised Liturgy was formally published in Malayalam and printed at CMS Press, Kottayam. This revised translated Liturgy was followed in eight churches including Maramon Church. The reformatory activities eventually led to the Royal Travancore Court Verdict of 1889 and eventual formation of the Mar Thoma Church as an independent church, but without access to any of the old churches except for 3 of them. Leadership in the Mar Thoma Church In 1892, Kovoor Achen was designed as the Vicar General of the Mar Thoma Church. In the same year, he realized the purchase of Panchayathu Purayidam (present day S.C.S. Thiruvalla campus on S.C.S. Mount) to establish a permanent central campus for the Church. This Panchathu property was purchased from Thittapallil, a rich Ezhava family of Thiruvalla, for a sum of Rs.600. This sum was raised from a generous endowment made from Puthencavu Mathilakam Arohanam Mar Thoma Church out of the Rs. 1000 that they had received as severance pay in lieu of relinquishing their claims upon separating from their pre-reformation home parish St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Puthencavu in 1900. Kovoor Achen is also credited with the practice of Kettuthengu (Malayalam: കെട്ടുതെങ്ങ്), wherein coconut trees from each home is dedicated to generate funds that help meet the expenses of the Church activities, since coconuts and coconut tree products were a main source of income for most families during those times. He also oversaw the consecration of several priests and bishops who led the church during the 19th and 20th Century. A notable example being Abraham Mar Thoma who was sent to USA as a Deacon in 1912 for his doctoral studies until 1915 on Kovoor Achen's initiative. This was before Abraham Mar Thoma was consecrated as a priest and later as Bishop on 28 December 1917 (although Kovoor Achen could not witness the consecration as Bishop, as he passed away during January 1917). When Ipe Thoma Kathanaar became the Vicar General, his nephew K.P. Thomas was consecrated as a priest by Titus I Metropolitan in 1895 at Paliekkara Church. Rev. K. P. Thomas taught at Kottayam Mar Thoma Seminary and also acted as Assistant Vicar to Ipe Thoma Kathanar and served at various parishes such as Thiruvalla, Mepral, Chatthenkery and Karackal. In secular life Ipe Thoma Kathanar was well known as an orator and debater. One of his famous debates at Niranam was documented. As a representative of the people of Thiruvalla taluk, he was elected to the Travancore Sri Mulam Praja Sabha, the first popularly elected legislature in modern India, during the years 1904, 1905, 1911, 1914 and 1915. Death On 16 January 1917, Kovoor Achen became sick and he died peacefully on 27 January 1917. Achen’s body was buried in the SCS compound behind the SCS Church. Legacy In his memory, the church constructed the VGM Hall (Vicar General Iype Thoma Kathanar Memorial Hall) in the SCS compound in Tiruvalla, that still stands today as an important go-to place in Thiruvalla town for conducting large meetings, conferences and major events. His son Abraham Thomas Kovoor (1898 – 1978) was a professor and rationalist who became famous through his campaign to expose various Indian and Sri Lankan \\"god-men\\" and so-called paranormal phenomena as frauds. His grand son, Aries Kovoor (1927 - 2006), was also a professor and renowned biological scientist of Sri Lanka. His younger son, Kovoor Thomas Behanan was a renowned sociologist and psychologist, who earned Ph.D. in Psychology from Yale in 1934 and had performed pioneering scientific appraisal on Yoga that was published as a book and made popular to the western world through visual coverage in the LIFE magazine in 1937.

Dali (also Daal or Dæl; ) is a goddess from the mythology of the Georgian people of the Caucasus region. She is a hunting goddess who serves as the patron of hoofed wild mountain animals such as ibex and deer. Hunters who obeyed her numerous taboos would be assured of success in the hunt; conversely, she would harshly punish any who violated them. She is most prominently attested in the stories of the Svan ethnic subgroup in northwestern Georgia. Other groups in western Georgia had similar figures considered equivalent to Dali, such as the Mingrelian goddess Tkashi-Mapa (). She was usually described as a beautiful nude woman with golden hair and glowing skin, although she sometimes took on the form of her favored animals, usually with some marking to differentiate her from the herd. She was said to reside in a cavern high in the mountains, where she kept watch over the hoofed game animals who live on the cliffs. Dali was styled with a variety of regional epithets reflecting her different roles and associations. Stories of the Svan people depict her taking human lovers and killing them out of jealousy, giving birth to sons such as the culture hero Amirani, and later clashing with her rival Saint George. Some myths depict her working alongside other forest deities, and she is sometimes accompanied by the legendary hunting dog Q'ursha. After the rise of Christianity in Georgia, Dali's importance as a goddess waned, which was reflected in changes to stories told about her. St. George was presented as having the power to overrule her, and she began to be conflated with a malicious nature spirit called the ali. Many authors have described parallels between Dali and stories from other mythologies. As a patron of the hunt associated with hoofed beasts, she has been compared with Artemis of Greek mythology, a Scottish hag called the glaistig, and the maiden who tames the unicorn. Her associations with gold, seduction, and the morning star have led scholars to draw connections with goddesses such as Aphrodite and Ishtar, who have similar mythological themes. Her story remains an important part of Georgian cultural consciousness, and she is often referenced with eponyms and literary allusions. Though younger people treat her as a figure from mythology, some older hunters still consider her to be a real figure that one might encounter deep in the forest.  Origins  right Dali is attested primarily in surviving pieces of Svan folklore: myths, ballads, and round-dance songs. Linguistic anthropologist Kevin Tuite regards the surviving texts as fragmentary, representing \\"but a tiny fraction of the texts that would have been in circulation in the Svaneti of a few centuries ago\\". He also noted that most of these pieces would have been performed and likely composed by men, leaving any female perspective of Dali unclear. Dali is also attested in oral traditions recorded in modern academic fieldwork by Georgian academics such as Vera Bardavelidze in the 1930s and Elene Virsaladze in the 1950s–1970s. According to Virsaladze, Georgian culture exhibits an extraordinary degree of live retention of ancient folklore and traditions, possibly from as far back as 3,300 years ago. It has been suggested that Dali, along with numerous other deities of Georgian mythology, had her origins in a lost common religion of the Kartvelian peoples. Variations on this idea were supported by the Georgian historians Nikolai Marr and Ivane Javakhishvili, both of whom independently theorized that the similarities in folklore between the various Georgian ethnic groups indicated a common religious origin. Dating the origin of this religion, and therefore of Dali in particular, may be impossible due to the lack of surviving written sources. The only thing that can be stated definitively is that these beliefs predate the adoption of Christianity in Georgia, which archaeological evidence indicates began as early as the 3rd century. Some archaeological artifacts have been suggested to have a connection to Dali. Folklorist Mikheil Chikovani considered the Trialeti Chalice, a Georgian artifact from approximately the 2nd millennium BCE, to depict a round dance or ritual dedicated to a goddess of the hunt comparable to Dali. He connected the motif of the animals on the lower portion of the chalice to the hoofed animals which Dali protected. Folklorist David Hunt also suggested the Chalice could be a depiction of a mistress of beasts. Some historians have speculated that certain Phasian drachma coins from the 4th to 5th century may have depicted Dali or her precursors, although numismatist John Hind argued against these interpretations in a 2005 paper. = Etymology and epithets = The etymology of Dali's name is unclear. Although many figures in Georgian mythology have origins in figures from the early Georgian Orthodox Church, Dali is not among them. It has been suggested that the name comes from the Georgian word dila, meaning \\"morning\\", or the Ossetian word dælimon meaning \\"demon\\", but these links are disputed. Tuite has linked the name to the various words for \\"god\\" in the Nakh languages, a group of languages in the Northeast Caucasian language family: \\"Chechen dēla, Ingush dǣlə, Bats dalě.\\" These words can refer to Allah specifically, or can be used as a general term for pre-Islamic deities in the region. It was characteristic for central Caucasian cultures to replace sacred words with substitutes; this lexical replacement was driven by taboos against speaking the true words. Tuite believed that Dali might originally have had a Svan name that gradually became replaced by the Nakh term for \\"god\\" as a result of this process. Dali and her equivalents were also known by various epithets, reflecting local perceptions of the goddess's role or associations. At times she was simply called \\"Radiant\\", in reference to her extraordinary beauty. When focusing on her association with New Year's Eve, she was referred to with the epithet of Dæl Ešxwmiš, or \\"Dali of New Year's Eve\\". The Svan called her \\"the Queen Dali\\". Because she was said to live high in the mountains, she was sometimes referred to as \\"Dali of the Rocks\\". In the Racha and Kakheti regions she was called \\"the Mistress of Beasts\\" and the \\"Angel of the Crags\\". The name Tkashi-Mapa, used by the Mingrelians, translates as \\"the Queen of the Woods\\" or \\"the Sovereign of the Forest\\".  Depiction  alt=Double-peaked snowy mountain in daylight against cloudless blue sky Traditionally, Dali lived in a cavern high up in the mountains, far away from human settlements. Some traditions specified her home was the distinctive double-peaked mountain Ushba, whose ice-covered south face was sometimes called Dalis panjara, the Window of Dali (). The cave's exact location varied; it could be on the side of a glacier, or at the summit of the mountain. Sometimes the entrance was concealed by a rock door which Dali opened and closed to hide her dwelling. Rarely, Dali and her flock lived inside an enormous hollowed-out spruce tree. As a rule, Dali did not enter civilized spaces such as villages except on rare occasions, such as the funerals of her human lovers. Dali was usually described as a beautiful young woman with long braided hair. She was most often portrayed as nude, occasionally wearing gold jewellery. If she wore clothes, they were white. Her skin was so white it was literally radiant. Her beauty was extraordinary: \\"both irresistible and terrible,\\" it could drive a man to madness if he even spoke to her. Dali's long hair was an important component of her mythology. Her hair was gold-colored; in some cases, it was actually made of gold, and shone like the sun. Some stories depicted this gleaming aspect as fire, describing the goddess leaving \\"little tongues of flame\\" in her wake, although this is less prevalent. She would sit on the cliffs combing her hair with a golden comb. In some tales, Dali used her supernaturally-strong hair to bind hunters who wronged her. In one story, she used it to strangle a hunter who had stolen one of her hairs to string his hunting bow. Although strong enough to string a bow with, her hair was not invulnerable; indeed, using Dali's hair to threaten, harm, or kill her was a recurring motif. Multiple tales depict hunters grabbing or cutting Dali's hair in order to subdue and rape her. This tactic did not necessarily prevent the goddess from later taking revenge for these wrongs. In a story about Dali's Mingrelian equivalent Tkashi-Mapa, the goddess agrees to marry a hunter when he threatens to cut off her luxurious hair. He eventually grows tired of her endlessly washing and combing it, and hides her prized comb so she will stop. She destroys his family, killing one of his children and stealing another, and curses his entire line of descendants in revenge. Women could also use Dali's hair against her. In one of the major Dali stories, a woman discovers her husband sleeping with Dali. She cuts Dali's hair off in a rage, killing her or banishing her from the world. A superstition recorded in 1971 described how a woman whose man had been away hunting too long might cut her own hair off, praying that God would cut Dali's hair in return, which would force the goddess to allow her husband to return home. In one unusual variation of the hair-cutting motif, a woman wishing to rid her son or her husband of Dali's influence sneaks up on the goddess while she is sleeping and washes her hair, sometimes in deer's milk. Dali is rendered so powerless, or so grateful, by this act that she becomes the woman's servant. Her Mingrelian equivalent could be dismissed with a similar method, using milk from a black cow instead of a deer.  Primary motifs  alt=White deer with foliage in background = Game animals and hunting = Dali's primary mythological role was that of the mistress and guardian of hoofed game animals of the mountain. She protected her charges, which included deer, ibex, wild sheep, and goat-antelopes like turs and chamois, just as a shepherd guards a flock. Some stories portray her milking her animals. She was responsible for granting favor or misfortune to hunters, punishing the greedy and ensuring there would always be enough game to go around. Stories involving Dali often feature animals that have been marked in ways that identify them as special: either they are Dali's favorites among the herd, or they are the goddess herself in the form of an animal. Examples of these special features include a purely white coat, unusual markings, or golden horns. Dali could vary her size in both her animal and human forms. When she took the shape of her favored animals, they were often significantly larger or smaller than the usual animals of that kind. She could also make her human form very small: in eastern Georgia, hunters would leave tiny pairs of shoes on the cliffs as an offering to her. Several tales recorded by Georgian folklorist Elene Virsaladze reflect the deadly consequences for a hunter who wounded or killed one of Dali's marked beasts, or hunted too greedily. Two stories describe Dali cursing a hunter's family such that his sons, and later the hunter himself, died as a result. Another story describes Dali destroying the town of Nakvderi with an avalanche as revenge after a hunter wounded a tur marked by the goddess. In another story, a hunter killed a doe and its fawn, and was cursed by the herd's protector to never have any descendants of his own. One Svan story describes the consequences for three brothers who follow one of Dali's mountain goats up into the crags and attempt to shoot it. The first two brothers both miss the goat, and are attacked and killed by Dali, who has been hiding in her cave nearby watching. The third brother watches the goat vanish into Dali's cave, and hides. Dali eventually emerges. The hunter leaps out of hiding, grabs her by the hair, and rapes her. She then becomes his mistress. The story's unusual inclusion of a hunter who overpowers Dali may indicate that it took some influence from an Ossetian legend involving two brothers overcoming a deer-herding witch. = Appeasement through taboos and offerings = Horns of the alt=Large pair of curved horns mounted on wood Despite her protectiveness towards her animals, Dali was not necessarily hostile to hunters, and would even grant them blessings if they respected certain taboos and made appropriate offerings to her. These taboos typically revolved around concerns about spiritual purity and prevention of overhunting. Offerings usually involved small personal sacrifices given before and after the hunt. Dali was perceived as extremely sensitive to any kind of spiritual pollution entering her mountains, which were considered pure and therefore sacred. She demanded that hunters abstain from the hunt if they were impure in any of a number of ways. Impurity usually originated from women and blood, but could also come from use of foul language, commission of adulterous acts, and association with dead bodies. On the night before a hunt, hunters had to refrain from intercourse with any women, even their wives. They had to avoid any contact, sexual or otherwise, with any woman who was in childbirth or menstruating, as menstrual blood was seen to be impure (a form of menstrual taboo). The wives of hunters were also subject to behavioral taboos. In some regions, \\"the wives of huntsmen were traditionally forbidden to wash, comb, or unplait their hair\\" while their husbands were out on the hunt. In an extension of the hunter's menstrual taboo, women were not permitted to eat meat from the hunt while menstruating, pregnant, or in childbirth. Hunting was treated as a sacred act among the Svan. The hunt began with a sacrifice of a ceremonial bread, called lamsir, which was offered to Dali with a prayer. Hunters were taught not to kill more beasts than they could carry, usually one for each man in the hunting party. If their efforts were successful, hunters would make an offering of organ meat to Dali in thanksgiving. In some traditions, the horns of the animal would be consecrated to Dali once the hunters returned to their village. It was believed that hunters who respected these taboos and made correct offerings, thereby avoiding ritual impurity, would always find enough game to ensure that they and their families were fed. Conversely, hunters who became impure by failing to abide by taboos and restrictions could be punished by Dali in a number of ways ranging from failure to find game all the way to death by fatal fall, depending on the severity of the violation. It was sometimes possible to abate Dali's rage after a transgression with appropriate offerings, as in one story where an offering of sacred bread prevented Dali from destroying a village by flooding the Inguri River. = Seduction and jealousy = alt=Seated man in traditional garb smoking pipe Stories involving Dali often depict her taking mortal hunters as lovers, bringing both blessings and peril to the hunter in question. In an inversion of traditional gender roles, it is the goddess who chooses the hunter and initiates the affair. Often, her target was a hunter who had done her a favor such as protecting her from a pursuer. She would give her lovers tokens of affection such as beads, jewellery, or small objects like scissors, which he was required to keep hidden from everyone. A hunter who became Dali's lover would be guaranteed success in the hunt. The goddess might even protect the hunter from human assailants and heal his wounds. In return, he was prohibited from revealing the secret of his good fortune, and from taking any mortal lovers for the duration of the affair. Engaging in an affair with Dali was a dangerous undertaking. Dali's beauty would inflame the hunter's passions to the point of near-madness, a state that was referred to as being \\"dalelukdune, Dali- possessed\\" (). Afflicted hunters would wander the wilderness aimlessly waiting for the goddess to find them. After the affair was consummated, any appearance of infidelity on the hunter's part could incur the goddess's fatal wrath. He could be attacked by her animals or lured to his death upon a dangerous cliff. Dali's Mingrelian equivalent was known to petrify hunters who offended her. Even if a hunter did survive the liaison, he might be unable to take a mortal lover for the remainder of his life for fear of angering the goddess. It was possible for a wily hunter to negotiate terms with Dali, such as limiting the length of the affair, or securing the right to marry a mortal at a later time. As long as the hunter's terms were set before the affair began, Dali would respect them. Some traditions held that a hunter could safely end an affair with Dali by giving his undergarments to a male guest, who would become the new focus of Dali's affections, allowing the original hunter to marry without enraging the goddess. Even death did not end Dali's obsessive behavior toward her beloved hunters. She would come down from the mountains into villages to grieve dramatically over the bodies of hunters, even those whose deaths she was responsible for in the first place. Some villages had family members stand guard over freshly buried bodies to prevent Dali from unearthing them to weep over. In others, the family would leave the hunter's body alone in the house, enabling Dali to dress the body and mourn over it for a short time. Although not specifically regarded as a fertility goddess, two major myths depict Dali giving birth. In one, the goddess drops her infant after the birth. It is rescued by a hunter, to whom she offers a sexual liaison as a reward. In the second, Dali seduces a hunter, becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a demigod son who becomes a hero. = Times of transition = The planet alt=Planet Venus bright against night sky Although she is primarily a hunting deity, Dali has strong associations with symbols and states of transition, such as dawn, the morning star, and New Year's Eve. Svan hunting lore placed significant emphasis on the morning star. Svan hunters were taught to leave their homes before dawn, and arrive at the hunting grounds by its light. Once at the hunting grounds, they would light a small fire and offer a prayer via the morning star to Dali and other hunting deities such as Apsat (the god of small game) or St. George (the patron of hunters). In the story of the hunter Betkil, his death at Dali's hands is sometimes set at the moment that the morning star appears in the sky, or the moment the night becomes dawn. Dali was also celebrated on New Year's Eve as the bringer of a peaceful transition from the old year to the new. During these celebrations, she was referred to with the epithet of Dæl Ešxwmiš, or \\"Dali of New Year's Eve\\". Both male and female heads of household would make offerings of special bread baked from consecrated grain to Dali of New Year's Eve. Georgian ethnologist Vera Bardavelidze documented a number of different forms of this sacred bread from various villages based on fieldwork she conducted in the 1930s. Some loaves would be kept until spring, where they would be crumbled and sown into the earth at a planting festival.  Mythology  = Affair with Betkil = The most well-known of Dali's affairs is her dalliance with the legendary hunter Betkil or Betgil, who falls to his death from a high cliff after betraying Dali's affections. The story is depicted in the traditional Svan circle dance songs Bail Betkil, Betkan Kutsa and Betkani. These dances were performed in the Racha region of western Georgia each year on the third Sunday following Easter, at the bottom of the cliff where Betkil is believed to have died. The exact location is uncertain: Tuite mentions the Free Svaneti communes of Mulakhi and Muzhali, while folklorist Anna Chaudhri pinpoints the village of Ghebi. The annual performance of these dances was linked to a ritual meant to summon the rain. The story begins with Dali selecting and pursuing Betkil. She gives him a token of her favor (Tuite translates it as \\"a bead, ring, or charm\\") and demands that he abstain from the touch of mortal females, including his own wife. For a time he is faithful to her, and as a result his hunts are always fruitful. Eventually, he breaks his vow with a mortal woman—most often his wife, but occasionally his sister-in-law—and this woman steals the goddess's love-token. In a rage, Dali transforms herself into a white deer or chamois and lures an unsuspecting Betkil from his village to the top of her mountain. The path closes, crumbles, or melts away behind him, forcing him to continue forward until he reaches the peak. There, Dali returns to her human form and angrily confronts Betkil about his betrayal and the loss of her token. The ground beneath Betkil's feet crumbles away entirely and leaves him hanging by one hand and one foot. Dali disappears, leaving Betkil to either jump or fall to his death. In some versions, prior to his death, Betkil entreats his family to grieve for him in various ways, and laments that his mortal lover allowed him to go out hunting while \\"impure\\". In some variations of the Betkil story, he is accompanied up the mountain by the supernatural dog Q'ursha. In this version, Betkil is trapped on the mountain for several days and runs out of food. Eventually, Q'ursha insists that Betkil kill and eat him to survive. In some versions he goes through with it. In others, he kills the hound but cannot bring himself to eat him. Finally, in other versions, he sends Q'ursha to his village for help instead. The villagers come to Betkil's aid and throw ropes to him, but Dali's mountain grows taller and taller and the ropes cannot reach him. Again, he falls to his death. = White Mangur = Another hunter, known as White Mangur, fares unusually well in his encounter with Dali. One version of the story, recorded by academic researchers and first published in 1939, describes Mangur as a famously prosperous hunter. One night, he takes shelter in an empty cave. Dali arrives and demands that he explain his presence in her cave. Mangur explains that he was overtaken by nightfall and had no other shelter available. Dali remarks that if he were any other man, she would \\"arrange for you an unlucky return home,\\" but says it would be a pity to harm a man like Mangur. Instead, she invites him to her bed. He protests briefly that he has a wife and child, but quickly relents, and they have an affair. She tells him she will give him plenty of game, and if he is ever in trouble, to call her name. In the morning, White Mangur leaves Dali's cave, but is soon accosted by enemies. He kills nine of his enemies, but receives nine serious wounds in return. He calls out to Dali for help, and the goddess leaps from behind the crags and massacres Mangur's enemies with an ash branch. She heals his wounds at a touch and sends him home. = \\"Dali is Giving Birth on the Crags\\" = The story of Dali giving birth on the crags has been passed down as a song accompanied by a traditional circle dance, called Dælil k'ojas khelghwazhale in Svan (). Linguistic analysis corroborated by archaeological findings indicates that the song is of ancient origin. The song begins with a hunter named Mepsay or Mepisa, who hears the goddess crying out in pain from childbirth. Immediately after giving birth, Dali drops the infant down the mountain, where it is snatched up by a waiting wolf. The hunter shoots the wolf and brings the infant back up the mountain to Dali. She offers the hunter a choice of reward: she will gift him with various game animals, or he can become her lover. He warily declines her offer of sexual favors and asks for success in the hunt. Later, he attempts to shoot an ibex with golden horns, not realizing that it is the goddess herself. His bullet ricochets off the ibex's horns and strikes him down, killing him. In this story, the name of the child's father and the fate of the child are never given. = Amirani = Amirani as depicted on a USSR postage stamp from 1989 The second of Dali's childbirth stories has more variations, but generally describes the conception and birth of the culture hero Amirani. In the most prominent version, a hunter finds Dali in the mountains, and she takes him as her lover. After several days together, they are discovered by his angry wife, who cuts off Dali's golden hair or ties her up with it. As a result, Dali is forced to abruptly leave the world (in some variations, the cutting of her hair kills her outright). If she is killed, her pregnancy is discovered after her death. If she is simply banished, she announces that she is pregnant before departing. She declares that her child will be a powerful hero, though not as powerful as he would be had he been carried to term. In either case, her lover reluctantly cuts the infant from her womb. In some versions, the infant is premature and must be placed in the stomach of a bull or the womb of a cow (sometimes both) to complete gestation. Eventually, he is left beside a spring, where he is found by either the Christian God or St. George, and is baptized with the name Amirani. In another version of Amirani's birth story, a mortal hunter cuts off Dali's braids while she sleeps and rapes her; she becomes pregnant. Later, an old hunter named Sulkalmakhi hears her wailing high in the cliffs, and climbs up to her. She tells him she is dying, and begs him to cut her infant free so he does not die with her. She tells Sulkalmakhi to name him Amirani and care for him as his own. Although Amirani is generally depicted as Dali's son, there is a story from the Guria region called \\"Dali and Amirani\\" in which Dali, enraged by an unspecified offense, attempts to entrap an adult Amirani. While wandering the mountains with his dog, Amirani sees a flame and begins to follow it up the cliffs, eventually discovering that the flame is Dali's hair. Dali lures Amirani to the top of the mountain by saying she has been looking for him. His dog warns him of her ill intentions, but Amirani disregards the dog's advice and climbs up to meet her. When he reaches the very top of the mountain, Dali disappears and Amirani finds himself hung from the rocks by her hair. His dog, unable to reach him, convinces a bird to pluck the hair away. Just as the bird frees Amirani, Dali returns and curses the bird and its kind to be weak and useless. This is a variation on the story in which Dali strangles an unnamed hunter at the top of a mountain after he stole a hair to string his bow. = St. George = alt=Round orange badge with six points and horse-mounted man in centre. Later Svan mythology depicts Dali in opposition to St. George. In Georgian mythology, St. George is regarded as a deity whose primary function is the protection of \\"men exploiting the world outside their villages for the benefit of the community,\\" such as shepherds, beekeepers, and most significantly, hunters. The Svan round dance song Monadire Chorla (\\"The Hunter Chorla\\"), a late variation of the Betkil story, depicts a significant clash between Dali and St. George. In the song, a hunter named Chorla kills more than his share of ibexes, despite knowing this will anger the goddess. Dali punishes Chorla for his greed by binding him up on a treacherous cliff. Chorla sends his dog for help, and it returns with St. George, who intervenes for Chorla as a reward for his faith in Jesus Christ. St. George threatens to pollute or destroy the mountains with storms and landslides unless Dali releases Chorla, which she does. Furthermore, he places Chorla under his protection and declares that he can hunt without limit in the future. Some versions of this story, such as the Svan ballads of the hunters Givergil and Kala, describe the hunter being tormented by a group of spirits, collectively referred to as the Dalis, rather than a singular goddess. In the ballad about Kala, the Dalis explicitly call St. George their master when he threatens to destroy their territory. Tuite found this plural representation similar to the \\"St Georges\\" and \\"St Elijahs\\" of Ossetic mythology, which were groups of spirits sharing traits of the Christian saints they were named for. In contrast, Virsaladze found the change from singular goddess to coven of spirits to be a confirmation that Dali had been relegated to a secondary role in Svan hunting mythology. = Associated figures = Dali was not the only hunting deity worshipped by the Svans, and she was sometimes depicted working alongside others. Georges Charachidzé, a French-Georgian scholar of Caucasian culture, recorded that Dali worked with three other Svaneti forest gods to assist the Lord of the Bare Mountain, Ber Shishvlish. These deities were Apsat, the god of small game like fish and birds, Cxek'isk angelwez, the Angel of the Forest, who ruled over forest animals like foxes and bears, and St. George, who was the patron of wolves and hunters. Mikheil Chikovani believed that this multitude of deities represented a later development of the original matriarchal myth, in which Dali was the mistress of all beasts. Particularly, he saw Ber Shishvlish as an unsuccessful replacement for Dali. Some groups in eastern Georgia viewed Apsat and Dali as siblings who each took a season in turn protecting herds of wild beasts. When Apsat was in charge of the animals, hunters were said to have an easy time making kills, but when Dali took over, she watched the animals closely, making it much harder for the hunters to bring them down. The Svaneti circle dance Metkhvar Mare praises both Dali and Apsat in these roles. In some instances, Apsat is represented as Dali's husband or son, or even her father, rather than her sibling. Tuite theorized that this partitioning of roles between the two deities was the result of Apsat being adapted into a pre-existing belief system which featured a female figure as the primary patron of game animals. Another Georgian hunting deity, Ochopintre, is often mentioned alongside Dali. Some sources report that they worked together to herd and protect animals from hunters. In contrast, Virsaladze reports that the Khevsurian people of the Khevsureti region viewed the male Ochopintre as their primary hunting god. They had a figure called the \\"forest woman\\", an unnamed protector of deer, but she was treated as minor in comparison. Some sources refer to Dali being accompanied by hunting dogs, sometimes specifically the legendary black-eared hunting dog Q'ursha. However, Q'ursha is not a consistent feature of Dali stories. He is more commonly depicted accompanying male hunters, including her son, Amirani, as well as the hunter Betkil. = Post-Christianization depiction = As Christianity became more prominent in Georgia, beginning with its arrival in the 3rd century, many pagan beliefs were altered or appropriated to fit Christian ideology. Dali's functions as the mistress of the hunt began to be shifted to St. George, as in the story of the hunter Chorla, where St. George overrules Dali's punishment of the greedy huntsman. Ethnomusicologist Maka Khardziani identified St. George's victory over Dali in the Chorla story as emblematic of the weakening of pagan beliefs in the face of Christian influence. David Hunt suggested that the story in which Dali attempts to strangle Amirani reflects a Christian rejection of the female goddess, who is reduced to a malicious and \\"witch- like\\" figure. Witches' Sabbath, a 19th-century painting by Francisco Goya that depicts Satan in the form of a goatalt=Demonic goat-figure before a frightened crowd Dali's loss of status and power in the Christian era was reflected in altered folk practices. Prayers and sacrifices once offered to Dali were instead offered to St. George. In the village of Tskheta in historic Lechkhumi province, hunters who encountered \\"the forest woman\\" could dismiss her simply by speaking St. George's name, confirming his power over her. Virsaladze writes that as St. George began to eclipse Dali, she became increasingly associated with evil spirits and demonic imagery. Her character became entwined with a kind of evil spirit called the ali. The ali retained Dali's connection with hunters and high crags, but her supernatural beauty, particularly her radiant hair, was inverted into horrifying ugliness. A spell to protect travelers from the ali described her as having misplaced features, backwards limbs, a terrible visage, and \\"ghastly hair, soiled with blood\\". Her malicious aspects were emphasized and her patronage and protection of hunters were downplayed. Dali's favored animals, such as the wild goats and chamois she often transformed into, were used in Christian imagery to depict Satan, an evil entity who opposes God. This degraded version of Dali is sometimes depicted in the company of devils. Virsaladze and Hunt have both suggested these changes to the Dali myth are a direct consequence of the Christian church altering existing pagan beliefs to associate them with evil in an effort to discredit them. According to Virsaladze, this was not entirely successful, and belief in Dali persisted alongside Christianity, particularly in remote mountainous regions where the Christian church had less influence. One elderly man that she interviewed during her research in the mid twentieth- century described Dali as both a deity and as a tormenting spirit, indicating that both versions of the myth were still extant in the modern era.  Mythological parallels  More than one author has discussed significant parallels between Dali and other mythological figures from other cultures with similar roles and associations. Equivalent figures to Dali appear in the mythologies of many Caucasian groups. Scholarly comparisons to various figures from Greek mythology are also prevalent, and some have argued that these similarities are a result of sustained contact between the peoples of ancient Greece and ancient Georgia. Other work has compared Dali to Near Eastern goddesses, as she shares similar motifs including dawn associations and mortal lovers. Finally, it has also been suggested that Dali represents a preserved version of a particular Western European mythological archetype of a mistress of hunting or beasts, which has become altered or corrupted in other places. = Caucasian equivalents = alt=Modern map of Georgia with historical Svaneti region in red. Dali was important to the Svan, to the point of being their most widely-known mythological figure. Other Caucasian peoples had myths that described significantly similar deities who may be considered roughly equivalent with Dali, with regional variations. The Mingrelian people of the historical Samegrelo region, to the south of Svaneti, revered a golden-haired goddess of the hunt called Tkashi-Mapa, who scholars view as an equivalent of Dali due to the overlap in their mythological roles and associations. Both lived in the wilderness, shape-shifted into animals, took mortal lovers, and were dangerously jealous. Tuite, drawing on Chikovani's work in 1972, has proposed that the golden-haired goddess Samdzimari (\\"necklace-wearer\\") from northeastern Georgia served a similar, even equivalent role to Dali, though she was not explicitly a hunting deity. Samdzimari and Dali were both seductive figures associated with domestic functions who moved in inaccessible or non-civilized spaces. Each serves as the female counterpart of their respective regional version of St. George. Caucasian cultures that worshipped a male hunting deity often had stories about a figure who served Dali's function as the \\"mistress of the beasts\\", but was not considered a deity. In many places this figure is known only as the \\"forest woman\\" or a similar descriptive title. Virsaladze regarded this figure as essentially the same as Dali. The Khevsurians, who worshipped the male Ochopintre, retained the concept of a tiny protectress of the cliffs. The Ossetians, whose primary hunting deity was Æfsati, had a forest woman. The northern Caucasian Kumyks and the inhabitants of the Lechkhumi and Guria regions each had a forest woman rather than a strong tradition of a hunting goddess. The Avar people of the northern Caucasus have stories about a \\"Forest Beauty\\" with golden hair like Dali. The recurring concept of a \\"forest woman\\" (or less frequently a \\"forest man\\") has been proposed as possible evidence of a common pan-Caucasian mythology that might have existed before Christianity and Islam came to the Caucasus. The \\"forest woman\\" is a recurring motif in the Nart saga, a loose collection of stories from the northern Caucasus which underpins much of the mythology of the area. The Digor, an Ossetian subgroup, have a story from about a deer-herding witch who bears some similarities to Dali. Like Dali, she favors a white doe and uses her hair to bind hunters who offend her, although unlike most Dali stories, the hunters overcome the witch in the end. Other Nart saga stories involve goddesses or magical women who, like Dali, transform into deer, have glowing skin, and take hunters as lovers. Tuite has also noted that Dzerassae, a water spirit of the Nart saga, had similarities to Dali: she had golden hair and could change her shape into a fish or a deer. He cited linguist John Colarusso, who suggested that there might be a link between their names based on the initial syllable, with the shift in phoneme caused by translation into Circassian. = Greek mythology = Circe (1860), by alt=Marble statue of Circe, nude. Tuite compared Dali in her role as the mother of Amirani to the Greek Nereid Thetis, mother of Achilles. Each goddess took a mortal for a lover and bore a demi-god son. Their sons were destined to be warriors of enormous power, possibly enough to challenge the creator deity of their respective mythologies. Although extremely formidable, neither attains his full potential, and both are eventually defeated. Tuite posits that the similarity between the two myths is indicative of prehistoric contact between the ancient Greek and Caucasian peoples. Classical scholar Egbert Bakker discussed Dali as a parallel to the Greek witch-goddess Circe of Homer's Odyssey, highlighting their shared aspects: \\"protection of animals, sexual predation, dawn and New Year associations,\\" and a \\"male divine counterpart and adversary.\\" He went on to suggest that their similarities indicated a cultural exchange between the Georgians and the Greeks, noting that the Svan homeland is close to the ancient Georgian kingdom of Colchis, a region with close trading connections to Greece. Some sources have noted a similarity to the Greek goddess Artemis, who was also a patron of wild animals and hunting, although unlike Dali she was known for prudishness rather than promiscuity. Both were associated with transitions and boundaries, especially between civilization and the wilderness. = Near Eastern goddesses = Writing in the 1940s, the Georgian author Demna Shengelaya examined Dali as an equivalent of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, identifying themes of matriarchy struggling against patriarchal values reflected in the stories of each. Virsaladze found similarities between Dali and several related Near Eastern deities including Ishtar, the Phrygian goddess Cybele, Phoenician Astarte, and Carthaginian Tanit, noting that all of these goddesses were associated with a mortal lover in a story cycle that represented the transition to spring and the cyclical rebirth of nature. She particularly stressed the similarities between Dali and Ishtar: sovereignty over animals, an association with dawn, and a sexual aggressiveness that was feared by men. She suggested the possibility that the mythology surrounding Dali represented a preserved form of \\"a very ancient cycle of traditions and songs about the interrelations of the mistress, patroness, or sovereign, of the beasts, forest, crags and waters, with a mortal young man.\\" According to Virsaladze, this mythological motif is a fragment of a matriarchal belief system which venerated nature and life-giving mother deities, later supplanted by patriarchal ideology. alt=Stone figurine of female clutching her breasts Drawing on the work of earlier writers such as Walter Burkert and Paul Friedrich, Tuite described mythological similarities between Dali and several other similar goddesses who have parallel motifs possibly indicating mutual influence. Foremost among these similarities are an association with gold (both as a color and as a precious metal), fertility and patronage of animals, seductive behavior combined with destructive jealousy, and a connection to dawn or the morning star. He refers to these similarities as the \\"dawn goddess complex\\". Goddesses with some or all of these features include the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess Hausōs, and two Greek deities likely descended from her, the dawn goddess Eos and the love goddess Aphrodite. He also highlights the Sumerian goddess Inanna, and her Babylonian counterpart Ishtar as sharing these parallel motifs, despite not being derived from Hausōs. Tuite identifies the overarching themes of the dawn goddess complex as ambiguity and transition. He notes that the mythological associations of these goddesses serve as symbols for larger concepts such as transitions between night to day, old to new, and birth to death. In Dali's case, her identification with both the morning star and New Year's Eve directly reinforce her status as a patron of transitions. Archaeologist Elena Rova, drawing on Tuite's work, wrote that there appears to be evidence of the transmission of symbols and beliefs between the Mesopotamian and Georgian peoples during the Bronze Age. She described the 2014 discovery of a fragment of a decorated sandstone plaque in the Aradetis Orgora mounds on the Dedoplis Mindori archaeological site in Georgia as the basis for this speculation. The plaque, attributed to the 14th–13th centuries BCE, features a nine-pointed star similar to the eight-pointed star of Ishtar. Rova believed that the star design may have been passed from Mesopotamia to Georgia through long-distance trade of the item itself or indirect memetic transmission of the design. It may then have been appropriated for use as a symbol of a local solar goddess such as Dali, possibly because some of Ishtar's features were similar enough to Dali \\"for the symbol of the latter to have been consciously chosen by the local population in order to symbolise a local goddess.\\" = Western European figures = The gentle and pensive maiden has the power to tame the unicorn, fresco, probably by alt=Fresco of woman holding unicorn David Hunt compared the hunting mythology surrounding Dali to the western European concept of the unicorn and the lady who tames it. He noted that stories of the unicorn typically focus on hunting, often in high mountains. Traditional descriptions of the unicorn include features which are characteristic of goats and deer, such as cloven hooves. In turn, hoofed animals are important prey for the hunters of the Caucasian mountains and feature heavily in their mythology. Dali's favored animals were marked in ways that make them similar to the unicorn; in particular, they were often pure white or single-horned. Finally, he found a parallel between the motif of a lady taming the unicorn and the recurring idea of a goddess or supernatural mistress who protects wild game animals. Although he admitted that the evidence was \\"circumstantial and sparse,\\" he suggested that the unicorn story originated from ancient European hunting mythology, which he believes was preserved in the mythology of the Caucasus after fading elsewhere. Hilda Ellis Davidson and Anna Chaudhri found similarities between stories of Dali and the glaistig of the Scottish Highlands. The glaistig was commonly described as a hag who lived high in the mountains and protected hoofed game animals. Like Dali, the glaistig could be both helpful and malicious, depending on the story in question. Although protective of her animals, in some stories the glaistig would allow them to be hunted, as long as the hunters were respectful and left appropriate offerings to her. In other stories, the glaistig would pose as an old woman and prey on hunters staying in mountain huts called bothies. Both Dali and the glaistig use their supernaturally-strong hair as bindings; Dali binds hunters directly, while the glaistig binds hunting dogs so she can safely attack their masters. Davidson and Chaudhri concluded that Dali and the glaistig each represent a local version of an archetypal figure of a female guardian of the wilderness, which they suggested is a widespread mythological theme. Dali represents a preserved form of the myth, where the goddess retains her power and her beauty. In contrast, the glaistig represents an altered form, where the goddess has been reduced to an ugly hag and is accorded significantly less respect. They argue that similar figures who ranging from seductive to disturbing were once widespread across various European places and cultures, referencing the forest women of Scandinavia, Greek Artemis, and the Irish Cailleach. The later forms where the guardian figure is ugly or wicked represent a version that became prominent after respect for the earlier goddess figures had withered.  Modern legacy  alt=Landscape of Venus with black sky. Dali has retained cultural significance among Georgians into the modern day, particularly in more rural areas where hunting is still practiced as a profession. A survey conducted in 2013 found that, while most people who were either younger or more educated considered Dali to be mythological, many elderly hunters still thought of Dali as a real figure, although not one that any of them had personally encountered. They recounted stories to the researchers of hunters they knew who had encountered Dali and been injured or driven mad as a result. In the modern era, eponyms and literary allusions to Dali indicate the persistence of her narrative in the cultural memory. The Dali Chasma and the Tkashi-mapa Chasma on Venus are named for Dali and her Mingrelian equivalent Tkashi-Mapa. Capra dalii, a fossil species of goat discovered in Georgia, is named for Dali. Fragments of Capra dalii fossils were first located at the Dmanisi archaeological site in 2006, and are believed to be related to the west Caucasian tur, Capra caucasica. Celebrated Georgian novelist Konstantine Gamsakhurdia wove numerous figures from Georgian folklore, including Dali, into his 1936 novel Stealing the Moon. The Georgian author Grigol Robakidze integrated Dali into his 1932 German-language novel Megi – Ein georgisches Mädchen in the form of the character Ivlite. He stated that he intended the novel to present a realistic woman who embodied the characteristics of the mythical Medea. Two poems composed after the accidental death of the famed Svan mountain climber Mikhail Khergiani in 1969 refer to Dali mourning his loss. In 2019, the town of Lentekhi removed a figure of Dali from the design of a large fountain planned for the city's main square. The original proposal featured a statue of Dali, nude, standing atop a large rock, with three ibexes standing on the rock beneath her. Metropolitan Stephan of the Georgian Orthodox eparchy of Tsageri and Lentekhi strongly criticized the inclusion of the goddess as idolatry, although mayor Badri Liparteliani stated the change was intended to increase the fountain's efficiency and visual appeal. The final version was built without the statue of Dali, and simply features three ibexes sitting atop a rock.
