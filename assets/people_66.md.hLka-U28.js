This includes the Sheedis (who have been settled in Sindh, Gujarat and Karnataka for approximately 400 to 500 years) and Kaffirs in Sri Lanka.  East African slave trade (15th century - 19th century)  The slave trade in Asia predates the Atlantic slave trade. It is generally believed that it was smaller in scale, though accurate records were seldom kept, not because they were transporting fewer people, but also because traders would intentionally not bother documenting their transactions.Harris, J. E. (1971). The African Presence in Asia. Evanston: Northwestern University. During the 16th century, Portugal was trying to control sea access to India and needed slave labour to build its empire. This spiked the demand for slaves, who (due to the Portuguese shortage of personnel) were mainly used for navy and military defence, and at other times for business, farms, domestic help, teachers, and priests. By the 17th century, a struggle for imperialism grew among the British, French and Dutch. The French and Dutch required slave labour for plantations, farming, and agriculture, respectively. Whilst the British required slaves for their navy, marine yards and for work as caulkers in the East India Company. The battle for supremacy in the area eventually led to the British domination, which lasted until the 19th century.Jayasuriya, S. D., & Pankhurst, R. (2003). \\"On the African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean\\". In S. d. Jayasuriya, & R. Pankhurst, The African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean (pp. 7-17). Trenton: Africa World Press.  Conditions for Afro-Asian slaves  Although slavery was oppressive and brutal in India and slaves were flogged or forced to work with little food, some gained access to some wealth and power, particularly during the Muslim era.Basu, H. (2003). \\"Slave, Soldier, Trader, Faqir: Fragments of African Histories in Western India (Gujarat)\\". In S. d. Jayasuriya, & R. Pankhurst, The African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean (pp. 223-250). Trenton: Africa World Press As slaves, the Sheedi were allowed some degree of social mobility so it was possible for them to be placed in high positions within the military and governing bodies.Oka, R., & Kusimba, C. (2007). \\"Siddi as Mercenary or as African Success Story on the West Coast of India\\". In J. C. Hawley, India in Africa Africa in India: Indian Ocean Cosmopolitans (pp. 203-224). Bloomington: Indiana University Press. Muslim slaves were also allowed to become educated, marry freely, become political advisers, recruit other slaves through purchase, inducements, or capture. Slavery in the Indian subcontinent was not the same as chattel slavery that was found in the Atlantic, where people were treated like property. Most slaves were domestics or worked in the military, navy, or other trades. They could gain their freedom over time. The slavery practised in South Asia encouraged integration and assimilation. Abolition of slavery By the 18th century, the British had abolished the slave trade but efforts by the British in the Indian Subcontinent and other European imperialists were made to circumvent this. However, across all eras, there was a steady demand for personal slaves employed as domestic helpers. They were seen as indicators of high social status.Alpers, E. (2003). \\"The African Diaspora In the Indian Ocean: A Comparative Perspective\\". In S. D. Jayasuriya, & R. Pankhurst, The African Diaspora In the Indian Ocean (pp. 19-51). Africa World Press. The economic situation of the people determined the demand for slaves and was the underlying factor in the nature of slavery that developed in the Indian Subcontinent. During the era of British and other European imperialism and colonialism, the Afro-Asians became further marginalised as the imperialists brought in attitudes about race into a complicated social and class system. Many of the Afro-Asians were systematically divided into settlements so that they could not politically organise. Instead, they were encouraged to assimilate.  Assimilation and acculturation  Due to the type of slavery that encouraged assimilation, many Afro-Asians assimilated into the mainstream culture of British India and adopted the language, religion, names, and rituals of the surrounding cultures. The formerly enslaved adopted the culture of their former slave masters (both Indian and British). Many Sheedis still retain some of their African traditions. Many Sheedis are either Muslim (mainly in Pakistan) or Hindu (mainly in India). A minority are Christian (both Protestant and Catholic). In recent years, after the World Conference Against Racism in Durban South Africa, many have tried to organise politically so that they can improve their poor economic conditions. Influences on Afro- Asian culture =Sports = There have been athletes who rose to fame in the fields of running and wrestling. Afro-Asian Diaspora in South Asia =African Diaspora in India= The Siddis are the largest settlement of slave descendants in India, many settled around the western coast and hinterland in cities like Janjira, Gujarat and Goa. Today, it is estimated there about 6,000-7,000 Siddis in Gujarat (India) and 400 in Mumbai.Basu, H. (2003). \\"Slave, Soldier, Trader, Faqir: Fragments of African Histories in Western India (Gujarat)\\". In S. d. Jayasuriya, & R. Pankhurst, The African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean (pp. 223-250). Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press. =African Diaspora in Pakistan= Pakistani African descents consist of the \\"Makrani\\", \\"Sheedi\\" or \\"Habshi\\". The Makrani (Urdu/Persian: ŸÖ⁄©ÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å) are the inhabitants of Makran coast of Balochistan in Pakistan and lower Sindh. The Siddis (Sheedi) in Karachi live in the area of Lyari and other nearby coastal areas. Although most people use the term Siddis to describe many of the African populations in Pakistan, they are not all Siddis. Shada ayesha The Sheedis are divided into four clans or houses: Kharadar Makan, Hyderabad Makan, Lassi Makan and Belaro Makan. The Sufi saint Pir Mangho is regarded by many as the patron saint of the Sheedis and the annual Sheedi Mela festival, is the key event in the Sheedi community's cultural calendar. Some glimpses of the rituals at Sidi/Sheedi Festival 2010 include visit to sacred alligators at Mangho pir, playing music and dance. Black African identity Many of Afro-Pakistanis are described to have \\"assimilated\\" themselves into the \\"dominant culture\\". The Sheedis have assimilated into Pakistani Baloch culture; the instrument, songs and dance of the Sheedis appear to be derived from Africa. Linguistically, Makranis are Balochi and Sindhi and speak a dialect of Urdu referred to as Makrani. Their local culture has been influential in shaping the dominant culture of Pakistan. The musical anthem of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, Bija Teer, is a Balochi song in the musical style of the Sheedis with Black African style rhythm and drums. =African Diaspora in Sri Lanka= The Sri Lankan Kaffirs (cafrinhas in Portuguese, rendered as kƒÅpiriy≈ç (‡∂ö‡∑è‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í) in Sinhala and kƒÅpili (‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Æø) in Tamil), are a Sri Lankan community that emerged in the 16th-century due to Portuguese colonialism. Imperialism When Dutch colonialists arrived in about 1600, the Kaffirs worked on cinnamon plantations along the southern coast. The Kaffirs ancestors were chained up and forced by the Dutch to take on the Sinhalese Kingdom. After the Dutch were successfully repelled by the Sinhalese in 1796, the Kaffirs were further marginalized by an influx of Indian laborers, who were imported by the British and who took most work on tea and rubber estates. The descendants of the original Africans or Kaffirs survive in pockets along the island's coastal regions of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Negombo. African identity Sri Lankans of African descent are proud to be Sri Lankans. They also acknowledge their African history. Kaffirs have an orally recorded history by the families who are descendants of former Sinhalese slave traders. A substantial population among those Sri Lankans of African descent are believed to have roots in the region that today corresponds to the Republic of Mozambique. The community's classical traditions of dance and song performance are described as the strongest indicators of the communities cultural retention of and fidelity in preserving Africa's ancient traditions of religions, culture and civilization. The term Kaffir means 'non-believer' in the Arabic language, though it does not hold the same pejorative implications of the word as it would in countries like South Africa; its continued use by certain sections of Sri Lankan people is defended on the basis that term is not intended to be used as a racial slur. Many Sri Lankans of African descent speak what has been described as a \\"creole\\" mixture of both the Sinhalese and Tamil languages. The community of Sri Lankans of African descent are also described as having been \\"assimilated\\" over the years as they have married Tamils and Sinhalese Sri Lankans. =Afro-Sri Lankans today= The education level of the community is consistent with that of rural Sri Lankan populations. They have become dis- empowered (they were used as soldiers by the Europeans) since the European colonizers have left the island and have tried to find their role in Sri Lankan society.

Illustration from Mary MacGregor, Stories of the Vikings (1908). Kn√©setja (lit. \\"knee-setting\\"; German Kniesetzung) is the Old Norse expression for a custom in Germanic law, by which adoption was formally expressed by setting the fosterchild on the knees of the foster-father. Germanic law When prince Haakon, the youngest son of Harald Fairhair was brought to the court of √Üthelstan, the Norwegian messenger, Haukur, simply placed the child on the king's knees as soon as he came into his presence. By this act, Haakon had been adopted by Aethelstan, which also implied an insult to the English king as the foster-father was usually of lower standing than the real father. Aethelstan became angry and wanted to kill the child on the spot, but Haukur simply said that since he was now the child's foster-father it was up to him whether he wanted to kill him and went away. Aethelstan let the child live and had him baptized. (Heimskringla, Harald Harfager's Saga). The same gesture was also part of the formal ceremony of both engagement and marriage in early Scandinavian law. Here, the bride was set on the knees of the groom.\\"Eherecht\\" in Johannes Hoops, Heinrich Beck (eds.), Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, vol. 6, Walter de Gruyter, 1986, , p. 496. Indo-European parallels The Germanic procedure of Kniesetzung has parallels in various other Indo-European cultures, and has been suggested to derive from a custom in Proto-Indo-European society in comparative philology since the 1920s, although evidence for this is considered inconclusive. In Hittite texts of the Late Bronze Age, specifically the mythological texts of the Song of Ullikummi and the Story of Appu, there are accounts of how, after the birth of the son, the father accepts the newborn from the midwife and as a sign of the son's legitimacy sets him on his knee and names him.G√ºterbock, Kumarbi.

He was best known for his ballad-style poems in Cumbrian dialect. Life Robert Anderson was born on 1 February 1770, the youngest child of nine when his parents were already old. He received his education in various places, including a charity school attached to the cathedral and then under different masters, although he was with none for very long. Having mastered the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, he was sent to work to help support his family at the age of ten, initially under an elder brother who was a calico printer. Having some artistic ability, he was apprenticed in 1783 to a pattern drawer and eventually went to London for five years for further training. While there he started writing - \\"Lucy Gray of Allendale\\" being the first of his compositions. This and others written that year were set to music by the composer James Hook and performed to some applause in 1794. In 1796 he returned to support his father in Carlisle and found work with a firm there. Two years later his English Poems on Various Subjects were published by subscription.Google Books Afterwards he turned to lighthearted humorous poems in dialect and the first edition of Ballads in the Cumbrian dialect was published in Carlisle in 1805.Google Books Since music was a favourite diversion of his, he composed the music to accompany many of these himself. In 1808, following the death of his father the year before, Anderson left for another position near Belfast, calling on the way to visit the grave of one of his principal influences, Robert Burns. While there he published in the local papers and particularly a series of four \\"Enigmas\\" in the Belfast Commercial Chronicle which sparked a brief fad of imitation.Poetical Works 1820 p,219 Eventually he had to return to England, since the calico trade was in decline, and was welcomed back to Carlisle with a civic reception. To help relieve his poverty, a new edition of his poems, The Poetical Works of Robert Anderson, was published from the city in 1820, for which he contributed an autobiographical essay.Published in two volumes: vol. 1 and vol. 2 are both available on Google Books. This edition attracted over 1000 subscribers, among them the then poet laureate, Robert Southey, and his eventually successor, William Wordsworth. Anderson's last years were marked by intemperance and the fear of ending his days in the workhouse. But, though he died very poor, he was saved from that fate by the financial support of friends. After his death, he was buried in the grounds of Carlisle Cathedral, and a memorial was raised there with a medallion likeness and the inscription \\"Erected by public subscription to the memory of Robert Anderson, the Cumberland Bard, died in Carlisle, 26 Sept. 1833, aged 63 years\\".Gravestonepix The centenary edition of Anderson‚Äôs Cumberland Ballads and Songs was published in 1904. His death was marked by a centenary celebration souvenir, Robert Anderson, the Cumberland Bard, in 1933. Two late silhouette portraits of the poet are now in the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery,Portsmouth University as is his death mask.Treasures of Cumbria There is also a head and shoulders portrait of the poet attributed to John Hazlitt in which he is wearing the same neatly knotted neckcloth as in the silhouettes.BBC Your Paintings Poetry in Cumberland dialect Although Anderson was largely responsible for the contemporary popularisation of English dialect poetry, his 1805 Ballads were far from the first. His work had been preceded the year before by the Miscellaneous Poems of John Stagg. In consequence of their championship of the region, Stagg was to be called ‚ÄòThe Cumbrian Minstrel‚Äô and Anderson ‚ÄòThe Cumberland Bard‚Äô.Archibald Sparke, A bibliography of the dialect literature of Cumberland and Westmoreland, Kendal 1907 But they were only following in the footsteps of the 18th century ‚ÄòCumberland Muse‚Äô, Susanna Blamire. A member of the gentry, she had written songs in Scots that were set to music by Joseph Haydn. Her work in Cumbrian dialect was less well known until the vogue established by Anderson. There had been other well educated precursors in the 18th century who had already used dialect in their poetry. One of the earliest was the Rev. Josiah Relph, whose imitations of Theocritan Pastorals self-consciously introduce the demotic for local colour. Although written about 1735, they were not published until after the author's death in A Miscellany of Poems (Wigton, 1747).Online archive The Rev. Robert Nelson followed him in the same tradition with A choice collection of poems in Cumberland dialect (Sunderland, 1780).World Cat Ewan Clark, a contemporary of Nelson's, also wrote a handful of dialect imitations that were included in his Miscellaneous Poems (Whitehaven 1779). The year of the publication of Ballads in the Cumbrian dialect (1805) also saw a third edition of Relph's poems. Earlier there had been a 1797 edition, a copy of which Anderson had sent to a female friend accompanied by a verse epistle.Poems on various subjects, p.104 The work of these earlier writers was to be incorporated with poems by some of Anderson's contemporaries in anthologies that followed the popular reprints of his ballads, always stressing their Cumbrian affiliation. One such collection was Ballads in the Cumberland dialect, chiefly by R. Anderson (1808, second edition 1815, Wigton),Google Books which included poems by Miss Blamire and other anonymous female writers, Ewan Clark and Mark Lonsdale, as well as woodcuts in the style - or from the workshop - of Thomas Bewick. The influence of the earlier pastoral style is manifest in the many dialogue poems there, including Anderson's own work. A more ambitious anthology of dialect verse, Dialogues, poems, songs, and ballads, by various writers, in the Westmoreland and Cumberland dialects, followed from London in 1839.pp.213-303 Anderson's verse Anderson's work in standard English went on to include long narratives, which were added to his lyrics and occasional poems. These were collected together with his dialect poems in the 1820 Poetical Works, but there was still much of his that remained unpublished among his manuscripts. After his death a good proportion, some 130 pieces, including extra verses and other changes by its own account, were added to Anderson‚Äôs Cumberland Ballads, published from Wigton in 1840.Google Books Even so, this was limited to his dialect writing. His opera, \\"The Chief of Skye\\", was never published and remained unknown apart from some biographical mentions.Dialogues, poems, songs, and ballads, by various writers, in the Westmoreland and Cumberland dialects, London 1839, p.218 A cockfight outside a country inn by Thomas Bewick Mark Huggins has commented on Anderson that he \\"was a man of the people, and most of his songs were about real individuals, whose names appear in parish registers of the time.\\"Mike Huggins, Robert Anderson, \\"The Cumberland Bard\\": an overlooked source for sporting life in the rural margins of late eighteenth century England, Sports Literature Association 2008, Academic Library Online He celebrated the area's small towns, farms, fairs, markets and landscape, addressing the life of the inhabitants: their work, loves, feasting, drinking, dancing and cockfights. His ballads are full of human interest and playful humour, with an eye to the ridiculous that does not demean his subjects. A handful of these ballads were to enter the oral tradition and be collected by folk song enthusiasts in the early 20th century. Four in particular are still recognised as classics: \\"Barbary Bell\\",Folk Music \\"Sally Gray\\",Joe Offer \\"The Blackwell Merry Night\\",Mainly Norfolk and \\"Canny Cumberland.Folk Music As commonly happens with oral material, their text changed as the original authorship was forgotten. The most radical example of this occurred in the later history of \\"Jenny‚Äôs Complaint\\". Adapted to the mining circumstances of southern Cumbria, it lived a life of its own, divorced from the tune Anderson wrote for it, as \\"The Recruited Collier\\".Tim Chesterton, \\"Faith, Hope and Charity\\", online Anderson's earliest poem, \\"Lucy Gray of Allendale\\", provides a somewhat similar example of transforming influence in the literary sphere. There is some confusion here, since one of the ‚ÄòLucy poems‚Äô written by William Wordsworth during his 1799-1800 tour of Germany actually is titled \\"Lucy Gray\\". It was, by his account, based on the story of a Halifax girl who lost her way in the snow, although a claim has also been made that he may have been remembering Christopher Anstey‚Äôs ballad, \\"The Farmer‚Äôs Daughter\\".Robert C. Whitford, \\"Another Lucy\\", The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, Vol. 18, No. 3, July 1919, pp.369-71 The story of Anderson's \\"Lucy Gray\\" was related to him by a Northumbrian rustic about a village beauty who died at seventeen and was followed to the grave by her lover. This fits the scene depicted in another of Wordsworth's Lucy poems, \\"She dwelt among the untrodden ways\\". The likeness between the poems is particularly noteworthy in the first draft of Wordsworth's poem. His five stanzas in standard ballad metre are matched by Anderson's six, and both begin with flower imagery, although it is not so obvious in Wordsworth's final published version, in which he removed the original first and fourth stanzas.Elizabeth Gowland, A reading of Wordsworth‚Äôs Lucy poems, Simon Fraser University 1980, [summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/3890/b12280495.pdf pp.27-8] This succinctness makes far more pointed the revelation that the speaker is Lucy's lover; that only emerges in Wordsworth's final stanza but enters Anderson's poem at a much earlier point. Wordsworth himself does not acknowledge an influence and the only evidence that he had heard of Anderson is his subscription to the 1820 Poetical Works. Anderson had started writing at a time when the Scots dialect poetry of Robert Burns was spawning fashionable imitations. His initial impulse to write had sprung from disgust at songs \\"written in a mock pastoral Scottish style\\" that he had encountered while in London.Poetical Works, p.xxiv But this did not prevent him from writing in the same debased Lallans that he deprecated. Indeed, beside the lyrics of his in standard English set by James Hook, several others were in Anderson's derivative Scots, including \\"Donald of Dundee\\", \\"Bonny Jem\\", \\"Muirland Willy\\", \\"Dearly I love Johnny O\\" and \\"The Press Gang\\". He also used it later in a verse epistle addressed to Burns and in his narrative poems, \\"The Harper\\", \\"The Dying Harper\\" and \\"Fair Margaret's Bower\\". Shortly after his death, some of his lyrics were published alongside those of his model in the chapbook Burns' songs and Anderson's Cumberland ballads (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1839).Burns Museum By comparison with his writing in Scots, Anderson's own dialect work was more uncompromising and brought better success.Romantic masculinities, Edinburgh U 1997 p.49 References The bulk of the details of Anderson's life are drawn from the autobiographical essay at the head of the 1820 edition of his poems.

Bouygues Development is the UK property arm of international services group Bouygues.  History  Derwent Living was founded in 1964 to provide co-ownership housing for first time buyers. During its first 10 years, homes were provided in Derby, Nottingham, Loughborough and the West Midlands. In the mid-to-late 1970s, a Housing Association Grant allowed it to build much of its housing stock. As grants decreased during the 1980s, the company switched its development focus from houses to flats for single people, couples and sheltered schemes for the elderly. During the 1990s, Derwent Living moved into providing student accommodation and offering maintenance and housing management services to other landlords. The 2000s saw a substantial increase in the amount of student accommodation offered, as well as Keyworker accommodation for NHS staff. As house prices in England rose to outstrip salaries, demand for part-buy part-rent options increased. As the house market began to decline they introduced a ‚ÄòTry before you buy‚Äô scheme - renting a property for up to three years at a reduced costs whilst saving for the deposit to buy the property. This was picked up by the Homes and Communities Agency, who promoted the scheme nationally as ‚ÄòRent to Homebuy‚Äô.  The Butterfly Project  In 2009, Derwent Living was awarded first place in the Complex Needs category at the Guardian Public Services Awards for 'The Butterfly Project'. The project provides a refuge for women who are victims of domestic violence and who also suffer from mental health problems or drug and alcohol addiction.

It operated as the flagship store of the Simpsons department store chain from 1895-1991\\\\. The building became the area flagship store of its successor The Bay in 1991 (rebranded to Hudson's Bay in 2013), and was retrofitted to house the first Saks Fifth Avenue in Canada in 2016. It is also the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, which owns both chains. Hudson's Bay Company sold the complex to Cadillac Fairview in 2014, and maintains a leaseback agreement with the company through at least 2039. It is now considered part of the CF-owned Toronto Eaton Centre, although a skybridge had already been connecting the adjacent properties for convenience since the 1970s. History =1895-1991: Simpsons= The 1896 sandstone building located on Queen Street slightly west of Yonge Street was built by Toronto firm of Burke and Horwood for Simpson's Department Store in the Romanesque Revival style with Chicago School influences. The fireproof steel frame structure replaced the original 6-storey store that burned in 1895 just three- months after opening. The store was built to replace the original Simpson's dry goods business at 184 Yonge Street and was located directly across from rival retailer's Eaton's Annex. The store's interior featured an open atrium that extended from the ground to the sixth floor. In addition to other departments, the basement featured a coffee shop and discount division. In 1954, it was connected to the Queen subway station and later to the PATH network. In the early 20th Century, a Dominion supermarket (City Hall Market) occupied the northeast corner of the ground floor. It closed in the 1960s. The store outgrew the capacity of the structure by 1900, leading to the first of several expansions. Burke and Horwood returned with additions in 1907 and 1923. The largest expansion came in 1929 with Chapman and Oxley's nine-floor Art Deco addition (facing Bay and Richmond) capped by the Arcadian Court. When construction completed, the store occupied two full city blocks. In 1969, John B. Parkin's Simpson Tower was added to the complex at the corner of Queen Street West and Bay Street to house Simpson's offices. Unlike Eaton's, the store survived the remaking of the neighbourhood and retained the original look. A glass-enclosed bridge was added in the late 1970s to allow customers to access the Toronto Eaton Centre without braving the elements or traffic. Today's Special, a children's television series that aired on TVOntario and in the United States on Nickelodeon during the 1980s, utilized the location for several scenes. =1991-present: Hudson's Bay= The Bay Queen Street north facade In 1991, the Simpson's name was replaced with the banner The Bay (amended to the current \\"Hudson's Bay\\" in 2013). The Bay Queen Street continues the Simpson's tradition of Christmas-themed display windows facing Queen Street West west of the main Queen Street entrance. The complex connects to the nearby Bay Adelaide Centre and shared underground parking complex. In January 2014, HBC announced it had sold the property to Cadillac Fairview through a sale-and-leaseback arrangement, with HBC leasing the property for at least the following 25 years (with options for a further 50 years). Under the deal, the store is for the first time considered an official part of the Cadillac Fairview-owned Toronto Eaton Centre, and part of the site will be remodelled as a store of fellow HBC chain Saks Fifth Avenue, to open in 2016. In 2016, a grocery store, Saks Food Hall, was added run by Pusateri's in the basement.

It was their debut single, released on 6 March 1981, also acting as the lead single from their debut studio album, Penthouse and Pavement (1981). It was a minor hit in the UK in 1981, despite being banned by the BBC. It was also a minor dance hit in the US. It developed from an instrumental, \\"Groove Thang\\", that Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh created earlier that year for Music for Stowaways, an album they released under the British Electric Foundation name.  Details and ban by the BBC  \\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\\" was written by Heaven 17 members Martyn Ware, Ian Craig Marsh and Glenn Gregory and included on their 1981 debut album Penthouse and Pavement. It was the first single released by the band. In the lyrics fascism and racism are described in an ironic fashion, using the lexicon of funk music. The lyrics of the song also reference the UK and US political leaders of the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan, respectively, and include denunciations of both racism and fascism. According to the book Banned!: Censorship of Popular Music in Britain, 1967-92, the song was banned by the BBC due to concerns by Radio 1's legal department that it libelled Ronald Reagan as he was the new US President at the time of the song's release.  Reception and chart performance  Despite being banned by the BBC, \\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\\" reached number 45 on the UK singles chart. It debuted on that chart on 21 March 1981 and peaked one week later. The single peaked at number 72 in Australia, and was also a minor dance hit in the US, reaching number 29 on the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart in 1981. The song was ranked at number 4 among the top ten \\"Tracks of the Year\\" for 1981 by NME. Allmusic reviewer Stewart Mason describes the song as \\"clattering and jangled\\", with multiple electronic rhythm tracks played simultaneously, making the song seem faster than its nominal tempo. \\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\\" has appeared on over a dozen 80s music and dance music compilations, including Rhino Records' Postpunk Chronicles and Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s compilations.

These shapes have very small numbers, but many of them carry the same subjects as those of other Lysippides vases. =Provenance= Most of these vases appear to have been traded to Italy, especially the area around Rome, Etruria. Of the 85 vases that have listed provenances, 74 were shipped to Italy and over of 50 of these to the Etruria region. The other provenances include Sicily, Egypt and Turkey, but they appear in nominal numbers. =Subjects= Herakles is clearly the favorite subject of the Lysippides Painter. IT is also a favorite of most Group E vase- painters.Beazley, J.D. The Development of Attic Black-Figure. (pg. 63) Of the 204 vases in the Beazley Archive there are over 60 of Herakles in various forms of heroism, fighting the lion, mounting chariots with Athena, fighting Amazons (Amazonomachy), and fighting giants (Giantomachy). He is almost always shown in his lion cape, with hood resting on the back of his black hair, defined with white paint. The arms of the lion are tied around his chest (where muscles are also well defined with white lines). Warriors and fights are equally important in Lysippides' vases. Some show warriors fighting over a fallen soldier, others show battles. Almost all soldiers have Boeotiaon shields and spears, many with Corinthian helmets. They are typical of ancient Greek vases, and show glory, ar√™te and honor, all values held high by the Greeks. Other subjects include Amazonomachys, Giantomachys and scene with Dionysos, often surrounded by the double-leafed vine. While the shape of the vase is mostly considered to be chosen by the workshop, the subject could very well have been the decision of the artist himself. While these subjects chosen are typical of many Greek vases the prevalence of Herakles in Lysippides vases is certainly significant of both his style and interests. Perhaps he was commissioned for his fine work in the painting of Herakles. Certainly, the images are tenderly rendered with exquisite detail. Lysippides and Andokides It is very probable that Lysippides painter worked mostly in the Andokides workshop. The Andokides workshop was known for it more high quality pieces and Lysippides was a highly skilled black-figure painter of the time. One of the styles that came from the Andokides workshop was the bilingual vase. Beth Cohen, in 'Colors of Clay' suggests that Andokides was one of the first red-figure painters and suggests that he may have even been an inventor of the style. While creating bilingual vases with different black-figure painters, such as Lysippides, Andokides would paint one side of the vase in red-figure and another painter would paint the other in black-figure. In the case of cups, often the red-figure painter would paint the inside and the black-figure painter would paint the outside.Cohen, Beth. Colors of Clay: Special Techniques in Athenian Vases. (Los Angeles: J. Getty Museum, 2006.) Pgs. 18-32. There are six bilingual vases in the Beazley Archives attributed to both Andokides P and Lysippides P. Many archeologists have debated the validity of the bilingual model, suggesting that one artist painted the vessels. in two styles. However Cohen, with the assistance of other such as Mary B Moore, cited general differences that clearly distinguish the two styles, such as the Andokides painter‚Äôs preference for larger, more lifelike, images with less detail, and the influence of Exekias on the more conservative style of the Lysippides painter, in support of the bilingual model. While Cohen and Moore seem to consider the newly discovered technique to be more advanced and lifelike that the older black-figure style, there is something to be said for the detail and care that is clear from the stylized black-figure that adds a dimension that the red-figure is lacking. Of course, because red- figure painting was new its distinct style may not have evolved to the stage that black-figure had the chance to in their longer history.Beazley, J.D., The Development of Attic Black-Figure (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1964).

While at University he became interested in botany, and earned a gold medal for the best local collection of plants, and assisted in arranging the Indian herbarium. In 1854 he entered the Bengal medical service, and went to Calcutta. Subsequently, he went to Delhi, where he was actively engaged during the mutiny, returning to Calcutta in 1858. His health failing, he came home, and, the steamer being detained at Aden for some days, he made an interesting collection of the plants of that region, upon which he based his 'Florula Adenensis,‚Äô published in 1860. About this time he returned to India, taking temporary charge of the Calcutta Botanic Garden during the absence of Dr Thomas Thomson, whom he afterwards succeeded as director. His brother, John Anderson was a zoologist. He did much to improve the garden, and introduced valuable medicinal plants, especially cinchona and ipecacuanha: to him is due the institution of the experiments which led to the successful cultivation of the former in India, and he issued many valuable reports upon the subject. In 1864 he undertook to organise and superintend the forest department in Bengal, but after two years he was forced to abandon this work by the pressure of his other duties. In 1868 he was compelled by serious illness to return home, but subsequently recovered, and devoted himself with much energy to working out from herbaria and his own collections the flora of India. The difficult order Acanthaceae received his special attention; but before his work could be completed he was again attacked by illness, and died at Edinburgh of disease of the liver on 26 October 1870.

He was a son of Soviet Minister of State Security Viktor Abakumov, who was executed for his role in Josef Stalin's political repressions. Career Smirnov has been characterized in the media as a Rasputin-like character with \\"almost mystical powers of persuasion\\". According to his wife Rusalkina, the Soviet military enlisted Smirnov's psychotechnology in the 1980s to combat the Mujahideen and treat post-traumatic stress syndrome in Russian soldiers during the war in Afghanistan. Smirnov's background included military research, and the care of drug addiction and mental illness. He founded the Psychotechnology Research Institute at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia to work on ideas like \\"psychocorrection\\", a term he used to denote the use of subliminal messages to alter a subject's will, or even modify a person's personality without their knowledge. The Institute caught the attention of Chris Morris and Janet Morris who were reportedly attempting to sell technology to the United States military. The FBI consulted Smirnov regarding the Waco Siege in 1993. Smirnov proposed piping subliminal messages from sect members' families through the phone lines during negotiations so as to effect the surrender of David Koresh, however the FBI declined the plan. Smirnov died in November 5, 2004, leaving his wife to run the Institute. In May 2009, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced plans to award a contract for testing of an airport screening system based partly on Smirnov's concepts to ManTech SRS Technologies in association with Northam Psychotechnologies, a Canadian company acting as distributor for the Psychotechnology Research Institute.

This Microgravity Programme at the European Space Agency (ESA) is an optional programme, with currently 17 ESA member states participating. The ELIPS programme prepares and performs research on the International Space Station, and other unmanned mission platforms like Sounding Rockets, in fundamental and applied life and physical sciences. ELIPS is the continuation of the earlier European microgravity programmes EMIR 1&2, and the Microgravity Facilities for Columbus, MFC. ELIPS ELIPS (European LIfe and Physical Science in Space) is the European Space Agency's (ESA) research programme for science and application in Space. Most of the experiments are performed on the International Space Station, but also other mission platform that can provide weightlessness during shorter or longer times are utilized, such as drop towers, parabolic flights, sounding rockets and robotic orbital capsules. To prepare for future human exploration of Space, various ground-based investigations are performed, in particular bed rest studies, isolation studies (\\"analogues\\") and investigations into biological effects of radiation at ion beam facilities. The main research fields are fluid physics, material sciences, fundamental physics, physiology, biology, and exobiology. During one year roughly thirty ELIPS supported experiments are performed on ISS and with all platforms it totals about one hundred investigations. All in all about 1500 scientists are involved in the ELIPS programme. Short descriptions and results of all experiments are archived and available at the Erasmus Experiment Archive (EEA). ELIPS is an optional programme within ESA which receives subscription by 15 participating member states at the ESA councils at ministerial level, taking place every three to four years. Currently, ELIPS 4 is running covering the period 2013-2016. The ELIPS 4 period was granted a budget of 210,- MEuro. Participating countries are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Romania and Canada through its Cooperation Agreement with ESA. Next Ministerial Council is expected to take place in 2016. History The ELIPS programme was defined in 2001 and intended to cover activities for the following 5 years. The ELIPS programme prepares and performs research on the International Space Station, and unmanned mission platforms like Sounding Rockets, in fundamental and applied life and physical sciences. ELIPS is the continuation of the initial European microgravity programmes, EMIR 1&2, and the Microgravity Facilities for Columbus, MFC. From first ESA Microgravity Programme to EMIR 1&2 and the MFC Programme Around 1980 the lack of a coherent European strategy for development of microgravity research became an evident practical hurdle. The lack of coordination of funding was not a viable solution for flying beyond the first Spacelab mission. The solution became ESA's proposal to its delegations to create a Microgravity Research Programme. In January 1982, Phase-1 of that programme was a reality, supposed to fund three costly and necessary multi-user facilities - for Biology, Fluid Physics and as an additional programme, the flying of the first Sounding Rockets under ESA coordination. In February 1985 the delegations approved Phase-2 of the Microgravity Programme, from now on called European Microgravity Research Programme 1 or EMIR-1. The first funding period covered 4 years, with two extensions made in 1988 and 1991, which in essence provided an overall funding package until 1999. Thus EMIR-1 effectively covered a period of 15 years. EMIR-2 had the objective of covering the research activities until the use of the International Space Station could start, at that time foreseen to be initiated in 2001. It was only partly approved in 1995, which led to a reduced activity level for the coming many years. As the start of ISS utilisation was delayed, the funds had to be stretched, which led to a significantly lower experiment execution than had been the case in the mid-1990s. The initially 12.8 meters long Columbus Module - ESA's main contribution to the ISS - was for cost reasons gradually reduced to half - 6.4 meters. In addition a barter agreement with NASA maintained 51% of Columbus resources for ESA, the rest to be available for NASA use, under the utilisation agreement. The effect of these measures was that ESA could place four microgravity dedicated facilities in Columbus, the Microgravity Facilities for Columbus or MFC. The MFC programme was approved together with the Columbus Programme in September 1995, and provided a suite of Columbus research facilities, Biolab, Fluid Science Laboratory (FLS), Material Science Laboratory (MSL), together with the first batch of experiments.[A World without Gravity - Research in Space for Health and Industrial Processes by G. Seibert et al. European Space Agency 2001, . Concomitant with this development the Russian built space station MIR was gradually used more and more by international partners, and as such formed an essential basis for experience building, in preparation of building and utilising the coming International Space Station, ISS. Objectives of the ELIPS programme The ELIPS programme is the essential programme to ensure that the European investments in the development and exploitation of the ISS would lead to a broad range of scientific results. The ELIPS programme promotes global cooperation, maintains and strengthens international research solicitation and peer reviews. ELIPS also fosters European coordination in terms of facility development and resource utilisation. Initially, a total of 229 experiment proposals had at the time been recommended by independent peers and resided in ESA's Human Spaceflight experiment database. These proposals listed more than 1000 European scientists and almost 125 European non-space R&D; companies. Until the beginning of the era of the International Space Station, European experiment activities were originating either from the European Space Agency, ESA, or from those European countries that had independent national space programmes. Experiments were flown either on board the NASA Space Shuttle on specific Spacelab and Spacehab missions, or later - from the beginning of the 1990s - as payloads on board Russian spacecraft. The main facility for the latter became the Russian Space Station Mir, which orbited the Earth over a period of 15 years, but also the Russian unmanned Foton (in the early phase named Bion (satellite) satellite programmes were utilised by ESA. These joint activities were regulated under a number of Memoranda of Understanding and contracts stipulating the conditions under which a certain mission would be conducted, rights and duties of the partners, etc. With the ISS era beginning around 2001, the ESA utilisation science programme proper and the infrastructure aspects were separated into two related but decision-wise independent programmes. ELIPS became the science programme, whilst ISS Exploitation Programme deals with all system and operational aspects of using the ISS. Under the budget for the exploitation programme major elements have been built by ESA as key contributions to ISS. Thus, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the Columbus laboratory and the additional barter element Node 2, and the Cupola element have been key contributions. ESA's main contribution to the International Space Station is the European laboratory module Columbus. It was attached to ISS on 11 Feb 2008 during the STS-122 mission, with two participating European astronauts: Leopold Eyharts and Hans Schlegel. With this milestone, ESA gained its full utilisation rights of ISS, which is 8.3% of the non-Russian part of the station. Research plan defining the ELIPS programme ESA chose around 2000 to align the research programme in life and physical sciences with that of the EC. The EC Framework Programme was the principle model for ESA's future research approach, in particular regarding internationalisation of the research teams, although the selection process and the criteria for selection at some points were profoundly different from those of the EC. As a result, the common denominator between the aims and means that ESA has and those of the EC in general terms could be found under the headings: Health Improvement Industrial Development, and Environmental Care. ESA's capabilities in these areas were defined as a combined implementation of ground based reference experiments and activities to those implemented on board the ISS. Health Improvement aspects are addressed as a part of the human physiology and biology research related to the ISS activities, Industrial Development is represented as a topic in the foundation for the Microgravity Application Promotion Projects (MAPs) run by ESA for more than a decade, in the form of team-formation between university researchers, industry research and ESA. Environmental Care is to a significant extent related to Earth observation, which ISS offers a good platform for. European Research Plan Until the definition of the ELIPS Programme, no European research plan had been defined for implementation by the European Space Agency of research under the Manned Space Programme. The research plan was worked out on the basis of a number of criteria, one being an overall set of principle topics: Thus, starting with the ELIPS programme, a proposal should in principle fall under one of the following strategically defined main categories:ESA/PB-MG(2001)24 * Exploring Nature * Improving Health * Innovating Technologies and Processes * Caring for the environment Under these strategic headings, six main research domains naturally appear in relation to ESA's research focus, and under these disciplines fourteen so-called cornerstones are identified: * Fundamental Physics  Investigate Complex Plasmas and Dust Particles Physics, with particular emphasis on understanding the three-dimensional behaviour of particles in a plasma reproducing fundamental molecular phenomena, and aggregation processes in a vacuum or atmospheric environment, requiring weightlessness.  Study Cold Atoms and Quantum Fluids, with special significance given to the development and utilisation of a cold atom clock in space, which can attain accuracy levels unreachable on Earth. * Fluid and Combustion Physics  Study the structure and dynamics of Fluids and multi- phase systems, such as critical fluids, binary and ternary systems and granular materials, which are non-uniform on a macroscopic scale in the Earth‚Äôs gravitational field. Of singular interest are also fluid flows in a central geometry and the evolution of multiconstituent systems like foams and emulsions.  Perform Combustion experiments with gas, liquid or solid fuels, to quantitatively investigate phenomena superimposed on Earth by buoyancy convection. * Material Sciences  Measuring Thermophysical Properties of liquid metals will utilise the possibilities of containerless sample processing under conditions only attainable under weightlessness.  By eliminating gravity-induced effects, New Materials and Processes can be gained from experiments in space. This encompasses understanding the mechanisms of crystal growth and solidification of metals, inorganic and organic materials, and biological macromolecules. * Physiology  In the area of Integrated Physiology study the effects of low gravity, and other extreme conditions, on whole-body regulations, e.g. in the cardio-vascular respiratory and sensori- motor systems.  Use conditions of reduced gravity to learn about effects of load on functional elements of Muscle and Bone Physiology, e.g. muscle atrophy and bone mass turnover.  Understand in the field of Neuroscience the effects of gravity on control of posture, locomotion, and cognition. * Astro/Exobiology and Planetary Exploration  In the field of Origin, Evolution and Distribution of Life study the survivability of organisms under extreme conditions on Earth, in space, and in (simulated) planetary environments.  In Preparation for Human Planetary Exploration quantify the effects of radiation doses and investigate the impact of isolation in high- stress environment on humans. In addition, develop the scientific knowledge base for identification and utilisation of in-situ resources. Also study the Life Support for long duration planetary missions. * Biology  Examine in the area of Cell and Developmental Biology the effects of an altered gravitational environment on the development of the cell and the whole organism, including reproduction, with special emphasis on signal transduction, gene expression and neural development.  Study in the field of Plant Physiology mechanosensory elements, e.g. genes and proteins, involved in gravitropism.  In the area of Biotechnology study under conditions of weightlessness of transmembrane and intracellular flux of mediators controlling cell potency and differentiation as well as cell-matrix interaction. =Selection Process= The ELIPS programme covers all aspects of selection, developing the necessary hardware and providing flight opportunities for the experiments. ESA is being guided by independent experts in its Advisory Committees as well as the European Science Foundation (ESF) in defining the science priorities under the ELIPS programme. As an outcome of these discussions, the ESF recommended the ELIPS programme proposal and the underlying Research Plan. The selection process of individual experiments or projects starts with dedicated calls from ESA to the scientific community to submit proposals. This is called Announcement of Opportunities (AO). The last major AO for ISS was in 2009, where the one for experiments in Life Sciences was internationally coordinated with NASA, JAXA and CSA and named ILSRA-09 (International Life Science Research Announcement). In parallel ESA issued the AO-2009 for physical sciences on ISS and physics/lifescience experiments on Sounding Rockets. For some less complicated platforms, as drop tower and parabolic flights, ELIPS is open to receive proposals at any time. Research proposals are scientifically evaluated by independent experts (peer review) and if found favourably an initial feasibility assessment is performed. Overall successful candidates are forwarded to ESA's Programme Board for Human Spaceflight, Microgravity and Exploration for formal selection to the research pool of ELIPS projects. =Implementation= Experiments for the projects selected to the ELIPS pool are implemented as soon as practical, which to a large degree depends on the complexity and cost of the experiment. For experiments on ISS it typically takes a couple of years from selection to realisation, in few cases up to a decade. Experiment hardware is normally provided by the ELIPS programme, whereas the participating researchers have to find funds for themselves from national sources. ESA is further responsible for all transport to space, operations costs and crew resources (if on ISS). Increasingly large or complex experiments, co-operation with other ISS partners (i.e. NASA, JAXA, CSA or Roscosmos) is often sought, in particular for large or complex experiments. Raw and calibrated data from performed experiments are provided to the scientists for analyses; however the raw and calibrated data formally remain property of ESA, whilst processed data become property of the scientists. ISS Facilities In order to support the anticipated research areas on ISS, ESA has built several laboratory facilities. The main ones are Biolab, Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL), Material Science Laboratory (MSL), European Physiology Modules (EPM), and the European Drawer Rack (EDR). Under a barter agreement with NASA Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) and the Minus Eighty- Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) were provided. For exposure science outside ISS, ESA provided the European Technology Exposure Facility and (EuTEF)SOLAR with Columbus in February 2008 and was returned after 18 months. The facilities were built as multi-user facilities and for that reason provide a considerable amount of adaptability and flexibility, for individual experiments. Typically the facilities for physical sciences and biology offer accommodation of custom made experiment modules, dependent on the scientific objectives. For physiology a suite of instruments are accommodated. For material sciences research, typically furnaces are needed that allow melting and solidification of materials samples, whilst fluid sciences research to a larger extent have a need for sophisticated imaging technology on board, for in situ monitoring of the fluids when predetermined impulses and diverse stimuli are given to the fluid sample. Biology samples typically need a temperature controlled environment, both before, during and after being investigated or processed, and e.g. plant material typically needs a controlled atmosphere in terms of both light quality and gas composition. Further, biology research in these semi-automated settings need a waste management and control system. Research in the area of human physiology with onboard crew as test subjects needs certain specific measurement and stimulation equipment. A number of such multi-user modules are included in the EPM facility, whilst additional Experiment Specific Equipment has been built for specific use and setups. Finally, NASA has installed the Human Research Facility 1&2 (HRF-1&2) in Columbus, under collaborative arrangements with ESA. ESA has also deployed cardio-respiratory instruments in HRF-2 and in NASA's Destiny laboratory One general agreement between the Agencies is to avoid duplication of equipment, at the same time as sufficient back-up options would be available. Two arguments were driving this arrangement, namely 1) that equipment for space use is very costly and time-consuming to define and manufacture, and 2) that it was understood, that time and physical resources at all times would represent a significant limitation on board the ISS, such that a collaborative approach would be fostered. ELIPS funds both Space and Earth based projects Under the initial ELIPS programme proposal of 2001, a streamlining of already existing scientific activities was proposed. The purpose was to reinforce the synergetic effect between these diverse but in essence related activities, as well as it was argued that good Space experiments necessarily must be preceded by thorough ground based experiments, as well as the peer review process would score well prepared and well funded experiments higher, than experiments only built on an unconsolidated hypothesis. The activities thus suggested to form an overall entity under the ELIPS programme and to be considered for funding as such, were: * Short term weightlessness experiments in European Drop Towers (up to 4.7 sec natural weightlessness and catapulted up to more than 9 seconds) * Short term weightlessness experiments on board airplane parabolic flights (weightlessness period in the order of 20 seconds). Such flights normally apply repetitive parabolas up to 30 in one day. * Short term weightlessness experiments on board so-called Sounding Rocket campaigns from ESRANGE in Kiruna, Sweden (weightlessness periods between 6 and 10 minutes, dependent on type of rocket). * Access to European Ground Based Facilities of a unique character, such as e.g. centrifuge, accelerator and radiation facilities * Isolation studies in ground analogues, such as the Mars500 experiment simulating a complete space mission to Mars and using the Concordia station on Antarctica. Further it was suggested to continue the support of the Microgravity Application Projects (MAP), the private-public teaming between industry, universities and ESA, that had been funded initially under the EMIR programme. and the Topical Team activities, which in general supported the meeting activities of scientific groupings proposed to and selected by ESA for funding. =ELIPS programme today= In 2010 the results of the last life and physical sciences research announcement were formally approved by Human Spaceflight, Microgravity and Exploration Programme Board (PB-HME). The results of the selection have been reported, starting page 8 in the Human Spaceflight Science Newsletter, September 2010. As of June 2011 there are in total 258 experiments in the \\"research pool\\" out of which 163 are for experiments in space and the remainder for ground-based preparatory experiments.

He was particularly associated with the works of Gian Carlo Menotti, and is best remembered for creating the role of King Melchior in the world premiere of Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors. Life and career Born in Benton, Illinois, Aiken studied English at Southern Illinois Normal College, where he matriculated in 1935. While a student there he was a member of the university's choir and studied singing privately with Grace Duty in Marion, Illinois. After earning his diploma in 1939, he briefly worked as a high school English teacher and track coach before accepting a post with the St. Louis Municipal Opera. He left that position in 1942 to join the USAAC, where he was trained as a fighter pilot and commissioned as a second lieutenant. He spent the remainder of World War II flying the Consolidated B-24 Liberator for missions in both Germany and Italy. He remained a reserve officer and command pilot in the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel up through 1972.Biography of David Aiken After World War II, Aiken pursued further studies in music at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University Bloomington. Shortly after completing these studies, he made his debut on Broadway in May 1950 in the original production of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul; having replaced George Jongeyans as Mr. Kofner. After the show closed the following November, he and several of the other Broadway cast members took the show on tour for performances in Paris and London. He later returned to Broadway in March 1954 to create the role of Eddington in the original production of Sigmund Romberg's The Girl in Pink Tights. He left that show in June 1954 only to return to Broadway the following December to originate the role of Salvatore in the premiere of Menotti's The Saint of Bleecker Street.Frances Stephens. The Theatre World Annual, Rockliff, 1951.John Ardoin. The Stages of Menotti, Doubleday Press, 1985 After the critical success of The Consul, Menotti was invited by NBC to compose an opera for television which was to be performed by the newly created NBC Opera Theatre (NBCOT). What resulted was the highly successful Christmas opera Amahl and the Night Visitors which was premiered on Christmas Eve of 1951 in a national broadcast to millions. For this production, Menotti enlisted the forces of many of the singers from The Consul; including Aiken who was cast in the role of King Melchior. He continued to portray that role, along with the other original adult cast members, for annual live television broadcasts up through 1962. They also gave annual national tours of Amahl, performing with symphony orchestras in concerts throughout the United States. In 1968 Aiken joined the voice faculty at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music where he taught for many years. During the 1970s and 1980s he operated the David Aiken Touring Opera Company which presented annual tours of Amahl and the Night Visitors. Aiken directed the productions and continued to perform the role of King Melchior as well.\\"'Amahl' Has Touch of Authenticity\\", Los Angeles Times, December 6, 1983 Aiken died in Linton, Indiana, at the age of 93.

He was producing work around 575 B.C.E to 475 B.C.E, and these dates are concluded from the vases that are found and attributed to the specific painter. All of the pieces that were found and attributed to the painter of Nicosia Olpe are black figure, and this can also be determined by the dates. The majority of vases that the Painter of Nicosia painted were larger pieces, this is not something that he had control over; but he did have control over the scenes on the vases.Beazley Archive  Works  There are forty-five vases that are attributed to the Painter of Nicosia Olpe that are recorded and posted on the Beazley Archive. Out of those forty-five vases more than half of the vases are larger vase shapes such as: amphora, amphora B, neck amphora, skyphos and more. These large vases were found mostly in Italy, which means that most of the vases that the painter and workshop were producing were for Italian consumers of the time. Twelve of the forty-five vases where found in different parts of Italy such as Etruria, Capua, Nola, Taranto and South Italy as well. With the number of vases going to Italy one can conclude that there is a great need for large vases in Italy. Once again the size of the vase is not up to the painter, the content on the vase is what that painter determines. There are a greater number of larger vases being produced by the workshop, which means that the painter is able to draw and paint larger scenes of his choice. In this case the painter chose to mainly focus on departure scenes, and scenes of the God Dionysus with maenads and satyrs. There are two types of departure scenes that include horsemen or a chariot, however both of the types have youths and women.Paralipomena  Style of Works  The first type of departure scene is of men and youths getting ready to leave for the battlefield, leaving their families behind. The painter took full advantage of the size of the vase, because he chose to paint the horses from a side view, which uses more of the surface area on the vase. On the sides of the horse the painter has drawn youths and women holding spears for the warrior that is leaving . The women are painted in white paint, and the men and youths are in black . The second type of departure scene is of a full chariot and the horsemen with women and youths holding spears on the side of the chariot. The horses that are pulling the chariot are drawn in a frontal manner, meaning the faces of the horses are facing the on looker of the vase. The second theme that is very prevalent in the drawings that the painter of Nicosia Olpe did is of the God Dionysus with maenads and satyrs. Dionysus is the god of fertility in nature and also the god of wine, this is why he is usually depicted holding a gourd or a cup of some sort. Maenads are feminine creatures that are always dancing with satyrs who are masculine creatures that have tails and beards. Within these scenes Dionysus is the central figure, and surrounding him maenads and satyrs who are dancing around him as well.  Related to the painter of Nicosia Olpe  These themes of departure and Dionysus with maenads and satyrs are not only specific to the painter of Nicosia Olpe; there are other painters that paint these scenes. The fact that the painter has many departure and Dionysus themed scenes are details to note but this is not an attribute that can help differentiate that painter from other painters of his time. What is specific to the painter of Nicosia Olpe is the way he draws eyes, and this also applies to horses and other creatures such as satyrs not only to men and women. The eyes are not very elaborately drawn, it seems as if the painter drew a circle and two lines on the sides. These themes and characteristics can also help find which other painters and workshops the painter of Nicosia Olpe may have been associated, or related to. The painter of Louvre F 28 uses the same technique of drawing eyes; they are closely related. Another painter that uses this same technique is the painter of Ure‚Äôs Type A. The eyes are down in a similar manner however the way the noises are drawn different. The painter of Nicosia Olpe has a more rounded noise and the painter of Ure‚Äôs Type A has drawn a more pointed noise. A third painter or group that is associated is the group of Brussels R 300. The painter of Nicosia Olpe and the group of Brussels R 300 share the theme of Dionysus. The major difference between the two is that the group of Brussels R 300 has the maenads and satyrs moving. The action of dancing is clearly seen within the scene, because the feet of the maenads and satyrs are in a pose shows that they are moving.CVA  References  Ancient Greek vase painters ","title":"Painter of Nicosia Olpe"},{"id":"30061417","text":"Jean-Baptiste Ma√ßon was a merchant and political figure in Upper Canada.

The district headquarters are in Butemba Town. Geography The Kyankwanzi District borders with Nakaseke District to the east across the Mayanja River, Kiboga District to the south- east, Mubende and Kibaale Districts to the south-west across the Lugogo River, and Hoima and Masindi Districts to the north across the River Kafu. The district headquarters in Butemba Town on the Bukwiri-Kyankwanzi Road are approximately by road from Kampala, the nation's capital. The coordinates of the district headquarters are 1.143N, 31.602E. The district area is full of lush green forests and prairies with minor elevation differences as it is the plateau behind the western fork of the East African Rift running across the Hoima District. The altitude is roughly 1,000‚Äì1,200 meters above sea level. History Kyankwanzi District was carved out of Kiboga District by the act of Parliament in July 2010, with eight sub-counties in Kiboga North County. Prior to the creation, district services operated from Kiboga Town, approximately from Butemba. Further back in the past, Kyankwanzi District was in the Mubende region. The reasons given for forming the district, included the long distances that residents had to travel to access district services at Kiboga. The district name derives from Kyankwanzi Town, 20 km farther away from Kampala-Hoima Road, as the region is historically associated with the National Resistance Movement (NRM), which started the Ugandan Bush War of 1981-86 from cattle-herding Kyankwanzi under the direction of President Museveni. Up to this day, Kyankwanzi serves as the strong foothold of the NRM and hosts the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi Town that provides training to all serving military troops and public servants of Uganda. Meanwhile, Butemba was chosen as the district seat for accessibility and land availability reasons. Administrative units The district has only one county, Kiboga West County.Districts of Uganda, Statoids, accessed 3 August 2015Counties of Uganda, Statoids, accessed 3 August 2015 Culturally, Kyankwanzi is the northwestern frontier of the Buganda Kingdom, overseen from the Ssingo county seat of Mityana. Once belonging to Bunyoro, as Rugonjwa Sub- county, Nsambya Sub-county in the northwest was won by the Buganda Kingdom in the battles in the 1890s under Kabaka Mwanga II's rule. Demographics In 1991, the national population census estimated the district population at 43,500. The next national census in 2002 estimated the population at 120,600. In 2012, the population was estimated at 182,900. In 2009, Kyankwanzi Sub- county, then under the Kiboga District, was recorded as the poorest administrative area in the Central Region, with 38 percent of the population living on less than US$1.00 a day. Kiboga and Kyankwanzi are popular destinations for rural-to-rural migration in Uganda. The government publicly announced in the 1990s the vast land resources to attract farmers from around the country. It is now inhabited by the Soga and Masaba peoples in the east, and the Kiga and Fumbira peoples from Kigezi in the southwest, as well as indigenous Baganda, Banyoro, and the cattle-keeping Ankole people/Rwandans with a hint of Congolese refugees. Almost all residents are at least bilingual. Economic activities Crop husbandry, livestock keeping, logging/charcoal-making are the three major economic activities in the district. Because the Kyankwanzi District is located along the cattle corridor that crosses the country from south-west to north-east, many residents are of Banyankole/Banyarwanda origin who pasture Ankole cattle in the vast woodland. Cattle-keeping is mostly concentrated on Kapeke, Kyankwanzi, Nsambya Sub- county areas. In these areas, weekly or bi-monthly cattle markets are set up in major trading centres. Crop husbandry is most productive and vibrant in the Nsambya Sub-country area for its maize, beans, rice produce, as well as tobacco leaves. Nsambya crop produce is marketed to a regional town of Hoima and the capital Kampala, where traders from urban areas and as far as in South Sudan and Kenya make purchase. Food crops, both for cash and subsistence purposes, include the following: Utilizing the rich nature, Kyankwanzi is also known as a producer of forest products, namely, timber and charcoal, both of which are the country's tax revenue sources. The German company Global Woods AG has obtained a 50-year tree farming licence from the National Forestry Authority for an area of 12,186 hectares on Ugandan state land in the Kikonda Forest Reserve. Global Woods plans to plant monocultures mainly of pine (Pinus caribaea, Pinus oocarpa) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) trees on 8,000 hectares for later logging and to reserve the rest \\"for conservation\\". Local farmers were driven from the land, ending the traditional practice of grazing cattle in the woods and making charcoal for cooking and the market. Global Woods sells carbon credits, which allow the purchaser to emit more greenhouse gases than the limit agreed in the Kyoto Protocol and later international climate conferences. Carbon certificates are also the subject of a speculative financial market. Public transport to Kyankwanzi District is chiefly supported by long-distance bus services that connect Kampala with the Bunyoro capital of Hoima. Taxis, both in wagons and sedans, connect major trading centres such as Bukwiri, Ntwetwe, Kyenda, Ntunda, and Kikonda with Kiboga Town. Kyankwanzi Town is served by taxis from Bukwiri and Bukomero, beside the training participants at the National Leadership Institute who have direct shuttle services from Kampala.

It was held on a private farm near Meadows township, from Adelaide, over the Australia Day long weekend from 29 to 31 January 1972. International artists appearing were Mary Hopkin, Tom Paxton, and Edison Lighthouse; Australian artists included Blackfeather, Spectrum, Fraternity, Carson and Tamam Shud. The MCs were Jim Keays, Vince Lovegrove and Gerry Humphrys (ex-the Loved Ones).  Background  As well as pop and rock music artists, Meadows Technicolour Fair, also featured fairground attractions, underground movies shown by the Adelaide film co-op, a performance of Freak Circus by the Street Theatre Group and talks on the environment. A rock church service was held on Sunday with music provided by Adelaide bands Buffalo Drive and Earth. Held over the same long weekend as the 1972 Sunbury Pop Festival, the event attracted almost 30,000 people and featured many of the same Australian acts, as well three imported acts (singers Mary Hopkin, Tom Paxton and pop band Edison Lighthouse). It has been noted as \\"remarkable\\" that this festival attracted almost as many people as Sunbury, despite South Australia having less than 10% of the eastern states population.Sunbury Rock Festival 1972 Sledge's Power Rock Show Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs, The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band and English band Mungo Jerry were originally scheduled to perform but did not appear.

After retirement, he continued to work on race relations. His work included partaking in the creation and founding of the Lutheran Human Relations Association of America (LHRAA), and he was its first executive secretary, whose duties including editing The Vanguard, the publication of the LHRAA. Role in Civil Rights Movement Andrew Schulze's final full-time job was as the Executive Secretary of the LHRAA after a long career of working in Negro Missions for the LCMS. With the creation of the LHRAA in 1954 at Valparaiso University, he promptly began working as the organization' Executive Secretary. His work involved putting together Summer Institutes, working on promoting immigration in the LCMS and in other Lutheran bodies, and editing The Vanguard. Part of his work on integrating the LCMS involved lobbying for the Missouri Synod Pronouncement on Race Relations in 1956. Other work involved bringing speakers to the LHRAA's Summer Institute. In 1956, the speaker was Pastor Robert S. Graetz, who spoke about his participation in the Montgomery bus boycott. The purpose of these speakers was to actively work for integration. Also in 1962, Schulze participated in the \\"Albany Movement\\" in Georgia. The main purpose of the movement was to increase black voter registration. Unfortunately this movement was not as successful as other voter movements. Therefore, Martin Luther King Jr. was calling for help from religious leaders. Concerning this event, Schulze stated, \\"I have been writing about this all the time, and if I can only write and I can't put my body where my words are then I am not much of a writer.\\"Kathryn M. Galchutt, The Career of Andrew Schulze: Lutherans and Race in the Civil Rights Era (Macon: Mercer University Press, 2005), 179.

Galchutt, The Cresset, (Vol LXXIV, No. 1, pp. 14-20) They offered some prayer during their protest and had national media attention.

Galchutt, The Career of Andrew Schulze: Lutherans and Race in the Civil Rights Era, (Macon: Mercer University Press, 2005), 181.

Overview Following the success of Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams and having been voted Best New American Band by Rolling Stone, the band wished to expand their sound and shed the \\"roots\\" label, which they believed categorized their music unfairly. They returned to Los Angeles to work with producer Mike Campbell, but the sessions were shelved after disagreement arose over the album's sound. Campbell wished for the album to resemble Tom Petty's brand of 1960's rock and wanted Kurt Neumann to alter his guitar-playing style accordingly. The band, however, felt that this style did not fit their music and instead wanted a state-of-the-art production.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat;=19871030&id;=GGcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=rSoEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5369,6732204 Jerry Harrison had previously expressed interest in working with the band, an offer which they accepted after returning to Wisconsin. Drummer Guy Hoffman had taken some time off from the band to be with his newborn baby, so session drummer Rick Jaegar filled in on the album. Hoffman left the band for good shortly thereafter. The album was a departure from their rockabilly-influenced debut and featured a much bigger, heavier sound bordering on arena rock. Although it was their highest-selling album, it was not as well-received critically.

He was also a member of the Afghanistan Study Group. He wrote five books on Asian affairs and U.S. relations with Asia.

Career Selig S. Harrison graduated from Harvard University (B.A., 1948). Several articles credited to his name were published in The Harvard Crimson between 1945 and 1949. Harrison served as South Asia Correspondent of the Associated Press from 1951 to 1954, in New Delhi, returned as South Asia Bureau Chief of The Washington Post from 1962 to 1965, and served as Northeast Asia Bureau Chief of the Post, based in Tokyo, from 1968 to 1972. From 1974 to 1996, as a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he pursued investigative assignments every year in a variety of countries, especially those where he worked as a journalist, such as India, Pakistan, China, Japan, and the two Koreas. During the late 1970s Harrison conducted field research on the Baluch insurgency and Pashtun nationalism. Harrison worked as managing editor of The New Republic, served as senior fellow in charge of Asian studies at the Brookings Institution, and as a senior fellow at the East-West Center. Harrison was a professorial lecturer in Asian studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and an adjunct professor of Asian studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University. Harrison was frequently invited to testify as an expert witness before Congressional committees and lectured at the National Defense University, the National War College and the State Department's Foreign Service Institute. He appeared on The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Nightline, Morning Edition, and Talk of the Nation.http://www.ciponline.org/asia/staff/asia.htm North Korea Harrison visited North Korea eleven times, the last time being in January 2009. In the last week of May 1972, Harrison, representing The Washington Post, and Harrison Salisbury of the New York Times became the first Americans to visit North Korea since the Korean War and to interview Kim Il- sung. Following his second visit to Pyongyang in 1987, Harrison presided over a 1989 Carnegie Endowment symposium that brought together North Korean spokesmen and American specialists and officials for the first time and has reported on this meeting in his Endowment study, Dialogue with North Korea. In 1992, he led a Carnegie Endowment delegation to Pyongyang that learned for the first time that North Korea had reprocessed plutonium. On June 9, 1994, on his fourth visit, he met Kim Il Sung for three hours and won an agreement to the concept of a freeze and eventual dismantlement of the North Korean nuclear program in exchange for U.S. political and economic concessions. President Jimmy Carter, meeting Kim Il Sung a week later, persuaded the North Korean leader to initiate the freeze immediately. This opened the way for negotiations with the U.S. that resulted in the Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of October 21, 1994. Harrison favored handling North Korea through diplomacy and advocated normalizing relations, saying \\"we have got to get into diplomacy, and not go into naval exercises\\" to resolve tensions on the peninsula, and writing elsewhere that \\"the United States should move as quickly as possible to normalize relations. Normalization would speed up the denuclearization process.\\" Harrison was especially critical of \\"hard-liners\\" in the Bush Administration during the Sunshine Policy era. During the fifth round of the Six-party talks Harrison branded the officials David Addington, J.W. Crouch and Robert Joseph as an \\"Axis of Evil\\" within the administration, accusing them of undermining negotiations with North Korea and orchestrating \\"a campaign to depict North Korea as a ‚Äúcriminal regime‚Äù with which normalized relations are not possible.\\" More recently Harrison also characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak as a \\"hard-liner\\", who had \\"invited retaliation\\" from North Korea by reversing the policies of his Sunshine-era predecessors. Reputation Harrison's reputation for giving \\"early warning\\" of foreign policy crises was well established during his career as a foreign correspondent. In his study of foreign reporting, Between Two Worlds, John Hohenberg, former secretary of the Pulitzer Prize Board, cited Harrison's prediction of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War 18 months before it happened. Hohenberg wrote: \\"What Harrison foresaw came to pass, and when it happened, American editors suddenly rose up in their wrath ‚Äì as they always do at such times ‚Äì and demanded, 'why weren't we told about all of this?' They had been told at great length, but because too many editors were bored with a place like India, they weren't listening.\\" Terming Harrison \\"one of the few correspondents in all of Asia who was able to maintain a balanced point of view,\\" Hohenberg called him a model of the \\"first-rate correspondent who knows the past of the area to which he is assigned, writes with clarity and meaning of the present and has an awareness of the future.\\" More than a year before the Russians invaded Afghanistan, Harrison warned of this possibility in one of his frequent contributions to the influential journal, Foreign Policy. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, he was one of the earliest to foresee that the Soviet Union would withdraw its forces and become a leading advocate of a two-track policy designed to promote a withdrawal through a combination of military pressure and diplomatic incentives. He was also one of the few who predicted that the Kabul Communist regime would not fall immediately after the withdrawal. Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, introducing him at a hearing on February 21, 1989, one year after the withdrawal, observed that \\"with each passing day his reputation as a prophet is enhanced. I am sure it wasn't easy for Mr. Harrison, in the face of a phalanx of analysts, academicians, and others who were all saying the opposite, to maintain his position, but he had the intellectual fortitude and moral strength to stick by his guns, his analytical guns, and I think he deserves credit for that.\\" Some of Harrison's writings on North Korea have been challenged by other voices in the media. B.R. Myers doubted Harrison's assertion that, based on discussions with North Korean officials, there is a long-running \\"hawks vs. doves\\" split within its ranks, stating that \\"there may well be differences of opinion inside the military-first regime, but they almost certainly do not rise to the level of a hawk-dove split, and even if they did, they would never be divulged to outsiders.\\" In the wake of the inter-Korean tensions that followed the North Korean shelling of the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong in November 2010, Harrison proposed that the United States solve the crisis by redrawing the Northern Limit Line southward to a position more favorable to North Korea, with South Korea allowed no veto in the matter. Harrison's editorial was roundly criticized in the pages of the major South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, and characterized as \\"simplistic and inaccurate\\" in The Korea Herald.

It peaked at number 94 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album's sixth track, \\"You Don't Get Much\\" appears in the 1989 movie The Wizard during the opening scene. Overview In 1987, the band met producer/engineer Jim Scott while recording with Robbie Robertson on his debut album. They began recording with him in 1988. Following the mixed reception of Outside Looking In, the band wished to approach their next album differently. They added keyboardist Michael Ramos to their lineup and recruited Kenny Aronoff, known for his work with John Mellencamp, to record drums. Most of the tracking was done live in an abandoned shoe factory in downtown Milwaukee, a space that they had previously rented for rehearsals. Over 22 songs were recorded during this time, several of which can be found on the Leftovers rarities collection. In many ways, the album continued along both the roots-influenced sound of their debut and the harder-hitting 80's rock sound of their second record. U2's influence was also evident on this album through Neumann's ambient guitar playing. Overall, the album was very well received by fans and critics. Reception Music critic William Ruhlmann, writing for AllMusic, wrote of the album: \\"Things had changed for this band over three albums: initially, they sounded so style- bound that you wondered if any growth was possible, but with this album they were charging off in half-a -dozen directions at once.\\" Likewise, Fred Goodman of Rolling Stone said, \\"That the BoDeans are able to rise above the song's one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B structure and create a deeply moving and personal piece of music bodes well for their future.

Released in 1991, the album peaked at number 105 on the Billboard 200 chart. Overview Despite the critical success and cult following generated by their first three albums, the band had yet to score a high-charting single and was prompted by their record label to work with a more mainstream producer. After taking a more stripped-down approach to Home, the band was ready to try a new direction and recruited David Z., best known for his work with Prince and Fine Young Cannibals, to produce their next record. In 1990, they traveled to Prince's Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, MN to begin tracking live on the soundstage. Rafael \\"Danny\\" Gayol, their session drummer on the Home tour, provided drums on the album and subsequently became a full member of the band. The resulting album was more synthesized and accessible than their previous releases, though it did not chart as high as expected. Nonetheless, it received mostly positive reviews and \\"Good Things\\", \\"True Devotion\\", \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Naked\\" all became staples in their live set. At the time of its release, \\"Good Things\\" received significant radio airplay and remains one of their most popular songs. Reception Music critic Brian Mansfield, writing for AllMusic, wrote of the album: \\"The band hardly sounds like the roots-oriented band of their previous efforts, and Sam Llanas and Kurt Neumann sound more ambitious as songwriters... Black and White is about using individual problems as analogies to social ones. It's also about loneliness and hardship. It also didn't sell that much better (if any) than the first albums.\\" Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly, however, praised the album and wrote: \\"There's nothing flamboyant or ground-breaking on this fourth album from the BoDeans ‚Äî just hearty, guitar-based rock & roll, fueled by hook- ridden songwriting and achingly lovely harmonies you can feel in your bones. It's a sound well suited to the lyrics on Black and White, which, though haunted by images of loneliness and desperation, are never devoid of courage or hope.

They began setting up a studio in a rented storefront and called upon T-Bone Burnett (producer of their debut album) to work with them once again, this time in an executive producer role. They originally tracked 30 songs live as a full band, but under the advice of their record label, all except for \\"Closer to Free\\" were re-recorded with Kurt Neumann playing most of the instruments himself. The resulting album was more acoustic and laid-back. In 1996, \\"Closer to Free\\" was selected as the theme song to the TV series Party of Five. It was subsequently re-released as a single and became the band's biggest hit.

He is best known for his Craftsman style homes in Pasadena and for the construction of the Casino Ballroom and other homes on Catalina Island in the early 1900s. Renton was influential in the development of Catalina Island under William Wrigley Jr., serving as vice-president of the Santa Catalina Island Company and the Wilmington Transportation Company from 1919 to his retirement in 1936.\\"Renton, David\\" National Encyclopedia of American Biography, 1956. James T. White & Company, 101 Fifth Ave., New York He also served as president of the Wilmington Catalina Airlines from 1931 to 1942. Life David Malcolm \\"DM\\" Renton was born on Prince Edward Island, son of John and Catherine (Nicholson) Renton and one of six children. His father died when he was 14 years old, and Renton left home at the age of 16 to become an apprentice in the construction trade in Massachusetts in 1894.David Malcolm Renton, Autobiography, unpublished In 1902, he moved to Pasadena, California with two friends to establish the building company Upton, Ellsworth & Renton. He later pursued home building on his own as a general contractor. In the early 1900s, California was growing at a rapid rate as westward expansion turned from the gold rush to a real estate boom. The development of railroad and automobile transportation was transforming Southern California into a winter vacation destination. Renton took advantage of the construction boom to make a name for himself. He was recruited in 1919 by gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. to implement resort development plans for Catalina Island on the basis of the quality of work done for Wrigley's private home in Pasadena.Ernst Windle, \\"Autobiography ‚Äì DM Renton and Catalina.\\" Windle's History of Catalina, 1940 edition, page 111. Renton became a trusted employee of Wrigley, who was based in Chicago, and undertook major development projects in real estate development, public works, tourism and local industry, including mining and pottery production. The most significant of these projects are listed below. The massive variety of development on the island also included the construction of a golf course and a spring training camp for the Chicago Cubs, ranching and farming, film and entertainment, an exotic bird park, and more. In order to understand the scope of development in the 1920s, one can compare the count of visitors, which grew by more than a multiple of 8 in one decade. In 1919, the annual visitor count was 90,000 people and in 1930 it had reached 750,000 visitors.William Sanford White. Santa Catalina Island: Its Magic, People, and History. San Dimas, California: White Limited Editions, 1997. Page 57 By the time Wrigley purchased Catalina Island in 1919, he had established a major international business selling gum through the William Wrigley Jr. Co. Through force of his marketing and advertising prowess, Wrigley had amassed a fortune with which he financed the majority of the projects Renton undertook for the company. Major works =Craftsman-style homes, 1902‚Äì1919= As general contractor in southern California, Renton developed residential sub- divisions for the new summer populations moving to California, and included stately homes in both the Craftsman and bungalow courts. He also built homes in the Colonial Revival style. He built homes in Pasadena, Newport Beach, Orange Heights and Long Beach. He is known to have worked as contractor for well-known architectural design firms like Greene & Greene as well as building homes of his own design. * 1080 North Hill Avenue, Pasadena, California * 1415 Michigan Avenue, Pasadena, California built in 1914.http://www.rw2.com/Brochures/1415Michigan.pdf Two bungalow courts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: * Bryan Court at 427 S. Marengo Ave, Pasadena * Bellevue Court on 440 S. Marengo Ave., Pasadena =Mt. Wilson Observatory, 1904= Renton's first major solo job was the construction of the observation tower of the Mt. Wilson Observatory. The tower was built to house a 60-inch telescope for an astronomical observatory. The observatory was a project of the University of Chicago, under the direction of Professor George E. Hale and Professor Edwin Frost. Located at an elevation of 5700 feet on an undeveloped summit, the lumber for the building had to be packed to the mountaintop by mules. Surmounting these logistical challenges, Renton also built housing for astronomers in residence. For the Mt. Wilson Toll Co. he additionally built forty bungalows and a hotel, which was completed in 1904. =Atwater Hotel, Catalina Island, 1920= When William Wrigley Jr. solicited bids for new construction on Catalina Island, Renton was awarded the first contract to build new summer bungalows. Thereafter, Renton was kept on for further development, including the 160-room Atwater Hotel. When Wrigley proposed to have a brand new hotel built in time for the opening of the 1920 summer season, contractors on the mainland did not think it was possible since all materials had to be shipped from the mainland by barge and labor was not readily available. Machinery from Renton's lumber mill was relocated to the island to produce all the required furniture on-site in the spring of 1920. The hotel opened July 1, 1920. The hotel was built in combination with a cafeteria covering an entire city block that could serve 1,500 and was billed as the largest in the world.Newspaper article, Catalina Islander, July 6, 1920 =Mt. Ada, Catalina Island, 1921= After purchasing Catalina Island, William Wrigley Jr. commissioned Renton to design and build another private residence on a hill overlooking the south end of Avalon Bay. The Georgian Colonial home, named after Wrigley's wife and designed according to her ideas, was begun in 1920 and completed in 1921. The home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and is now operated as the \\"Inn at Mount Ada.\\" Walter Harris was a draughtsman for Renton and Nils A. Walberg (1862‚Äì1933) was an artist and decorator for Mt. Ada.\\"Nils Walberg\\" Santa Catalina Island Museum, Biographical Catalog. =Zinc and silver mining, Catalina Island, 1923‚Äì1927= Interested in the possibility of mining on Catalina Island from water well drilling and a brief episode of mining activity there in 1864, Renton established a mine at Blackjack Mountain in 1923. See also Overholt, Alma. The Catalina Story. Avalon: The Island Press, 1971 edition. In 1830, a man named George Yount found gold at Cherry Valley. Mining activities started there in 1864, after the Sutter gold strike began the gold rush in California, and many tunnels were opened in the cove. This activity was ended by Union forces, as the civil war was in progress, who feared the use of the island as a supply for Confederate forces (Overholt, 53). The first ore shipment was sent to smelters with about twenty tons of raw ore containing silver, lead and zinc. During the four years of operations, additional mines were opened up at Pebbly Beach, Renton Vein and Cherry Valley. From February to November 1926, they manufactured and shipped close to 3,000 tons of concentrates and received returns of over $90,000.Sum from figures in private correspondence between DM Renton and William Wrigley Jr. When mining operations were closed due to an international drop in ore prices in 1927, DM had a 100-ton flotation mill in operation at White's Landing, together with aerial cable tramways conveying the ore from the mines to the mill. The mining on Catalina Island under Renton's management was notable for the use of salt water flotation in separating the zinc and silver from the raw ore.\\"Silver Isle Flotation Mill\\" In the 1920s, oil flotation was the standard process for collecting mineral particles from sulfide ore in a liquid slurry.Maurice C. Fuerstenau, Graeme J. Jameson, Roe-Hoan Yoon, Froth Flotation: A Century of Innovation. Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc. (SME): Littleton, Colorado, 2007.Fathi Habashi. \\"A Short history of mineral processing\\" Proceedings of XXIII International Mineral Processing Congress, Volume 1. 2006. In 1921, Perkins demonstrated the effiectiveness of chemical compounds in dealing with sulfide minerals. In 1924, Keller and Lewis showed that water-soluble xanthates are effective. At the time, salt water had not been used in a flotation mill and it had not been shown that organic compounds could be effective floating agents. Although the chemists and engineers consulted had advised that salt water would not work in theory for the flotation mill, with practical application it was discovered that kelp and saltwater organisms furnish potassium iodide needed to successfully separate minerals in a salt water mill. Separating the silver, lead and zinc was further helped by an accidental addition of kerosene and linseed oil which naturally precipitated iron pyrites. Based on their successes, metallurgical and mining engineers came to look at the mining works and examine the quality of concentrates achieved with a salt water flotation system.Private correspondence between DM Renton and William Wrigley Jr., April 6, 1926. =Thompson Dam, Catalina Island, 1924= Developing Catalina Island as a resort meant undertaking a major public works project to find water sources on the island through a system of wells and reservoirs. Prior to 1919, the majority of fresh water on the island was supplied by barge. Water development culminated in 1924 in the construction of a 100,000,000 gallon reservoir, contained by the Thompson Dam, which was connected to supply the town of Avalon via 12 miles of pipeline from the island interior. A major feature of the achievement was the engineering to lay the pipe over a 1460 ft mountain peak. =Catalina Pottery, 1927‚Äì1937= In 1927, Wrigley and Renton decided to construct a tile factory using Catalina clay from the hills that they had analyzed to produce building materials and other fine items. The idea was to meet the demand for roof and enamel tiles in the major construction that was booming in California, in conjunction with the \\"Spanish Mission\\" revival in architecture. Beginning with construction materials to be sold on the mainland, Renton experimented with other products including souvenirs, vases, bookends and figurines. The factory produced trial souvenirs in the intervening years before Catalina Clay Products was founded and expanded the line of offerings in 1930. Using red and white clays found on the island, the products were fired with enamels of local mineral oxides to produce distinctive Catalina colors. A storefront opened in Avalon in the summer of 1930. By 1931, business was promising enough that Renton decided to open branches on the mainland: in both Hollywood and the Mexican style section of Los Angeles known as Olvera Street. Their pottery and signature painted tile and wrought iron tables were picked up by major department stores. A Los Angeles Times article (\\"Ancient Pottery Art Revived\\" December 27, 1931) noted that \\"Avalon-ware is recognizable for its flint-like hardness and beauty of form and color...\\" The business was sold by Philip K. Wrigley to the Gladding, McBean company in 1937. Today, Catalina Pottery is a treasured collectors item.See also Carole Coates, Catalina Island Pottery and Tile: Island Treasures 1927‚Äì1937. Schiffer Publishing, 2001. =Casino Ballroom, Catalina Island, 1929= The Casino Ballroom on Catalina Island is an iconic Art Deco style building. It is distinctive in design with a cantilevered roof for a large circular ballroom without any pillar support. The building was designed by the firm Webber & Spaulding, and Renton managed the construction of the massive $2 million building which began in April 1928 and was completed May 1929.Patricia Ann Moore. The Casino, Avalon Santa Catalina Island California. Avalon: Catalina Island Museum Society, 1979. =Wrigley Memorial, Catalina Island, 1932= Over the two decades they had worked closely together, Wrigley and Renton had formed a close working relationship. Wrigley often referred to Renton as his \\"hands\\" in being trusted to carry out their plans, but they also shared a certain type of energy and enthusiasm for thinking ambitiously and creating something where nothing stood before. Renton's final construction project for his boss was to build the Wrigley Memorial. The plans for the tomb used Catalina materials, flagstone and tiles, in a magnificent 80-ft high resting place that is now a part of the Wrigley Botanical Gardens. =El Encanto, Catalina Island, 1933= As his own independent project, Renton developed the \\"Paseo del Encanto\\" (Promenade of Enchantment), which opened in August 1933. He engaged artists and performances with Se√±ora Consuelo de Bonzo, who owned the Casa de la Golondrina on Olivera street. El Encanto matched a new development program that Wrigley's son (Philip K. Wrigley) and president of the Santa Catalina Island Company had outlined to preserve the atmosphere of old California in Catalina's history and natural ruggedness.Paul M. Angle. Philip K. Wrigley: A Memoir of a Modest Man. Rand McNally: New York, 1975. p 55. Personal life Renton married twice. In 1906 he married Elizabeth Blaisdell Ryder and had two sons: Malcolm Joseph Renton and Arthur Lincoln Renton. His first wife died in 1935 and Renton remarried to Isabel Blanche Cline in 1937. When Renton retired in 1936, he lived at a cattle ranch in Atascadero, California, \\"Rancho Santa Catalina,\\" until he died in 1947. He was a member of the Masonic order (32nd degree, Shriner) and the Scottish Rite Consistory.

It contains features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, canals, dams and stream gages for the United States. Cartographers can link to or download the NHD to use in their computer mapping software. The NHD is used to represent surface water on maps and is also used to perform geospatial analysis. It is a digital vector geospatial dataset designed for use in geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze the flow of water throughout the nation. The dataset represents over 7.5-million miles of streams/rivers and 6.5-million lake/ponds. In mapping, the NHD is used with other data themes such as elevation, boundaries, and transportation to produce general reference maps. In geospatial analysis the NHD is used by scientists using GIS technology. This takes advantage of a flow direction network that can be processed to trace the flow of water downstream. A rich set of attributes used to identify the water features includes an identifier, the official name of the feature, the length or area of the feature, and metadata describing the source of the data. The identifier is used in an addressing system to link specific information about the water such as water discharge, water quality, and fish population. Using the basic water features, flow network, linked information, and other characteristics, it is possible to study cause and effect relationships, such as how a source of poor water quality upstream might affect a fish population downstream. The NHD is part of the United States Geological Survey The National Map for the United States. The NHD is also linked with similar datasets representing the surface water for Canada and Mexico. The dataset primarily maps features a 1:24,000-scale, but in certain areas provides detail at 1:5,000-scale. A version of the NHD called the NHDPlus is integrated with elevation and other landscape data to create detailed drainage catchments and flow volume and velocity estimates for streams and rivers of the U.S. at 1:100,000-scale.

In March 1899 he was transformed into a wealthy man by his discovery of a rich vein of gold ore: He took $30,000 worth of ore from it, and although the Lida Mine, as he called it, was \\"well worth a million dollars\\" he sold it for $100,000 in December 1900. He retained an adjacent mine, which he named Fay. He told a newspaper reporter: \\"Three more days of prospecting would have finished me. I was worn out physically, financially and mentally, when I made the big find, but then, the gold cure is a good one, and now I feel young again.\\" Hamilton was sued by Helen Frick, who claimed she had been a partner in the claim but that he had misled her as to the mine's worth and bought her share for only $500.

Niedt was born in Jena, and enrolled at the University of Jena in 1694, where he is thought to have studied law. Around 1700, he moved to Copenhagen, staying in Hamburg along the way. He died in Copenhagen. The first part of his Musical Guide might be a record of musical techniques similar to what Johann Sebastian Bach used.Niedt p. xiii  Theoretical Works  = The Musical Guide, 1700-1710 = Niedt's Musical Guide consists of three parts, each of which are concerned with figured bass. In the first part, Niedt discusses the basics of figured bass, and gives the following definition: Niedt's suggestion that figured bass is \\"the most complete foundation of music\\" might be misinterpreted if it is read out of context, for later in this same quote, he clarifies that by \\"complete\\" he simply means that the keyboard can play many notes at once, whereas other instruments are limited to one note at a time. The second part of the Musical Guide describes how variation may be introduced in figured bass. Many examples are presented that demonstrate how simple musical materials may be made more complex. Niedt justifies devoting an entire part of his book to variation because, he says, \\"variety in things or ideas ... is to no creature so pleasing and delightful as to the senses and sensibilities of the human soul.\\"Niedt p.73 In addition to variation, the second part of the Musical Guide also contains a specialized dictionary that defines musical terms, as well as a descriptive list of the specifications of 63 important organs found in various places across northern Europe. The third part of the Musical Guide is incomplete, since Niedt died before finishing it. Nonetheless, a substantial portion of the third section was published, which begins by describing counterpoint, and later branches off into other traditionally serious areas of music, such as canon. Niedt is consistently hostile towards what he perceives to be musically pretentious. For example, he has this to say about the sometimes arcane concept of musical mode: Regarding counterpoint, Niedt calls it the musical equivalent of \\"spelling,\\"Niedt p.236 and suggests that counterpoint arises from the realization of figured bass. Niedt insists that \\"mere counterpoint contains no beauty\\" and that one can \\"discern no complete meaning or context\\" from it.Niedt p.237 As opposed to pedagogues who developed rules for composing counterpoint on its own terms (such as Johann Fux), Niedt attempts instead to extend his figured bass instruction to encompass the subject of counterpoint.

Noncitrus trees and shrubs, when they grow by themselves, are not normally attacked by this insect, but they may be when they grow close to heavy infestations on citrus. In Hawaii, such trees as mango, avocado, pink tecoma, and surinam cherry have hosted colonies. Lifecycle Nymphs hatching from eggs Pupae and eggs The female blackfly lays batches of eggs in a spiral pattern on the undersides of leaves. The eggs are golden-brown, but darken before hatching, which happens in seven to 10 days.Dowell RV, Cherry RH, Fitzpatrick GE, Reinert JA, Knapp JL. 1981. Biology, plant-insect relations, and control of the citrus blackfly. Florida Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 818: 1-48. The nymph moults three times. The first instar is a brown, elongated oval shape, about 0.30 mm long with two transparent filaments curling back over the body. The second instar is a darker brown and has short spines on its body. It measures about 0.40 mm long. The third instar is glossy black with many stout spines and measures about 0.87 mm long by 0.74 mm wide. The larval stages last three to 9 weeks. The pupa is ovate and black, with short bristles and a marginal fringe of waxy secretion. The adult, when it first emerges, has a pale-yellow head, whitish legs and reddish-brown eyes. Soon afterwards, it darkens, developing a fine covering of waxy powder which gives it a slate-blue appearance. The wings are angled and held in a tented fashion. The whole lifecycle takes from 45 to 130 days, depending largely on the temperature. Damage The principal harm done by the citrus blackfly is the sucking of the tree's sap, which deprives it of both water and nutrients. The excretion of honeydew coats the leaf surfaces and encourages the growth of sooty mold. This can severely impair both leaf respiration and photosynthesis. The combination of all these factors causes a decline in the health and vigour of the tree and a reduction in fruit yield. Management The citrus blackfly has a number of natural enemies. The most effective agents for controlling it in Florida are the parasitic wasps, Encarsia perplexaHuang J, Polaszek A. 1998.

Population density of the citrus blackfly, Aleurocanthus woglumi Ashby (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), and its parasites in urban Florida in 1979-81. Environmental Entomology 12: 878-884. These species have been used in biological control of the pest. For example, both species were introduced into Hawaii in 1999 after discovery of the presence of the citrus blackfly the previous year. Both wasps have succeeded in establishing themselves and are helping to reduce the damage done by the pest. The use of insecticides may help to control infestations temporarily, but this is not advised because of the adverse effects on the environment and any existing predators. The application of an oil emulsion may be effective and less toxic. A sufficiency of water and appropriate applications of fertiliser will encourage growth and minimise damage.

It is designed to teach high school students and general interest groups about the history of biology the role of a research assistant given the task of a solving a series of puzzles and clues left by a scientist, Dr. Walden Shyre, who has mysteriously disappeared. The puzzles that players solve are connected by a story line that progresses through a series of emails that are displayed once the player has solved a mission. There are 14 missions with one or two puzzles to solve in each mission. Players investigate objects within the game to find clues or uncover the answer by surfing real and fictitious web sites. Users explore pivotal discoveries that laid the foundation of our current understanding of biology.The History of Biology‚Ñ¢: Examining a Digital Game for Improving Students' Nature of Science Conceptions and Promoting Student Engagement in Biology The purpose of the game is to teach the discoveries and research of over 20 scientists, as the missions are completed. For instance, in the first mission called, \\"The Art of Imitation\\", players learn about Zacharias Janssen, who is credited with inventing the compound microscope. The scientists highlighted in this game are: Anthonie Van Leewenhoek, Robert Hooke, Matthias Schleiden, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow, Carl Linnaeus, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Gregor Mendel, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Johannes Friedrich Mieschner, Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, Maclyn McCarty, Alfred Hershey, Martha Chase, James D.Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, Fredrick Sanger, and Kary Mullis. Screenshot of Mission 1 The Art of Imitation Screenshot of the RNA Gallery web site Various scientific discoveries from the 15th century through to the 21st century are dealt with in this game. Cell theory is explored by analyzing letters and a stamp. Finding the answer to this clue means researching terms such as metabolism, nerve cells and pepsin. To introduce mechanisms of diversity and the work of Charles Darwin, players explore maps, find GPS coordinates and read about Darwin's research with finches. The clues in each mission are randomized so every player has a different path to determine the solution; although the overall mission is the same for everyone. This allows for players to use a variety of methods to complete a mission and move on to the next level. This game provides an interactive way to learn about historical events in biology. Rewards As players complete each mission, they are sent a victory email from one of the game characters. This email usually contains a teaser about what the next mission will entail. Additional educational features A notepad is visible in all missions to make notes along the way, create a progress journal and ask questions. Supportive features for teachers The notepad feature in History of Biology, which is visible to teachers, allows the teacher to answer questions or deal with specific content students may be interested in or struggling with, in class. Also for the teacher, is a detailed teacher's guide with a walk through of each mission.

It believes in a just and sustainable society where citizens are empowered to protect the environment and environmental protection is enshrined in law. It fulfills its mission in a variety of ways. First, it works to shape existing and future environmental policies in British Columbia and in Canada. Work in this area spans a variety of topics including green communities, climate change, energy, forests and land use, aboriginal law and environmental assessment. Second, it provides free legal advice regarding environmental issues, and it provides grants, through its Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund, to individuals or groups who need to hire legal representation to resolve an environmental conflict.Comox Valley Echo - Environmental Law Fund celebrates 20 years Third, it tracks and analyzes developments in British Columbian and Canadian environmental policy, and distributes this information to the public, through its Environmental Law Alert Blog, monthly Legal E-Brief newsletter, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. History West Coast Environmental Law was founded in 1974 and is the oldest environmental law organization in British Columbia, Canada. It was established to promote the cause of environmental law reform and to empower citizens so that they could work together to bring about progressive change. For much of its history, it has been engaged directly in law reform, legal education and test case litigation. In the late 1980s it was determined that a stand-alone environmental law organization, which would devote itself primarily to test case litigation, was required. As a result, West Coast Environmental Law played an active role in the establishment of Sierra Legal Defence Fund, now known as Ecojustice Canada, to take the lead in using test litigation to defend and protect the environment. West Coast Environmental Law, in turn, narrowed its focus to drafting and advancing legislative reform initiatives and providing public legal education. From 1990 to present West Coast Environmental Law and Ecojustice Canada have avoided duplication by cooperating and coordinating on areas of potential overlap and having distinct market niches. Notable achievements West Coast Environmental Law has a lengthy and successful history of influence on environmental legislative reform in British Columbia and in Canada. It has helped establish and shape many significant environmental legislative initiatives. Some of its notable achievements include: * Playing a role in the development of several key environmental laws, including the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. * Representing the Peace Valley Environmental Association at hearings on the controversial Site C dam. * Working, as part of a delegation, to help negotiate the Kyoto Protocol. * Negotiated the amendments that resulted in the protection the Great Bear Rainforest. * Helping to draft the \\"good wood\\" certification standard for British Columbia, which independently verifies that wood products come from forests that are managed in an ecologically and socially responsible way. Areas of work West Coast Environmental Law works to ensure that progressive, stringent environmental laws are created and enforced. It currently specializes in areas dealing with Green Communities, Climate Change, Energy, Forests and Land Use, Aboriginal Law and Environmental Assessment. ;Green communities: Work in this area is focused on reducing urban impacts, strengthening local government environmental by-laws, policies and practices, and advancing community livability and sustainability through strategic use of the law and law reform. ;Climate change: Work in this area is focused on creating a legislative framework that will allow British Columbia and Canada to do its part to protect and sustain the Earth's atmosphere. ;Energy: Work in this area is focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by working on projects that shift us away from on our reliance on fossil fuels and towards sustainable renewable energy sources. ;Forests and land use: Work in this area is focused on transforming the way rights and responsibilities about land use are understood in British Columbia ‚Äìcreating new legal mechanisms for resource tenures (licenses) and land use decision-making that are more democratic, sustainable and just. ;Aboriginal law: Work in this area is focused on providing legal and strategic advice to First Nations and First Nations political organizations including crafting law reform solutions that address Aboriginal Title and Rights and foster ecological and cultural sustainability. ;Environmental assessment: Work in this area focuses on law and policy reform discussions at both the federal and provincial levels, and work on a number of fronts to advance its law reform objectives. Environmental legal aid West Coast Environmental Law provides legal information or advice to members of the public who are facing an environmental problem. In some cases, it will provide brief legal opinions or letters where doing so has the potential to achieve an important environmental result. Some examples of successes as a result of this service include; an environmental assessment on a major resort was put on hold to allow better information to be collected; a public advisory committee was put in place to examine concerns about a highway project; a medical health officer recommended changes to Vancouver's bylaws dealing with wood smoke; and a municipal proposal to build a road through a park was dropped. Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund West Coast Environmental Law provides grants, through its Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund, to individuals or groups who need to hire legal representation to resolve an environmental problem. The Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund is the only source of environmental legal aid in British Columbia and is used to hire lawyers, at a legal aid rate. The grants have allowed recipients to obtain legal advice on a wide range of issues; pursue alternative dispute resolutions; appear before government tribunals; participate in environmental assessments and challenge government decisions in court. Since 1989, when the Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund was established, it has provided over $4 million in grants, which have helped support and resolve more than 500 legal cases in British Columbia. In one such case marine biologist and fish farm activist, Alexandra Morton, used funding from West Coast Environmental Law, to successful challenge the constitutionality of allowing fish farms in British Columbia.Comox Valley Echo - Environmental Law Fund celebrates 20 years In another such case, a group of citizens known as Coal Watch, used funding from West Coast Environmental Law, to oppose a proposed coal mine located in Baynes Sound in Vancouver Island. Environmental Law Alert Blog, Legal E-Brief Newsletter, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube West Coast Environmental Law tracks and analyzes developments in British Columbian and Canadian environmental policy, and distributes this information to the public, through its Environmental Law Alert Blog, monthly Legal E-Brief newsletter, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. Specifically, it comments on proposed changes to the law that will weaken, or strengthen, environmental protection; stories and situations where existing environmental laws are failing to protect the environment; and emerging legal strategies that could be used to protect the environment. By doing so it helps ensure that citizens hear both sides on controversial issues and policies. In the news West Coast Environmental Law is recognized as being the trusted authority on environmental policy, legislation and regulation in British Columbia. Staff lawyers are regularly quoted by the media commenting on environmental issues in the news. Recently, staff lawyer Andrew Gage was quoted in the Victoria Times Colonist, commenting on the state of enforcement of environmental laws in British Columbia \\"The result is less protection for B.C.'s environment, we're talking about toxins going into the environment, we're talking about people's health, which is at stake if they can't enforce these laws.\\".Victoria Times Colonist - Pollution convictions dropping, watchdog says Staff lawyer Josh Paterson, was also recently quoted in the Globe and Mail, commenting on the need for a legislative ban on oil tankers sailing off of the coast of British Columbia \\"We have a world-class coast that needs strong, legal protection from the threat of oil spills ‚Äì whether from Enbridge or any other project. We're going to keep working toward a legislated ban.\\".

The East India Company initially traded with Japan. British ships used for transportation mostly sailed in Chinese waters. It led to the rapid development of trade between the company and China. As the same time, there was growing of the trading ships pass the Hong Kong seaport. The merchant fleets were usually composed by sailors from Pakistan. In 1829, the trade reached its peak and the gate for the early Muslims settling down in Hong Kong had been opened since then. The early seamen mostly came from the shores of Malabar (India), Bay of Bengal, Hazara (Abbottabad), Lahore, Gujarat and Campbellpur (Attock) in Pakistan. With Hong Kong beginning to develop into an important seaport for the British, more and more Pakistani seamen and garrisons were passing through and some settled here.The Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong.

During the early 19th century, Pakistani lived together with the other Muslim seamen. They had no proper accommodation or dormitory but somehow they managed to stay well-knitted together in an area known as Lower Lascar Row - in the Central area, better known to the Hong Kong old timers as \\"Moro Kai\\". \\"Moro Kai\\" was where they lived and their social practices such as Jamat (gathering) took place. They also started their business so they had their shops. Though they vacated their shops and residents years later, they had formed their community. As there were more Muslim garrisons stationing in Hong Kong later on, they began to form bodies to represent the various sections of the Muslim Society. And of course, Pakistanis were included.The Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong. How Muslims set foot to Hong Kong. Light of Islam.

In the current application system of public rental housing, a lack of language support and channel resulted that most Pakistanis not knowing how to apply for the rental housing, and also, some of them believed that they are not qualified for applying public housing, although some of them are eligible to do so. For those Pakistanis who lived in private housing, they had the experience that their nationality was frequently inquired by property owners and property agencies.

However, it is a different picture for immigrants from Pakistan. It is difficult for immigrant Pakistanis to get jobs in Hong Kong mostly because of language. Besides, education levels, their identity as Pakistani, cultural and religious difference are also obstacles.

He was a frequently published author and columnist as well as a respected photographer. He served as senior scientist to the National Geographic Society from 1958 to 1975. Life and career Zahl was an honors graduate of North Central College in Illinois, received his doctorate in experimental biology from Harvard University in 1936, and immediately became notable in cancer research at Haskins Laboratories. However, he became increasingly interested in natural history. In 1939, Zahl wrote his first book, \\"To the Lost World\\", about a trip he took to Mt. Roraima in Venezuela. This interest led to research at New York's Museum of Natural History, and Zahl published \\"Blindness: Modern Approaches to the Unseen Environment\\" (1950), \\"Flamingo Hunt\\" (1952), and \\"Coro-Coro: World of the Scarlet Ibis\\" (1954). In the 1950s, Zahl began to concentrate on his writing and photography career with National Geographic, serving as senior scientist of natural history for the National Geographic Society from 1958 to 1975. He always chose his subject matter rather than having it assigned, and all article photography was taken by him personally. His subject matters included coral reefs, volcanoes, giant frogs, carnivorous plants, seahorses, scorpions, man-of-war jellyfish, piranhas, hatchetfish, butterflies, and slime molds. Zahl discovered the tallest redwood tree known at the time in the mid-sixties, which made the magazine's cover. Zahl also photographed the world's first known albino gorilla in Africa. Zahl was married and had two children. At least sixteen of his articles included the entire Zahl family as they went off on adventurous vacations exploring the natural world. Up until 1959, the covers of the magazine had the famous yellow border and the black-on-white table of contents, but no photography. When photos were added, Mrs. Eda Zahl was the first human being to grace the cover of the magazine, wearing diving apparatus. Between expeditions, Zahl did research for the National Cancer Institute, the National Science Foundation and the Atomic Energy Commission. During World War II, Zahl served with the Office of Science Research and Development, then resumed his explorations after the war. His articles also appeared in Atlantic Magazine, Scientific American, Scientific Monthly, and in the 1960s he wrote a column for The American Scholar. He won many awards for photography and some of his work is on permanent display in New York's Museum of Modern Art. Zahl wrote more articles for National Geographic than anyone else in its long history, over fifty articles from 1949 to 1978.

It is located next to the River Hill village in the town of Columbia, Maryland, in the United States. The MPEA was created in 1996 for educational, research, and recreational purposes. History The Middle Patuxent River had become silt clogged from farm runoff killing off some fish species habitat. By the 1980s construction activity for the planned community of Columbia caused water quality to reach its lowest levels. In 1991, The Rouse Company proposed the sale of the environmentally sensitive undeveloped land valued at $1.9 million to a Rouse managed trust paid for by Howard County for $2.2 Million. In 1993, students raised $16,000 to save the 1864 Pfieffers Corner schoolhouse from demolition on its Elkridge site. The County Planning director Joseph Rutter, pushed for a rapid purchase of the Rouse property to allow for the school to be relocated to the new MPEA. After the property was purchased, the county choose a separate site in Elkridge for the school relocation. In 1996, Program Open Space grant money was used to purchase of land from the Rouse related developer of Columbia, Howard Research and Development. After the sale, HRD was still able to count the acreage towards its Columbia open space requirements. $1.76 million was donated by HRD to form the Middle Patuxent Environmental Foundation to manage the park. In 1999, The Columbia development arm of the Rouse company, Howard Research and Development sold 31 acres or the environmental area to the adjacent W.R. Grace company. In 2014, an adjoining W.R Grace parcel zoned planned employment center was combined using a new \\"community enhancement floating\\" district overlay developed by the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning to convert the commercially zoned property into a 180-unit residential development occupying a portion of the original environmental area. The planning board unanimously approved the project which resides in a school district requiring the highest amount of portable classrooms in the county to mitigate overcrowding. Council member Mary Kay Sigaty was quoted saying \\"The Community Enhanced Floating District\\" has given the public access to one of the treasures we do have in the county\\". In 2007, a study determined that the Patuxent River was \\"fair to poor biological conditions and only partial support of habitat conditions\\" from runoff related to development in the Hobbit's Glen area. The Middle Patuxent Environmental Foundation was formed to study the issue in 2015 with a $38,000 Watershed Assistance Grant Program. The MPEA is home to over 40 species of mammals, and numerous amphibians, reptiles, fishes, butterflies, plants and other wildlife.

He enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he studied piano with Carl Baermann (1839‚Äì1913), a friend and pupil of Franz Liszt. In Boston Maier met Lee Pattison (1890‚Äì1966), a recent New England Conservatory graduate who was also a fine pianist. Following Maier‚Äôs graduation in 1913, Maier and Pattison left together for Europe, where they hoped to become pupils of Harold Bauer (1873‚Äì1951), Josef Hofmann (1876‚Äì1957), or Arthur Schnabel (1882‚Äì1951), all eminent pianists of the time. They found that Bauer was away and Hofmann took no pupils, but Schnabel agreed to teach them. So they went to Berlin, where Schnabel coached them for about a year.‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòPiano Twins‚Äô Tell How They Do It,‚Äù The Musician, March 1926, 11.

Villari (a former black belt student of Nick Cerio and William Kwai Sun Chow),Ayoob, Massad. \\"Fred Villari Markets the Martial Arts\\". Black Belt Magazine, July 1975. who devised a hybrid system which integrated the four ways of fighting: striking, kicking, felling, and grappling to eliminate the inherent weakness of martial arts systems that focus on just one or two of fighting techniques. Shaolin Kenpo Karate is primarily taught through a chain of Villari's Martial Arts Centers in the United States and Canada, although there are several unaffiliated organizations that teach variations of the style. These include schools founded by former students of Fred Villari. History & Development The roots of Shaolin Kenpo Karate can be traced back to three main sources of Asian martial arts: # The Shaolin Temple where Kung Fu and other Chinese martial arts are commonly referred to as \\"boxing\\" or \\"temple boxing\\".ZhƒÅng K«íngzhƒÅo ÂºµÂ≠îÊò≠ (c. 1784) (in Chinese).

China Review International 6 (2): 319‚Äì332. . ISSN 1069-5834 The Chinese aspect of the art is also the source of the 5 basic animal forms: Tiger, Crane, Snake, Leopard, and Dragon which all have very different postures and focuses. # The Yoshida and Komatsu clans of Japan who founded the system of Kenp≈ç. James Mitose was a member of the Yoshida family, and is commonly credited as the founder of modern Kenpo/Kempo.Rathbone, Jim. \\"James Mitose and the Path of Kenpo\\" 2006 White Tiger Productions. p.14-15 # Mongolian, Chinese & Tibetan wrestling from which most Asian grappling arts (such as Chin Na and Jujutsu) descended. Because of the diversity of Asian, Polynesian, and American culture in Hawaii, the arts of Kenpo, Kajukenbo (which was an early hybrid martial art), and Kenpo Karate were formulated mostly by street fighters like William Chow and Adriano Emperado. Ed Parker helped bring Kenpo to mainstream America through his work in Hollywood and with celebrities such as Elvis Presley and Bruce Lee. Through later work of George Pesare and Nick Cerio, Kenpo was brought to the East Coast of the United States,Cerio, Nick. \\"Nick Cerio's Kenpo - The Master's Text\\" Publisher: Nick Cerios Kenpo (July 1997). where Cerio would meet and train Villari. Villari's use of Kenpo, which he later changed to \\"Kempo,\\" would be the vehicle by which he would bind together the principles of the traditional martial arts: > Villari's martial arts training started early in his life. After being > introduced to Western and Chinese boxing by his father, Villari went on to > study jiujitsu and wrestling with the LeBlanc brothers in his middle teens. > By the time he was 18, Villari realized his martial arts training was > stagnating and sought out Nick Cerio as an instructor of Chinese kenpo. > After completing his requirements as second degree black belt with Cerio, > Villari traveled to the West Indies where he traded his techniques for > karate and kung-fu training. While in the islands, Villari also studied > under a Chinese-Australian instructor Soo, and gained his third and fourth > degrees. After working with another master Len Chou, Villari received his > fifth degree and soon decided to open his own school. The original Shaolin Kenpo Karate school was United Studios of Self Defense, later becoming Fred Villari's Studio of Self Defense. It was under this name that the SKK style spread across the United States and throughout the world. At its peak, there were more than 300 Villari franchised martial arts schools worldwide. The development of the system consisted mainly of mastering several existing martial arts, removing movements Villari deemed inefficient, and then integrating the remaining movements into a cohesive system. Fred Villari borrowed heavily from the following in the development of SKK: # Shaolin Kung Fu is the \\"backbone\\" of SKK for its circular punches and kicks, but mainly for the incorporation of the 5 animals: Tiger, Crane, Dragon, Snake, and Leopard. Shaolin arts also emphasize a sense of balance and a lifestyle of health and fitness. Shaolin animal strikes and methods used by Villari are included more prominently in the higher ranks of SKK and are thus less apparent to a casual observer or low ranking student. # Karate for its mechanical style as well as linear and angular movements combined with quick shuffles and explosive attacks. Nearly everything taught in the first three levels of SKK is rooted in traditional Karate, which had led to much of the criticism of the system using the term \\"Shaolin\\" when the casual observer or young student would be learning little else but Karate stances, strikes, and blocking methods until they have achieved the rank of purple belt. # Kenp≈ç for its non-dogmatic approach to fighting systems and a mixture of both hard and soft movements that blend nicely in combinations. Kempo is taught slowly to beginners in SKK, but is increasingly prevalent in intermediate, advanced, and master levels of the system. It is also a noticeable source of many black belt forms in SKK. # Chin Na, Jujutsu, & Mongolian wrestling for their varying focuses on different aspects of holding, seizing, locking, throwing, felling and delivering pain that can be controlled. Aside from use of specific and traceable Asian lineage, a wealth of material was created by Fred Villari himself, and still further material was \\"Demystified\\" for the sake of being shared with the masses. From this breadth of source material and original work by Villari, Shaolin Kempo Karate was codified to include 108 fighting combinations and the following katas: Two Man Fist Set, Sho Tun Kwok, 12 Hands of the Tiger, Nengli South, Nengli North, 11 Hands of Buddha, Invincible Wall, Branches of the Falling Pine, Lost Leopard, Iron Fortress, Tai Sing Mon, 1000 Buddhas, Five Dragons Face the Four Winds, Sneaky Snake, Sad Snails, Wounded Tigers, Immortal Monkey and the Plum Tree Blocking System. Four Ways of Fighting Shaolin Kempo Karate is built on the notion that all martial arts styles can be characterized as using one or more of the \\"four ways of fighting\\" #Striking: to use of any part of the arms (e.g. open or closed hand, elbows, or forearms) #Kicking: to use of any part of the leg (e.g. foot, shin, or knee) #Felling: to knock an opponent off his feet (e.g. by throwing, pulling, or shoving) #Grappling: to clutch or grip (e.g. wrestling, holding, or locking joints). Belts: White, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Blue, Blue/Green, Green, Green/Brown, Brown (With various degrees.), Black (With various degrees.), Master Belt (Black with red stripes.) Shaolin Kenpo Karate has eleven belt ranks (excluding dan ranks). New students begin at white belt and progress as they demonstrate requisite proficiency. Ranks are represented by the color of belt worn. In addition, there are also multiple midterms for belts purple and above. Belts are given every two months from white to green, 4 months for green to brown, and 6 months for black belt ranks. The grading in Shaolin Kenpo Karate consists mainly in the demonstration of techniques, combinations, and forms as well as application of knowledge in sparring. In addition, students are placed in various situations that will help them develop a stronger and more logical mind in simulated self-defense scenarios. Forms consist of a display of footwork with kicks and punches as well as displacements. Controversies Largely due to the both rapid growth of his chain of martial arts schools and claims Villari had made regarding his codification of an \\"unbeatable\\" fighting system, Villari and his business have been the subject of criticism in the martial arts community. Most typically, this came from practitioners of the highly traditional forms of Kung Fu and Karate who claimed that Villari did not have the authorization to modify existing systems or tamper with very specific and traditional forms, katas, stances, and styles. Among the most frequent criticism of Villari is his alleged self-promotion to 10th degree in the later 1980's, then later to 15th degree (by 7 of the highest ranking master black belts in Shaolin Kempo Karate), Villari justifies this elevation by highlighting the creation of a new, unique martial arts system, with new techniques and combinations which had not previously existed. However, a few members of the traditional martial arts communities felt that Villari lacked the authorization necessary to be considered a Grandmaster, but among The Shaolin Kenpo and Kempo communities he is considered one of the greatest Grandmasters of all time. Another frequently criticized aspect of the Villari business organization is the ability of \\"distance learning\\", in which students are able to learn ranks through black belt by purchasing a series of DVDs and then filming themselves performing the techniques. Villari claims that one of the key reasons for online or DVD training is to reach the masses where martial arts or Shaolin Kempo Karate do not exist. See also * G. D.

Mr. Levy would create moves on the dance floor and then teach others how to do them. Dancehall moves are notable for characteristically suggestive and sensual movements of the hips and rolling of the body. Even though these dance styles quickly became popular in Jamaica, not until the 1990s was the new dancehall style of reggae music welcomed worldwide. Levy helped the crossover to dancing by making up the exotic moves that he was later known for. This dancehall music grew to incorporate new beats and sounds like electronic music and sampling. This new style of reggae often included a DJ rapping and singing to up-tempo rhythms.Bradley, Lloyd. This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaica's Music. New York:Grove Press, 2001.

The committee is headed by Rufat Aslanli. History Establishment of securities market in Azerbaijan dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In the first decades of the century, banks in Baku issued promissory notes and interest bearing securities which were used during sale transactions and as a form of IOUs. Usage of promissory notes was widely developed during the existence of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The first shares in the country were issued by the Baku Trade Bank. Among the main shareholders of the bank were the chairman of board of directors, Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, Shamsi Asadullayev, Musa Naghiyev, Murtuza Mukhtarov and others. After establishment of Soviet rule in Azerbaijan, the usage of notes was banned. With restoration of independence of Azerbaijan, establishment of securities market was one of the main priorities of the government. On July 26, 1999 Presidential Decree on \\"On Providing the Activity of State Committee for Securities under the auspices of the President of Azerbaijan Republic\\" formally established an agency under the office of the President of Azerbaijan overseeing organized securities market in the country. Since the inception, the committee has undertaken several important reforms on transparency of processing the security markets, adopted acts restricting potential risks in the markets to the minimal level, protecting rights of investors to comply with international standards. On February 15, 2000 the committee supported establishment of Baku Stock Exchange (BSE). Baku Stock Exchange is made up from 18 big banks and financial institutions, with Istanbul Stock Exchange being among them.

Created in 1989, the monument depicts three letter carriers and was commissioned in celebration of the centennial of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). Description and history The bronze sculpture depicts three figures representing letter carriers from across NALC's history: A white man with a mustache wearing a turn of the 20th century uniform (with an inscription on the jacket reading \\"Offner '89\\"); an African American man wearing a 1939 uniform (from the time of NALC's fiftieth anniversary); and a woman in a contemporary uniform. The sculpture is set on a black granite base, with the north and south faces of the base reading: \\"In honor of the men and women/ who have delivered for America/ in rain, sleet, and snow./ And in tribute to their Union,/ the National Association of Letter Carriers,/ founded across Plankinton Avenue/ from this site on August 30, 1889./ Dedicated August 30, 1989.\\" The monument measures 66 x 67 x 56 inches, and was created in 1989. The sculpture is a tribute to the National Association of Letter Carriers, commissioned to celebrate the centennial of its founding. The group's history began when the United States Postal Service gave employment preference to veterans after the American Civil War. As a result, there were many veterans employed by the Postal Service across the United States. After the Postal Service administration refused to recognize the eight-hour day, a group of veteran Milwaukee postal workers organized 60 postal worker veterans from 18 states who met in a tavern on Plankinton Avenue (the building, now used for storage by Renaissance Books, formerly housed the headquarters of Manpower Inc.) on August 30, 1889, immediately following the national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic in Milwaukee. The postal workers agreed to form the National Association of Letter Carriers, demanding an eight-hour work day, a higher pay scale, a pension plan, and service stripes for every four years of service.Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook, p. 42. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison Elliot Offner was commissioned through the Franz Bader Gallery in New York to create the monument. He built the maquette in Cambridge, England while he was there as a visiting artist. He then worked with the Tallix Foundry in Beacon, New York to cast the sculpture. The work was sent to Milwaukee by truck from New York. Centennial celebrations lasted four days and included a parade, exhibits and the dedication of the monument by Vincent R. Sombrotto, NALC's president. More than four thousand letter carriers and their families attended the festivities. The U.S. Postal Service issued a postage stamp (designed by Jack Davis) depicting three contemporary letter carriers, to commemorate the centennial day. Buck and Palmer's 1995 Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook observes: \\"The downtown Milwaukee site of the monument is correct in a historical sense, but unsuccessful in its public presence. Site considerations for the monument were overlooked and it stands on the small crowded triangle with annoying awkwardness.\\" Postman Square / Postman's Porch In 2016, the small triangular pocket park around the statue, known as Postman Square, was improved with new furniture to encourage lunch hour visitors. In 2019, the space was improved again and re-christened Postman's Porch. The space was redesigned to become more open by removing hedges and adding additional plaza space. Reading materials, tables and chairs and festive banners were also added. A series of concerts were held to create a spirit of community gathering.

It devastated the Richmond Theatre, located on the north side of Broad Street between what is now Twelfth and College Streets. The fire, which killed 72 people including many government officials, was the worst urban disaster in American history at the time. The Monumental Church was erected on the site as a memorial to the fire. Background A previous building at the same location was known initially as the first Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences in America, and subsequently the site was known as \\"The Theatre Square.\\" Chevalier Quesnay de Beaurepaire, a French officer who served in the American Revolutionary War, had developed the idea for the academy but the plan was abandoned due to the war. Richmond's first theatre, a barn-like building, opened its doors on October 10, 1786 for the first time with a performance of School for Scandal. The Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788 was held in this building beginning on June 3 for three weeks \\"after first convening in the temporary capitol at Cary and fourteenth streets.\\"Richmond Times Dispatch, \\"Monumental Church to Observe 150th Anniversary of First Service.\\" May 3, 1964. Among the many individuals in attendance were James Madison, John Marshall, James Monroe, Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, George Nicholas, Edmund Randolph, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and Patrick Henry. This building was destroyed by fire in 1811.Weddell, Alexander Willbourne. Southern Churchman, January 9, 1932. A new multi-story brick theatre was erected around 1810 on what was at the time the north side of H Street (now Broad). There was an orchestra section, a first balcony, and an upper balcony, with narrow doorways. Fire The performance on the evening of December 26, 1811 at the Richmond Theatre was a benefit for Alexander Placide and his daughter. The program was a double billing: first, a play entitled The Father, or Family Feuds, and after it, a pantomime entitled Raymond and Agness, or The Bleeding Nun. The benefit originally had been scheduled for December 23, but was postponed due to the death of one of the company's players, Eliza Poe, as well as Placide's own illness and foul weather. It being Christmas time and the last opening of the season, the auditorium on December 26 was packed with an excited audience of 598 people, with 518 adults and 80 children to view the pantomime, which commenced immediately after the play was finished. The fire started after the curtain fell following the first act of the pantomime, when the chandelier was lifted toward the ceiling with the flame still lit. The lamp became entangled in the cords used to lift the chandelier and it touched one of the items used in the front scenes, which caught fire. As soon as the boy worker who was operating the cords saw the flames, he fled the building. The flames rose up the scenery and spread from one hanging scene to the other; there were 35 such hanging scenes which could be lowered. In addition to the hangings were also the borders that provided the outlines of buildings and skies, among other set pieces; these, too, caught fire sequentially. Pine planks (with shingles over them) fixed over rafters with no plastering and ceiling spread the flames, which fell from the ceiling and spread extremely rapidly. The impact of the fire was worsened because the stage curtain hid the initial flames from the audience. The theatre had multiple exits: a little known side-door was used by those in the orchestra and back stage while an upper balcony exit was a clear way out. In the panic of the fire, many people were pushed and fell, and they were unable to escape. Many people jumped out of the windows of the theatre. Others who were assembled near the window were afraid to do so. The editor of the Richmond Standard, present at the scene, urged people to jump; he, with help from many others on the ground, then heroically saved the lives of many of those who chose to do so. Gilbert Hunt, who helped save numerous lives on the night of the fire, became the subject of a biography published to provide an income for him during his old age Also credited with helping save lives was Gilbert Hunt, a former slave who, having purchased his freedom, was working as a blacksmith at a shop near the theatre. Along with Dr. James McCaw, a physician who was attending the theatre that evening, Hunt was credited with saving close to a dozen people. McCaw would lower them from the burning second story, and Hunt would catch them. Hunt also saved McCaw, who jumped just as a burning section of wall was about to fall on him. Today Hunt is memorialized by a historical marker on the site. A book, entitled Gilbert Hunt, the City Blacksmith, later was published in his honor and to provide financial assistance for him in his old age. It has been claimed that Peter Francisco saved over thirty people from the theater during the fire, having been in attendance at the performance. =Victims= Of the 72 who died in the fire, 54 were women and 18 were men. Among the victims were Virginia's sitting governor, George William Smith, and former U.S. Senator Abraham B. Venable; the governor had purportedly tried to save his child from the flames. Also killed were Benjamin Botts, of Dumfries, and his wife; Botts had made a name for himself as a member of the defense in Aaron Burr's 1807 trial for treason. Their son, John Botts became a U.S. Congressman and prominent unionist during the American Civil War. Dr. Robert Greenhow, later the husband of noted spy Rose Greenhow, survived the fire along with his father; his mother was killed in the blaze. Another survivor was former representative John G. Jackson, then serving in the Virginia General Assembly. George Tucker, who became the University of Virginia's first Professor of Moral Philosophy, narrowly escaped with his life, after being struck in the head by a timber which left a permanent scar. In his autobiography, Tucker claimed to have saved several women from the conflagration.Fieser, p.52. Sarah Henry Campbell, daughter of Patrick Henry, was rescued from the flames by Alexander Scott, and later became his wife. Many members of the upper echelons of Richmond society were in attendance on the night of the fire, and many were killed; among the dead were listed Pages, Nelsons, and Braxtons, all members of some of the First Families of Virginia. Aftermath On December 27, 1811, the Common Council commissioned a Committee of Investigation, which absolved the Placide & Green Theater Company of responsibility and blamed the inferior design and construction of the theater for the great loss of life.\\"Report of the Committee of Investigation,\\" Richmond Enquirer, December 31, 1811. Quoted in Baker, Meredith Henne. The Richmond Theater Fire: Early America's First Great Disaster. LSU Press, 2012. =Monumental Church= Monumental Church was built on the site of the destroyed theatre to commemorate the victims of the fire The ordinance for building the monument for the victims was further modified by a resolution of the Richmond city council to erect a church at the site, as a further commemoration of the victims of the fire. City Council also sanctioned an amount of US $5000 as its contribution toward the building of the church by the 'Association for building a church on Shockoe Hill\\". Thus the Monumental Church was built on the Richmond Theatre site between 1812 and 1814 to commemorate those who had died from the fire. The Episcopal church was commissioned by U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall. It was designed by architect Robert Mills, the only pupil of Thomas Jefferson; Mills was also the architect of the Washington Monument and White House of the Confederacy. Mills \\"had a reputation for being particularly concerned with fireproofing,\\"Robert Russell, College of Charleston Department of Historic Preservation probably owing to his work on Monumental, and later in his career designed Charleston's Fireproof Building as a testament to that fact. The church was built in an octagonal shape. The marble monument in the form of an urn erected at the church contains the names of 72 victims of the fire, inscribed on its four cardinal faces. The monument is enclosed within a wire fence. It is located in the central yard of the memorial church, in the middle of the church's front or main portico. The remains of the dead lie in a crypt below the portico. On the monument, the names of the male victims face Broad Street, and the female victims' names appear on the remaining three sides. Six of the known victims were black, including at least one slave. Their six names are carved below the names of the sixty-six white victims on the monument's base.Baker, Meredith Henne. The Richmond Theater Fire: Early America's First Great Disaster. LSU Press, 2012. Although the monument lists only 72 victims, at least 76 were known to have died in the blaze or in the days immediately following the disaster.\\"Victims & Survivors List\\", http://www.theaterfirebook.com/notlaunched/?page_id=11 , retrieved 2011-11-24, author Meredith Henne Baker Monumental Church established the first Sunday School program in Richmond on November 20, 1817.Evans, Mrs. Wm. E., \\"The History of the Monumental Church,\\" 1817. Famous parishioners included Chief Justice John Marshall, whose family occupied pew No. 23; Edgar Allan Poe, whose foster parents, the Allans, were members and occupied pew No. 80; the Marquis de Lafayette when he visited Richmond in 1824; William Mayo of Powhatan; and the Chamberlayne family.Richmond News Leader, \\"Monumental Church.\\" Dec 3, 1946. Three Richmond congregations were formed from Monumental, including: St. James's in 1831, St. Paul's in 1845 and All Saints in 1888. Deconsecrated in 1965, it was given by the Medical College of Virginia to the Historic Richmond Foundation, an affiliate of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. In 2004, Monumental Church underwent a significant renovation, although the bodies of the victims are still in a brick crypt below the church. During the renovation, the original monument to the 72 people killed in the fire was replaced by an exact replica. The documentary Saving Grace-Resurrecting American History follows the process of using laser scanning to recreate the monument in computers, then sending the data to Ireland, where stonecutters used both high technology computer equipment and old-fashioned stone-cutting tools to create a new 7,000 pound monument. In 2006, regular tours began, in cooperation with the Valentine Richmond History Center's Court End Passport. The building is open on occasion for other private functions. =New Richmond Theatre= New Richmond Theatre, as photographed in 1858 A new theater by the same name ‚Äì Richmond Theatre ‚Äì was built in Richmond in 1819, at a cost of US $40,000. It was built of brick at the corner of H and Seventh Street with a well-equipped stage and popular motif ornamentation.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, the Royal Navy interned Kaiserin and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles.

Kaiserin was raised in May 1936 and subsequently broken up for scrap.  Design  alt=A large warship with five gun turrets, two tall masts, two funnels, and heavy armor protection. The ship was long overall and displaced a maximum of . She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. Kaiserin was powered by three sets of Parsons turbines, each of which drove a single propeller shaft; they were supplied with steam by 16 coal-fired boilers. The powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Kaiserin was armed with a main battery of ten 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a superfiring pair aft. The other two turrets were placed en echelon amidships, such that both could fire on the broadside. The ship was also armed with fourteen 15 cm SK L/45 guns in casemates amidships, eight 8.8 cm SK L/45 guns in casemates and four 8.8 cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the hull. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by of KCA on the sides and faces. Kaiserins conning tower was heavily armored, with sides.  Service history  Ordered under the contract name Ersatz Hagen as a replacement for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Kaiserin was laid down at the Howaldtswerke dockyard in Kiel in November 1910. She was launched on 11 November 1911, after which fitting-out work was completed. At the launching ceremony, Admiral Hans von Koester gave a speech and Princess Victoria Louise christened the ship. A dockyard crew delivered the ship to the Navy on 13 May 1913; she was commissioned into the fleet the following day. During trials the ship's turbine engines were damaged, and Kaiserin did not join the fleet until 13 December 1913. After joining III Battle Squadron in December 1913, Kaiserin participated in the routine fleet training exercises. Squadron exercises were conducted in February, followed by fleet maneuvers, both in the North Sea. The fleet trained again in May, in both the North and Baltic Seas. Kaiserin left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Upon returning to Germany, Kaiserin steamed to Brunsb√ºttel on 24 July, where she was the first battleship to traverse the recently deepened Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The voyage required lightening, and in just under twelve hours Kaiserin exited the locks at Holtenau in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful Grand Fleet, declared war on Germany. Kaiserin was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding Kaiserin and her four sisters‚Äîand eight pre- dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. Kaiserin went into the Baltic for squadron training from 23 to 29 January 1915. Upon returning to the North Sea, the ship went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance, which lasted from 31 January to 20 February. The Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February, following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank the month before. Admiral Hugo von Pohl succeeded him as the commander of the fleet. Pohl continued the policy of sweeps into the North Sea to destroy isolated British formations. The fleet conducted a series of advances into the North Sea throughout 1915; Kaiserin was present for the sweeps on 17 to 18 May, 29 to 30 May, 10 August, 11 to 12 September, and 23 to 24 October. III Squadron completed the year with another round of unit training in the Baltic from 5 to 20 December. Pohl's tenure as fleet commander was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened him to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Kaiserin was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April. = Battle of Jutland = alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Kaiserin was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916; her commander at the time was Kapit√§n zur See (KzS) Karl Sievers. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Kaiserin was the second ship in VI Division of III Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of Kaiser and ahead of Prinzregent Luitpold. VI Division was behind only V Division, consisting of the four s. The eight battleships of the - and es assigned to I and II Divisions in I Squadron followed VI Division. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. At 16:19, Kaiserin was forced to temporarily stop the turbine on the center shaft, as the condenser had started leaking. The crew were able to restart the engine before Kaiserin came into action. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, , spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. At approximately 17:40, the British light cruiser fired a single torpedo at Kaiserin at the extreme range of at least , which failed to find its target. After Scheer ordered the fleet to open fire, Kaiserin briefly engaged the battlecruiser ; Kaiserin failed to score a hit and by 17:54 New Zealand and the rest of the British battlecruisers had increased speed and moved out of range. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. Kaiserin and her three sisters fired on Nomad with their secondary guns while the I Squadron battleships dispatched Nestor. At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Kaiserin fired three salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four- funneled cruiser but made no hits. Shortly after 19:00, a shell from the British battlecruiser disabled the German cruiser ; Rear Admiral Behncke in K√∂nig attempted to maneuver III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled Wiesbaden. Between 19:14 and 19:17, several German battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on Defence and Warrior. Kaiserin initially engaged one of the battleships in the British 5th Battle Squadron and scored a hit; according to Kaiserins logs, the ship in question was . After three minutes firing at Malaya, Kaiserin shifted fire to Defence. In short succession, the German dreadnoughts hit Defence with several heavy caliber shells. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a tremendous explosion, destroyed the cruiser. After Defence exploded, Kaiserin shifted her fire to a target believed to be the battlecruiser . Heavy haze forced Kaiserin to check fire after two salvos. By 20:00, Scheer ordered the German line to complete a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold and was forced to haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship from the rear of the German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line. After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiserin, Kaiser, Prinzregent Luitpold, and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In the course of the battle, Kaiserin fired one-hundred and sixty 30.5 cm shells and one-hundred and thirty-five 15 cm rounds. She emerged from the battle completely unscathed. = Subsequent operations = In early August, Kaiserin and the rest of the operational III Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic. On 18 August, Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîsupported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kaiser, would trail behind and provide cover. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another fleet advance followed on 18 to 20 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, Kaiserin took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats, and , that had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four K√∂nig-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including Kaiserin, were transferred to IV Squadron. While transiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on 14 March 1917, Kaiserin became grounded. One of her bilge keels was damaged and some of water entered the ship. Repairs were conducted at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel from 15 to 18 March. Kaiserin returned to the North Sea on 30 March and remained there on guard duty until 8 June. On 9 June, she went to the Baltic for a month-long series of exercises, which were completed on 2 July. She resumed guard duties in the German Bight on 3 July and continued in this role until 11 September, when Kaiserin was detached to join the special unit assigned to Operation Albion. = Operation Albion = alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of √ñsel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. By this time, IV Battle Squadron had come under the command of Vice Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000 men. The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Kaiserin and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on √ñsel. Kaiserin, along with Kaiser and Prinzregent Luitpold, were tasked with silencing the Russian guns at Hundsort on √ñsel, which had taken Moltke under fire. The ships opened fire at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian firing had ceased and German troops were moving ashore. Two days later, Souchon left Tagga Bay with Kaiserin, Friedrich der Grosse, and Prinzregent Luitpold to support German ground forces advancing on the Sworbe Peninsula. Kaiserin was assigned to suppress a Russian battery at Zerel, though heavy fog delayed her from engaging her target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by Kaiserin and K√∂nig Albert. Friedrich der Grosse came to the two ships' assistance; the three battleships fired a total of 120 large-caliber shells over the span of an hour. The fourth Russian salvo straddled Kaiserin, which began to steer erratically to avoid the Russian gunfire. The heavy firing prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts. On the night of 15 October, Kaiserin and K√∂nig Albert were sent to replenish their coal stocks in Putzig. On the 19th, they were briefly joined in Putzig by Friedrich der Grosse, which continued on to Arensburg with Moltke. The next morning, Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt ordered the special naval unit to be dissolved and returned to the North Sea. In a communique to the naval headquarters, Schmidt noted that \\"Kaiserin and K√∂nig Albert can immediately be detached from Putzig to the North Sea.\\" The two ships then proceeded to Kiel via Danzig; after reaching Kiel, they transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal back to the North Sea. = Final operations = On 17 November 1917, Kaiserin and Kaiser were assigned to provide cover for II Scouting Group while it conducted a minesweeping operation in the North Sea. Significant British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers, attacked II Scouting Group; the two battleships immediately steamed to their assistance. In the ensuing Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, Kaiserin scored a hit on the light cruiser . The battlecruiser briefly engaged the German dreadnoughts, but both forces withdrew. After the action, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter criticized Kaiserins commander, KzS Kurt Gra√ühoff, for lagging too far behind the minesweepers to provide adequate protection. He was subsequently relieved of command of the ship. Kaiserin went into drydock for maintenance on 22 December, and work lasted until 5 February 1918. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23‚Äì25 April 1918, which had been intended to intercept a heavily defended convoy between Britain and Norway; faulty German intelligence prevented the Germans from catching the convoy. After returning to port, she resumed guard duties in the German Bight. IV Squadron undertook another training exercise in the Baltic from 18 June to 13 August. A final round of drills took place on 22‚Äì28 October. = Fate = alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Kaiserin and her four sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy. The goal was to improve Germany's bargaining position in the imminent peace negotiations, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any circumstances. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiserin sank at 14:00; she was subsequently raised on 14 May 1936 and broken up later that year in Rosyth.

Several fan styles were common and a plethora of materials were used to create them. Subject matter varied greatly, from Biblical scenes to landscapes. Hand fans serve as a cooling mechanism, social instrument, and fashion accessory.  History  Fans were used throughout history, and can be traced back as long as five thousand years ago. They developed in ancient Egypt, India and China, where they were used for ceremonies and practical purposes.Steele, Valerie. The Fan: Fashion and Femininity Unfolded. New York: Rizzoli, 2002. Print. In the 12th century, during the Crusades, the fan was brought to Europe.Alexander, H√©l√®ne. Fans. London: B.T. Batsford, 1984. Print. At first, Europeans adopted the rigid fan and feather fans. Queen Elizabeth I of England (1533‚Äì1603) owned dozens of these fans, as was shown in her portraits. Later in the 16th century, folding fans were introduced into Europe from Japan where they originated. thumb thumb Once the fan was known to Europe, France became the center for fan design and production. At the end of the 17th century, Huguenot immigrants traveled to England, bringing the fan craft with them. French fans were so popular that they were smuggled into England during the 18th century. During this time the Worshipful Company of Fan Makers tried to grow the English fan trade, but their success was small in comparison to the French industry.  Types  There were two main types of fans seen in Europe during the 18th century: the rigid (or fixed) fan and the folding fan. = Rigid fan = As its name implies, the rigid fan is stiff. Possible fan shapes are a leaf, a rectangle, or an oval. The fan is attached to a base where it is held. = Folding fan = The folding fan was the most popular in Europe during the 18th century, a time known as the golden age of the folding fan.\\"Fans.\\" The Decoratosr and Furnisher 24.5 (1894): 182. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010. The principal folding fan styles are pleated, bris√©, and cockade. thumb  Pleated fan  The pleated fan consists of a mount and a set of sticks. The outer sticks (the guards) are wider than the others and are often more decorated. At the base of the sticks is a pivot which connects the fan and allows it to spread and open. The base is either shaped or rounded off.  Bris√© fan  The bris√© fan consists only of a set of sticks. These sticks are attached to a base with a pivot similar to that of a pleated fan. A cord or ribbon runs across the top of the fan, holding the sticks together. thumb  Cockade fan  A Parisian Cockade fan of silk and ivory, 1800-1850 A cockade fan opens into a complete circle around the pivot. Their style can be either pleated or bris√©. They were not very practical and considered too flamboyant, and thus they saw little popularity.  Materials  Fans in the 18th century were made from a wide variety of materials depending on their style and purpose. During the 18th century fans were a fashion accessory and thus were made from the fashionable materials of the time.Mayor, Susan. Collecting Fans. New York: Mayflower, 1980. Print. = Sticks and handles = Sticks and handles could be made of gold, tortoise shell, ivory, mother-of-pearl, horn, or wood. They were often highly decorated. Most sticks and handles were not only made of the previously listed materials, but were inlaid with others. For example, a mother-of-pearl fan could be inlaid with gold. Other sticks were plain. = Mounts = Previous to 1780, mounts were typically made of vellum or paper. Some, more valuable fans were decorated with materials used for the sticks such as mother-of-pearl. Other decorations included feathers, butterfly wings, silk, gold, and sequins. Although not as common, the 18th century also saw lace fans.  Subject matter  European fans were often decorated with historical, political, or social images. While some fans were meant to inform, others were meant to entertain. There was fan for every occasion; whether it be a wedding, a funeral, or a dance, there was always a fan made specifically for the event.Bennett, Anna G., and Ruth Berson. Fans in Fashion. [San Francisco]: Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1981. Print. = Entertainment = Some artists designed fans which would prevent boredom during a dull event, or would start a conversation. These fans were often covered with riddles and puzzles.Esdaile, Arundell. \\"Fans.\\" British Museum Quarterly 14.1 (1940): 23-24. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010. Another type of entertainment fan was the fortune-telling fan. These presented questions such as ‚ÄúWhether one is to get Riches; Whether one will be successful in Love; What sort of Husband shall I have; etc.‚Äù = Instructive = The 18th century saw fans which assisted in remembering holidays or that served as maps. The fan, ‚ÄúMap of Warwickshire‚Äù is such a fan.Schreiber, Charlotte. Fans and Fan-Leaves. Comp. Lionel Cust. London: Oxford UP, 1893. Print. = Historical = Fans commonly recorded current events. There were souvenir fans that depicted scenes such as Vesuvius erupting and the Coliseum. Others celebrated public events such as a military victory. The fan, ‚ÄúCoronation of George II‚Äù shows the banquet of George II and Queen Caroline in Westminster Hall on their coronation day, October 11, 1727. = Biblical and classical = Classical myths and biblical scenes were frequent during the early 18th century. Fans for church depicted Bible subjects such as Jacob and Rachel or Ruth and Boaz. The fan, ‚ÄúMoses Striking the Rock‚Äù shows the Israelite encampment in the wilderness and Moses standing by the rock from which water flows. = Pastoral = Later in the 18th century, rococo pastoral scenes became popular. Landscapes were common as well as images with love and courtship themes. Cupid was often a principal figure on such fans. The fan, ‚ÄúPastoral Landscape‚Äù shows a river landscape with men and women walking by and sheep grazing.  Purposes  = Practical = When originated, the fan‚Äôs purpose was to cool the face and keep away insects. Before the 18th century their most common use was to keep flies away from church altars.Standen, Edith. \\"Acquisitions of Works of Art by Museums and Galleries: Supplement.\\" The Burlington Magazine 107.750 (1965): 487. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010. While driving insects away became less and less of a fan‚Äôs purpose, the fan continued to serve as a cooling mechanism. = Fashion = In Europe, fans were not a necessity. They were mainly used as a fashion accessory, to complement the rest of the lady‚Äôs outfit. ‚ÄúFans were as much an adjunct to a lady of fashion‚Äôs attire as were gloves or bags.‚Äù By the 18th century fans were used only by females. The fan was described as the ‚Äúfeminine accessory, par excellence.‚Äù = Propaganda = Subject matter such as historical and political events made fans a means of spreading news or political propaganda. Other fans contained brand names and store fronts and thus acted as advertisements. = Social instrument ‚Äì fan language = Due to their large use and popularity, fans began to affect gestures and thus a fan ‚Äúsign language‚Äù developed between 1711 and 1740. In a 1740 edition of the Gentleman's Magazine, there was an advertisement for ‚ÄúThe New Fashioned Speaking FAN!‚Äù This ‚Äúspeaking fan‚Äù created a system whereby motions of the fan translated into letters of the alphabet. The alphabet, with the exception of J, was split into five sections. These sections corresponded to one of the following movements: # Moving the fan with the left hand to the left arm # Moving the fan with the right hand to the left arm # Placing the fan against the bosom # Raising the fan to the mouth # Raising the fan to the forehead In order to signal a letter two movements were necessary. The first corresponded to one of the five alphabet groups, and the second told the letter‚Äôs position in the group. For example, to signal ‚ÄúD‚Äù, one would use movement 1 (first section of the alphabet), followed by movement 4 (fourth letter in that section of the alphabet).  Current status  Fans are often considered minor works of art. Many survived and are in the hands of owners or museums throughout the world.

Life Henry Clay Whitney was born on 23 February 1831 in Detroit, Maine, son of Alfred Metcalf Whitney of Chicago. He received a classical education at Augusta College, Kentucky and at Farmer's College, Ohio, and then studied Law at the Cincinnati and Chicago law schools. In 1854 he moved to Urbana, Illinois, where he entered the practice of law. Around the time when he first appeared at the bar, Whitney met Lincoln, whom he found unselfishly helpful. Whitney became one of Lincoln's friends and political allies, helping him on the Illinois circuit. On 5 August 1857 Whitney married Sarah Ann Snyder, then aged 16. They had five children, two boys and three girls, born between 1858 and 1868. On 6 August 1861, at the start of the American Civil War, Whitney was appointed Assistant U.S. Paymaster, holding this office until 13 March 1865. While in this office, $11 million passed through his hands. After the war, he settled in Kansas, where he practiced the law, engaged in politics and edited a newspaper. Later he returned to Chicago, where he continued to practice the law. Whitney died in 1905. Works Whitney published a two- volume biography of Lincoln, Lincoln the citizen and Lincoln the President, which was published in 1892. He also published an account of his time with Lincoln in Life on the circuit with Lincoln in 1892. He published a version of \\"Lincoln's Lost Speech\\" in McClure's Magazine in 1896. The speech was made at the Illinois State Republican Convention at Bloomington, Illinois on May 29, 1856, and was said to have been Lincoln's finest. Whitney claimed his version was based on notes he had made while the speech was being delivered, but the accuracy has been questioned due to the 40-year delay before publication. Whitney has been described as \\"an unscrupulous reporter\\", willing to stretch the facts to make his point. Benjamin Thomas, another biographer of Lincoln, wrote: \\"Never a man to underestimate his own powers, Whitney was held at a somewhat lower valuation by his colleagues.\\" Bibliography  * References  Further reading  * External links Works by Henry Clay Whitney at Project Gutenberg 1831 births 1905 deaths Illinois lawyers People from Somerset County, Maine ","title":"Henry Clay Whitney"},{"id":"30063581","text":"The Salas River at Tourem, Portugal The Salas River (; ) is a tributary of the Lima.

Newton was not listed in the Domesday Book and was probably settled later, with its first mention appearing in 1210. According to Gardiner, \\"[i]n 1286 Sir Roger de Colvil[l]e married Desiderata, grand- daughter of Sir Stephen de Maresco, lord of Newton, Walsoken, and Tidd St Giles, and through her acquired Newton which became the chief residence of the (Colville) family for over 500 hundred years\\", until it was sold in 1792. The College of St Mary by the Sea was founded here during the reign of Henry IV by Sir John Colville. Its endowments were specifically exempted from dissolution in the 1547 legislation of Edward VI, the lands instead being transferred to support the rectory of Newton. The parish church of St James is a medieval structure with a tower. Formerly dedicated to St Katherine, it was built in the 12th century and widened in the 14th. Woad (or wad) was grown and processed in the area. Woad mills were of two types:- permanent and temporary. The temporary woad mill taken down at Parson Drove in 1914 for the final time had previously been located at Newton, Spalding, Tydd St.Giles and Whaplode Marsh. Woad mills remained at Algarkirk until 1927 and Skirbeck until 1932. A model of a woad mill is on display in Wisbech & Fenland museum. A village public house, The White Lion, closed in 1993 In 2016 Newton reverted to its earlier name of Newton-in-the-Isle A further public house, The Woadman's Arms, which derived its name from the woad that was grown in the village until the 19th century, closed in 2017.

He held office as Attorney General for Ireland and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Background and education Monahan was born in Portumna, County Galway, the son of Michael Monahan and his wife Mary Bloomfield, daughter of Stephen Bloomfield of Eyrecourt. He went to school in Banagher and graduated from the University of Dublin with a gold medal in 1823. He joined Gray's Inn in 1826, and the King's Inns in 1823.  Professional career  Monahan was called to the Bar in 1828 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1840. He was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1846 and Attorney-General for Ireland in 1847, and briefly represented Galway Borough in the House of Commons. During this period he acted as principal counsel for the Crown in numerous State trials, including those of John Mitchel, Thomas Francis Meagher, Charles Gavan Duffy, and William Smith O'Brien. He was accused of packing juries, a charge he vehemently denied; a charge of anti-Catholic bias he laughed off by pointing out that he was a Catholic himself. As a lawyer, he was noted for his self-control even in times of acute crisis. Judge  In 1850, Monahan was appointed Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas and held that office till 1876. He was generally agreed to have been one of the best Irish judges of his time: Elrington Ball states that during his long career he had the complete confidence of the Bar and the public,Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray, London, 1926 and it is notable that the Fenian trials of 1865-6 did not damage his reputation as they did that of his colleague William Keogh. He had the reputation of being \\"a thoroughly learned lawyer\\" but also one who brought strong common-sense to bear on a problem. Even Lord Westbury, the English Lord Chancellor, who disliked him, said patronisingly that Monahan \\"does know his law\\".Delaney, V.T.H. Christopher Palles Allan Figgis, Dublin 1960 Although he was impulsive and hot-tempered off the Bench, he was usually calm and controlled on it, and famed for his ability to \\"crush\\" counsel. Under stress according to one vivid description, he would \\"pace up and down the bench like a caged lion\\". He retired, due to failing health, in 1876, and died two years later. Of the civil trials he presided over the case which probably aroused the most interest was the Yelverton case, one of several cases heard in a number of countries where Major Yelverton, hoping to make a wealthy marriage, tried to rid himself of the inconvenience of his existing marriage to Miss Longworth. In Ireland initially he failed, as the lady's legal team convinced the jury that the marriage was valid (their verdict was reversed on appeal). In his last years he, like most of his colleagues, was much troubled by the level of violent crime in Ireland, in particular the number of unsolved murders, many of them apparently linked to agrarian feuds. Addressing the Grand Jury of County Meath in 1870, he referred to several recent sensational crimes in the county, Notably the Ledwithe poisonings (the so called \\"poison potato cake\\" case), and the murder of an elderly shopkeeper, Margaret McCormack, which was believed to be linked to the poisonings. none of which had been solved, and remarked that he feared the country was enduring a \\"reign of terror\\". \\"Meath Murder Mystery: The case of the poison potato cake\\" Irish Times 26/12/2019  Personality and family life  Off the bench Monahan was a somewhat alarming personality : he was fierce in manner, impulsive, and give to peppering his conversation with swearwords. Lord Westbury, while grudgingly admitting his legal ability, referred to him disparagingly as \\"that voluble Irish savage\\".Delaney, op. cit. His many friends, however, insisted that his fierce manner concealed a genuine warmth of character. He married Fanny Harrington on 16 June 1832; they had two sons and six daughters, including James Henry Monahan, QC (d.1900). The marriage was a happy one and Fanny's death was a great blow to her husband; during his last years he visited her grave at Glasnevin Cemetery each week.

Early life and education O'Brien was born in Melbourne and educated at Sacred Heart Primary School, and then overseas at Marion Donaldson Elementary School (in Tucson, Arizona), Rygaards International School (in Copenhagen, Denmark) and Hendrik Louw School (in Strand, South Africa). He returned to Melbourne where he attended Xavier College, then studied law and economics at Monash University. Legal career Prior to being elected to Parliament, he practised as a Barrister at the Supreme Court of Victoria and as a solicitor at King & Wood Mallesons. O'Brien has also been the licensee of the Penshurst Hotel and involved in primary production and live music, being a bass player in local Melbourne bands Loin Groin, the Histrionics and Stubble. David was involved as a supporter of Live Music in the ‚ÄúSave the Espy‚Äù Campaign in the late 1990s and early 2000s concerning the Esplanade Hotel in St. Kilda Victoria. David Played Australian Rules Football with Monash Whites Football Club and Penshurst Football and Netball Club. Political career O'Brien was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council as a Member for the Western Victoria Region at the 2010 election. Previously he was the unsuccessful Nationals candidate for the seat of South West Coast at the 2006 election. He is the only National to be elected to the upper house from Western Victoria since the changeover to the regional proportional representation system at the 2006 election. O'Brien was the Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Legislative Council, but lost his seat in 2014 to James Purcell, representing Vote 1 Local Jobs. Whilst in Parliament he served on the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee, the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee, the Family and Community Development Committee, the Accountability and Oversight Committee, the Legal and Social Issues Committee, the House Committee and in 2014 as chair of the Rural and Regional Committee. David was a member of the Family and Community Development Committee's Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations. Known as the Betrayal of Trust Inquiry, it uncovered shocking widespread and systemic abuse of children in multiple organisations dating back decades. The Inquiry's 750 page report was tabled in November 2013 and recommended wide-sweeping legislative changes to both civil and criminal laws. The recommendations allowed victims to seek adequate compensation and recommended new criminal offences for those who turned a blind eye to sexual abuse. The inquiry was important in leading to legislative reforms which removed the statute of limitations on historical sexual abuse claims and was a catalyst for the Commonwealth Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Prior to the 2014 election, O'Brien considered switching to the safe lower house seat of Lowan, which commentators views as a logical move to safeguard O'Brien's parliamentary career and position himself as a future party leader. However, it is believed that the move was blocked by then-deputy leader Peter Walsh, who preferred to see the seat filled by a woman. In September 2015, O'Brien was pre-selected by the National Party to contest the Polwarth state by-election following the resignation of the Liberal MP Terry Mulder. He was unsuccessful.

Located in the Shenandoah Valley, it is situated north of Harrisonburg, south of Bergton, and west of Timberville. The border with West Virginia is nearby, as is the edge of George Washington National Forest. Cootes Store is within a gorge where the North Fork Shenandoah River breaks, at the crossroads of Route 613 and Route 259. Etymology The name of the community is derived from that of Samuel Cootes, owner of the eponymous store. He was a prominent local landholder and member of the community, who later served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates.Advertisement in the Rockingham Register, dated Saturday, January 23, 1836 History Isolated villages needed a general supply store, and Cootes supplied that need for two Virginia towns, Cootes Store and Dovesville (renamed Bergton). Located a mile from Brocks Gap, Cootes Store was a rendezvous point for working men meeting on a Saturday afternoon, given its strategical location. Historic photographs reveal that from earlier times it was always an agricultural community with cowboys. In 1870, merchants began using the Shenandoah River from Brock's Gap to Cootes Store for transporting people and goods. By 1900, Cootes Store had a one-room public school. In 1936, Cootes Store and Bergton were affected by the Great Flood. At worst, the water was four feet deep and washed away many barns, cottages and other features in the area. Today, the community consists of many barns. Transportation Around 1880, a covered bridge was built over an older bridge at Cootes Store to cross the river's North Fork, placing the road at a higher level. Like other towns along the Shenandoah River, Cootes Store also boasted a swinging bridge.Turner & Ritchie, p. 42 Evergreen, 1921 Gallery File:Cootes Store2.jpg File:Cootes Store3.jpg File:Cootes Store4.jpg File:Cootes Store5.jpg References External links *Official site Unincorporated communities in Rockingham County, Virginia Unincorporated communities in Virginia ","title":"Cootes Store, Virginia"},{"id":"30064041","text":"Candlelight Farms Airport , is located in New Milford, Connecticut, United States.

The object experiencing fission is usually a cell, but the term may also refer to how organisms, bodies, populations, or species split into discrete parts. The fission may be binary fission, in which a single organism produces two parts, or multiple fission, in which a single entity produces multiple parts. Binary fission Schematic diagram of cellular growth (elongation) and binary fission of bacilli. Blue and red lines indicate old and newly generated bacterial cell wall, respectively. (1) growth at the centre of the bacterial body. e.g. Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, and others. (2) apical growth. e.g. Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Organisms in the domains of Archaea and Bacteria reproduce with binary fission. This form of asexual reproduction and cell division is also used by some organelles within eukaryotic organisms (e.g., mitochondria). Binary fission results in the reproduction of a living prokaryotic cell (or organelle) by dividing the cell into two parts, each with the potential to grow to the size of the original. =Fission of prokaryotes= The single DNA molecule first replicates, then attaches each copy to a different part of the cell membrane. When the cell begins to pull apart, the replicated and original chromosomes are separated. The consequence of this asexual method of reproduction is that all the cells are genetically identical, meaning that they have the same genetic material (barring random mutations). Unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis used by eukaryotic cells, binary fission takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. Like in mitosis (and unlike in meiosis), the parental identity is preserved. Process of FtsZ-dependent fission Binary fission in a prokaryote The process of binary fission in bacteria involves the following steps. First, the cell's DNA is replicated. The replicated DNA copies then move to opposite poles of the cell in an energy- dependent process. The cell lengthens. Then, the equatorial plane of the cell constricts and separates the plasma membrane such that each new cell has exactly the same genetic material. More specifically, the following steps occur: # The bacterium before binary fission is when the DNA is tightly coiled. # The DNA of the bacterium has uncoiled and duplicated. # The DNA is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. # The growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by FtsZ polymerization and \\"Z-ring\\" formation) # The new cell wall (septum) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. # The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids; these are now brand-new organisms. Studies of bacteria made to not produce a cell wall, called L-form bacteria, shows that FtsZ requires a cell wall to work. Little is known about how bacteria that naturally don't grow a cell wall divides, but it is thought to resemble the L-form's budding- like division process of extrusion and separation. Speed of FtsZ-dependent fission Binary fission is generally rapid though its speed varies between species. For E. coli, cells typically divide about every 20 minutes at 37 ¬∞C. Because the new cells will, in turn, undergo binary fission on their own, the time binary fission requires is also the time the bacterial culture requires to double in the number of cells it contains. This time period can, therefore, be referred to as the doubling time. Some species other than E. coli may have faster or slower doubling times: some strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may have doubling times of nearly 100 hours. Bacterial growth is limited by factors including nutrient availability and available space, so binary fission occurs at much lower rates in bacterial cultures once they enter the stationary phase of growth.  In archaea  Crenarchaeota possess neither a cell wall nor the FtsZ mechanism. They use a primitive version of the eukaryotic ESCRT-III system (also known as Cdv) to manipulate the membrane into separating, specifically by coming into the middle of the two soon-to-be daughter cells. Euryarchaeota use FtsZ like bacteria do.u =Fission of organelles= Some organelles in eukaryotic cells reproduce using binary fission. Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently within the cell, even when the cell is not actively undergoing mitosis, and is necessary to regulate the cell's metabolism. All chloroplasts and some mitochrondria (not in animals), both organelles derived from endosymbiosis of bacteria, also use FtsZ in a bacteria-like fashion. =Types of binary fission= Binary fission in organisms can occur in four ways, irregular, longitudinal, transverse, oblique.i.e.left oblique & right oblique # Irregular: In this fission, cytokinesis may take place along any plane but it is always perpendicular to the plane of karyokinesis. e.g. amoeba # Longitudinal: Here cytokinesis takes place along the longitudinal axis. e.g. in flagellates like Euglena. # Transverse: Here cytokinesis takes place along the transverse axis. e.g. in ciliate protozoans like Paramecium. # Oblique: In this type of binary fission cytokinesis occurs obliquely. Example Ceratium Multiple fission =Fission of protists= Multiple fission at the cellular level occurs in many protists, e.g. sporozoans and algae. The nucleus of the parent cell divides several times by amitosis, producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm then separates, creating multiple daughter cells. Some parasitic, single-celled organisms undergo a multiple fission-like process to produce numerous daughter cells from a single parent cell. Isolates of the human parasite Blastocystis hominis were observed to begin such a process within 4 to 6 days. Cells of the fish parasite Trypanosoma borreli have also been observed participating in both binary and multiple fission. Fission of apicomplexans In the apicomplexans, a phylum of parasitic protists, multiple fission, or schizogony, is manifested either as merogony, sporogony or gametogony. Merogony results in merozoites, which are multiple daughter cells, that originate within the same cell membrane, sporogony results in sporozoites, and gametogony results in microgametes. Fission of green algae Green algae can divide into more than two daughter cells. The exact number of daughter cells depends on the species of algae and is an effect of temperature and light. =Multiple fission of bacteria= Most species of bacteria primarily undergo binary reproduction. Some species and groups of bacteria may undergo multiple fission as well, sometimes beginning or ending with the production of spores. The species Metabacterium polyspora, a symbiont of guinea pigs, has been found to produce multiple endospores in each division. Some species of cyanobacteria have also been found to reproduce through multiple fission. Plasmotomy Some protozoans reproduce by yet another mechanism of fission called as plasmotomy. In this type of fission, a multinucleate adult parent undergoes cytokinesis to form two multinucleate (or coenocytic) daughter cells. The daughter cells so produced undergo further mitosis. Opalina and Pelomyxa reproduce in this way. Clonal fragmentation Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism. In echinoderms, this method of reproduction is usually known as fissiparity. Population fission Any splitting of a single population of individuals into discrete parts may be considered fission. A population may undergo fission for a variety of reasons, including migration or geographic isolation. Because the fission leads to genetic variance in the newly isolated, smaller populations, population fission is a precursor to speciation.

Conservation Genetics 2:233-243. doi = 10.1023/A:1012263717279 The genus Brachaspis is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Although a grasshopper, it is a poor jumper, relying on camouflage to hide from predators. It is threatened by introduced mammals such as stoats, hedgehogs, and rats. The New Zealand entomologist Dr Tara Murray told North & South magazine in 2019: ‚ÄúThey can actually jump, they just don‚Äôt land very well. On a hot day, an adult male can jump up to 1.5m, multiple times. Females are bulkier, so they don‚Äôt jump as far. These grasshoppers freeze as a first defence. If they do jump, it often ends as a back flop, belly flop or general ‚Äòthock‚Äô on the ground.‚Äù Species description B. robustus is extremely well camouflaged, often relying on visual crypsis as passive defense against predation. It is also sexually dimorphic; adult males have a body length of 18‚Äì22 mm (0.71‚Äì0.87 in.) and adult females 38‚Äì42 mm (1.5‚Äì1.7 in.).White, E. G. 1994. Ecological research and monitoring of the protected grasshopper Brachaspis robustus in the Mackenzie Basin. Pages 1-50. Department of Conservation, Wellington, New Zealand.

Identification of the immature stages of New Zealand alpine Acridid grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Transactions of the Royal Society of New Zealand Biological Sciences 12:185-208. The wings on B. robustus are very small, between , making this species flightless like most of New Zealand grasshoppers. There are three known colour morphs for adult B. robustus: 'Grey', 'Orange' and 'Black'. The most common colour morph is 'Grey' at approximately 60% of adult B. robustus; 'Orange' is about 40%, and the very rare 'Black' is less than 0.5%. File:NZAcrididae7.JPGColour morph 'Grey'. File:NZAcrididae5.JPGColour morph 'Orange'. File:NZAcrididae6.jpgColour morph 'Black'. B. robustus nymph is visually cryptic when surrounded by rocky habitat. Distribution B. robustus is only known from the Tekapo, Pukaki and Ohau river catchments in the Mackenzie Basin. It can be found as far south as Lake Benmore (44¬∞20‚Ä≤29‚Ä≥S 170¬∞12‚Ä≤42‚Ä≥E) and as far north as the upper Fork Stream (43¬∞58‚Ä≤24‚Ä≥S 170¬∞24‚Ä≤04‚Ä≥E). The altitudinal distribution of Brachaspis robustus is between 352 m (1,155 ft) on the lower Ohau River and 1,060 m (3,480 ft) the upper Fork Stream. Detailed searches since 1980 have been carried out throughout the Mackenzie Basin and a good understanding of its current distribution is now known.Morris, S.J. 2005. The resurvey of the old historic Brachaspis robustus sites in the Mackenzie Basin. Department of Conservation, Twizel, New Zealand. Life History A mating pair of B. robustus showing that the female is much larger than the male. The lifespan of B. robustus is approximately two years. Eggs are laid from early summer to mid autumn. Adult females probably lay two egg batches a season, each containing between 20‚Äì32 eggs. The majority of nymph emergence occurs in mid-summer, but early instar B. robustus have been seen later in the season. Because of the timing of emergence, it is thought eggs require a winter period in order to develop fully. This not an uncommon requirement for New Zealand grasshoppers.Mason, P. C. 1971. PhD Thesis: Alpine grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in the southern alps of Canterbury, New Zealand University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.Harper, G. M. 1972. MSc Thesis: The life history and laboratory rearing of Phaulacridium marginale (Walker)(Orthoptera: Acrididae). University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. The nymphs then overwinter, often surviving temperatures well below 0 ¬∞C, and reach adulthood the following summer. Adult males will copulate with multiple females and vice versa, suggesting this species has a promiscuous mating system. The ratio of male to female B. robustus alters over New Zealand summer: at the start of the summer in November the ratio is 56% male and 44% female. By December females (57%) outnumber males (43%). For the rest of summer, males predominate: in January at 54% male to 46% female, and in March 82% male and only 18% female.Morris, S.J. 2005. Setting up of monitoring sites for Brachaspis robustus in the Mackenzie Basin. Department of Conservation, New Zealand. Habitat and Diet Brachaspis robustus is always found in very rocky areas (stony floodplain terraces, fluvio-glacial outwash, recent fluvial outwash, and rocky braided river), and is never found in vegetation.Morris, S.J. Grasshopper Identification Sheet - Brachaspis robustus. Department of Conservation, Alexandra, New Zealand. It is a generalist herbivore and is known to eat Anthosachne scabra (syn. Elymus rectisetus) and Poa pratensis, the herb Achillea millifolium, and unidentified mosses and lichens. Faeces analysed during spring suggested that moss and lichen are important in its diet; this might reflect their ability to absorb moisture at night. Food succulence is important in grasshopper diets, and mosses and lichens may provide a means of withstanding the aridity and drought of the Mackenzie Basin.  Conservation  Two species of grasshopper are listed for protection under the Wildlife Act 1953 of New Zealand: B. robustus and Sigaus childi. Sigaus takahe is also indirectly protected as it is only known from the Murchison Mountains Specially Protected (Takahƒì) Area. As early as the 1960s, B. robustus was noted as rare and in need of conservation action.Bigelow, R. S. 1967. The grasshoppers of New Zealand, their taxonomy and distribution. University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1993, it was estimated that there were only approximately 800 adults in the wild. By the end of 2009/2010 summer it was estimated that this had declined to approximately 600 adults. In 1993, most adults were found in three key very large populations and only a few sub- populations; by 2010, numerous new sub-populations have been discovered, but the three key populations from 1993 were now very sparse and made up of numerous sub-populations. Introduced mammalian predators are one of the known threats to B. robustus.Schori, J. C., Maloney, R. F., Steeves, T. E. & Murray, T. J. (2018) Evidence that reducing mammalian predators is beneficial for threatened and declining New Zealand grasshoppers.

In July 2018 a 440 ha area in the Mackenzie Basin known as the \\"Tekapo Triangle\\" was transferred to the control of the Department of Conservation and set aside as a reserve for B. robustus.

She holds a Bachelor of Nursing and Graduate Certificate in Diabetes Education from Deakin University and a Certificate in Management and Leadership from Swinburne University. Professional career After leaving school, Crozier worked as an Admin Assistant in 1982, before completing general nurse training between 1983 and 1986. She completed midwifery training in 1990 and subsequently worked as a midwife between 1991 and 1994. Following this she worked as a consultant and hospital supervisor at the Royal Women's Hospital between 1994 and 2000. She was an Executive Search/Recruitment Consultant between 2000 and 2006, a Business Manager between 2006 and 2008, and a Business Consultant from 2008 until her election in 2010. Political career =Baillieu / Napthine Government (2010-2014)= In 2010, Crozier was elected as the fourth member for Southern Metropolitan Region. Following the resignation of Ted Baillieu in March 2013, Dennis Napthine became Premier appointing Crozier as Parliamentary Secretary for Health. Georgie chaired the Family and Community Development Committee's Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations. Known as the Betrayal of Trust Inquiry, it uncovered shocking widespread and systemic abuse of children in multiple organisations dating back decades. The Inquiry's 750 page report was tabled in November 2013 and recommended wide-sweeping legislative changes to both civil and criminal laws. The recommendations allowed victims to seek adequate compensation and recommended new criminal offences for those who turned a blind eye to sexual abuse. The inquiry was important in leading to legislative reforms which removed the statute of limitations on historical sexual abuse claims and was a catalyst for the Commonwealth Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. =Opposition (2014-present)= Following Napthine's defeat at the 2014 Election, Matthew Guy was elected leader of the Victorian Liberal Party and Crozier was appointed Shadow Minister for Families and Children, Shadow Minister for Prevention of Family Violence, Shadow Minister for Women and Shadow Cabinet Secretary. In September 2017, she was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing ceding her positions as Shadow Minister for Women and Shadow Cabinet Secretary.

The Dharhi speak the Awadhi dialect. Present circumstances The Dharhi are strictly endogamous, and practice consanguineous marriages. They prefer marriages within the lineage, which are known as biradaris. Members of a biradari are supposedly descended from a common male ancestor. There are said to be forty biradaris, the main ones being the Balrampuria, Chaurasiya, Jaunpuriya and Desi. The biradaris get their name from their place of origin. The Dharhi are still involved with singing and playing the table for their patron communities. A majority of the community are now daily wage labourers. They live in multi-caste villages, and each settlement has an informal caste council. These caste councils act as an instrument of social control. The Dharhi are Sunni Muslims, although they incorporate a number of folk beliefs.

He is best known as the frontman of the indietronica band Passion Pit. Career =Passion Pit (2008‚Äìpresent)= The first Passion Pit songs, which would later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and performed all his material alone using a laptop. After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent a considerable amount of time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh. =2007‚Äì09: Chunk of Change= The band's debut EP, Chunk of Change, was released on September 16, 2008. The first four tracks were those that Angelakos had written as a gift for his girlfriend, which had already become popular throughout the Emerson College campus, where Angelakos was attending classes at the time, and had been passing out his own, self-produced copies. The first and only single to be released from the EP, \\"Sleepyhead\\", received a good deal of exposure through its use in numerous media campaigns and advertisements, while the video for the song, directed by The Wilderness, was included on Pitchfork's Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list. The song contains samples of \\"√ìr√≥ Mo Bh√°id√≠n\\" by Irish singer and harpist Mary O'Hara. Other songs from the EP received some exposure as well. \\"Cuddle Fuddle\\" was featured in E4's second series of The Inbetweeners and \\"I've Got Your Number\\" was used in an advertisement for the cash card from O2, Money in the UK. =2009‚Äì11: Manners= The band's first full-length studio album, Manners, was released on May 18, 2009 in the UK and May 19, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In celebration, the band played their record release party on the 18th in New York City on a Rocks Off boat cruise. In order to obtain a specific background vocal accompaniment the band was looking for on Manners, Passion Pit enlisted the help of the PS22 chorus, who recorded vocals in-studio for three of the album's songs: \\"The Reeling\\", \\"Little Secrets\\", and \\"Let Your Love Grow Tall.\\" \\"The Reeling\\" was the first single to be released from the album and found success on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the fall of 2009, where it peaked at number 34 in October and \\"Little Secrets\\" was the third single to be released and had success on the chart as well, topping out at number 39. \\"Let Your Love Grow Tall\\" was never released as a single but had some exposure being used in the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the TV series Ugly Betty. The album's second single, \\"To Kingdom Come\\", was used in the Rhapsody commercial for its iPhone application. Michael Angelakos fronting Passion Pit at the Treasure Island Music Festival in 2009 \\"Sleepyhead\\" was the only track from Chunk of Change to be included on the album and was made available from iTunes for free as a discovery download in 2009. The song continued to receive additional exposure through its appearances in advertisements. It was used in a season 3 episode of the teen-drama, Skins and most recently in the debut trailer for LittleBigPlanet 2, which led to the band's increased popularity amongst fans and players of the game, who eventually created an in-game instrumental version of the song to listen to in the first game. When the sequel was released, it came with the song's actual instrumental version used in the trailer. The song \\"Moth's Wings\\" was used in the fourth episode of the third season of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl and in the closing credits of episode 36 of HBO's Big Love. It appeared in the FIFA 10 video game and was featured in the film Life as We Know It, starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. Additionally, the track has been used as a background theme for Sky Sports' coverage of the UEFA Champions League and as the music for a dance routine in Episode 5, Season 8, of the US television show So You Think You Can Dance, which received a standing ovation from the show's judges. It was also featured in MTV's show Awkward. In June 2009, the band performed at the Glastonbury Festival 2009 in Pilton, Somerset, England, where they dedicated the final song of their set to festival headliner Jarvis Cocker, who was to perform on the same stage later that same day. Afterwards, NME, while favorably reviewing Passion Pit's performance, incorrectly reported the band as having dedicated their entire set to Cocker. On April 13, 2010, the band reissued Manners in a deluxe edition format which contained new artwork and three additional tracks: stripped-down versions of \\"Sleepyhead\\" and \\"Moth's Wings\\" and a cover of The Cranberries' song \\"Dreams\\". The deluxe release coincided with the extension of their North American headlining tour. The band released another cover in June 2010, this time offering up their take on The Smashing Pumpkins hit song \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" as part of a promotion with Levi's called \\"Pioneer Sessions\\". In September 2010, Passion Pit toured with the English band Muse as their opening act for eight shows during their fall tour through parts of the U.S. Following those supporting shows, the band headlined the Campus Consciousness Tour, produced by Pretty Polly Productions in collaboration with Guster guitarist Adam Gardner's non-profit organization Reverb. The two-week tour featured stops at twelve college campuses and, in addition to the music, focused on promoting eco-friendly lifestyles. Opening acts for the tour included Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears and K. Flay. =2011‚Äì14: Gossamer= In an August 2010 interview with NME, Angelakos stated that work had already begun on the follow-up to Manners and that the band intended to release the album in the spring of 2011. He then said that it will be released early in 2012, and finally that the release date was July 24. On April 24, 2012, Angelakos announced the title of the album, Gossamer, and that it would be released on July 24, 2012. On May 7, the first track from Gossamer was released, called \\"Take a Walk\\". On June 12, the second track from Gossamer was released, called \\"I'll Be Alright\\". The track leaked early on June 11 and was released as an NME premiere on June 8. On July 9, a third track from Gossamer, called \\"Constant Conversations\\", was reviewed and featured as \\"best new track\\" by Pitchfork. It was released with the review as streamed content. Gossamer was officially released on July 20, 2012. On October 13, they performed on Saturday Night Live. They played \\"Take a Walk\\" and \\"Carried Away.\\" Angelakos, Kill The Noise and Fatman Scoop appeared on \\"Recess\\", the second single and title track from American record producer Skrillex's debut album Recess. The single was released on July 7, 2014. =2015‚Äì17: Kindred= On January 29, it was revealed that a new album, Kindred, was in the making. The album was released on April 21. On February 16, the official track listing was released. From the start of 2015, to the album's release on April 21, the official Passion Pit blog released clues to the new song's lyrics and melodies in the form of Morse-encoded lyrics with the track number and time code the lyrics appeared at, and 4 ‚Äì 10 seconds of melody for a select few songs. =2017-present: Tremendous Sea of Love= On March 24 the album Tremendous Sea of Love was self-released. This came one month after the album had been available for free in exchange for retweets of a tweet describing the importance of science and research. The official release of the album was announced on July 11 to be on July 28. Personal life At seven, he started his first band, Dead Grass, and made himself a canvas tote bag as personal merchandise, emblazoned with a painting of a meadow on fire and fake band members lying about. While living in Buffalo, he developed an appreciation for ska, forming a local ska band, Cherry Bing. He also experimented with a number of other musical ventures throughout his years at Nichols School, delving into different musical forms and composition expanding his musical acumen. During this time, he became proficient in putting his musical thoughts directly and quickly into sound. Within one hour, he wrote and recorded the music for a high school play. He performed onstage for that production, which was performed at the Fringe Festival in Scotland. While he attended Emerson College, in the 2000s, he developed a love for opera, the soprano voice, show tunes, and slowcore indie rock, continuing to compose scores for school film majors. Angelakos married Kristina Mucci in 2013. On August 27, 2015, the couple announced that they were divorcing. In the same year, he came out as bisexual. =Mental health= On July 16, 2012, Angelakos posted on the Passion Pit website that the band had canceled the remaining July 2012 tour dates and suspended the tour in order for Angelakos to seek ongoing treatment for bipolar disorder. A Rolling Stone interview stated that Angelakos was diagnosed at 17, and had been receiving therapy, hospital care, and medication ever since. Two days later, Pitchfork ran a cover story explaining the nature of Angelakos' health issues and its ties to Passion Pit's second album. It was revealed he was on suicide watch. On March 4, 2013, The Huffington Post reported about Angelakos' evident recovery as Passion Pit performed a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden on February 8, 2013. The article cited Angelakos as being \\"in one of the best places he's ever been\\". Angelakos, with his company The Wishart Group, together with co-founder Bianca Campuued and neuroscientists David and Michael Wells, is working to bring changes in the music industry with regards to mental health.

According to a 2001 article in the Rock Hill Herald, \\"The driving forces were the White Family and Springs family, prominent planters who realized a need for a better way to move the area's commerce.\\"  Presence in Rock Hill, SC  In the late 1840s, the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad wanted to expand and build a line that went from southern Charlotte to Columbia, SC. The railroad approached the settlers in the small village of Ebenezerville, but they rejected the opportunity to have a railroad station in their town. They believed it would be noisy and dirty and did not want it to disrupt their lives. p. 26 Engineers and surveyors then approached the handful of residents a few miles away near a rocky hill landmark. Those settlers, including the White family, the Black family, and the Moore family, were eager to have the railroad there.Willoughby, p. 27 Those three families gave the railroad the right of way on their properties. The \\"rocky hill\\" landmark was the origin of the eventual city's name of Rock Hill. Businesses were built in the immediate area of the depot, at first to serve the railroad construction workers, but later to serve everyone as the town grew.Willoughby, p. 28 The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. By the 1870s, Ebenezerville, the village that had rejected the depot, was a dying town, while Rock Hill was growing very quickly. A fire in Rock Hill in 1884 destroyed the passenger depot, freight platforms, and storage areas.Willoughby, p. 67 Two replacement depots were built, separating the passenger and freight trains. A second railroad, the Charleston, Cincinnati, and Chicago Railroad came to Rock Hill in 1888, adding two more depots to the town. In 1896, the town finally convinced the two railroads to build one joint depot to increase efficiency and cut down on confusion.Willoughby, p. 69 Between 1909 and 1912, the railroad depot was upgraded to a two-story brick building now owned by the Southern Railway System. American Civil War The line served as a vital railroad connection during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, and was damaged in the waning days of the conflict by General William T. Sherman's troops as they ravaged South Carolina.

It lies west of Highway 27 and east of Interstate 75 in Polk, Lake, Sumter, Hernando and Pasco Counties. The headwaters of the Peace River, Withlacoochee River, Ocklawaha River, and Hillsborough River are located here. Some 110,000 acres of the swamp are managed as the Green Swamp Wilderness Preserve by the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Divided into five management units: Colt Creek State Park ‚Äî 5,067 acres; East Tract ‚Äî 51,149 acres; Hampton Tract ‚Äî 11,052 acres; Little Withlacoochee Tract ‚Äî 4,446 acres; and West Tract ‚Äî 37,350 acres. Nearly 36 miles of the Withlacoochee River‚Äôs 110-mile length are protected as an Outstanding Florida Water within the Green Swamp Wilderness Preserve. As a plateau above surrounding areas, the Green Swamp region is an important physiographic feature of Florida. Its 560,000 acres of wetlands, flatlands and low ridges are bounded by prominent sandy ridgelines. Rainwater drains across the surface to create the headwaters of four major rivers: the Withlacoochee, the Ocklawaha, the Hillsborough and the Peace. Rainwater also trickles down through the soil to replenish the Floridan aquifer system, the primary source of drinking water for most Floridians. Because the Green Swamp region is elevated above outlying areas and the underground aquifer rises very close to the land surface, the region functions as the pressure head for the aquifer. Protecting the Green Swamp is vital to protecting the quality and quantity of Florida‚Äôs water supply. Recognizing the statewide significance of this area, the state of Florida in 1974 designated 322,000 acres of the Green Swamp region as an Area of Critical State Concern.

Early life Verdon was born in Liverpool, England on 19 December 1838Obituary, Dr Verdon, Bishop of Dunedin, Otago Daily Times, Monday, 25 November 1918, p. 8. His father came from County Louth, Ireland and his mother came from County Kildare. He was a nephew of Cardinal Cullen, Archbishop of Dublin, and a first cousin of Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney. Verdon received his early education in Castleknock College, Dublin, conducted by the Vincentian Fathers. In 1855 he proceeded to Rome, where he continued his studies in the Irish College. He was ordained priest on 28 December 1861. Career In 1861, Verdon was appointed a professor in the ecclesiastical seminary of Dublin, the Holy Cross College, Clonliffe, of which nine years later, he became President. He enlarged the buildings there, constructed a \\"magnificent church\\" and considerably improved the quality of the teaching to raise the prestige of the college. In 1879 he was appointed a canon of the Cathedral Chapter, Dublin, by Cardinal MacCabe, Archbishop of Dublin. Verdon then joined the staff of the Irish College in Rome where as vice-rectorER Simmons, A Brief History of the Catholic Church in New Zealand, Catholic Publications Centre, Auckland, 1978, p. 89 he also made improvements and was raised to the dignity of a domestic prelate. In 1888 he was recruited by Cardinal Moran to go to Sydney to take charge of the newly erected St Patrick's College, Manly. Under his rule the number of students rose to 65. At the Provincial Council, held in Sydney, in 1895, he was elected by the Bishops of Australia to represent them, and act as their agent in Rome; and, in February, 1896 when he had reached Melbourne on his way there, Verdon received news of his appointment to the see of Dunedin. Episcopate Verdon was consecrated bishop in St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dunedin, on Sunday, 3 May 1896, by Cardinal Moran, assisted by Archbishop Redwood of Wellington, Bishop Murray of Maitland and Bishop Grimes of Christchurch. It was the first time that a bishop was consecrated in New Zealand.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy OP, Star in the South: The Centennial History of the New Zealand Dominican Sisters, St Dominic's Priory, Dunedin, 1970, p. 156 One of Verdon's first concerns was the establishment of a national seminary in Dunedin and, with the support of the other New Zealand bishops, Holy Cross College, Mosgiel was opened on 3 May 1900, exactly four years after Verdon's consecration and Verdon was himself its first Rector.Peter Joseph Norris, Southernmost Seminary: The story of Holy Cross College, Mosgiel (1900-97), Holy Cross Seminary, Auckland, 1999, p. 15 It was a significant step forward for the Church in New Zealand ensuring an adequate supply of clergy trained in New Zealand and also creating \\"a very real bond between the secular priests of the country\\". On 12 December 1909 Verdon ordained the first six priests from the seminary. In 1911 he celebrated his golden jubilee of the priesthood. During the 22 years of his tenure, Verdon generally went about his work quietly. He took no part in public affairs but confined himself to church matters. He encouraged new schools established by the Dominican sisters. He introduced the Sisters of Mercy in South Dunedin where they established the St Vincent de Paul Orphanage and St Philomena's College. Later they set up many other primary schools in the Dunedin diocese. Verdon also invited the Little Sisters of the Poor to Dunedin to care for the aged poor. Death In 1918, in the midst of the influenza epidemic, Verdon went to Rotorua for health reasons and improved greatly there. However, on the return journey he caught a cold which developed into Bronchitis. He died at St Gerard's Redemptorist Monastery, Wellington on 23 November 1918, aged 79. His remains were brought to Dunedin. Bishop Brodie of Christchurch (who had been a student of Verdon's 28 years before at St Patrick's College, Manly) celebrated the requiem mass and preached the panegyric. Interment Verdon was interred in the Southern Cemetery alongside his predecessor Bishop Moran in the mausoleum erected for the first bishop of Dunedin. There his body remained until 1963 when it was transferred to the chapel built in his memory at Holy Cross College, Mosgiel.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy OP, p. 203 Character and influence In an editorial The Otago Daily Times compared Verdon with his predecessor Patrick Moran. Moran was physically slight but vibrant with \\"mental activity, nervous energy and fiery eloquence\\". Verdon was a large man with a massive frame. But he shunned publicity and was not widely known outside the Catholic community. Verdon's delight was in building new churches, expanding Catholic education and in philanthropy. He had \\"simple tastes, a singularly winning manner, deep sympathies, and profound wisdom\\".\\"Editorial: Bishop Verdon\\", Otago Daily Times, Monday, 25 November 1918, p. 6 Verdon's uncle and mentor, Cardinal Cullen had insisted on complete loyalty to Rome, the pope and the magisterium. He encouraged his priests to wear Roman clerical garb and to decorate their churches \\"in the fashion of contemporaneous Roman basilicas\\". This attitude was inherited by Verdon. He had great reverence for the Italian Catholic Reformation Sants, Philip Neri and Charles Borromeo. He also preferred to send talented seminarians to Rome for further training and he decorated Holy Cross College in a very Roman way.Nicholas Reid, James Liston: A Life, Victoria University Press, Wellington, 2006, p. 35 These attitudes were also transferred to those whom Verdon mentored, including James Liston, the seventh Bishop of Auckland.

The Cremaschi tried to defend their city from the Germans, but were eventually defeated by Frederick Barbarossa's men. Frederick seized Milan in 1162 shortly after he took Crema. These events started the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines, leading to the formation of the Lombard League, a league of northern Italian communes allied against the emperor, supported by the Pope.  Background  In 1158, Frederick Barbarossa led an army into northern Italy to reduce the autonomy of its communes. The main imperial ally, Cremona, was at the time quarreling with the nearby Crema about rights and privileges namely owed to the bishops of Cremona. Crema was also allied to Milan, and this was seen as a menace of extension of the Milanese power towards Cremona and the Po River. In a meeting held at Casale Monferrato, the Cremonesi convinced Frederick to attack Crema, an act that would also imply a menace against the rebellious Milan. The Cremonese also paid 15,000 silver corone to Frederick in exchange of his help. The siege After an ultimatum sent by Frederick on 2 February 1159, asking the destruction of their walls, was refused, the Cremaschi settled into their city to hold against a siege. Barbarossa killed his prisoners, so the Cremese hacked their prisoners to pieces in front of their comrades.Grant, RG: Battle The besieging troops were formed mostly by Barbarossa's imperial contingents, part of which led by his brother, Conrad, and by the latter's son Frederick; by Bavarian troops under duke Henry the Lion; and by communal troops, mostly belonging to the main imperial allies, Cremona (under bishop Oberto of Dovara) and Pavia. The city was on a marshy plain and was protected by several moats and a tall double wall. The defenders had nine mangonels as defensive artillery. Milan attempted to save Crema by assaulting a nearby town, but Barbarossa drove back the Milanese. The besiegers set in their final positions in the October 1159; starting from the following December, they used a \\"cat\\" (a mobile roof), followed by a siege tower, to cover their siege engineers who were mining under the walls. This led to the Cremaschi also digging tunnels to start underground warfare. After the cat had eroded the walls, a ram was used to create a breach in the walls; the tower was further neared to the walls starting from 6 January. The final assault was launched on January 21 using a mobile bridge measuring some 24 x 3.5 meters, while a smaller one was launched from the siege tower. The defenders and the civilians, some of whom had died of hunger and disease, surrendered on January 25 after the imperial troops had taken control of the outer walls. Some 20,000 survivors were allowed to leave with whatever they could carry before Crema was looted and burnt to the ground. An edict issued by Frederick in 1162 at Lodi officially forbade its reconstruction. Milan was also taken and destroyed two years later, ending the first phase of the war. Crema could be rebuilt by its citizens after the signature of the Peace of Constance in 1183.

Career Lucas was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the son of Richard Lucas and his wife, Martha Sutton (who died shortly after childbirth). At the age of twelve, he was apprenticed to an uncle who was a cutler at Winchester, where his ability at carving knife handles revealed his skill as a sculptor. He moved to London, aged 21, and studied at the Royal Academy Schools. From 1828, he was a regular contributor to the Royal Academy, receiving silver medals for architectural drawing in 1828 and 1829. His son Albert D√ºrer was born in 1828 in Bayswater and by 1846 the family was living at Nottingham Place in central London. In 1849, the family moved out of London, probably for health reasons, to Otterbourne, near Winchester, where Lucas may have become a friend of the Victorian children's author, Charlotte Mary Yonge. Lucas then moved to Chilworth near Romsey in about 1854 where he had the \\"Tower of the Winds\\" built to his own design. This house stood opposite the former \\"Clump Inn\\". In 1865, he built a second home, \\"Chilworth Tower\\", about half a mile from the first. By this time, Lucas had become very eccentric, believing in fairies, and rode around Southampton in a Roman chariot. Lucas posing as a \\"Roman\\" in a self-portrait c. 1858 Lucas exhibited over a hundred works at the Royal Academy, the British Institution and at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists; these included busts, medallions and classical subjects. Amongst his statuary are those of Samuel Johnson at Lichfield, Isaac Watts at Southampton and Richard Colt Hoare at Salisbury Cathedral. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"such large works were ill suited to his powers\\". His marble, wax, and ivory medallion portraits were more successful, however; many were displayed at the Great Exhibition and several were subsequently purchased by the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst his works on display at Bodelwyddan Castle are wax medallions of Sir Frederic Madden, Thomas Garnier, Anthony Panizzi and Henry Hallam. Two self-portraits, an etching dated on the plate 1858, and a plaster cast of a bust, incised and dated 1868, are also in the National Portrait Gallery collection. Lucas's popular wax relief Leda and the Swan was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Another copy is held in the National Gallery, Berlin. The Victoria & Albert also has a bust of the London society hostess, Catherine, Lady Stepney, posing as Cleopatra. Lucas was an enthusiastic student of the Elgin Marbles, of which he made two large wax models, the first showing the Parthenon as it appeared after bombardment by the Venetians in 1687; the other representing it restored in accordance with his own theories as to the original arrangement of the sculptures. The latter was exhibited in the Elgin room at the British Museum, where it became the subject of much public interest. In 1845 he published his Remarks on the Parthenon, illustrated with fifteen etchings. Lucas produced many etchings depicting his own sculptural works, biblical stories, and scenes from eighteenth-century poetry. A nearly complete series of these, mounted in an album bound by Lucas himself, and including a frontispiece portrait of the artist, was held the British Museum. These albumen \\"cartes de visite\\" (now in the National Portrait Gallery) show Lucas in a variety of theatrical and expressive poses that further reveal his eccentricity. Towards the end of his life, Lucas's conversational prowess ensured that he was a frequent guest at Broadlands, the seat of Lord Palmerston, who obtained for him a civil-list pension in June 1865. Lucas made three wax portraits of Palmerston, and a statuette which formed his last exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1859. In 1870 he published An Essay on Art. Death Lucas died of paralysis at his home in Chilworth, on 18 May 1883, leaving a widow, Eliza (c.1805‚Äì1893), and a son, Albert D√ºrer Lucas (1828‚Äì1918). Albert was a painter of still-life and flowers who had exhibited at the British Institution and with the Society of Artists between 1859 and 1874. His paintings are still regularly reproduced and sold at auction. The \\"Flora\\" bust The \\"Flora\\" bust Among the objects in the Bode's collection is a bust of Flora, which had been purchased by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, under the belief that it was by Leonardo da Vinci. Wilhelm von Bode, the general manager of the Prussian Art Collections for the Berlin Museum, had spotted the bust in a London gallery and purchased it for a few pounds. Bode was convinced that the bust was by Leonardo, and the Berlin Museum authorities, and the German public, were delighted to have \\"snatched a great art treasure from under the very noses\\" of the British art world. However, in 1910, Albert D√ºrer Lucas ‚Äì the son of Richard Cockle Lucas ‚Äì claimed that the sculpture had been created by his father. Shortly thereafter, The Times ran an article claiming that the bust was the work of Lucas, who had been commissioned to produce it from a painting. Lucas's son Albert then came forward and swore under oath that the story was correct and that he had helped his father to make the sculpture. Albert was able to explain how the layers of wax had been built up from old candle ends; he also described how his father would stuff various debris, including newspapers, inside the bust. When the Berlin museum staff removed the base they found the debris, just as Albert had described it, including a letter dating from the 1840s. Despite this evidence, Bode continued to claim that his original attribution was correct. To support this, he displayed the Flora bust among a selection of Lucas's other works but this exhibition backfired, as it showed that Lucas had been regularly making wax sculptures inspired by the great works of previous times. Hungarian-born London art critic and historian Paul George Konody, in particular, \\"waged war on Dr. Bode's claims through the columns of the London Daily Mail\\".\\"Showing Swindlers in the World of Art Never Lack Victims\\", New York Herald (22 June 1919), p. 72. Various claims and counter-claims have been put forward about the bust, from its being an outright forgery to being a genuine 16th-century piece (albeit not by Leonardo). Scientific examination has been inconclusive and unhelpful in dating the bust, although it is accepted as having at least some connection with Lucas. The bust remains on display in what is now the Bode Museum labelled \\"England\\", \\"19th Century\\" with a question mark.

Andrews was of a good family \\"but inconsiderable estate\\" in Middlesex, was secretary to Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham and a barrister (probably of Lincoln's Inn). Early in the civil war he joined the king's army; but on the surrender of Worcester in 1645, despairing of the success of his cause, he returned to the private practice of his former profession. He did not acknowledge the party in power, either by compounding for his \\"delinquency\\", or by subscription to the covenant and the tests which succeeded it. But his course of life, however retired, could not escape the vigilance of the Puritan rulers, his actions, for years together, being as well known to the council of state \\"as if they had kept a diary for him\\". John Barnard, a major formerly under his command, was his frequent visitor, and \\"obtruded upon his acquaintance\\" two cavaliers, Captain Holmes and John Benson, a copying clerk under Rushworth who proposed to take advantage of the discontent of the dismissed parliamentary officers, and of their repentant desire to serve the young king.  Royalist engagement  It was suggested that Andrews should go to Cambridgeshire, to ascertain whether an old plan of his for the surprise of the Isle of Ely were still feasible; but this project was abandoned on the failure of the royalist movements in Scotland and Ireland. An ordinance having passed that all who had not taken the prescribed tests should leave London, Andrews prepared to quit England, and was in treaty with Sir Edward Plowden for some land in New Albion, when Barnard persuaded him to remain, on pretence of a rising to be headed by \\"persons of quality\\" in Kent, Dorset and Buckinghamshire. Andrews was induced to subscribe this new royalist \\"engagement\\", and to endeavour to draw in Sir John Gell, of Hopton, who was known to be influential and disaffected. But Gell, though protesting his loyalty, was too wary to commit himself; and Andrews, finding that the whole scheme was a delusion, prepared to carry out his former resolution of leaving the country, when he was arrested at Gravesend on 24 March 1650.  Arrest  Barnard had been the spy of the council, and had only delayed the arrest of Andrews that other cavaliers might be, through him, decoyed to a like ruin. On his arrival in London, Andrews was examined by President Bradshaw, Sir Henry Mildmay, and Thomas Scot, with a view of extorting admissions to be used against others. Disappointed in this, they committed him to the Tower of London on a charge of treason in endeavouring to subvert the government; and the evidence of this design was furnished by the \\"Narrative\\" he had himself handed in. Andrews charged Bradshaw with setting spies to trepan him, and Bradshaw acknowledged and defended the practice. Andrews was kept close prisoner for sixteen weeks. As prisoners then had to bear their own expenses, \\"his score for necessaries was swollen beyond his ability to discharge\\", and \\"his friends were not permitted to visit or relieve him\\" (a few persons were allowed to see him on law business only in the presence of the lieutenant).State Papers, Dom. 1650 Having vainly petitioned the council four times for a pardon or a speedy trial, he addressed the same prayer to the parliament. The answer was his arraignment before the high court of justice on 16 August, where the attorney-general, Edmund Prideaux, urged his condemnation on the evidence of his own \\"Narrative\\".  Execution  Andrews demurred to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as a mere court-martial, not a court of record‚Äî'having power only to condemn, not to acquit'‚Äîand established in contravention of Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the promise made by the parliament not to interfere with the ordinary course of justice. Prideaux replied 'that they were not at leisure to take notice of his law cases, but only of his confession,' and the inevitable condemnation followed. Andrews had in the meantime again petitioned parliament, but a resolution was passed (19 August) that his confessions and examination having been transmitted to the high court, \\"it was not fit to interfere further\\". The usual sentence in treason cases was, however, altered to beheading, and he was executed on Tower Hill 22 August 1650. Andrews met his fate with firmness, kissing the axe (probably that used on the king and Lord Capel), hoping to meet his former masters that day in the presence of the Saviour, and thanking those in power for their courtesy in awarding him a mode of death suitable to his quality. He gave the executioner three pounds (¬£3)- all he had ‚Äì as a fee and his last words were, \\"Lord Jesus, receive me!\\". His head was struck off at a blow.  Aftermath  Of the other persons concerned‚ÄîBarnard, rewarded with money and promotion, found his true deserts when, four years later, he was hanged at Tyburn for robbery; Ashley was condemned but pardoned; Benson was hanged; Sir John Gell was found guilty of misprision of treason, and so escaped with life, though his estate was forfeited, and he was imprisoned till April 1653.Athen√¶ Oxon. (ed. Bliss), iii. 561 Some writers have asserted that Andrews, by his demonstration of the illegality of the high court, practically abolished it. But it was too serviceable an instrument to be parted with, and he was by no means its last victim. A detailed account of his death was published by his friend Francis Buckley. It is curious to note that this narrative was reproduced, almost word for word, in a pamphlet professing to relate the particulars of the execution of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby in October 1651.

It is based on the 1981 novel Shuttlecock by Graham Swift. Plot Major James Prentis (Alan Bates) is a British spy of World War II and war hero who goes under the code name of \\"Shuttlecock\\". Alienated from his family and children, he ends up in a mental institution in Lisbon, Portugal, where he eventually decides to publish his memoirs 20 years after the war. His son, John (Lambert Wilson), becomes increasingly alarmed with the enigmatic Dr. Quinn (Kenneth Haigh), the director of the institution, and concludes after reading his father's memoirs that Quinn is responsible for his father's mental decline.

Producer Graham Leader acquired the rights to the film in the late 1980s after a meeting with Graham Swift, the writer of the novel, and paid $7,500 for the rights over two years. Tim Rose Price, the writer of several BBC dramas, agreed to write the script, and worked on a script with Leader throughout 1989. Jon Amiel agreed to direct. Producers Leader and Charles Ardan approached Channel 4 and British Screen to finance the picture; Channel 4 agreed to shout $900,000, payable when the film was completed, and British Screen offered just over $500,000, if Leader could attract a co-producer on the European continent who could finance $1.5 million. Leader had searched for financing in the United States, but was turned down by the likes of Orion Classics and Avenue Pictures, who wanted the characters and settings Americanized. French independent French company Les Productions Belles Rives eventually agreed to partly finance the film. After one of France's largest film labs conceded to provide materials and film- processing services, a shortfall of $225,000 still remained. The film was shot on location in Lisbon, Portugal over six weeks at the end of 1990 and beginning of 1991, with a French, English and Portuguese crew. Producer Leader described the filming for Shuttlecock as \\"highly unorganized chaos\\", and the actors were surrounded with confusion on set. Financing was halted during the filming when a French bank which had loaned the money for production \\"decided to take its fees out of the loan rather than out of the profits from the film\\". To get themselves out of difficulty, producers Leader, Piddington and Rose put half of their fees for it back into the film. A British investor turned up during the filming, promising to provide financing, but a New Zealand heiress froze all of his bank accounts before anything was signed. Filming was wrapped up in January 1991 in London, before post-production began at Pinewood Studios. The total budget eventually amounted to around $3 million. The film was screened at the San Sebastian Film Festival, shortly after a rushed job with adding Spanish subtitles, where it failed to win the $250,000 Golden Shell Award and any others, making it ineligible for Cannes. Further editing to the film over the next six months was done, but the producers failed to attract a distributor. There was optimism for a time that it would be released at the Hamptons International Film Festival, but it amounted to nothing. Financing for the film was eventually derived mainly from Channel 4, Les Productions Belles Rives, and KM Films, and a plethora of other associate producers such as Sea Lion Films, Gigantic Pictures, Minerva Productions, and distributors such as Alliance Communications, Le Monde Entertainment, and Movie Screen Entertainment. Reception The film received a mixed response from critics. Variety praised the film's acting and directing but stated that its \\"theatrical prospects seem iffy.\\" The cinematography of the film was praised by some critics. Sight & Sound magazine wrote that \\"Andrew Piddington approaches his material in a resourceful way.\\" Richard Schickel, the film critic for Time, reportedly approved of the film when he first viewed it, but several years later described it as \\"a bit on the plodding side\\" and as \\"the kind of film that would have two weeks in the theater and then go straight to video.\\" The New York Times considered the film to be a disaster, writing: > \\"Shuttlecock\\" is a film for which things went very wrong. So wrong, in fact, > that it makes a kind of negative case study for anyone thinking of investing > in or producing an independent film. Its troubled history is a whole-earth > catalogue of bad decisions, strategic miscalculations, painful rejections, > misunderstandings and lots of old-fashioned bad luck. It is the film story > that independent producers pray they will never live through. However, when the film was screened on 6 January 1994 on Channel 4 as part of its series \\"Film on Four\\", the Sunday Telegraph named the film its \\"TV Pick of the Week,\\" referring to it as \\"a film with things to say and a muscular yet sensitive way of saying them.\\" The film has been remade under the title \\"Sins of a Father\\", reported the New York Times Feb. 1, 2015.

He was Archbishop of Santiago de Chile from December 2010 to March 2019 and has been a cardinal since February 2014. He previously served as Archbishop of Concepci√≥n. He headed the Episcopal Conference of Chile from 2010 to 2016. Early life and education Ricardo Ezzati was born in Campiglia dei Berici, Vicenza, Italy. He immigrated to Chile in 1959 to enter the novitiate of the Salesians in Quilpu√©, Valpara√≠so, and studied philosophy at the Catholic University of Valpara√≠so. He studied theology at the Pontifical Salesian University in Rome, where he obtained his licentiate. He made his final vows as a Salesian on 30 December 1966 and was ordained as a priest of the Salesian order on 18 March 1970. After his ordination he received a Licentiate in Religious Studies at the Institut de Pastoral Cat√©chetique in Strasbourg. He then held the title of Professor of Religion and Philosophy at the Catholic University of Valpara√≠so. Priesthood As a Salesian priest he held the following positions: Director for Youth Ministry in the Salesian School in Valdivia; Director of Community for the Salesians in Concepcion, Chile; Member of the Provincial Council of the Chilean Salesians; Director of the Salesian Seminary of Santiago de Chile; and Inspector Provincial of the Salesians in Chile. He was a member of the Faculty of Theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and Vice President of the Conference of Religious of Chile, participating in the General Chapters of the Salesian Congregation in 1984 and 1990. Episcopate In 1991, he was appointed to the Roman Curia as an official of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. On 28 June 1996, Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Valdivia, Chile, and he was consecrated on 8 September. Ezzati leaving his installation mass, Santiago de Chile, 14 January 2011 On 10 July 2001, John Paul II appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of the much larger Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile, assigning him the titular see of La Imperial. On 27 December 2006, he was named Archbishop of Concepci√≥n. In June 2009, Pope Benedict XVI named him and four other prelates to serve as Apostolic Visitors to the Legionaries of Christ following the discovery that the order's founder, Marciel Maciel Degollado, an associate of John Paul II, had engaged in sexual abuse of minors and young men. Ezzati was given responsibility for investigating the order in South America: Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela, where the Legion had 20 houses, 122 priests and 122 religious seminarians. While archbishop of Concepci√≥n, Ezzati mediated a dispute between the government and a group of 34 Mapuche prisoners who had been on a hunger strike for 82 days. On 15 December 2010, Pope Benedict appointed Ezzati as Archbishop of Santiago de Chile to replace Cardinal Francisco Err√°zuriz, who had submitted his resignation as required upon reaching the age of 75. Ezzati was installed in Santiago de Chile on 14 January 2011. Pope Francis named Ezzati a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education in November 2013. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal at a consistory on 22 February 2014. In May 2014, Pope Francis named him a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. In October 2014, Ezzati denied press reports that he had denounced the Jesuit priest Felipe Berr√≠os to the Vatican and said he had only replied to inquiries about the priest's controversial statements from the papal nuncio. Press reports later demonstrated that Ezzati had initiated the accusation process to prevent Berr√≠os from becoming chaplain at the presidential palace. He participated in the Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2014 and October 2015. He was one of the four prelates who presented the 2014 synod's summary document (the relatio). He served as president of the Episcopal Conference of Chile from 2010 to 2016. =Karadima case scandal= In February 2011, he announced that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, based on an investigation conducted under his predecessor, had found Fernando Karadima, a prominent priest in the archdiocese, guilty of sexually abusing minors. In 2013 and 2014, he teamed with his predecessor, Cardinal Errazuriz, on a secret campaign to prevent Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima's victims and accusers, from being appointed to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. The revelation of their email correspondence in September 2015 prompted advocates for victims of abuse to call for Ezzati's resignation. Includes the full text of several email messages. In January 2015, Pope Francis named Bishop Juan Barros Madrid to head a diocese. Barros was closely associated with Karadima and continued to defend him. Ezzati's advice that the appointment be withdrawn was not accepted. Ongoing lawsuit On October 21, 2018, reports surfaced that Chile's Court of Appeal ordered Ezzati's office to pay 450 million pesos ($650,000) to three men who claimed that Karadima had sexually abused them for decades.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-church-abuse-chile/chilean-court- orders-catholic-church-to-pay-damages-over-abuse-report-idUSKCN1MV0SP However, Dobra Lusic, a spokesperson for the Court of Appeal, stated that the lawsuit was still ongoing and that no verdict had been reached.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/chilean-court-denies-media- report-of-verdict-in-karadima-lawsuit-33763 Resignation amid new lawsuit A man filed a $500,000 lawsuit against Ezzati and the Archdiocese of Santiago claiming that in 2015 he had been raped in a bedroom attached to the cathedral and that Ezzati had bribed him to keep silent.

Born in Hamburg, Andry spent his formative years in Melbourne, Australia, where he became a professional flautist, with ambitions to be a conductor. After moving to England, where he studied with William Lloyd Webber and Sir Adrian Boult, he played the flute in the orchestra of a ballet company, with occasional chances to conduct. In 1953 he switched career, joining the Decca Record Company as a producer. Less than three years later he moved to Decca's rival, HMV Records, part of the EMI group, where he rose to become head of the group's classical operations. After retiring from EMI in 1988, Andry headed a new classical label Warner Classics, before retiring finally from the recording industry in 1996. Life and career =Early years= Andry was born in Hamburg, the younger of two brothers.\\"Peter Andry\\", The Daily Telegraph, 24 January 2011 His mother was a professional opera singer, his father a lawyer.\\"Peter Andry ‚Äì Unfailingly modest record producer who presided over brilliant performances from Callas, Richter, Klemperer and Karajan\\",The Times, 16 February 2011 When Andry was eight the family moved to Australia, where he studied piano, composition and flute at the University of Melbourne.Millington, Barry. \\"Obituary: Peter Andry\\", The Guardian, 25 January 2011 As a young and inexperienced supernumerary flautist he played under the baton of Otto Klemperer in a much-praised performance of Mahler's Second Symphony.Andry, pp. 73‚Äì75 After freelancing as a player, he joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a music producer, gaining knowledge of the technical side of studio recording. In 1953 Andry won a British Council bursary, and moved to London to study with the composer William Lloyd WebberForeman, Lewis. \\"Peter Andry\\", The Independent, 24 January 2011 and work with the conductors Sir Adrian Boult and Walter Goehr. He played the flute in the orchestra of a touring dance company, the International Ballet, under the baton of a fellow Australian, James Walker, who arranged for him to conduct at some performances. =Decca= The ballet company disbanded within a year of Andry's joining. Walker took up an appointment as a recording producer with Decca Records, and on his recommendation, Andry was recruited to assist Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof. Andry joined the company in 1953 and his first sessions as a recording producer were with Peter Katin in a Liszt recital disc in March 1954.Stuart, Philip. Decca Classical, 1929-2009 accessed 10 January 2012. In the same year he worked with G√©rard Souzay, Sir Adrian Boult, Wilhelm Kempff, Boyd Neel, Julius Katchen and Benjamin Britten. In July and August of that year he supervised the recording, seldom out of the catalogues since, of Edith Sitwell, Peter Pears and the English Opera Group ensemble conducted by Anthony Collins in Sitwell and Walton's Fa√ßade. Andry himself described this recording as \\"perhaps the most famous of Walton's popular entertainment.\\"Andry, p. 82 During the rest of his time with Decca, Andry produced recordings by conductors including Georg Solti, Ernest Ansermet, Rafael Kubel√≠k, Hans Knappertsbusch and Karl B√∂hm, instrumentalists including Karl Richter, Wilhelm Backhaus and the Vienna Octet, and singers including Giuseppe di Stefano, Lisa della Casa and Cesare Siepi. From 1955 Andry worked frequently in Vienna with Olof, who frequently supervised mono recordings while Andry took charge of the simultaneous stereo recordings. Andry admitted that from time to time he would have liked to leave the recording control room and take over from the conductor of the session. On at least one occasion he was able to do so, standing in for Solti at a patching session for a recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the soloist Mischa Elman in April 1955.Andry, p. 12 In the days before John Culshaw persuaded Decca to record the Ring cycle in the studio, it was generally thought that the only practical way of putting Wagner's operas on disc was to tape live performances at the Bayreuth Festival.Culshaw, p. 46 Culshaw himself disliked live recordings, and although his 1951 live Bayreuth Parsifal was hailed as \\"one of the great achievements in the history of the gramophone\\",Sackville- West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 843 he was glad to leave Andry to produce Decca's recordings at the 1955 festival.Culshaw, p. 47 They were The Flying Dutchman and the Ring. The former was released at the time and was not well received.Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"Wagner ‚Äì Der Fliegende Holl√§nder\\", The Gramophone, May 1956, p. 57 For contractual reasons, the Ring could not be released until 2006, when both the performance and recording received high praise.Blyth, Alan. \\"Wagner ‚Äì Siegfried\\", Gramophone, March 2006, p. 95 =EMI= In 1956, Olof left Decca to join its rival HMV to help rebuild its catalogue which was seriously depleted following the dissolution of HMV's partnership with RCA Records.Blyth, Alan. \\"Peter Andry\\", The Gramophone, October 1972, p. 41 He swiftly recruited Andry to join him. HMV was one of the two major classical divisions of the EMI group, both functioning with a considerable degree of autonomy. The other division, Columbia, headed by Walter Legge, was not greatly affected by the split from RCA, as Legge had artists such as Klemperer, Carlo Maria Giulini, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Herbert von Karajan under contract. HMV still had stars such as Sir Thomas Beecham and Yehudi Menuhin on its roster, but artists from the RCA stable such as Arturo Toscanini, Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz whose recordings had previously been released in Britain on the HMV label were now unavailable to EMI. After working successfully in the recording studio in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Andry was promoted to a senior executive position when the older generation of EMI executives retired. Legge left in 1964, and after the retirement of David Bicknell as manager of EMI's International Artistes Department, Andry succeeded to the post. He was later appointed head of EMI's International Classical Division, responsible not only for the group's international recording programme but for its worldwide classical marketing. In The Independent, Lewis Foreman wrote in 2010: Among Andry's most celebrated achievements was to persuade the Soviet authorities to allow David Oistrakh, Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich to record Beethoven's Triple Concerto for EMI in 1969, and capping this by securing Karajan to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic for the recording. In The Gramophone, Edward Greenfield wrote, \\"Even in these days of star-studded casting on record, the line-up for this latest version of the Triple Concerto is nothing short of breathtaking\\".Greenfield, Edward, \\"Beethoven Triple Concerto\\", The Gramophone, September 1970, p. 20 Forty years later, The Times said, \\"even today the performance still elicits superlatives.\\" =Later years= In 1988, Andry left EMI to become president of Warner Classics. Among his notable productions was a recording of Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No.3. That record became one of the biggest selling albums of classical music in the 1990s. Another populist success was the second Three Tenors album, with Pavarotti, Carreras and Domingo, which Andry arranged to record live in Los Angeles in July 1994 at the time of a FIFA World Cup competition, and rush-released within six weeks. Andry retired from the record business in 1996. In 2008 he published a volume of memoirs, Inside the Recording Studio ‚Äì Working with Callas, Rostropovich, Domingo, and the Classical √âlite. Andry died of cancer in St John's Hospice in St John's Wood, London, at the age of 83. Personal life and honours Andry 's first marriage, to Rosemary Macklin, was dissolved and in 1965 he married Christine Sunderland. There were two sons from the first marriage and a daughter from the second. Andry was known for his charity work. Among the causes he worked for were the Music Therapy Charity and the Australian Music Foundation in London. He served on musical councils and bodies including those of the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Royal Society of Arts. For his fund- raising work on behalf of the Royal College of Music he was awarded an honorary Fellowship of the college.

Andrews was the author of a poem called the ‚ÄòAnatomie of Basenesse‚Äô (1615), which was reprinted in the ‚ÄòMiscellanies of the Fuller Worthies' Library‚Äô (vol. ii.). The ‚ÄòAnatomie‚Äô was published with only the initials I. A. in the epistle dedicatory to Sir Robert Sydney, but this epistle guides to the authorship. Apologising for his dedication, the writer says, among other things, that he prints not ‚Äòvaine- gloriously,‚Äô or he would have ‚Äòsubscribed his name,‚Äô and that he forbore to have his name published ‚Äòout of some respects.‚Äô The ‚Äòsome respects‚Äô probably refer to his being a minister of the Gospel; he seems to have held that his satire was too drastic and vehement for a clergyman, and might lay him open to misconstruction. Anthony √† Wood in his ‚ÄòAthen√¶,‚Äô and his editor Dr. Bliss, filled in the initials thus‚Äî‚ÄòI[ohn] A[ndrews]‚Äô‚Äîand wrote of him: > ‚ÄòJohn Andrews, a Somersetshire man born, was entered a student in Trinity > College 1601, aged 18, took one degree in arts [viz.

To this writer we may ascribe a very rare poetical work entitled the ‚ÄúAnatomie of Basenesse.‚Äù‚Äô Sir Richard Hoare, the historian of Wiltshire, makes no mention of Andrews. It would therefore appear that he was curate or assistant or lecturer rather than incumbent. All the religious books of John Andrews have interspersed verses of the same stamp as those to be found in the ‚ÄòAnatomie of Basenesse.‚Äô They include: *‚ÄòAndrewes' Golden Chaine to linke the penitent sinner unto Almighty God‚Äô (1645). *‚ÄòBrazen Serpent ‚Ä¶ at Paules Crosse‚Äô (1621). *‚ÄòConverted Man's New Birth‚Äô (1629). *‚ÄòAndrewes' Repentance, sounding alarum to returne from his sinne unto Almighty God, declaring his repentance.

He was a friend of cabbies, workers, and seamen alike, who took turns at paying his dog licence every year. Paddy was known for greeting sailors in the Wellington Harbour and accompanying them, as a stowaway, on their coastal steamers. Paddy the Wanderer, according to a telephone call made to The Evening Post a day after his death, had been given to the daughter of Mrs. R. Gardner of Wellington by a horse trainer from Christchurch. After the child died, eleven years earlier, the dog ran away. According to Dianne Haworth's 2007 biography, the child had died of pneumonia; after her death, he wandered the Wellington Harbour and occasionally took trips on visiting ships. He had crossed the Tasman Sea many times, and had flown in a Gypsy Moth. He was rumoured to have made it to San Francisco and back. The Wellington Harbour Board adopted him under the formal title of Assistant Night Watchman, whose job it was to keep guard for \\"pirates, smugglers and rodents.\\" Haworth also reports that apparently Paddy had almost fallen victim to a dognapping scheme perpetrated by jealous citizens of Auckland.

The Ladies' auxiliary of the local SPCA took up donations in his name for a memorial. Including Haworth's 1997 Paddy the Wanderer, three biographies of the dog have been published. There is a monument to Paddy on Queens Wharf, opposite the Wellington Museum, including his bronze likeness, a drinking fountain and drinking bowls below for dogs.

It is likely synonymous with the contemporary pteranodontid Pteranodon sternbergi. Variation in cranial anatomy of pteranodonts, Dawndraco in lower left (drawn to scale, unpreserved portions shown in gray) 'Dawndraco' was named by Alexander W.A. Kellner in 2010. The type species is Dawndraco kanzai. The generic name combines the Dawn deity of the Iroquois with a Latin draco, \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to the Kanza tribe of Kansas. 'Dawndraco' is based on the holotype specimen UALVP 24238, a partial skeleton including an almost complete skull and lower jaws. It was recovered in 1974 by Richard C. Fox and Allen Lindoe from rocks of the lower part of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation in Utica, Kansas. These rocks date to the late Coniacian or early Santonian stage, about 86 million years ago. The specimen was earlier referred to Pteranodon sternbergi. However, when Kellner in 2010 assigned this latter species to the genus Geosternbergia, he concluded that specimen UALVP 24238 was too different from it to be accounted for by individual variation or sexual dimorphism and therefore named a separate genus. A unique trait is that the snout does not strongly taper anteriorly as with Pteranodon, the upper and lower margins running almost parallel instead. Kellner further argued that the provenance of the specimen - from rock units between those of other Pteranodon holotypes - supported his interpretation of morphological differences as being taxonomic in nature, rather than relating to growth or gender. 'Dawndraco' was assigned by Kellner to the Pteranodontidae. In a detailed description and discussion of UALVP 24238, Martin-Silverstone et al. (2017) concluded that 'D. kanzai' was not a distinct genus or species from Pteranodon. They showed that its taxonomic characterisations were suspect or erroneous, and that stratigraphic arguments used to further distinguish 'D. kanzai' from other pteranodontids were questionable when compared to the geologic ranges of other Smoky Hill Chalk species. They concluded that UALVP 24238 is better interpreted as a small (not fully osteologically mature) individual of the larger size-class (male) of Pteranodon sternbergi. Their interpretation echoes sceptism expressed about the 2010 Pteranodon revision from other palaeontologists, several of whom have continued to use pre-2010 taxonomies when discussing the Smoky Hill Chalk pteranodonts. In 2014, Andres, Clark, and Xu stated that they would continue to follow the pre-2010 taxonomy of pteranodontids, and referred the new species named by Kellner, including Dawndraco, back to their original classifications following Bennett.

Kunpengopterus is known from holotype IVPP V16047, an almost complete skeleton with complete skull and lower jaws recovered from rocks of the Tiaojishan Formation or Daohugou Beds in Linglongta, Jianchang County, western Liaoning. The age of these layers is controversial. This compression fossil is of an adult individual. Aside from the bones some soft parts were also preserved and the remains of a possibly regurgitated fish. Skull of the referred specimen Kunpengopterus was named and described by Wang Xiaolin, Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner, Jiang Shunxing, Cheng Xin, Meng Xi and Taissa Rodrigues in 2010. The type species is Kunpengopterus sinensis. The generic name combines the Kun, a large fish or whale from Chinese folklore that could transform itself into the Peng, a gigantic colourful bird providing a mythological explanation of the northern lights, with a Latinised Greek pteron, \\"wing\\".

The cervical vertebrae too are relatively long. The naris is confluent with the antorbital fenestra, but these large openings are still partly separated by a broad and anteriorly directed processus nasalis which has itself a small vertical tear- shaped opening. A low bony crest is present on the skull, just behind the eyes; preserved soft tissue shows it was elongated by cartilage and a yellow discolouration indicates it was perhaps enlarged to the back by a skin flap. There is no sign of a crest on the snout or of a keel under the lower jaws. The back of the skull is rounded. Kunpengopterus has a long stiff tail. The fifth toe is also long and strongly curved.

Biography Angel was from Gloucestershire, born towards the end of the sixteenth century. He was admitted of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1610. He proceeded to his degrees of B.A. and M.A. He was ordained in holy orders; at a bound became a frequent and popular preacher, and many puns were made on his name. He does not appear to have been presented to any living but to have gone about as an evangelist. In 1629, or earlier, Francis Higginson declined an appointment as town-preacher at Leicester because of his growing nonconformity. Angel, who then conformed to the establishment, was put in his stead by ‚Äòthe mayor of Alderney,‚Äô and he is found in 1630 as a lecturer. In 1634, he was suspended by the dean of Arches for preaching without licence; an ordinary minister was not allowed to preach without a licence issued by the bishop of the diocese. With relation to Angel's suspension William Laud wrote in his Diary: \\"In Leicester the dean of the Arches suspended one Mr. Angell, who had continued a lecturer in that great town for these divers years without any licence at all to preach, yet took liberty enough. I doubt his violence hath cracked his brain, and do therefore use him more tenderly, because I see the hand of God hath overtaken him.\\" The biographer Samuel Clarke wrote that Angel was subject to great spiritual darkness, but Richard Vines relieved and comforted him. In 1650, at Leicester, Angel differed with the Independents and refused to sign the engagement. The Mercers' Company of London stepped in to relieve him. They appointed him as lecturer at Grantham, Lincolnshire, and he remained there until his death in 1655. Anthony √† Wood quotes the tributes that contemporaries paid him.

The river flows north a short distance, then west between Sams Ridge, to the north, and Matheny Ridge, to the south. Along the way the river leaves the national park and enters Olympic National Forest. For several miles the national park and forest boundary runs along the crest of Sams Ridge. At the western end of the ridge, where the Olympic Mountains open up into broader valleys, the boundary follows Sams River. The boundary turns south near the mouth of Sams River, leaving the final half mile or so within the national park. Sams River joins the Queets River just upstream from Queets Campground, located near Sams Rapids on the Queets River. The Queets Ranger Station is located about a mile downstream from Sams River.Course information mainly from ACME Mapper and Washington Road & Recreation Atlas, by Benchmark Maps. Name The origin of the river's name is not certain. There are two stories about it. According to one story the name comes from Harry and Sam Sams, who were members of an important Quinault family. Every autumn they poled their dugout canoes up the Queets River to Sams Rapids and the mouth of Sams River, where they hunted elk and caught salmon, which they smoked and sold to settlers. Some historians think the name is derived from the word sams or samis, a shortened form of Samms-mish, a prominent Quinault tribal group which once lived along Sams River.

Georgia's attendance at the meeting was opposed by Russia, and therefore the former was not present. Resolution =Observations= In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council stressed that the lack of progress on a settlement between the two parties was unacceptable. It condemned the shooting down of an UNOMIG helicopter in October 2001 which resulted in nine deaths and deplored that the perpetrators of the attack had not been identified. The contributions of UNOMIG and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping forces in the region were welcomed, in addition to the United Nations-led peace process. =Acts= The Security Council welcomed political efforts to resolve the situation, in particular the \\"Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi\\" to facilitate negotiations between Georgia and Abkhazia. It regretted the lack of progress on political status negotiations and the refusal of Abkhazia to discuss the document, further calling on both sides to overcome their mutual mistrust. The Council's position on elections in Abkhazia, described in 1255 (1999), was reaffirmed. All violations of the 1994 Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces were condemned. The Council also welcomed the calm in the Kodori Valley and the signing of a protocol by both parties on 2 April 2002. Concerns of the civilian population were noted and the Georgian side was asked to guarantee the safety of UNOMIG and CIS troops in the valley. Greater efforts to improve security in the Gali region were encouraged. The resolution urged the two parties to revitalise the peace process, including greater participation on issues relating to refugees, internally displaced persons, economic co-operation and political and security matters. It also reaffirmed the unacceptability of demographic changes resulting from the conflict. Abkhazia in particular was called upon to improve law enforcement, address the lack of instruction to ethnic Georgians in their first language and ensure the safety of returning refugees. The Council called again on both parties to take measures to identify those responsible for the shooting down of an UNOMIG helicopter in October 2001. Both parties were also asked to dissociate themselves from military rhetoric and demonstrations in support of illegal armed groups, and ensure the safety of United Nations personnel. Furthermore, there were concerns about the security of UNOMIG personnel, with repeated abductions of UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping personnel, which the Council condemned. Finally, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to report on the situation in Abkhazia within three months.

The park is . History The park was acquired in 1954 by a Department of Army lease, which extended it until 2004. Texas Power and Light Company (now known as Luminant) constructed a dam at Big Brown Creek to impound water as a cooling source for the nearby Big Brown Power Plant. The dam was completed in 1969. The park was opened to the public in 1976. In the early 1830s, the area was important to Anglo settlers, particularly as a route to Texas and the American southwest. It was also an area of cattle trails. There are several historical locations in the park, including an historical marker located in the Chancellor Union Cemetery on the park property. This has the graves of many early settlers from the area, including Civil War, WWI, and WWII veterans. The cemetery is still actively used but not maintained by the park. In the Springfield camp loop is an old well left over from the Hill family homestead. Recreation The park offers nature programs throughout the year.https://www.facebook.com/FairfieldLakeSP/ It has facilities for picnicking, nature study, hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, paddle boarding, swimming, boating, tubing, jet skiing, water skiing, wildlife observation, horseback trails, wildlife photography, group events, RV camping, tent camping, and primitive camping.

It is an appointment, not a military rank. Military drum majors utilize a ceremonial mace for giving commands while marching. In a pipe band, the drum major may be replaced with a pipe major, who serves exactly the same purpose. By country Israel Defense Forces Orchestra drum major =Australia= The Australian Army traditionally styles the appointments along the same lines as the British Army. The drum major is usually an experienced member of the Australian Army Band Corps, although drum majors in regimental pipes and drums are typically members of the Royal Australian Infantry Corps. Drum majors generally have the rank of a senior NCO. However, capability is the main qualification for appointment: the most senior or highest-ranked member of the unit is not always the drum major. =Canada= The Canadian Armed Forces do not require the drum major to be a drummer. Being a former British dominion, a lot of the Canadian drum major tradition is inspired by the British Army. It is also influenced by French and American army music traditions and is an essential part the Canadian Forces drum major drill. =Indonesia= Indonesian drum majors have a tradition that is a mix of Dutch, American, and British influences. Drum majors in the Indonesian National Armed Forces and Indonesian National Police are also not required to be drummers. In the military and police academies, where the drum majors change yearly, the only requirement is that they are cadet sergeant majors or cadet staff sergeant majors. In civil and police bands, there are one to six drum majors that serve alongside the director of music. The military and police drum majors wear full dress or service uniforms at the head of their formations in parades. =Russia= In the Russian Armed Forces, drum majors () are commissioned officers, since they also serve as band leaders and conductors. They are not required to be drummers, but must have long experience as a military bandsman. The title was introduced in 1815 by the Imperial Russian Army. The uniform consisted of gold/silver galloons and a pair of epaulettes. The title was abolished in 1865 only for army regiments and would be reintroduced for the Red Army in 1918. The position would be toned down until after World War Two, when they gained more significance. The Soviet Armed Forces made sure that the Soviet (and later Russian) model for drum majors could be differentiated with the Western version. The Russian model has been used in almost all former Soviet republics (the Baltics, Georgia and Ukraine being the exception). A drum major during the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade. All Russian drum majors are trained in military music schools and institutes like the Moscow Military Music College and the College of Military Music and the Institute of Military Band Conductors of the Military University of the Ministry of Defence, who graduate from these with the rank of lieutenant and during parades carry maces with either the service or full dress uniform. =United Kingdom= In the British Army and Royal Marines Band Service, a drum major holds the rank of sergeant, staff sergeant/colour sergeant, or warrant officer class 2. The Corps Drum Major RM and the Senior Drum Major Army hold the rank of warrant officer class 1. Royal Marines drum majors are now always drawn from the buglers branch and always started their careers as a side drummer (titled \\"bugler\\" in the Royal Marines, as RM drummers are taught to play the bugle and herald trumpets as well as the drums) and are required to have passed a number of courses in music, military skills, and leadership throughout their military careers before being considered for an appointment as a drum major. Drum majors in Army regimental corps of drums are always drummers, but drum majors in the Corps of Army Music are not required to be, the appointment being held by any suitably qualified musician (including a drummer). Royal Air Force drum majors hold the rank of sergeant, chief technician, or flight sergeant (with the Senior Drum Major RAF being a warrant officer), and are not required to be drummers. The insignia of appointment is four point-up chevrons worn on a wrist-strap whilst in shirt-sleeve order, or four large point-up chevrons worn on the uniform sleeve, surmounted by a drum. In the British Army, staff sergeants/colour sergeants have a small crown above the drum, whilst warrant officers class 2 have a larger crown and warrant officers class 1 wear the royal arms as usual. Since the drum major is part of the battalion staff, he wears a crimson sash instead of scarlet, and dresses as a warrant officer regardless of his rank. He is always referred to and addressed as \\"Drum Major\\" or \\"Sir\\" and not by his rank. In the RAF, a chief technician wears a four- bladed propeller above the drum, a flight sergeant wears a crown, and a warrant officer wears the royal arms. Royal Marines drum majors do not wear any additional badges to indicate specific rank. =United States= Staff Sergeant Kady Miller leads the III Marine Expeditionary Forces Band as drum major in the 75th Anniversary Liberation of Guam Parade on Guam in 2019. Drum majors were first introduced when the North American continent was colonized in the 17th century, with drum majors being the standard in fife and drum corps by 1775. The United States Armed Forces does not require the drum major to be a drummer, however they must have a knowledge of music and have the ability to teach all aspects of drill and ceremony. The appointment of drum major falls to senior level NCOs with the rank of staff sergeant onwards. Drum majors in the military's premier ensembles wear bearskin hats when on parade. = Venezuela = The duty of drum major within the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela is only present in the corps of drums of military formations and not in military bands. History A Tambour-Major of the French Imperial Guard (historical reenactment) The position of drum major originated in England with the corps of drums in 1650. Military groups performed mostly duty calls and battle signals during that period, and a fife and drum corps, directed by the drum major, would execute short pieces to communicate to field units. With the arrival of military concert bands and pipe bands around the 18th century, the position of the drum major was adapted to those ensembles. Traditionally, a military drum major was responsible for: * Defending the drummers and bandsmen (The drums and bugles were communication devices) * Military discipline of all corps of drums and pipe band members * Overall standards of dress and deportment of the corps of drums and the pipe band * Corps of drums administrative work * Maintain the corps of drums' standard of military drill, and choreograph marching movements The drum major was also given duties in the battalion at several points in history, which included the administering of military justice (lashing), to any member of the battalion, and collecting the battalion's post. In addition to the duties above, The British Army also included a royal appointment of Drum Major General, whose duties included inspecting all other field music as well as (per The Drummer's Handbook) granting drummers licences, without which one would not be recognised as a drummer. This position was discontinued in the 18th century. Tasks The main task of a military drum major is to control the tempo that the band plays at as well as set the marching pace. A secondary role may be conducting the music of the appropriate music for the band. Another major task for drum majors is giving certain drill commands to the entire to denote whether to turn to the left or right, perform a counter march or mark time, or halt and cut off the music. Depending on the size of the band, there may be up to four drum majors on hand, with one serving as the senior drum major. In a massed bands formation which involves multiple bands, there may be 10-12 drum majors present, with either one or two bearing the duty as senior drum major. In the British Armed Forces, every band only has a single drum major; where massed bands are present, one will act as senior drum major. All drum majors use a ceremonial mace to give commands while marching and performing.

It began to appear in the first decade of the 2nd century BC as an alternative to the victoriatus, and most numismatists believe that it was not used before 190 BC.Cosmo Rodewald, Money in the Age of Tiberius (Manchester University Press, 1976), p. 142. A denarius with a four- horse chariot (quadriga) had already been in use for some time; see quadrigatus, likewise named for its chariot icon and depicting in addition the Dioscuri.Pliny, Natural History 33.46, and Festus, entry on grave aes, Excerpta Pauli, p. 98 (in the edition of M√ºller = p. 87 in the 1997 Teubner edition of Lindsay) both state that the names bigatus and quadrigatus come from the respective icons of the biga and the quadriga, as cited by Rodewald, Money in the Age of Tiberius. The first bigatus depicted Luna in her two-horse chariot. It continued in use along with the Dioscuri quadrigatus until 170 BC, when the denarius was temporarily suppressed. It was revived around 157 BC with the Dioscuri type and a new bigatus depicting Victory in her biga, probably to commemorate Rome's dominance following the Battle of Pydna.Michael H. Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage (Cambridge University Press, 1974), pp. 720‚Äì721. Tacitus and Plutarch mention a statue of Victory in a biga.Tacitus, Histories 1.86; Plutarch, Life of Otho 4. The date at which the bigatus began to be issued is complicated by the uncertain usage of the word bigati by the Augustan historian Livy. In writing about the events of 216 BC, before bigati are known to have come into circulation, Livy uses the word to refer to silver money taken as spoils in Cisalpine Gaul or Hispania, and then displayed at triumphs between 197 and 190 BC.Livy, 23.15.5. Bigati may be used loosely for denarii, and not the specific type.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, p. 630. It has also been conjectured that bigatus had become a slang term for denarii in a broader sense of \\"two-horsed,\\" which might also apply to the image of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) as horsemen.Rodewald, Money in the Age of Tiberius, p. 142, summarizing H. Mattingly, \\"The First Age of Roman Coinage,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 35 (1945); Kenneth W. Hart, Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), pp. 394, note 34, and 475. None of these explanations has been universally satisfying.Rodewald, Money in the Age of Tiberius, p. 142. In his ethnography Germania, Tacitus (56‚Äì117 AD) notes that while most Germanic peoples in his day still relied on barter, those along the borders of the Empire engaged in commerce and used currency, but trusted only the value of \\"old and well-known\\" coins such as bigati and serrati, the latter being those with serrated edges.Tacitus, Germania 5. Since plated coins had begun to circulate during the time of Julius Caesar and after (see fourr√©e), they had cause to be wary; however, other older coins should also have relieved them of their concerns, and the reasons for their preference are unclear, especially since plated bigati existed.Rodewald, Money in the Age of Tiberius, pp. 31, 100 (note 217), 142‚Äì143.

However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees. The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago). Overall, they make up a very small portion of the total sedimentary record. Iron-rich sedimentary rocks have economic uses as iron ores. Iron deposits have been located on all major continents with the exception of Antarctica. They are a major source of iron and are mined for commercial use.Boggs Jr., Sam, 2006, Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th ed.), Pearson Education Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ, pp. 217‚Äì223 The main iron ores are from the oxide group consisting of hematite, goethite, and magnetite. The carbonate siderite is also typically mined. A productive belt of iron formations is known as an iron range. Classification The accepted classification scheme for iron-rich sedimentary rocks is to divide them into two sections: ironstones and iron formations =Ironstones= Ironstones consist of 15% iron or more in composition. This is necessary for the rock to even be considered an iron-rich sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to 540 million years ago. They can contain iron minerals from the following groups: oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are limonite, hematite, and magnetite. An example of a mineral in iron-rich rock containing carbonates is siderite and an example of minerals in an iron-rich rock containing silicate is chamosite.Jackson, Julia A., 1997, Glossary of Geology, American Geologic Institute, Ventura Publisher, Alexandria, VA, pp. 335‚Äì336 They are often interbedded with limestones, shales, and fine-grained sandstones. They are typically nonbanded, however they can be very coarsely banded on occasion. They are hard and noncherty. The components of the rock range in size from sand to mud, but do not contain a lot of silica. They are also more aluminous. They are not laminated and sometimes contain ooids. Ooids can be a distinct characteristic though they are not normally a main component of ironstones. Within ironstones, ooids are made up of iron silicates and/or iron oxides and sometimes occur in alternating laminae. They normally contain fossil debris and sometimes the fossils are partly or entirely replaced by iron minerals. A good example of this is pyritization. They are smaller in size and less likely to be deformed or metamorphosed than iron formations.Middleton, Gerard V. (and others), 2003, Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands, pp. 124‚Äì125, 130‚Äì133, 159‚Äì160, 367‚Äì368, 376‚Äì384, 486‚Äì489, 555‚Äì557, 701‚Äì702 The term iron ball is occasionally used to describe an ironstone nodule. = Iron formations = 213x213px Iron formations must be at least 15% iron in composition, just like ironstones and all iron-rich sedimentary rocks. However, iron formations are mainly Precambrian in age which means that they are 4600 to 590 million years old. They are much older than ironstones. They tend to be cherty, though chert can not be used as a way to classify iron formations because it is a common component in many types of rocks. They are well banded and the banding can be anywhere from a few millimeters to tens of meters thick. The layers have very distinct banded successions that are made up of iron rich layers that alternate with layers of chert. Iron formations are often associates with dolomite, quartz-rich sandstone, and black shale. They sometimes grade locally into chert or dolomite. They can have many different textures that resemble limestone. Some of these textures are micritic, pelleted, intraclastic, peloidal, oolitic, pisolitic, and stromatolitic. In low-grade iron formations, there are different dominant minerals dependent on the different types of facies. The dominant minerals in the oxide facies are magnetite and hematite. The dominant minerals in the silicate facies are greenalite, minnesotaite, and glauconite. The dominant mineral in the carbonate facies is siderite. The dominant mineral in the sulfide facies is pyrite. Most iron formations are deformed or metamorphosed simply due to their incredibly old age, but they still retain their unique distinctive chemical composition; even at high metamorphic grades. The higher the grade, the more metamorphosed it is. Low grade rocks may only be compacted while high grade rocks often can not be identified. They often contain a mixture of banded iron formations and granular iron formations. Iron formations can be divided into subdivisions known as: banded iron formations (BIFs) and granular iron formations (GIFs). The above classification scheme is the most commonly used and accepted, though sometimes an older system is used which divides iron-rich sedimentary rocks into three categories: bog iron deposits, ironstones, and iron formations. A bog-iron deposit is iron that formed in a bog or swamp through the process of oxidation. Banded iron formations vs. granular iron formations alt= = Banded iron formations = Banded iron formations (BIFs) were originally chemical muds and contain well developed thin lamination. They are able to have this lamination due to the lack of burrowers in the Precambrian. BIFs show regular alternating layers that are rich in iron and chert that range in thickness from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The formation can continue uninterrupted for tens to hundreds of meters stratigraphically. These formations can contain sedimentary structures like cross-bedding, graded bedding, load casts, ripple marks, mud cracks, and erosion channels. In comparison to GIFs, BIFs contain a much larger spectrum of iron minerals, have more reduced facies, and are more abundant. BIFs are divided into type categories based on the characteristics related to the nature of their formation and unique physical and chemical properties. Some categories of banded iron formations are the Rapitan type, the Algoma type, and the Superior type. alt=  Rapitan type  Rapitan types are associated with the glaciogenic sequences of the Archean and Early Proterozoic. The type is distinctive as the hydrothermal-input has notably less influence on this formation's Rare Earth Element (REE) chemistry than other formations during this time period.  Algoma type  Algoma types are small lenticular iron deposits that are associated with volcanic rocks and turbidites.Stow, Dorrik Av, 2005, Sedimentary Rocks in the Field, Academic press - Manson Publishing, London, UK, p. 218 Iron content in this class type rarely exceeds 1010 tons. They range in thickness from 10-100 meters. Deposition occurs in island arc/back arc basins and intracratonic rift zones.  Superior type  Superior types are large, thick, extensive iron deposits across stable shelves and in broad basins. Total iron content in this class type exceeds 1013 tons. They can extend to over 105 kilometers2. Deposition occurs in relatively shallow marine conditions under transgressing seas. =Granular iron formations= Granular iron formations (GIFs) were originally well-sorted chemical sands. They lack even, continuous bedding that takes the form of discontinuous layers. Discontinuous layers likely represent bedforms that were generated by storm waves and currents. Any layers that are thicker than a few meters and are uninterrupted, are rare for GIFs. They contain sand-sized clasts and a finer grained matrix, and generally belong to the oxide or silicate mineral facies. Depositional environment Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise There are four facies types associated with iron-rich sedimentary rocks: oxide-, silicate-, carbonate-, and sulfide- facies. These facies correspond to water depth in a marine environment. Oxide- facies are precipitated under the most oxidizing conditions. Silicate- and carbonate-facies are precipitated under intermediate redox conditions. Sulfide-facies are precipitated under the most reducing conditions. There is a lack of iron-rich sedimentary rocks in shallow waters which leads to the conclusion that the depositional environment ranges from the continental shelf and upper continental slope to the abyssal plain. (The diagram does not have the abyssal plain labeled, but this would be located to the far right of the diagram at the bottom of the ocean).Harnmeijer, Jelte P., 2003, Banded Iron- Formations: A Continuing Enigma of Geology, University of Washington, WA, USA Water colored by oxidized iron, Rio Tinto, Spain Iron bacteria growing on iron-rich water seeping from a tall bluff, Sipsey Wilderness Area, Bankhead National Forest, Alabama Chemical reactions Ferrous and ferric iron are components in many minerals, especially within sandstones. Fe2+ is in clay, carbonates, sulfides, and is even within feldspars in small amounts. Fe3+ is in oxides, hydrous, anhydrous, and in glauconites.Pettijohn, Potter, and Siever, 1987, Sand and Sandstone, Springer-Verlag Publishing Inc., New York, NY, pg. 50-51 Commonly, the presence of iron is determined to be within a rock due to certain colorations from oxidation. Oxidation is the loss of electrons from an element. Oxidation can occur from bacteria or by chemical oxidation. This often happens when ferrous ions come into contact with water (due to dissolved oxygen within surface waters) and a water-mineral reaction occurs. The formula for the oxidation/reduction of iron is: : Fe2+ ‚Üî Fe3+ \\\\+ e‚àí The formula works for oxidation to the right or reduction to the left. Fe2+ is the ferrous form of iron. This form of iron gives up electrons easily and is a mild reducing agent. These compounds are more soluble because they are more mobile. Fe3+ is the ferric form of iron. This form of iron is very stable structurally because its valence electron shell is half filled.Leeder, Mike, 2006, Sedimentology and Sedimentary Basins, Blackwell Publishing, Malden, MA, pp. 20‚Äì21, 70‚Äì73 =Laterization= Laterization is a soil forming process that occurs in warm and moist climates under broadleaf evergreen forests. Soils formed by laterization tend to be highly weathered with high iron and aluminium oxide content. Goethite is often made from this process and is a major source of iron in sediments. However, once it is deposited it must be dehydrated in order to come to an equilibrium with hematite. The dehydration reaction is: :2HFeO2 ‚Üí Fe2O3 \\\\+ H2O Pyritized Lytoceras =Pyritization= Pyritization is discriminatory. It rarely happens to soft tissue organisms and aragonitic fossils are more susceptible to it than calcite fossils. It commonly takes place in marine depositional environments where there is organic material. The process is caused by sulfate reduction which replaces carbonate skeletons (or shells) with pyrite (FeS2). It generally does not preserve detail and the pyrite forms within the structure as many microcrystals. In freshwater environments, siderite will replace carbonate shells instead of pyrite due to the low amounts of sulfate.Parrish, J. Michael, 1991, The Process of Fossilization, Belhaeven Press, Oxford, UK, pp. 95‚Äì97 The amount of pyritization that has taken place within a fossil may sometimes be referred to as degree of pyritization (DOP). Oolitic Hematite, Clinton, Oneida County, NY =Iron minerals= *Ankerite (Ca(Mg,Fe)(CO3)2) and siderite (FeCO3) are carbonates and favor alkaline, reducing conditions. They commonly occur as concretions in mudstones and siltstones. *Pyrite and marcasite (FeS2) are sulfide minerals and favor reducing conditions. They are the most common in fine-grained, dark colored mudstones. *Hematite (Fe2O3) is usually the pigment in red beds and requires oxidizing conditions. *Limonite (2Fe2O3¬∑3H2O) is used for unidentified massive hydroxides and oxides of iron.Collison, J.D., 1989, Sedimentary Structures, The University Printing House, Oxford, Great Britain, pp. 159‚Äì164 Limonite, USGS Iron‚Äìrich rocks in thin section Thin section of rhyolite volcanic rock showing an oxidized iron matrix (orange/brown color) Magnetite and hematite are opaque under the microscope under transmitted light. Under reflected light, magnetite shows up as metallic and a silver or black color. Hematite will be a more reddish- yellow color. Pyrite is seen as opaque, a yellow-gold color, and metallic.Scholle, Peter, 1979, Constituents, Textures, Cements, and Porosities of Sandstones and Associated Rocks, The American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Tulsa, OK, pp. 43‚Äì45 Chamosite is an olive-green color in thin section that readily oxidizes to limonite. When it is partially or fully oxidized to limonite, the green color becomes a yellowish-brown. Limonite is opaque under the microscope as well. Chamosite is an iron silicate and it has a birefringence of almost zero. Siderite is an iron carbonate and it has a very high birefringence. The thin sections often reveal marine fauna within oolitic ironstones. In older samples, the ooids may be squished and have hooked tails on either end due to compaction.Adams, A.E., MacKenzie, W.S., and Guilford, C., 1984, Atlas of Sedimentary Rocks Under the Microscope, William Clowes Ltd., Essex, Great Britain, pp. 78‚Äì81 References Sedimentary rocks Iron ores ","title":"Iron-rich sedimentary rocks"},{"id":"30066485","text":"Grasshopper when re-rigged as a Ship Sloop in 1822 HMS Grasshopper was a Royal Navy 18-gun Cruizer-class brig sloop launched in 1813. She was the second ship of the class to bear the name; the first had been stranded at Texel and surrendered to the Batavian Republic on Christmas Day 1811. The present Grasshopper remained in service until sold in 1832. She then became a whaler in the Southern Whale Fisheries, making four voyages between 1832 and 1847. Service Grasshopper was commissioned in May 1813 under Commander Henry Battersby. On 6 October 1813, Grasshopper recaptured the Dryades, Humphries, Master. Dryades had been sailing from Dublin to London when she was captured. After Grasshopper recaptured Dryades, Dryades arrived at Portsmouth on 7 October.Lloyd's List n¬∞4811 - accessed 30 August 2019. In January 1814 Grasshopper sailed to the Mediterranean. On 29 April and 18 May 1815, she captured the Maruccia, Madonna del Montalleggro, and the Immaculata Concezione. Another report expands on this, crediting Grasshopper with detaining the Concession, sailing from Gallipoli, Apulia to Marseilles, the Madame de Monte Allegro, from Naples, the Majorca, from Naples, the Concizione, from Capo Danza and Messina to Naples, and the Concizime, from Leghorn and Civitavecchia to Naples.Lloyd's List n¬∞4995 - accessed 30 August 2019. Unfortunately, Grasshopers prize agents, Messers Lark and Woodhead, went bankrupt in 1816. As a result, the last of the prize money from these captures did not arrive until 1850, and then was minor. Commander Sir Charles Burrard assumed command in or prior to May 1814. More importantly, on 13 May was part of the squadron that was present at the surrender of Naples during the Neapolitan War, though she herself was not actually there. A British squadron, consisting of Grasshopper, the 74-gun , the frigate Alcmene, and the sloop blockaded the port and destroyed all the gunboats there. Parliament voted a grant of ¬£150,000 to the officers and men of the squadron for the property captured at the time, the grant being paid in 1816. Initially, Grasshopper was excluded from the payment as she was not actually present, having been sent on an errand. However, Sir Charles Burrard sued and eventually the court agreed that there had been a blockade and that Grasshopper had been part of the blockade and so was entitled to share in the grant. The money was paid in May 1819, with the officers and crew of the other three vessels being required to repay part of their grant. Grasshopper was paid off in February 1816 and went into Ordinary. She then spent 1816 and 1817 in Portsmouth. Between January and May 1818 she underwent fitting for sea at Portsmouth. Commander Henry Forbes commissioned her, but in May Commander James Buchan took command for the Newfoundland Station. From 1818 she was assigned to the North America Station, being based at Halifax and Newfoundland. From May 1819 her captain was Commander David Buchan, and in her he carried out an assignment from the Governor, Sir Charles Hamilton, to return the native woman Demasduwit to her people, the Beothuks. Although she died of tuberculosis before the mission could be accomplished, he transported her body to a Beothuk camp by ascending the Exploits River in January 1820. Seeing signs of the Beothuk, but meeting none, they left her body and possessions in a tent by Red Indian Lake and returned to Grasshopper by the end of February. Between January and June 1822 Grasshopper was in Portsmouth where the Navy converted her to a ship-sloop. In December 1823 Commander John Alpin took command for the Halifax station. On 30 March 1824, Grasshopper collided with the British merchant ship Industry at Falmouth, Cornwall, England; Industry sank with the loss of one member of her crew. On 23 December 1826 Commander Courtenay Edward William Boyle assumed command while Grasshopper was at Halifax. Between June 1827 and February 1828 Grasshopper was at Woolwich undergoing repairs and fitting for sea. Commander Abraham Crawford commissioned her on 8 December 1827 for Jamaica. From 1828 to 1830 Grasshopper served on the West Indies Station, based in Jamaica. There she was involved in suppressing the slave trade. On 27 June 1828 she captured Xerxes. Admiral Fleeming had ordered Crawford to patrol Cuba's northwest coast and it was there that Grasshoper encountered Xerxes. Xerxes was armed with one 18-pounder gun, four smaller guns, and her 44-man crew was well supplied with small arms. She had sailed with 426 slaves, of whom 406 were still alive. Grasshopper chased Xerxes for 26 hours before capturing her in the Gulf of Mexico; Grasshopper then took her into Havana where British and Spanish Mixed Court condemned (confiscated) the vessel and nominally freed the now 401 surviving slaves on 12 July. On 22 November Grasshopper captured Firme, which was carrying 487 slaves when Grasshopper captured her, having started out from the Gold Coast with 492. Firme had a crew of 43 men, four passengers, and was armed with six guns, four 18-pounders, one 12-pounder, and one 24-pounder.British and Foreign State Papers, (1830), pp.109-111. She too went into Havana and was condemned on 18 December. Crawford received promotion to post-captain in the hospital ship , which was at Port Royal, Jamaica, on 5 January 1829; he invalided back to Britain on 3 April in the yacht Herald later that year.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.77. Commander Charles Deane assumed command of Grasshopper on 5 January 1829. Commander John Elphinstone Erskine replaced him on 3 May 1830. Disposal: The Navy paid off Grasshopper on 6 September 1831. The Admiralty offered Grasshopper for sale at Portsmouth on 30 May 1832. She was sold on that day to Thomas Ward for ¬£910. Whaler Grasshoper underwent a large repair in 1832.

In 1939, he published pamphlets as \\"chairman of the American Federation of Peace\\" that argued that Americans should be sterilized so that their children will no longer have to fight in foreign wars. In 1941, he wrote and published Germany Must Perish! which called for the sterilization of the German people and the distribution of the German lands. The text was used extensively in Nazi propaganda, often as a justification for the persecution of Jews and was specifically cited as a reason to round up the Jews of Hanover, Germany. Early life He was born in Manhattan, New York City on February 22, 1910 to Anton Kaufman and Fannie Newman. His parents had married on March 14, 1909. His father had been a reporter for the Berliner Morgen-Zeitung in Berlin, Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1905. Theodore's three brothers were Herbert, Julian, and Leonard. He attended South Side High School in Newark, New Jersey and graduated around 1928. In 1934, he was arrested along with his blind father, Anton Kaufman, for the robbery of Sandor Alexander Balint of Budapest. Balint had developed a process to increase the aging of wine. The Kaufmans had purchased this formula from Balint, but later came to believe that the formula was \\"worthless\\". Theodore Kaufman's mother died in 1939. Kaufman traveled to the Sahara Desert and wrote: \\"you look at the horizon all day long and feel that you are staring at eternity.\\" In Biskra he met Clare Sheridan. Kaufman became the owner of a small advertising agency and ticket agency in South Orange, New Jersey. He published the New Jersey Legal Record. Kaufman founded the Argyle Press of Newark, New Jersey to publish his political pamphlets. Life during World War II Kaufman was a radical intent on preventing American involvement in future wars in Europe. In 1939, under the auspices of the \\"American Federation of Peace\\", an unknown entity of which he was the president and probably only member, Kaufman produced several publications. One pamphlet, titled \\"Passive Purchase\\" advocated the establishment of a two-week period during which Americans would curtail their spending in order to demonstrate public opposition to American intervention in European conflicts. In a section of the pamphlet on the American Federation of Peace's beliefs, Kaufman advocated for \\"the strongest possible military defense of the United States\\" and stated that \\"by keeping absolutely aloof from foreign wars and entanglements the American People face a truly great future.\\" That same year, the group also issued publications with more contentious messages, one of which read: > A possible plea to Congress. ... Have Us All Sterilized! ... If You Plan On > Sending Us To A Foreign War ... Spare Us Any Possibility Of Ever Bringing > Children Into This World ‚Äî Into This Country Of Ours! Map showing Kaufman's proposed dismemberment of Germany (and Austria). Two years later he shifted his focus to the forced mass-sterilization of all German men under 65 and the sterilization of most German women under 45. This would eliminate \\"inbred Germanism,\\" he proposed, thus solving a great deal of humanity's problems. He also promoted the distribution of Germany's lands among the neighboring countries. His effort was spearheaded by the self- publication of the book Germany Must Perish! : \\"Since Germans are the perennial disturbers of the world's peace ... they must be dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them. The army groups, as organized units, would be the easiest and quickest to deal with. ... The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed territories, is about 70,000,000, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve the purpose of German extinction it would be necessary to only sterilize some 48,000,000 -- a figure which excludes, because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of age, and females over 45. ... Taking 20,000 surgeons as an arbitrary number and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations daily, it would take no more than one month, at the maximum, to complete their sterilization. ... The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly. Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance.\\" Although Kaufman's book had a minimal impact in the United States, it gained attention in Nazi Germany, where propagandists used it as evidence of an international Jewish plan to destroy the German people. On July 24, 1941, the Nazi Party's newspaper, V√∂lkischer Beobachter, published a front-page article on the book titled: \\"The Product of Criminal Jewish Sadism: Roosevelt Demands the Sterilization of the German People.\\" The newspaper alleged that Kaufman was a close ally of Samuel Irving Rosenman, an advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and that: \\"Given the close relationship of the writer to the White House, this monstrous war program can be seen as a synthesis of genuine Talmudic hatred and Roosevelt's views on foreign policy.\\" At the time, the German leadership was engaged in a propaganda campaign designed to rally popular support for the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Antisemitism in general, and Kaufman's ideas in particular, became a focus of this campaign. Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels read the book in early August and immediately grasped its value, writing in his diary: \\"This Jew did a real service for the enemy [German] side. Had he written this book for us, he could not have made it any better.\\" Under Goebbels' direction, Germany Must Perish! continued to receive significant media attention in Germany. Portions of the book were read on national radio, and Goebbels ordered the printing of five million copies of a pamphlet that summarized Kaufman's ideas. Nazi propaganda often used Kaufman's pamphlet as a justification for the persecution of Jews. When the Nazis required German Jews to wear a yellow badge on their clothing on September 1, 1941, they published a flyer explaining to the German people that those individuals wearing the star were conspiring to implement Kaufman's plan for the destruction of Germany. When the Jews of Hanover were forced from their homes on September 8, 1941, German authorities cited Kaufman's book as one of the reasons. Kaufman responded by saying: > This is just a flimsy pretext for another of the innate cruelties of the > German people ... I don't think it was my book that prompted this barbarity. > They employed every possible German cruelty against the Jews long before my > book was published. The Nazi propaganda ministry continued to publish pamphlets, posters and flyers on Kaufman's ideas through the end of the war, and also urged newspapers and public speakers to remind Germans of Kaufman's book. Kaufman's last major appearance in Nazi propaganda occurred in late 1944, when a five- page section on him was included in the widely published booklet Never!, which described a number of alleged plots to destroy Germany. Randall Bytwerk, an historian of communications at Calvin College, concluded that \\"[a] German at the time could not have missed encountering\\" propaganda about Kaufman. His final publication through Argyle Press was the March 1942 brochure titled \\"No More German Wars! Being an outline for their permanent cessation\\". It contained no more writing on the sterilization of Germans or discussion of German land distribution, but made very moderate proposals for democratic re- education of the German population. He enlisted in the US Army in New Mexico on April 24, 1942.Theodore N. Kaufman in the U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946. His three brothers also served. Kaufman married the former Jean Siris in a civil ceremony on November 23, 1942 in Harris County, Texas.Texas County Marriage Records. Post-war years and death After World War II, Kaufman disappeared entirely from public life. One scholar, Berel Lang, a Visiting Professor of Philosophy and Letters at Wesleyan University, failed to locate Kaufman in the records of the city of Newark and in other sources.

Hanchen focuses mainly on the growing, processing and marketing of tobacco, organic rice and other agricultural products, as well as trading in leaf tobacco, cigarettes, and tobacco packing materials. Hanchen Group is the owner of two cigarette brands: 'Hakka' and 'Penang', which are mainly sold in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Corporate history During its history, Hanchen Group has been dedicating itself to the international trade of leaf tobacco and cigarette packing materials. In 2008 Hanchen Group initiated a tobacco growing project in Muse, Myanmar, near the Chinese border. The size of the site is 80 hectares. Following the success achieved in the Myanmar project Hanchen Group decided to expand its production. In 2010 the company signed a long term rental agreement for 10,000 hectares of farmland in Cambodia, to develop large scale agricultural plantations. As well as growing tobacco, Hanchen Group is farming organic rice and certain other crops there. The company intends to develop ecological and sustainable Macro-Agriculture in the area, making use of advanced and latest agricultural technologies. The project is designed on the basis of vertical integration, combining crop growing, processing, trading and distribution. Hanchen Group is also targeting the growing international market for ecologically grown food products. Market The 'Hakka' and 'Penang' cigarette brands enjoy a growing reputation and popularity in Taiwan. In 2009, these 2 brands gained a combined market share of 1.25% in Taiwan. The annual growth rate has been around 10% and further improvement in market share is anticipated.

The Myanmar growing area is located in the Muse district, close to the Chinese border. In Myanmar Hanchen Group applies Chinese tobacco varieties and technologies in cooperation with local Muse Cigarette factory. =Organic rice production= Hanchen Group produces rice under natural growing conditions that completely exclude the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and all other non-organic products. Both the consumer products and the soil used for production, do not contain any traces of chemical residues. Neither hormones nor genetically manipulated seeds are used in Hanchen Group rice production. The Hanchen organic rice growing area is located at the banks of the Mekong River. Every year during the rainy season the land is flooded. These floods, when the water retracts, leave large quantities of fertile alluvial soil on the land. The organic matter is a natural fertilizer which provides sufficient plant nutrition for the organic crops. The alternating wet and dry seasons, together with the annual flooding, to a large extent disrupt the life cycle of many insects and soil diseases. This greatly reduces the need for disease and insect control measures. =Business partners= Include: * Bulgartabac * CDF Lippoel Leaf B.V. * CNT Tobacco * China National Tobacco Corporation * Egypt Eastern Company * Iranian Tobacco Company * Universal Corporation Corporate Social Responsibility Hanchen Group has a Corporate Social Responsibility policy which regulates its own actions.

The film features a rare performance from actor Vivian MacKerrell, who was later the inspiration for Withnail in Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I. The story and screenplay are by Philip Norman, Rosemary Sutcliff and Stephen Weeks and music is composed by Ron Geesin. In a 2017 interview for \\"The Bill Podcast\\", actor Larry Dann revealed he has never been paid for his work on the film.https://soundcloud.com/thebillpodcast/05-larry-dann Plot During the 1930s, three privileged old University friends gather for the week-end in an old country house located in a sprawling British estate. In fact, McFadden (Murray Melvin), the estate's owner, which he has recently inherited, invites his two college acquaintances Talbot (Larry Dann) and Duller (Vivian MacKerrell) ostensibly for a week-end of game hunting. Duller is sullen and rude, though an excellent shot while Talbot is easygoing but puzzled as to why he was asked along, especially when his colleagues continually abuse and ridicule him. As soon as they arrive, personality clashes, petty arguments and gloomy environment start on wear on everyone's nerves. To make matters worse, McFadden neglects to mention that the place might be haunted. During the night, Talbot begins to have strange hallucinations involving a creepy porcelain doll and the former occupants of the mansion; he finds himself transported back into time, bearing witness to the trials and tribulations of a young woman Sophy (Marianne Faithfull), who once resided in the house. As the story progresses, the tenuous ties that bind the men together begin to unravel and the strange visions begin to become more and more vivid until they threaten to drive one of them, Talbot mad. It turns out to be haunted by the previous occupants, though only Talbot can see them. Finally, McFadden admits that he invited Talbot and Duller because he had heard rumours that the house was haunted and he chose them both as likely subjects to draw any spirits out in the open. As the visions become more frequent and detailed, Talbot is thrust into a strange supernatural realm of incest, arson and madness that is impossible to escape from.

According to the 1654 census the Bila Tserkva regiment had 18 companies which consisted of 19 cities and towns (among were Fastiv, Volodarka, Boyarka, and Bohuslav) with the population having 6,668 cossacks and townspeople. When a civil war emerged among the cossacks the Hetmanate was split along the Dnieper River into Left- Bank Ukraine and Right-Bank Ukraine, which placed the regiment under the control of Right-bank Ukraine hetmans. After the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667, the Right-bank Ukraine and its regiments came under the administration of Poland and in 1674 the regiment was abolished by the Polish government. During the Semen Paliy insurrection of 1702, Bila Tserkva was captured by Paliy's rebels and the territory was placed under the Fastiv regiment, but was later restored back into the Bila Tserkva regiment and made the headquarters for Paliy. Once the rebellion was repressed and with Polish authority being reinstated the Right-bank cossack administration was abolished in 1712 by the Treaty of Prut. The regiment was disbanded and all of its territories were annexed into the Kyiv Voivodeship, while the remaining cossacks moved to the left-bank Ukraine.

Just as the smooth sections of the tangent bundle (vector fields) make up a vector space, the space of smooth k-vector fields over M make up a vector space \\\\Gamma(\\\\Lambda^k TM). Furthermore, since the tangent bundle is dual to the cotangent bundle, multivector fields of degree k are dual to k-forms, and both are subsumed in the general concept of a tensor field, which is a section of some tensor bundle, often consisting of exterior powers of the tangent and cotangent bundles. A (k,0)-tensor field is a differential k-form, a (0,1)-tensor field is a vector field, and a (0,k)-tensor field is k-vector field. While differential forms are widely studied as such in differential geometry and differential topology, multivector fields are often encountered as tensor fields of type (0,k), except in the context of the geometric algebra (see also Clifford algebra).

History A southeastern appanage principality of Kievan Rus, the capital of which was Terebovlia. Its territories included parts of southeastern Galicia, Bukovyna, and western Podolia. It bordered on Kiev principality to the east, Zvenyhorod principality to the west, and parts of Volodymyr-Volynskyi principality, Lutsk principality, and Peresopnytsia principality to the north. Vasylko Rostyslavych extensively colonized the territories southeast of Terebovlia by employing Turkic peoples (Berendeys, Torks, and Pechenegs), and he annexed Ponyzia, thereby securing it against nomadic raiders. Halych gained importance as a political and economic center; other important cities and fortresses included Terebovlia, Mykulyn (now Mykulyntsi), Chern (now Chernivtsi), Vasyliv (Bukovyna), Onut, Kuchelemyn, Bakota, Ushytsia, and Kalius. After Vasylko Rostyslavych's death in 1124, Halych principality seceded, and by 1141 Terebovlia principality had become a part of the Principality of Halych. After the Rostyslavych dynasty died out, it was briefly an appanage principality under Iziaslav Volodymyrovych.

On 21 November 1873, Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, announced that the Roman Catholic Bishops had agreed to form a College of Higher Studies for Catholics.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Open Letter 21 November 1873: Ma.2/5/30 The College was established to provide higher education to Catholics who were forbidden by papal decree to attend the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The College was established at Abingdon House in Kensington which was adapted by George Goldie, and Monsignor Thomas John Capel was appointed Rector. The Catholic bishops decided that the College should be funded not by special collections in churches, but by donations from the wealthy Catholic families who would benefit from its creationWestminster Diocesan Archive: Acta of the Bishops' Meetings, 9 April 1875: 34.5 until such time as it would become independently supported by the fees of its students. Much of the initial cost, however, was placed upon the bishops themselves and many, including William Bernard Ullathorne, Bishop of Birmingham, although agreeing in principle with the idea of the college, objected to having to bear the costs of an institution based in London that they felt would not benefit students in their dioceses.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter Regarding the Catholic University College 7 July 1876: Ma.2/5/6 By June 1877 Mgr.

There was some discussion regarding moving the College to the country and selling the land and buildings in London. This would have the advantage of both reducing costs and in the eyes of the bishops improving the moral state of the students. To make matters worse, Capel claimed that running the College had left him heavily in debt and attempted a legal claim against Manning.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Statement Regarding the Catholic University College 7 January 1879: Ma.2/5/110 Eventually the land was sold and the College closed in 1882.

Thomas II of Savoy invaded the territory of Asti, but he was defeated by the Astigiani army at Montebruno in Garzigliana, near Pinerolo. Thomas II had taken refuge in Turin, however there he was captured.  Background  Asti was one of the first free communes of Italy, and in 1140 received the right to mint coins of its own by Conrad II. As the commune, however, had begun to erode the lands of the bishop and other local faudataries, the latter sued for help to Frederick Barbarossa, who appeared under the city walls with a huge army in February 1155. After a short siege, Asti was stormed and burned. Subsequently, Asti adhered to the Lombard League (1169) against the German emperor, but was again defeated in 1174. Despite this, after the Peace of Constance (1183), the city gained further privileges. The 13th century saw the peak of the Astigiani economic and cultural splendour, only momentarily hindered by the wars against Alba, Alessandria, Savoy, Milan (which besieged the city in 1230), and the Marquess of Montferrat and Saluzzo. In particular, the commune aimed to gain control over the lucrative trade routes leading northwards from the Ligurian ports. In this period, the rise of the Casane Astigiane resulted in contrasting political familial alliances of Guelph and Ghibelline supporters. During the wars led by Emperor Frederick II in northern Italy, the city chose his side: Asti was defeated by the Guelphs of Alessandria at the Battle of Quattordio and the Battle of Calmandrana, but thanks to Genoese help could recover easily. After Frederick's death, the struggle against Thomas II of Savoy became fierce.  Battle  The Astigiani attacked Thomas' army at Montebruno, near Pinerolo. The two armies charged head-on, and the clash ended with a bloody repulse for Thomas II. Thomas himself was captured in the battle, and his Savoyard armies were utterly defeated. This setback made Thomas more infuriated than defeated. He later ordered all Astigiani traders in Savoy and France to be arrested, and his wrath boiled.  Aftermath  The decision to capture the Astigiani traders showed the preoccupation of the neighbouring states for the excessive power gained by the city, which had captured Alba and controlled both Chieri and Turin. This later led to intervention by Charles I of Naples, then the most powerful man in Italy thanks to his possessions in Piedmont and Provence alongside his Neapolitan kingdom. He defeated the Astigiani at the Battle of Cassano, but was later defeated at the Battle of Roccavione.

Plot The Caribbean Star, a combination cargo ship and floating casino is hijacked by terrorists led by Luis Carreras (John Vernon), who installs an atomic bomb, holding both the passengers and the bomb hostage, hoping to exchange them for the gold bullion on a U.S. Treasury ship. However, First Officer John Carter (Richard Harris), Susan Beresford (Ann Turkel), and Dr. Marston (Gordon Jackson) join forces to foil the plan.

Film rights were bought almost immediately; Laurence Harvey announced he would star and produce along with Daniel Angel. \\"I think it's easily as exciting as Guns of Navarone\\", said Harvey. However the film was not made until 1977. It starred Richard Harris and Ann Turkel, who were then married, and who had just appeared in The Cassandra Crossing together. Harris praised Turkel for encouraging him to cut down on his drinking. \\"Now my creativity is flowing again\\", he said. \\"Now in the middle of the night I must suddenly get up and write. I'm not going to end up like [Dylan] Thomas, lonely and misunderstood.\\" =Differences from Novel= The basic film plot follows that of the book for almost the entire story with only a few differences; for example, in the book Captain Bullen is wounded by gunfire during the taking of the 'Campari'(Caribbean Star) whilst in the film, Bullen is shot dead. As the book character spent the remainder of the story incapacitated, the plot continued in much the same way without him. Similarly Dr. Taubman's character possessed a wife who was absent from the novel, as were David Janssen's character of Charles Conway, and Burgess Meredith's character Van Heurden. However a different ending was scripted for the film in order to increase plot tension and create something far more dramatic and spectacular. The final fifteen minutes of the screenplay led to a conclusion that bore little resemblance to the book plot. Perhaps because of this deviation from the original story, and any resulting disagreements following its release, the film was later renamed 'Nuclear Terror.' =Production= The film was shot in South Africa. The film was started by Freddie Francis but completed by Ashley Lazarus.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/76657/Golden-Rendezvous/misc-notes.html The film went $1.5 million over budget. This was blamed on Richard Harris who, it was alleged, held up production with his drinking and rewriting of the script. Producer Euan Lloyd later discovered this was not entirely true ‚Äì however, it made it difficult for Lloyd to cast Harris in his next film, The Wild Geese. Harris admitted rewriting the script but says he was invited to do so. \\"I worked 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, helping to get them out of a hole. And at the end I got slammed for it. Worse ‚Äì found myself uninsurable. Even after the film opened in Europe, I still didn't give up. I said 'Let me take 10 minutes out and put back some stuff and I promise you it'll work.' But they weren't interested. And so we're left with another Harris flop.\\" Release After the European release, a six-minute prologue was shot to make the plot more explicable. The movie performed poorly at the box office. The Guardian called the film \\"nothing but dross\\". Scandal The film was tied up in a South African political scandal after a Supreme Court judge made public evidence of corruption and the misappropriation of millions of pound of public funds. Mr Justice Anton, Mostert was undertaking a one-man Commission of Inquiry into exchange control conventions, when he announced he had uncovered corruption, mostly the using of US$13.8 million (¬£8.6 million) in government funds to set up The Citizen, an English-language newspaper that would support the government. The scandal led to the resignation of Prime Minister John Vorster.https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/21/obituaries/eschel-rhoodie-a-south- african-at-center-of-scandal-dies-at-60.html In addition, $5 million was transferred from a Swiss bank to a South African company called Thor Communicators, some of which was used as security for loans to make Golden Rendezvous. Prime Minister Pieter Botha set up an official inquiry to investigate the allegations. Producer Andre Pieterse admitted that 825,000 rand (¬£475,000) was transferred to him to create a film industry for blacks in South Africa. This would involve the production of ideological films, the distribution of films from abroad acceptable to South African blacks, and the construction chain of cinemas for blacks. However, due to difficulties with other government departments, the project was never realised and the money instead wound up in Golden Rendezvous. Money for the film had been raised in South Africa but backers dropped out shortly before production had begun. Pieterse had already sold the distribution rights to the as-yet-unmade film in thirty two countries for a total of 2.5 million rand; if the film was not made he risked being sued and being stuck with a bill for wages for the cast and crew. So Pieterse refinanced the project through an American bank, Chemical, under stringer terms which resulted in another million dollars being added to the budget. Pieterse was allowed to use the government money to secure finance for the loan for Golden Rendezvous. Eschel Rhoodie was the head of the Department of Information at the time and a friend of Pieterse's. Pieterse: > I explained to Rhoodie the situation, the fact the I would be personally > ruined, that the industry could be badly damaged, and talked him into > employing 825,000 rand which at that stage was on fixed deposit with > Barclays Bank ‚Äî to allow me to employ it as security for the production > loan.

Unfortunately > for me the production got further out of hand, and the film far exceeded the > budget.Bart Mills, \\"The Celluloid Scandal\\", The Spectator 25 Nov 1978 Pieterse says filming ran into trouble because of difficulties involved in shooting on a ship, and because Richard Harris drank a bottle of vodka a day. Pieterse alleged that these things caused filming to be delayed by 44 days and meant that the producer was unable to raise capital abroad, and make a sale to North America. Pieterse later sought $1.5 million in damages from Harris. Harris was then making Game for Vultures in South Africa and a warrant was issued for his arrest by a Johannesburg court. Harris responded, \\"Mr Pieterse owes me money, not I him\\", claiming he was owed $50,000, and that Pieterse's comments were \\"totally untrue and completely defamatory.\\" Sheriffs failed to serve a warrant of arrest on Harris and it was reported that the parties were working on a settlement. \\"I don't believe that in a country like South Africa that they will arrest a gentleman like me\\", said Harris. \\"I'd be a fool to deny I had a drink\\", said Harris. \\"But when I was drinking I never let it get in the way of my work. Everybody on that film was drinking, we were all so fucking miserable.\\" Harris threatened to sue for defamation and the matter never went to court. Pieterse did succeed in selling the film to Time-Life for syndication for 525,000 rand.

They are also known as Ahir, and are a sub-group within the larger Ahir community of India. Origin The Bhurtiya are a sub-division of the Ahir community. Like other Ahirs, they claim descent from the god Krishna. They are said to have immigrated to Gujarat, where they were known as Chaurasia. About three centuries ago, these Chaurasia settled in Awadh. The etymology of the word Bhurtiya is that it is a corruption of the Hindi word phurti, which means quickness. According to their tribal legends, an ancestor of the community was in such a rush, that she left her jewellery, and was given the nickname phurti, and this name was given to her descendants. Over time this was said to be corrupted to Bhurtiya. They are found mainly in the districts of Varanasi, (Dihi Khurd),Allahabad, Meerut and Mathura. Present circumstances The Bhurtiya are divided into several gotras, such as Bamaria, Bijlauria, Darariha, Dayarba, Duhilwar, Mankathiya, Nurara and Udyana. Marriages are prohibited within the gotra, and the Bhurtiya are strictly endogamous. They are a community of settled agriculturist, with animal husbandry being subsidiary occupation. Like other Ahirs, the community were traditionally graziers, rearing and breeding cattle. They still sell ghee and other dairy products in the towns near their villages.

Nathan Parker worked there for something less than a year in 1946, in a variety of positions to learn about all aspects of the operation, ranging from cutting steel to painting cabinets to accounting. He then came to the West Coast to help set up cabinet-making operations there for Parker Mfg. Co., and served as its secretary-treasurer and as a director. In order to produce the cabinets, Parker Mfg. Co. needed a sheet-metal shear and a press. Due to the war though, machine tool manufacturers were backed up with orders so far that two-year delivery times were not uncommon. However, the company had a very talented chief engineer on the payroll, Harold Verson, who had been chief engineer in his family's machine-tool manufacturing business in Chicago.Clark, William, \\"Verson Allsteel History Revolves Around Brothers,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 18, 1959, E-7, Chicago, IL (https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/564928502.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:AI&type;=historic&date;=May+18%2C+1959&author;=WILLIAM+CLARK&pub;=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+%281923-1963%29&edition;=&startpage;=E7&desc;=Verson+Alisteel+History+Revolves+Around+Brothers).Hampson, Philip, \\"The Road to Success,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, Oct. 29, 1955, B-5, Chicago, IL (https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/506851552.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:AI&type;=historic&date;=Oct+29%2C+1955&author;=Philip+Hampson&pub;=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+%281923-1963%29&edition;=&startpage;=B5&desc;=The+Road+to+Success).Wirry, Anthony, \\"Giant Presses Speed Nation's Goods Output,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, Sep. 21, 1947, A-7, Chicago, IL (https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/495778402.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:AI&type;=historic&date;=Sep+21%2C+1947&author;=ANTHONY+WIRRY&pub;=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+%281923-1963%29&edition;=&startpage;=A7&desc;=GIANT+PRESSES+SPEED+NATION%27S+GOODS+OUTPUT). He proposed that they design and build their own shear, which they then did. The machine was a success. M.

Customers ranged from small firms to large manufacturers, both domestically and abroad, including O'Keefe & Merritt, Baldwin Piano Co., Burroughs Adding Machine Co., Gillig Bros., and Toledo Desk & Fixture Co. As the post-war economy gradually got back to normal in the late 1940s, the lead times for machine tools began to shrink. To compete effectively with the big machine tool manufacturers, Parker Mfg. Co. would have had to dramatically expand. The company also experienced labor unrest. The workers wanted to unionize and demanded a significant pay increase. The company was already paying the highest wages in the area, and President Parker asked the labor leaders for some time to think it over. Within 30 days, the company sold the operation.

In 1259, Ezzelino da Romano and his Ghibelline army moved into Lombardy and besieged Orci Novi. But the approach of the Guelph army forced Ezzelino to abandon the siege and cross the Oglio River. Joined by exiled nobles from Milan, the Ghibellines attempted to take the city of Monza by force, but the attempt failed. Ezzelino and his troops, aware of the dangerous position they were now in, retreated to the Adda River. Here, Ezzelino III da Romano and his troops were defeated by the Guelphs under Azzo VII d'Este. Ezzelino was wounded and captured, and imprisoned at Soncino, where he died of his wounds a few days later.

Kisco, New York) is an American photographer, author and video director, mostly of musicians. He is known as \\"the only rock photographer to have shot album covers for The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who.\\" Family and early life The son of Charles Howland Russell and Alice Allen Russell, he is the great-grandson of suffragist Florence Jaffray Harriman and the great-grandson of Episcopal bishop Henry C. Potter. He has three siblings. His brother Jeremy Borden Russell (1944‚Äì2005) was founder and manager of the rock band Blue Cheer. Other siblings are Linda Russell Matson, (1947-) and Adam Henry Russell (1953‚Äì2009). His godfather is Cole Porter. His family moved to Manhattan in 1950, then in 1952 to San Francisco. Russell attended high school at Cate School outside Santa Barbara, California, then the University of California, Davis, where he majored in English and Art. He was first introduced and became interested in photography at Davis, but did not work professionally until 1968 when he traveled to England. Career Let It Be album coverThe Philadelphia Inquirer described Russell when he was beginning his career: \\"In 1968, Ethan Russell, a lanky Californian fresh out of college, was living in a London flat, psychedelic posters on the wall, battered purple Beatle boots thrown in a corner, a Nikon camera on the table.\\" He had moved to London with aspirations of becoming a writer, working (and photographing) in a home for autistic children part-time. In a 2013 interview with The Guardian he cited the movie Blowup as an inspiration for his move to the UK. He was introduced to Mick Jagger that year. The Sunday Times described the results of that meeting: \\"Russell [...] hit it off with the singer, and from 1968 to ‚Äô72 was the Rolling Stones‚Äô main photographer. One of his early sessions featured Brian Jones at his home, Cotchford Farm in East Sussex, previously owned by A. A. Milne. Russell‚Äôs pictures of Jones, draped around a statue of Christopher Robin and provocatively waving a gun, encapsulate the troubled nature of the doomed guitarist, who was found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool six months later. But it‚Äôs Russell‚Äôs photographs of the band on their 1969 US tour ‚Äì most unseen until now ‚Äì that provide the most compelling insight.\\" Music critic Joel Selvin wrote about the moment in time when Russell connected with the Rolling Stones: \\"Russell caught the Rolling Stones at a historic juncture. He took some of the last photos ever taken of Brian Jones, before the founding member was fired from the band. He photographed the Stones' free concert in Hyde Park that served as Jones' memorial after he was found drowned in his swimming pool.\\" A photo he took was used on the cover of the 1969 album Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2), which was dedicated to Brian Jones. 1969 Rolling Stones American Tour Russell was hired as the photographer for The Rolling Stones American Tour 1969, and was part of the band's small entourage. The San Francisco Chronicle described his role: \\"Russell was one of only 16 people on the tour, including the band. With unprecedented access to the Rolling Stones, he captured photos that have become classics.\\" Joel Selvin observed: \\"Russell joined a touring party of 16 for the Stones' tour of the United States in 1969, which ended with the disastrous free concert at Altamont Speedway. It was really the first big-time rock tour ever and the world in transition he captured disappeared almost immediately. His photography was used to illustrate the cover of Get Yer Ya- Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert, which was recorded during the 1969 tour. The Beatles and Let It Be Critic Todd Leopold of CNN Entertainment wrote: \\"Ethan Russell first met the Beatles in early 1969. Photographs of Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones production Rock and Roll Circus attracted the interest of Beatles consigliere Neil Aspinall, who invited Russell to Twickenham Studios, where the group was making Let It Be. Russell's photographs ended up on the cover and gatefold of the LP, the last the Beatles released. . . . Russell's photographs show four men trying to rescue their fading musical marriage.\\" Russell was among three photographers at the final formal photo session of the Beatles on August 22, 1969. This was held at Tittenhurst Park, a home then owned by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and later owned by Ringo Starr. Other photographers participating were Monte Fresco of the Daily Mirror, and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans. The Who Working with The Who, Russell did the cover photography for Who's Next in 1971 and the photography for the book that accompanied Quadrophenia in 1973. However, Russell did not shoot the cover for Quadrophenia. That was shot by photographer Graham Hughes. https://www.thewho.com/music/quadrophenia/ Pete Townshend's opinion of Russell's photographs was: \\"They look ready to put up in the National Gallery. Ethan is the civilised eye of an uncivilised art- form: rock 'n' roll.\\" Russell received a Grammy nomination for his work on Quadrophenia. One of Russell's photos was used on the cover of the 1988 compilation album, Who's Better, Who's Best. Photography of other musicians His roster of subjects also includes Jerry Lee Lewis, Phil Everly, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, The Moody Blues, Cream, Traffic, Elkie Brooks, Eric Clapton, Linda Ronstadt, John Hiatt, Rickie Lee Jones, Audioslave, Spooky Tooth and Rosanne Cash. In 1978 Russell shifted his focus to film and video, becoming \\"a pioneer in producing music videos\\", but leaving a cache of iconoclastic still photographs largely unseen for nearly 30 years. He produced and directed films with Leon Redbone, Rickie Lee Jones, Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, k.d. lang, Rosanne Cash, Hank Williams, Jr. and Randy Travis and John Lennon and Yoko Ono. In reviewing Rosanne Cash's video What We Really Want in 1991, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Photographer-director Russell has concocted a weird, two-dimensional world of paintings for Cash to step into, singing one of her latest songs of woe and miscommunication. It's a visual effect that's been tried in videos many times before, but never quite to this successfully surreal an effect.\\" In the 1990s Russell garnered his second Grammy nomination for the video There's A Tear In My Beer with Hank Williams, Jr. Publication of his book Let It Bleed spawned the resurgence of Russell's still photography, beginning with an exhibition directly related to the book that premiered at Digital Domain in Los Angeles in 2005. The exhibition has since traveled to New York, London, Paris, Rotterdam, San Francisco, San Diego and Australia. Books by Russell *Dear Mr. Fantasy: Diary of a Decade: Our Time and Rock and Roll (1985) The Christian Science Monitor reviewed this book in 1985: \\"Every once in a long while, one finds a book that wholly captures the mood and essence of an era.

NCPSU is seen by modern researchers as one of the first organizations of the New Left in the USSR. However, Austrian researcher Hans Azenbaum, who studied the ideology of NCPSU, tends to view this party as the one focusing on the \\"third way\\", i.e. neither capitalism, nor real socialism.  History  The party was the result of a merger of two clandestine radical left groups: Party of New Communists (PNC) (Russian: –ü–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ (–ü–ù–ö)) and \\"Left School\\" (Russian: –õ–µ–≤–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞), which were formed simultaneously, but independently from each other in December 1972 - January 1973. Members of the two groups established contact in September 1973 and the possibility of a merger was broached in May 1974, but it was not until September 1974 that the groups joined forces. After the merger, the two groups ideologically enriched each other through bringing together the ideas of Trotskyism and the New Left (mainly Herbert Marcuse, Che Guevara and R√©gis Debray) by PNC and the ideas of French atheist existentialism (essentially, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry) by the \\"Left School\\". NCPSU members were planning to hold a founding congress in January 1977 (with July as a fallback). It had been expected that the congress would elect the party's governing body - Central Committee, discuss and adopt the Charter and the Programme of NCPSU. Prior to that \\"The Principles of Neo- communism\\" (Russian: –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø—ã –Ω–µ–æ–∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞) - written by Alexander Tarasov in November 1973 and adapted in May‚ÄìJune 1974 at the request of the \\"Left School\\" for the newly created organization - were accepted by its members as a temporary theoretical document of NCPSU. These plans were nevertheless disrupted by the failure of 1975 and the events of April 1977. The founding congress of NCPSU never took place. In September 1974, \\"the leading five\\" became a temporary governing and coordinating body of NCPSU (pending the election of its Central Committee), including Alexander Tarasov (theory, general leadership); Natalia Magnat (theory, general leadership); Vasily Minorsky (activity within technical universities and colleges and counterculture circles); Olga Barash (activity within liberal arts universities and colleges and translating); Igor Dukhanov (communication with regional groups, provision of security). In 1977 Igor Dukhanov was replaced by S.Trubkin in \\"the leading five\\". All decisions of \\"the leading five\\" outside of their areas of competence were made collectively by majority vote. In 1975 NCPSU was struck by a failure: KGB identified and arrested several members of the Moscow section of the party, including some leaders, but the extent of the failure has been limited only to former members of PNC: in spite of formal integration, the two groups were (de facto) still independent and connections between them were weak. KGB investigators failed to prove any connection between former PNC members and the other half of NCPSU (former \\"Left School\\"), as well as their connections with regional groups. They also failed to get convincing proof of serious anti-Soviet activity (partially, because NCPSU archive, previously kept in the village of Valentinovka, Moscow Oblast, has been destroyed in January 1975). During the investigation, arrested members of NCPSU claimed that they mainly upheld the ideas of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, considered to be the official ideology of the USSR, while some evasion towards Trotskyism, anarchism and existentialism cannot be a crime, because in the USSR one cannot be tried for their views, but only for their actions. As a result, the NCPSU case was never brought to trial. Several \\"most dangerous\\" party members (from the KGB's point of view) were confined - extrajudicially - in special psychiatric hospitals for periods ranging from six months to one year (Also read: Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union). The rest were excluded from their universities and from Komsomol. Limited scale of 1975 failure proved that NCPSU was largely clandestine. The organization had a system of passwords and post boxes for connecting with regional groups; all NCPSU members had noms de guerre. Letters to regions were written with invisible ink. After the failure of 1975, NCPSU activity was practically paralyzed. Unaffected party members (led by N. Magnat and O. Barash) managed to preserve NCPSU from complete breakdown through increased secrecy. Connection with regional groups was lost temporarily. During 1977-1980 NCPSU restored its activity. In April 1977, NCPSU members once again became objects of KGB investigation, this time the one related to 1977 Moscow bombings ‚Äì bomb explosions in Moscow Metro and on 25 October Street (now: Nikolskaya Street). These terrorist attacks claimed seven lives, while thirty-seven people were injured. The official version of events, made public in January 1979, claimed that the explosions were organized by an underground Armenian nationalist organization led by Stepan Zatikyan. But for NCPSU members this investigation resulted in detentions, interrogations and establishing a demonstrative surveillance. \\"Incriminated\\" NCPSU members were aware of undisguised monitoring by KGB up until 1982. In all, there were 32 members in NCPSU, mainly in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, but there were also groups in Kirov (2 members), Leningrad (2 members), in Ukraine (Dnepropetrovsk, 2 members), in Georgia (Tbilisi and Rustavi, 2 members), in Latvia (Riga, 1 member). Of these, 10 members failed in Moscow in 1975 and 2 more in Kirov in 1980. There is also evidence of an attempt to establish an affiliated group in Kineshma (Ivanovo Oblast), but this attempt was not successful. In 1984, analyzing the processes taking place in the USSR (following the deaths of Mikhail Suslov, Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov, the party leaders have concluded that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regime was on the brink of collapse and that the country will soon enter a period of radical transformation. In the new circumstances a small clandestine organization would not be able to play any significant social role or affect political processes in the country. This had become a topic of NCPSU discussion in the second half of 1984 leading to the party's self-dissolution in January 1985).  Ideology  = Early period = Party's early ideological principles were outlined by Alexander Tarasov in \\"The Principles of Neo-communism\\" (Russian: –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø—ã –Ω–µ–æ–∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞) and some other works (\\"Every Man is a King\\", \\"Chile, Cyprus crisis and Eurocommunism\\", \\"Revolutionary Dictature, NEP and Stalinism\\", \\"Swamp Rot. Black Hundreds as Revolutionary Counter-revolutionism of Petit bourgeoisie\\", etc.), which have been destroyed together with the party's archive in the village of Valentinovka in 1975. In accordance with those early principles the USSR economy was viewed as socialist from the late 1930s (which corresponded to the official Stalinism guideline), but at the same time the political system was seen as non-socialist: with socialism the power should belong to the society, to the people, but in the USSR it belonged to the ruling bureaucracy. In reality the society was removed from power. To explain this phenomenon A. Tarasov used Vladimir Lenin's idea of the possibility of the \\"power takeover\\". In Tarasov's interpretation, in the late 1920s ‚Äì early 1930s a group of Joseph Stalin's supporters, representing the interests of petit bourgeoisie ‚Äì first and foremost, of the bureaucratic officials, - has defeated the groups representing the interests of the working class and revolutionary intelligentsia in the inner-party struggle, and overtook the power. This became possible because the economy was not socialist yet, while in the multi- structural soviet national economy state capitalism was the most progressive form of economic organization. Through large-scale repressions and eradication of potential political opposition Stalin and his accomplices secured their own political immunity. In the late 1930s, when soviet economy has become socialist \\"in the main\\", and, consequently, the society could take the power over, no one who would be capable of doing so was left: politically active part of society was wiped out, the rest were frightened. The bureaucratic rule was established. This theory implied that suchlike socio-economic system was unnatural and therefore would eventually lead to inevitable political revolution, when political superstructure would be aligned with the economic base. According to A. Tarasov, the bureaucratic rule is holding back the development of productive forces and thus brings to life the classic conflict of Marxism: the conflict between productive forces and the relations of production. Tarasov also advocated the idea that the dictatorship of soviet bureaucracy, counter-revolutionary by nature, is doomed to failure due to its foreign policy ‚Äì the policy of rejection of the world revolution, the policy of \\"peaceful competition with capitalism\\" (which manifested itself in the dissolution of Comintern by Stalin). This policy was defensive - not offensive. USSR was losing its allies both on the state level (The People's Republic of China, Albania, Yugoslavia, Egypt, etc.), and within the communist movement (the breakaway of Maoists, Eurocommunists, Dominican Communist Party, Communist Party of the Netherlands, etc.) Therefore, Tarasov concluded, Soviet government would inevitably lose in the \\"peaceful competition\\", suffer economic breakdown and push the peoples of the Soviet Union to revolution. According to this theory, the rule of bureaucracy was leading to the alienation of the people from the power, a phenomenon that would continue even after the complete abolishment of capitalism. In the presence of the bureaucratic domination, such alienation was causing cultural degradation and limiting public life to rituals, borrowed from the arsenals of the bourgeois representative democracy (parliament, elections, the presence of one or more political parties (in the satellite countries of the Soviet Union: East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, China, North Korea, Vietnam), etc.). Imminent social tension created by the continuing alienation was acting as a psychological catalyst for the future revolution. The rule of bureaucracy, which represented the views of petit bourgeoisie, had led to the dominance of philistinism in all spheres of social life (everyday living, culture, professional activity, relations of production, formal politics) and to the annihilation of anti-bourgeois ideology and psychology. On the one hand, this was condemning the cultural and social life to stagnation and degradation; on the other ‚Äì was leading to the crisis of social relations ‚Äì the crisis, that the ruling regime could not resolve. Objectively, this was forcing the bureaucrats to \\"tighten the screws,\\" promote neo-Stalinism or, most likely, reestablish downright bourgeois relations, restore capitalism. Consequently, any legal revolutionary activity had become impossible, creating the necessary for an underground organization and underground struggle. The ruling soviet bureaucracy learnt from the events of the October Revolution of 1917. This is precisely why the representatives of the working class in the USSR (specifically those concentrated on large industrial enterprises) firstly, were a subject of particularly strong ideological control; secondly, the regime was constantly \\"flirting\\" with the workers, praising them and simultaneously imposing on them the ideology of ruling bureaucracy, corrupting them by mass culture; and thirdly, any attempts to create independent trade unions or other working class organizations were nipped in the bud. The information blockade was making it impossible for the workers to draw objective and outright conclusions about the real situation on the country; \\"brainwashing\\" (through propaganda and \\"political learning\\") did not allow them to develop their own ideology; the \\"canal system\\" of the social vertical mobility in the Soviet Union was enabling the most advanced and driven workers to obtain higher education and move to a different social category. Those were the main factors holding the working class from becoming the vanguard of the new revolution. Students, on the other hand, could become such vanguard, on account of being a social group whose position in the social structure of the soviet society was not yet secured; as a mobile group with wider access to information; finally, a group designated to intellectual activity. Besides, students could not be comfortable with the idea that after graduating from colleges and universities they were doomed to become ordinary, low paid employees, dependent on bureaucrats and, in the majority, with little prospect for growth. Control mechanisms among the young people were impaired by degeneration of the Komsomol (Russian: –í–õ–ö–°–ú) which could no longer play the role of the youth's leader. The above explains NCPSU strategy, based on propaganda specifically among students, as well as its particular interest in the \\"youth revolution\\" of the 1960s in the West, with an emphasis on studying the experience of student movement in the United States, France, Italy, South Korea). Thus, in early stages NCPSU acted on the premise that the USSR was in need of a political revolution, not the social one. By 1978 these ideological postulates no longer satisfied Tarasov's fellow party members, as well as himself. They were seriously criticized by N. Magnat, V. Minorsky, S. Trubkin, V. Makartsov. During 1978-1979 Tarasov developed for NCPSU a new, much more serious and original ideology. = Late period = See also *Post-Marxism *Samizdat References  Literature  * –¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å–æ–≤ –ê. –ù., –ß–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å–æ–≤ –ì. –Æ., –®–∞–≤—à—É–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¢. –í. \\"–õ–µ–≤—ã–µ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏: –æ—Ç —É–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–æ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤\\". ‚Äî –ú.: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç —ç–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å–æ—Ü–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏, 1997.

Denning LJ MR gave the leading judgment replacing the Rule of Strict Construction, which require a literal approach to the construction of contract terms. The Karsales decision allowed a court to override exemption clauses in contracts, if it appears that such clauses undermined the \\"fundamental obligations\\" of the parties. Although the case was the leading case for a decade, it has since lost much of its significance. Facts Mr. Wallis viewed a used Buick car that was being sold by Stinton for ‚Ç§600. Wallis found the car to be in excellent condition, and agreed that he would buy the car if Stinton would arrange financing through a hire-purchase company. Karsales (Harrow) Ltd. bought the car and sold it to Mutual Finance Ltd., which then finally supplied the car to Wallis on hire-purchase terms. Wallis had not seen the vehicle since his first viewing. The car was delivered not at the dealership, but instead was towed at night to the customer's house. The following morning, Wallis inspected the car and found it to be in a substantially different state than it was when he first saw the vehicle: the bumper was being held on by a rope, the new tires had been replaced by old ones, the radio was missing, as were chrome body trim strips. The car would not run, because the cylinder head (with bent and burnt valves) was lying loose upon the engine block. Wallis refused to pay for the car since it was not in the same condition as when he agreed to make the purchase. Judgment =Trial= Karsales sued Wallis for the remaining payments on the vehicle. Karsales relied on an exclusion clause in their contract, which stated that :\\"No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein.\\" The trial judge held that this clause did allow Karsales to recover the remaining costs from Wallis, and entered a judgment against him. =Court of Appeal= On appeal, Denning LJ reversed the trial judge's decision. He said the following. The Court added that despite the comprehensively-worded exemption clause in the contract, the dealer was nevertheless liable, as fundamentally this was a contract to sell \\"a car, a vehicle capable of self- propulsion\\"; so accordingly this Buick was \\"not a car\\". Significance =The \\"fundamental breach\\" doctrine= Denning LJ established a new precedent by declaring this a fundamental breach: that is, a breach that goes to the root of the contract, where the breach is so severe that there cannot be a contract after this breach.Karsales (Harrow) Ltd. v. Wallis, [1956] 1 W.L.R. 936 This decision set the precedent that goes against the strict construction rule. In strict construction, the rule is that the contract is intended to do what it says it will do, and that judges can only apply what the contract says within its own terms. Since the contract has been agreed upon by both parties, the contract is seen as representing both parties' interests. However, Denning ruled against this rule since it would not be fair for the consumer. =The doctrine challenged= Karsales v Wallis' concept of \\"fundamental breach\\" (aka \\"breach of a fundamental obligation) was essentially a restatement of the \\"Main Purpose Rule\\" established in Glynn v Margetson [1893] A.C. 351, the leading case on deviation in carriage of goods by sea. While the Main Purpose Rule The Main Purpose Rule provides that no exemption rule may cut into the main purpose of the contract (in this case, the main obligation was to carry the perishable cargo of seville oranges to an English marmalade factory with \\"due despatch\\"). still holds good in maritime law, it was deemed too wide for the general law of contract. The 1967 House of Lords decision of the Suisse AtlantiqueSuisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [1967] 1 AC 361 held that whether or not the breach was \\"fundamental\\" was not a matter of LAW but a question of CONSTRUCTION; \\"Construction\\" means \\"interpretation, from \\"construe\\". that is, exemption clauses might apply if the court's interpretation of the facts was that the exemption clause was not inappropriate.In the Suisse Atlantique, an absurdly low-level demurrage clause was indeed effectively an exemption of the charter's liability to pay daytime in full, but in the circumstances, the court construed that the shipowners had greater bargaining power, and if they omitted to provide for effective demurrage, more fool them.

The Act provides that some contract terms are VOID (such as limiting liability for causing death or injury through negligence), while others are \\"Valid only insofar as they are reasonable\\". \\"Reasonableness\\" was defined in the Act, which also provided some examples of reasonable and unreasonable terms.

It was written by Ron Cooper and published by Bancroft Press. Cooper's previous novel Hume's Fork, was released by Bancroft Press in 2007.  Summary  The novel focuses around three characters: Purvis Driggers, a 24-year-old unemployed man, Martha Umphlett, a divorced young woman made to live with the family she once escaped, and Brother Andrew, a monk devoted more to nature than God. Their stories intertwine through a series of events related to a murder, a love triangle, and the sightings of a legendary woodland figure known as the Hairy Man.  Reception  Ron Rash, author of Serena, said, ‚Äú Purple Jesus is a novel that deserves a place on the bookshelf between O'Connor's Wise Blood and Crews' The Gospel Singer , but Ron Cooper has his own unique voice, and what a marvelous, darkly comic voice it is.‚Äù Jay Parini, author of The Last Station, wrote, ‚ÄúPurvis Driggers, the novel's hero‚Äîif that word remotely connects to this bizarre figure on the bottom layer of a world that defies description‚Äîstays in the head, and he won't go away.

The highway has existed since at least 1914 and as SR-61 since at least 1937. Between 735 and 2,180 vehicles travel along the highway on an average day in 2012. Route description SR-61 in Lewiston At the intersection of SR-23 (4800 West) and 13400 North in the center of Cornish, SR-61 departs east on 13400 North due east, crossing over a single track belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). Exiting Cornish, the highway crosses the Bear River and continues east through rural Cache County. Just shy of the western city limits of Lewiston, the highway intersects SR-200 (800 West), a connector road to Preston, Idaho. From the western terminus to SR-200, the shoulder is up to wide, suitable for bicycling, however the remainder of the route has much narrower shoulders, between less than or equal to wide. The highway's name changes from 13400 South to Center Street through Lewiston. Passing the Lewiston Cemetery, SR-61 crosses over the Cub River and a second single track belonging to UP, and then a third UP single track just before the highway's eastern terminus at US-91 north of Richmond. All of the rail lines that SR-61 crosses originally belonged to the Oregon Short Line Railway. Aside from the segment through Lewiston, the highway is surrounded by farmland for its entire journey across northern Utah. Every year, UDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 735 vehicles used the highway on an average day at its western terminus in Cornish, and as many as 2,180 vehicles used the highway at its junction with SR-200. Thirty-five percent of this was truck traffic. History A roadway linking Cornish to the east has existed since at least 1914. The roadway that serves as the eastern terminus was numbered SR-1 by 1927, and the highway officially was designated SR-61 in 1931. The bridge that carries SR-61 over the Cub River today was constructed in 1952, while the bridge over the Bear River was built in 1961. The original river crossings were slightly further south than their current locations. Until 1953, SR-61 continued north to the Idaho border. This section was replaced by SR-23 in 1953.

Its purpose is to promote the healthy development of people under the age of 18 by restricting their access to published material that is considered inappropriate. The restrictions are primarily carried out through self- regulation by the publishing industry. The Ordinance was controversially revised in December 2010 to expand the definition of \\"harmful publications\\" and to give the Metropolitan government greater powers to enforce the law's provisions. Introduction According to Michiko Nagaoko, director of a non- profit organization in Kyoto called Juvenile Guide, founded in 2003, approximately half of the 2,000 pornographic animation titles distributed in Japan every year, including films and video games, feature schoolgirl characters. On 11 March 2008, UNICEF Japan issued a statement calling for further tightening of child pornography laws in Japan, including the ban of sexual depictions of minors in manga, anime and video games. Such a ban was not considered by Japan's officials at the time. =Sale of restricted works= Currently, works that are \\"restricted\\" under the ordinance bear a mark labeling them as or ; retailers are required to shelve such material separately from unrestricted works and to perform age-checks on purchasers of restricted material. Publisher self-regulation and retail compliance is administered by the , which is operated by the Japan Book Publishers Association. =\\"Nonexistent youth\\" bill= On 24 February 2010, the Metropolitan government submitted a proposed revision to the ordinance that would restrict sexually provocative depictions of fictional characters who appear to be under 18 years of age, referred to in the bill as . This proposal was criticised by many manga authors and received strong opposition from the publishing industry, the Writers Guild of Japan and the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, and was rejected by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly on 16 June 2010. Voting on the bill was put on hold until June, and Shintar≈ç Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, admitted that the bill's language needed revision. Despite revisions made which changed \\"nonexistent youths\\" to \\"depicted youths\\", the bill continued to be opposed by the Democratic Party of Japan and was rejected by the Assembly in June. Bill 156 After the original bill's defeat, Tokyo governor Shintar≈ç Ishihara announced his intent to submit a new revision later in the year. This revision, informally referred to as Bill 156, was submitted by the government in November 2010. It removed the controversial \\"non-existent youth\\" term but still proposed a number of significant changes to the law: * The Metropolitan government is given the authority to propose controls on internet access for children of different ages, although it is required to consult with the telecommunications industry, parents' representatives and educators. * The definition of harmful material is expanded to include \\"any manga, animation, or pictures (but not including real life pictures or footage) that features either sexual or pseudo sexual acts that would be illegal in real life, or sexual or pseudo sexual acts between close relatives whose marriage would be illegal, where such depictions and/or presentations unjustifiably glorify or exaggerate the activity.\\" * Any publisher who has more than six works declared harmful under the new criteria in a 12-month period can be referred to the relevant industry self-regulation body. If the publisher breaches the criteria again within the next six months, the Governor can publicly identify the offender and comment on the reasons for declaring their work in breach. * The Metropolitan government is authorised to \\"encourage the establishment of an environment where child pornography could be eliminated and prevent its creation.\\" The bill specifically mentions \\"any sexually arousing posing on the behalf of children under the age of 13 wholly or partially naked, or wearing swimwear or only underwear, published in books or featured in film,\\" although as with its other provisions this only applies to drawings and animation, not to photography or film of real children. * The bill affirms the Metropolitan government's role in promoting safe use of the internet and increasing awareness of risks the medium poses. * Internet filtering services to protect children from harmful content must be more widely accessible. Parents who wish to remove filtering from their children's mobile phones must submit a written request to their phone service provider, and this request must be for reasons the Metropolitan government considers justified. * Parents and guardians must take responsibility for ensuring children in their care use the internet in a safe manner that limits their exposure to harmful material. Like its predecessor the bill was opposed by many writers, publishers and lawyers. However, the Japanese Parent Teacher Association expressed its support for the changes. Bill 156 was approved by the Metropolitan Assembly's general affairs committee on 13 December 2010 and passed by the full Assembly two days later. The committee added a non-binding clause to the bill that calls on regulators to take into account \\"merits based on artistic, social, educational, and satirical criticism criteria\\" when evaluating publications under the revised law. Only two small political parties, the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Seikatsusha Network, opposed the bill. The revised law took full effect on 1 July 2011. =Passage= A revised edition was presented in November to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, which would require self-regulation of \\"'manga, anime and other images'...that 'unjustifiably glorify or emphasize' certain sexual or pseudo sexual acts\\"...depictions of 'sexual or pseudo sexual acts that would be illegal in real life'\\". However, the bill no longer uses the term nonexistent youth and applies to all characters and to material that is not necessarily meant to be sexually stimulating. On 13 December 2010 it passed through committee. It was approved in December and will take full effect in July 2011. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office for Youth Affairs and Public Safety, the bill does not regulate mobile sites or downloaded and is only intended for publications such as books and DVDs. =Industry opposition= The original proposal was criticized by a group of manga artists, who prepared a statement for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly signed by many anime and manga industry personnel opposing the legislation. After Bill 156 passed through committee, Shueisha's management tried to calm worries for new manga artists. According to Anime News Network (ANN), at the New Manga Creators Awards ceremony Kazuhiko Torishima, senior managing director and editor, said he wanted \\"new manga authors to produce manga that would blow away [Tokyo Governor] Shintaro Ishihara\\" and Masahiko Ibaraki, editor-in-chief of its third editorial department, added that he did not want the increased regulations to have a chilling effect on their content and they would still feature anything that was exciting. In addition, the Mobile Content Forum and a group of female yaoi authors voiced their opposition. Takeshi Nogami announced the publication of an anti-Ordinance d≈çjinshi at Comiket 79, entitled An Idiot's Guide to Tokyo's Harmful Books Regulation. The all-ages d≈çjin sold out its first printing of over 1000 copies and went into a second printing; it will be officially translated into English & released online. In a blog post on 13 December 2010, the Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan expressed concern about the impact of the boycott and urged the parties involved to work towards resolving the situation. The Association of Japanese Animations (AJA) along with the and several Japanese anime and manga publishers have voiced opposition to the bill. For its part, the AJA has voiced concerns the bill has major freedom of expression problems which are guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan. Specifically, the bill's scope and its vague requirements. In addition, the AJA said that they did not receive prior notice or hearings on the matter even though the bill deals with anime and thus it did not receive due process. In response to the bill, Comic 10 Society has said it will boycott the 2011 Tokyo International Anime Fair organized by the AJA which, according to AJA, threatens the event's quality. Shueisha has asked anime production companies to pull its material and asked other publishers to do the same. In response, Shogakukan and Kodansha posted similar responses. Other vendors have backed out of the fair in response to the bill with rented space down 20%. The resulting cancellations TAF lowered its expectations ¬•110 million (about US$1.3 million). According to ANN, the Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan wrote in his blog about the concerns of TAF's cancellation. =Enforcement= After some publishers asked for a list of standards required by the newly revised bill before they start the sale of a book, Mika Sakurai, the section chief of youth affairs at the Office for Youth Affairs and Public Safety, stated that the publishers can ask the government whether or not a specific work is subject to the law before sale, but a response might not be immediate as \\"the assessment may not be clear until release\\". On 14 April 2011, a list of the first six titles to be \\"considered for restrictions\\" under the bill was published in the magazine Weekly Playboy, based on materials presented by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government during meetings with the Council on Publishing Ethics. The works listed include five seinen titles and one sh≈çjo title, with reasons for restriction varying from \\"rape\\" and \\"incest\\" to \\"sexual intercourse in a school building\\". One week after the meeting, Masahiro Itosugi, the author of the listed work Aki Sora, announced that there would be no further reprints of volumes 1 and 3 of the manga after the law goes into effect in July 2011. In March 2013, manga artist Yuzupon claimed on their Twitter account that the first volume of their work Welcome to Sugarpot, which was released about a month earlier, had been withdrawn from stores due to the Tokyo bill. The volume was still available digitally; the ordinance does not apply to digital sales. In May 2014, the Imouto Paradise 2 manga became the first work to officially be restricted as \\"unhealthy\\" in Tokyo under the 2010 revisions to the youth law for \\"glorifying incestuous acts\\".

Geography Komaripalem is located in Biccavolu Mandal, East Godavari District. It has an average elevation of 13 meters (42.65 feet). It is famous for making of firecrackers, especially hand- made rockets, and flower pots. History Long ago there was an ancient town named Gowripatnam padu. It was a big town in Rajamahendravaram kingdom. It often suffered from natural disasters like earthquakes and droughts. The people made a number of big ponds to store water. At the last stage of township the people had nothing to eat. They tried to eat even soil to control their hunger. They felt that it was very hard to stay there, and decided to shift from the town. The people went in different directions and made small villages as per their requirements and comfort. Many people who had great affection for the town settled very nearby and made a village. They felt this new village was a son of the old town. As per Hindu stories, Kumaraswamy is the only natural born son of Gowri devi. Therefore, they put the village name as \\"Kumarapalem\\". With time passing and different pronunciations the name gradually changed to Komaripalem. Everywhere one can find a village goddess in or near the village. However, Komaripalem people still give priority to the Gowripatnampadu town goddess Gogulamma, located 5 km from the village. They also offer pujas to the village goddess Dosalamma. One can still find three very small ponds near Gogulamma temple named Enugula Cheruvu, Kanikela Cheruvu, etc. One can also find some big rocks which were used as temple bricks. Present Komaripalem is well known for fire crakers, super markets and rice mills. \\"Sri Mahalakshmi super Bazar\\" is the biggest super market located at Y-Junction Komaripalem village.

Controversies Charges of corruption in the Telangana's medical and health department surfaced and indicated Madiga Deputy Chief Minister Thaikonda Rajaiah's involvement or 'tacit ignorance' of illegal actions in the department. While Rajaiah's dismissal appeared to have been on the cards for quite a time since September, 2014 when he promised a Health University for Warangal seemingly without Telangana CM Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar's direction. Chief minister's political secretary S Subhash Reddy said, \\"The developments were on expected lines. The matter of corruption charges against a minister is a serious one.\\" Rajaiah has earned the dubious distinction of being the First Minister in Telangana to be sacked. Allegations of corruption against the health and medical department include irregularities in recruitment of para-medical staff and purchase of ambulance vehicles. In a last ditch effort to defend himself, Rajaiah had written to the chief minister seeking forgiveness for his omissions and commissions, but to no avail. On Jan 25, 2015, before Republic Day, Rajaiah was \\"supposedly\\" sacked for his behavior. His duties were transferred to a Bindla caste member (non-madiga) member Kadiyam Srihari who is also from Warangal, in order not to lose the Scheduled Caste vote bank. Mr. Srihari was considered the hidden hand behind the Madiga movement for categorisation of Scheduled Castes though he belonged to the Baindla community which is considered lower in strata than Madigas. January 2015 Speaking to scribes after spending one night at Manchiryal area hospital as a part of his visit to Adilabad district said there is nothing wrong in hospital staff demanding Rs 100 and Rs 200. He said one shouldn't look at them as corrupt people and one shouldn't complain calling the authorities. He said only if someone pesters patients, people can complain them to RDO or Collectors calling them over phone. Rajaiah even changed his statements on swine flu deaths. Rajaiah who said five people were killed due to swine flu till yesterday now said there are no deaths due to swine flu. September 2014 During an event in Warangal, Thatikonda Rajaiah promised a Health University for Warangal seemingly without Telangana CM Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar's direction. Speaking in the same event, CM KCR had rebuked Thatikonda Rajaiah by saying, \\"ollu daggara pettukuni matladu\\", which did not go well among the Madiga caste members including Manda Krishna Madiga leader of the vetti-chakiri oppressed section of the Telangana. It was aired that KCR did not want any of his ministers to make promises, since he wants to take credit for all the schemes and programmes. In his complaint, Bakka Judson, TPCC secretary, objected KCR's use of 'ollu daggara pettukuni matladu', loosely translated as 'mind your language' by KCR claiming that it insulted Dr T Rajaiah, a Dalit Christian. \\"Deputy chief minister Dr T Rajaiah belongs to SC (madiga) caste. The remark made by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao was in bad taste,\\" Bakka Judson said in his complaint before National Commission for SC. Madiga Community's Response Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) founder president Manda Krishna on Monday lashed out at Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for sacking Deputy Chief Minister T. Rajaiah and said it amounted to insulting the community on the whole. While not exactly spelling out his future course of action, the MRPS leader said he would chalk out an action plan on the ouster of Dr. Rajaiah soon but reiterated that the ‚ÄòMadigas‚Äô would not rest until justice was done. He regretted that Dr. Rajaiah was not even given an opportunity to explain his position. ‚ÄúThe way he was denied even an appointment with the Chief Minister and removed solely on the basis of an allegation is mysterious and that is what is insulting,‚Äù he said. The fight of the weaker sections has always been for self-esteem alone and the way Dr. Rajaiah was unceremoniously shown the door only holds mirror to the continued oppression of the weaker sections by upper castes, he said, adding that they would take the struggle forward. The Chief Minister owed people an explanation of how and under what circumstances Dr. Rajaiah was removed and the demand for an apology for such a treatment was justified, Mr. Krishna said. Hospitalized Rajaiah suffered Heart Attack and was admitted in Hyderguda Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad on 27-01-2015. The former Deputy Chief Minister who was sacked by Telangana ChiefMinister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday on the charges of corruption in the Health Department, was hospitalized on Tuesday evening after complaining pain in the chest.

Included with the false crown is planning to rob an armored car. Batman catches False-Face, who is disguised as one of the armored car drivers but manages to escape in his Trick-Truck.

The police arrive in time to arrest the gang, but False-Face escapes by disguising himself as Chief O'Hara, before gassing the real Chief O'Hara. Batman captures False-Face's assistant, Blaze, who leads the duo to what they think is False-Face's hideout, a deserted subway platform. It is in reality a False-Face trap.

The trail passes between Stevens Mine on a lower slope of McClellan Mountain, 13,587 feet, forming the eastern wall of the valley, and Sterling Silver Group Mine beside the trail to the right on Kelso Mountain, 13,164 feet. The trail climbs 900 feet during the first 1.7 miles to a National Recreation Trail sign indicating that the summit is two miles farther. From the saddle between Grays and Torreys, Stevens Gulch is within sight. The Keystone Resort slopes of Keystone Mountain, 11,641 feet, North Peak, 11,661, and South Peak, 11,982, are west of Grays Peak. Grays Peak, 14,270 feet, and Mount Edwards, 13,850 feet, form the ridge that is the Continental Divide of the Americas east of Torreys Peak. Wildlife in the area includes mountain goat, pika, cougar or mountain lion, mule deer, elk, marmot, coyote, ptarmigan, American red squirrel, and Canada jay. Wildflowers that bloom in the tundra area on the Continental Divide include moss campion (Silene acaulis), alpine forget-me-not (Myosotis alpestris), sky pilot (Polemonium viscosum), sea pink, old-man-of-the-mountain (Rydbergia grandiflora), and mountain gentian (Gentiana). In the Deer Creek Valley, below the tree-line, the blooms of monkshood or wolfsbane, blue columbine, fireweed, and paintbrush (Castilleja) can be found.

This product may be liquid, gaseous or multiphase hydrocarbons, water, steam, CO2, N2, petrol, aviation fuel etc. Pre-commissioning is the series of processes carried out on the pipeline before the final product is introduced. The process during which the pipeline is made \\"live\\" i.e. the product is put in the pipeline, is called pipeline commissioning or start-up. Despite being seen as an offshoot, or minor part of the business for the larger oil service companies, the pipeline pre-commissioning industry possesses quite a large portfolio of services including, but not limited to the following services: Pipeline Cleaning ‚Äì this is carried out by pushing pigs or gel pigs through the pipeline to remove any debris buildup or corrosion. Pipeline Gauging ‚Äì this is carried out to prove the dimensional quality of the internal diameter of the pipeline. Pipeline Filling (Flooding) ‚Äì which can be carried out by propelling pigs through the pipeline with water or free flooding with water (normally for smaller or unpiggable pipelines). Hydrotesting ‚Äì this is a process by which the pipeline in question is pressure tested to a predefined pressure above the operating design pressure of the pipeline. Dewatering ‚Äì this involves pushing pigs through the pipeline propelled by a gas to remove the water prior to start-up. Other services include vacuum drying, degassing, pneumatic testing, barrier testing, leak testing, decommissioning to mention but a few. On the pipeline process pre-commissioning side, there are various services such as chemical cleaning, helium leak detection, bolting, hot oil flushing, pipe freezing, foam inerting etc... Other services include valve testing, umbilical testing, hot tapping, leak metering, riser annulus testing.

Anastasia: The Lost Princess. Regnery Gateway. , pp. 35-36 Biography She was born on May 2, 1874 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, the daughter of Stephen Turner Rives and Mary Ragsdale. Her father was from a prominent Virginia family. She was a distant cousin of the novelist and poet Am√©lie Rives Troubetzkoy. An author's biography in one of her books notes that her father, who had fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War and spent two years in a Northern prison camp, had \\"made her his little comrade\\" when she was a child and she was an excellent rifle shot and a bareback rider who was called \\"the Rives' little wildcat\\" by outsiders. Her father allowed her to spend so much time outdoors because her mother had been an invalid in the years before she died. Rives wrote her first novel at age eight, though her writing was not encouraged by her parents. Her first novel was published when she was eighteen. In her novels she addressed politics between the Northern and Southern United States, issues of race, and sex, causing great debate among critics. Among them was Smoking Flax (1897), a novel controversial even at the time, which takes a favorable position on lynching. The novel is about an African American man accused of raping and murdering a white woman who was lynched after the governor commuted his sentence to life. Many of her novels were bestsellers. Other books she wrote were better received by critics than Smoking Flax. Her novel, The Castaway, is noted for being the subject of a Supreme Court copyright case, Bobbs-Merrill v. Straus, in which the US Supreme Court recognized the first sale doctrine, permitting purchasers of copies of books to resell them without seeking permission from the copyright holder.Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339 (1908). She married Wheeler in 1906 in Tokyo. A wedding announcement noted that Wheeler initially considered Rives \\"rather severe on men\\" in her books and she considered him \\"none too charitable concerning the faults of women\\" in his book Reflections of a Bachelor. They met at a reception in New York and began a friendship that eventually led to marriage. She accompanied him to posts across Europe, Asia and South America throughout his career in foreign service. She and her husband co-wrote Dome of Many-Coloured Glass in 1952 about their lives in the United States Foreign Service. She died on August 16, 1956 in New York City, New York. Her widower died on Christmas Eve, December 23, 1956 at the Frances Convalescent Home in Neptune, New Jersey, just 4 months later.

A demo tape of the band's first songs, was quickly spread through Bogot√°'s metal fans in 1994. The band created a reputation of strong and fierce live shows, which was recorded in the first live album published by a Colombian band, Live All the Time in 1995, featuring two cover songs: Pantera's \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" and Sepultura's \\"Propaganda\\". Agony's first studio album, entitled Millennium, was recorded at Audiovision studios in Bogot√°, released in 1996 and later re-released in 2006, with C√©sar Botero on vocals, Andr√©s Jaramillo and Carlos Mar√≠n on guitars, Carlos Reyes on bass, and Alfonso Pinz√≥n on drums.

After the first show in American ground, at the famous Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, and with Juanes filling in for Reyes on bass, Mar√≠n left the band. Their second album, Reborn, was recorded at Cornerstone Recorders with producer Tom Fletcher, mixed by Rich Renken and released in 2002 on Sum Records.

Later the cemetery was opened to civilian burials as well. Garrison Cemetery is an independent cemetery, managed by the parochial church council, placed under the army's highest authority. History Originally named Soldaterkirkeg√•rden (Soldiers' Cemetery), Garrison Cemetery was founded by a decree from King Frederick III and laid out in 1664 on a site outside the Bastioned Fortifications, next to the main road leading in and out of the Eastern City Gate and opposite the naval Holmens Cemetery which was laid out around the same time. Burials began the same year but the site, former marshland, was rather unsuitable for the purpose since ground water levels made it hard to bury the bodies in sufficiently deep grounds. In 1671, some improvements were made when the site was enclosed by pallisades and ditches and the cemetery was officially inaugurated on 13 July 1671. Detail from old map showing the location of Garrison Cemetery outside the Eastern City Gate During the first decades, the cemetery remained relatively little used. In 1706, the Garrison Church was built on Sankt Ann√¶ Plads. and in 1723 the Soldiers' Cemetery received its current name. In 1711, Copenhagen was struck by an outbreak of plague which killed an estimated 23,000 citizens. In a move to control disease, the authorities provided that all victims of the plague, within 24 hours and without a ceremony, had to be buried at Garrison Cemetery or a Municipal Plague Cemetery which was set up next to it. In 1720, Garrison Cemetery was officially opened to civilian burials. The cemetery was neglected and gradually fell into despair. In 1812 it was renovated and from then on began to attract more prominent citizens. Garrison Cemetery today One of the many characteristics of the cemetery, are the many old graves, still owned by families, and war-monuments of fallen in the wars 1848‚Äì1850 and 1864.

Biography He was born on August 6, 1869 in Owego, New York. His parents were Rev. Henry Wheeler and Mary Sparkes Wheeler. Wheeler was a foreign correspondent in Paris and Morocco following his graduation from Princeton University in 1891. He passed the first examinations given in 1906 for the United States Foreign Service and went on to serve as a career diplomat between 1906 and 1934. Wheeler married the novelist Hallie Erminie Rives in 1906 in Tokyo. A wedding announcement noted that Wheeler initially considered the Kentucky-born Rives \\"rather severe on men\\" in her books and she considered him \\"none too charitable concerning the faults of women\\" in his book Reflections of a Bachelor. They met at a reception in New York and began a friendship that eventually led to marriage. He was the second secretary of the United States legation to Japan between 1906 and 1909; served at the American Embassy in Saint Petersburg, Russia between 1906 and 1911 and at the American Embassy in Rome between 1912 and 1913. He returned to Japan as Charge d'Affairs between 1914 and 1916 and was later counselor at the American Embassy in Tokyo. He went on to serve on the American Legation in Stockholm, Sweden between 1917 and 1920; in London between 1921 and 1924; and in Rio de Janeiro in 1929. He was envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Paraguay between 1929 and 1933 and to Albania between 1933 and 1934. He died on Christmas Eve, December 23, 1956 at the Frances Convalescent Home in Neptune, New Jersey. His age was 87 years. Legacy Wheeler published a number of books and short pieces over his lifetime, including works of poetry and humor, as well as collections of Russian, Albanian, and Hawaiian folklore. He also collected a number of Japanese rakugo tales to be published in a ten-volume work entitled H≈ç-Dan-Z≈ç (Treasure-Tale Storehouse), but the work was never published due to the United States' entry into World War II. The manuscript now resides in the New York Public Library. He and his wife wrote Dome of Many-Coloured Glass in 1952 about their experiences serving in the United States Foreign Service.

Synopsis Maigret is a few years short of his retirement and has just refused promotion to the post of Head of the Police Judiciare, preferring the human contact he enjoys as Head of the Criminal Division. His wish is granted when Madam Nathalie Sabin-Levesque, an elegant but highly nervous lady insists that he personally investigates the disappearance of her husband Gƒórard, a highly successful and rich Parisian lawyer. With the assistance of various other detectives, but principally Lapointe, Maigret soon discovers that Madam Sabin-Levesque is virtually an alcoholic and has lived an effectively separate life from her husband, who regularly vanishes for days or weeks to take up with various girls. These are mostly hostesses picked up in bars and cabarets, and he is known to them as 'Monsieur Charles'. It further emerges that his wife was also a call-girl in her youth, although she has claimed to be a legal secretary. She hoped for a life of comfort and security with her new husband, who owned a villa in Cannes and inherited money, but they soon grew to ignore and despise each other. She knows nothing of his professional life and is not well liked by the staff at the practice. When Gƒórard's body is fished out of the Seine, Maigret's suspicions fall on her. But she is also being blackmailed by pimp-turned-barman-turned-gigolo Joe Fazio, her sometime lover. It turns out that Fazio killed Gƒórard and that Nathalie then killed Fazio. Maigret somewhat reluctantly arrests Nathalie, knowing that she is in poor health and will spend time in the prison hospital. Publication history The French title was first published in 1972.

She was known for appearing in Maxim and competing on two ABC reality shows, The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love and Bachelor Pad. Career =Modeling and acting= Gia Marie Allemand was born to Eugene and Donna Allemand in the Howard Beach neighborhood of Queens, New York City, and grew up in the borough of Staten Island and nearby in suburban Manorville, New York, on Long Island, where she graduated from Lindenhurst High School in 2001. Allemand's parents separated in 1992, later divorcing; Donna Allemand married Tony Micheletti, whom she described as closer to Gia than was Gia's biological father. Gia began modeling early, and as a baby she appeared in Johnson & Johnson ads and as a Gerber Baby. As a teenager, Allemand initially never thought about a career in modeling. However, at 19 she began modeling after she was asked to enter a swimsuit competition that she won. Allemand finished second in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic competition and the Miss Red Hot Taj Mahal Super Bowl contest in 2005. She is best known for appearing as a swimsuit model in Maxim in 2007. In 2008, she was named Miss Bikini-USA's Model of the Year. The following year Allemand placed first in the bikini short class of the NPC Arnold Amateur Championships. In addition to modeling, Allemand worked for the modeling and creative-fields consultancy Dream It Make It. Allemand said in an interview that she has always had a passion for acting and performing. She was a former professional ballet dancer, but her dancing career was shortened after she injured her hamstring and Achilles tendon. Nevertheless, Allemand took acting classes in high school and at Hartford College. In 2010, she was selected to play a role in an upcoming film produced by Brett Ratner on the life of actor Gianni Russo. She was cast to play the supporting role of actress Ava Gardner. Russo cast her for the role saying, \\"Gia looks a lot like Ava, but it's really the passion that she had that convinced me to cast her.\\" =Television= Allemand's work in television began when she was selected as a cast member on ABC's reality show The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love, season 14 of The Bachelor series, which first aired on January 4, 2010. The show placed her with 24 other women all contending for the affection of pilot Jake Pavelka. She was the second to the last contestant eliminated by Pavelka. On February 18, 2010 Allemand appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she discussed her life after being on The Bachelor. Afterwards, Allemand joined the cast of ABC's Bachelor spinoff, Bachelor Pad. The show premiered August 9, 2010, on ABC. Allemand cited an existing relationship as the reason she refused to participate in the show's \\"kissing contest\\" game which led to her elimination in the third episode. Before appearing on Bachelor Pad Allemand was featured in a special edition of ABC's 20/20: Inside the Bachelor: Stories Behind the Rose. Allemand appeared in the episodic short film Ghost Trek: The Kinsey Report, a horror-comedy about a paranormal reality show, in which Allemand plays the role of producer Shawna Leibowitz. Death On August 12, 2013, Allemand was admitted to University Hospital in New Orleans after an attempted suicide by hanging. She was declared brain dead and removed from life support two days later at the age of 29. At the time of her death, she was living in New Orleans and dating NBA player Ryan Anderson, who was playing for the New Orleans Pelicans. Gia had a disorder known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Her longtime publicist, Penelope Jean Hayes, was interviewed by Phil McGraw on Dr. Phil on the topic of Allemand's suicide and the pressures of celebrity, image, and finding love and happiness. A video tribute for Allemand aired during a 2014 episode of The Bachelor. Her funeral was held at Trinity Grace Church, a nondenominational Christian church in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

Founded later than many other Catholic parishes in the heavily Catholic region of western Ohio, it owns a complex of buildings constructed in the early 20th century that have been designated historic sites because of their architecture. Leading among them is its massive church, built in the Romanesque Revival style just 43 years after the first Catholic moved into the city: it has been called northwestern Ohio's grandest church building. Parish history Catholics were active in southern Mercer County by the 1830s; St. John the Baptist parish in Maria Stein and St. Rose parish in St. Rose were established in 1837,Scranton, S.S. History of Mercer County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Chicago: Biographical, 1907. and St. Henry parish in St. Henry and St. Joseph parish in St. Joe were also founded before 1840. Despite the growing Catholic presence to the south, the county seat was strongly Protestant in its early history: when it was platted in 1834, the proprietors donated lots for the use of congregations of the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian faiths, and not a single Catholic was resident in the village for more than a quarter of a century. Beginning with Owen Gallagher in 1860, Catholics began to migrate into Celina, and starting in 1864, Mass was celebrated biweekly in a factory owned by one of the members. At this time, no priest lived in Celina; the celebrant was typically Joseph Gregory Dwenger, then the pastor of Holy Rosary parish in nearby St. Marys.Mercer County, Ohio History 1978. Celina: Mercer County Historical Society, 1978, 525. A parish was formally erected in Celina in 1864 and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.Fortin, Roger. Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati 1821-1996 . Columbus: Ohio State UP, 2002, 401. With the creation of the parish, more Catholics were attracted to Celina; the parish grew to the point that a church building was needed, and the Archbishop of Cincinnati, John Baptist Purcell, came to Celina to lay the cornerstone on August 3, 1864. Members subscribed to the building fund throughout that year and the following; it was completed in November 1865, and Joseph Dwenger dedicated it on December 8, 1865. This building was a brick structure, measuring approximately by ; it cost $7,000 to build. However, the parish continued to grow, and a building fund for a new edifice was started in 1899. Construction of the replacement church building began in the following year, and it was dedicated in 1903 at a cost of $52,000. In the early twentieth century, it was widely considered the finest church building in all of northwestern Ohio, and decades later, its architecture still dominates all of downtown Celina. Since the parish's earliest years, members of the Missionaries of the Precious Blood have provided pastoral care for the members; Dwenger was a member of this society, as were the other five priests who served there in its first decade. The first priest to live in Celina was Theopistus Wittmer, who arrived in 1876; the members acquired a small frame house to use as a rectory. Soon after Wittmer's arrival, the parish constructed a building for their parochial school. The structure built for this school was two stories tall and measured approximately by ; it replaced a frame building in which the school had started in 1871.Grieshop, Shelley. IC school seeks help to stay afloat, The Daily Standard, 2010-03-24. Accessed 2011-01-05. A convent was built in 1879 to house the first of the Sisters of the Precious Blood, who came in that year to teach at the parish school; it was replaced by a larger structure in 1949, located northeast of the rest of the buildings related to the parish. Today, Immaculate Conception continues to be an active parish in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. It is clustered with Our Lady of Guadalupe parish in Montezuma and St. Theresa, Little Flower of Jesus parish in Rockford; all three churches are part of the St. Marys Deanery.The Futures Project, Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Accessed 2011-01-04. Buildings =Church= Interior circa 1910 The church itself is a large brick building constructed in the shape of a Greek cross; it was designed by Andrew DeCurtins of Lima and built under the supervision of John Burkhart of Kenton. A Romanesque Revival structure erected in 1903, it is centered on a large bronze dome. Worshippers may enter the building through its eastern end; the facade is pierced by three large doorways and a massive rose window. Capping the facade are two square towers; each one includes an octagonal belfry and is topped with a smaller bronze dome. Inside, the church is heavily decorated; many of the walls feature paintings, and the altar is distinctly Romanesque in its style. The entire building rests on a stone foundation with a basement.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Celina. Ohio Historical Society, February 1977. Architectural historians have grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four different generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings from the first years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 in a wide range of styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.Brown, Mary Ann and Mary Niekamp. '. National Park Service, July 1978. Accessed 2010-05-30. =Rectory= Front of the rectory Located immediately west of the church, the Immaculate Conception rectory is a large square three-story brick house. It is the third residence to serve as the parish's rectory: members bought a frame house near the church in 1876, and after a new school building was completed in 1889, the priest moved into the old school. In 1908, the parish spent $2,000 to buy land from John Schlosser immediately west of the church;Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Immaculate Conception Rectory. Ohio Historical Society, February 1977. on this land they built the present rectory for $10,000. Divided into three bays on the front and six bays on each side, it sits on a foundation of cut stone with a stone water table and a basement. Individuals may enter through a large entryway on the southern front of the house or through a smaller doorway on the rear of the eastern side of the house. Dominating the appearance of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting from the front of the house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes. =Elementary school= The school in the morning Sitting immediately north of the church is the Immaculate Conception Elementary School, which was erected in 1918 at a cost of $70,000. Two stories tall and built of brick with a flat asphalt roof, it is divided into sixteen bays on each of its two sides. Among its leading architectural features are a central projection on its eastern front, the arched doorway in that projection, and ornamental panels around the entrance. The school occupies the site of an earlier school that was built in 1889; the present building was constructed because the previous structure had become too small. In its early years, the present building housed both the elementary school and the high school, which was only a three-year course for its first ten years. Because of continued growth in the high school, a new building was constructed specifically for it on the opposite side of the street. The architect for the elementary school was an unknown member of the DeCurtins family, who was related to the designer of the church building, Andrew DeCurtins.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Celina I.C. Elementary School. Ohio Historical Society, February 1977. Unlike the newer building,Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Ninth Grade Building-Celina City Schools Celina Immaculate Conception School. Ohio Historical Society, February 1977. the old elementary school remains a functioning school building. Due to falling enrollment and increasing expenses, the school was losing significant amounts of money by the late 2000s. Operating the school cost $874,243 in the 2008-2009 school year, while income was only $375,459. In 2010, the church announced that it would close the school at the end of the 2010-2011 school year unless finances improved markedly. =High school= Front of the former high school Located on the eastern side of Walnut Street across from the other buildings of the church complex, the former Immaculate Conception High School was built in 1933 under the supervision of William and Joseph Forsthoff. The building was designed by Fred DeCurtins, a relative of the architect who designed the church building, and the nephew of the architect who designed the elementary school. Members of the DeCurtins family, who lived primarily in the community of Carthagena, designed many churches and other religious buildings in Mercer County and the surrounding region, including the area's first church built with a tall tower, St. Aloysius' Church in Carthagena. Although Fred DeCurtins designed the church building constructed in 1937 for the new parish in the northern Mercer County village of Rockford, architectural historians believe that Immaculate Conception High School was the last building designed by the DeCurtins family for an entity connected to the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. The school closed at the end of the 1972 school year, and by the late 1970s, the parish no longer needed its high school building; although it remained in church ownership, it was leased for use by the Celina City School District for use as a ninth-grade academy. Three stories tall, the high school is a brick and stone building constructed on a concrete foundation with a basement and topped with a flat composite roof. Its overall shape is that of a square, divided into thirteen bays on the front and sixteen bays on the sides. The first floor of its west-facing main facade is pierced by the large main entrance, which features an arched entrance with a cross-tipped stone gable at the top. A similar entrance is present on the building's southern side. Among its most prominent architectural features are eight stone columns on the main facade, which bracket groups of five windows on each story. These columns rise to different heights, creating a distinctive vertical effect. Such a style is common among more conservative modernist architects, who wish to combine older designs with current trends: historic elements are simplified and given a modernist style.McCormick, Virginia E. Educational Architecture in Ohio: From One-Room Schools and Carnegie Libraries to Community Education Villages. Kent: Kent State UP, 2001, 112. The church chancel and apse Recognition In 1977, the church, rectory, and schools were recorded by a historic preservation program run by the Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and the high school and rectory in good condition. Although no historic preservation program was in effect, no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated. Two years later, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of the well-preserved and historically significant architecture of its buildings. At the same time, the same designation was given to more than thirty other churches and other buildings in far western Ohio that were related to the Missionaries of the Precious Blood, using the multiple property submission process. Centered on the community of Maria Stein, the location of the Convent of Mary, Help of Christians, this predominately Catholic region is dotted with many large Romanesque Revival or Gothic Revival churches whose tall spires rise above tiny communities and can be seen from miles around.

It was formed in 2010 by several former Reform Party members. The party has the objective of establishing a socialist state in Singapore should it be elected to government. The current Socialist Front had no affiliation with the similarly named Barisan Sosialis party which existed from 1961 to 1988.  History  = Founding = The Socialist Front was formed in 2010 by Mr Chia Ti Lik, a lawyer who had contested in the 2006 Election as a Workers' Party candidate in East Coast, and Mr Ng Teck Siong, an opposition veteran who resigned from the Reform Party. Mr Chia was chosen as the founding secretary-general, with Mr Ng taking the position of founding chairman. During the party's press conference on 29 October 2010, the party unveiled its current emblem: a five pointed red star which symbolizes democracy, equality, peace, progress and justice. The emblem espouses the objective of the party to achieve the above-mentioned goals through national unity.  Ideology and Objectives  The party's ideology was presented during the media conference on 29 October 2010. According to the Socialist Front's secretary-general Mr Chia Ti Lik, the party has several objectives: * To further the fundamental rights and liberties of Singaporeans; * To contest the Parliamentary Elections and establish a socialist government for the benefit of Singaporeans; * To encourage ownership and active participation of Singaporeans in the affairs and politics of the country; * To make Singapore a home for all Singaporeans based on the Socialist model; * To do all ancillary and related acts which espouse and promote the aforesaid objectives. The party's objectives had been drawn from a socialist ideology, namely from the belief of setting economic and political policies for the good of the common people, the principle of \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\\", and lastly, equal opportunities to all citizens to allow them to maximize their fullest potential.  Structure  The Socialist Front was governed by a Central Executive Committee (CEC) elected by the party's cadre members. The CEC comprised as below: * Mr Ng Teck Siong, chairman * Mr Chia Ti Lik, secretary- general * Mr Mansor Rahman, treasurer * Mr Ng Pian Ying, member * Mr Ng Soin Liang, member * Mr Lim Mie, member  Electoral Results  = General Election 2011 = The Socialist Front was set to contest its first General Election held on 7 May 2011. The Party's chairman Ng Teck Siong indicated that the party planned to contest several single member constituencies (SMCs) in the elections, although he declined to name the wards as the electoral boundaries were not known yet. By the time the electoral boundaries were confirmed, the party had split over whether to contest or stay out. Mr Ng indicated that it would contest some SMCs, in particular Mountbatten SMC. However, secretary-general Mr Chia Ti Lik announced that the party would not take part in the election to avoid contesting against other opposition parties in three cornered fights. Mr Ng, with some members from the Singapore Democratic Alliance, then prepared to contest in Tanjong Pagar GRC as independent candidates. They failed to do so as they were late for nomination by 35 seconds. This resulted in Tanjong Pagar GRC being the only uncontested constituency in the 2011 election. Party treasurer Mr Mansor Rahman resigned from the Socialist Front to join the Reform Party and contested in Ang Mo Kio GRC, but did not win. Soon after the elections, the Socialist Front became dormant.

History Attempts at BYU to offer continuing education programs date back to Karl G. Maeser offering night classes to workers at the Provo Woolen Mills in 1876. However night classes and other attempts to reach out to non-matriculated students were haphazard through the next few decades. The Polysophical Society was organized in 1877 to give lectures open to the general public. At first most of the lectures were given by students. By 1903 the program was organized as the lyceum program with John C. Swensen as its director and most of the lectures were either by BYU faculty or by professors and lecturers invited from elsewhere. The DCE as an organization began in 1921 when Franklin S. Harris, BYU's president, organized the Extension Division. Lowry Nelson served as the first director. Nelson believed that educational opportunity should not be limited to those who could formally attend colleges and universities in the standard campus format. In 1946, Harold Glen Clark was made director of the extension division. Clark oversaw a major expansion of the role of BYU and the expansion or creation of many of the programs that BYU still offers, staying at the head of the program until he became the first president of the Provo Temple.Ernest L. Wilkinson and Leonard J. Arrington, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years Vol. 3, p. 706-708 Bachelor of General Studies The Bachelor of General Studies (BGS) program is an accredited bachelor's degree from BYU, designed to help former students who left the university without completing a degree. The program's motto is \\"Finish at home what you started at BYU.\\" Students may apply previously earned credit towards their final degree. Students who are formally accepted into the program complete a BGS degree, with a major in General Studies, and an emphasis in American Studies, English, Family Life, History, Management or Psychology. Programs or events =Evening classes= Evening classes offered allows students and members of the community to attend BYU classes without formally applying to the university. Classes can be taken to satisfy degree requirements for transfer to another university, or to satisfy educational or career goals. =Education Week= Education Week is a one-week time of lectures in August. Most of the participants are adults, significantly more females than males, who want to augment their personal enrichment or education. However, there are also teenage youth participants with some lectures aimed specifically at teenagers and even dances for the youth. The minimum age for participation is 14. Over 1,000 classes are offered. The program started in 1922, originally as a leadership week.BYU Education Week home page It was originally held during the winter to allow for attendance by farmers. In 1950 it moved to the summer and in 1963 the name was changed to Education Week.Wilkinson and Arrington. Brigham Young University, 713-714 In 2009, attendance was around 20,000.Mormon Times 14 Aug, 2009 Some Education Week lectures are broadcast over the satellite network owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), while others are shown on BYUtv. =Conferences and workshops= BYU's DCE oversees a range of conferences and workshops. Many of these are short summer programs aimed at improving the skills of specific groups such as adults, professionals, and youth. =BYU Women's Conference= BYU Women's Conference is a two-day conference co-sponsored by the university and the LDS Church's Relief Society organization. It is open to women and men, ages 16 and older. Both days of the conference begin and end with a general session in the Marriott Center, where all participants meet together. Between the general sessions there are three one-hour concurrent sessions, with up to 16 sessions to choose from each hour. Topics, centered on the annual theme, include home, family, marriage, service, gospel (scripture, doctrine), and other topics such as missionary work and education‚Äîall discussed from a gospel perspective and directed toward women. =Especially for Youth= Especially for Youth is a program run through BYU's DCE for youth ages 14‚Äì18 with the goal of helping the central mission statement to \\"help them come unto Christ\\". It seeks to emphasize physical, spiritual, intellectual and social growth. Although run through BYU and with large numbers of participants at BYU it also occurs at various locations throughout the United States and abroad. The program is mainly run on university campuses.EFY home page =Dance camps= BYU Dance Camps offers dance instruction in ballet, ballroom, clogging, ethnic, folk, jazz, modern and tap. Faculty from BYU's Dance Department, along with guest instructors, direct and teach the Dance Camps. BYU's Dance Department is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance. =Independent study= The BYU Independent Study program offers over 550 courses. They are grouped under four general course headings: university, high school, middle school, and free. The program is headquartered in the George Q. Morris Center. BYU Independent Study began in 1921. BYU's high school level independent study courses are accredited by both the Northwest Accreditation Commission and the Distance Education and Training Council.BYU Independent Study home page The program has been praised as an option for home schooling parents. In May 2010, the NCAA banned the use of BYU Independent Study high school courses as course credit for students bound for Division I schools. This was done because Michael Oher had several years earlier used BYU Independent Study courses to boost his grades. However it was done without consulting BYU on the matter.ABC 4 May 26, 2010Deseret News, May 25, 2010 After the announcement of disallowance the NCAA said that they wanted courses to have mandated student/teacher interaction and to have a minimum course completion time. BYU's courses generally have maximum completion times but not minimum ones.Jamshid Askar. \\"A Tale of Two Linemen\\" in Deseret News, June 6, 2010 Locations =BYU Conference Center= The BYU Conference Center is located on the northeastern part of campus, and shares a lobby with the Harman Continuing Education Building. The Conference Center is primarily used for university sponsored conferences and events, but is also available for rent by groups outside the university. =BYU Jerusalem Center= The BYU Jerusalem Center is a study abroad center. Students enroll through the BYU campus in Utah, travel to the Holy Land, and live in the center for programs that extend for approximately four months. Students study a core curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the length and breadth of the Holy Land. =BYU Salt Lake Center= The BYU Salt Lake Center is one of two satellite campuses operated by BYU. Beginning in 1952 lectures and classes were periodically offered by BYU faculty in Salt Lake City. In January 1959 the BYU Salt Lake Center was formally organized with Lynn M. Hilton as chairman. It was originally located in the Alfred McCune House, but this proved to be too small for the program. Other courses were offered at the Craft House, Barrett Hall, the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, the Institute of Religion adjacent to the University of Utah, and many other locations. In 1972, the Salt Lake Center was relocated to 401 Twelfth Avenue in the former Veteran's Hospital.Wilkinson and Arrington. Brigham Young University. Vol. 3, p. 719-721 Since 2006, the BYU Salt Lake Center has been located in the former Triad Center. Defunct The Ricks Center was authorized in July 1956. It was created after Ricks College (now BYU-Idaho) went from being a 4-year college back to being a two-year college. It was formed largely to provide continuing education classes to teachers. J. Kenneth Thatcher, who was the superintendent of the Sugar-Salem School District in Idaho, was hired to organize the center. Besides classes on the Ricks College campus the center also offered classes through its sub-office in Idaho Falls, Idaho.Wilkinson and Arringont. Brigham Young University, Vol. 3, p. 716-717 The BYU-Ogden Center was located in the old Institute of Religion building in Ogden, which was vacated when a new building was set up near the new Weber Junior College (now Weber State University) campus in 1957. In establishing the center, Ernest L. Wilkinson, president of BYU, and Joseph Fielding Smith, chairman of the executive committee of the BYU Board of Trustees, sent a letter in which they emphasized that the institution was geared toward adult continuing education programs and not meant at all to compete with Weber Junior College. Mark A. Benson, a son of Ezra Taft Benson, was appointed as the first director of the Ogden Center when it opened in August 1957.Wilkinson and Arrington. Brigham Young University. Vol. 3, p. 717-719. The BYU-California center was started in 1959, with central offices but most courses given in LDS Church buildings scattered throughout southern California. Until 1969 almost all the courses offered were non-credit classes. Starting in 1959 the center offered an Ed.D. program.Wilkinson and Arrington. Brigham Young University.

Hence, rather than attempting to minimize or control for the placebo effect, therapy should be structured so as to maximize it. Patrick Pentony's Models of Influence in PsychotherapyPentony, P.

Cross-cultural psychology Within cross-cultural psychology his writings have dealt mainly with comparing and contrasting the race concept in a variety of cultures, the race-IQ debate, and Brazil. Contrary to the folk view of race as a fixed biological phenomenon, Fish argues that people can change their race simply by traveling from one culture to another. What changes is not what they look like, or their genes, or ancestry, but rather the set of cultural categories (folk taxonomy) each culture uses to classify them. Fish's article Mixed Blood,Fish, J.

Drug policy Fish has contrasted two causal models underlying drug policy. The current view is that drugs cause crime and corruption, and spread disease. As a result, drugs have been made illegal. Drug dealers have armed themselves to combat law enforcement, and an escalating arms race has ensued. Fish has argued that this model is fallacious, and has argued for an alternative model: Drug prohibition causes a black market, and the black market causes crime and corruption, and spreads disease. As a result, drug policy should be aimed at shrinking the black market. To achieve this aim, he has been active in bringing together multidisciplinary, international, and American sub-cultural perspectives on drug policy, and to promoting consideration of a wide range of policy alternatives to the War on Drugs. He has served as Adjunct Coordinator of the Committee on Drugs and the Law of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York; and his broadening the discussion of policy alternatives has influenced debates in legal and policy circles.MacCoun, R.

Weapons can be attached to multiple points on the robot, and each weapon type has different abilities which allows the player to customize their robot as they see fit. Over 20 different weapons can be attached to the robot. Additional attachment slots can be unlocked as players progress. In addition to smaller enemies, the game features five boss battles throughout the campaign. Levels are procedurally generated, meaning that the environment changes somewhat each time the game is played. MicroBot also features a Challenge mode in addition to the main campaign in which players must survive continuous waves of enemies for as long as possible. Local cooperative play for two players is supported. The second player can join or leave the game at any time during gameplay. Development MicroBot was unveiled on October 18, 2010 via a press release. It was developed by Naked Sky Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on December 29, 2010 and on PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network on January 4, 2011. Glazer cited several titles as inspiration for the game; older twin-stick shooters Robotron and Smash TV, 2003's Geometry Wars, the popular dungeon crawler series Diablo and fellow Electronic Arts title Spore were also cited as inspiration for their elements of customization. During its unveiling critics also cited similarities to the films Osmosis Jones and The Incredible Journey. It also was compared to the games R-Type Final, Einh√§nder, and Blasteroids. In response Jason Haber of Electronic Arts stated \\"we hope it invokes a lot of pleasant memories of older games but also creates new ones.\\" In speaking of the game's setting Haber stated \\"We wanted to take gamers to a place they have rarely visited before ‚Äî the world inside the human body. The fluid dynamics of the world and the customization of the MicroBot come together to create a unique take on the arcade shooter genre.\\" Naked Sky Entertainment Chief Technical Officer Joshua Glazer further explained the game's fluid dynamics. \\"[The game] has a really intense fluid simulation. The fluid isn‚Äôt just for graphical effect though- you‚Äôll feel it pushing you around as it spurts and spews all over the place.\\" Reception MicroBot was met with mixed reception from critics, but moderate reception overall. It currently averages a score of 62.27% for the Xbox 360 and 69.00% for the PlayStation 3 at GameRankings, a video game aggregate website. Fellow aggregate website Metacritic reports similar scores; 63/100 for the Xbox 360 and 61/100 for the PlayStation 3. Reviewers were divided in their individual scores on the game. The lowest score came from Edge, who rated MicroBot 4/10. The highest score, a 95/100, came from Phil Owen of GameFront. ARS Technica gave the game a \\"buy\\" rating. Reviewers generally praised the visual and audio design aspects of the game. RunDLC reviewer Chris Buffa praised the visual presentation. \\"The designers did outstanding work bringing the human body to life, with red blood cells, tissue, veins and bone.\\" Chris Waters of GameSpot also praised the games visuals. He called them a \\"vivid imagining of microscopic environments.\\" He noted that the game's setting was convincing due to the visual design and \\"ethereal, atmospheric\\" soundtrack. The reviewer from Edge felt that the game made a strong first impression. They called the introduction sequence and soundtrack \\"high-class presentation\\". Kristan Reed, reviewer for Eurogamer, stated that players will want to convince their friends to try the game \\"thanks to the mere beauty of its organic environments.\\" Dakota Grabowski of GameZone called the game's soundtrack \\"beautifully creepy.\\" Critics were divided on their opinions of MicroBots gameplay mechanics. IGN's Kristine Steimer felt that the levels were sometimes imbalanced, and that boss fights were occasionally \\"a pain in the ass\\". Steimer did note that the inclusion of puzzle elements were \\"refreshing\\". The reviewer from Edge felt that the game's procedurally generated level design did not deliver the desired effect of randomized gameplay. They stated that \\"the absence of a human touch is keenly felt.\\" The reviewer did note the welcome addition of local cooperative multiplayer. Jason Jasicki, reviewer for Machinima.com also appreciated to addition of cooperative gameplay; he further gave high remarks for the game's \\"tight controls and customizability.\\" GameSpot's Chris Watters was more critical of gameplay; he called the action \\"rarely exciting\\" and \\"simplistic\\". Chris Buffa of RunDLC felt that the gameplay did not provide enough new and fresh features to differentiate it from other twin-stick shooters, but praised the addition of cooperative gameplay. He noted that two player cooperative \\"gives you a chance to strategize with a friend.\\" Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus criticized the pace of the levels, but praised the level of customization GameZone's Dakota Grabowski expressed disappointment in the fact online play was omitted, but conceded that local cooperative play that allows the second player to join or leave the game at any time was a welcome addition.

She is supposed to have lived in the 15th century. Argjiro inspired Ismail Kadare in a poem he wrote in the 1960s. According to local Albanian folkloric traditions she lived in the 15th century and jumped off Gjirokast√´r Castle in the southern Albanian city of Gjirokast√´r, along with her child so as to avoid being captured by the Ottomans.\\"Prejardhja e emrit t√´ Gjirokastr√´s ka nj√´ shpjegim mitik dhe dy t√´ tjer√´ me natyr√´ m√´ historike.

Q√´ k√´tu rrodhi edhe emri ‚Äúkalaja e Argjiros√´‚Äù. [The origin of the name of Gjirokastra is a mythical explanation and the other two most historical nature. According to legend, during the final siege of the city by the Ottomans, Princess Argjiro, the sister of the city's ruler jumped from the walls of the castle together with her son not to fall alive into enemy hands. From here came the name \\"Argjiro castle\\".]\\"Mezini, Ledita, and Dorina Pojani (2015). \\"Defence, identity, and urban form: the extreme case of Gjirokastra.\\" Planning Perspectives. 30.(3): 27-28. \\"This identity presents itself even in relatively minor details, such as the legend surrounding the city name origin. To date many local residents claim that ‚ÄòGjirokastra‚Äô derives from the name of Princess Argyro, the sister of the local feudal lord, who, during the final siege of the city by the Turks threw herself and her infant son from the fortress battlements into the rocks so as not to be taken alive by the enemy ‚Äì an unlikely explanation since the first mention of the city‚Äôs name appears in Byzantine records, well before the Ottoman conquest.\\" Gjirokast√´r, located within historical Epirus takes its name from the Greek form Argyrokastro meaning silver castle and legend has it that the city was named for her, but the toponym long predates Princess Argjiro's time. In Greek tradition Princess Argyro or Argyri or Argyrini was a Byzantine princess and the eponymous founder of Gjirokast√´r. She built a castle there in the 15th century. Thus, the town is also known by some local Greeks as Castle of Argyro (). The fact that she was the founder of Gjirokast√´r isn't in agreement with archaeologists today. Nevertheless, the settlement was most probably founded during the Byzantine period (5th-15th century). Greek author Alexandros Georgitsis states in 1885 that there were three sisters of royal blood: Gianno (), Leno (), and Argyro. Each princess became the eponymous founder of a town: Gianno of Gianna, Leno of Tepelen√´ and Argyro of Argyrokastro (modern Gjirokast√´r). Author Kostas Krystallis in his short novel ‚ÄúArgyro the single-breasted‚Äù (), in 1893, describes that the castle of Argyro was besieged and taken by the Turks. However, Argyro‚Äôs son following his mother‚Äôs advice, had already escaped to nearby Sofratik√´ and then secretly moved to Kastaniani. There he was murdered by traitors. Argyro, when hearing the news of his death, was eager to take revenge. She finally managed to regain control of her castle and the surrounding region.

Geminiraptor was a small, ground-dwelling bipedal carnivorous paravian. The type species of Geminiraptor is G. suarezarum. Disovery and naming The holotype and only known specimen of Geminiraptor is CEUM 7319, a maxilla recovered from the Lower Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, in Utah, dating to at least the early Barremian stage (about 130 million years ago). Geminiraptor was named by Phil Senter, James I. Kirkland, John Bird and Jeff A. Bartlett in 2010. The generic name is from the Latin geminae (‚Äútwins,‚Äù in honor of the Suarez sisters) and raptor (\\"seizer\\"). The specific name refers to Drs. Celina and Marina Suarez, the twin geologists who discovered the Suarez site. Description Life restoration Possible size estimated by Holtz 2012 The maxilla is long and low, with the process above the antorbital fenestra being horizontal, similar to other advanced troodontids. However, some features of the maxilla are more similar to the condition in basal troodontids such as Sinovenator. These include the presence of a promaxillary fenestra which is visible in lateral view, a narrow promaxillary strut (the bar of bone between the maxillary and promaxillary fenestrae), and a narrow interfenestral strut (the bar of bone between the maxillary and antorbital fenestrae). Geminiraptor is uniquely characterized by the presence of a large pneumatic chamber which expands the maxilla into a triangular shape in cross section, with the base formed by a bony shelf lingual to the teeth. Nine alveoli are preserved, although since both the anterior and caudal tips of the maxilla are missing, certainly more were present. By comparing Geminiraptor's maxilla to that of other troodontids, it was inferred that at least three more teeth were present in the missing anterior part of the maxilla and at least seven in the missing caudal area, for a total of at least nineteen teeth in the maxilla. The alveoli are characteristically square-shaped and separated by small walls of bone, a feature only known in Sinovenator among other troodontids. The paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz Jr. has estimated its weight around and a possible length of . Supplementary Information 2012 Weight Information Although still a rather small dinosaur, Geminiraptor is larger than most other Early Cretaceous troodontids, with its maxillary proportions more similar to those of Late Cretaceous genera. Classification Comparison of the maxilla of Geminiraptor to those of other paravians Geminiraptor is considered a troodontid, a classification supported due to its large number of small teeth. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by its describers placed it in a clade with derived troodontids due to the oblong shape of its maxillary fenestra. Due to the large amount of missing data for the genus, its position within the family is not completely certain, and Geminiraptor may instead be a close relative of Sinovenator due to each of them having interdental bone walls, unlike all other known troodontids. Below is the proposed placement for Geminiraptor conducted by Senter et al. 2010: Paleoecology Geminiraptor compared to the fauna of the Yellow Cat Member from the Cedar Mountain Formation (Geminiraptor in pale purple, next to Utahraptor) Geminiraptor was the first report of a troodontid in the Early Cretaceous of North America, proving their existence. It lived in the Lower Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation about 130-125 million years ago. The environments were semiarid areas with floodplain prairies, riverine forests, and open woodlands. It has been also interpreted that there was a waterlogged bog-like environment. Paleofauna that lived alongside Geminiraptor in the lower bed, included other Theropods: Falcarius and Yurgovuchia. The sauropod Mierasaurus, the large iguanodontian Iguanacolossus and the turtle Naomichelys. There are also indeterminate Goniopholidids crocodiles and an unnamed velociraptorine known from the Lower Yellow Cat.

He was the ordinary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dar-es-Salaam in German East Africa, and bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Natal and of the Vicariate of Eshowe. Biography Back of prayer card signed by Thomas Spreiter =Childhood, early education= Thomas Spreiter was born to a deeply religious Catholic middle-class family. From an early age, he had shown an interest in missionary work, but during the Kulturkampf no orders could engage in missionary activities. However, Benedictine visionary Andreas Amrhein had just begun his Ottilien Congregation and had opened up an institute in Reichenbach am Regen, not far from Regensburg. Spreiter began his novitiate there on 29 September 1886. The institute was housed in a former Benedictine monastery, and the first years, poverty reigned and the work was hard; additionally, Spreiter had become Amrhein's personal secretary. In 1887, the order transferred its activities to St. Ottilien Archabbey. There, he professed on 2 February 1888, and was ordained on 28 July 1897. =First mission= In 1900, he left for the mission in Zanzibar, where the Benedictines of St. Ottilien Archabbey had been active after 1888. He headed the mission there in 1905, until the Maji Maji Rebellion, during which Bishop Cassian and four other bishops were killed, threatened his mission and his life; they fled, and Spreiter went to Europe to learn of his future as a missionary. =Second mission= Spreiter, on his return to Europe, learned that he was appointed as apostolic vicar on 13 March 1906, succeeding Bishop Spiss. He was ordained in St. Ottilien on 1 May, and returned to Africa in 1906, now overseeing all missionary and educational activities in his vicariate: \\"Every year he undertook a pastoral journey through his mission territory. That meant he was on the road for up to six months and covered a distance of around 1500 kilometers on foot.\\" When World War I broke out, all German missionary activities were forcibly halted, and Spreiter was under house arrest in Dar es Salaam until 1920, when he was made to return to Germany, \\"resigning\\" his post in Zanzibar on 24 November 1920. =Third mission= On 27 August 1921 he was appointed as bishop (1st Apostolic Prefect) to the Apostolic Vicariate of Natal (Zululand). In 1922, with the help of other German missionaries, he founded the Inkamana Abbey, also known as Sacred Heart Abbey, Inkamana. Three years later, on 26 January 1924, he was nominated 1st Apostolic Vicar of the newly promoted Vicariate of Eshowe, which had split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Natal in 1921. He was described as \\"rigid and uncompromising.\\"Sieber (1995) 389. He retired on 14 May 1943, and died in Sacred Heart Abbey, on 27 January 1944, where he is buried.Sieber (1995) 387. Dinosaur bones During Spreiter's tenure in Zanzibar, Werner Janensch and Edwin Hennig were conducting their expedition to the Tendaguru Formation. On May 30, 1910, Spreiter visited their camp, where Hennig met him. Spreiter showed him a bone fragment he had picked up in a village near the Mbalawala Plateau, and another fragment he had found in a village called Makangaga, west of Kilwa Kivinje, which proved that dinosaur bones could be found hundreds of miles from Tendaguru, the initial aim of their expedition.

The PlayStation 3 version, which was supposed to be released the day before, was delayed because of the 2011 PlayStation Network outage then later released in June 2011. A Microsoft Windows version was released on September 29, 2014, followed by the Mac OS X version on December 21 of the same year, and the Linux version on February 25, 2015. The game was removed from sale on Steam and the Humble Store in December 2018.  Gameplay  Outland is a 2D platformer with action game elements. Gameplay mainly revolves around using Light (blue) and Dark (red) energies, which allows the player to pass through their respective barriers, and attack monsters born of the opposite alignment (e.g. use Light to attack Dark monsters). Along the way, players learn special powers from large shrines, from simple melee attacks to the harnessing of Light and Dark energy. Players can also collect hidden objects called \\"Masks of the Gods\\" in order to unlock extras such as concept art or enhanced in-game abilities. Players also have an option to experience the entire storyline online with a friend in co-operative mode. There are also co-op challenges scattered throughout the world that can be unlocked and played when in co-op mode. In addition to the main storyline, there is an Arcade Mode that puts the player to the test by putting a set time for the player to traverse throughout an entire region and defeat its protector. For example, in the Jungle's Arcade Mode, the player has 15 minutes to travel throughout the entire Jungle and defeat the Golem in the end. The highest scores are posted online on a leaderboard. Flipping a switch, pausing the game, and dying halt the timer. Arcade scores increase with multipliers that drop from enemies, and a bonus is given depending on how much time is left after the protector is defeated. An Arcade chapter for one area is unlocked as soon as the area itself is unlocked.  Plot  In the present day, one man had started to experience dreams and visions of the past. He attempted to take medicine to stop it, thinking that this was a medical problem, but the medicine was ineffective; something larger was at play here. The man decided to find a shaman to find out what the problem was, what these dreams and visions meant, and to cure him of them. However, the shaman told the man of the ancient stories of a battle 30,000 years ago between a great hero and the two Sisters of Chaos - one who controls Light from the Sun, and one who controls Darkness from the Moon. The Sisters were imprisoned after the battle, but the hero had perished in the process. The shaman informed the man that he was the hero's reincarnation, and that the Sisters of Chaos have apparently escaped their imprisonment. This man was now the only one who could stop them, and so he went forth on the journey. First, the man runs into the Crossroads of the World, which connects to multiple areas. When he arrives, however, he experiences yet another, and the last, vision of the past in the middle of a large shrine. This is perhaps the most vivid of the visions, because even the player gets a chance to control the hero from 30,000 years ago as he makes his way through the destruction of the world to defeat the Sisters. However, the fight itself is not shown, as the vision is terminated at the very moment the fight began, while the narrator tells the result. Back in the present day, the man makes his way throughout four areas: the Jungle, the Underworld, the , and the Sky. There are four protectors in the world, one per area, but they have been corrupted by Chaos and are now her minions. Due to this, the man must defeat these protectors as well. There are also many different species of creatures throughout the world, born from Light, Dark, or neutral energies, attempting to block the man's path, assisting the protectors and Chaos. After the defeat of one protector, a rune, depicting the defeated protector, is activated in the large shrine in the Crossroads of the World, which triggers a short speech from the narrator about that protector and their corruption, as well as the opening of the next area of the world (in the order of the Jungle, the Underworld, the and then the Sky). When all four protectors are defeated and four of the five runes activated, the shrine teleports the man to the Temple of Eternity. The Temple of Eternity is where the Sisters were imprisoned in the battle 30,000 years ago, waiting all this time for their chance to escape and \\"uncreate\\" the world. The man must travel throughout the Temple of Eternity, finally ending his journey at one section named the Trail of Tears. Just past the Trail of Tears is a giant ladder, identical to the one the ancient hero had used to fight the Sisters. So the man climbs up the ladder and fights the Sisters in one last battle to save the world. After winning the battle, the man is ready to deal the final blow and end the Sisters' lives, when suddenly, the Temple of Eternity collapses. The Sisters have never actually seen the world, only knowing that they wanted to destroy it and make it their own. But now, after they see the beauty and tranquility that both time and mankind had created, the Sisters humbly surrender to the man and retreat back to where they belong; one Sister to the Sun, one to the Moon. The spirit of the ancient hero from all those years ago then escapes from the man's body, as both the spirit's and the man's work are complete.  Reception  The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Tom McShea of GameSpot called the game an \\"expertly crafted platformer.\\" The reviewer praised the game's visual style, music, and co-op. IGN also called it \\"a hell of a game, and you should play it posthaste.\\" The Escapist gave the Xbox 360 version a score of four stars out of five and said that it \\"will put your skills to the test, but strikes a pleasant balance between frustration and triumph. It's not the easiest game in the world, but the effort it takes to master is well worth it.\\" The Daily Telegraph similarly gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"a game which is fun to play simply for the joy of playing, and when you throw in the ability to play through the story with a second person, along with some additional challenge areas designed exclusively for co-op play, Outland is [a] highly appealing, highly enjoyable downloadable title.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B and stated, \\"Boss battles are another highlight, a great example being a robed figure who can unpredictably cause colored rubble to come whizzing by from any direction.\\" Wired gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of eight stars out of ten in its early review and called it \\"a tumultuous blend of Prince of Persia-style jumping action and the \\"bullet hell\\" of insane shooters like Ikaruga. It's complex, difficult and a lot of fun.\\" Outland was awarded as \\"Best PSN Game of 2011\\" by IGN and \\"Best Download-only Console Game 2011\\" by GameSpot.

He served as Governor of Santa Cruz Province (1983‚Äì87), and as the country's Minister of Defense (2010‚Äì13) and Security (2013). Life and times Arturo Antonio Puricelli was born in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. He enrolled at the National University of the Littoral, and became affiliated with the populist Justicialist Party. Earning a Law Degree in 1973, he returned to Santa Cruz, was named Inspector General of the Provincial Justice Ministry, and in 1975, was appointed Minister of Social Policy.Dr. Arturo Antonio Puricelli- Curriculum Vitae He started a private law practice, Puricelli & Associates, after the March 1976 coup, when nearly all elected officials were removed. The dictatorship ultimately called for elections in 1983, and Puricelli secured his party's nomination as a candidate for governor of Santa Cruz. The victorious Puricelli was among the youngest and, with 56% of the vote, the third-most decisively elected governor that year. His rival in the primaries, a young banking attorney, N√©stor Kirchner, was appointed head of the Provincial Social Security Fund by the new governor. Puricelli hoped this might earn his fledgling administration greater backing from Kirchner's supporters, but the move backfired when in April 1984, the latter refused the governor's request for borrowing from the fund to cover the provincial deficit. As governor, Puricelli pursued a greater share of the hundreds of millions of dollars in fossil fuel royalties generated largely by the then- state owned oil concern, YPF, and sued the federal government to that effect. He also strove to diversify his remote province's economy, and established the resort town of El Chalt√©n by way of promoting tourism.La Naci√≥n: Vaivenes de una relaci√≥n dif√≠cil con Kirchner (15 December 2010) Constitutionally barred from seeking re-election upon the end of his term in 1987, Puricelli was elected President of the Santa Cruz chapter of the Justicialist Party. He supported veteran party figure Antonio Cafiero, who had just been elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province, as his party's nominee ahead of the 1989 presidential elections, and obtained the support of numerous Santa Cruz Justicialists, including Kirchner, for Cafiero's Renewal Front ticket. The support of the new governor, Ricardo del Val, for a dark horse candidate, La Rioja Governor Carlos Menem, proved decisive, however, and Menem won 80% of the Santa Cruz vote during the 1988 primary. He became the Justicialist nominee, and was elected president the following year. Puricelli was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies during the same elections. He ran again for governor in 1991, but was defeated in the primaries by Kirchner, who at the time enjoyed President Menem's support. Having refused to campaign for Menem during the general election, Puricelli adopted a more pragmatic stance towards the president during the latter's 1989-99 administration, and in 1996, he was named head of the state postal service, Encotesa; Puricelli served in a caretaker capacity ahead of the postal carrier's 1997 privatization.La Naci√≥n: Menem puso a un hombre suyo en el Correo (8 March 1996) He returned to Santa Cruz and in 1997 was elected to the Provincial Lower House, where despite his differences with Governor Kirchner, he voted in favor of allowing the governor to manage the province's growing oil and gas royalties on an off-budget basis. He later returned to Buenos Aires as Vice-President of the National Airports Regulatory Agency (ORSNA). Puricelli faces the press following his 2010 appointment as Defense Minister. Puricelli joined the center-left Alliance, at the time the main party in opposition. Still at ORSNA when he switched parties in 1999, this gambit resulted in his dismissal, as well as in his being expelled from the Justicialist Party. He ran as a candidate for governor in that year's elections, and was again defeated by Kirchner. Following the collapse of the Alliance government at the end of 2001, however, Puricelli returned to the Justicialist fold as Secretary of Provincial Affairs for President Eduardo Duhalde. This relationship, too, soured when Duhalde announced his endorsement of Governor Kirchner for presidential elections held in 2003, and Puricelli resigned his post. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress, and retired to his ranch in scenic Los Antiguos, where he raised sheep and cultivated cherry orchards. Declaring himself to harbor \\"irreconcilable differences\\" with Kirchner, who became president, Puricelli would become Kirchner's surprise pick to head the state-owned Fabricaciones Militares, the nation's largest defense contractor, in 2006. Following the designation of Defense Minister Nilda Garr√© at the head of the powerful new Ministry of Security, Puricelli was appointed to replace her on December 15, 2010. The president nominated him to the post of Minister of Security on May 30, 2013. Following a cabinet reshuffle in December, Puricelli stepped down; he was succeeded by Emergency Assistance Secretary Mar√≠a Cecilia Rodr√≠guez.

Background German soldiers in Albania. After Italy was defeated by the Allies, Germany occupied Albania in September 1943, dropping paratroopers into Tirana before the Albanian guerrillas could take the capital, and the German army soon drove the guerrillas into the hills and to the south. Berlin subsequently announced it would recognize the independence of a neutral Albania and organized an Albanian government, police, and military. Many Balli Komb√´tar units collaborated with the Germans against the communists, and several Balli Komb√´tar leaders held positions in the German-sponsored regime. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on November 29, 1944. The National Liberation Army, which in October 1944 consisted of 70,000 regulars, also took part in the war alongside the antifascist coalition. The Albanian partisans also liberated Kosovo, and assisted Tito's communist forces in liberating part of Montenegro and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina.Socialist Albania since 1944: domestic and foreign developments, Author Peter R. Prifti Edition illustrated Publisher MIT Press, 1978 , p. 198 By that time, the Soviet Army was also entering neighboring Yugoslavia, and the German Army was evacuating from Greece into Yugoslavia. Commemoration The holiday was first proclaimed in the early 1950s as a day of commemoration. During the era of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Liberation Day was the main state holiday, celebrated with a military parade of the Albanian People's Army on Tirana's D√´shmor√´t e Kombit Boulevard. The parade usually consisted of veterans of the UPS, schoolchildren from the local Tirana school district, Members of the People's Volunteer Guard, the Republican Guard Regiment and UPS personnel from the Directorate of State Security (Sigurimi), marching with musical accompaniment from the Band of the Albanian People's Army. It was held on jubilee years, including on the ruby jubilee in 1984 and the silver jubilee in 1969. A commemorative coin called \\"50 Qindarka\\" was issued by the Bank of Albania in honor of the 25th Anniversary of the Liberation of Albania. Qemal Stafa Stadium was renovated in time for the 30th anniversary in 1974. Liberation Day comes a day after the Albanian Flag Day or Independence Day commemorating the Albanian Declaration of Independence and the rise of the Albanian flag in Vlora on 28 November 1912. As a result, the celebrations are connected. The entire two day period is a non-working day.http://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/liberation-day-albania/ Today, the holiday is celebrated with a national ceremony of some sort including the Albanian Armed Forces. A wreath laying ceremony takes place in the National Martyrs Cemetery of Albania, where 900 war dead are buried.https://sites.psu.edu/adavipassion/2018/11/29/albania-liberation-day/ These events are held in the presence of the President of Albania, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Parliament, the Minister of Defense, the Chief of the Albanian General Staff and MPs of the Kuvendi.http://arkiva.ata.gov.al:8080/70th-anniversary-of-liberation-of- albania-senior-officials-pay-homage-to-martyrs-cemetery/ In 2014, a military parade took place at the Ministry of Defense during the diamond jubilee of the Liberation of Albania, which included an exhibition drill and a mass inspection.http://mbrojtja.gov.al/index.php/newsroom-2/806-kremtohet-70-vjetori- i-clirimit-te-atdheut Controversy There is controversy in Albania in regards to the date: several opinion makers think that the date was chosen by the Communist Party of Albania fictitiously in order to have the same liberation date as Yugoslavia's (the day Peter II of Yugoslavia was deposed as the last King of Yugoslavia). During the celebrations, war veterans often march in processions or sit at ceremonies while either carrying portraits of Enver Hoxha or performing the Hoxhaist Salute. This has become an issue due to the fact that Hoxha's legacy in the country is one of oppression and tactics that are compared to those of Mao Zedong in China or Joseph Stalin in the USSR. In one instance, during the 70th anniversary celebrations, it was reported by the Embassy of the United States, Tirana that Prime Minister Edi Rama ordered that veterans who do such thing be asked to leave.http://top- channel.tv/english/tiranas-70th-anniversary-of-liberation-veterans-show-enver- hoxhas-portraits/ References Sources * Colonel David Smiley.

According to the folklores, the Ao Nagas emerged from ‚Äòsix stones‚Äô. These stones symbolise their forefathers and that location is named as ‚ÄòLongterok‚Äô which means six stones. These stones are still intact at Chungliyimti in Tuensang district. From this village, the Ao tribe moved towards northern region crossing a river named Tz√ºla and settled at Soyim, also known as Ungma today. This was the first Ao Village ever known. After a few centuries, a group of people moved further to the north-east of Soyim and settled at a place named as Mokokchung, or today‚Äôs Mokokchung village. Many other Ao Naga villages came into being when people migrated out from this village including Ungma in the later part.Mokokchung District Gazetters, 1979 pages 1 & 2. Derivation of the Name Mokokchung is the construction of Mokok and Chung, where Mokok means unwillingly and Chung means a group of people. Thus, the name Mokokchung would refer to a group of people who unwillingly departed from their settlement. The founders of Mokokchung village were from Soyim. The Soyim people were requesting these founders not to go away from Soyim and had insisted them to stay together, but they did not listen and went away. Demography Racially the Ao Nagas are Mongolians,Smith, William W. (1925). Ao Naga Tribe of Assam, p. 60. MacMillan. therefore all Mokokchung villagers are Mongolians and is believed to have migrated from the far east 'through' Chungliyimti. There are five clans within the village --- Pongener, Longkumer, Jamir, Atsongchanger and Kechutzar. Marriage within the same clan are prohibited and monogamy is practised. Each clan is treated equally. The village is divided into two khels (or sectors) ‚Äì the upper khel and the lower khel. Although this division is normally based on the Ao dialect(\\"Mongsen\\" and \\"Jungli\\") spoken by the people in other Ao villages, the case is different in Mokokchung Village. Both the khels speak only \\"Mongsen\\" dialect. The average lifespan of Mokokchung villagers is 85‚Äì90 years. As of today (April'2014), the oldest person in the village is a 108-year-old lady named Mrs. Kashila and she still moves without anybody‚Äôs support. Total population as per the (ongoing) census of 2010 is 9450 and there are 1194 buildings with 1470 households in the village. Location Mokokchung village is adjacent to Mokokchung town, at an altitude of about 1350 metres above sea level ‚Äì at the highest point, Mongsen Salang ‚Äì which bears the longitude 94¬∫31.9072 E and latitude 26¬∫19.5864 N. The temperature does not rise beyond 32 ¬∞C, and average summer temperature is 27 ¬∞C. In summer about 2500mm of rainfall is there from June to August. Village Administration system Mokokchung Village is a recognized village under Nagaland State (India). Village administration is under the customary laws, which is approved by Government under the Nagaland Village and Area Councils Act, 1978.Nagaland Act.No.1 of 1979. This village council is called the ‚ÄòPutu Menden‚Äô and its council members are not contested but nominated from each clan for a period of thirty years. The chief of the council is not hereditary but elected by its members. Religion & Modernization The Aos are religious and believe in life here-after. They had principles of worship pattern but not in systematic order, nor in written script. These rites were conducted by two priestly clans, Pongener for the Chungli khel and Atsongchanger for the Mongsen khel. In 1872, these highlanders and former head-hunters were influenced by the Christian missionaries under the American Foreign Baptist Mission. Reverend Edward Winter Clark of Boston, USA was the first white man to arrive into Naga soil, and Christianity was received.Atsongchager, Mar(1995) Christian Education and Social Change, Christian Literature Centre, Guwahati. The first Christian convert from Mokokchung Village was in 1910, and a Church was established. Modern school came along with the Church in 1926Mokokchung Church Platinum Jubilee, Souvenir 1985. after the British colonizers had chosen this town as their administrative unit in 1890. Culture and lifestyle The main annual festivals that were popular in the past are the Moats√º and the Tsungremong. The Moats√º festival is celebrated on 2 May in honour of Lijaba, ‚Äì the creator of the whole earth ‚Äì to appeal for his blessings in the cultivation that immediately follows after the sowing season. The Tsungremong festival ‚Äì a celebration for harvesting ‚Äì is held during the 1st week of August.

Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization, Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009 distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal- rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). Global software development projects, may be neither insourced nor outsourced, in a process that is sometimes termed \\"remote insourcing.\\"BPM Watch: These projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.

Satavados were established in times of political and economical overthrow of Georgian Kingdom, by exploitation peasants and grooving immunity of feudal lords when they formed a new class of Tavadi (count) (). The long period of domination of foreign intruders extremely weakened the central political and economic power, which became the main reason for rising of Satavados. The regions lost economical interrelations. The feudal anarchy grew in the country. Weak monarch could not employ his main function ‚Äì keep his villains in humility and safe feudal order in country. Satavados were created by union of feudal families (union by oath). Big feudal lords, unified in Satavado. captured former King's territories or were granted with the power to manage the territories. (Saeristavo, Satsikhistavo, etc.). They obeyed to Aznauri (nobleman) and created their own government offices independently from the King. (Maidservants, regular army etc.) and confronted with the central government system, Royalty system. When Georgia was united (11th-13th centuries) the country became strong economically and socially, Royal role was mighty and ground for such feudal institutes does not existed. Manorial estates were created through the long period of history. They included granted, awarded, dowry and ravished manors. Part of Satavado was created on the basis of Saeristavo. (Such as Ksani, Aragvi, Racha and others) In Satavado three kind of land hold forms existed: * Common or cooperative () * Prince property () * Individually owned () ‚ÄúCommon‚Äú () - was a manor which was used commonly by the families belonging to the same Satavado. The minor was managed by Tavadi appointed by the heads of other families too. They were paying ‚ÄúState taxes‚Äù and the rest of the income was divided by the families. Tavadi was getting twice as big divvy than other families. ‚ÄúPrince property‚Äù () ‚Äì was granted to a feudal family to manage it for some time. After some period that minor could have been given to another family. Interim owned of the ‚ÄùPrince property‚Äù could not sell or change anything in serf-feudal obligations. (Disembarrass or change gilds). Such kind of changes could have been made only by Prince's agreement. ‚ÄúIndividually owned‚Äù () - manors were most progressive type of land hold. It vas individually owned by only one family, which was inherited or was granted for good service to the King or dowered. Individually owned lands were unconditional properties. Owner could sell, give in dowry or do something else with his property. This kind of ownership supported the development of intensive agriculture. Exploitation of servants was more restrained than in ‚ÄúCommon‚Äú or ‚ÄúPrince property‚Äù manors. Aznauri (Nobleman) were divided according to the type of Satavado they belong. They were: ‚ÄúCommon‚Äú (), ‚ÄúPrince property‚Äù () or ‚ÄúIndividually owned‚Äù () subordinated. They were getting manors with servants from Tavadi. This land hold relations was the bases for feudal-hierarchy. The mane Satavado in Kartli were: Ksani's, Aragvi's, Samukhranbatono, Saamilakhvro, Satsitsiano, Sabaratiano. In Imereti ‚Äì Mkheidzeta, Chkheidzeta, Mikheladzeta, Rachis Eristavta, Abashidzeta, Tseretelta. In Guria ‚Äì Machutadzeta and Guriis eristavta. In Odishi ‚Äì Chiladzeta, Goshadzeta, Djaianta, Chichuata, Chikvnta and others. (Many of them were named after the families which owned them) Satavados system disunited feudal Georgia and made reunion of the country impossible. It facilitated influence of intruders and helped them to keep authority, therefore they supported Satavados. The Satavados were abolished in the 19th century when Georgia was fully occupied by the Russian Empire. There were no more social-economical reasons for their existence. Satavados were divided among different private minors.

Draining ‚Äì almost all of it wilderness ‚Äì the Middle Fork is one of the largest wholly undeveloped watersheds in the state, with no dams or paved roads within its basin. The entire length of the Middle Fork is designated a National Wild and Scenic River. Course The Middle Fork originates at Helen Lake in the high Sierra, near Muir Pass in Kings Canyon National Park. From its headwaters at above sea level, it descends rapidly east down Le Conte Canyon, turning south at Big Pete Meadow. It passes the Le Conte Ranger Station and receives Dusy Creek from the east and then the much larger Palisade Creek, also from the east, a short distance downstream. Flowing south, it enters a narrower canyon where it drops over a waterfall known as Devil's Washbowl. It receives Cartridge Creek from the east, then turns southwest through Simpson Meadow, a broad subalpine valley at about elevation, where it receives Goddard Creek from the north. Below Simpson Meadow the Middle Fork turns west-southwest, flowing along the bottom of the Slide Bluffs and receiving many small tributaries before reaching the dramatic glacial canyon of Tehipite Valley, one of the most isolated parts of the park. Tehipite Dome, rising above the river, is the largest granite dome in the Sierra. Many rattlesnakes inhabit the canyon, especially from Simpson Meadow down to the junction with the South Fork. Blue Canyon Creek and Crown Creek tumble down the north wall of the valley, forming waterfalls before they merge with the Middle Fork. Downstream, the Middle Fork flows through Little Tehipite Valley and then enters a rugged, trailless deep canyon in the Monarch Wilderness just outside the western boundary of the park. It joins with the South Fork Kings River to form the main stem of the Kings River, about upstream of Pine Flat Lake.

The river forms part of Kings Canyon, the namesake of Kings Canyon National Park and one of the deepest canyons in North America with a maximum relief of from rim to river. Course The South Fork is the largest headwater of the Kings River. It originates at an elevation of at an unnamed lake in Kings Canyon National Park, south of Mather Pass and west of Split Mountain, in a high alpine basin known as Upper Basin. It flows south, and is paralleled for several miles by the combined Pacific Crest Trail/John Muir Trail. The trail and river separate at a point west of Taboose Pass, where the river turns to the southwest through a deep gorge between Cirque Crest to the northwest and Arrow Ridge to the southeast. To the east, the Muro Blanco cliffs rise more than half a mile (0.8 km) above the river. The river flows into Paradise Valley, where it flows in a south-southwest direction, and receives Woods Creek from the east directly below a footbridge that carries the Woods Creek Trail over the river. Until this point the river has been more or less continuous whitewater; in Paradise Valley the gradient lessens and the current slows. Below Paradise Valley the river once again flows through a narrow gorge where it drops over Mist Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in the park. South Fork Kings River in the Kings Canyon It then enters Kings Canyon, a glacial valley with a flat meadow floor surrounded by granite cliffs, which has been compared by John Muir and others to Yosemite Valley in terms of appearance and geology. It receives Bubbs Creek, and turns due west, flowing gently through grassy flats including Zumwalt Meadow, occasionally forming rapids where it breaches ancient glacial moraines. It receives its largest tributary, Roaring River, from the south and passes through Cedar Grove, home to many campgrounds and visitor facilities. Further west the river reaches the deepest part of Kings Canyon, where Highway 180 follows the river closely for several miles, and Boulder Creek enters from the south. Boyden Cavern lies adjacent to the river just above Horseshoe Bend, the steepest and narrowest part of the canyon. The river joins with the Middle Fork Kings River in the Monarch Wilderness, just outside Kings Canyon National Park, to form the main stem of the Kings River.

Fisher, Fish Bulletin 179, 2001 http://www.dfg.ca.gov/fish/REsources/Reports/Bulletin179_V1.asp Woodhull and Dill (1942) noted that salmon ascend about 10 to 12 mi beyond the present upper extent of the reservoir and salmon migration in the Kings River probably ascended no farther than the confluence of the North Fork. Yoshiyama and Moyle also noted that there is an undocumented note of \\"a few salmon\\" having occurred much farther upstream at Cedar Grove (28 mi above present-day Pine Flat Reservoir) in the past. According to the California Department of Fish and Game, \\"many of the waters in the headwaters of the South Fork Kings River and several tributary streams and lakes were also planted with California golden trout from GTC (Golden Trout Creek) between 1909 and 1914.\\"Stephens, McGuire, and Sims (Sept. 17, 2004) \\"Conservation Assessment and Strategy for the California Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita) Tulare County, California, p.3 the California Department of Fish and Game fish data base from their surveys indicate that only rainbow trout, brown trout and Sacramento sucker are found in the South Fork Kings River.Stephanie Mehalick, CDF&G; The Park Service used to stock rainbow trout in the river, but terminated the practice in the 1980s in favor of letting the fishery return to more natural conditions.

The rules of etiquette that apply when communicating over the Internet are different from those applied when communicating in person or by audio (such as telephone) or videophone. It is a social code that is used in all places where one can interact with other human beings via the Internet, including text messaging, email, online games, Internet forums, chat rooms, and many more. It can be a challenge to communicate on the Internet without misunderstandings mainly because input from facial expressions and body language is absent in cyberspace. Therefore, several rules, in an attempt to safeguard against these misunderstandings and to discourage unfriendly behavior, are regularly put in place at many websites, and often enforced by moderation by the website's users or administrators. Netiquette Netiquette, a colloquial portmanteau of network etiquette or Internet etiquette, is a set of social conventions that facilitate interaction over networks, ranging from Usenet and mailing lists to blogs and forums. Like the network itself, these developing norms remain in a state of flux and vary from community to community. The points most strongly emphasized about Usenet netiquette often include using simple electronic signatures, and avoiding multiposting, cross-posting, off-topic posting, hijacking a discussion thread, and other techniques used to minimize the effort required to read a post or a thread. Similarly, some Usenet guidelines call for use of unabbreviated English while users of instant messaging protocols like SMS occasionally encourage just the opposite, bolstering use of SMS language. However, many online communities frown upon this practice, as it is usually not necessary in online situations. Common rules for e-mailThe Complete Idiot's Guide to... Writing Well By Laurie Rozakis, https://books.google.com/books?id=YFIEfqL48AMC&pg;=PA348&dq;=netiquette&ie;=ISO-8859-1&sig;=t9ZuKcbWOymIy9oNrRAy9ZfAikI#PPA348,M1 and Usenet such as avoiding flamewars and spam are constant across most mediums and communities. Another rule is to avoid typing in all caps or grossly enlarging script for emphasis, which is considered to be the equivalent of shouting or yelling. Other commonly shared points, such as remembering that one's posts are (or can easily be made) public, are generally intuitively understood by publishers of Web pages and posters to Usenet, although this rule is somewhat flexible depending on the environment. On more private protocols, however, such as e-mail and SMS, some users take the privacy of their posts for granted. One-on-one communications, such as private messages on chat forums and direct SMS, may be considered more private than other such protocols, but infamous breaches surround even these relatively private media. For example, Paris Hilton's Sidekick PDA was cracked in 2005, resulting in the publication of her private photos, SMS history, address book, etc. A group e-mail sent by Cerner CEO Neal Patterson to managers of a facility in Kansas City concerning \\"Cerner's declining work ethic\\" read, in part, \\"The parking lot is sparsely used at 8 A.M.; likewise at 5 P.M. As managers‚Äîyou either do not know what your EMPLOYEES are doing, or YOU do not CARE ... In either case, you have a problem and you will fix it or I will replace you.\\" After the e-mail was forwarded to hundreds of other employees, it quickly leaked to the public. On the day that the e-mail was posted to Yahoo!, Cerner's stock price fell by over 22% from a high market capitalization of US$1.5 billion.E-Mail Rules: A Business Guide to Managing Policies, Security, and Legal Issues for E-Mail and Digital Communications By Randolph Kahn & Nancy Flynn https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9CbhiflZh0C&pg;=PA45&dq;=netiquette&ie;=ISO-8859-1&sig;=5jsrxx0u3qWX1_d4KXCl-_4Tc_4#PPA47,M1 Beyond matters of basic courtesy and privacy, e-mail syntax (defined by RFC 2822) allows for different types of recipients. The primary recipient, defined by the To: line, can reasonably be expected to respond, but recipients of carbon copies cannot be, although they still might.https://archive.is/20120701160707/http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-1043085.html Electronic office etiquette Likewise, misuse of the CC: functions in lieu of traditional mailing lists can result in serious technical issues. In late 2007, employees of the United States Department of Homeland Security used large CC: lists in place of a mailing list to broadcast messages to several hundred users. Misuse of the \\"reply to all\\" caused the number of responses to that message to quickly expand to some two million messages, bringing down their mail server. In cases like this, rules of netiquette have more to do with efficient sharing of resources‚Äîensuring that the associated technology continues to function‚Äîrather than more basic etiquette. On Usenet, cross- posting, in which a single copy of a message is posted to multiple groups is intended to prevent this from happening, but many newsgroups frown on the practice, as it means users must sometimes read many copies of a message in multiple groups. When referring to a previous discussion or expertise, quote a few lines instead of entire paragraphs. Select quotes provides enough description without bogging down a discussion and detracting from our own points. Be brief, and don't write out dissertations for simple questions; if you post long to reply to simple questions for advice, many will be unlikely to read it. Due to the large variation between what is considered acceptable behavior in various professional environments and between professional and social networks, codified internal manuals of style can help clarify acceptable limits and boundaries for user behavior. For instance, failure to publish such a guide for e-mail style was cited among the reasons for an NZ$17,000 wrongful dismissal finding against a firm that fired a woman for misuse of all caps in company-wide e-mail traffic.Moore, Matthew. \\"Office worker sacked for writing emails in block capitals\\". Daily Telegraph, Sep 1, 2009. Accessed May 20, 2010. Digital citizenship Digital citizenship is how a person should act while using digital technology online and has also been defined as \\"the ability to participate in society online\\". The term is often mentioned in relation to Internet safety and netiquette. The term has been used as early as 1998 and has gone through several changes in description as newer technological advances have changed the method and frequency of how people interact with one another online. Classes on digital citizenship have been taught in some public education systems and some argue that the term can be \\"measured in terms of economic and political activities online\\". Netiquette in South Korea In South Korea, the Korea Internet Safety Commission declared the 'Netizen Ethics Code' on June 15, 2000, and the Ministry of Education prepared the 'Information Communication Ethics Education Guidelines' in early 2001. Therefore, some middle and high schools started to provide education on netiquette. The basic netiquette education contents of South Korea are as follows. The writing on a noticeboard should be written clearly and concisely, used by grammar and Korean spelling, and avoid excessive refutation of other people's writings. An e-mail should identify itself and send a letter. When chatting, you should introduce yourself first, engage in conversation, use the title \\"Nim,\\" and slander, abuse, or sarcastic remarks should be prudent. Furthermore, it is against etiquette to repeat the same words at once, and you must greeting when you come out of a chat. Besides, sexual harassment, stalking, and the use of expletive should not be allowed. Cell phone etiquette A headrest cover in the \\"quiet carriage\\" of a British intercity train, reminding passengers that mobile phones must not be used in this carriage The issue of mobile communication and etiquette has also become an issue of academic interest. The rapid adoption of the device has resulted in the intrusion of telephony into situations where it was previously not used. This has exposed the implicit rules of courtesy and opened them to reevaluation.Ling, Richard, \\"One Can Talk About Common Manners\\", 2007. Cell phone etiquette in the education system Most schools in the United States, Europe and Canada have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, citing class disruptions and the potential for cheating via text messaging. In the UK, possession of a mobile phone in an examination can result in immediate disqualification from that subject or from all that student's subjects. This still applies even if the mobile phone was not turned on at the time. In New York City, students are banned from taking cell phones to school. This has been a debate for several years, but finally passed legislature in 2008., Medina, Jennifer \\"Most schools allow students to have cell phones for safety purposes\\"‚Äîa reaction to the Littleton, Colorado, high school shooting incident of 1999 (Lipscomb 2007: 50). Apart from emergency situations, most schools don't officially allow students to use cell phones during class time. =Cell phone etiquette in the public sphere= Talking or texting on a cell phone in public may seem a distraction for many individuals. When in public there are two times when one uses a phone. The first is when the user is alone and the other is when the user is in a group. The main issue for most people is when they are in a group, and the cell phone becomes a distraction or a barrier for successful socialization among family and friends. In the past few years, society has become less tolerant of cell phone use in public areas; for example, public transportation, restaurants and much more. This is exemplified by the widespread recognition of campaigns such as Stop Phubbing, which prompted discussion as to how mobile phones should be used in the presence of others. \\"Some have suggested that mobile phones 'affect every aspect of our personal and professional lives either directly or indirectly'\\" (Humphrey). Every culture's tolerance of cell phone usage varies; for instance in Western society cell phones are permissible during free time at schools, whereas in the Eastern countries, cell phones are strictly prohibited on school property. Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy, such as phones ringing during funerals or weddings, in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some book shops, libraries, bathrooms, cinemas, doctors' offices and places of worship prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install signal-jamming equipment to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal. Some new auditoriums have installed wire mesh in the walls to make a Faraday cage, which prevents signal penetration without violating signal jamming laws. A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transit‚Äîwhat to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters. campaign to promote cell phone manners (in finish) Trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a \\"quiet carriage\\" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past. In the UK however many users tend to ignore this as it is rarely enforced, especially if the other carriages are crowded and they have no choice but to go in the \\"quiet carriage\\". In Japan, it is generally considered impolite to talk using a phone on any train; e-mailing is generally the mode of mobile communication. Mobile phone usage on local public transport is also increasingly seen as a nuisance; the Austrian city of Graz, for instance, has mandated a total ban of mobile phones on its tram and bus network in 2008 (though texting and emailing is still allowed). Nancy J. Friedman has spoken widely about landline and cell phone etiquette. Cell phone etiquette within social relationships When critically assessing the family structure, it is important to examine the parent/child negotiations which occur in the household, in relation to the increased use of cell phones. Teenagers use their cell phones as a way to negotiate spatial boundaries with their parents (Williams 2005:316). This includes extending curfews in the public space and allowing more freedom for the teenagers when they are outside of the home (Williams 2005:318). More importantly, cell phone etiquette relates to kinship groups and the family as an institution. This is because cell phones act as a threat due to the rapid disconnect within families. Children are often so closely affiliated with their technological gadgets, and they tend to interact with their friends constantly and this has a negative impact on their relationship with their parents (Williams 2005:326). Teenagers see themselves as gaining a sense of empowerment from the mobile phone. Cell phone etiquette in the household from an anthropological perspective has shown an evolution in the institution of family. The mobile phone has now been integrated into family practices and perpetuated a wider concern which is the fracture between parent and child relationships. We are able to see the traditional values disappearing; however, reflexive monitoring is occurring (Williams 2005:320). Through this, parents are becoming friendlier with their children and critics emphasize that this change is problematic because children should be subjected to social control. One way of social control is limiting the time spent interacting with friends, which is difficult to do in today's society because of the rapid use of cell phones. Netiquette vs. cell phone etiquette Cell phone etiquette is largely dependent on the cultural context and what is deemed to be socially acceptable. For instance, in certain cultures using your handheld devices while interacting in a group environment is considered bad manners, whereas, in other cultures around the world it may be viewed differently. In addition, cell phone etiquette also encompasses the various types of activities which are occurring and the nature of the messages which are being sent. More importantly, messages of an inappropriate nature can be sent to an individual and this could potentially orchestrate problems such as verbal/cyber abuse. =New technology and behaviors= Perhaps the biggest obstacle to communication in online settings is the lack of emotional cues. Facial cues dictate the mood and corresponding diction of two people in a conversation. During phone conversations, tone of voice communicates the emotions of the person on the other line. But with chat rooms, instant messaging apps and texting, any signals that would indicate the tone of a person's words or their state of emotion are absent. Because of this, there have been some interesting accommodations. Perhaps the two most prevalent compensating behaviors are the use of emoticons and abbreviations. Emoticons use punctuation marks to illustrate common symbols that pertain to facial cues. For example, one would combine a colon and parenthesis to recreate the symbol of the smiley face indicating the happiness or satisfaction of the other person. To symbolize laughter, the abbreviation \\"LOL\\" standing for \\"laughing out loud\\" developed. Along with these, countless other symbols and abbreviations have developed including, \\"BRB\\" (\\"be right back\\"), \\"TTYL\\" (talk to you later) and specific designs incorporated by apps of a laughing face, sad face, crying face, angry face etc. Now, as newer modes of communication are becoming more common, the rules of communication must adapt as fast as the technology. For example, one of the most popular new apps, Snapchat, is growing to have its own rules and etiquette. This app lets a user send pictures or videos that disappear after a couple seconds. Initially, the thought that occurs to people when confronted by this app is its implications for sexting. Although it is entirely possible to make use of Snapchat for that purpose, what the app has developed into is a form of communication that shares funny or interesting moments. Originally compared to InstagramGross, Doug. \\"Snapchat: Sexting Tool, or the next Instagram?\\" CNN. Cable News Network, 10 January 2013. Web. 1 May 2014. by way of the app's ability to broadcast pictures to many people, it has now become standard to communicate through Snapchat by sending pictures back and forth and using the caption bar for messages. The reply option on Snapchat specifically promotes this behavior, but Snapchat etiquette is not set in stone. It is becoming clear that Snaps personalized for the receiver expect a reply, but where ends this obligation? Some people use Snapchat specifically for the purpose of communication, while some use it to simply provide a visual update of their day. The newest update of Snapchat, an instant messaging add-on, seems to be catered to those who use the app to send messages back and forth. This new messaging add-on, along with the video chat feature will warrant new forms of social construct and expectations of behavior in accordance with this application.

This is in contrast to the vast majority of people, who will receive a \\"kingdom of glory\\" after the Final Judgment, and enter into one of three degrees of glory after the resurrection: celestial, terrestrial, or telestial kingdoms. Most Latter-day Saints believe that the sons of perdition will be cast into outer darkness; Mormon scriptures do not use this exact phrase in connection with the sons of perdition, but state that they \\"shall go away into the lake of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels.\\"Doctrine and Covenants In this context, the name \\"Perdition\\" is sometimes regarded as a proper name that refers to either LuciferDoctrine and Covenants or Cain,Book of Moses 5:24 both of whom are symbols of ultimate evil. The most comprehensive exposition of the phrase is found in Section 76 in the Doctrine and Covenants.Doctrine and Covenants . Two classes of sons of perdition According to LDS Church theology, there are two classes of persons who will become sons of perdition: *The pre-mortal spirit followers of Satan. It is taught that, in the pre-mortal life, they chose to follow a plan proposed by Satan, rather than that presented by God the Father (Heavenly Father).Plan of Salvation Jesus the Christ chose to follow Heavenly Father's plan (which included moral agency), volunteered to atone for the sins of all as a part of this plan/become the Savior of all, and the glory would go to the Father. Satan rejected Heavenly Father's plan and proposed his own, wanting to force all to choose the right, return to the Father, and the glory would all be Satan's. Thus ensued the War in Heaven, which resulted in Satan and his followers being cast out of heaven and denied the opportunity of receiving a physical body due to rebellion against God the Father. *Those in mortal life who \\"deny the Holy Ghost,\\" which is generally interpreted as rejecting and denying Christ after receiving a personal witness and a \\"perfect knowledge\\" of Jesus. Joseph Smith taught: In the Doctrine and Covenants, sons of perdition are described as inhabiting \\"a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory.\\"Doctrine and Covenants . However, it is commonly believed that since most persons lack a \\"perfect knowledge\\" of Jesus, they cannot commit the eternal sin, and are therefore incapable of becoming sons of perdition.Church apostle Spencer W. Kimball, stated that \\"the sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly impossible for the rank and file [of the church] to commit such a sin\\": Edward L. Kimball (ed.), Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball (Bookcraft, Salt Lake City, 1982) p. 23; Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness (Bookcraft, Salt Lake City, 1969) p. 123. Daughters of perdition A few LDS Church leaders have speculated whether or not there would be daughters of perdition, as well as sons of perdition. In 1860, church president Brigham Young stated, \\"I doubt whether it can be found, from the revelations that are given and the facts as they exist, that there is a female in all the regions of hell.\\"Journal of Discourses 8:222. The next year he was even more emphatic: \\"Woman must atone for sins committed by the volition of her own choice, but she will never become an angel to the devil, and sin so far as to place herself beyond the reach of mercy.\\"Discourse delivered October 8, 1861, pp. 6‚Äì7, LDS Church Archives. In the same discourse Young explained his reasoning: \\"She is not accountable for the sins that are in the world. God requires obedience from man, he is lord of creation, and at his hands the sins of the world will be required.\\" In 1903, another church president, Joseph F. Smith, affirmed \\"that there would be no daughters of perdition.\\"Stan Larsen, ed., A Ministry of Meetings: The Diaries of Rudger Clawson, (Salt Lake City, Utah: Smith Associates and Signature Books, 1993) p. 560. Such views are not universal among Mormons. After an 1893 meeting of church president Wilford Woodruff and a group of church apostles, they declared, \\"That there will also be daughters of Perdition there is no doubt in the minds of the brethren\\".D.

Demographics Virtually the entire population of Giwan is Filipino. Most, if not all, of the population of the village is Catholic, although no church exists there. Electrical service is available and most residences and other buildings have electricity, although virtually none have air conditioning. There is no telephone, television or internet service, but many residents use mobile phones, as cell service is available from Dapa township. All houses in Giwan appear rudimentary with few or no amenities. The residential part of the village, where about 90% of the population lives, is two blocks wide and two blocks long. A few houses border the beach area and a few are scattered along the highway running through town or north of the highway. Economy Giwan does not have any large shops, but has a number of sari sari stores scattered through the village. The highway has a shelterhouse for persons waiting to ride tricycles traveling from Dapa or Union. The entire west side of Giwan is occupied by a petroleum storage site run by Petron Corporation. Petron is one of the largest companies operating gasoline service stations in the Philippines. The site currently has three large storage tanks. Some small fishing boats are kept by residents at the beach on Giwan's south side. Transport Giwan is along the highway that travels just off the coast from Dapa to Union. The main street, which is the highway, is paved. All the other roads are dirt or sand, although all roads in Giwan are reasonably well maintained. Giwan can be reached by using a motorized tricycle (see motorized tricycle (Philippines)), or by walking. The highway is the only road accessing Giwan.

History Promotional map of Environa. The land itself was originally a subdivision of the grazing property known as Hill Station. It lies just east of the Queanbeyan-Cooma railway line as it goes past the industrial estate of Hume, ACT. Henry Ferdinand Halloran, an enterprising realtor bought the property at auction in 1924 and began planning the future city. Halloran emphasised the future promise of the region, with the closest freehold (Torrens title) land to the federal territory. Plans for the northern part of the subdivision, called Canberra Freehold Estate, included space for offices, shops, a hospital, and theatres. Some of the street names were Rue de Paris, Piazza di Roma and Tokio Dori. On the southern part of the estate, Halloran built stone monuments. These included an arch at the entrance, rows of stone pillars along the entrance route, and a statue of Henry Parkes on a tall column. Bandstands were built, which had corrugated iron roof supported by tree trunks, and a platform. The main top-mast off HMAS Sydney was erected, but rotted at the base and collapsed. This was later moved to Jervis Bay. No blocks were ever sold and the planned development never went ahead with the Great Depression killing off the project. The Queanbeyan Council resumed the land to the north, because of unpaid rates, and it later became part of South Queanbeyan. Henry Halloran died in 1953 after 84 years of life and the property at Environa was inherited by his daughter Mrs Joyce Larcombe. A house was built there in 1971. The proposed street layout of Environa has been marked on Google Maps and Apple Maps. It is still visible at a high level of zoom. Geography Environa lies on the lower slopes of the Pemberton Hill to the south. It is to above sea level. The rocks are acid volcanics, rhyodacite and rhyolite from the Deakin Volcanics.

It is currently located at the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. Background This portrait uses oil paint on panel and portrays Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici. It was painted for his father, Cosimo I de‚Äô Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Bronzino was the official painter of the Medici Court from 1532 and did many portraits of Duke Cosimo I and his family. Cosimo had his portrait done by Bronzino around 1545, the Portrait of Cosimo I de‚Äô Medici. Giovanni and his mother Eleonora of Toledo were the subjects of another portrait by Bronzino from around 1545 or 1546, the Portrait of Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son. Description and Analysis An extended title for this portrait is the Portrait of Giovanni de‚Äô Medici as a Child holding a Goldfinch. It was painted sometime between 1544 and 1545, based on the child's age. Giovanni was born in the September 1543 and this portrait depicts him at the age of eighteen months.Brock, Maurice, and Agnolo Bronzino. Bronzino. Paris: Flammarion, 2002. Print. He is wearing a pink doublet, which is painted with high detail. He holds a goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in his hand, which is a Christian symbol, because the goldfinch eats thistle seed and so is associated with Christ‚Äôs Crown of Thorns and the Passion. It appears in religious paintings to represent the knowledge of the future Crucifixion. Around his neck, he wears a gold chain with a coral and other charms. It was believed that coral could protect children from harm. Unlike Bronzino's other portraits that depict the sitters viewing the world with a distant, aristocratic disdain, Giovanni's portrait is animated and engaging.Negrini, Sergio. The Uffizi of Florence and Its Paintings. New York: Arco Pub. Co, 1974. Print. The portraits of Cosimo's other children are represented with the same emotionless faces as the adults. They do not show any of the children's personality and are very serious. Most of the portraits have the sitter with the body almost face-on, with a slight three-quarter turn of the head to the left. The sitter looks at the viewer and the dark backgrounds are unspecific. Giovanni's portrait is quite different. It depicts an almost 2-year-old child cheerfully and realistically, with an accurate description of the morphology of a young child. Unlike the portraits of the duke's other sons, it is cropped above the knee and the body is presented almost frontally with a slight turn to our left. The child is seated on dark- brown bench, with a dark green background that contrasts well with his pink clothes that are the same color as his coral charm.McCorquodale, Charles. Bronzino. New York: Harper & Row, 1981. Print. It is a natural depiction of early childhood with his chubby face and fingers. Two of his baby teeth are peeping out, and he has tufts of fine hair that all add to his delightful representation. His active expression is that of a young child as he smiles and gazes out at the viewer. Giovanni was the fourth and youngest child of Cosimo, and was portrayed differently from his brothers because his father had different goals for his life. Years later, after Giovanni became a cardinal at the age of seventeen, he had Bronzino paint an allegorical portrait titled Portrait of Giovanni de‚Äô Medici as St. John the Baptist, which was painted between 1560 and 1562. It was said a month after he was born, he was ‚Äúbeautiful and plump‚Äù (bello e grasso) and ‚Äúlike an angel from paradise‚Äù. In 1547, he was described as ‚Äúthe handsomest and happiest boy that ever was‚Ä¶‚Äù which certainly fits the portrayal of his character in this charming portrait.

The regiment's capital was the city of Chyhyryn, now in the Cherkasy Oblast of central Ukraine. The military units of the regiment were also known as the Hetman's Guard serving as personal guards of the Hetman of Ukraine in 1648‚Äì1676. History The regiment was created as a result of the Treaty of Kurukove, between the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which led the establishment of six regiments of Registered cossacks that existed before the Khmelnytsky Uprising. The regiment occupied territory on both sides of the Dnieper River having eleven companies on the Right-bank Ukraine and eight on the Left-bank Ukraine. In the east it bordered the Korsun regiment, on the north of the right-bank the Cherkasy regiment, and on the north side of the left-bank the Kropyvna regiment. When the Khmelnytsky uprising occurred the regiment became part of the Cossack Hetmanate, where the city of Chyhyryn served as the first capital of the Hetmanate and the official residence of the hetman. Following the signing of the Treaty of Zboriv in 1649, it consisted of a total of 19 sotnias and had 3,222 registered Cossacks. When a civil war emerged among the cossacks, the Hetmanate was split along the Dnieper River into Left-Bank Ukraine and Right- Bank Ukraine, which placed the regiment under the control of Right-bank Ukraine hetmans. After the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667, the Right-bank Ukraine and its regiments came under the administration of Poland; while the left-bank companies of the Chyhyryn regiment were transferred to the Myrhorod regiment. During the hetmancy of Petro Doroshenko the southern portion of the Right-bank Ukraine became a Turkish protectorate under the administration of Doroshenko with Chyhyryn as its capital. Following the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz, Polish authority was reinstated on the territory in 1699. The regiment came under the jurisdiction of Ivan Mazepa in 1704, who reunited both banks under his rule during the Great Northern War, but was dissolved in 1712 when the territory was returned to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its population was transferred to Left-bank Ukraine.

Halidzor Fortress is above sea level.Halidzor Fortress Elevation and Location  History  Halidzor was originally built in the 17th century to serve as a nunnery. It later served as a fortress for the Melik Parsadanian family for a short time. During the 18th century, the famous Armenian military commander and liberator David Bek and his chief lieutenant and successor Mkhitar Sparapet used the site as their main headquarters as well as an administrative center for Syunik in their fight against the forces of the Ottoman Empire and the Persians.Revue des √©tudes arm√©niennes: Volume 9 by Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian, Soci√©t√© des √©tudes armeniennes - , pg.305 Between 1723 and 1727, Bek along with 300 other soldiers, 13 bishops, and three priests defended the fortress in a seven-day siege from an invading army of 70,000 Ottoman Turks. The defensive nature of the location gave Bek's soldiers an advantage when fighting the enemy, but the siege left the defenders of the fortress weary with little food. Feeling that they were trapped and outnumbered he led a suicidal charge down the hill that terrified the invading army. The Turks hastily fled the area purportedly leaving 12,000 enemy soldiers dead on the field below. David Bek later died at the fortress after coming down with an illness in 1728. Oral tradition tells that after his death, an elderly bishop from Tatev came and held a very large funeral service in his honor. Bek is reputedly buried in the cemetery just outside the fortress walls. The tombstone is said to have a single flower carved on its underside so that the enemy would not recognize that it is the leader's final resting place. After David Bek's death, the Ottoman army captured Halidzor and notified the defenders that they would take control of the fortress but leave the battalion and residents unharmed. The priest (Der Avedis) wanted solely to negotiate with the Turks, but Mkhitar Sparapet who was now in command of the fortress and the priest together went to negotiate. When they opened doors to the fortress, some of the defenders were slain.  Architecture  The walls of the fortress are laid out in an irregular quadrangle site plan. Within the walls of the fortress are the remains of the church of S. Minas and a chapel as well as the foundations of what had once served as dwellings and other structures. Two arched portals lead into Halidzor from the exterior fortification walls to the north and the south. At the southwestern corner of the fortified wall is a tower and from the north to the east there is a terrace. A secret tunnel once ran to the Voghji River to allow its inhabitants access to fresh water in the event of a siege (one of the reasons Bek's men were able to stand their ground rather than surrender during the siege by the Turks). It is now covered, and sections of the tunnel are in ruin. The church at the eastern side of Halidzor is a vaulted hall-type structure constructed from large stones in the form of rubble masonry. At either side and adjacent to the apse are sacristies. At the north and south walls of the building are the remains of two-storied porticos. The main church of S. Minas is built in a similar architectural technique as the construction of the other church. The eastern yard of the church has been widened. In 2006 restoration and reconstruction work began at Halidzor and ended as of 2010.

He gets promoted to head cashier and as per the rules, gets one key for the bank vault with the other key present with the bank manager (Tanikella Bharani). He celebrates it by buying a television set (the first in the colony!) but due to the treacherous and cunning plan by Bharani along with another bank employee as his aid, Balaji is found accountable to a 1 lakh loss to the bank. He gets suspended from the bank on the day of the promotion itself but to his surprise, he doesn't get recruited into any other job from the next day as he has a negative record. Jhansi convinces Balaji that she'd use her B.Com qualification to get work in Annapurna Foods company, whose Managing Director is her friend from the 12th grade. She goes to meet Gopal Krishna (A.V.S), her friend in the office. After using her wit/charm/brains in tackling a business issue in the board meeting at which she is coincidentally present, Jhansi gets the job as vice president for a Sales division, with a pay of 10 thousand a month. She tells her husband that she secured a job with 3 thousand monthly pay. Meanwhile, Balaji challenges Jhansi that he can take care of the house as he considers it a very easy job and he struggles at home. He cannot make his kids get ready for school, cannot cook at home and cannot manage even simple chores. He hates Jhansi working in the office while he sits at home, but his hands are tied. A few fights ensure between the couple over the same issues and finally, after Krishnashtami celebration events at Gopal's house, Balaji loses his rag. He accuses Jhansi that she wanted her husband to feel bad about himself which is why she took him to Gopal's house to show him how wealthy and happy Gopal is. Jhansi gets a 20 grand bonus in office for a massive increase in sales and her savings amount to 85 grand. She borrows 15K from Gopal and gives 1 lakh to Balaji asking him to submit it in the bank, which makes Balaji angry. He cannot believe that even his wife would think that her husband had stolen the money and leaves the house. He calls Bharani from a payphone and tells him that he cracked the vile plan of theirs. Meanwhile, Jhansi takes the help of her friend Gopal and calls the bank chairman to tell him about the false case. Everything falls in line at the end and the couple patch up their differences.
