He is mostly known for his works while in the Norwegian black metal band Ancient. His current projects are Thokkian Vortex (black metal) and Minimal Criminal (psygressive trance). His name is taken after Caiaphas, the high priest during the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus.  Biography  Born in Rio de Janeiro, Kaiaphas moved to Washington D.C., U.S. at six years old where he grew up. Most of his family members were musically inclined. His grandmother, on his father‚Äôs side, Nadir de Figueiredo, was a very famous soprano opera singer. It was not surprising that Kaiaphas would develop a strong passion for music. Throughout his teenage and adolescent years, Kaiaphas played drums and sang in several rock and metal bands, recorded several demo tapes, and played many gigs. Kaiaphas began his professional music career when he joined the Norwegian black metal band Ancient in 1995. The band's leader, Aphazel, was impressed by the work Kaiaphas had made with his prior American black metal bands - Grand Belial's Key and Thokk, so, therefore, Kaiaphas (then known as Lord Vlad Luciferian) replaced Ancient's previous member, Grimm. At this time, he changed his name to Lord Kaiaphas and began performing solely as a vocalist/frontman. During his time with Ancient, he recorded two full-length albums for the well-known American metal label, Metal Blade Records. These albums were The Cainian Chronicle and Mad Grandiose Bloodfiends. Kaiaphas also appeared in three music videos from Ancient, Lilith‚Äôs Embrace, Willothewisp, and Um Sonho Psycodelico. In 1997 the band went on a European tour with Bal Sagoth and Dark Funeral. Later that year, Mordgrimm Records released the Of Rape and Vampirism CD from Kaiaphas' former project, Thokk. The material from this CD came from their A Trance for the ever-toiling Witch demo which was recorded in 1995. In 1998, he went on an Ancient mini tour in America as well as another European tour alongside Belphegor and Behemoth. Shortly after this tour, Kaiaphas left Ancient. In 1996, Kaiaphas discovered psychedelic goa trance, and by 1999 he had become a trance DJ. In the fall of 1998, Kaiaphas moved to New Orleans, where he later formed a tribal gothic rock psychedelic rock band, called Oroboros, with his friend, Nicholas Syracuse. Oroboros played at the Burning Man Festival in 1999 and 2001. In this band, Kaiaphas played the drums, doumbek, djembe, and did some Tuvan/Mongolian style throat- singing. Their live shows consisted of tribal body paint, firedancing and fire breathing. Some of their tracks were later included in the soundtrack of the Canadian independent film, Monolithia. The band broke up in 2001. In 2002, Kaiaphas moved to Brazil, where the trance scene was growing rapidly. In 2003, Kaiaphas created a project of electronic body music called KAIAPHAS, with his friend, Victor Salles and female singer, T.A.T.I. In the beginning of 2006, the line-up had changed. Kaiaphas invited guitarist Lienhard, and new singer Lady Omega into the band. A year before meeting Kaiaphas, Lady Omega had sung on one of the songs from Ancient's Night Visit CD, released in 2004. Coincidentally, Kaiaphas had also made a guest appearance on that same album in the track, Rape the Children of Abel. He also performed as a special guest in a few of Ancient's gigs in Greece in the European mid-2003. While in Greece, Kaiaphas recorded some guest vocals on a few tracks from the Greek black metal band, Crossover, which ended up in their 2004 CD, Dogma. In 2003, Kaiaphas started a minimal/progressive psy-trance project called Minimal Criminal, under the alias \\"Zhyin\\" with Bruno Echoes. As of 2014, Minimal Criminal is Valerio Zhyin and its music often has a dark atmosphere and almost all of the tracks have stories or concepts behind them. The tracks also generally contain bizarre and obscure samples taken from films or other sources which further enhance the ideas behind the music. In 2005, Minimal Criminal released their debut track \\"Reefer and Barbeque\\", a collaboration with established Swedish artist Krumelur, on the Intelligent Manipulation compilation CD. Various tracks have been released in a variety of compilation albums by many labels. In 2016, a second full-length album, Valerian Tales and the Zeuhllander EP, were released by Quantum Digits Recordings. In 2017, another full-length album, Alien Anthology, was released by Soulectro Music. In 2006, Kaiaphas started his black metal solo project, Thokkian Vortex. The music from this project was influenced by the early works from Scandinavian black metal bands such as Darkthrone, Emperor, Dark Funeral, and Limbonic Art. There are also elements of classical/orchestral and dark ambient music. A split CD with the Hungarian band Aetheritus Obscuritas was released in 2007. The debut full-length album of Thokkian Vortex was released in 2014.

The school building was completed and opened in Menai Bridge in 1963 by Anglesey County Council which, ten years earlier (in 1953), had become the first education authority in the UK to adopt non-selective comprehensive education.\\"Two Centuries of Anglesey Schools\\" by David A Pretty (A.A.S. 1971) The new school in Menai Bridge catered for all the secondary pupils in South East Anglesey who up to then had been educated four miles away in Beaumaris, the former county town of Anglesey. History=Beaumaris Grammar School The Welsh name \\"Ysgol David Hughes\\" (David Hughes's School) is derived from that of the founder of the original Beaumaris Grammar School established 350 years earlier in the reign of Elizabeth I in 1603. Other than by nomenclature however \\"Ysgol David Hughes\\" in Menai Bridge has no connection whatever with the original Beaumaris Grammar School or with its founder, David Hughes. Founder of Beaumaris Grammar School The former Beaumaris Grammar School building, adjacent to Beaumaris Castle. The 1603 date can be seen above the door David Hughes (died 1609), the founder of Beaumaris Grammar School, was born in a stable of Llantrisant, Anglesey. He may have been the David Hughes of county Caernarvon, born 1561, who entered Gray's Inn from Magdalen College, Oxford, 28 January 1583 (Foster, Alumni. Oxon.; Gray's Inn Admission Register, 28 January 1582 ‚Äì 1583), but another account of him, contained in the papers of Christopher Wase (now held at Corpus Christi College, Oxford) states that he attended Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was appointed 'Tutor to a person of Qualitie who conferred upon him liberal Gratuities & settled upon him a Large Annuitie'. Hughes later lived in Norfolk and used his good fortune to build a 'considerable estate in money which afterwards hee left in his last Will & Testament for the Founding & Endowing of a Free School & Hospitall in & near Bowmaris [sic]'. Settling in Norfolk, he was appointed steward of the manor of Woodrising about 1596. In 1602 he procured a building in Beaumaris which was converted and opened as a Free Grammar School in 1603.\\"The Free Grammar School at Beaumaris\\" by Anthony D. Carr T.T.A.S.,1963 David Hughes's will, dated 30 December 1609, endowed the school and vested its administration in a body of feoffees (trustees) which he specified, should always include the Bishop of Bangor. He also laid down the terms on which \\"fellowships\\" (scholarships) should be established to enable deserving pupils to proceed directly from Beaumaris to the University of Oxford.\\"Elizabethan Wales\\" by G. Dyfnallt Owen (Cardiff,1964) and \\"Welsh Independent Grammar Schools to 1600\\" by L. Stanley Knight (Newtown 1926) In 1895 the management of the David Hughes charitable endowment (which had funded Beaumaris Grammar School) was transferred from the feoffees to Anglesey's new \\"County Governing Body\\" which now used the funds for the establishment of new county schools at Holyhead, Llangefni and Amlwch as well continuing to provide a proportion of funding for Beaumaris Grammar School.Anglesey County Governing Body Minutes 1894-1903 20th-century In 1953 the ancient Beaumaris Grammar School was combined with Beaumaris Secondary Modern School to become \\"Beaumaris Comprehensive School\\" following the Anglesey Council's decision to abolish the tripartite system, becoming the first local education authority to do so. When plans were announced to move the entire school away from Beaumaris to Menai Bridge there was considerable opposition from the people of Beaumaris to what they considered to be the arbitrary closure of their old school and the end of the centuries-old tradition of secondary education in the town.\\"North Wales Chronicle\\" 1953-1963 Facilities Ysgol David Hughes at Menai Bridge is divided into five blocks, A-D and New Block. It has a new sports hall with a fitness room with views of the Menai Strait and Snowdonia. The facility is open to the public in the evenings. There are approximately 1250 pupils at the school, from ages 11 to 18. The school has a large sports reputation and regularly competes against other schools in the area. The school is located at the top end of Menai Bridge and has views of both the Menai Suspension Bridge and Britannia Bridge. The school has excellent facilities with many classrooms having at least three PCs, every teacher has a laptop or PC and all classrooms have new electronic white boards. There are laboratories, kitchens and workshops as well as PC rooms in the school. The current headteacher is Mr H Emyr Williams. The school participates in a broad range of activities and extracurricular activities for pupils. Activities ranging from sports events to science competitions are offered annually for pupils of various ages and interests.  Welsh language  Welsh Government defines the school as a bilingual secondary school Category 2B, which means that, at least 80% of subjects (excluding Welsh and English) are taught through the medium of Welsh but are also taught through the medium of English. Most pupils have received their primary education through the medium of Welsh. According to the latest Estyn inspection report, approximately 90% of pupils could speak Welsh in 2012. In 2015, 68.7% of pupils aged 11‚Äì15 could speak Welsh fluently, with a further 31% being able to speak Welsh but not to a fluent standard, meaning that 99.7% of pupils in that age range were able to speak Welsh. 40.4% of all pupils spoke Welsh fluently at home as of January 2017.

The Abu Omar Case was the abduction and transfer to Egypt of the Imam of Milan Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar. The case was picked by the international media as one of the better-documented cases of extraordinary rendition carried out in a joint operation by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Italian Military Intelligence and Security Service (SISMI) in the context of the \\"global war on terrorism\\" declared by the Bush administration. Abu Omar was abducted on February 17, 2003, in Milan by agents of the SISMI and CIA, and transported to the Aviano Air Base, from which he was transferred to Egypt, where he was imprisoned for four years without charges, secluded, interrogated and \\"brutally tortured by America's long-standing ally, the Mubarak regime.\\"Glenn Greenwald: Italy's ex- intelligence chief given 10-year sentence for role in CIA kidnapping, The Guardian, 13 February 2013\\"I pm di Milano: arrestate gli agenti della Cia\\", Corriere della Sera, 24 June 2005. The CIA operation interrupted a surveillance program that was being carried out by Italian authorities into Nasr's alleged participation in Islamist organizations. Hassan Nasr was released by an Egyptian court in February 2007, which ruled that his detention was \\"unfounded\\". He has been indicted for international terrorism offenses in Italy since 2005. The Italian government originally denied having played any role in the abduction. However, Italian prosecutors Armando Spataro and Ferdinand Enrico Pomarici indicted 26 CIA agents, including the Rome station chief and head of CIA in Italy until 2003, Jeffrey W. Castelli, and Milan chief of base Robert Seldon Lady, as well as SISMI head General Nicol√≤ Pollari, his second Marco Mancini and station chiefs Raffaele Ditroia, Luciano Di Gregori and Giuseppe Ciorra.\\"Rapimento Abu Omar, a giudizio l'ex capo del Sismi Nicol√≤ Pollari\\", La Repubblica, 16 febbraio 2007. Referring to the Italian military intelligence agency, the Italian press has talked of a \\"CIA- SISMI concerted operation.\\" The prosecutors sent extradition requests for the indicted American citizens to the Italian Ministry of Justice, then headed by Roberto Castelli, for onward transmission to Washington. However, Castelli refused to forward the demand for extradition. The affair also created controversy within the CIA when the story came to light in 2005. Porter J. Goss, the director of the CIA at the time, ordered the agency's independent inspector general to begin a review of the operation. Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., then head of the National Clandestine Service (NCS), stopped the inspector general's review, stating that the NCS would investigate itself. In June 2009, Robert Seldon Lady, Milan CIA chief of base at the time, said \\"I'm not guilty. I'm only responsible for carrying out orders that I received from my superiors.\\" CIA officer Sabrina DeSousa, sentenced to five years in prison, said that the United States \\"broke the law ... and we are paying for the mistakes right now\\". On February 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal in Milan sentenced former SISMI director Nicol√≤ Pollari, his deputy director Marco Mancini, former Rome CIA station chief Castelli and two other CIA employees to up to 10 years in jail. Pollari has announced he will appeal against this ruling at the Corte Suprema di Cassazione. On February 24, 2014, the Corte Suprema di Cassazione, following a sentence of the Italian Corte Costituzionale regarding the use of secret evidence in the proceedings, acquitted Pollari and Mancini. Investigation of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr Hasaan Mustafa Osama Nasr was a radical Egyptian cleric and alleged member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya who had fled Egypt due to that group's prosecution as a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government. He was granted political asylum in Italy in 2001, and held an Italian asylum passport. As early as Spring 2002, he was under investigation by Italian and American intelligence agencies by means of wiretaps and physical and electronic surveillance. Italian authorities have claimed that they believed that they had evidence Nasr was building a network to recruit terrorists, and possibly had links to Al Qaeda. They alleged in particular links with Ansar al-Islam and ties to a network sending combatants in the Iraqi Kurdistan.World Politics Review. Who is Abu Omar? Extracts from the Italian Police Surveillance Tapes However, citing a book on Al-Qaeda by Jason Burke, a British reporter at The Observer, La Repubblica noted in June 2005 that in 2002, before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration was claiming, along with British prime minister Tony Blair, that Iraq maintained close links with Al-Qaeda, in particular through Ansar al-Islam. The Italian newspaper concluded that the Abu Omar case was a \\"chapter in the combination of intelligence‚Äìpsychological warfare‚Äìinformation war engaged by Washington and London to justify the invasion of Iraq.\\"L'imam rapito a Milano dalla Cia ‚Äì I silenzi e la complicit√† con Washington, La Repubblica, June 28, 2005 Liptak, A.

There are also reports that Nasr was involved in plotting a terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Rome, and was suspected of being involved in a plot to bomb a number of children of foreign diplomats attending the American School of Milan, although sources disagree whether such plots even existed.Crewdson, J. and T. Hundley. (2005). \\"Abducted imam aided CIA ally in war on terror\\". The Chicago Tribune, July 2, 2005. Most observers have come to believe that Nasr was abducted by the United States as a source of intelligence on foreign combatants being recruited to fight in Iraq, which, at the time, the United States had yet to invade. Abduction and rendition to Egypt On February 17, 2003, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr was abducted by persons affiliated with the CIA as he walked to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers.Auditions sur le rapt d'un imam par la CIA, Le Figaro, February 24, 2006 According to court documents, Nasr was pushed into a minivan on Via Giuseppe Guerzoni in Milan and driven four or five hours to a joint Italian-U.S. air base at Aviano, where he was tortured. From there, he was flown by a Lear jet (using the call sign SPAR 92) to Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Germany launched an official investigation due to false imprisonment and coercion, but the case was ultimately dropped as it could not be determined which CIA agents were involved in the abduction. SPAR (Special Air Resources) is the call sign used by US senior military officers and civilian VIPs for airlift transport.Hooper, J. (2005). \\"CIA methods exposed by kidnap inquiry\\". The Guardian UK, July 2, 2005.US military planes criss-cross Europe using bogus call sign, The Sunday Times, February 19, 2006 A second plane then took him to Cairo, where he was imprisoned and, he claims, tortured. In April 2004, while his incarceration had been downgraded to house arrest, Nasr placed several phone calls from Egypt to his family and friends. He told them he had been rendered into the hands of Egypt's SSI at Tura prison, twenty miles south of Cairo. He was subjected to various depredations, tortured by beating and electric shocks to the genitals, raped,ABU OMAR: \\"IN EGITTO FUI STUPRATO, BERLUSCONI LO SAPPIA\\", La Repubblica, and eventually had lost hearing in one ear. At the time of the calls he had been released on the orders of an Egyptian judge because of lack of evidence. Shortly after those calls were made he was re-arrested and placed back in prison. Nasr was not released again until February 11, 2007, at which time he was permitted to return to his family. After four years of detention, an Egyptian court ruled that his imprisonment was \\"unfounded.\\"International Herald Tribune, February 16, 2007, Italy indicts 31 linked to CIA rendition case In 2006, Nasr's lawyer Montasser el-Zayat said Nasr was underfed but there were \\"no signs of torture.\\"\\"Abducted imam seeks return to Italy\\" , ANSA, April 7, 2006 Investigation and warrants for CIA operatives The CIA agents were implicated, in part, by extensive cellphone records which allowed Milan police to reconstruct their movements for the nine days they were in the city. Because the agents had apparently not, at any time, removed the batteries from their cellphones, investigators were able to pinpoint their locations from moment to moment. The agents also made numerous phone calls to the US consulate in Milan, to northern Virginia (where the CIA headquarters are located) and to friends and family in the United States. The operation was led by Robert Seldon Lady, former CIA chief of base in Milan, who was then operating out of the U.S. embassy under diplomatic cover as the \\"Consul of the United States in Milan.\\" The operation was carried out by the CIA's Special Activities Division. Lady has said that he opposed the abduction plans, but was overruled.BBC. (2007). \\"Italy orders CIA kidnapping trial\\". BBC.com, February 16, 2007. Lady has since retired from he CIA, which puts him in a precarious legal position, as the status of his diplomatic immunity is now in doubt. In December 2005, CIA Director Porter Goss ordered a sweeping review of the agency's field operations because of what he perceived as the Milan rendition's \\"sloppiness\\".Crewdson, J. (2005). \\"The CIA's bungled Italy Job\\". The Chicago Tribune, December 25, 2005. In June 2005, Italian judge Guido Salvini issued warrants for the arrest of 22 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA, including Jeffrey W. Castelli, head of the CIA in Italy until 2003. Salvini said the abduction was illegal because it violated Italian sovereignty and international law and disrupted an ongoing police investigation. He also issued a warrant for the arrest of Nasr, on charges of associating with terrorists. In November 2005, Italian prosecutors requested that Italy's Justice Ministry seek the extradition of the suspects from the United States. The Italian government declined. In December 20, 2005, an Italian court issued a European arrest warrant against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including Robert Seldon Lady, Eliana Castaldo, Lt. Col. Joseph L. Romano, III, etc.).CNN. (2005). \\"Italy warrants for 22 purported CIA operatives\\". CNN.com, December 23, 2005. , published by Statewatch, 22 June 2005 It is possible that some of the names for the targets of the warrant were pseudonyms. Regarding \\"Eliana Castaldo\\", a reporter's attempts to contact her through the number listed on the affidavit produced inconsistent responses: one refused to identify the business, another said she was with an answering service, while a third said the number was that of a firm by the name of Washburn and Company. Each of the persons answering denied there was an Eliana Castaldo reachable at that number. In April 2006, just after the Italian general election, outgoing Justice Minister Roberto Castelli (Lega Nord) told prosecutors that he had decided not to pass the extradition request to the United States. One of the \\"concerted CIA-SISMI operations\\" The abduction occurred without the knowledge of the Italian intelligence and law enforcement officials working directly on the Nasr case, who initially suspected that Nasr had been kidnapped by the Egyptian government, possibly with the cooperation of other branches of the Italian government. When the Italians questioned their American counterparts about Nasr's disappearance, they were told he had traveled voluntarily to the Balkans. Furthermore, Italian officials initially denied the Italian government had authorized or sanctioned a US operation to kidnap Nasr. Italian Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Carlo Giovanardi, member of Silvio Berlusconi's second and third government, said in no uncertain terms to the Italian parliament: \\"Our secret services were not aware of the operation ... It was never brought to the attention of the government or national institutions.\\" However, former CIA officials contradicted this by claiming the agency had secured the consent of Italian intelligence, and that the CIA's station chief in Rome, Jeffrey W. Castelli, had been granted explicit permission for the operation by his Italian counterpart.Wilkinson, T. and G. Miller. (2005). \\"Italy Says It Didn't Know of CIA Plan\\". The Los Angeles Times, July 1, 2005. Furthermore, the circumstances of Nasr's abduction tended to accredit the thesis of at least passive support of the operation by Italian intelligence services. In particular, questions were raised by the CIA agents' startling laxity in travel arrangements. By all accounts, they did little to cover their tracks. Instead of fleeing immediately, most of them remained in Italy days after the operation, in some of Milan's best hotels. Only some of them used aliases. The rest traveled with their normal passports and drivers licenses, paid for things with credit cards in their real names, chatted openly on cell phones before, during, and after the operation. After the abduction, they even carelessly bypassed speed limits in Milan. Some have speculated this represents evidence of Italian complicity, as little apparent effort was made to obfuscate the identities of the participants. This hypothesis was confirmed by Italian investigations. On July 5, 2006, two high-ranking Italian intelligence officers were arrested by Italian police for their complicity in Abu Omar's kidnapping. These included Marco Mancini, number 2 of SISMI, Italy's military intelligence agency, and Gustavo Pignero, the agency's chief for the northern region of Italy. Italian wiretaps caught Mancini admitting that he had lied about his involvement in the abduction case. These arrests signaled the first official admission that Italian intelligence agents were involved in the abduction. Additionally, the former head of SISMI's Milan office, Col. Stefano D'Ambrosio, claims that he was removed from his position by his superiors because of his objections to the abduction plot; he was later replaced by Mancini.Wilkinson, T. (2006). \\"Italian Probe Broadens Beyond Abduction: Prosecutors in the case of a Muslim cleric seek evidence of illegal spying by intelligence officers. Some journalists also may be involved.\\" The Los Angeles Times, July 7, 2006. Thus, public prosecutors Armando Spataro and Pomarici have described the abduction as \\"a concerted CIA-SISMI operation\\" organized by \\"Italian and American agents\\" with the aim of the \\"capture\\" and \\"secret transfer\\" of the imam to Egypt.Paolo Biondani and Guido Olimpio. July 11, 2006 Corriere della Sera, \\"Un centro segreto Cia-Sismi\\" available here Paolo Biondani and Italian counter- terrorist expert Guido Olimpio cited the November 18, 2005, article published by Dana Priest in The Washington Post, where she described the CTIC (Counter- Terrorism Intelligence Center), a \\"joint operation centers in more than two dozen countries where U.S. and foreign intelligence officers work side by side to track and capture suspected terrorists and to destroy or penetrate their networks.Dana Priest, The Washington Post, November 18, 2005. Foreign Network at Front of CIA's Terror Fight ‚Äì Joint Facilities in Two Dozen Countries Account for Bulk of Agency's Post-9/11 Successes \\" Italy was not included in this international alliance of intelligence agencies, which largest base was in Paris, named Alliance Base. According to Guido Olimpio and Paolo Biondani, Italy was not included in the CTIC because of internal jealousy between various Italian intelligence agencies. But they noted that, despite that, the arrest ordinance against Marco Mancini and his superior General Gustavo Pignero referred to the operation as an example of the \\"non orthodox activity\\" (the only one known of) realized by the CIA and the SISMI \\"since 2002,\\" thus demonstrating some sort of cooperation between US and Italian intelligence agencies, albeit not in the frame of the CTIC. Furthermore, according to testimonies by SISMI agents to the Italian justice, Mancini proposed himself to the CIA as a \\"double agent \\" According to Colonel Stefano D'Ambrosio, former SISMI responsible in Milan replaced by Mancini, the CIA refused to hire the latter because they considered him too \\"venal.\\" But his demand \\"left traces in the computer\\" of the US intelligence. All SISMI testimonies converge in saying that Mancini owed his dazzling career to his \\"privileged relations with the CIA. \\" According to SISMI testimony, after the February 17, 2003 kidnapping of Hassan Mustafa Nasr, then CIA director George Tenet sent a letter to SISMI General Nicol√≤ Pollari in August 2003, to which Mancini would allegedly owe the real reasons of his promotion to number 2 of the SISMI. In another, earlier article, the same author, Guido Olimpio, wrote that following the abduction of the imam, SISMI informed the Italian government and then the CIA, assuring them that no agent who had taken part in this covert operation would be prosecuted. In turn, CIA director George Tenet would have sent a letter to Forte Braschi, the SISMI headquarters in Rome.E il Sismi tese la mano ai nemici della Cia, Corriere della Sera, October 31, 2005 Furthermore, apart of the July 2006 arrest of Marco Mancini, n¬∞2 of the SISMI, and of Gustavo Pignero, the agency's chief for the northern region of Italy, the head of SISMI General Nicol√≤ Pollari had to resign in November 2006 because of the affair and was indicted in December by the Milanese judges. The trial In addition to the 22 European arrest warrants issued in December 2005 and the arrest of the above-mentioned SISMI officers, an Italian judge issued additional arrest warrants for four Americans, three CIA agents and for Lieutenant Colonel Joseph L. Romano III, commander of security forces at the Aviano Air Base at the time, now working at Section 31b of the Pentagon. Ultimately, twenty-six Americans and nine Italians (including head of SISMI Nicol√≤ Pollari, n¬∞2 of the same intelligence agency Marco Mancini, as well as General Gustavo Pignero; and also the junior ROS officer Giuliano Pironi) were indicted.Rapt d'un imam √† Milan: la CIA va devoir s'expliquer, Lib√©ration, February 16, 2007 The trial would be the first criminal trial related to the U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition. The start of the trial was set for June 8, 2007, although it was adjourned until October 2007, pending an upcoming ruling by Italy's Constitutional Court regarding the possible violation of state secrecy laws by Milan prosecutors who used phone taps on Italian agents during their investigation.The Middle East Times. (2007). \\"CIA trial in Italy adjourned to October 24\\" . The Middle East Times. Retrieved June 24, 2007. Two other Italian suspects reached plea bargains. Giuliano Pironi, who admitted stopping Nasr and controlling his identity during the kidnapping, was given a suspended sentence of one year, nine months and a day.

He later realized he had been instrumentalized Gli investigatori del caso Abu Omar: cos√¨ ci ha aiutato a incastrare il Sismi, Corriere della Sera, July 23, 2006 Marco Mancini admitted to Milan prosecutors having followed orders of his superior General Pignero, who himself obeyed requests from Jeff Castelli, CIA head in Italy, to the director of the SISMI, General Pollari. Mancini confessed having organised a meeting in Bologna with all the heads of the SISMI centers. He illustrated on this occasion the plan for the abduction. The arrest warrants issued on June 15, 2006 against Jeff Castelli, other US agents, Mancini and Pignero were done on these grounds. In the meantime, Milan prosecutor Armando Spataro found out the existence of an office, in the centre of Rome, linked to SISMI, in charge of 'secret operations.' It was directed by a close collaborator of head of SISMI Pollari. According to the European Parliament \\"Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transport and the Illegal Detention of Prisoners\\", headed by rapporteur Giovanni Claudio Fava: > The main target of this office consisted in distorting the national press > information, through journalists ad hoc hired by SISMI, by editing false > reports with the aim to keep high the \\"terrorism alert\\" vis-√†-vis the public > opinion. Among the duties also the one of chasing and tapping the > communications of the two journalists of the newspaper \\"La Repubblica\\" in > charge of the Abu Omar case: Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo. In a secretly registered conversation General Pignero, Mancini's superior, confirmed having met SISMI director Pollari right after a meeting with Jeff Castelli, head of the CIA in Italy. He said on this occasion that he had received by Pollari a list of names, among others that of Abu Omar, and to have been ordered to observe the Egyptian cleric in view of his abduction. Pignero then ordered Mancini to proceed with all these activities. Interrogated by the Milan prosecutor in July 2006, General Pollari involved the Italian government and invoked a classified document. Romano Prodi's government has confirmed its classified status. During his hearing in August 2006 before the Italian Parliamentary Committee on Secret services control (Copaco), Pollari defended himself again invoking the raison d'√©tat. In October 2006, prosecutor Spataro transmitted to the European Temporary Committee a copy of a SISMI document, from which it comes out that SISMI was informed by the CIA on May 15, 2003 that Abu Omar was interrogated in Cairo by Egyptian services. , the Italian government's responsible for secret services, declared to the European committee that the Berlusconi administration had classified files related to the Abu Omar case, and that the Prodi administration confirmed such secrecy. Any trial of American citizens is expected to happen in absentia. The United States is not expected to extradite the CIA operatives. As of February 2007, the Italian government has issued no extradition requests, although the Italian judiciary has been calling for the government to do so since 2005. Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, member of the new government of Romano Prodi, Prime minister of Italy since the 2006 general election, has still given no news of the extradition request given to him by Armando Spataro, the Milanese public prosecutor. Current Minister of Infrastructures and former prosecutor of Milan, Antonio di Pietro, has criticized on February 15, 2007, his governmental colleagues, claiming that the refuse to transmit the extradition requests to the US abounded to \\"cover an illegal operation, the kidnapping of a person.\\" Freed on February 11, 2007, Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr has deposed a complaint against former Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, demanding 10 million Euro of damage and interests \\"for his implication in the kidnapping as chief of the government [during the events] and for having permitted the CIA to capture him.\\"La justice italienne pr√©pare le proc√®s des vols de la CIA, Le Monde, February 17, 2007 The Italian executive has opposed the judges in Milan, by deposing a recourse before the Constitutional Court against Armando Spataro, charging him of having violated state secret by using the wiretaps recordings of SISMI agents.

Three Americans, including the then-Rome CIA station chief Jeffrey Castelli and two other diplomats formerly assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Rome, as well as the former head of Italian military intelligence Nicolo Pollari and four other Italian secret service agents were acquitted due to diplomatic immunity.Shapira, Ian, \\"Kidnapping unravels a spy‚Äôs career\\", The Washington Post, 12 July 2012 All but two Italians were tried in absentia, and, as long as the verdicts remain in place, the 23 convicted Americans cannot travel to Europe without risking arrest. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly expressed disappointment over the verdicts. Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff S. Morrell said that the judge had ignored requests for Lieutenant Colonel Romano's case to be moved to the United States, adding that \\"Our view is the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lieutenant Colonel Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges. Now that they have not, we will, of course, explore what options we have going forward.\\" The CIA declined to comment. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi denied knowledge of any kidnap operation, and criticized the trial claiming that it could hurt Italy's international reputation. In September 2012, Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, upheld the guilty verdicts that had been handed down by lower courts. The Italian government has not stated whether it would seek extradition of the convicted Americans.Barry, Colleen, and Frances D'Emilio, \\"Italy court upholds American convictions\\", Yahoo! News, 20 September 2012 On February 13, 2013, the Milano Court of Appeals sentenced former SISMI director Nicol√≤ Pollari to 10 years in jail and awarded 1.5 million Euro in damages to Abu Omar and his wife. Pollari's deputy director Marco Mancini has been sentenced to 9 years in jail, the former CIA station chief Jeffrey Castelli in absentia to 7 years in jail, along with two other CIA employees. Pollari has announced he will appeal against this ruling at the Corte Suprema di Cassazione. Sabrina De Sousa was detained at the Lisbon airport in Portugal on October 5, 2015. She was due to be extradited to Italy, but a partial pardon from the Italian president - in February 2017 - reduced the sentence from 4 to 3 years which was then commuted to community service for which extradition is not possible. The original sentence was already reduced from 7 to 4 years through a general amnesty law in 2006. Political context The expos√© of the incident, coming just before Italy's general election, was a major embarrassment for the Berlusconi administration.Wilkinson, T. (2005). \\"Court Widens Net for 22 CIA Agents to EU\\". The Los Angeles Times, December 24, 2005. If it had admitted foreknowledge of or complicity in the operation, it would have been admitting that one part of the government (its intelligence services) deliberately undermined the efforts of another (its judiciary). If it had denied any involvement, it would point to a serious lapse in Italian security, as it would mean foreign intelligence agencies would be able to pull off major operations within Italy, right under the nose of Italy's own intelligence agencies, with virtual impunity. Either way, most observers thought it clear Silvio Berlusconi did not wish the case to proceed. He initially told the press that he did not believe the CIA was responsible for the abduction, and even if they were responsible, it was a justifiable action. He was widely quoted in the press as having said, \\"You can't tackle terrorism with a law book in your hand.\\". He then declared to the ANSA agency: \\"This is a trial we absolutely should not have, and its result will be that our intelligence services will no longer have the cooperation of foreign intelligence\\". The Abu Omar case poses the problem of Italy's involvement in the US \\"War on Terror\\". The incident also served to highlight tensions between Italy's fiercely independent judiciary and its executive administration (including the intelligence services), which would have preferred the judiciary didn't press the issue with the United States. During the Italian investigations into the incident, it was discovered that not only had SISMI (or a division of it) collaborated with the CIA in the abduction, it had also been illegally surveiling Italian citizens, particularly Italian magistrates unfriendly to the Berlusconi administration, often with the help of Italian journalists. Italian prosecutors believed reporters from right-wing paper Libero used interviews with the lead prosecutor in the abduction case, Armando Spataro, as a pretext to glean confidential information to pass on to SISMI agents. On July 6, 2006, Libero's offices were raided by Italian police. CIA chief of base admission In June 2009, Robert Seldon Lady, Milan CIA chief of base at the time, was quoted by Il Giornale newspaper saying \\"I'm not guilty. I'm only responsible for carrying out orders that I received from my superiors,\\" He denied criminal responsibility because it was a \\"state matter.\\" \\"I console myself by reminding myself that I was a soldier, that I was in a war against terrorism, that I couldn't discuss orders given to me.\\" Lady's retirement villa has been seized by magistrates to cover court costs. In July 2013, Lady was arrested in Panama on an international arrest warrant. The next day, he was released.

At the Riga Summit NATO nations agreed to lift caveats in a time of an emergency, however the definition of an emergency is debatable. The problem of National Caveats is not new and was identified as a problem during the KFOR mission in Kosovo in 1999. NATO leaders met in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2005 to address the matter of national caveats. They passed RESOLUTION 336 on REDUCING NATIONAL CAVEATS, but the resolution was non-binding, meaning that nations could apply it as they deemed fit.COL Douglas Mastriano, US Army, \\"Faust and the Padshah Sphinx: Reshaping the NATO Alliance to Win in Afghanistan \\", June 2010, http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix;=html&identifier;=ADA518150  Riga Summit  In November 2006, NATO held the Riga Summit. At the meetings, President George W. Bush called for countries to lift caveats. However, many analysts say the problem has not been solved. For instance, political scientist Joseph Nye stated in a 2006 article that \\"many NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan have \\"national caveats\\" that restrict how their troops may be used. While the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the US are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north.

The 28 nation alliance is now leading the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Mission in Afghanistan, with some forty-eight diverse nations engaged in the nation building operation. Adding to an already complex task, many of the nations in the mission, whether NATO or not, have attached national caveat restrictions on their forces. This has created opportunities for the insurgents in parts of the country, whilst also causing no small degree of friction within the NATO Alliance proper between those nations willing to send their soldiers to the dangerous parts of the country (to fight), and those not willing to do so.Colonel Douglas Mastriano, US Army, \\"Faust and the Padshah Sphinx: Reshaping the NATO Alliance to Win in Afghanistan \\", June 2010, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA518150&Location;=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf US Army Colonel Douglas Mastriano, in a research project at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, discussed the challenges that this dilemma poses to the alliance, and although daunting, argues that one should expect this from a system of independent nations that have divergent interests and political will in regard to Afghanistan. He argues that strategic leaders have to operate with what nations are willing to give and thereby leverage NATO's troops where they can do the most good. Despite the difficulties, Mastriano says, \\"When one looks at the ISAF mission holistically, Afghanistan has been good for the alliance. It has expanded its global role, demonstrated that it can conduct a sustained out of area mission, NATO can operate with coalition partners from around the world, it has endurance (now ten years in Afghanistan, and counting) and that it is not easily be intimidated.

As Andrei Antonov writes, \\"the way Litvinenko sees it, the FSB is clearly a criminal and even terrorist organization. And not only because of apartment explosions or alleged conspiracy against Berezovsky. Litvinenko is certain that security services were behind the murder of Galina Starovoitova, a prominent figure in Russia's democracy movement, and the death of Anatoly Sobchak, and many, many other things.\\" Alan Cowell praised the book as an important source that described the attempted assassination of Boris Berezovsky in Moscow and many other events.Russian Ex-Spy Lived in a World of Deceptions, by Alan Cowell, New York Times, December 3, 2006 See also *Mafia state ReferencesBibliography Books about the Federal Security Service Politics of Russia Works about organized crime in Russia Alexander Litvinenko Censorship in Russia Books about Vladimir Putin ","title":"Lubyanka Criminal Group"},{"id":"9637135","text":"Painstation at the Games Convention 2006 Painstation is an art object and arcade game based on Pong developed by the artists' group, \\"/////////fur//// art entertainment interfaces\\", with pain feedback. History The system was originally developed by Tilman Reiff and Volker Morawe, two students at the Kunsthochschule f√ºr Medien K√∂ln (Academy of Media Arts Cologne) in 2001, as an interactive art object. The pair later enhanced the device and released it under the company name of the \\"//////////fur//// art entertainment interfaces\\".See Painstation-Neuzeitliches Duellierungs Artefakt (Painstation - Modern Duelling artifact) The designers were inspired by the children's game Folter-Mau-MauOn the Media, June 27, 2003, Transcript and interview as .mp3 at They Like Pain(Station) and the development of the modern computer game. A similar game concept was featured in the 1983 James Bond movie Never Say Never Again. The original concept was followed up with other stages of development which were regularly exhibited worldwide in different cultural contexts. Following talks with Sony, the artists described the Painstation as \\"The artwork formerly known as Painstation\\". Structure While the underlying artistic concept remained consistent over the years, the group continues to improve on the system. Basic Concept The Painstation consists of a specially made case which gives two players the opportunity of playing a specially adapted and expanded variant of the classic video game, Pong, against each other. The electronic controls are connected by digital transducers to several components providing sensory feedback to players. During the game, the players place their left hands on the PEU (Pain Execution Unit) which serves as a sensor and feedback instrument. Possible feedback effects are heat impulses, an electric shock and an integrated miniature wire whip. The feedback generated is dependent on the playing process and can increase in its intensity. The respective opponent can try to alter his or her playing style to purposely change the intensity of the feedback. The following bonus items can be activated by hits in the current version of the software in 2006: *Increase Ball Speed (3 levels) *Double Pain Execution Time *Quadruple Pain Execution Time *Almost Unblockable Ricochet *Cut Height of Bar By 50% *Deadly Row *Electric Boogaloo *Burn In Bright *Death Penalty *Cheese! *Ease the Pain! *Cluster Bomb No matter the score, the first player to remove his or her hand from the PEU device loses the game.Sample video (QuickTime) at Painstation - Do you feel the pain? Painstation The heart of the original system was the Apple Computer G3 Macintosh, as well as a specifically made control plate. The programming was done with Macromedia Director and C++. The model was developed predominately out of available junk using a tube monitor. The first five high scores were originally computer generated absurdly high as a deterrent, but one entry was actually overwritten by a player at the Games Convention in 2006. Since then, \\"GOL\\" is on the list in second place with 300 points. Painstation 2.0 Starting in 2002, the successor of the original Painstation was developed, the Painstation 2.0. Apart from adjustable pain levels, it offers several replaceable whips and an additional source of light which players can use to produce glare on their opponent's side of the screen. The program was reprogrammed under Windows and the application was implemented in C++ and OpenGL, because the hardware the previous version had been based on became obsolete. The PEUs were fabricated for the first time with lasers from stainless steel. The higher processor performance makes it possible for the system to control the speed of the whip engine and the strength of the electric current individually. The system was also for the first time made coin-operated. It is equipped with a 15-inch LCD monitor and it was shown to the public on June 25, 2003 on the German Harald Schmidt television show.See Even more enhanced duelling artefact, online at PainStation 2.0 The Collection (Description of all models with further hints) Painstation 2.5 The new case, painted in three metallic colors, consists mostly of medium density wood fiber panels and has a modular design. This makes it easier to transport the system and to exchange defective components. Besides a 15-inch color screen, there is standard PC technology inside and a special control plate. The pain levels can be changed from 50% to 150%. The player must confirm that they are willing to participate in the game by pressing an \\"I agree\\" button before playing. Added benefits for the players include leather padded arm rests and the new ergonomic layout of the controls. Newly added fans in the PEUs cool the system down better between games to avoid electronic problems and can serve the players if they hit the right bonus item.

Retrieved 14 June 2010. In 2017, the Authority had operating expenses of $119.76 million, an outstanding debt of $2.654 billion, and a staffing level of 326 people. History NYSERDA is New York's energy agency. It provides analysis, programs, technical expertise, and funding to increase energy efficiency, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Emerging Authority During the energy crisis of the 1970s, oil embargoes made the United States acutely aware that the world's petroleum supplies were finite. Nancy J. Ayers, the executive director for the New York Senate's Consumer Protection Committee and a longtime environmental activist, was considered the originator of the idea for the agency. NYSERDA's earliest efforts focused solely on research and development of renewable energy technologies with the goal of reducing New York State's petroleum consumption. NYSERDA was created as a public benefit corporation in 1975 under Article 8, Title 9 and Title 9A of the State Public Authorities Law through the reconstitution of the New York State Atomic and Space Development Authority. In the 1980s, lines disappeared at gas stations but concerns about energy's impact on the environment would continue. Separate from NYSERDA during that time, the New York State Energy Office handled energy policy analysis and energy efficiency audits. Funding was derived primarily from federal grants and monies distributed via the Petroleum Overcharge Restitution Fund. When the Energy Office was closed in 1995, NYSERDA took on critical energy efficiency, energy assessments, energy planning, and policy analysis functions. The national recession in the 1990s emphasized the need to help New York State residents and businesses increase energy efficiency in order to save money. Simultaneous global events highlighted the need for energy security and less reliance on foreign sources of oil, and signaled a renewed need for increased focus on protecting the environment. In Transition NYSERDA's funding structure changed in 1998 when the New York State Public Service Commission approved the ratepayer- supported System Benefits Charge (SBC) Program and designated NYSERDA as the program's administrator. The SBC is collected by investor-owned utilities from gas and electric customers in the State, and funds the majority of NYSERDA's programs. The Public Service Commission also established in 1998 the nationally recognized, long-running New York Energy $mart Program to continue public benefit research and development, energy services, and environmental programs that may not have otherwise happened as New York State moved to a competitive electric utility industry. In the new millennium, NYSERDA became involved in green buildings while new kinds of energy crises made headlines. In 2000 and 2001, California's electricity crisis, rolling blackouts, and energy market manipulations in 2000 and 2001 highlighted how dependent the nation was on the electric grid. The 2002 New York State Energy Plan then noted possible consequences of New York State's heavy dependence on fossil fuel, which is largely imported from abroad or out-of-state. In response, NYSERDA took steps toward a proactive approach for New York State's energy future. Leading Change As renewable energy was becoming popular in other parts of the country, New York State wanted to make it attractive to the State's residents and businesses. Between 2004 and 2008, the Public Service Commission approved two new programs related to funding renewable energy and energy efficiency as NYSERDA pursued a market-driven approach to doing business including creating effective partnerships among private industry, government, and academia that benefit all New Yorkers. In 2004, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was established with the goal of increasing the proportion of renewable energy used by New Yorkers. In 2008, the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard(EEPS) was created with a specific directive: reduce electricity usage in New York. New York State also took pioneering steps in 2008 to address greenhouse gas emissions related to energy. New York became a charter member of a cooperative effort by nine Northeast and Mid- Atlantic states called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). RGGI is the first mandatory, market-based effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Proceeds from auction and trading of carbon dioxide allowances help fund some of NYSERDA's programs. As the national economy began a downturn in 2008, New Yorkers struggled too. NYSERDA worked toward sustainability goals, supporting the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Frontier Research Centers Program and focusing on the 4 E's: energy, environment, economy, and education. Establishing a Clean Energy Economy NYSERDA Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP), Malta, New York By 2010, NYSERDA programs focused on reducing energy use, increasing energy efficiency, creating jobs, \\"creating public-private partnerships to stimulate entrepreneurial spirit\\", and \\"preparing tomorrow's workforce to excel in the clean energy economy\\". To reinforce this focus, the Public Service Commission approved funding for the Technology and Market Development Program in 2011. In 2014, NY Green Bank, a state-sponsored, specialized financial entity and a division of NYSERDA, opened for business to increase private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, which have had difficulty accessing financing. Announced by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo in his 2013 State of the State address, the development of a Green Bank in New York aimed at facilitating more reliable, more efficient energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP) is a 280-acre site in Malta, New York focused on clean energy. The site is approved for 1.25 million square feet of office, research and development, and light manufacturing, along with 77% green space.

An Olmec-style bottle, reputedly from Las Bocas, 1100 - 800 BCE. Las Bocas is a minor archaeological site in the Mexican state of Puebla, whose name has become attached, often erroneously, to a wide- ranging type of Olmec-style figurines and pottery. The Las Bocas site, part of the Balsas River basin, was heavily plundered in the 1960s by looters looking for \\"Olmec\\" pottery and figurines. As the prestige associated with \\"Las Bocas\\" artifacts grew, that label was given to many similar artifacts ‚Äì and occasional forgeries ‚Äì of unknown origin.Grove. The high numbers of artifacts attributed to the site are \\"implausible at best\\",Pool, p. 210, who states that the plunder of Las Bocas is \\"one of the most egregrious examples of looting in the annals of Mesoamerican archaeology.\\" and as a result, the term \\"Las Bocas\\" has now little archaeological significance. The first systematic archaeological investigation of Las Bocas was begun by David Grove in 1967. In 1997, the archaeologist Maria de la Cruz Paill√©s Hern√°ndez started the first of her three seasons at the site.  Field Seasons: 1997-2000 = Funding  The first field season of Maria de la Cruz Paill√©s Hern√°ndez, in 1997, was funded that same year by INAH (Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia) in the amount of $30,000 pesos. The second field season, 1998, also funded by INAH, was supplied with $23,000 pesos and had to be shortened to 21 days. Originally, the third field season had been scheduled for 1999, but funding was not available that year. In 2000, FAMSI (Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc.) gave $7,800 USD to Paill√©s Hern√°ndez for the third field season via INAH, but INAH delayed in relaying the funds for a month and a half, causing the third field season to take place during rains.Paill√©s Hern√°ndez p. 10  Archaeological Work  The second field season was intended to yield a general overview of the contexts of the Las Bocas site, and to determine areas to be explored later. Paill√©s Hern√°ndez considered the Las Bocas site to include the nearby Caballo Pintado because of relevant sites found in the area. The third field season continued the work of the second field season and referenced its findings for a greater understanding of context. Several pits were excavated during the third field season; some stratigraphy was found to be unreliable because of the facts that, the artifacts near the surface had mixed dates, and \\"the land surface was removed with heavy machinery back in 1994,\\"Paill√©s Hern√°ndez p. 18 almost completely destroying the classic and post-classic artifacts. A looter's pit was also found while excavating. Findings Several ceramic pieces were found during the third field season of Paill√©s Hern√°ndez; these dated from as early as the Ayotla phase (1250-1000 B.C.) to the Manantial phase (1000-800 B.C.) of the formative stage. The pieces found included several fragments of figurines. The head of a \\"baby-face\\" figurine was found with a similar cranial deformation to an Olmec skull found at Pampa el Paj√≥n.Paill√©s Hern√°ndez p. 44 Carved stone objects were also found during the third field season; they were composed of obsidian and either silex or chert. The burial of an adult individual was uncovered during the third field season of 2000, it was the second burial found at the site. It was found with a cajete, a small figurine of a dog, and fragments of a small box.  Las Bocas-style Figurines =Description The term \\"Las Bocas-style\\" refers to a style of Olmec figurine allegedly found at the Las Bocas site. The style is defined by looted materials that may or may not have actually come from the Las Bocas site. Credibility of Origin The term \\"Las Bocas-style\\" is based on a fallacy; the Las Bocas-style figurines were never connected to the actual Las Bocas site. They were only claimed to have been found on the site by those who sold them on the art market contemporaneously with the occurrences of looting at Las Bocas. With their advertised origins, the figurines received higher market prices and considerably more interest ‚Äì consequentially, those who sold them may have been motivated to misrepresent the origins of artifacts that were possibly found at other sites. Because of the lack of contextual evidence to link the figurines with Las Bocas, and the high probability of improperly represented origins, the Las Bocas-style figurines cannot be attributed to the site of Las Bocas.Yates  Notes References *Grove, David C.

The authors describe the Russian apartment bombings as a false flag operation that was guided by the Russian Federal Security Service to justify the Second Chechen War and bring Vladimir Putin to power. The story was initially printed by Yuri Shchekochikhin in a special issue of Novaya Gazeta in August 2001 and published as a book in 2002. In Russia the book was prohibited because it divulged state secrets, and it was included in the Federal List of Extremist Materials.

Viv Groskop for The Observer wrote, that the book \\"rehashes the well-known argument that the 1999 terrorist bombing campaign that precipitated Russia's second war with Chechnya and propelled Putin to the presidency was in fact organised by Russia's own security services. David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times, has written authoritatively on the subject.\\" According to her, the book focuses \\"in excruciating, rambling detail\\" on the failed attempt by FSB agents to plant a bomb in a residential building in the city of Ryazan, but it fails to describe convincingly the overall involvement of Russian state security services in organizing the bombings.

A separate language, Sequential Pascal, is used as the language for applications programs run by the operating systems written in Concurrent Pascal. Both languages are extensions of Niklaus Wirth's Pascal, and share a common threaded code interpreter. The following describes how Concurrent Pascal differs from Wirth's Pascal. Language description Several constructs in Pascal were removed from Concurrent Pascal for simplicity and security: *Variant records *Goto statement, and labels *Procedures as parameters *Packed arrays *Pointer types *File types, and associated standard input/output procedures These omissions make it possible to guarantee, by a combination of compile-time checks and minimal run-time checking in the threaded-code interpreter, that a program can not damage itself or another program by addressing outside its allotted space. Concurrent Pascal includes class, monitor, and process data types. Instances of these types are declared as variables, and initialized in an \`init\` statement. Classes and monitors are similar: both package private variables and procedures with public procedures (called procedure entries). A class instance can be used by only one process, whereas a monitor instance may be shared by processes. Monitors provide the only mechanism for interprocess communication in a Concurrent Pascal program. Only one process can execute within a given monitor instance at a time. A built in data type, the queue, together with operations \`delay\` and \`continue\`, are used for scheduling within monitors. Each variable of type queue can hold one process. If many processes are to be delayed in a monitor, multiple queue variables, usually organized as an array, must be provided. The single process queue variable gives a monitor full control over medium-term scheduling, but the programmer is responsible for unblocking the correct process. A process, like a class or monitor, has local variables, procedures, and an initial statement, but has no procedure entries. The initial statement ordinarily executes forever, calling local procedures, class procedures, and monitor procedures. Processes communicate through monitor procedures. Language rules prevent deadlock by imposing a hierarchy on monitors. But nothing can prevent a monitor from erroneously forgetting to unblock a delayed process (by not calling continue) so the system can still effectively hang up through programming errors. The configuration of processes, monitors, and classes in a Concurrent Pascal program is normally established at the start of execution, and is not changed thereafter. The communication paths between these components are established by variables passed in the \`init\` statements, since class and monitor instance variables cannot be used as procedure parameters. Example The following example shows the declaration of a simple monitor, and its use by two communicating processes. type \\"Bounded buffer monitor\\" buffer = Monitor var saved : Integer; \\"saved item is an integer\\" fullq, emptyq : Queue; \\"used by only two processes\\" full : Boolean; \\"true if an item is saved:\\" \\"Puts item in buffer\\" procedure entry put(item : Integer); begin if full then delay(fullq); \\"block if full\\" saved := item; \\"save the item\\" full := true; \\"mark as full\\" continue(emptyq) \\"unblock consumer\\" end; \\"Gets item from the buffer\\" procedure entry get(var item : Integer); begin if not full then delay(emptyq); \\"block if empty\\" item := saved; \\"get the item\\" full := false; \\"mark as not full\\" continue(fullq) \\"unblock producer\\" end; \\"Initialize the monitor\\" begin full := false end; \\"Producer uses a buffer\\" producer = process(pass : Buffer); var item : Integer; begin cycle \\"execute in a loop forever\\" \\"produce an item\\" pass.put(item) \\"pass an item to the monitor\\" end end; \\"Consumer uses a buffer\\" consumer = process(pass : Buffer); var item : Integer; begin cycle pass.get(item); \\"get an item from the monitor\\" \\"consume the item\\" end end; \\"declare instances of the monitor, producer, and consumer\\" \\"give the producer and consumer access to the monitor\\" var pass : Buffer; prod : Producer; cons : Consumer; begin init pass, \\"initialize the monitor\\" prod(pass), \\"start the producer process\\" cons(pass) \\"start the consumer process\\" end.

The filter aims to improve the appearance of decoded pictures. It is a part of the specification for both the SMPTE VC-1 codec and the ITU H.264 (ISO MPEG-4 AVC) codec.  H.264 deblocking filter  In contrast with older MPEG-1/2/4 standards, the H.264 deblocking filter is not an optional additional feature in the decoder. It is a feature on both the decoding path and on the encoding path, so that the in-loop effects of the filter are taken into account in reference macroblocks used for prediction. When a stream is encoded, the filter strength can be selected, or the filter can be switched off entirely. Otherwise, the filter strength is determined by coding modes of adjacent blocks, quantization step size, and the steepness of the luminance gradient between blocks. The filter operates on the edges of each 4√ó4 or 8√ó8 transform block in the luma and chroma planes of each picture. Each small block's edge is assigned a boundary strength based on whether it is also a macroblock boundary, the coding (intra/inter) of the blocks, whether references (in motion prediction and reference frame choice) differ, and whether it is a luma or chroma edge. Stronger levels of filtering are assigned by this scheme where there is likely to be more distortion. The filter can modify as many as three samples on either side of a given block edge (in the case where an edge is a luma edge that lies between different macroblocks and at least one of them is intra coded). In most cases it can modify one or two samples on either side of the edge (depending on the quantization step size, the tuning of the filter strength by the encoder, the result of an edge detection test, and other factors).  H.263 Annex J deblocking filter  Although the concept of an \\"in loop\\" deblocking filter is best known in relation to H.264, it was actually also standardized earlier (in a somewhat different form) in the H.263v2 Annex J.  Deblocking filters as post-processors  Prior to H.263 Annex J and H.264, the use of a deblocking filter as a post-processing technique to improve the visual quality of decoded pictures was already a well-known technology. This was particularly true in the video conferencing industry, where the low bit rates used tended to produce significant blocking artifacts that could be substantially reduced by such a filter.

Bo Yikao is the oldest and most outstanding son of Ji Chang, the \\"Duke of the West\\" of the Shang dynasty. He is well versed in music and the arts, handsome, and filial. The book recounts the story of Chang's imprisonment at Youli and (ahistorically) credits Yikao with bringing the bribes to free him. At his audience, King Zhou's concubine Daji finds Yikao attractive and has the king employ him to teach her how to play the zither. During a lesson, Daji attempts to seduce the boy but he rejects and ridicules her. Daji's infatuation turns to hatred: she complains to the king that Yikao molested her and insulted the king in his music. King Zhou is furious and he orders Yikao to be executed, minced into pieces, and made into meat cakes. The king then sends the cakes to Ji Chang. Ji Chang's mastery of divination means he has already foreseen his son's fate but, in order not to arouse the king's suspicion, he hides his sorrow and gleefully consumes the cakes. Thinking his divination incompetent, the king then allows the duke to leave. On the way home, the grieving Ji Chang vomits out the meat, which transforms into three white rabbits that are later brought under the care of the moon goddess Chang'e. The horrible death of Bo Yikao has solidified the will of the Zhou people to rebel and overthrow the tyrannical King Zhou. Four years after the death of Ji Chang, Bo Yikao's younger brother Ji Fa rises up and defeated King Zhou at the Battle of Muye and establishing the Zhou dynasty. Bo Yikao's soul is assigned by Jiang Ziya as the Zi Wei Emperor, who rules over the North Pole.

It was founded during the course of the 14th century by Dutch merchants, who at that time belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of the 15th century, it became the national church of the whole Holy Roman Empire in Rome and henceforth the so-called German national church and hospice of German- speaking people in Rome. According to tradition, the church received its name, from the picture of Our Lady which forms its coat of arms (the Blessed Virgin between two souls). Among the artworks housed inside is the Holy Family by Giulio Romano. It is the resting place of the Dutch Pope Adrian VI as well as of Cardinals William of Enckenvoirt and Andrew of Austria. History=14th and 15th century Santa Maria dell'Anima is one of the many medieval charity institutions built for pilgrims in Rome. The church found its origin in 1350, when Johannes (Jan) and Katharina Peters of Dordrecht bought three houses and turned it into a private hospice for pilgrims, at the occasion of the Jubilee of 1350. Jan Peters may have been a Dutch merchant or papal soldier; Dordrecht belonged to a region which later became independent as the Netherlands. They named the hospice \\"Beatae Mariae Animarum\\" (\\"Blessed Mary's of the Souls\\"). It was erected on its present site in 1386. In the 15th century Santa Maria dell'Anima expanded to be a hostel for visitors from the entire Holy Roman Empire, though initially the occupants were primarily from the Low Countries and (from the middle 15th century) the Rhineland. The foundation of the hospice was confirmed by the bull of Pope Boniface IX on 9 November 1399, which granted it indulgences. In 1406, it was raised to the rank of a national institution and united with a Brotherhood governed by Provisors and a Congregation. On 21 May 1406 Pope Innocent VII in his bull Piae Postulatio declared the hospice exempt from all but papal jurisdiction, and took it under his immediate protection. In 1418, it was greatly enriched by the legacy of its second founder, Diedrich of Niem. The Popes of the fifteenth century, with the exception of Pope Sixtus IV, showed it great favor. In 1431 a church was built on the place of the hospice's chapel (consecrated by Pope Eugene IV in 1444) and the community was united with the German hospice of St. Andrew which had been founded in 1372 by the priest Nicholas of Kulm. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Santa Maria dell'Anima became the national and religious centre as well as burial place in Rome of the Holy Roman Empire. 16th-17th century Johann Burchard from Strasbourg joined the Confraternity of Santa Maria dell'Anima and rose to be its provost at the end of the 15th century. While he held this office, the decision was made to rebuild the church for the Jubilee of 1500. The present church which owes its Renaissance style to the influence of Bramante, was built by German subscriptions, between 1499 and 1522. It stands on the site of the older church, built between 1431 and 1499, and was decorated by the great artists of the period. The church was built in the style of a hall church that was typical for Northern Europe, but which sits awkwardly amid the Italianate churches of Rome. Andrea Sansovino was retained as architect. The facade was completed by Giuliano da Sangallo. The new church was consecrated only on 25 November 1542. Roman sarcophagus in the courtyard. 18th-20th century During the Napoleonic occupation, the church was plundered and the sacristy used as a horse stable. In 1844, the (new) Belgian community moved to the Church of St. Julian of the Flemings. Under the influence of the era's nationalism, in 1859 the Confraternity was transformed to a German seminary and renamed the Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell'Anima, which later served as a Ratline to aid Nazi war criminals such as Gustav Wagner and Franz Stangl in their flight from justice. Dutch Catholics retained the Anima as their national church, but after extended conflicts left it in 1939 (since 1992 the San Michele dei Frisoni near the Vatican has taken that role). Tomb of Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt The inscriptions found in Santa Maria dell'Anima, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V.

During the Second Vatican Council, Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, attempted to find lodging at the German pilgrim hostel at Santa Maria Dell'Anima, but was turned away due to no vacancy. Instead, he found lodging at the temporary priest residence across the street. Personal testimony of Sister Maria Chiara, former caretaker of the hostel. Interior Funeral monument of Pope Adrian VI Among the artistic treasures of the church are (in chronological order): * A altarpiece painted by Giulio Romano in 1521-22 for a Fugger family, depicting the Sacred Family and donors (Mark and Giacomo Fugger). * The funerary monument of Pope Adrian VI (r. 1521‚Äì1523), commissioned by his friend, cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt and designed in part by Baldassarre Peruzzi. * An altarpiece (1532) by Lorenzetto. * The funerary monument of Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt (1464‚Äì1534), bishop of Tortosa (1522‚Äì1534) and of Utrecht (1529‚Äì1534). The monument by Giovanni Mangone was originally located next to Adrian's monument, but was moved to near the main entrance in 1575. * A Deposition (1550) by Francesco Salviati * A painting by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta. * The funerary monument of Andrew of Austria (1558‚Äì1600), cardinal since 1573 * Miracles of Saint Benno and Martyrdom of Saint Lambert (1618) painted by Carlo Saraceni.

Programs included Sydney Leadership, Queensland Leadership and a four- day Introduction to Adaptive Leadership. They worked directly with organisations to develop and deliver customised programs to build internal leadership capacity. All programs were based on an Adaptive Leadership approach developed by Professor Ron Heifetz at Harvard University (Source: https://www.toolshero.com/leadership/adaptive-leadership). The Benevolent Society made the difficult decision to close SLA in 2017 as a result of the evolution of the market and the proliferation of leadership programs available.

The United States established a presence at the turn of the century.  The Americans first come to Angeles  1941: Clark Field in Angeles, Pampanga looking westward. In the upper left center, abutting the foothills of the Zambales Mountains, lies Fort Stotsenburg. The rectangular, tree-lined area is the parade ground. In the late 19th century, a British company working under contract to the colonial Spanish administration, had completed the Manila‚ÄìDagupan Railroad and at the time of America's victory over the Spanish, this still represented the best means of transportation in Luzon. Following the incidents that led to the beginning of US‚ÄìPhilippine hostilities and Emilio Aguinaldo's withdrawal to the north from Manila, the American forces attempted to seize control of this valuable line of communication. The Philippine Army, numbering about 15,000, was just as determined to defend this vital link, and during 1899, fought a series of unsuccessful battles with US forces. On 17 March 1899, General Aguinaldo moved the seat of his government from Nueva Ecija to the town of Angeles, which lay astride the Manila-Dagupan Railroad, and there celebrated the first anniversary of the Philippine Republic, on 12 June 1899. The Republican government remained hard-pressed by the American advance, and in July, Aguinaldo moved his government again, this time, to the town of Tarlac, further to the north. The battle for Angeles began on 13 August 1899 and lasted for three days. Opposing the U.S. Army's VIII Corps, commanded by Major General Arthur MacArthur, were Philippine forces under the command of Brigadier General Maximino Hizon, Servillano Aquino, Pio del Pilar, Venancio Concepcion, and Tomas Mascardo. The fighting was fierce and bloody and even though Colonel Alberto San Miguel and a General Makabulos brought fresh reinforcements, the Filipinos finally had to withdraw. They took up positions on the Mabalacat side of the Abacan River and remained there until 5 November, when American cavalry flanking movements rendered these positions untenable. After a final day-long bloody engagement on the 5th, Filipino forces withdrew to the north. Meanwhile, American forces already had taken possession of Angeles. Initially, the American occupation of Angeles was considered temporary, and the troops lived in tents, temporary shelters, or within the town itself. From mid-August until the final action on 5 November 1899, war- time conditions existed because Aguinaldo's rear guard forces held positions just across the Abacan River.  Fort Stotsenburg  :See Fort Stotsenburg  Beginnings: the 1910s  American air power in the Western Pacific began in March 1912 when Lieutenant Frank Lahm established the Philippine Air School with one aircraft. Five years later, construction of the first five of eight hangars would begin. The final three hangars would be completed by the 3d Aero Squadron, U.S. Army, in 1919. This squadron was Clark Field's first aviation unit. Men of the squadron began the grueling work of building the first runway at Fort Stotsenburg in 1919. This airfield would be named after Major Harold M. Clark; when completed Clark Field became the only American airdrome west of Hawaii. A DeHavilland DH-4 at Clark Field The DeHavilland DH-4 became the first U.S. Army airplane to be deployed at Clark Field, arriving in 1919. This DH-4 was flown by Major Roy Brown, Commander of the 3d Aero Squadron, and, as was the custom of the day, bore his personal insignia. The fledgling U.S. Army Air Corps was forced to use a variety of aircraft from different sources to keep its units up to strength. Around 1920, World War I SPAD S.VIIs of French manufacture were deployed to Clark Field.  Housing on base  The first airmen at Clark Field constructed their \\"dormitories\\" in September 1919. The 20-man tents were put up under a canopy of cogon grass, which cooled the interiors. By 1920, a 200-bed capacity single enlisted quarters with natural air-conditioning provided by large, unscreened windows had replaced the 3d Aero Squadron's original tents. After the establishment of Clark Field, new family and bachelor officers quarters were needed. In 1920, construction of eight \\"barns\\" were completed near what is now the intersection of Dau Avenue and Marrat Highway.  The 1920s  Clark Field in 1925 By the mid-1920s, the initial stages of construction at Clark had been completed such as aircraft hangars and support buildings. Also completed by this time are enlisted barracks, a bachelor officers quarters, and eight \\"barns\\" along what is now Marratt Highway. It was in the 1920s that the Martin MB-2 biplane was introduced and subsequently extensively used for Clark Field operations. The U.S. Army Air Service contingent in the Philippines consisted of the 28th Bombardment and 3rd Pursuit Squadrons, forming the 4th Composite Group. Generals Billy Mitchell (L) and Emilio Aguinaldo (in white). During this decade, General Aguinaldo would also have the opportunity to visit Fort Stotsenburg and Clark Airfield. Having served in the Philippines during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, General Billy Mitchell revisited Fort Stotsenburg in 1924 during a 9-month survey of the Pacific aerial defenses. During this visit, Mitchell gave a flying lesson to the leader of the Philippine Revolution, General Emilio Aguinaldo, whom he had helped capture. In the 1920s the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Field Artillery Regiment was activated and regularly went to Camp O'Donnell for target practice or to Lingayen, Pangasinan for maneuvers with all U.S. forces based on Luzon. This regiment was composed of Philippine Scouts who were led by officers derived from the Regular Army or from the ranks of Filipino officers who had attended West Point.  The 1930s  Clark Field in 1938 Martin B-10s were stationed at Clark Field with the 28th Bombardment Squadron in the late 1930s. When the 28th received new B-17s, three of these very outmoded B-10s were transferred to the Philippine Army Air Corps.  World War II: the 1940s = Japanese attack  On 8 December 1941, General Douglas MacArthur, who recently had been called back to active service and placed in command of all U.S. and Philippine forces, had known of the attack on Pearl Harbor since about five in the morning, but insisted on delaying any hostile act by the forces under his command until the Japanese committed an overt attack on the Philippines, this was in accordance to instructions received from General George Marshall in Washington. It is also likely that MacArthur was influenced by his close friend Philippine President Manuel Quezon, who wanted the Philippines to remain neutral and thus be spared Japanese attack. Major General Lewis H. Brereton, Far East Air Force Commander, met with Major General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's Chief of Staff, and argued in vain that his bombers at Clark should be allowed to strike military targets on Taiwan, the location from which everyone felt the Japanese attack would come. Meanwhile, the B-17s at Clark were loaded first with anti-ship ordnance. Later, that order was rescinded and different bombs were uploaded for use against Japanese airfields on Taiwan. Eventually, Brereton got permission to send one B-17 on a reconnaissance mission to the north. When the attack on Clark Field came, maintenance crews were in the process of preparing the one reconnaissance plane, changing the bomb loads in the other B-17s, and refueling the fighters, which had just come in from patrol. The aircrews were eating lunch. They were sitting ducks. On 8 December 1941, the US Far East Air Force consisted of the 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) under Colonel Eugene L. Eubank at Clark and the 24th Pursuit Group under Colonel Orrin L. Glover, also at Clark. The 19th had * 3 B-17s assigned and consisted of the 28th and 30th Squadrons (8 B-17s and 2 B-18s) at Del Monte Field on Mindanao, a total of 13 craft * the 24th Pursuit Group with its outmoded 18 P-35s was at nearby Del Carmen Field, now Basa Air Base, 18 craft * the 24th Group consisted of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (18 P-40Es) at Iba and the 17th and 21st Squadrons, with 18 P-40Es each, at Nichols Field, Manila, now Villamor Air Base, a total of 54 craft * the 2nd Observation Squadron also had O-46 and O-52 aircraft at Clark * Philippine Army Air Corps assets were old and few: 42 PT-13 trainers, 12 P-26 fighters, and three B-10s, a total of 57 craft. The total number of available military airplanes at that moment was over 142 aircraft (not counting the O-46s and O-52s). Within a few hours, despite heroic efforts, almost all of these aircraft, with the exception of the ones deployed to Mindanao, were gone. Major Boyd D. WagnerCaptain Boyd Wagner, a native of Nanty Glo, Pennsylvania, was Commander of the 17th Pursuit Squadron on 8 December 1941, when the Japanese attacked Clark Field, and became one of the first American pilots to engage the enemy in the air. Later in the month, he became the first American World War II ace when he downed his fifth Japanese aircraft. Wagner High School and Wagner Middle School were named for Captain Wagner, who offered Americans a rare \\"bright\\" spot in the otherwise bleak news they were receiving about the defense of the Philippines. Following the Japanese air attacks on Clark Field and other military areas in the Philippines on 8 December 1941, and the subsequent landing of Japanese ground forces on Luzon, General Douglas MacArthur activated War Plan Orange. This plan called for the gradual withdrawal of American and Philippine forces south past several defensive positions (one of which ran through Tarlac, just north of Clark) to the Bataan Peninsula, where they could await reinforcements from Hawaii and the U.S. The defense of Bataan in the face of vastly overwhelming numbers and terrible battle conditions proved beyond a doubt the capabilities of the untested Allied forces. At one point during this period in early 1942, Philippine Brigadier General Vicente Lim established his headquarters in a pigpen. After the collapse of American/Filipino defense lines on Bataan and the decisions to declare Manila an open city to end the defense of Corregidor, American and Filipino prisoners of war were marched at gunpoint back up the Bataan Peninsula to San Fernando, Pampanga, about 11 miles south of Fort Stotsenburg. Here, they were jammed into railroad box cars and taken to Camp O'Donnell, near Capas, Tarlac, about 15 miles north of Fort Stotsenburg. = Bataan Death March = Thousands of Filipino soldiers and hundreds of American soldiers died of their wounds on the infamous Bataan Death March. Others were brutally murdered by Japanese troops when they could not keep up with the pace. The men of the Bataan Death March passed by the main gate of Clark Air Base, as the soldiers followed the direction of the railway tracks north. Later, following their initial incarceration at Camp O'Donnell, most American POWs were moved to Cabanatuan, while their Filipino comrades remained at Camp O'Donnell. Some of the American prisoners who were interned at Camp O'Donnell were sent to Fort Stotsenburg and were forced to perform menial labor for their Japanese conquerors. These prisoners were considered the lucky ones as the others who remained in O'Donnell or Cabanatuan were moved aboard freighters to Japanese slave labor camps in the home islands. The Japanese refused to mark these vessels with the appropriate insignia, and many of them fell victim to American submarines, whose crews had no idea that the enemy ships they sent to the bottom carried fellow Americans aboard. (See also Hell ships). From 1903 to 1942, the American forces used Lily Hill primarily as an observation point and the Japanese followed suit when they occupied Clark. During the American attack on Clark, tunnels were dug beneath its surface and it was from this point that the Japanese made their final defense. After World War II, the USAF established it first aircraft warning and control unit which remained on its summit, until relocated to Wallace Air Station at Poro Point on the Lingayen Gulf coast in December 1962. In 1955, the underbrush on Lily Hill was burned back, revealing the remains of two Japanese aircraft and many smaller artifacts attesting to Japan's strong defense of Clark.  Birthplace of the Kamikaze  A marker, naming the birthplace of the Kamikaze is located north of the town of Mabalacat on MacArthur Highway, along Clark's eastern perimeter. During the war, the American liberators thought that these suicide planes were flying from Northern Luzon, but in their postwar interrogations, Japanese airmen insisted that the attacks had originated at Clark Field. This fact subsequently was confirmed: two Kamikaze pilots had flown circuitous routes to avoid U.S. fighter patrols, and thus had left the impression that the attacks came from Northern Luzon. During the course of the American liberation of the Philippines, the Japanese conducted extensive counter air operations from Clark Field. Japanese Kamikaze pilots also operated from an airstrip just north of Clark, near Mabalacat, Pampanga, against allied shipping. During the liberation of the Philippines, Americans extensively bombed Clark, thus, for the second time in only a few years, the base came under heavy attack. Post-war investigations revealed that from the beginning of Allied air attacks on Clark, Nichols, and Nielson fields in October 1944 until February 1945, 1,505 Japanese aircraft were put out of action on the ground. At Clark, the heavy bomber attacks had caused the Japanese to disperse repair shops, storage areas, and maintenance units, scattering them as far as Bamban. Sometimes, parts were hidden or even buried, often becoming inaccessible later. One captured Japanese aircraft needed only one of the carburetors buried at Mabalacat to be ready for flight. In fact, when Allied troops captured Mabalacat, they found over 200 aircraft engines, some of which had never been uncrated.  201st Fighter Squadron, Fuerza A√©rea Expedicion√°ria Mexicana  P-47D using both USAAF and FAM insignia (right wing and tail) During World War II, the U.S. Army Air Corps undertook the training of several contingents of personnel from many Central and South American nations. Brazil provided the largest of these contingents, with Mexico in second place. The P-47 Thunderbolt-equipped 201st Fighter Squadron of the Fuerza A√©rea Expedicion√°ria Mexicana arrived in the Philippines in early 1945 and participated in the Luzon Campaign, as well as in subsequent operations against Formosa.http://erickr0.tripod.com/201st Mexican Fighter Squadron  Sneak attacks and Japanese defense of Clark  A memorial to the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts) of the United States Army, in front of the headquarters of the Thirteenth Air ForceFollowing the 8 December 1941 air attack on Clark Field and MacArthur's decision to fall back on Bataan, American forces abandoned Fort Stotsenburg. Thus, except for the airdrome itself, the base was spared the ravages of war. When the American counterattack on Stotsenburg began in late 1944, the Japanese made the decision to defend the base at all costs. From beginning to end, the defense lasted more than a month, and even after the base itself had been captured, hold out Japanese troops remained in the foothills of the Zambales Mountains and had to be flushed out one by one. Damage to base facilities was extensive.  Reconstruction: late-1940s and 1950s  Post World War II, Clark Field saw a building boom, with barracks, operations, and storage buildings being constructed at a breakneck pace. Constructed during this period were \\"liberation barracks\\", which housed enlisted men, a base operations building, a post office building, an outdoor movie theater, the NCO Open Mess, and the Clark AB golf course, once one of the finest golf courses on any U.S. military installation in the world, and the renovation of the Officers' Restaurant and the Clark Air Base Officers' Open Mess (CABOOM). Religious facilities would also be constructed. The Little Pentagon at Clark Air BaseClark's Base Headquarters was nicknamed \\"The Little Pentagon\\" because it consisted of five long quonset huts radiating out from a central area. It was built on Henry Avenue at the east end of the Parade Ground in 1947 as administrative offices on the site of the original 217-bed Post Hospital, which dated back to September 1903. Behind the hospital was an open field used for horse grazing, troop drills, and cavalry practice. Old houses still in the area were used as doctors' quarters. On the site of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company office, were the nurses' quarters. During the Japanese occupation, the old hospital was used both as a dispensary and barracks. Soldiers heated water for bathing in the big steel drums directly in front of the building. Doctors and their families occupied the barns that clustered around the hospital. With the adoption of the 1979 amended Military Bases Agreement and the establishment of Philippine sovereignty over Clark AB, Base Headquarters was moved to the Clark Air Base Compound Building at the intersection of Bong and Dyess Highways. In 1986, workers began demolishing the Pentagon to make for a new Combat Support Group Headquarters Building. At the end of World War II, Clark Field, like so many other American bases in the Western Pacific, became a dumping ground for battle-damaged equipment. Clark was a major dumping ground for P-38 \\"Lightnings\\", the mainstay of the Allied air forces in the Pacific. After being stripped of all usable material, these aircraft were simply pushed into giant pits and covered with dirt. Such \\"boneyards\\" exist at several locations on Clark and occasionally, new construction efforts result in the rediscovery of one or more of these almost completely decomposed aircraft and equipment. Although the Sixth Army's 37th Infantry Division declared that Clark Field and Fort Stotsenburg had been \\"liberated\\" on 31 January 1945, remnants of Japanese forces hiding in the Zambales foothills west of the field could still do some damage.  From the Army to the Air Force  A Boeing B-29 Superfortress undergoing maintenance at Clark FieldClark Field remained an Army Air Base until May 1949, when its facilities were transferred to the U.S. Air Force. Prior to this a build-up of aircraft, air wings and maintenance facilities were already being staged at Clark. On 14 August 1948, the 18th Fighter Wing was organized at Clark. In the early 1950s a larger, more modern facility located along O'Leary Avenue, near its intersection with Dyess Highway, was constructed to house the Clark Base Exchange. This structure last housed the Philippine Area Exchange Arcade, a conglomeration of conessionaire businesses. The Silver Wing Recreation Center, constructed in 1949, provides a host of activities for assigned personnel and their dependents, including tours, musical instruction, chess, card, and billiard tournaments. The base telegraph office also occupied space in this large building. Named for Lieutenant Colin P. Kelly, a B-17 pilot who was killed in action against the Japanese during the air defense of the Philippines, this theater opened in 1953. It served as one of the two auditoria/theaters on Clark, with the other being the Bobbitt theater near the Main Base Exchange. Kelly Theater was located just off Dau Avenue, adjacent to the Kelly Cafeteria. The Airmen's Open mess was established in Building 5721 on Bong Highway in 1954. Initially known as the \\"Lower 4 Club\\" (referring to the rank), this facility later received the name Coconut Grove. This large stadium, which is to the southwest of the \\"main base\\", was completed in 1955. The bowl originally was named Sebille Stadium in honor of Major Louis J. Sebille, a Medal of Honor recipient, who was killed in action in Korea on 5 August 1950. Since the designation was never made official, the facility was later renamed. While it has played host to numerous sporting and entertainment events, the Bamboo Bowl's \\"shining hour\\" came in the spring of 1975, when it and its grounds served as the site for the massive tent city that supported Operations \\"New Life\\" and \\"Babylift.\\" In 1986, to honor the memory of the seven astronauts who perished aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger, the stadium was renamed \\"Challenger Field.\\" 2011 photo of existing Clark Veterans Cemetery with Mt. Arayat visible in the background  Clark Veterans Cemetery  A cemetery for American veterans and Filipino workers was established near the front gate of Clark Base in 1900. The cemetery is undergoing restoration and remains active. Vietnam War era Clark Air Base in 1967, looking west from the control tower. In 1960, the USAF began construction of a new modern Regional Medical Facility at Clark. The new 200-bed Clark AB Hospital/Regional Medical Center was completed in April 1964 at a cost of $4.5 million. The new hospital occupied the same site (off Dyess Highway near its intersection with O'Leary Avenue) that had been in use for this purpose for some time. The original Fort Stotsenburg hospital had been located at the east end of the Parade Ground, on the site now occupied by the Headquarters Building for the 3d Combat Support Group. There has been much speculation regarding paranormal activity at this site, spurred on partially by an appearance in the SyFy reality series \\"Ghost Hunters\\". As the U.S. became more deeply involved in the war in Southeast Asia, Clark's role as a supporting base became more important and more people were assigned than could be housed in existing permanent quarters. Even new dormitories proved insufficient to meet the influx and so \\"temporary\\" housing once again came to Clark. Prior to the construction of this facility in 1966, transient officers were billeted in quonset huts in the library area and Bachelor Officers Quarters were located in the Hill area. Chambers Hall, which was named for Captain Samuel \\"Bud\\" P. Chambers III, who was killed in action while making an approach to Tan Son Nhut, Vietnam, on 29 June 1965, is located on Bong Highway, just to the west of the Base Library and to the north of the Parade Ground. It contains 30 apartments for bachelor officers and 294 rooms for transients. As large as this facility is, during Thirteenth Air Force operations, such as its periodic Cope Thunder training exercises, many transients have to be billeted in contracted hotels off-base. The nerve center for Clark's flying operations was the Base Operations Building. This was opened in 1968 and replaced an earlier structure located in the same area. The new building contained a cafeteria, barber shop, dispatch counter, weather office, and a secure command center. Meanwhile, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing (which had previously been at Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam) moved to Clark Air Base on 16 September 1974 and became the base's host unit, replacing the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing. The 3d Tactical Fighter Wing had inherited the lineage and honors of the 3d Bomb Group, formed in July 1919, when that unit was inactivated. One of its squadrons, the 3d Tactical Fighter Squadron, was the first to be assigned to Clark during the interwar years as the 3d Aero Squadron and later the 3d Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor). The 3d Pursuit participated in the vain attempt to defend against the Japanese air attacks of 8 December 1941, accounting for almost all of the enemy aircraft downed by American fighter planes during that engagement.  Confrontation  Following several late-night violent attacks against American personnel by Filipino citizens during the late summer of 1968, the Base Commander, Colonel Ernest P. Pate established a curfew. The city government of Angeles City retaliated by declaring the entire city off-limits to U.S. personnel, and the situation deteriorated from there. The events culminated in a series of demonstrations against the base by Filipino nationals, with the major outburst occurring on 4 October 1968. This confrontation marked the high-tide of feelings on both sides and relations quickly returned to normal. Clark Air Base in the 1970s  Operation Homecoming  Shortly after his election as U.S. President in 1968, Richard M. Nixon began the long process of negotiating an end to the conflict in Southeast Asia. At the same time, the number of American forces in SEA was gradually reduced in favor of what came to be known as Vietnamization of that conflict. Under the Nixon Doctrine, the U.S. continued to provide diplomatic, financial, and logistical support to Southeast Asian non-communist governments, but to lessen correspondingly the active roles of its own armed forces in those nations. One of the most pressing U.S. demands was for a full North Vietnamese release of American POWs and an accurate accounting of U.S. servicemen missing or killed in action. Late in 1972, a basic North Vietnamese/American agreement was reached and planning for the repatriation of U.S. POWs initiated. As the major staging base for the American involvement in SEA, Clark Air Base was designated as the initial point to which the POWs could return from Hanoi. The first group of returnees from Vietnam arrived at Clark at approximately 1615 hours, 12 February 1973. On hand to greet them at planeside were Admiral Noel Gayler, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Command; Lieutenant General William G. Moore, Thirteenth Air Force Commander; and Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Homer E. Henderson, Joint Information Bureau Assistant Non-commissioned Officer-in-Charge. On 6 April 1975, the Clark Air Base Peace Garden was dedicated to the memory of those who died or were declared \\"missing in action\\" in Southeast Asia.  Operation Babylift/New Life  The Clark AB Tent City in 1975Two years after the ending of America's ground combat role in Southeast Asia and the repatriation of its POWs from North Vietnamese concentration camps, the Communist forces in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia began to score a stunning series of victories. American response was speedy and typical: a massive evacuation of Vietnamese orphan children that came to be known as Operation Babylift. This humanitarian effort suffered a major setback on 4 April 1975, when the initial C-5A Galaxy carrying evacuees crashed shortly after taking off from Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base, killing 98 children, 46 escorts, and 11 USAF crewmembers. \\"Babylift\\" continued despite this incident, however, and as the Communist forces continued their string of successes, it expanded to cover the evacuation of adult refugees from Saigon, Phnom Penh, and Vientiane, as well. By this time, the operation's nickname had changed to \\"New Life\\", from 21 to 28 April 1975, more than 2,000 people were housed in a massive tent city, adjacent to the \\"Bamboo Bowl\\" stadium. The first planeload of Vietnamese orphans arrived at Clark on 5 April 1975.  Clark becomes a Philippine base  Foreign Minister of the Philippines, Carlos P. Romulo; Ambassador Richard W. Murphy; Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos; Imelda Marcos; and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David C. Jones From 1902 to 1979, Fort Stotsenburg/Clark AB remained U.S. possessions, guaranteed by the Military Bases Agreement (MBA) signed by the U.S. and the Republic of the Philippines on 14 March 1947. During 1978, following negotiations that had lasted on and off since the early 1970s, the two governments agreed to establish Philippine sovereignty over former American bases in the country and thus the Clark Air Base Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines came into being, following the signing of a revised MBA on 7 January 1979. To commemorate this event, the Philippine government constructed an arch based upon the design of a typical native Salakot hat. This structure was erected just in front of the Main Gate on Mitchell Highway, between the base proper and Angeles City and soon became a widely recognized symbol of this new spirit in the long tradition of Philippine-American relations. One of the most significant developments in Philippine-American relations was the promulgation of the revised 1979 MBA that, for the first time on over 75 years, established Philippine sovereignty over former U.S. Bases in the country. To facilitate its management of base areas outside of those specifically designated as part of the U.S. facility and to supervise perimeter and gate security, the AFP established Clark Air Base Command (CABCOM) on 16 February 1979, and assigned Brigadier General Oscar M. Alejandro as its first Deputy Commander. (Under Philippine regulations, the AFP Chief of Staff served as CABCOM Commander.) By the end of 1983, CABCOM had over 700 personnel assigned, serving in administrative and security posts.  In the midst of a revolution: the 1980s = Live television broadcasts from the United States The last day of 1983 saw the beginning of a new era at Clark Air Base with the transmission of live television broadcasts from the United States through the Satellite Earth Terminal. With the \\"SATNET\\", Far East Network-Philippines was able to bring timely information, news and entertainment programs to the Clark area.  The February 1986 Revolution  On 24 February, Philippine Air Force aircraft from the rebel 15th Strike Wing requested permission to land. Their original intent had been to land, refuel and rearm, but the U.S. policy of strict neutrality forbade this. Instead, Washington allowed any aircraft declaring an \\"emergency\\" to land for \\"humanitarian\\" reasons. By the time the revolution ended, Clark had become \\"safe haven\\" for a large segment of the PAF: six T-28s, five T-33s, seven F-8s, two F-47s, two C-130s, one MD-500, and two Twin Otters. The presence of these aircraft caused another problem: if the loyalist forces realized they were present, they might have tried to destroy them from the air or in a ground attack. No such threat materialized but, USAF forces at Kadena Air Base and United States Navy aircraft were ready to support Clark if it became necessary. Chambers Hall, where some of the Marcos entourage were billeted Clark's most significant role was the evacuation of President Marcos, his immediate family, and several advisors and confidants, including General Fabian Ver and Eduardo Cojuangco. By 25 February 1986, most of the AFP had switched to the rebel side and loyalist forces from northern Luzon, under Brigadier General Tomas Dumpit, who supposedly were on their way to attack Enrile and Ramos never materialized. President Ronald Reagan clearly had thrown his support to Aquino and the best that could be hoped for was to beat a safe retreat. Both U.S. Ambassador Steven Bosworth and Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group Brigadier General Theodore Allen were in communication with Malaca√±ang and Clark, as well as Washington. Later in the afternoon of the 25th, the decision was made to evacuate Marcos from the palace. Helicopters from Clark's 31st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron flew to Manila, picked up the Presidential party, and returned to the base, arriving just after 9 p.m. The ex-President, his wife and immediate family, along with General Ver, occupied 13AF Distinguished Visitor quarters, while the rest of the entourage had to be billeted in Chambers Hall. Along with the Marcos party, Clark AB personnel packaged up and sent out a considerable amount of \\"personal effects\\", the same ones that later were seized by U.S. Customs officials in Hawaii and which became the subject of so much media controversy. After spending the night on-base, the group, now swelled by several family members of sides and associates who had arrived during the night, boarded a C-9A Nightingale and a C-141 Starlifter and flew to Guam and then Hawaii, where President Marcos went into exile.  New construction  For many years, the base had languished in the backwaters of PACAF's military construction program, but that ended in the early 1980s, and since that time, the base witnessed the opening of several new facilities. One of the first of these new facilities, a modern Youth Center, first opened its doors on 29 March 1984. The old Youth Center, which had been housed in the original Kelly Theater, became a skating rink. This new Youth Center building houses a number of features designed to appeal to the younger members of Clark's community: an airconditioned basketball court, large screen television, disco, pool and ping-pong tables, video games, and a snack bar. The new Base CommissaryA new Base Commissary was opened in April 1984. Initially begun in 1980, this facility, which contained state-of-the-art equipment and marketing concepts, cost a total of $6.2 million and at the time of its commissioning, was the largest in the world. The new Commissary was located on Dyess Highway, almost next door to the old one and adjacent to the old NCO club. One of the most long-awaited and most beautiful examples of Clark's new construction boom was the Golf Club House, which was officially opened in August 1985. This modern building offers the facilities one would expect to find in a club house, as well as a pro shop, a restaurant, and a beautiful panoramic view of the course. The site of this new building was once part of the old Fort Stotsenburg cemetery, and during the digging for its foundation, several old iron crosses were uncovered. Time and the elements combined to reduce most of these to rust, but one was still in remarkably good condition and has been preserved for display in the Clark Historical Center.  Closure  The base flightline, as taken in 1990With the end of the Cold War, operations at the base were scaled back with many of the men and equipment moving to other bases, including returning to the U.S. In 1990, the last combat aircraft, a squadron of F-4 fighter-bombers, were transferred to Alaska. On 10 June 1991, two days before Mount Pinatubo began the summer-long series of eruptions, Clark Air Base was completely evacuated of all but mission essential personnel. In July 1991, the U.S. and Philippine government agreed to a new treaty regarding the lease of the Subic Bay Naval Base, Clark, and several other U.S. military installations in the Philippines. Under the agreement, the U.S. was to clean up Clark and turn the base over to the Philippine government in 1992 while leasing Subic Bay for another 10 years. The Philippine Senate rejected this extension of the Military Bases Agreement in 16 September 1991. On 26 November 1991, the U.S. government formally turned Clark over to the Philippine government, which transformed the airfield into the Clark International Airport. Reopening In June 2012, following actions from Chinese claims on the West Philippine Sea, the Philippine government agreed to the return of American military forces to Clark.

At this location around 65 km downstream from the Kariba Dam the river is about 400 m wide.Google Earth accessed 22 February: the bridges can be seen at decimal latitude/longitude coordinates -16.038453, 28.852057, with the north end in high definition. The bridges carry the Harare to Lusaka section of the Great North Road, which extends between South Africa and East Africa, and was once seen as part of a Cape to Cairo Road. Chirundu is the only town on the Zambezi where two bridges cross the river. The Otto Beit Bridge (1939) Otto Beit The first Chirundu Bridge is the Otto Beit Bridge built in 1938-9 by Dorman Long and financed by the Beit Trust, which funded most of central and southern Africa's colonial era bridges including the Beit Bridge across the Limpopo River, the Kafue Bridge, and the Luangwa Bridge. The Otto Beit Bridge was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.List of bridges designed by Freeman Fox & Partners and built by Redpath Dorman Long or its predecessors in the booklet \\"50th anniversary of the opening of Sydney Harbour Bridge\\" 1982. It has a span of 382 m (main span 320 m). As it was built two decades before the Kariba Dam, the engineers had to consider the annual Zambezi flood, now tamed by the dam: hence the requirement for a single span (which the second bridge did not need). It cost ¬£186,000 to build and was opened on 24 May 1939 by Lady Lillian Beit, widow of Otto Beit. The Otto Beit Bridge is a single- lane bridge, with traffic operating in alternating directions, leading to congestion. Secondly the maintenance of steel suspension bridges is considerable, with cables needing replacement when they corrode, and the age of the bridge also places restrictions on the loads it can carry. Consequently, Zambia and Zimbabwe identified the need for a second bridge. Second Chirundu Bridge (2002) The second Chirundu Bridge was built by the Kajima Corporation in 2000‚Äì2002 and opened on 12 December 2002. It is 90 metres upstream from the Otto Beit Bridge, using the same approaches and border control area. It is a two-lane, three-span continuous prestressed concrete box girder bridge, 400 meters long and 10.3 meters wide.Kajima Corporation News Web site accessed 22 February 2007.

The Santa Barbara News-Press controversy refers to a series of events starting after businesswoman Wendy P. McCaw bought the Santa Barbara News-Press from The New York Times Company in 2000. McCaw proceeded to oversee some of the newspaper's content, and some news editors and reporters felt her intervention compromised the paper's neutrality and credibility. The tensions came to a head on July 6, 2006, when five editors and a columnist resigned. They and three others staffers later received an \\"Ethics in Journalism\\" award from the Society of Professional Journalists, and the entire editorial staff was awarded the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism as a result of their actions in the dispute.

Ampersand also alleged misappropriation of its trade secrets by acquiring and publishing the draft and by acquiring another draft News-Press article relating to the paper's arbitration proceeding against a former editor. Ampersand also brought claims for unfair competition, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and contract, and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage and contract.Santa Barbara News-Press Press Release October 26, 2006\\"News-Press Sues the Independent,\\" Santa Barbara Independent, October 27, 2006 The Independent had posted a copy of a story written by News-Press reporter Scott Hadly about the July 6, 2006, events. The News-Press chose not to publish the story, and a copy was leaked to the Independent, which posted the article on its website. Ampersand requested the removal of the story, and the Independent complied. The October 26 suit concerned the few days when the leaked story had been posted and also identified a second unpublished News-Press story about Ampersand's suit against Roberts. In November 2007 the trial judge Edward Rafeedie granted Ampersand summary judgment on its copyright infringement claim, holding that the posting of the draft article was not fair use. The judge dismissed Ampersand's trade-secret claim. He reserved decision on the trade-secret claim relating to the arbitration article, pending resolution of Ampersand's motion to compel the writer to answer questions about his source of information. The judge also dismissed the unfair competition and tortious interference claims, stating that they were preempted by federal copyright law and the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act.Citizen Media Law Project summary Susan Paterno Ampersand filed suit on December 12, 2006, against Chapman University Professor Susan Paterno, author of the article \\"Santa Barbara Smackdown\\" that appeared in the American Journalism Review.Seema Mehta, \\"Santa Barbara newspaper owner sues over critical article,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 19, 2006, page B3.

The suit alleged 33 instances of false and misleading statements, claimed that Paterno's \\"article falsely states and implies that Ampersand is an unethical corporate entity engaged in unlawful conduct and that its product, the Santa Barbara News-Press, is a deficient product\\" and asserted that McCaw's involvement in the News-Press resulted from former editor Roberts' incompetence.

That edition of the Panther contained an in-depth article on Paterno's article and her legal troubles. The first hearing on Paterno's suit took place in April 2007, when the judge allowed limited discovery of evidence to go forward on four of the charges. Paterno filed for a writ of mandamus to prevent discovery being pursued against her on the four remaining libel charges, and in June 2008 the Court of Appeal in Santa Ana granted her the writ and ordered the case dismissed. The News-Press was compelled to pay Paterno's attorney fees.

Roberts described the article as \\"a smear\\" and said that the News-Press published the piece without a byline and without seeking a comment from him. He also demanded an immediate retraction and said he might pursue \\"massive damages.\\" The News-Press published a front-page clarification about the April 22 article on May 13, 2007. Two rewordings urged by Roberts' attorneys were printed. The first concerned use of the computer by other News-Press editors: The April 22 article stated that computer systems director Raul Gil had signed a declaration that the computer may have been used by other editors. The May 13 clarification stated specifically that Gil had concluded \\"by recollection, notes, and memory\\" that the desktop computer had been previously used by at least two other editors at the News-Press and \\"possibly an ex-business editor.\\" A second clarification concerned Roberts' interaction with Santa Barbara Police: In the April 22 article, the News-Press reported that Roberts \\"refused\\" to be interviewed by police, while the May 13 clarification stated that Roberts cooperated through his wife and attorneys. Roberts' attorney deemed the clarification inadequate.

It differs from summer squash in that it is harvested and eaten in the mature fruit stage when the seeds within have matured fully and the skin has hardened into a tough rind. At this stage, most varieties of this fruit can be stored for use during the winter. Winter squash is generally cooked before being eaten, and the skin or rind is not usually eaten as it is with summer squash. In New Zealand and Australian English, the term \\"pumpkin\\" generally refers to the broader category called \\"winter squash\\". Planting and harvesting Squash is a frost-tender plant meaning that the seeds do not germinate in cold soil. Winter squash seeds germinate best when the soil temperature is , and the warmer end of the range is optimal. It is harvested whenever the fruit has turned a deep, solid color and the skin is hard. Most winter squash is harvested in September or October in the Northern Hemisphere, before the danger of heavy frosts. Nutritional value Winter squash is a low-calorie food and a good source of complex vegetable carbohydrates and dietary fiber. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, a great source of vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber and manganese, and a good source of folate, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1 (thiamin), copper, tryptophan, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B3 (niacin) and vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid).

It is somewhat based on the novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell, though the film is set in 1813 on the Spanish-French border, rather than in 1811 on the border with Portugal. Plot While on patrol, Sharpe (Sean Bean) and his men rout some French soldiers who have raped and murdered the inhabitants of a Spanish village. Two are captured alive. Their commander, Brigadier General Loup (Oliver Cotton), attempts to bargain with Sharpe for the lives of his men, but Sharpe has them shot in front of him. Loup vows revenge as he departs. Meanwhile, Wellington (Hugh Fraser) receives unwanted reinforcements from the King of Spain. His Most Catholic Majesty sends his personal bodyguard, the Real Compania Irlandesa (Royal Irish Company), composed of poorly trained men of Irish descent under the command of the inexperienced Lord Kiely (Jason Durr). Wellington doesn't trust them, not least because of reports in American newspapers that the British are committing atrocities against the Irish people. So he orders the unreliable men to garrison a fort near the French lines, where it will be easy for them to desert if they want to. He assigns Sharpe to train them and puts him under the command of former Wagonmaster- General Colonel Runciman (Ian McNeice). Kiely's wife, Lady Kiely (Allie Byrne), and his mistress, guerrilla leader Do√±a Juanita (Siri Neal), both show up in camp. In the meantime, Sharpe has enough time to train the men and strengthen the fort's defences, so that when Loup finally attacks, he is repulsed. Afterwards, Sharpe proposes a quick surprise assault on Loup's headquarters, which is approved by Kiely, Runciman and Juanita. When Kiely learns that his wife is pregnant, he sends her away, out of harm's way, but she is captured. Juanita reveals herself to be a French agent by giving Kiely a secret ultimatum from Loup. He is to let Sharpe and his men commit themselves to the attack, then abandon them in exchange for Lady Kiely's life. It almost goes according to plan. Sharpe's men are trapped, though he himself manages to reach Kiely. When Kiely refuses to act, Sharpe fights him, only to be shot in the arm by Juanita. At that point, Kiely finally rebels. He kills Juanita and shows that she had distributed fake newspapers to undermine the Irishmen's loyalty. Together, he and Sharpe lead the attack against the French. Meanwhile, Harper, in temporary command of Sharpe's company, tricks the French by pretending to be dead. The British win the fight - although Harper is devastated by the death of his youngest rifleman, Perkins (Lyndon Davies), killed by a rebel in the Irish Company, who Harper, hungry for revenge, ultimately kills. As the battle draws to a close, Kiely is killed by Loup when he tries to free his pregnant wife. Loup is slain in turn by Sharpe. Now a widow, Lady Kiely leaves the country and the surviving Chosen Men bury Perkins next to Miranda. The riflemen salute Perkins and solemnly leave the grave. Sharpe takes one last look at Perkins' final resting place before moving on.

(), commonly known as TTV and formerly known as Central Television and Voice of Taiwan, is the first terrestrial television station in Taiwan. It was established on April 28, 1962 and started formally broadcasting later that year on October 10, 1962. The station became home to many trailblazing and innovative shows at the time. Recently, the station enjoyed a resurgence in viewership when it inked a major contract with Sanlih E-Television to promote and air the latter's shows. TTV's pop idol dramas consistently rated high, although it sometimes went down or up depending on the storyline and the stars' appeal on these dramas. Under media reform laws, TTV was tapped for privatization in 2007. Since 1962, TTV began some of the milestones that changed the landscape of TTV presenting the first Taiwanese-language TV serial as well as the first Mandarin drama anthology series. TTV presented the first costume drama serial \\"Cheng Ch'eng-kung\\" (1963) starring Ts'ao Chien as the title role. On September 7, 1969, after airing what would be one of its final major coverages, that of the Apollo XI landing in July, in monochrome, TTV transitioned to color.

Renfroe Company and were managers overseeing catastrophe claims adjusters. Kerri and Cori Rigsby are also the whistleblowers who proved to a Mississippi jury that State Farm committed fraud against the U.S. government. The sisters claim State Farm ignored or minimized wind damage to avoid payments relating to Hurricane Katrina and instead attributed damage to flooding so that the National Flood Insurance Program would cover the claims. The jury verdict was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was then affirmed 8-0 by the United States Supreme Court. The Rigsbys were managers who worked in Gulfport, Mississippi for a subcontractor hired by State Farm to adjust wind and flood claims after Hurricane Katrina. They were the first to uncover a fraudulent scheme by State Farm to improperly categorize wind damage as flood damage. This mischaracterization was very important because State Farm had to pay for wind damage out of its own pocket under State Farm homeowner policies, while flood damage was paid by the federal government under FEMA's flood policies. Over the course of several months, the sisters amassed thousands of pages of documents related to State Farm's activities. The Rigsbys' landmark win was historic because they were the first to prove that an insurance company defrauded the government in FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program despite testimony by FEMA‚Äôs Executive Director that, after investigating the allegations, he personally didn‚Äôt believe that there was any fraud by State Farm, and he confirmed that FEMA had not asked State Farm to repay any money to the National Flood Insurance Program. However, according to court documents, the sisters took the documents without authorization. Their actions in regard to these documents is the subject of ongoing legal action. Eventually, their story went public when ABC's 20/20 show aired it in August 2006. In 2008, Judge Senter of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi found that the sisters and their attorneys had acted unethically when the Scruggs Katrina Group paid the sisters $150,000 per year each to testify, and barred them from testifying or using any of the documents that were taken. Scruggs was later forced to withdraw as their attorney because he improperly paid them for downloading and giving him the State Farm claims files and other documents to use in his lawsuits against State Farm.Memorandum Opinion [Doc. 177] by U. S. District Judge L. T. Senter, Jr., in U. S. ex rel. Rigsby v. State Farm, No. 1:06cv0433 LTS- RHW (S. D. Miss. May 19, 2008) Scruggs also was later disbarred after pleading guilty to conspiracy to bribe a state circuit court judge in 2008 and separately, to improperly influence another state court circuit judge. He was sentenced to serve five years and seven years, to run concurrently, on the two guilty pleas.Lange, Alan, et al. (2009). Kings of Tort. Pediment Publishing. p. 255. FEMA's Federal Flood Program Many homeowners who live in coastal areas have two insurance policies on their homes: (1) homeowners' policies, which are underwritten by private insurers and cover damage from wind; and (2) flood policies, which are underwritten by the National Flood Insurance Program and cover damage from flooding. Private insurance companies contract with the government and are paid fees for selling the federal flood insurance policies, for collecting the premiums, and for adjusting flood claims under those policies.

Documents The sisters say they ultimately obtained about 15,000 pages of claims records. Their collection of these documents is the subject of ongoing legal action. Their former employer filed suit in Alabama asking that the court order the return of the documents. The suit claims the sisters took the documents without permission or authorization. The Rigsby sisters alleged that State Farm‚Äôs action in McIntosh was not an isolated incident, but a widespread campaign by State Farm to pressure engineers to issue certain types of reports to reduce State Farm's liability. State Farm representatives in Bloomington, IL, the home office, say what the women describe would be contrary to the company's claims practices. E. A. Renfroe E.A. Renfroe, the company that contracted with State Farm Insurance Co., sued the Rigsby sisters on September 1, 2006, asking the court to enjoin the Rigsby sisters‚Äô further use of the documents and require them to return State Farm‚Äôs documents to Renfroe.Complaint [Doc. 1] in E. A. Renfroe & Company v. Moran, Civil Action No. 06-AR-1752-S (N. D. Ala.).; Memorandum Opinion by U. S. District Judge William M. Acker, Jr., E. A. Renfroe & Company v. Moran, 508 F. Supp. 2d 986 (N. D. Ala. June 15, 2007) Renfroe alleged in its lawsuit that Cori and Kerri Rigsby broke the law when they turned over reams of internal State Farm records to their attorney, Richard Scruggs. Renfroe's lawsuit, filed in an Alabama federal court, accused the sisters of violating the Alabama Trade Secrets Act and breaching confidentiality agreements with the company. Renfroe successfully asked a judge to order the Rigsby sisters to return the documents they presented Scruggs and to bar them from continuing to disclose information. Scruggs's efforts to evade this order resulted in a charge of criminal contempt against him that was eventually dismissed. A final judgment in the case was entered in favor of Renfroe (the plaintiffs).Final Judgment [Doc. 424] by U. S. District Judge William M. Acker, Jr. dated May 1, 2009 entered in E. A. Renfroe & Company v. Moran, Civil Action No. 06-AR-1752-S (N. D. Ala.) The Rigsby sisters also sued Renfroe in their whistleblower suit against State Farm on several grounds, including unlawful retaliation for firing them, but Renfroe won on all counts against it, and was dismissed from the lawsuit before trial.Memorandum Opinion [Doc. No. 1185] by U. S. District Judge L. T. Senter, Jr. dated April 21, 2008 entered in McIntosh v. State Farm, Civil Action No. 1:06cv1080 LTS-RHW (S.D. Miss.) Court=November 2006 Attorney General Jim Hood's office argued that the Alabama suit, E.A. Renfroe & Co. Inc. v. Moran, No. 06-CV-1752, should be suspended until the Mississippi Attorney General's office completed its criminal investigation into post-Katrina insurance claims practices. They claimed the government's case could be compromised if the civil case continued. The court denied the Mississippi Attorney General‚Äôs request. Insurance Commissioner George Dale: Dale launched his own investigation of the insurance industry and began with State Farm because they were the biggest insurance company in Mississippi. Dale claimed he was spurred on by policyholder complaints aired on local television. December 2006 Federal Judge William Acker Jr. requires the Rigsby sisters to return the documents to E.A. Renfroe. January 2007 The Rigsby sisters testify for the Mississippi Attorney General before a Mississippi grand jury about what they saw while working as claims adjusters after Hurricane Katrina. In Alabama, Judge Acker orders the sisters to show why they should not be held in contempt of his order in December 2006 as they had yet to turn over the documents. Acker also requires Scruggs and the Scruggs law firm to show why they should not be held in civil contempt. In a court hearing on January 31, E.A. Renfroe's attorney requested the Rigsby sisters and their attorneys face civil and criminal charges for their actions.  February 2008  The charge of criminal contempt against Scruggs is dismissed.  April 2008  A federal judge dismissed the action by Thomas and Pamela McIntosh of bad faith and fraud against State Farm and Renfroe. They had filed a claim after State Farm minimized its liability by using a second engineering report which minimized wind damage for which State Farms was liable and blamed flood and storm. Judge Senter dismissed Renfroe, finding that there was no basis for the McIntoshes‚Äô claim of fraud against State Farm and Renfroe, and since there was no basis for a claim of fraud, Renfroe could not have ‚Äúaided and abetted‚Äù State Farm in a ‚Äúfraud that did not occur.‚ÄùMemorandum Opinion [Doc. No. 1185] by U. S. District Judge L. T. Senter, Jr. dated April 21, 2008 entered in McIntosh v. State Farm, Civil Action No. 1:06cv1080 LTS-RHW (S.D. Miss.)  September 2008  Thomas and Pamela McIntosh settle their lawsuit against State Farm for $250,000. Renfroe had already been dismissed from that lawsuit.Id  July 2009  The finding of contempt by the District Court overruled in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the eleventh circuit.  June 2010  Federal Magistrate Judge Robert Walker ruled that State Farm should not be required to hand over engineering reports to the Risbys, The case involved claimants Thomas and Pamela McIntosh whose house was damaged and two engineering reports, the first citing wind damage and the second tidal surges. The Risbys also were seeking any other altered reports in an attempt to establish a pattern of fraudulent behaviour.  June 2012  Judge Halil S Ozerden in the District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi ruled on final motions by State Farm and the Rigsbys. State Farms repeated motions to have the case dismissed were denied and the Rigsbys were limited to provided testimony only in the case of Thomas and Pamela McIntosh as they had direct knowledge of the documents in that case.  April 2013  In Federal Count a jury found for the Rigsby sisters in their whistle-blower lawsuit against State Farm. The plaintiffs suggested that State Farm minimized its wind damage payout to $30,000 when the policy provided for up to $500,000 by charging the National Flood Insurance Program where payments were paid by the government. FEMA‚Äôs Executive Director testified at trial that, after investigating the allegations, he personally didn‚Äôt believe that there was any fraud by State Farm, and he confirmed that FEMA had not asked State Farm to repay any money to the National Flood Insurance Program.  March 2014  In the federal court a jury found that State Farm had defrauded the government in a policyholder claim. State Farm was ordered to pay the Rigsbys attorneys $2.6 million plus expenses of just over $300,000. The Rigsby sisters were to each receive 15 percent of the $750,000 awarded to the government. The case involved the claim of Thomas and Pamela McIntosh only and the judge refused to allow any claims on other properties to be included. The Rigsbys launched an appeal to the 5th U.S, Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.  April 2015  State Farm is sued in a claim filed 21 April by the Mississippi Attorney General over allegations that they minimized wind damage in their response to claims which resulted in the states Homeowner Assistance Program paying far more than it should have. The private attorneys for the Rigsbys have been engaged by the state.  July 2015  The Rigsby sisters were successful in their qui tam appeal in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to expand their claims of fraud in relation to the adjustment of National Flood Insurance Program claims. The court found that many homeowners were covered by at least two policies, one for wind and one for flood. A private insurance company administering both policies would be liable for wind damage but would pay flood damage with government funds. It would be in the company's interest to classify Hurricane Katrina damage as flood related to minimize its exposure to payouts. State Farm argues that the case should have been dismissed as the Rigsbys lawyer, Scruggs sent documents to the media when they were still under seal. Scruggs was gaoled over another matter and the court ruled that violating the seal should not result in the dismissal of the case,  August 2015  State Farm to challenge the ruling by the Fifth Circuit in the U.S. Supreme Court with a certiorari petition. Their argument centres around the plaintiffs talking with the media and thus violating the 60 day seal provisions of the False Claims Act.  June 2016  State Farm has lodged a case in the U.S. Supreme Court, 'State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby, to be heard in the term which commences in October 2016. State Farm is arguing that the attorneys for the Rigsbys violated a part of the False Claims Act, that is they released documents which were under the 60 day seal rule. The decision of the Supreme Court has ramifications beyond the matter being argued, as the Rigsbys attorneys argue that State Farms actions could involve thousands of cases. State Farm want clarification on the 60 day seal rule as in this particular matter the breaching of the rule was overlooked by a lower court and the action allowed to continue.  November 1, 2016  Arguments before the Supreme Court. The justices will vote at the end of the week, but the complexity of the case means that it will most probably come down to a written judgement after they achieve consensus over the winter. The case is pending.

With comedian Jack Pearl, Bard worked in a comedy duo in vaudeville. In 1926, Bard, Pearl, and Sascha Beaumont appeared in a short film made in Lee DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process. He had a small role in The Bat Whispers (1930). Later in the decade, he ran a leading Hollywood acting school, Ben Bard Drama. Bard was recruited to be a leading man at Fox Film Corporation. However, he was typecast as a \\"Suave Heavy\\"--a smooth-talking, well-dressed fellow with a dark side. An example of this type is his portrayal of \\"Mr. Brun\\" in The Seventh Victim (1943). Also in 1943, Bard appeared in two other Val Lewton-produced horror films: The Leopard Man, as Robles, the Police Chief, and The Ghost Ship, as First Officer Bowns. Bard became the head of the New Talent Department at Twentieth-Century-Fox in September 1956, eventually resigning in August 1959. He re-opened his school, Ben Bard Drama, in 1960. Personal life * In 1929 he married the serial film star Ruth Roland, and was married to Roland until her death in 1937. * In 1939, he married Roma Clarisse, an actress and last recipient of the Ruth Roland Scholarship to Ben Bard Drama.

It is owned by Irish Distillers, a subsidiary of Pernod Ricard. Located alongside is the Old Midleton Distillery, which was established in the early 17th century and now operates as a visitor centre known as the Jameson Experience. History In 1966, John Power & Son, John Jameson & Son and the Cork Distilleries Company (which owned the Old Midleton distillery) merged to form the Irish Distillers Group. The board of the newly formed company decided to close their existing distilleries and consolidate all production at a new facility. This was built at Midleton as it was the only existing site with room for expansion. In July 1975, production ended at The Old Jameson Distillery and began in the new one. The old distillery has since been turned into a visitor centre. Since 2010, the distillery has expanded vastly, with Irish Distillers investing over ‚Ç¨200 million to double the capacity of the plant and build a new maturing facility in Dungourney, a nearby village. Production Midleton is one of the most modern distilleries in the world and has its production areas linked via fibre-optic networks. The distillery boasts three 75,000 litre pot stills (the largest currently in operation worldwide), and three column stills, which are used in combination to produce different types of whiskey. With a total production capacity of 64 million litres per annum, the distillery is the largest in Ireland. The distillery also hosts a micro distillery with smaller pot stills, which have the capacity to produce about 50,000 L of alcohol per annum. Visitor attractions The New Midleton Distillery is next to the Old Midleton distillery, home of the visitors centre called the Jameson Experience. Like the visitors centre in Dublin at the Old Jameson Distillery, the tour explains the history of Jameson Whiskey. The story is told through a series of reconstructed scenes from the original distillery in Dublin, exhibition areas that show the seven stages of whiskey making, and a video that shows what the distillery was like when the creator John Jameson was alive. Small numbers of visitors can also participate in a taste test between Jameson Whiskey, Scottish whisky, and American whiskey to become a \\"Qualified Irish Whiskey Taster\\". In 2013, a new Irish Whiskey Academy was opened in the Midleton Distillery Grounds offering a range of one to three day Irish whiskey appreciation courses and training for Irish whiskey aficionados, journalists and other members of the drinks profession and industry. The grounds of the old Midleton Distillery also houses the official historical archives for the Irish Distillers Whiskey labels in the old Master Distillers House. Whiskeys produced As a result of the different stills combinations that can be achieved, a range of different products can be produced. The most significant brands produced are: *Jameson - The best selling Irish whiskey in the world *Tullamore Dew - owned by William Grant & Sons (No longer produced as Tullamore has its own distillery as of 2014) *Powers *Paddy *Redbreast *Midleton Very Rare In September 2014, Midleton Distillery invited their Master Distiller Emeritus Barry Crockett out of retirement to join his successor Master Distiller Brian Nation in producing a limited expression of just 117 bottles of Midleton Very Rare 30th Anniversary Pearl Edition to commemorate 30 years of Midleton Irish Whiskey. *Green Spot *Red Spot *Yellow Spot Other products *Cork Dry Gin *Huzzar Vodka See also * Cooley Distillery * Irish whiskey brands * Old Bushmills Distillery  References External links * Jameson Irish Whiskey website * Irish Distillers website * Tullamore Dew website * Jameson Experience Tour website Distilleries in the Republic of Ireland Midleton Pernod Ricard brands Tourist attractions in County Cork Irish companies established in 1975 ","title":"New Midleton Distillery"},{"id":"9637998","text":"Reuben Wilson (born April 9, 1935) is a jazz organist.

Gameplay involves players each drawing one of fifteen numbered markers called peas or pills at random from a , which assigns to them the correspondingly numbered pool ball, kept secret from their opponents, but which they must pocket in order to win the game. Kelly pool is a game, which means that players must contact the lowest numbered on each shot first until the opportunity to pocket their own is presented. Two rule variants are set forth under rules promulgated by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA). In the simpler form, the object of play starts and ends with the goal of pocketing one's secret ball. In the second, in addition to the goal of pocketing one's secret ball, points are scored in various ways. In the instance where pills are unavailable, a cloth may be used to cover the balls, which are then chosen blindly, recorded, and replaced for play. Reportedly invented by Chicagoan Calistus \\"Kelly\\" Mulvaney in 1893, kelly pool was a popular game during the early- to mid-20th century. Mentions of it were at one time common in US newspapers, often painting it in a negative light as its play was considered a stronghold of gambling. Authorities in various parts of the United States at times called for a moratorium on the game's play. Until 1964, in fact, playing the game was a fineable offense in the state of Montana. Many billiard-specific and etymological sources point to kelly pool, or an early version of the game called kelly rotation, as the origin of the common idiom, \\"behind the eight ball\\". Some publications blithely assume the expression to be eponymously derived from the game of eight ball, but it has been pointed out that the expression came into use before eight ball was popularized, and that the game did not even use an actual 8 ball under the version first marketed to the public. The predecessor to the BCA, The National Billiard Association, meanwhile, holds that the expression simply emanates from the fact that the eight ball, being black-colored, is harder to see than other balls, thus resulting in an association with any difficult position. Origins Detail from 1910 United States Census listing Calistus Mulvaney; the \\"Father of Kelly pool\\" According to an article which appeared in the June 29, 1913 edition of the Chicago Tribune, \\"Kelly pool was invented by Kelly Mulvaney\\". The quote is attributed in the article to Hugh E. Keough, a well- known Chicago sportswriter of 31 years. Further information is provided in a November 10, 1916 Indianapolis Star obituary for one Calistus Mulvaney, who is listed as having died the preceding day. Accessed through Ancestry.com database, May 24, 2009. The obituary, entitled \\"Originated 'Kelly Pool, states that: \\"... for thirty five years [Mulvaney] was identified with Kelly pool in the loop district ... He was widely known as the father of 'Kelly pool' and better known as Kelly Mulvaney than Calistus. He was born at Fox Lake Wis[consin] sixty-five years ago.\\" In Calistus Mulvaney's entry in the 1910 United States Census (pictured at right), his occupation is listed as \\"billiard hall emp[loyee]\\" and his position there as \\"keeper\\".Calistus Mulvaney's entry in the 1910 United States Census. Refer to :File:1910 Census detail-Calistus Mulvaney.jpg. As part of the same household, Mulvaney's brother-in-law's listing appears on the same census page, with his occupation and position identically recorded. The census records Mulvaney's age in 1910 as 56, his birthdate as \\"about 1854\\", his birthplace as Wisconsin, his spouse's name as Kate, and his area of residence at that time as Chicago Ward 14, Cook Co., Illinois. Although there is a given-name discrepancy, additional illumination is provided by Simpson M. Ritter in the publication From the Annals of Sports. As Simpson is quoted in the book Sports in the Pulp Magazines by John A. Dinan: Gameplay Kelly pool accommodates players with a wide variety of skill levels. The game is designed for group play with a minimum of 2 players, best suited for 4‚Äì6, but allowing up to 15 to take part. The Billiard Congress of America (BCA) publishes a long-standardized set of rules for the game. Set up racks: The 1 ball is at the apex of the rack and is on the foot spot, the 2 is in the corner to the racker's right, and the 3 ball in the left corner, with all other balls placed randomly, and all balls touching. At the start of kelly pool, the numbered markers (commonly called or pills, and sometimes tally balls or shake balls) are placed in a specially made, narrow-necked container (called variously a , pea bottle, pill bottle, kelly bottle, tally bottle or shake bottle) which is shaken to randomly distribute them. Each player then draws a numbered pea from the bottle. The number of the pea drawn assigns to that player the correspondingly numbered , which each player must keep secret from their opponents. The object of the game is for the player to legally pocket their assigned, undisclosed ball (sometimes called their \\"private number\\"). At the start of the game a standard set of fifteen pool object balls are racked at the end of a pool table, with the of the rack centered over the . Viewed from the racker's vantage point, the 1 ball is placed at the rack's apex, the 2 ball at the rack's right corner and the 3 ball at the rack's left corner (as in the game of rotation); all other object balls are placed randomly. An is required, meaning that at least four balls must be driven to rails (as opposed to a , such as is used for the opening break in straight pool and one-pocket). Rules of play Kelly pool is a game, which means that the lowest numbered ball on the table must be contacted by the cue ball on every shot. There are no called in kelly pool; the legal pocketing (i.e., with no committed on the same ) of the lowest numbered ball on the table, permits and requires the shooter to continue play. When a ball is illegally pocketed it is to the foot spot (or as close as possible, toward the ). If a foul is committed, there is no point penalty and the incoming player has the option of accepting the table in position, or requiring the offending player to continue shooting. However, when the foul is the result of jumping the cue ball off the table, or it into a pocket, the incoming player has from the (behind the ), and retains the option of forcing the opponent to shoot. Whichever player ultimately shoots with cue ball in hand has the option of spotting the object ball to the foot spot if it is in the kitchen area. Scoring There are two main scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, the first player to pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, although a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: *Two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number *A player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is not out of the game and can still win points in this way *If a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled. Association with gambling Detail of Kelly Pool comic by Clare Briggs appearing in the January 8, 1915 edition of The Washington Post Kelly pool has long been associated with gambling‚Äîso much so, that it was made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the state of Montana, for example, the playing of kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Accessed through Ancestry.com database, May 28, 2009.

It is often assumed that the expression derives from the inability to use the 8 ball in a combination in the game of eight-ball ‚Äì if the cue ball is directly behind the 8 ball a player has no direct shot. However the expression derives instead from kelly pool, as eight-ball was a less common, still developing game at the time the phrase arose. It refers to players assigned balls numerically higher than 8 ‚Äì that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in order ‚Äì who have less chance of winning, as the odds that other players have lower winning numbers increases for players with higher numbers. A more generic origin of the phrase that is independent of any particular game's rule, instead depending from a property of the 8 ball itself.The National Billiard Association, which was the governing body of billiards in the United States from 1921 to 1941 said in 1936: References Pool (cue sports) English-language idioms Sports originating in the United States ","title":"Kelly pool"},{"id":"9638008","title":"Tucson Roller Derby"},{"id":"9638014","text":"Vietnamese people in Russia form the 72nd-largest ethnic minority community in Russia according to the 2002 census.

Many consider him a member of a group of second-order cybernetics theoreticians such as Heinz von Foerster, Gordon Pask, Herbert Br√ºn and Ernst von Glasersfeld. Maturana, along with Francisco Varela and Ricardo B. Uribe, is particularly known for creating the term \\"autopoiesis\\" about the self- generating, self-maintaining structure in living systems, and concepts such as structural determinism and structure coupling.Maturana, Humberto & Varela, Francisco ([1st edition 1973] 1980).

(hardback), (paper) His work has been influential in many fields, mainly the field of systems thinking and cybernetics. Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.Magnus Ramage, Karen Shipp (2012) Systems Thinkers Life and career Maturana was born in Santiago, Chile. After completing secondary school at the Liceo Manuel de Salas in 1947, he enrolled at the University of Chile, studying first medicine then biology. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study anatomy and neurophysiology at University College London. He obtained a PhD in biology from Harvard University in 1958.See more biographical details in History: The Biology of Cognition Laboratory of the Universidad de Chile (1960‚Äì2006). Juan- Carlos Letelier, Gonzalo Marin & Jorge Mpodozis. Published online at.http://biologyofcognition.wordpress.com/about/ He works in neuroscience at the University of Chile, in the \\"Biolog√≠a del Conocer\\" (Biology of Knowing) research center. Maturana's work has been developed and integrated into the work on ontological coaching developed by Fernando Flores and Julio Olalla. In 1994 he received Chile's National Prize for Natural Sciences. As of 2000, Maturana established his own reflection and research center, the Instituto de Formaci√≥n Matriztica. Work Maturana, 2012 A drawing in zero time Maturana's research interest concerns concepts like cognition, autopoiesis, languaging, zero time cybernetics and structural determined systems. Maturana's work extends to philosophy and cognitive science and even to family therapy. He was inspired by the work of the biologist Jakob von Uexk√ºll. His inspiration for his work in cognition came while he was a medical student and became seriously ill with tuberculosis. Confined in a sanatorium with very little to read, he spent time reflecting on his condition and the nature of life. What he came to realize was \\"that what was peculiar to living systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves ... whether a dog bites me or doesn't bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself.\\" This paradigm of autonomy formed the basis of his studies and work. Maturana and his student Francisco Varela were the first to define and employ the concept of \\"autopoiesis\\". Aside from making important contributions to the field of evolution, Maturana is associated with an epistemology built upon empirical findings of neurobiology. Maturana and Varela wrote in their Santiago Theory of Cognition: \\"Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.\\"Maturana, Humberto R./Varela, Francisco J. (1980): Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living.

Zarnowitz was Senior Fellow and Economic Counselor to The Conference Board. He was Professor Emeritus of Economics and Finance, Graduate School of Business, The University of Chicago, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). In 1939, he fled Poland to escape the Nazi invasion, but was imprisoned by the Soviet Russians and worked at a labor camp in Siberia. Zarnowitz earned his Ph.D. in economics (summa cum laude) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany in 1951. He came to the United States in 1952. In 1959 he moved to Chicago and became a professor at the University of Chicago.Dennis Hevesi, Victor Zarnowitz, Who Faulted Business Forecasts, Dies at 89, The New York Times, February 25, 2009. He was a Fellow of the National Association of Business Economists, Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Honorary Fellow of the International Institute of Forecasters, and Honorary Member of the Center for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys (CIRET). In 2001, he received the William F. Butler Memorial Award from the New York Association for Business Economists. His numerous papers and books include An Appraisal of Short-Term Economic Forecasts (1967), The Business Cycle Today (1972), Orders, Production, and Investment (1973), and Business Cycles: Theory, History, Indicators, and Forecasting (1992). His most recent papers are \\"Has the Business Cycle Been Abolished?\\" (1998), \\"Theory and History Behind Business Cycles\\" (1999), and \\"The Old and the New in U.S. Economic Expansion\\" (2000). He was notable as a researcher on the performance of economic forecasting, and he concluded that economic forecasters have little success in predicting business cycle turning points. He established that planners are better off using the average of forecasts, rather than relying on any individual forecast. This has become a common practice on the part of governments in the setting of their budgets. Zarnowitz remained an active economist throughout his life. In 1999 he joined The Conference Board, the organization which publishes the Index of Leading Indicators and the Consumer Confidence Index. He continued working five-day weeks until the day before he died, according to The Conference Board, and he was also an active member of the Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research. His final decision with the committee was the determination that the Late-2000s recession had begun in December 2007.Sudeep Reddy, \\"Victor Zarnowitz, Recession Expert Since 1950s, Dies at 89\\", The Wall Street Journal, February 24, 2009.

In 1066 Ealdred, Archbishop of York, was the Lord, this in 1086 transferred to the canons of Beverley Minster, and the later Archbishop of York Thomas of Bayeux who was also Tenant-in-chief to King William I. In 1823 Molescroft was in the parish of Beverley Minster, and the Wapentake of Harthill. Population at the time was 111, with occupations including four farmers, and the landlord of The Wellington public house. Residents included two gentlemen.

It was first proposed as a reductio ad absurdum response to Ludwig Boltzmann's early explanation for the low-entropy state of our universe. In this physics thought experiment, a Boltzmann brain is a fully formed brain, complete with memories of a full human life in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare random fluctuations out of a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Theoretically, over an extremely large but not infinite amount of time, by sheer chance atoms in a void could spontaneously come together in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain. Like any brain in such circumstances, it would almost immediately stop functioning and begin to deteriorate. The idea is ironically named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844‚Äì1906), who in 1896 published a theory that tried to account for the fact that we find ourselves in a universe that is not as chaotic as the budding field of thermodynamics seemed to predict. He offered several explanations, one of them being that the universe, even one that is fully random (or at thermal equilibrium), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-entropy) state. One criticism of this \\"Boltzmann universe\\" hypothesis is that the most common thermal fluctuations are as close to equilibrium overall as possible; thus, by any reasonable criterion, actual humans in the actual universe would be vastly less likely than \\"Boltzmann brains\\" existing alone in an empty universe. Boltzmann brains gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many existing theories about the Universe, human brains in the current Universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future Universe who, by chance, have exactly the same perceptions that we do; this leads to the conclusion that statistically we ourselves are likely to be Boltzmann brains. Such a reductio ad absurdum argument is sometimes used to argue against certain theories of the Universe. When applied to more recent theories about the multiverse, Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved measure problem of cosmology. Boltzmann brains remain a thought experiment; physicists do not believe that we are actually Boltzmann brains, but rather use the thought experiment as a tool for evaluating competing scientific theories. Boltzmann universe In 1896, the mathematician Ernst Zermelo advanced a theory that the second law of thermodynamics was absolute rather than statistical.Brush, S. G., Nebulous Earth: A History of Modern Planetary Physics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 129. Zermelo bolstered his theory by pointing out that the Poincar√© recurrence theorem shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the Second Law, which is always observed to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann advanced two theories. The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state. The second and alternative theory, published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to Boltzmann's assistant Ignaz Sch√ºtz, is the \\"Boltzmann universe\\" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe spends the vast majority of eternity in a featureless state of heat death; however, over enough eons, eventually a very rare thermal fluctuation will occur where atoms bounce off each other in exactly such a way as to form a substructure equivalent to our entire observable universe. Boltzmann argues that, while most of the Universe is featureless, we do not see those regions because they are devoid of intelligent life; to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that we view solely the interior of our Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life lives. (This may be the first use in modern science of the anthropic principle).Carroll, S. M., \\"Why Boltzmann brains are bad\\" (Ithaca, New York: arXiv, 2017). In 1931, astronomer Arthur Eddington pointed out that, because a large fluctuation is exponentially less probable than a small fluctuation, observers in Boltzmann universes will be vastly outnumbered by observers in smaller fluctuations. Physicist Richard Feynman published a similar counterargument within his widely-read 1964 Feynman Lectures on Physics. By 2004, physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal \\"Boltzmann brains\\" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe. Spontaneous formation In the universe's eventual state of ergodic \\"heat death\\", given enough time, every possible structure (including every possible brain) gets formed via random fluctuation. The timescale for this is related to the Poincar√© recurrence time. Boltzmann-style thought experiments focus on structures like human brains that are presumably self-aware observers. Given any arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a Boltzmann brain (or planet, or universe), smaller structures that minimally and barely meet the criteria are vastly and exponentially more common than larger structures; a rough analogy is how the odds of a real English word showing up when you shake a box of Scrabble letters are greater than the odds that a whole English sentence or paragraph will form. The average timescale required for formation of a Boltzmann brain is vastly greater than the current age of the Universe. In modern physics, Boltzmann brains can be formed either by quantum fluctuation, or by a thermal fluctuation generally involving nucleation. Via quantum fluctuation By one calculation, a Boltzmann brain would appear as a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum after a time interval of 10^{10^{50}} years. This fluctuation can occur even in a true Minkowski vacuum (a flat spacetime vacuum lacking vacuum energy). Quantum mechanics heavily favors smaller fluctuations that \\"borrow\\" the least amount of energy from the vacuum. Typically, a quantum Boltzmann brain would suddenly appear from the vacuum (alongside an equivalent amount of virtual antimatter), remain only long enough to have a single coherent thought or observation, and then disappear into the vacuum as suddenly as it appeared. Such a brain is completely self-contained, and can never radiate energy out to infinity.Davenport, M., & Olum, K. D. (2010). Are there Boltzmann brains in the vacuum. arXiv preprint arXiv:1008.0808. Via nucleation Current evidence suggests that the vacuum permeating the observable Universe is not a Minkowski space, but rather a de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant.Mukhanov, V., Physical Foundations of Cosmology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 30. In a de Sitter vacuum (but not in a Minkowski vacuum), a Boltzmann brain can form via nucleation of non-virtual particles gradually assembled by chance from the Hawking radiation emitted from the de Sitter space's bounded cosmological horizon. One estimate for the average time required until nucleation is around 10^{10^{69}} years. A typical nucleated Boltzmann brain will, after it finishes its activity, cool off to absolute zero and eventually completely decay, as any isolated object would in the vacuum of space. Unlike the quantum fluctuation case, the Boltzmann brain will radiate energy out to infinity. In nucleation, the most common fluctuations are as close to thermal equilibrium overall as possible given whatever arbitrary criteria are provided for labeling a fluctuation a \\"Boltzmann brain\\". Theoretically a Boltzmann brain can also form, albeit again with a tiny probability, at any time during the matter-dominated early universe.Bousso, R., Freivogel, B., & Yang, I. S. (2008). Boltzmann babies in the proper time measure. Physical Review D, 77(10), 103514. Modern reactions to the Boltzmann brain problem Most cosmologists believe that if a theory predicts that Boltzmann brains vastly outnumber normal human brains, then this is a sign that something is wrong with the theory. Sean Carroll states \\"We're not arguing that Boltzmann Brains exist ‚Äî we're trying to avoid them.\\" Carroll has stated that the hypothesis of you being a Boltzmann brain results in \\"cognitive instability\\". Because, he argues, it would take longer than the current age of the universe for your brain to form, and yet you think observe that you exist in a younger universe, this shows that your memories and reasoning processes would be untrustworthy if you were indeed a Boltzmann brain. Seth Lloyd has stated \\"they fail the Monty Python test: Stop that! That's too silly!\\" A New Scientist journalist summarizes that \\"the starting point for our understanding of the universe and its behavior is that humans, not disembodied brains, are typical observers.\\" Some argue that brains produced via quantum fluctuation, and maybe even brains produced via nucleation in the de Sitter vacuum, don't count as observers. Quantum fluctuations are easier to exclude than nucleated brains, as quantum fluctuations can more easily be targeted by straightforward criteria (such as their lack of interaction with the environment at infinity). Some cosmologists believe that a better understanding of the degrees of freedom in the quantum vacuum of holographic string theory can solve the Boltzmann brain problem.Garriga, J., & Vilenkin, A. (2009). Holographic multiverse. Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2009(01), 021. Brian Greene states: \\"I am confident that I am not a Boltzmann brain. However, we want our theories to similarly concur that we are not Boltzmann brains, but so far it has proved surprisingly difficult for them to do so.\\" In single-Universe scenarios In a single de Sitter Universe with a cosmological constant, and starting from any finite spatial slice, the number of \\"normal\\" observers is finite and bounded by the heat death of the Universe. If the Universe lasts forever, the number of nucleated Boltzmann brains is, in most models, infinite; cosmologists such as Alan Guth worry that this would make it seem \\"infinitely unlikely for us to be normal brains\\". One caveat is that if the Universe is a false vacuum that locally decays into a Minkowski or a Big Crunch-bound anti- de Sitter space in less than 20 billion years, then infinite Boltzmann nucleation is avoided. (If the average local false vacuum decay rate is over 20 billion years, Boltzmann brain nucleation is still infinite, as the Universe increases in size faster than local vacuum collapses destroy the portions of the Universe within the collapses' future light cones). Proposed hypothetical mechanisms to destroy the universe within that timeframe range from superheavy gravitinos to a heavier-than-observed top quark triggering \\"death by Higgs\\".Boddy, K. K., & Carroll, S. M. (2013). Can the Higgs Boson Save Us From the Menace of the Boltzmann Brains?. arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.4686.Linde, A. (2007). Sinks in the landscape, Boltzmann brains and the cosmological constant problem. Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2007(01), 022. If no cosmological constant exists, and if the presently observed vacuum energy is from quintessence that will eventually completely dissipate, then infinite Boltzmann nucleation is also avoided.Carlip, S. (2007). Transient observers and variable constants or repelling the invasion of the Boltzmann's brains. Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2007(06), 001. In eternal inflation One class of solutions to the Boltzmann brain problem makes use of differing approaches to the measure problem in cosmology: in infinite multiverse theories, the ratio of normal observers to Boltzmann brains depends on how infinite limits are taken. Measures might be chosen to avoid appreciable fractions of Boltzmann brains. Unlike the single-universe case, one challenge in finding a global solution in eternal inflation is that all possible string landscapes must be summed over; in some measures, having even a small fraction of universes infested with Boltzmann brains causes the measure of the multiverse as a whole to be dominated by Boltzmann brains. The measurement problem in cosmology also grapples with the ratio of normal observers to abnormally early observers. In measures such as the proper time measure that suffer from an extreme \\"youngness\\" problem, the typical observer is a \\"Boltzmann baby\\" formed by rare fluctuation in an extremely hot, early universe. Identifying whether oneself is a Boltzmann observer In Boltzmann brain scenarios, the ratio of Boltzmann brains to \\"normal observers\\" is astronomically large. Almost any relevant subset of Boltzmann brains, such as \\"brains embedded within functioning bodies\\", \\"observers who believe they are perceiving 3 K microwave background radiation through telescopes\\", \\"observers who have a memory of coherent experiences\\", or \\"observers who have the same series of experiences as me\\", also vastly outnumber \\"normal observers\\". Therefore, under most models of consciousness, it is unclear that one can reliably conclude that oneself is not such a \\"Boltzmann observer\\", in a case where Boltzmann brains dominate the Universe. Even under \\"content externalism\\" models of consciousness, Boltzmann observers living in a consistent Earth-sized fluctuation over the course of the past several years outnumber the \\"normal observers\\" spawned before a Universe's \\"heat death\\". As stated earlier, most Boltzmann brains have \\"abnormal\\" experiences; Feynman has pointed out that, if one knows oneself to be a typical Boltzmann brain, one does not expect \\"normal\\" observations to continue in the future. In other words, in a Boltzmann-dominated Universe, most Boltzmann brains have \\"abnormal\\" experiences, but most observers with only \\"normal\\" experiences are Boltzmann brains, due to the overwhelming vastness of the population of Boltzmann brains in such a Universe.

It is served by the . The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History What eventually became the Michigan Central Railroad was begun in 1837, and the track reached Jackson by 1841. By the 1870s, multiple other lines served the city including the Jackson, Lansing and Saginaw Railroad, the Fort Wayne, Jackson and Saginaw Railroad, the Grand River Railway, and the Michigan Air Line Railroad. In 1872, the Michigan Central Railroad decided to construct a replacement for its earlier station built in 1841. The new station, named 'Jackson Union Station,'Pure Michigan, 'AMTRAK-Jackson Station' https://www.michigan.org/property/amtrak-jackson- station was used as a Union Station, serving all the other lines through Jackson except the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, which was then a major competitor with the Michigan Central. Construction began in late 1872, and finished in the summer of 1873. Passenger service into Jackson remained high until the coming of the automobile. New York Central service along the Chicago-Detroit-Buffalo-New York New York Special and the Wolverine (operating on the same route) made stops at Jackson. Other routes were the Chicago- Detroit Chicago Mercury; a Grand Rapids-Jackson train; and a Jackson-Lansing- Saginaw-Bay City train. Service to Bay City and Saginaw ended in 1959, and in 1964, when I-94 was completed, ridership dropped dramatically. In 1971, Amtrak took over the Detroit-Chicago passenger service through Jackson, which remains the only current service in the station. In 1978, the station underwent a refurbishing inspired by the nation's Bicentennial celebrations. Workers cleaned the brick exterior, reground the terazzo floors and refinished the elaborate wood trim and benches. Artist Leland Beamon created a mural showing the depot in 1904 alongside a modern Turboliner Amtrak train. Also in 1978, a former disgruntled New York Central employee named Rudy Bladel killed three former coworkers at the station.475 U.S. 627 The murder trial led to a U.S. Supreme Court case, Michigan v. Jackson, on the admissibility of confessions. Additional improvements were made in 2008, 2013, and 2018. Description The Jackson Station consists of two buildings: the depot proper and nearby Express Building. The depot is a single story red brick Italianate structure, measuring about 325 feet in length and 44 feet in width. The building has two- story blocks measuring 23 feet by 45 feet extending from the roof at either end. The building sits on a foundation of light brownish sandstone with a whitish sandstone sillcourse running on top. The long walls are divided into sixteen bays by projecting brick piers; each bay contains a single window or door. The windows are narrow, tall six-over-six sash units with a three-light transom above, placed in an arched head opening with a five-piece segmental sandstone lintel above and a sandstone sill below. The building's ends each contain a double doorway and a coupled window on the second story above. The flanking sections of the two-story blocks contain single second-floor windows. The building has a gable roof on the main section, with hipped roofs on the two-story blocks; the roofs are covered with modern asphalt shingles. The eaves have sheet metal cornices. On the track side, a wooden canopy runs along most of the building. The canopy is supported by cast iron columns. The Express Building is a single-story L-shaped, brick building with a hip roof. It measures approximately 98 feet by 82 feet along the longest sides. It sits on a light brownish sandstone foundation. The elevations are divided into bays by brick piers, with each bay containing a freight door or window.

Since 2003 they have issued several full-length albums, a split release with Mudhoney and a live album performing on stage together with Damo Suzuki. Mugstar recorded one of the last-ever Peel Sessions with the late John Peel on 5 May 2004. Record labels: Rock Action, Important Records (U.S.A.), Cardinal Fuzz, Agitated, Evil Hoodoo, Rocket Recordings, Trensmat, God Unknown, Chunklet Industries (U.S.A.), Hands In The Dark / All Time Low, Lancashire & Somerset, critical MASS... History Mugstar formed in Liverpool, England. Their first single, \\"Spotlight Over Memphis\\", drew attention from John Peel, who played the 7\\" on his radio show. It was after the next 7\\", \\"Flavin' HotRod\\", that Peel offered the band a Peel Session. A split 7\\" with Hunting Lodge followed. A mini-album on Kabukikore Records, \\"Dark Matter\\", came next, closely followed by a session for BBC Radio One's Huw Stephens. In January 2006 the band released \\"My Baby Skull Has Not Yet Flowered\\". The band's self-titled debut album was released on CD at the end of 2006 on Sea Records, and on Critical MASS Records as a limited run of heavy weight vinyl in 2007. Mugstar then started a productive relationship with Ireland-based Trensmat Records with a run of limited 7\\" singles. One of these releases was a split 7\\" with Seattle's Mudhoney, with both bands doing covers of Hawkwind songs. During this time Red Panda and Mugstar featured on a one-sided 10\\" single, each performing half of \\"Tam Lin\\", a song made famous by Fairport Convention. Mugstar signed to Important Records, who then released \\"...Sun, Broken...\\" CD in March 2010 and their third album, \\"Lime\\", was released also on CD in November 2010. For Record Store Day 2011 Mugstar contributed a cover of \\"I Got the Six\\" by ZZ Top for \\"I'm So Agitated\\", a 12\\" also featuring Carlton Melton, The Heads and Kool Aid, on Agitated Records. The \\"Lime\\" album got its vinyl release through Agitated Records in September 2011. These were followed by a split album on Rocket Recordings with New York's Oneida - called \\"Collisions 2\\" - and a 40 minute remix of \\"Serra\\" (from \\"Lime\\") by Loop's Robert Hampson. \\"Ad Marginem\\" - Original Film Soundtrack. Vinyl album with DVD, was released in September 2012. The film / album launch was celebrated with Mugstar performing the soundtrack live to film screenings, at Liverpool's Bluecoat and Rough Trade East in London. (The screening with live soundtrack has subsequently been performed a number of times... in Bishop's Castle, at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg (NL), The Cube Cinema, Bristol and most recently in 2018 in the Music Room at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall.) The release of the band's fifth album, Axis, followed in late 2012. In April 2013, they performed a radio session for Marc Riley on his BBC 6 Music evening show. For Record Store Day 2013 Mugstar released Centralia their sixth album on the Cardinal Fuzz label. Mugstar released Start from Zero a live album - recorded with Damo Suzuki in Liverpool, summer 2012 - on Important Records in January 2015. February 2016 saw Mugstar performing a second radio session for Marc Riley on his BBC 6 Music evening show. The double album: Magnetic Seasons was released in 2016 on Rock Action Records. The singles and rarities compilation album: Collapsar - Skull Scorchers & Neuron Phasers was released in December 2017 on double heavy vinyl format by Evil Hoodoo Records.

A military style high school with boarding facilities, it serves as both a military high school and the preparatory school for potential officers of the Peruvian Armed Forces, who make up most of its alumni.  Creation  On 18 January 1944, through Law 9890, the Academy was named after Leoncio Prado Guti√©rrez, one of the Peruvian heroes of the War of the Pacific (and the President's half-brother through their father Mariano Ignacio Prado's first marriage). On 15 July 1944 it was officially inaugurated and started to function. The first authorities of the Academy were Headmaster Army Colonel Jos√© del Carmen Mar√≠n Arista and Academic Director Dr. Manuel Velasco Alvarado. In 1945, Colonel Juan Mendoza Rodr√≠guez took over the direction of the school. Among the first teachers at the Academy were Gustavo Pons Muzzo, Alfredo Rebaza Acosta, Walter Pe√±alosa Ramella, Humberto Santill√°n Arista, Flavio Vega Villanueva, Ricardo Cazorla Sormani, and Luis Bedoya Reyes. Location and structure The school is located in the La Perla District on the border of Callao and the San Miguel District, Lima in the Costanera Avenue, number 1541. The structure was originally based on the 'Guardia Chalaca Barracks', made of two pavilions without doors or windows. Later on, the school was furnished with other facilities like a dining room, bedrooms, infirmary, laboratories, administrative offices, auditorium, swimming pool, a stadium, library, a gym and a coliseum enclosure. Academic reform Between 1977 and 1981 it went through a period of reform aimed to transforming it from a military secondary school to a Professional Education Centre, based on the Academic Reform standards which were being implemented at the time. Most of the teachers of the previous era migrated away from the school and a new badge of teachers joined the Academy. In 1982, it was decided to keep it as a secondary school. Currently, its academic programme is based on the guidelines of Peru's Ministry of Education.

This box set is similar to the earlier Pebbles Box (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc. Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records). However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box. Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \\"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) ‚Äì which is also included in the Pebbles Box ‚Äì in place of the much rarer \\"Wine Wine Wine\\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Release data This box set was released (reportedly in 2004) in the United Kingdom on the HIT Records label with a similar catalogue number as the Pebbles Box, #CDBOXX1. Like AIP Records ‚Äì which released the later albums in the Pebbles series ‚Äì Ubik Records is one of the record labels that was started by Bomp! Records. Similarities and differences with the Pebbles Box Nearly all of the tracks in the Pebbles Box are included on the corresponding disc in the Trash Box, with the bonus selections at the end of each disc. However, there are a few exceptions. On Disc Two, the second recording by the Inmates is \\"Fakirs and Thieves\\" rather than \\"I Can Make it Without You\\"; both songs are not otherwise available on Pebbles albums. The recordings by GONN and the Dearly Beloved are in reverse order on Disc Three in the Trash Box, as is also true of the songs by the Bethlehem Exit and Edgin Inds on Disc Four. Finally, the song on Disc Five of the Trash Box by the Bitter End is \\"Find Someone to Love\\" instead of \\"If You Want Somebody\\". Differences with the original Pebbles LPs While the Trash Box is supposed to collect the first five albums in the Pebbles series, the recordings in this box set are actually much different from both the original LPs and the original CDs. Specifically, as to the first Pebbles LP, 4 of the 8 tracks on Side 1 and 6 of the 8 tracks on Side 2 of the original LP are included on Disc One in the Trash Box and in the same order (plus \\"Rich with Nothin'\\" is on Disc Two). Some of the omissions are true garage rock classics, like \\"Spazz\\" and \\"I'm in Pittsburgh (and it's Raining)\\"; the other omitted songs are \\"Going All the Way\\" (which is also not included on the CD version of the original Pebbles album), \\"You Treat Me Bad\\", and the Canadian monster \\"1-2-5\\" (although there is another song by the Haunted on Disc Four). The situation is similar on the Pebbles, Volume 2 LP, where just 4 songs from Side 1 and 3 songs from Side 2 are on Disc Two of this set, with \\"Green Fuz\\" moved to the other side of Disc Two and the Electric Prunes radio commercial to Disc Three. The lamented deletions include legendary bands like Zakary Thaks and the Moving Sidewalks (where Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top started out), plus the remarkable track called \\"Makin' Deals\\" by the Satans that opened that LP, which has the same general theme and even some of the same lyrics as the later Stones classic, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". Songs by the Litter and The Squires and both cuts by the Dovers are also left off the Trash Box, along with the bratty \\"So What!\\" and (as already noted) \\"Wine Wine Wine\\". Disc Three includes 11 of the songs on the psychedelic grab-bag that is the Pebbles, Volume 3 LP; additionally (as noted below), two of the standout cuts on the album, \\"I'm Five Years Ahead of My Time\\" and \\"Voices Green and Purple\\" are among the bonus tracks on the Trash Box that are not on the Pebbles Box. There are also several other omissions: \\"I'm Allergic to Flowers\\", \\"Soggy Cereal\\", \\"Dom Kellar os Mods\\", \\"Like a Dribbling Fram\\" and the bonus track. As noted, all of the tracks on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been omitted from the Trash Box. Although many songs appear on other Pebbles albums, none of the recordings on Disc Four appear on the first five LPs in the Pebbles series. Finally, fully half of the recordings on Pebbles, Volume 5 are not included on Disc Five of the Trash Box: \\"Go Away\\", \\"You Don't Know Me\\", \\"Why\\", \\"Universal Vagrant\\", \\"I Tell No Lies\\", \\"You Need Love\\", \\"The Way it Used to Be\\", \\"I Need Love\\", and \\"The Way I Feel\\". Differences with the original Pebbles CDs When AIP Records reissued the first five volumes in the Pebbles series on CD, a few tracks were omitted. While most of these tracks are also among those that are omitted from both the Pebbles Box and the Trash Box, there is a single exception: \\"Cracking Up\\" by the Wig was inadvertently left off the CD reissue of Pebbles, Volume 1 ‚Äì although it is listed on the printed material for the CD ‚Äì and is included on both of these box sets (on Disc One). Additionally, the two best omitted tracks from the Pebbles, Volume 3 LP are on the Trash Box but not on the Pebbles Box: \\"I'm Five Years Ahead of My Time\\" by the Third Bardo is a bonus track on Disc One, and \\"Voices Green and Purple\\" by the Bees is a bonus track on Disc Two. For the most part, however, this section concentrates on the bonus tracks on the CDs as compared to the Trash Box. There are many more bonus tracks on the Trash Box than on the Pebbles CDs: Other than Pebbles, Volume 4 (which is completely omitted from both box sets), there are 19 bonus tracks on the individual Pebbles CDs that are not on the individual Pebbles LPs, as compared to 37 bonus tracks on the Trash Box that are not on the Pebbles Box. Although less than one-half of these 19 tracks are included on the Trash Box, most of those are also on the Pebbles Box. Regarding Pebbles, Volume 1, \\"Ain't No Friend of Mine\\" by the Sparkles is a bonus track on Disc Two; while the classic \\"Blackout of Gretely\\" by GONN is not included, the band's \\"Doin' Me In\\" is on Disc Four of both box sets. Among the bonus tracks on the Pebbles, Volume 2 CD, the second song by the Choir is a bonus track on Disc Four of the Trash Box; \\"She'll Lie\\" by Satan & D-Men is on Disc Four of both box sets; and \\"Crazy Things\\" by the Quid is on Disc Three of both box sets.

Class II and III jobs are located within MCC. Class III jobs provide essential services to the facility such as maintenance, janitorial, clerical warehouse workers, and kitchen work. Class II jobs are designed to reduce the cost of goods and services to state agencies and other tax-supported entities. These include laundry services, a print shop, a license tab shop, and the panel program. Class I industries were once housed at MCC, but were eliminated in July 2004 as a result of a Washington Supreme Court decision that held that inmates cannot be employed by private commercial enterprises. Inmates have access to classification and mental health counselors at MCC, in addition to a wide range of paid and volunteer staff. Organization Monroe Correctional Complex is located on a 365-acre campus in Monroe, Washington. On campus are five housing units: *SOU *MSU *WSRU *TRU *IMU These vary from minimum to Super maximum security. Units Washington State Reformatory Unit (WSRU) - The original prison at the site; constructed in 1910. WSR is the second oldest prison in the state, only to Washington State Penitentiary. WSR has a capacity of approximately 720, and houses minimum, medium, and maximum custody inmates. There are also extended family visit trailers for family style visits with immediate relatives, available to the entire Monroe complex. WSR also has an inpatient hospital on the 4th floor that is classified as Maximum security even though the rest of the facility is medium, which classifies WSRU as a (Maximum Security) rating for DOC's transport rating System. The 4th floor hospital is also used by other correctional facilities within the state. Major medical care can often be performed here along with daily dialysis, X-ray, and minor medical procedures, but serious surgical procedures are performed in community hospitals. Special Offender Unit (SOU) - Opened in 1980 as Special Offender Center (SOC) under Gov. Dixy Lee Ray, and later renamed to Special Offender Unit (currently SOU) under Gov. Jay Inslee, the Special Offender Unit houses Mentally Ill Incarcerated Individuals, and has a 400 bed capacity. Security Levels are Maximum, Close, Medium and Minimum. The SOU is unique in that it also employed Psychology Doctors to assess and treat mentally ill incarcerated individuals as part of its base operation unlike other facilities. Twin Rivers Unit (TRU) - Originally known as Twin Rivers Corrections Center, the Twin Rivers Unit was opened in 1984. With a population capacity of 800, TRU houses both minimum and medium security levels. The Washington State Sex Offender Treatment and Assessment Program is located at TRU, and those participating in the program are housed there. Minimum Security Unit (MSU) - Opened in 1997, the Minimum Security Unit has a capacity of 470. The MSU has a program housing Mentally Ill incarcerated individuals that allows them to transfer to minimum from other security levels. This program is the only one in the state. MSU houses incarcerated individuals with less than 4 years to serve. Intensive Management Unit (IMU) - Opened in 2007, the IMU being Violator Unit and Intensive Management System (IMS) has a capacity of 200+, 100+ of that being designated for probation violators. To note the Violator unit, not holding incarcerated individual (prison inmates) allows double bunking which increases the maximum number of violators to 150+. The IMS houses incarcerated individuals that are difficult to manage or are a threat to others due to excessively violent outbursts in other facilities, and has a security level of super maximum, no incarcerated individual is allowed to walk freely in IMS unlike in maximum custody. It requires, by state policy a minimum of 2 officers to directly control and escort 1 incarcerated individual while they are in waist chains. IMS has extremely controlled movement where as the Violator unit is treated as Minimum to medium security where violators can move in their respective day rooms with no officers present in the day room, IMS is one of the administrative segregations for the facility. History The Washington State Reformatory opened in 1910, making it the second oldest operational prison in Washington state, behind the Washington State Penitentiary. The next facility opened was the Special Offender Unit in 1980. In 1984 the Twin Rivers Corrections Center was opened. It is now known as the Twin Rivers Unit. In 1997 the Minimum Security Unit was opened. In 2007 the Intensive management unit was opened. On January 29, 2011, Officer Jayme Biendl was strangled to death with an amplifying cord by an inmate within prison walls. Inmate Byron Scherf was accused of the murder. Officer Biendl had repeatedly filed work orders for additional security measures to her supervisors which went unanswered. One of her supervisors, Sergeant Jimmy Fletcher, signed a sworn affidavit that he had signed one of the work orders and forwarded it up the chain of command. In reaction to the murder, Washington DOC Officers now carry pepper spray and a \\"panic button\\" in case of emergency. No other changes have been made for incarcerated individual activities. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the Monroe complex had eleven positive cases‚Äîfive staff and six inmates in the same minimum security unit. Over 100 prisoners at the complex rioted on April 8 in response to the outbreak, but were broken up by corrections officers using crowd control tactics and an evacuation of housing units. The following day, Governor Inslee announced plans to release nonviolent offenders and at-risk inmates to lower the risk of infection.

Jordan befriended the pair later through his being in their older siblings' dance classes. The band was formed after they went to auditions being held by their management company. After winning, they signed with Fervent Records and started writing songs. They were featured opening acts on the Winter Jam 2008 and 2009 tours and with Jump5 for Jump5's farewell tour in which they performed songs from their first album. Although they have disbanded, they still plan to individually work on other projects that include singing. Their last concert was on March 4, 2011, at 7:00 pm at the Fellowship Bible Church in Brentwood, Tennessee.  pureNRG (2006-2007)  Work on their self-titled album was in progress as early as 2006. Jordan Yates, the frontman, had originally come up with the idea of the album being titled \\"The 360 EP\\". Plans changed and on May 1, 2007, they released their self-titled album pureNRG on Fervent Records. The record spawned 3 singles; \\"360\\", \\"What If\\", and \\"Footloose\\". \\"Footloose\\" received heavy radio play on Radio Disney and other Pop format radio stations. The record was produced by Rob Hawkins and vocals were produced Mark Hammond, both of which were first timers in their association with the band. The band was extremely proud of the album and called it \\"A very good first impression\\".  Here We Go Again (2007-2008)  By the end of 2007, thoughts on another album had already come to mind and the group again started writing songs. They finished in mid-March and on April 29, 2008, they released their second album Here We Go Again. It is somewhat of a cover album covering songs like \\"Call on Jesus\\" by Nicole C. Mullen and \\"More\\" by Matthew West. Jordan Yates, lead vocalist, said this about the album: \\"There's no reinvention here really, more like reiteration. I think we should give ourselves a pat on the back on this one.\\" Despite being successful in both Christian and Mainstream markets, no concert or tour was used to promote the album. The Precious Girls Club edition was also released in 2008 with one new track, The Precious Girls Club Theme Song.  A pureNRG Christmas and reNRGized (2008)  PureNRG released a Christmas album A pureNRG Christmas around Labor Day 2008. The album was delayed at first due to both personal issues and busy-work with their previously released albums, but, after some consideration, was finally released. It marked the band's first Christmas album. In late 2008, they also released a remix album with the name \\"ReNRGized\\". The band described it as \\"very eccentric but still having the same kinda music style.\\"  The Real Thing, Graduation: The Best Of pureNRG, and disbandment (2009-2011)  In mid-2009, after previous promotion of their new album, their last studio album The Real Thing was released. They released their final album Graduation: The Best of pureNRG on July 20, 2010. The band decided to disband sometime in late 2010. According to an interview with TVoneLife, reasons included \\"wanting to be kids again\\" and \\"get back into school and education\\". Also according to the same interview, Carolyne went into 9th grade, Caroline went into 10th grade, and Jordan went into 12th grade in the fall of 2010. Their mission was to \\"entertain, educate, and promote Christian values to young people. Using wholesome and uplifting lyrics in our music and with music and dance in order to provide positive role-models and we just really hope that we can showcase that being a child of God is just really so awesome and nobody can ever take that away from you no matter what happens and that's just the whole reason that we get up on stage and perform for everybody and they really hope that we can get that message across through our music.\\" They went on a farewell tour in the fall of 2010, celebrating the four years they had spent as a band. All of the members said that they were very sad to be disbanding, but they felt that God was calling them out. Their last performance was at Fellowship Bible Church in Brentwood, Tennessee on March 4, 2011. PureNRG officially disbanded on Friday, March 4, 2011.

It was released, as the B-side of the single \\"Miss You\\", on Rolling Stones Records, on 9 June 1978. Rolling Stone made it the 73rd song in their list of '100 Greatest Rolling Stones Songs'. Origin Mick Jagger and Keith Richards collaborated extensively on writing and composing the song, which was recorded in late 1977. A bootleg version with Richards singing exists. The Stones, longtime country music fans, incorporated many aspects of Bakersfield-style country music into this song. These included in particular Ronnie Wood's use of a pedal steel guitar for a solo and highlights, an instrument used on other songs from the album such as \\"Shattered\\" and \\"When the Whip Comes Down.\\" Also of note is the plodding rhythm of Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman. Richards performed acoustic and electric guitars as well as sharing piano duties with Jagger. Content In the lyrics, the loneliness of life and the possibilities in finding love are dealt with: The verses of the song are half sung, half spoken, with Jagger using a parodic Southern accent: In a 1978 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jagger said: \\"You know, when you drive through Bakersfield on a Sunday morning or Sunday evening‚ÄîI did that about six months ago‚Äîall the country music radio stations start broadcasting black gospel services live from L.A. And that's what the song refers to. But the song's really about driving alone, listening to the radio.\\" On influences, Jagger stated: \\"I wouldn't say this song was influenced specifically by Gram (Parsons). That idea of country music played slightly tongue-in-cheek‚ÄîGram had that in 'Drugstore Truck Drivin' Man', and we have that sardonic quality, too.\\" Asked by the interviewer if the girl in the song was a real one, Jagger replied, \\"Yeah, she's real, she's a real girl we used to know, we miss her.\\" Performances The Rolling Stones have performed \\"Far Away Eyes\\" sporadically since its introduction to their repertoire. It is performed in the concert film Some Girls: Live in Texas '78, featuring fiddle player Doug Kershaw. A live recording from July 1995 was included on the album Totally Stripped (2016), and a performance from the Stones' 2006 A Bigger Bang Tour appears in the 2008 concert film Shine a Light and on the accompanying live album. On 20 May 2013 the song was performed in Los Angeles as part of the Stones' \\"50 & Counting Tour.\\" During their Zip Code Tour the Stones performed \\"Far Away Eyes\\" at LP Field in Nashville, Tennessee on 17 June 2015. The song has been covered by The Handsome Family on their 2002 album Smothered and Covered. Promotional video The official promotional video was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed several other videos for the band, including those for \\"Start Me Up,\\" \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" and \\"Fool to Cry.\\" Lindsay-Hogg also directed promotional videos for The Beatles and The Who.

Formation The group was formed in the early 1980s, after Gaddafi's official resignation as Libyan head of state in favour of the title of \\"Brotherly Leader and Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\\". According to Joseph T. Stanik, Gaddafi reportedly employed a cadre of female bodyguards because he believed that an Arab gunman would have difficulty firing at women. However, it has also been submitted by other authors that Gaddafi's female bodyguards were, in reality, just an aspect of the dictator's well-known eccentric showmanship and his fondness of surrounding himself with young women. Gaddafi would usually travel with 15 of his Amazonian Guards assigned to security or housekeeping. Training Candidates for the Amazonian Guard underwent extensive firearms and martial arts training at a special academy, were required to take an oath of chastity, and had to have been hand-picked by Gaddafi himself. Incidents In 1998, one of Gaddafi's female bodyguards was killed and seven others were wounded when Islamic fundamentalists in Libya ambushed Gaddafi's motorcade. It was claimed that the dead guard, Aisha, was Gaddafi's favourite and threw herself across Gaddafi's body to stop the bullets. In November 2006, as Gaddafi arrived at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, Nigeria, with a 200-strong troop of heavily armed bodyguards, a diplomatic incident was caused as security officials tried to disarm them. Gaddafi furiously walked away, gesturing that he intended to cover the 40 km journey to the capital on foot, and could only be persuaded to yield after intervention by Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, who coincidentally was also at the airport. Abuse claims In the latter days of the Libyan Civil War, accusations emerged from five members of the Amazonian Guard of rape and other abuse by the upper echelons of the Gaddafi government, which included Gaddafi, his sons and senior officials. Some Amazonian Guards have also claimed that they were forced to execute rebels or be killed themselves.

It substantially expanded the powers of the Senate and the magnates, at the expense of the king. Furthermore, it de facto introduced a republican form of government. The privilege was, however, not confirmed by the king after his election, and in 1504 was rejected by the Sejm (see ≈Åaski's Statutes). After the death of Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk (1492), the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was broken. New king of Poland was Jan Olbracht, while Lithuania was governed by his brother Aleksander. Following his father, Olbracht tried to win the support of the nobility, granting it several concessions in the Statutes of Piotrk√≥w. The failed invasion of Moldavia in 1497 complicated internal situation of Poland, and strengthened the position of the magnates. At the same time, Lithuania was attacked by Ivan III of Russia, and in 1499 both nations signed the Union of Krak√≥w and Vilna, which returned the Polish ‚Äì Lithuanian alliance. In 1500 Jan Olbracht died, and on October 3, 1501, Aleksander Jagiellonczyk became the King of Poland. His election worsened the position of the Lithuanians, who agreed to the Union of Mielnik. Aleksander himself had to sign the Privilege of Mielnik, which limited his authority, and expanded the powers of the Senate: * the Senate became major governing body of Poland, and in case of dissent, the decision of the highest senators was binding, * the king was to be head of the senate, and his weak position was emphasized by his new title, \\"princeps senatus\\", which referred to the Roman tradition, * the king lost the right to name senators by himself. New senators were to be named only with the permission of the Senate, * starostas, who had previously been royal representatives, were subjected to the Senate, * senators were to answer only to the Senate, * senators were allowed to renounce allegiance to the king in some situations. The new political system of Poland, created by the privilege, was disliked by the nobility, which refused to pay taxes and to take part in the pospolite ruszenie. Starostas did not cooperate with senators, and during the 1504 Sejm, which took place in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, Jan Laski initiated attack on the powerful Lesser Poland magnates. As a result, the nobility managed to regain their position, and during the 1505 Sejm in Radom, the Nihil novi act was introduced, which voided the Privilege of Mielnik.

This helps the cell avoid obstacles and causes other objects to bounce off of the cell's outer membrane. The paramecium does this by reversing the direction in which its cilia beat. This results in stopping, spinning or turning, after which point the paramecium resumes swimming forward. If multiple avoidance reactions follow one another, it is possible for a paramecium to swim backward, though not as smoothly as swimming forward. Avoidance reaction occurs when the cell hits an obstruction, providing an anterior, mechanical stimulus:  The cell will then reverse.  It will then stop and rotate.  Now facing a new direction, the cell will move off in that direction. This process will continue until the cell is able to negotiate its way around the obstruction. Movement of Paramecium cells is caused by control of calcium ions inside the cell and membrane potentials. The simplest explanation for the avoidance reaction is that membrane potential controls the influx of calcium ions, which regulates the beat frequency and angles of cilia on the surface of the cell.

The piece has five distinct parts and has become a favorite among audiences and bands though the story behind it has been virtually forgotten.  The Music  The Witch and the Saint has a running time of 10:22. It is a tone poem, composed in 2004. Overall, it‚Äôs an epic pieceanyone listening to it without knowing the story behind it would get the impression of a melancholy story being told through powerful musical phrases. The piece opens with a thundering timpani triplet. A Gregorian chant type motif follows quietly and builds throughout the brass instrument section. The dark, threatening feel is broken suddenly by a melody portrayed by an oboe or flute solo as the bells join on after the new mood is established. That certain melody is recurrent and returns three more times in the entire piece. This first time, the melody is very airy. The eight-bar solo ends with the return of the ominous feel before the entire band is made to crescendo enormously. From here, the piece speeds up dramatically. The primary melody is established by the first flutes, and the texture builds from here, growing progressively uneasy. The climax of the section is very Medieval sounding, and reaches an entirely new altitude not seen again in this piece. This section is noted for being difficult for the flutes and piccolo, as they are expected to play legato and slurred right at the top of their registers and intonation flaws are easily noticeable throughout due to the registers and chords in most parts. The tempo and velocity of the piece dies down, and the slow melody repeats itself here, this time in a lower key and by the first flutes. To accompany this, a French horn melody is introduced, followed again by the previous melody in a different key. The reminiscent fast section begins againthis time in a different key, with an altered melody. This section is far less angry, but houses a different sort of velocity, the emphasis on the low sections of the band as opposed to the higher sections the first time. The final section of the piece comes in with the final occurrence of the slow melody. Note that the previous times evoked sadness, hopelessness and loneliness. This time, it is heroic, and very full of hope. The band is playing with a thicker assortment of textures and counter-melodies. The piece, which by now seems to end on a happy note, drops the heroism and a few thundering angry notes roar, then suddenly fade into a melancholy echo of the very beginning.  Reception  Plainly, this piece has gained much popularity by conductors, performers, and audiences. Performers find the piece very satisfying as each instrument is given independence. Instruments such as the tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, Euphonium and the French horn have numerous solos, so much of the attention is dispersed evenly. Also, many different sections have their own part in the melody including the saxophone, the clarinet, and the percussion section (especially the chimes and bells). Conductors favor this piece due to challenging chords, strange time signatures, but most importantly, the independence of instruments normally overshadowed.  The story  Helena and Sibylla were twins born in Germany in 1588. In that era twins were a bad omen and said to draw evil towards them. The girls also had the gift of foresight and were able to see that which had not yet come to pass. The suspicions of the general public were supported once the girls were old enough and began using their ability. Sibylla was raised at home and it took very little time for the village to notice her unexplainable knowledge of the future. When they did, She was labeled witch and sorceress by the townsfolk and was hated and feared. She led a quiet, empty childhood being bullied and shunned by society. Helena led a very different life. She was sent away to a convent to be raised in the church as a nun. Once her ability was discovered the community revered her and she was seen as a saint and sage by everyone and given the highest respect by even the wisest of men. The two girls grew up facing their own challenges and struggles trying to fit into the societies in to which they had been placed. Helena continued her life as a saint and prophet and Sibylla learned to be a midwife and helped the people as best she could. She was eventually accused of being a witch and sent to jail for life. Helena learned of her sister‚Äôs trouble and raced back to the town they had been born in to rescue her. Helena freed her sister from the jail and they ran off towards the forest. Before they got very far, however, they were captured. In her fear of the wrath of the villagers, and of the torment, Helena drank a poison and died in her sister‚Äôs arms. Sibylla‚Äôs heart was shattered, and while still grieving the loss of the only one in the world she had ever loved, she buried her sister‚Äôs body. She then rode off to find a place where she would not be known as a witch. She was never seen again. Alternative: It is also said that Helena was burned at the stake for aiding a witch. Alternative: Helena felt bad for her sister and traded places with her. So Sibylla became a saint and Helena a witch.

The oldest dated fossils of these stem members were found in the Barremian Castrillo de la Reina Formation of Spain, dating to approximately 129.4 to 125.0 million years ago. With their deep skulls and jaws, Rhabdodontids were similar to large, robust iguanodonts. The family was first proposed by David B. Weishampel and colleagues in 2003. Rhabdodontid fossils have been mainly found in Europe in formations dating to the Late Cretaceous. The defining characteristics of the clade Rhabdodontidae include the spade-shape of the teeth, the presence of three or more premaxillary teeth, the distinct difference between the two maxillary and dentary teeth ridge patterns, and the uniquely shaped femur, humerus, and ulna. Members of Rhabdodontidae have an adult body length of 1.6 to 6.0 meters.  Description = Teeth  Rhabdodontids have a simple dentition with leaf-shaped teeth used for a powerful scissors-like shearing. These teeth are well-suited to a diet of tough and fibrous plants, examples of which include monocts and grass. Each tooth has a ridge on it that is offset from the midline of the tooth. These ridges also have a specific pattern which is unique to Rhabodontids: their dentary teeth have a central primary ridge with multiple equally spaced secondary ridges, and their maxillary teeth have no primary ridge and have similarly-sized secondary ridges.  Postcranium  Unique characteristics are found in the femur, the humerus, and the ulna bones. The femur has a non-pendant, crested . The humerus lacks a proximal bicipital sulcus, and a concave border between the head and the deltopectoral crest. The ulna has a large . Classification Comparison of rhabdodontid dentaries There are differing opinions as to the constituents of Rhabdodontidae. Originally they were defined as the last common ancestor of Zalmoxes robustus and Rhabdodon priscus. Later, Paul Sereno proposed a new definition, the most inclusive clade containing Rhabdodon priscus but not Parasaurolophus walkeri.Sereno, P.C. (2005). \\"Stem Archosauria Version 1.0.\\" TaxonSearch. Available: http://www.taxonsearch.org/Archive/stem- archosauria-1.0.php . Accessed 24 November 2010. More recently, a morphological diagnosis was proposed, that excluded Muttaburrasaurus, unlike Sereno's definition. The clade Rhabdodontomorpha was coined to contain the larger group. The following cladogram was recovered by Dieudonn√© and colleagues in 2016: Evolution Adult body sizes of Mochlodon, Zalmoxes and Rhabdodon. Rhabdodontids first appeared during the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous, and an extensive fossil record shows that they remained extant until the Maastrichtian stage at the end of the Late Cretaceous. During much of the Late Cretaceous, an isolated island habit in the western Tethyan archipelago contributed to the evolution of rhabdodontids in two main ways. First, the rhabdodontid dentition is relatively primitive, which is consistent with their habitat being sheltered from expansive mixing leading to a long period of dominance. Second, the fossil record contains three genera of rhabdodontids ‚Äì Mocholdon, Zalmoxes, and Rhabdodon ‚Äì that make up two geographically separated lines in the archipelago. Traditionally, it has been thought Mochlodon and Zalmoxes were insular dwarfs. The smaller sizes of Mocholodon (1.6 to 1.8 m) and Zalmoxes (2.0 to 2.5 m) relative to Rhabodon (5.0 to 6.0 m) and the island locale that all three genera shared led to the hypothesis of island nanism in the case of the former two. However, ≈êsi et al. (2012) proposed that Rhabdodon underwent gigantism on the mainland, as opposed to Zalmoxes and Mochlodon experiencing nanism on island habitats. √ñsi and colleagues used femur length to estimate body size through evolution in the rhabdodontid lineage. The conclusion was that in the eastern lineage comprising Zalmoxes and Mochlodon, the size ranges of both were too close to that of the ancestral rhabdodontid to support the hypothesis of nanism. √ñsi and colleagues instead came to the conclusion that Rhabdodon in the western lineage is a case of gigantism in the group Rhabdodontidae.  Relationship to other fauna  Rhabdodontids and Nodosaurids were overtaken by Hadrosaurids as the dominating herbivorous dinosaur group during the Maastrichtian period, 72.1‚Äì66.0 million years ago, of the Late Cretaceous. Titanosaurs coexisted with all of these groups throughout the Maastrichtian. Transylvania is the only location known thus far to have had Rhabdodontids, Nodosaurids, Titanosaurs, and Hadrosaurids all coexisting together.  Paleobiology  The Late Cretaceous is characterized by a warm temperate climate that extended to the poles, elevated sea levels, and inland seas. With a dentition adapted to shearing vegetation, members of the family Rhabododontidae were well-suited for life in the lush, vegetative environment at middle latitudes.

Biography Bryant was born in Atlanta in 1908, to Posey Milton Bryant and his wife Auroria, after spending nearly nine years working with Georgia fiddler Clayton McMichen as part of his band, the Georgia Wildcats, Bryant and most of the band separated from McMichen and moved to Pittsburgh in 1940 where he and the Georgia Wildcats became regulars on KDKA's new early morning Farm Hour. He had worked at the station previously in 1931 with McMichen and in 1937 with his own group the Georgia Wildcats after parting ways with McMichen. The Wildcats became a Pittsburgh institution during World War II; and in 1949, performed on the first television program to air in that city, a musical variety show broadcast live on WDTV from Syria Mosque in Pittsburgh's Oakland section. WDTV became KDKA in January 1955. Having worked with several female singers, they added vocalist Nancy Fingal to add a pop music flavor. There were no other guests. Fingal was, Slim says, \\"A very talented girl, singin' Sinatra tunes, that kind of stuff.\\" He was the last surviving musician to have recorded with the legendary country singer Jimmie Rodgers, who died in 1933. In 1932, Rodgers recorded Bryant's song \\"Mother, the Queen of My Heart\\", with Bryant accompanying him on guitar. Rodgers not only gave him writing credit, but had them list Bryant's name first, which is something many big stars refuse to do. He also recorded nine other songs with Rodgers. With his back-up group, the Wildcats, he wrote and recorded such novelty songs during his career as \\"Eeny Meeny Dixie Deeny\\", the closest he ever came to having a hit on the Billboard charts.

Life She was born in Leyton, Essex, the fifth of nine children. Her father was a watchmaker and later an undertaker. She left school at 12 to go into domestic service, working her way up to cook. She claimed that the great chef Auguste Escoffier, then at the Carlton Hotel, taught her about cooking. It was he who named her the \\"Queen of Cooks\\". One of her employers was Lady Randolph Churchill. One day, Rosa chased Lady Randolph's then ten-year-old, red-haired son Winston out of her kitchen, shouting \\"Hop it, copper knob.\\" She married butler Chiney Lewis in 1893. However, she did not think much of her husband. \\"My family said that if I did not marry Mr. Lewis they would shoot me. ... So we were married and I threw the ring at him at the church door and left him flat.\\" There are several versions describing how she met Edward VII. According to Time magazine, it was Lady Randolph who introduced them. However, the Cavendish Hotel biography states they first met while she was employed by Philippe, comte de Paris; he complimented her for the excellence of the dinner. In any case, he enjoyed her cooking very much. It was suspected by some that he helped her purchase the Cavendish Hotel in 1902. Another admirer of her culinary skills was Kaiser Wilhelm II, who presented her with his portrait. During World War I, she had it hung upside down in the men's toilet. In 1914 it was reported that she \\"cooked dinners for the regiments of the Household Cavalry... and at one time controlled the kitchen of White's Club\\", the latter a reference to White's \\"the oldest and most exclusive gentleman's club in London\\".

Suddenly caught by a stroke, she had been rushed to the London Clinic, where she refused to allow any of the nurses to touch her. After a week she saw the bill and immediately got up and left. :When we arrived, there she was, seventy-six years old, shrieking with laughter and waving a glass of champagne, apparently none the worse.

A non-age statement whiskey, containing a mix of pot still and grain whiskeys, it is matured for about twelve to twenty years in ex-bourbon American Oak barrels. One of the most expensive whiskeys regularly produced by Irish Distillers, since its launch in 1984, Midleton Very Rare has frequently been the recipient of strong reviews and awards. Each year, a new bottling is specially created by the Master Distiller at the Midleton Distillery, using whiskeys handpicked from the distillery's warehouses. Barry Crockett, the Master Distiller who created the whiskey, and oversaw its production until he retired in 2013, stated that his objective each year was \\"to produce the best whiskey possible\\". The fact that each vintage differs, and is only released in very limited quantities (typically less than 2,500 cases per annum), makes the whiskey both collectible and expensive. Each bottle is individually numbered and signed by the Master Distiller, and sold in an accompanying wooden display case. In recent years several single pot still whiskeys have been released under the Midleton banner alongside Midleton Very Rare. History In the mid-1970s, Irish Distillers which owned several distilleries in Ireland, decided to close most of their existing distilleries and to consolidate production at a new purpose-built facility in Midleton. Therefore, as the new distillery needed to replicate several different existing whiskeys it became home to a wide range of maturing whiskey stocks. In 1984, Midleton Very Rare was launched to celebrate the whiskeys produced in Midleton. As the new distillery had only been open for about a decade at that stage, the initial vintages contained whiskey from the neighbouring Old Midleton Distillery, which closed when the new distillery opened. However, the newer vintages are produced from whiskeys distilled in the new distillery.  Midleton variants  Bottles of Midleton Single CaskIn September 2014, to commemorate the 30th or Pearl anniversary of Midleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey, Midleton Distillery invited their Master Distiller Emeritus Barry Crockett out of retirement to join his successor and current Master Distiller Brian Nation in producing a special anniversary edition. The whiskey, Midleton Very Rare 30th Anniversary Pearl Edition, was a limited to just 117 bottles, and released at a higher strength (53.1% ABV) than the original. In addition to Midleton Very Rare (a blend), several single pot still whiskeys have been released under the Midleton banner throughout the years: * Midleton 25-year-old Pure Pot Still, 43% ABV, one-off bottling distilled in 1973, and matured in Oloroso butts * Midleton 26-year-old Pure Pot Still, 40% ABV, one-off bottling distilled in 1974, and released to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Old Midleton Distillery, matured in Oloroso butts, and finished for one-year in a Port pipe * Midleton 30-year old Pure Pot Still, 40% ABV, one-off bottling distilled in 1969 and released in 1999 * Midleton Single Cask, released in differing formats on several occasions * Midleton Dair Ghaelach, 57.9% ABV, 15-22 year old pot still whiskey matured in bourbon barrels, and finished for a year in virgin Irish oak barrels (a first for Irish whiskey) Recently, a Midleton single pot still variant was released as an ongoing bottling to celebrate the career of Barry Crockett, the former Master Distiller at Midleton. Crockett who retired after 47 years at the Midleton distilleries helped to formulate the whiskey himself: * Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy Single Pot Still, 46% ABV, matured mainly in Bourbon barrels, with a portion matured in virgin American Oak barrels. Reviews Midleton whiskey variants have received strong reviews from a number of sources over the years, for instance: * In 2016, Jim Murray, whiskey writer and author of the Whisky Bible rated Midleton Dair Ghaelach number three in his 2016 World Whiskeys of the Year. At the time, that was the highest position Murray had ever ranked an Irish whiskey. * In 2014, three Midleton variants scored above 90 points in Jim Murray's 2014 Whisky Bible (Midleton Single Pot Still Cask 1991 ‚Äì 96.5 points; Midleton Single Pot Still Single Cask 1994 ‚Äì 93 points; Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy ‚Äì 94 points).

King Ibn Saud was being influenced by Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso of Venezuela who cut a similar 50/50 deal with New Jersey Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell. This 50/50 deal accorded the American oil companies a tax break equivalent to 50% of their profits on oil sales, with the other 50% to be diverted to King Ibn Saud via the US Treasury. The King agreed to this 50/50 splitting of Aramco's oil profits instead of nationalizing Aramco's oil facilities on Saudi soil.

It was signed into law by President George Washington on March 22, 1794. This was the first of several anti-slavery trade-acts of Congress. Federal outlawing of importation of slaves to the United States was enacted in 1807. The domestic trade and owning of slaves would not become illegal in the entire U.S. until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865. Passage The bill was introduced during the 3rd Congress that happened December 2, 1793. This bill was then passed March 22, 1794, with the title: An Act to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade from the United States to any foreign place or country. Text of the law > Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the > United States of America in Congress assembled, That no citizen or citizens > of the United States, or foreigner, or any other person coming into, or > residing within the same, shall, for himself or any other person whatsoever, > either as master, factor or owner, build, fit, equip, load or otherwise > prepare any ship or vessel, within any port or place of said United States, > nor shall cause any ship or vessel to sail from any port or place within > same, for the purpose of carrying on any trade or traffic in slaves, to any > foreign country; or for the purpose of procuring, from any foreign kingdom, > place or country, the inhabitants of such kingdom, place or country, to be > transported to any foreign country, port, or place whatever, to be sold or > disposed of, as slaves: And if any ship or vessel shall be so fitted out, as > aforesaid, for the said purposes, or shall be caused to sail, so as > aforesaid, every ship or vessel, her tackle, furniture, apparel and other > appurtenances, shall be forfeited to the United States; and shall be liable > to be seized, prosecuted and condemned, in any of the circuit courts or > district court for the district where said ship or vessel may be found and > seized. Section 2 allows for forfeiture by owners and the possibility of a $2,000 fine. Section 3 affected foreign merchants. Section 4 forfeited any slaves on board the ship and a fine of $200 per slave. In short, the Act limited the international slave trade to foreign ships, and foreign ships using United States' ports had to agree not to export from U.S. ports. First prosecution In August 1795, Providence, Rhode Island merchant John Brown conspired to trade in slaves.Charles Rappleye, Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution (2006) excerpt Brown conspired with a Captain Peleg Wood with the ship to be used in the slave trade. By November Hope was engaged in the slave trade, and in March 1796, the owners of the ship were fined by Rhode Island the amount of ¬£200 for trading in slaves, which had been outlawed in that state. On a voyage in 1796 Brown's ship traveled to Havana, Cuba with 229 slaves. This trading voyage led to a trial of Brown in 1796 for violating the statute. Brown became the first American tried in federal court under the Slave Trade Act of 1794. On October 5, 1797, Brown lost his case and was forced to forfeit the ship in accordance with the law.Papers of the American Slave Trade. Retrieved on February 20, 2007.

It is a non-religious, non-profit, non-political organization, led by Darrell Scott and his wife Sandy.Rachel's Tears, p. 181. Rachel Scott was the first student killed in the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. Darrell Scott, Rachel's father, established Rachel's Challenge to perpetuate his daughter's example and the two-page \\"Code of Ethics\\" she wrote a month before her death at the hands of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. This code of ethics had included the words: \\"Compassion is the greatest form of love humans have to offer\\", and Darrell Scott has stated his belief in this message forms the basis for what he both speaks at public appearances, and has written as an author. The Rachel‚Äôs Challenge presentations are given in schools and communities by members of her family and other speakers, using video footage of the Columbine High School massacre and its aftermath, combined with Rachel Scott‚Äôs drawings and writings, in a campaign to quell school violence, bullying, and teen suicide. As of 2009, Rachel's Challenge has developed a team of 30 speakers addressing young people in schools and colleges worldwide about Rachel's example. The Rachel's Challenge program includes establishing Friends of Rachel clubs in schools, following the initial presentation, to sustain the campaign's goals on a long-term basis.Friends of Rachel program, 2008 Schools around the country have incorporated Rachel's challenge into their own clubs bringing the message to their students. Darrell Scott Darrell Scott has co-authored three books about his daughter's life and her impact, urging students to practice compassion and kindness. Newsweek reported that he and the organization have \\"reached out to thousands of schools to deliver a 'chain reaction' of hope through school assemblies, workshops and outreach programs.\\"Bennett, Jessica. \\"Celebrate Their Lives\\", Newsweek, 4 October 2006. Scott told Newsweek, \\"...principals and teachers always need to be on the lookout for that kid who's isolated, or that's quiet, who always stays to himself, because that's typically the type of kid who ends up exploding. They also need to create an atmosphere in the school where students share with someone if they ever hear or see a threat. We know there have been numerous school shootings prevented because a student saw another student writing that he wanted to kill someone or something like that. I think that taking every single threat of any kind seriously is of utmost importance, and again to me it's cultivating an atmosphere, a climate and a culture where everyone's accepted. Because when people feel accepted they're not going to do something like Eric and Dylan [the Columbine perpetrators] did.\\" Craig Scott Rachel Scott‚Äôs younger brother Craig, a 16-year-old Columbine High School sophomore at the time of the shootings, was physically unharmed but witnessed several classmates being killed in the school library as he huddled under a table with two friends, Isaiah Shoels and Matthew Kechter‚Äîboth of whom were among the fatalities. The next day, he was interviewed at length by Katie Couric on the Today show. The tearful interview, which NBC did not interrupt with normally scheduled station breaks, was described a year later by USA Today as \\"one of the most indelible moments of the tragedy\\". Craig wrote of his sister Rachel, \\"...her love for people was less conditional than anyone I knew... It didn't matter to her what you looked like or who your friends were. Another thing I liked and respected so much was that she made it clear... what her beliefs were\\".Rachel's Tears, p. 136. Craig continues to make frequent speaking appearances on behalf of Rachel's Challenge, urging teens to strive for a classroom \\"atmosphere of kindness and compassion\\" to stem school violence.\\"A Columbine Survivor Urges the Virginia Tech Community to Stay Positive\\", The Oprah Winfrey Show, April 18, 2007.

We've seen bullying stopped, incidents where a student came up with hit lists or plans to shoot up his school, and told either the speaker or told the teacher about their plans, but had a change of heart. How have we done it? We've done it with a simple story of a young girl who believed in compassion, Rachel Joy Scott. But my sister is not the only one who believes in kindness, and she's not been the only one in her brave stance against the injustice willing to stand up for the one who gets put down in school, to sit by the student that sits all alone at lunch, and to talk to or reach out to the one who is consistently ignored or made fun of. She literally has inspired millions of people to continue the chain reaction she started...\\".News release, Conference on School Safety, White House, 10 October 2006. In the aftermath of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech shooting, Darrell and Craig Scott were interviewed on various television programs, such as Showbiz Tonight, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Fox & Friends, and Geraldo at Large, to share their thoughts about school violence and to remember Rachel Scott near the eighth anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. Craig Scott urged viewers on The Oprah Winfrey Show two days later to refrain from too much focus on the shooter, saying \\"I have found students that actually idolize the two shooters at Columbine... We've focused on my sister, who's so compassionate and kind. And from that, that's the opposite of that anger and hatred.\\" On April 20, 2009, the tenth anniversary of the Columbine shootings, Darrell Scott told NBC interviewer Natalie Morales on the Today show, \\"We've seen a lot of lives changed from her story and our program, Rachel's Challenge, has touched literally 13 million lives over the last ten years\\". He said that from September 2008 to April 2009, his organization received 105 emails from teens dissuaded from suicide because of attending a Rachel's Challenge program. In a separate interview aired the same day, Craig Scott told Morales that, \\"I meet a lot of hurting students out there and I share with them my hurtful story, but I'm not just carrying a sob story around ... I'm trying to share with them some of the things that I learned to get through it and to be a better person because of it\\". As of 2008, Craig Scott has spoken to more than one million people in making appearances for Rachel's Challenge, while pursuing a career in filmmaking. He hopes to produce inspirational films and is on the board of directors of the American Screenwriters Association.

Early life and career  Crawford was born in Doonside, New South Wales, the son of Robert Crawford senior, and was educated at The King's School, Parramatta, and the University of Sydney. Crawford settled on a farm as his forefathers had done, but not being successful, became a clerk in Sydney and afterwards had a typewriting business. Some of Crawford's poems were published in The Bulletin and other periodicals. Crawford is believed to have been the first prize-winning haiku poet published in Australia, in The Bulletin on 12 August 1899.Haiku history in Australia In 1904 a small collection, Lyric Moods:Various Verses, was published in Sydney. An enlarged edition was later published in Melbourne retitled simply Lyric Moods (1909). In 1921 another volume, Leafy Bliss, was published, and an enlarged edition appeared three years later. Not a great deal is known about Crawford; he was short of stature, poetical in spirit. He mixed little in literary circles and seems to be forgotten a few years after his death. The statement that he was educated at The King's School originally appeared in The Bookfellow, and may have come direct from Crawford. If so there is no reason to doubt it, yet in the records of The King's School of his period the only R. Crawford is listed as Richard Crawford. It was also not possible to identify him positively with the Robert James G. W. Crawford who graduated B.A. at the University of Sydney in 1912, when the poet was about 44 years of age. Crawford is represented in some of the anthologies, and A. G. Stephens thought highly of his work. His work has a delicate charm and, though at times one fears it will not rise above merely pretty verse, in some of his quatrains and lyrics Crawford does succeed in writing poetry of importance. Perhaps, as Stephens once suggested, he may be better appreciated in the 21st century.  Death  Crawford died suddenly at Lindfield, Sydney, on 13 January 1930.

History  The .223 WSSM was introduced in 2003 by the Browning Arms Company, Winchester Ammunition, and Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The .223 designation is a reference to the popular .223 Remington. It is currently claimed to be the fastest production .22 caliber round in the world with muzzle velocities as high as 4,600 feet per second (1,402 meters per second), but this is not completely true. The .220 Swift still holds the record as the fastest .22 caliber centerfire cartridge with a published velocity of 4665 fps using a 29 grain projectile and 42 grains of 3031 powder.  Complaints  Even before the cartridge was commercially introduced, it was claimed that it would be extremely hard on barrels and high wear would lead to short barrel life. Another criticism is that, although the round is suited for long range varmint hunting, it is not good for medium game any farther than 200 yards. The Winchester made Model 70 in .223 WSSM has not been revived in the new Browning-made Winchester Model 70s, but Browning has chosen to use chrome-lined barrels on all of its guns chambered for .223 WSSM and has introduced the .223 WSSM cartridge as a chambering in its A-bolt rifles. Browning rejects the charge that the .223 WSSM round is especially hard on barrels: \\"The 223 and 243 WSSM cartridges are said to 'burn up' barrels in as little as 300 rounds. Nothing could be further from the truth.\\" Advantages According to Browning, the .223 WSSM offers a gain with a bullet over the standard .223 Rem. It also offers a gain over the .22-250, a popular varmint round. This comes out to a gain over a standard .223 Rem, and a gain over the .22-250.

He was a Chancellor of the Song dynasty in Chinese history. He is widely regarded as a traitor for his part in the persecution and execution of his political enemy, Yue Fei, a general who fought for the Song against the Jin dynasty during the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars, resulting him being condemned by later generations of being corrupt. Modern historians, however, have placed as much blame (if not more) on the reigning Emperor Gaozong himself.ÁôºÁèæÁß¶Ê™úÈÅ∫ÂõëÂæå ËÄÉÂè§ÈöäÂêëÁß¶Ê™úÁ£ïÈ†≠ He was also nicknamed \\"Long-legged Qin\\" () by the people out of scorn. Life Born in Jiangning (present days Nanjing, Jiangsu), Qin won Jinshi in the Imperial examination of 1115. During the Northern Song dynasty, Qin was an activist against the invasion by the Jin dynasty in the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars. He was captured along with Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong in the Jingkang Incident. Some years later, he suddenly returned from captivity in the Jin empire to the capital of Emperor Gaozong. He claimed some sort of miraculous escape but quite some people expressed doubt regarding his story. However, he quickly won the emperor's favor and became the Chancellor of the Southern Song empire in 1131. In the next year, he was removed from the position after impeachment. After some Song victories in 1137, the Jin empire was forced to reopen peace talks, and Qin gained power as a pacifist. With Qin's help, the emperor suppressed the war hawks and signed the Treaty of Shaoxing with the Jin empire. The emperor basically accepted the status of being a vassal of the Jin empire publicly. To open the peace talks, the national hero general Yue Fei, who was famous for his military successes against the Jurchen people, was framed by Qin and his accomplices for disobedience and treason. Yue was soon removed from his position, arrested and executed in prison. Murdering Yue Fei is one of the most infamous evil acts by a government minister in the whole history of the Song dynasty. Qin became notorious, and (after he lost power and died) some people suspected that he was a traitor. Qin removed all his political opponents from the government by use of his control over the Imperial Censorate. Most of his enemies were exiled far to the south, several in fact died on Hainan Island. He believed that schools should only teach \\"acceptable ideas\\" and practiced a strong form of censorship and thought control over the Imperial University. After Emperor Gaozong's resignation, the new Emperor Xiaozong of Song pardoned most of Qin's political enemies, including a posthumous pardon for Yue Fei. From that point on, Qin was constantly vilified by Chinese historians. He became one of the most important examples in Chinese history of an evil minister. Cultural echo The Story of Yue Fei states that after having Yue Fei, Yue Yun, and Zhang Xian arrested on false charges, Qin and his wife, Lady Wang (), were sitting by the \\"eastern window\\", warming themselves by the fire, when he received a letter from the people calling for the release of the general. Qin was worried because, after nearly two months of torture, he could not get Yue Fei to admit the false charges of treason and would eventually have to let him go. However, after a servant girl brought fresh oranges into the room, Lady Wang devised a plan to execute the general. She told Qin to slip an execution notice inside the skin of an orange and send it to the examining judge. This way, the general and his companions would be put to death before the Emperor or Qin himself would have to rescind an open order of execution.Qian, Cai. General Yue Fei. Trans. Honorable Sir T.L.

In the novel, The Monkey King faces a representation of his own carnal desires and is trapped inside of a tower full of mirrors, each with its own powers. One mirror causes him to travel forward in time, from the Tang to the Song dynasty. There, some junior devils appear and tell him that the ruler of the underworld King Yama has recently died of an illness, and so Monkey must take his place until a suitable replacement can be found. Monkey ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister Qin Hui. He tortures Qin into confessing his sins. These tortures include having millions of embroidery needles shoved into his flesh, being ground into paste, thrown onto a mountain of swords and spears, hacked into bits, forced to drink human pus, and his rib cage ripped apart to give him the appearance of a dragon fly. A demon is charged with using his magic breath to \\"blow\\" Qin back into his proper form. Monkey finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone, who speaks before it, inside, and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this gourd for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. (He claims this completes his lessons on the three religions since: 1) the immortal Subhodi taught him Taoist magic 2) the monk Tang Sanzang taught him Buddhist restraint and 3) Yue Fei taught him Confucian ideals.) He entertains Yue Fei until Qin has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of Qin's \\"blood wine.\\" Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the \\"gate of ghosts,\\" presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him.Dong, Yue, Shuen-fu Lin, Larry James Schulz, and Cheng·∫ªn Wu.

Qin Hui the Stinker The following is a folktale about one of Qin's descendants: During the Ming dynasty, the new Provincial Governor-General of Hangzhou, who was a direct descendant of Qin and Madam Wang, had both iron statues thrown into the West Lake under cover of night. The next day, the lake turned pitch-black and smelt of vomit. The townsfolk realized that the lake‚Äôs condition coincided with the statues' disappearance. When Official Qin arrived on the scene, the people questioned him about his relationship with Qin. Because he knew the statues had sunk to the bottom of the lake, he boasted, \\"If anyone can really scoop the statues out of the lake, this official is waiting to resign and ask for punishment.\\" At that exact moment, the murky water became clear, and the statues drifted ashore as if propelled by an invisible force. The cowardly official bolted for his sedan when he saw this miraculous sight. The townsfolk pelted his sedan with rocks as he fled, many of them ripping through the curtain, giving him huge lumps on his head. That night, Official Qin escaped Hangzhou, never to be heard from again. Listen to this Story The mad monk sweeps Qin out of the temple 'Qin Hui encounters the Monk of the Wind' from the Tale of the Eastern Window novel. During the Southern Song dynasty there were two famous Buddhists named the \\"Crazy monk\\" Ji Gong and the \\"Mad Monk\\" Fengbo. Fengbo lived during the time of Yue Fei and became famous for \\"Sweeping Qin Hui‚Äôs face with a broom\\". The story is told after having Yue Fei imprisoned on false charges, Qin went to the Lingyin Temple to have his fortune read. There he was confronted by a laughing Feng Bo who asked, \\"Cao Cao was once a big hero, but where is he today?\\" The Prime Minister asked him what he meant in confusion. Fengbo said, : \\"The principles of heaven are clear. Loyalty and treachery are self-evident. Goodness and evil will be met by reward or retribution. You, as the Prime Minister, hold a lot of power. Why do you want to murder a man who is as important to the country as a pillar of a house? Does the safety of the nation mean nothing to you?\\" Qin countered, \\"Who is that pillar of the country?\\" \\"General Yue Fei!\\" screamed Fengbo. When Qin seemed unaffected by his words, Fengbo laughed and said, \\"What a fool! Repent now before it is too late.\\" He then grabbed a broom and raked it across the Prime Minister‚Äôs face and quickly ran off. Feeling embarrassed, Qin returned to the palace a defeated man. The boldness of the monk caught the attention of the common folk. It is said he would appear in crowded areas and begin to sweep the floor, even in the cleanest of places, and proclaim \\"sweeping Qin\\" as a reminder to the people that they should band together to eliminate the traitor Qin from office. The \\"Mad Monk\\" was later raised to the level of Arahat. The statues of the \\"Mad and Crazy Monks\\" were often seen together in various temples throughout the Southern Song dynasty. There are two such statues of these arahats in the Da Xiong Temple Hall of Zhan Tan Forest on the Jiu Hua Mountain. One of them is the \\"Crazy Monk\\" Ji Gong in the form of a deity and the other is the \\"Mad Monk\\" Fengbo holding a duster in one hand and a broom under his left armpit, standing ever ready to give the wicked Prime Minister another sweep.An Allusion from History: A Buddhist Monk Feng Bo Upholds Righteousness This is a derivative of an episode from The Story of Yue Fei, which mentions no \\"sweeping\\" at all. The fortuneteller's name was \\"Xie Renfu of Chengdu\\" and he told the fortunes of both Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui, who were in disguise, in the Dragon's Intonation Monastery. When Qin returned to the palace, he sent men to arrest the fortuneteller, but he had already fled the city, out of fear once he discovered who they really were.

During World War I he was a doctor of colonial troops, receiving the Croix de Guerre in 1916. From 1917 to 1920 he was a physician in charge of the bacteriology laboratory at the hospital in Diego-Suarez. In 1922 he was appointed director of the Institute of Bacteriology of Madagascar (Institut Pasteur of Antananarivo), a position he maintained until 1940.. During his tenure in Madagascar, Girard conducted studies of typhoid, tuberculosis, leprosy and especially bubonic plague. Beginning in 1898 there had been sporadic outbreaks of the plague in the country, and none of the previously developed vaccines were strong or durable enough to handle the disease. In the 1930s, Girard and his assistant, Jean Robic developed an anti-plague vaccine known as the \\"EV strain\\". The EV strain had excellent results against the plague, and inoculation was carried out by Colonial Army medical officers and auxiliary Malagasy physicians. For decades afterwards this strain has been used worldwide to combat bubonic plague. In 1941 he succeeded Edouard Dujardin-Beaumetz (1868-1947) as director of plague services at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

His son also named William Cowper was later the Dean of Sydney. Early life Cowper was born at Whittington, Lancashire, the son of a yeoman farmer. At 17 years of age, Cowper became a tutor in a cleric's family. Later he was a clerk in the royal engineer's department at Hull. He was ordained in March 1808 and became a curate in Rawdon near Hull. There he was found by the Reverend Samuel Marsden who induced him to come to Australia. Australia Early in 1808 Rev. Samuel Marsden, in search of two additional chaplains, came to Cowper's parish and invited him to accept appointment. He was willing and received a commission as an assistant chaplain in New South Wales at a salary of ¬£260. His departure from England was delayed by the death of his wife, then the mother of three sons, including Charles, later a leading politician, and one daughter. Cowper married Ann Barrell, and sailed with his family to Port Jackson, arriving in August 1809. He took up duties as minister of St Philip's Church, then being completed. For the first ten years of his ministry, he was the only clergyman permanently in Sydney. Cowper arrived at Sydney on 18 August 1809 and became an assistant chaplain. He was also incumbent of St Phillip's Church (the name was spelt this way in honour of the first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip). He found the state of morality in Sydney deplorable and actively set to work by preaching and, by example, to bring about an improvement. He was one of the founders and secretary of the Benevolent Society of New South Wales and was at one time the secretary of six religious and charitable societies. In 1842 Cowper's eyesight began to fail; he obtained leave of absence to go to London to have an operation and was presented with a purse of ¬£780 by his parishioners to cover his expenses. He returned in 1843 with his sight much improved and with a Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity which had been conferred on him by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1848 Cowper was instrumental in starting the building of the new church of St Philip and gave ¬£500 towards the cost of it. In 1849 he had a dangerous illness but recovered, and in 1852 was appointed to administer the diocese during the absence of Bishop Broughton on a visit to England. The bishop died in February 1853 and Cowper had to continue his duties until Bishop Barker arrived in May 1855. Late life The new church of St Philip was sufficiently complete to be consecrated in March 1856, much to Cowper's joy. He died on 6 July 1858. He was married three times and was survived by four sons and two daughters. Two of his sons, Sir Charles Cowper and William Macquarie Cowper, are noticed separately. Cowper was devoted to his work. He several times refused to become a magistrate because he considered the duties incompatible with his clerical life. The burden of Cowper's clerical and official duties took their toll. In 1812 he had suffered from some form of rheumatic fever, probably contracted in the gaols, and his slow recovery marked the beginning of a life of constant ill health. Reports of this ill health were made in 1818 and 1829 by William Grant Broughton, Marsden and Darling, but it was not until February 1842 that the formation of cataracts on both eyes compelled him to take leave and return to England for treatment. The loss in 1831 of his second wife, mother of William Macquarie Cowper, had also told on him. On 1 March 1836 he had married Harriette Swaine, to whom were born two further children. The address of farewell and appreciation presented to him on his departure from Sydney by his parishioners and the citizens of Sydney revealed the esteem in which he was held, and the gift that went with it paid all the expenses of his journey to England. The treatment of his eyes seems to have been entirely successful and he was able to return to his duties. While in England he received a Lambeth D.D. In 1848 Bishop Broughton collated him to the archdeaconry of Cumberland. References *N. S.

Retrieved 13 April 2010 Early life Coppin was born at Steyning, Sussex, England, son of George Selth Coppin (1794‚Äì1854), a Norwich surgeon, and Elizabeth Jane, n√©e Jackson. His grandfather had been a well-known clergyman at Norwich. George Selth Coppin Senior studied for the medical profession, but abandoned this to join a group of travelling actors. George Coppin Junior (he rarely used his middle name, Selth) became an assistant in his father's company; George and his sister performed their own act by 1826. At the age of 18 Coppin had an engagement at the Woolwich theatre, and soon afterwards was playing at Richmond, where he became low comedian at a salary of twenty-five shillings a week. He next obtained an engagement at the Queen's Theatre, London, and in subsequent years played as first low comedian in the provinces and at Abbey Street theatre, Dublin, where he had a long acting engagement. There Coppin met Maria Watkins Burroughs, nine years older than Coppin. They lived together from 1842 to 1848. Australia Milky White Coppin decided to leave England in search of other opportunities; a coin toss meant he sailed for Australia, not America, towards the end of 1842, arriving in Sydney on 10 March 1843. Coppin negotiated with Joseph Wyatt and had a successful season at the Royal Victoria Theatre. Coppin bought a hotel but, being quite inexperienced, lost his money and went to Hobart, Tasmania in January 1845. At Launceston he formed a company, recruited George Herbert Rogers, and in June 1845 took it to Melbourne and opened at the Queen's Theatre, recently built by John Thomas Smith. In August 1846, Coppin went to Adelaide, converted a billiard room into the New Queen's Theatre with a 700-seat capacity, and on 2 November 1846 began his season with The King and the Comedian, Coppin playing the part of Stolbach (the comedian). Coppin subsequently played a variety of parts including Sir Peter Teazle, Jacques Strop in Robert Macaire, Jemmy Twitcher in The Golden Farmer, Don Caesar in Don Caesar de Bazan and many others in forgotten plays. In 1848 Coppin transferred the management of the theatre to John Lazar. Coppin and Lazar refurbished the old Queen's Theatre which, renamed \\"Royal Victoria Theatre\\", opened on 23 December 1850 and enjoyed great popularity, which lasted until the Theatre Royal opened in 1868. Around 1850 Coppin built Semaphore Hotel (and thereby gave that suburb its name) and the \\"White Horse Cellars\\", an hotel and theatre in Port Adelaide, later owned by William Knapman. Coppin suffered losses in his copper-mining investments and with the exodus of his hotel and playhouse patrons to the Victorian diggings, he became insolvent. He left Adelaide for Victoria in December 1851, tried his fortunes briefly as a gold-digger without success, began playing at Geelong, then returned to Adelaide in 1853 to pay his creditors \\"20 shillings in the pound\\" (i.e. in full). Still in 1853, Coppin visited England where he acted in the provinces. There he met Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, engaged a company, and returned to Australia bringing with them an iron theatre in sections which was erected in Melbourne as the Princess Theatre. Brooke was to establish a great reputation in Australia. In July 1855 Coppin was playing Colonel Damas with him in The Lady of Lyons, and about this time they became partners. They purchased Melbourne's Theatre Royal and the Cremorne Gardens a pleasure garden on the banks of the Yarra River at Richmond in Melbourne, Australia, and spent ¬£60,000 on them. In 1859 Coppin imported six camels from Aden as exhibits for the Cremorne Gardens menagerie and in 1860 he sold them for ¬£300 to the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria who used them on the Burke and Wills expedition. The partnership of Brooks and Coppin was dissolved in 1859 and Coppin, having become security for a large sum in connection with the Melbourne and Suburban railway, was in financial difficulties again. The line was sold and he became freed from his liability. In 1862 he built the Haymarket Theatre on the south side of Bourke Street, and in 1863 Mr and Mrs Charles Kean played a season there. Coppin initially made his reputation as an actor but, after he had been a few years in Australia, management took up increasing amounts of his time. He was a comedian, who starred in parts like Paul Pry, Bob Acres, and Lancelot Gobbo. He also played Aminadab Sleek in The Serious Family, Mawworm in The Hypocrite and Tony Lumpkin. James Smith, a critic of his time, spoke of his success in presenting \\"the ponderous stolidity and impenetrable stupidity of certain types of humanity‚Äîthe voice, the gait, the movements, the expression of the actor's features, were all in perfect harmony with the mental and moral idiosyncrasies of the person he represented, so that the man himself stood before you a living reality\\". In 1864 Coppin again lost his money and went to the United States. At a farewell dinner he was presented with a cheque for ¬£300 and was given a public reception when he returned in 1866. He joined Messrs. Harwood, Stewart and Hennings in the management of the Theatre Royal chain, and, although they lost heavily at times, Coppin's record from this point is one of increasing prosperity. In 1869 Coppin purchased the historical property Invergorwiehttps://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/574 in Hawthorn in Melbourne's inner east, and soon subdivided the large landholdings, establishing two streets through the area, namely Coppin Grove and Shakespeare Grove.https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coppin+Grove,+Hawthorn+VIC+3122/@-37.8221515,145.0150788,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad6424542bcd761:0x9cd3dfd913eeb021!8m2!3d-37.8221515!4d145.0172675 (The joke has often been made that Coppin named the two streets after his two favourite thespians.)

He was an active Freemason from his stay in Adelaide until his death. He played a key role in the formation of the Grand Lodge of Victoria in 1883, of which he became Grand Master. The Coppin Masonic Lodge in East Brunswick bears his name as does Coppin Hall at the Royal Freemasons Homes Political career In April 1858 Coppin began to take an interest in public affairs ‚Äî he became a councillor in the Richmond municipality, and in October 1858 was elected for the South Western Province in the Victorian Legislative Council for a term of five years. In 1859 he brought in a transfer of property bill which was passed in the Council and rejected in the Assembly. Three years later it became law, James Service taking charge of it in the assembly, and Coppin in the council. This measure (often referred to as the \\"Torrens Act\\" for R. R. Torrens, who promoted it) has proved to be a very valuable one. Coppin resigned from the Council in February 1863. Coppin was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for East Melbourne in May 1874 and did useful work; for example, he established post office savings banks. Coppin was opposed to the payment of members of Parliament, and when the act passed to pay them, he gave his salary to charities. Coppin retired from theatrical management on 28 June 1882, but remained a member of the Legislative Assembly until losing his seat in March 1889. Soon after, in August 1889, he was elected as member for Melbourne Province in the Victorian Legislative Council, holding this seat until August 1895. Later life Coppin took an interest in the development of Sorrento, Victoria where he had a seaside home, and kept up his connection with the Old Colonists' Association (which he had founded), the Humane Society, Gordon House and other institutions. When managing the Cremorne Gardens he had brought out the first balloon to ascend in Melbourne, and was responsible for the acclimatization of English thrushes and white swans. He was also the first to suggest the value of camels for the Australian interior. He died early in the morning of 14 March 1906, aged 86. He was married twice, firstly in August 1855 to Harriet Hilsden n√©e Bray (Gustavus Brooke's sister-in-law, died 2 September 1859), and then on 4 June 1861 to her daughter Lucy Hilsden, who survived him with their two sons and five daughters. Two of the three daughters of his first marriage also survived Coppin. His daughter Blanche Brooke Coppin married George Rossi Ashton (born 1857), a well-known black-and-white artist and brother of Julian Ashton, in Melbourne on 23 October 1883. A bronze plaque to Coppin's memory was unveiled at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, on 26 March 1939. He is there described as \\"Philanthropist and Father of the Theatre in Victoria\\". A well-received biography Coppin the Great : father of the Australian theatre, written by Alec Bagot was published by Melbourne University Press in 1965.

It originated as \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\", a 1951 song by Lil' Son Jackson, itself inspired by earlier blues. Renditions by Muddy Waters and B.B. King made the song well-known. When B.B. King's recording of \\"Rock Me Baby\\" was released in 1964, it became his first single to reach the Top 40 in Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart. Earlier songs B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby\\" is based on the 1951 song \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\" by Lil' Son Jackson. King's lyrics are nearly identical to Jackson's, although instrumentally the songs are different: \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\" is a solo piece, with Jackson's vocal and guitar accompaniment, whereas \\"Rock Me Baby\\" is an ensemble piece. Muddy Waters' song \\"Rock Me\\", recorded in 1956, is also based on Jackson's song. Some of Jackson's lyrics were used, but Waters incorporated a couple of verses from his 1951 song \\"All Night Long\\" (that is also based on \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\"). Muddy Waters' version also uses Jackson's guitar figure and the starting of the vocal on the IV chord and he interpreted it as an unusual fifteen-bar blues (an uneven number of measures, rather than the traditional twelve bars or somewhat less common eight or sixteen bars). Muddy Waters recorded a second version of \\"Rock Me\\" for his 1978 album I'm Ready. Lil' Son Jackson's \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\" was inspired by earlier blues songs. Many songs from the 1920s through the 1940s have some combination of rock, roll, baby, and mama in the title or lyrics, although instrumentally they are different than \\"Rock Me Baby\\", \\"Rock Me\\", or \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\". Big Bill Broonzy's 1940 song \\"Rockin' Chair Blues\\" serves as the basis for several renditions and makes frequent use of the phrase \\"rock me baby\\" as in \\"Rock me baby now, rock me slow ... now rock me baby, one time before you go\\". Arthur Crudup's 1944 song, \\"Rock Me Mama\\", is also based on Broonzy's song and repeats the same refrain, but uses \\"mama\\" in place of \\"baby\\". \\"Roll Me Mama\\", a 1939 song by Curtis Jones shares a couple of phrases (\\"like a wagon wheel\\", \\"ain't got no bone\\") with \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\". B.B. King song \\"Rock Me Baby\\" is a medium-tempo twelve-bar blues notated in the key of C in common or time. King's guitar fills are a key feature of the song, leading to its appeal to guitarists. The piano part is also prominent. Kent part-owner Joe Bihari recalled the pianist as King's frequent collaborator Maxwell Davis, although others have been suggested, such as Lloyd Glenn and Jimmy McCracklin. There is some confusion as to when B.B. King recorded \\"Rock Me Baby\\". Although King had signed to ABC-Paramount Records on January 14, 1962, his former label, Kent Records, continued to release singles (and albums) well into the 1970s. Recording dates have been estimated as \\"about 1958\\" to before 1962. The song was released shortly after King's Paramount release \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" in 1964 and reached number 34 in the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Rock Me Baby\\" was the first of six B.B. King records to reach the Top 40. In 1997, King re-recorded the song with Eric Clapton for the album Deuces Wild. Influence Over the years, many blues and other artists have interpreted and recorded \\"Rock Me Baby\\" and it has become a blues standard. Although Lil' Son Jackson's 1951 \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\" serves as the basis for many versions, B.B. King's and Muddy Waters' renditions are credited for making it well-known.

To this day, the last prayer by John Clarkson at Freetown can be found in the houses of Creoles and other Sierra Leoneans alike. To the Nova Scotians, 'Governor Clarkson' was both 'Father' and their 'Moses' who delivered them into the promised land. Early Life and Career in the Navy Clarkson was the second son of Rev.

He was born in the Headmaster's house and, despite the early death of his father, continued to attend the school until 1777 when, aged 12, he entered the Royal Navy as a \\"young gentleman\\" on Captain Joshua Rowley's ship, . He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1783.Hugh Brogan, \\"Clarkson, Thomas (1760‚Äì1846)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; accessed 4 Nov 2010. He served primarily in the Caribbean and observed at first hand the brutality and inhumanity of the slave trade. Initially unmoved by what he had witnessed he later, likely influenced by his brother Thomas‚Äô passionate views concerning the immorality of slavery, came to abhor the institution and rendered practical assistance to the cause of abolition. Mission to America The gravestone of Lawrence Hartshorne, a Quaker who was the chief assistant of John Clarkson in Nova Scotia. His brother Thomas, along with William Wilberforce and other members of the Committee for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, had incorporated the Sierra Leone Company with a view to resettling certain free and formerly enslaved blacks on the west coast of Africa. Lieutenant Clarkson's charge was to secure among black communities of Nova Scotia, Canada, volunteers to settle in the area of the mouth of the Sierra Leone River. The blacks in Nova Scotia were chiefly former African-American slaves relocated there after the Revolutionary War known as Black Loyalists. They had escaped to the British and fought with them to secure their own freedom. The British promised resettlement, land and provisions for the first year. Despite promises from the military, the settlements were underfunded, and authorities tended to favor white Loyalists, especially those from the South who had brought slaves with them to Nova Scotia, complicating the social situation. They competed with the freedmen for land and power. After arriving in Nova Scotia from England in October 1791, Clarkson worked with the Black Loyalist leader Thomas Peters and gathered a group of close to 1,200 African Nova Scotians who wanted to leave for better opportunities in Sierra Leone.Clarkson, Clarkson‚Äôs mission to America, 1791‚Äì1792, ed. and intro. C. B. Fergusson Some wanted to return home, having been kidnapped and enslaved from Africa as children. They departed in fifteen ships for Africa late in the year, meeting terrible conditions at sea. After a harrowing transatlantic passage in winter, the flotilla of 15 ships arrived in Sierra Leone in March 1792. The Africans from Nova Scotia, who became known as the Nova Scotian Settlers, established Freetown. Clarkson remained at the settlement until returning to England at the end of December 1792. He served as governor from August 1792 until his departure. The founding of Freetown and Governor of Sierra Leone The records of the settlers confirm Clarkson as a conscientious, supportive, reasonable and fair administrator. Clarkson was universally respected by the Settlers and even among the Creole people, Governor Clarkson is remembered as a fair administrator. Clarkson was one of the most popular governors of Sierra Leone and was universally respected by the Nova Scotians. From his work with the settlers in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, he grew to have great respect for them and struggled to ensure the company representatives did not take advantage of them. His advocacy for the settlers upon his return to England and recrimination of the company's actions, or lack thereof, resulted in his final dismissal by the company. Clarkson had submitted objections to the company's actions which were inconsistent with the representations and assurances he had made to the settlers. Clarkson never returned to Freetown but he received settlers who traveled to England to fight for their rights in the colony. They succeeded in carving out a political community and rights for themselves even with governors who were much less flexible than Clarkson. Death and legacy Clarkson died on 2 April 1828 in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's.Parish Burial records The unassuming Clarkson's last words in reaction to a report of the unrelenting abuse of slaves in the West Indies were reported to be, \\"It is dreadful to think, after my brother and his friends have been working for forty years that such things should still be.\\" Clarkson was portrayed by Stephen Campbell Moore in the BBC television drama documentary Rough Crossings (2007).

They were the men who in 2003 entered into the first legal same-sex marriage in Canada, and were consequently named the Canadian Newsmakers of the Year by Time magazine. Background Leshner is a lawyer and a Jew, while Stark is a CatholicFrank, p. 61. and a manager involved in graphic design.Tracey Tyler, \\"Gay couple hope to get married today ; Pair is waiting for appeal court's decision in Charter case Judge set to perform ceremony if Ottawa loses ruling,\\" Toronto Star, June 10, 2003, pg. A.04. Leshner was born on April 8, 1948, in Niagara Falls, New York. He then lived in St. Catharines, Ontario and went to Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School. Feeling isolated in small-town Ontario as a homosexual, he went for post-secondary education to the University of Toronto.Astrid Poei, \\"Gay couple celebrating first wedding anniversary,\\" Standard, St. Catharines, Ontario: June 10, 2004, pg. A.3.Fro. In 1992, Leshner, who worked for the Ontario government, made news when he successfully argued before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal that the provincial government should allow survivor pensions for gay people.\\"Ontario won't appeal gay rights ruling; Group says there's no political will to end discrimination in provincial laws\\". Ottawa Citizen, September 29, 1992. He then told the media he believed that private companies should also allow such pensions for homosexuals, or they could be subject to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Leshner also said, \\"I'm rather hard on the gay and lesbian community in part because I think there's too much emphasis on why you should feel sorry for yourself. Social change will happen as quickly as you're willing to move it. If it doesn't happen, don't blame [Prime Minister Brian] Mulroney.\\"Staff, \\"Gay rights ruling affects companies, lawyer says,\\" Kitchener- Waterloo Record, Kitchener, Ontario: November 5, 1992, p. B.8. The 1992 decision led the Ontario New Democratic Party government of Bob Rae to introduce the Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167) in 1994, although the bill failed on second reading amid controversy. Marriage When Leshner heard of colleagues' plans to try to legalize same-sex civil marriage, he persuaded Stark to get married so the two could start the case.Frank, p. 62. Leshner considered himself to have been in a common law marriage with Stark for 22 years.Michael Leshner, \\"Why gays find Harper scary,\\" Toronto Star, June 10, 2004, pg. A.27. After the ruling by a lower Ontario court, Leshner proposed to Stark in front of reporters.Gay Abbate, \\"Lovers now at liberty to pop big question,\\" The Globe and Mail, July 13, 2002, pg. A.6. The marriage then occurred after the decision Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General) by the Court of Appeal for Ontario deciding homosexuals should be allowed to marry. The Michaels afterwards became well known in their city Toronto, and appeared in the 2003 gay pride parade.Frank, pp. 60-61. The two even made international news.\\"Ontario: Gay couple top newsmaker,\\" Examiner, Barrie, Ontario: December 22, 2003, pg. A.8. Paul Boddum, a Canadian artist profiled in the National Post for his work based on dogs, made a portrait called \\"Schmikey the Schnauzer\\" for Leshner and Stark as a wedding present. The National Post said this was \\"Boddum's most famous commission to date.\\"Nathalie Atkinson, \\"Picture-perfect Pop Art Pups: Retail Therapy: Give your dog his day with a custom portrait,\\" National Post, December 20, 2003, pg.

Leshner replied that \\"I really feel like we're Canada's new Mary Pickford... we are Canada's sweethearts... What better human rights story to send around the world that says Canada loves the Michaels, and for the rest of the world to wonder, what on earth is going on in Canada?\\"CBC.ca, \\"Gay couple Time's Canadian newsmaker for 2003,\\" December 21, 2003, URL accessed 20 February 2007. However, some Canadians have been critical of Leshner and Stark, and wrote to newspapers calling them a \\"sick aberration,\\" while other Canadians did defend them. One paper called this an \\"apt reflection of public opinion polls\\" indicating Canadians were divided on whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.\\"Marriage revolutionized in 2003,\\" Star-Phoenix, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: December 26, 2003, pg. D.5. The Globe and Mail, in choosing the \\"Nation Builders of the year,\\" did not select Leshner and Stark. However, they did select the judges involved in the case, namely Chief Justice Roy McMurtry, Eileen Gillese and James MacPherson.Erin Anderssen, \\"Doing Canada justice,\\" The Globe and Mail, December 13, 2003, pg. F.5. Afterwards In 2003, Bishop Jean-Louis Plouffe argued that future-Prime Minister Paul Martin would not be truly Catholic if his government recognized same-sex marriage. At around the same time, Bishop Fred Henry said then-Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien may go to hell for recognizing such marriages. Leshner responded to these arguments, which he called \\"religious intolerance,\\" by saying \\"I think the bishop has eaten too much mad cow... The Charter of Rights trumps the Bible.\\"Kim Lunman and Campbell Clark, \\"Top bishop challenges Martin on same-sex,\\" The Globe and Mail, August 1, 2003, pg. A.1. In 2004, Leshner wrote a column in the Toronto Star speaking out against Conservative leader Stephen Harper in the 2004 federal election. Leshner expressed fear that Harper would use the notwithstanding clause to overrule gay rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Leshner said that \\"I am beginning to feel like a Jew in Germany in the early 1930s.\\" Also in 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada listed Leshner and Stark among the intervenors in the case Re Same-Sex Marriage, which found that the federal government could establish same-sex marriage.Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698. Following the decision, the press noted Leshner and Stark took part in celebrations. Leshner publicly commented in reference to Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, who Leshner perceived as having been defeated by the ruling, \\"Ralph, I'm 56-years-old and I can now say: 'Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-na-na.'\\"James Cowan, \\"Tories 'whomped,' gay advocate says,\\" National Post, Don Mills, Ontario: December 10, 2004, pg.

Equal justice under law is a phrase engraved on the West Pediment, above the front entrance of the United States Supreme Court building in Washington D.C. It is also a societal ideal that has influenced the American legal system. The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932. It is based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to ancient Greece. Proposed by architects and approved by justices Justice Van Devanter (left) and Chief Justice HughesThis phrase was suggested in 1932 by the architectural firm that designed the building.Pusey, Merlo. Charles Evans Hughes, Volume 2, p. 689 (Columbia University Press 1963). Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Justice Willis Van Devanter subsequently approved this inscription, as did the United States Supreme Court Building Commission which Hughes chaired (and on which Van Devanter served).[ West Pediment Information Sheet] via U.S. Supreme Court web site. At that time, the other members of the Commission were Senator Henry W. Keyes, Senator James A. Reed, Representative Richard N. Elliott, Representative Fritz G. Lanham, and Architect of the Capitol David Lynn. See Liu, Honxia. \\"Court Gazing: Features of Diversity in the Supreme Court Building\\", Court Review (Winter 2004) The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by Cass Gilbert, though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning.Goodwin, Priscilla. \\"A Closer Look at the Bronze Courtroom Gates\\", Supreme Court Quarterly, Vol. 9, p. 8 (1988). Thus, according to David Lynn who at that time held the position of Architect of the Capitol, the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan \\"equal justice under law\\" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.McGurn, Barrett. \\"Slogans to Fit the Occasion\\", pp. 170-174, United States Supreme Court Yearbook (1982). In 1935, the journalist Herbert Bayard Swope objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word \\"equal\\" be removed because such a \\"qualification\\" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said. Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to \\"place a strong emphasis upon impartiality\\". This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous. According to law professor Jim Chen, it is common for people to \\"suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico.\\"Chen, Jim. \\"Come Back to the Nickel and Five: Tracing the Warren Court's Pursuit of Equal Justice Under Law\\", Washington and Lee Law Review, Vol. 59, pp. 1305-1306 (2002). The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say \\"equal law under justice\\", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.Ball, Milner. Lying Down Together: Law, Metaphor and Theology, p. 23 (Univ. of Wisconsin Press 1985). Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence The words \\"equal justice under law\\" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court.Cabraser, Elizabeth. \\"The Essentials of Democratic Mass Litigation\\", Columbia Journal of Law & Social Problems, Vol. 45, p. 499, 500 (Summer 2012).Peccarelli, Anthony. \\"The Meaning of Justice\\", DuPage County Bar Association Brief (March 2000), via Archive.org. In the case of Caldwell v. Texas, Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the Fourteenth Amendment: \\"the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law.\\"Caldwell v. Texas, 137 U.S. 692 (1891). The last seven words are summarized by the inscription on the U.S. Supreme Court building. Chief Justice Fuller (front center) wrote for a unanimous Court in Caldwell. In this 1899 photo, Justice Harlan is seated to his right, and Justice Peckham is standing to Harlan's right.Later in 1891, Fuller's opinion for the Court in Leeper v. Texas again referred to \\"equal...justice under...law\\".Leeper v. Texas, 139 U.S. 462 (1891). Fuller's opinion in Leeper stated: \\"It must be regarded as settled that....by the Fourteenth Amendment the powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, except that no State can deprive particular persons, or classes of persons, of equal and impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied; and that due process is so secured by laws operating on all alike, and not subjecting the individual to the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice.\\" Like Caldwell, the Leeper opinion was unanimous, in contrast to the Fuller Court's major disagreements about equality issues in other cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson.Aside from Fuller, the members of the Court in 1891 were as follows: Joseph P. Bradley, Stephen Johnson Field, John Marshall Harlan, Horace Gray, Samuel Blatchford, Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, David Josiah Brewer, and Henry Billings Brown. The Fuller Court most famously disagreed about equality issues in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). In both Caldwell and Leeper, murder indictments were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged. The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law.Stuntz, William. The Collapse of American Criminal Justice, p. 124 (Harvard U. Press 2011). In a case nine years later (Maxwell v. Dow), the Court quoted the \\"equal...justice under...law\\" phrase that it had used in Caldwell and Leeper, to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are \\"proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them.\\"Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581 (1900); Justice Peckham wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Harlan was the sole dissenter. Harlan argued that a person cannot be tried for an infamous crime by a jury of less than twelve persons, instead of the eight jurors allowed in Utah. Many years later, in Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court held that six jurors are enough. In the 1908 case of Ughbanks v. Armstrong, the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments: \\"The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law.\\"Ughbanks v. Armstrong, 208 U.S. 481 (1908). Ughbanks was a burglary case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice Rufus Peckham, while Justice John Marshall Harlan was the sole dissenter. The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of Robinson v. California). In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words \\"equal justice under law\\" with the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, in the 1958 case of Cooper v. Aaron, the Court said: \\"The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal.\\"Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958).Mack, Raneta and Kelly, Michael. Equal Justice in the Balance: America's Legal Responses to the Emerging Terrorist Threat, p. 16 (U. Mich. Press 2004). The words \\"equal justice under law\\" are not in the Constitution, which instead says that no state shall \\"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\"Feldman, Noah. Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices, p. 145 (Hachette Digital 2010). From an architectural perspective, the main advantage of the former over the latter was brevity ‚Äî the Equal Protection Clause was not short enough to fit on the pediment given the size of the letters to be used. Following ancient tradition Pericles, Greek statesman and generalIn the funeral oration that he delivered in 431 BC, the Athenian leader Pericles encouraged belief in what we now call equal justice under law.Rice, George. Law for the Public Speaker: Legal Aspects of Public Address, p. 171 (Christopher Pub. House, 1958). Thus, when Chief Justice Fuller wrote his opinion in Caldwell v. Texas, he was by no means the first to discuss this concept.See, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886): \\"Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.\\" There are several different English translations of the relevant passage in Pericles' funeral oration. Here is Pericles discussing \\"equal justice\\" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874: > Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are > rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration > favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. > If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private > differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to > reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere > with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve > the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.Thucydides, > The History of the Peloponnesian War, Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by > Richard Crawley (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg. The English translation by Benjamin Jowett in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: \\"the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes\\".Jowett, Benjamin. Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides, Second edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press (1900): \\"Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbours, but are an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognised; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition.\\" And, the English translation by Rex Warner in 1954 had Pericles saying: \\"there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes\\".Pericles's Funeral Oration, translated by Rex Warner (1954), via wikisource: \\"Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition.\\" The funeral oration by Pericles was published in Thucydides‚Äô History of the Peloponnesian War, of which there are several other English translations. As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives. Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription \\"equal justice under law\\" by referring to the judicial oath of office, which requires judges to \\"administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich\\". Decades later, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall made a similar point: \\"The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law.\\"Pennzoil v. Texaco, 481 U.S. 1 (1987)(Thurgood Marshall, concurring in the judgment).\\"How To Handle A Texas-sized Lawsuit\\", Chicago Tribune (April 11, 1987).

In common usage, \\"sinus\\" usually refers to the paranasal sinuses, which are air cavities in the cranial bones, especially those near the nose and connecting to it. Most individuals have four paired cavities located in the cranial bone or skull. Etymology Sinus is Latin for \\"bay\\", \\"pocket\\", \\"curve\\", or \\"bosom\\". In anatomy, the term is used in various contexts. The word \\"sinusitis\\" is used to indicate that one or more of the membrane linings found in the sinus cavities has become inflamed or infected. It is however distinct from a fistula, which is a tract connecting two epithelial surfaces. If left untreated, infections occurring in the sinus cavities can affect the chest and lungs. Sinuses in the body * Paranasal sinuses ** Maxillary ** Ethmoid ** Sphenoid ** Frontal * Dural venous sinuses ** Anterior midline *** Cavernous *** Superior petrosal *** Inferior petrosal ** Central sulcus *** Inferior sagittal *** Superior sagittal **** Straight ** Confluence of sinuses ** Lateral *** Transverse *** Sigmoid ** Inferior *** Occipital * Arterial sinuses ** Carotid sinus * Organ- specific spaces ** Costodiaphragmatic recess (lung/diaphragm sinus, also known as phrenicocostal sinus) ** Renal sinus (drains renal medulla) ** Coronary sinus (subdivisions of the pericardium) ** Lymphatic spaces *** Subcapsular sinus (space between the lymph node and capsule) *** Trabecular sinuses (space around the invaginations of the lymphatic capsule) *** Medullary sinuses (space between the lymphatic cortex and efferent lymphatic drainage)  Paranasal sinuses  The four paired sinuses or air cavities can be referred to as: *Ethmoid sinus cavities which are located between the eyes. *Frontal sinus cavities which can be found above the eyes (more in the forehead region). *Maxillary sinus cavities are located on either side of the nostrils (cheekbone areas). *Sphenoid sinuses that are located behind the eyes and lie in the deeper recesses of the skull. Function The function of the sinus cavities within the cranial bone (skull) is not entirely clear. Beliefs about their possible function include: *Sinus cavities allow for voice resonance *They help filter and add moisture to any air that is inhaled through the nasal passages and in the removal of unwanted particles from the sinus cavities. *Sinus cavities lighten the skull. *Sinus cavities allow space to accommodate for growth *Sinus cavities may serve as shock absorption upon trauma Sinusitis If one or more of the paired paranasal sinuses or air cavities becomes inflamed, it leads to an infection called sinusitis. The term \\"sinusitis\\" means an inflammation of one or more of the sinus cavities. This inflammation causes an increase in internal pressure within these areas. The pressure is often experienced in the cheek area, eyes, nose, on one side of the head (temple areas), and can result in a severe headache. When diagnosing a sinus infection, one can identify which sinus cavity the infection is located in by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis refers to an infection in the ethmoid sinus cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis refers to an infection occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is used to refer to an infection in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst sphenoiditis refers to an infection in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies. =Classification= Sinusitis can be acute, chronic or recurrent. *Acute: Any sinus infection which lasts for a maximum of three weeks can be referred to as acute sinusitis; with the affected individual displaying symptoms such as congestion, post nasal drip, halitosis, a runny nose as well as sinus pressure and pain in the affected areas. *Chronic: This infection extends beyond the three-week period and if left untreated can persist for years. Certain causes of chronic sinusitis can be allergies that have been left untreated, bacterial or fungal infections within one or more of the sinus cavities or any allergic disorders which targets and increases the sensitivity of the mucous membrane linings which surround the sinus cavities and nasal passages. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are debilitating headaches, green colored mucus, severe nasal blockages or congestion and heavy pressure experienced in the cheek, forehead, temple and eye regions. *Recurrent: This type of sinus infection is intermittent; a person usually experiences this type of infection numerous times throughout a year with period of complete relief being experienced for weeks or months in- between. =Causes= A sinus infection can have a number of causes. Untreated allergies are one of the main contributing factors to the development of sinus infections. A person with a sinus infection often has nasal congestion with thick nasal secretions, fever, and cough (WebMD). Patients can be treated by ‚Äúreducing the swelling or inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, eliminating the infection, promoting drainage from the sinuses, and maintaining open sinuses‚Äù (WebMD). Sinusitis can be treated with medications and can also be eliminated by surgery. Another cause of sinus infections is a result of bacterial invasion within one or more of the sinus cavities. Any bacteria that enter the nasal passages and sinus cavities through the air that is inhaled, are trapped by the mucus secreted by the mucous membranes surrounding these areas. These trapped particles can cause an irritation to these linings resulting in swelling and inflammation. ‚ÄúBacteria that normally cause acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (WebMD). These microorganisms, along with Staphylococcus aureus and some anaerobes (bacteria that live without oxygen), are involved in chronic sinusitis. (WebMD)‚Äù Fungi can also cause chronic sinusitis. Certain abnormalities or trauma related injuries to the nasal cavity can make it difficult for effective drainage of mucus from the sinus cavities. This mucus is then allowed to develop in these areas making the cavity an ideal area in which bacteria can both attach and thrive. =Treatment outlook= Sinusitis or sinus infections usually clear up if treated early and appropriately. Apart from complications, the outlook for acute bacterial sinusitis is good. People may develop chronic sinusitis or have recurrent attacks of acute sinusitis if they suffer with allergies or if they have any ‚Äústructural or anatomical causes\\" which predispose them to developing sinus infections. Viral sinus infections do not however respond well to conventional treatments such as antibiotics. When treating fungal sinusitis, an appropriate fungicide is usually administered.

Fuller, Wilbur F. Stone, Chief Justice Joseph R. Reed, Henry C. Sluss, and William W. Murray The United States Court of Private Land Claims (1891‚Äì1904), was a United States court created to decide land claims guaranteed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and in the states of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming. Origins Map of the San Miguel del Bado Grant in central New Mexico, from the United States Court of Private Land Claims, Julian Sandoval Case 25 (1894‚Äì1902). During Spanish (1598‚Äì1821) and Mexican (1821‚Äì1846) rule over what was to become the U.S. Southwest, the governments made land grants to various individuals and communities. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States obtained these territories, and in Article VIII guaranteed the rights of Mexican and former Mexican citizens to their property.\\"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\\" The Avalon Project, Yale Law School, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA California Powder Works v. Davis (January 22, 1894) 151 U.S. 389, 395 citing Chief Justice Waite in Phillips v. Mound City Land and Water Association (February 13, 1888) 124 U.S. 605, 610 However, the U.S. Senate in ratifying the treaty eliminated Article 10, which stated that the U.S. government would honor and guarantee all land grants awarded in lands ceded to the United States to citizens of Spain and Mexico by those respective governments. Thus land grants were subject to being proved. In 1851, Congress passed the first legislation implementing the property protection provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, however it addressed only the Spanish and Mexican grants in California.\\"An Act to ascertain and settle the private Land Claims in the State of California\\" March 3, 1851, 9 Statutes at Large 631 (sometimes referred to as the Mexican Claims Act). Congress focused on California's land grants first because California was already a populous state, and it wanted to encourage further settlement of the public domain land there. In 1854 the U.S. Congress established the office of the Surveyor General of New Mexico to ascertain \\"the origin, nature, character, and extent to all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico.\\" At first the Congress tried to deal with each land grant by special bill and the House had a Committee on Private Land Claims, seats on which were sought after as a way of dispensing patronage. By 1880 the corruption\\"no claimant could secure such legislative confirmation of his title unless he had money enough to go to Washington, organize a lobby, fight or buy off bloodsuckers and wield sufficient influence to get a bill through Congress for such purposes.\\" Stone, W.F. (1904) \\"The United States Court of Private Land Claims\\" New Mexico Bar Association Minutes of the Annual Meeting p. 7 inherent in determining these claims by politics rather than on a legal basis forced an end to this practice.Reeve, Frank D. (1961) History of New Mexico Lewis Historical Publishing Co., New York, vol. 2, p.255 For ten years no claims could be proved as against the United States. So the U.S. Congress, in 1891, created the Court of Private Land Claims consisting of five justices appointed for a term to expire on December 31, 1895. The court itself was to exist only during this period, although its existence and the terms of the justices were from time to time extended until June 30, 1904. This court was given jurisdiction over claims to land in the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and in the states of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming, which had not been previously proved and affirmed by the United States. Many of these Spanish or Mexican land grants were based upon incomplete documentation, in part because those governments did not issue deeds to the grantees, and records were kept variously at the territorial, state, vice-royal or imperial level. Work of the Court The court heard over three hundred cases involving over thirty-six million acres (150,000 km2) of land. Only eighty-seven land grants were confirmed, for a total of three million acres (12,000 km2), or less than 10%. Many confirmed grants were reduced in size from that claimed. For example, the Ca√±on de Chama Grant was reduced from 200,000 to 1,500 acres (800 to 6 km2).Stone, W.F. (1904) \\"The United States Court of Private Land Claims\\" New Mexico Bar Association Minutes of the Annual Meeting p. 7 Among the many problems facing the court were the old Spanish system of metes and bounds. Century or two old landmarks were hard to find. The length of a vara (Spanish yard) might vary depending on the date of the grant. A grant might be to the faldas (Spanish skirt) of the mountains, which could be anywhere from the edge of the foothills to timberline.

(now U.S. Route 1) from 1771 to 1835 near what is now Jessup, Maryland. George Washington visited the tavern several times during his presidency. After an 1835 fire, the building was repaired for residence by the family of its owner, who died there in 1852. It was demolished sometime thereafter. 1700s William Spurrier was from what is now western Howard County where his father Thomas Spurrier owned two properties, Spurrier's Lot and Grime's Venture. Thomas Spurrier sold Spurrier's Lot and Grimes Venture to his sons Joseph and Richard in 1788. About 1760, William Spurrier married Ann Brown. By a will dated March 18, 1755, Ann Brown had inherited from her father. The land was a part of a tract known as Brown's Purchase. On the Brown's Purchase tract, at the junction of the north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest roads, was William and Ann Spurrier's dwelling. In August 1771, Spurrier was given a license to keep an inn or ordinary.Hamlin p. 14 In 1783, William Spurrier was compensated 13 pounds by the government.Hamlin p. 15 Elements of the French Army, on the way back from the victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781, camped near the tavern. Spurrier probably provided lodging and/or food and beverages to some of the French officers. In the 1780s, Spurrier had financial problems and in June 1788, to protect his assets, conveyed much of his personal property, including Brown's Purchase and the tavern to his son John. In November 1788, William went bankrupt.Hamlin pp. 15‚Äì16 In the 1790s, George Washington, while President, frequently made the journey from Mt. Vernon to the seat of government, at the time in Philadelphia. Washington avoided public houses where possible, he preferred staying in private homes. He sometimes stayed at a public house. According to his diary Washington stopped at Spurrier's a number of times. Thomas Twining, a British passenger on a stage coach trip from Baltimore to Georgetown in April 1796, described Spurrier's as a \\"solitary inn\\" at which they \\"found the usual substantial American breakfast\\". 1800s William Spurrier died in January 1801. John Spurrier died in 1810.Hamlin pp. 16, 33 The Maryland Chancery Court ordered the tavern property and other lands to be sold to settle John Spurrier's estate. Rosalie Stier Calvert bought the tavern and land with her father's money at public auction in June 1811 for $20,000. The Stiers were a Belgian aristocratic family that came to the United States as refugees from the European wars of the 1790s. For a time, the Stiers lived at the William Paca House in Annapolis before building Riversdale House in Prince Georges County. Rosalie Stier married George Calvert in 1799. Circumstances forced her Stier relations to return to Belgium and Rosalie Calvert's father left Riversdale to her along with funds to invest for her children. The Spurrier's tavern property was earmarked for Rosalie's oldest child, Caroline.Callcott pp. 7‚Äì39, 323n The Spurrier family had leased the property to Henry McCoy on a seven-year lease before putting the property up for auction.Callcott p. 248 As the lease holder, McCoy had naming rights. The tavern was known as McCoy's until 1818. In 1814, McCoy became postmaster of McCoy's post office, the first post office along the north‚Äìsouth road in what is now Howard County. The post office was closed in 1815 and reopened in the tavern in 1819 as Waterloo, remaining open until 1836.General Post Office ledger rescued from the December 1836 Post Office fire, NARA George Calvert became the president of the new Baltimore - Washington Turnpike Company, charted in 1812.Callcott p.306 In constructing the new turnpike, the road was rerouted further west, just south of the tavern so as not to distance it from passing traffic. Rosalie Calvert also bought of land along the north‚Äìsouth road, in part to prevent anyone from building a tavern in competition with hers. With the development of Washington City as the federal capital, stage coach traffic on the Baltimore-Washington road was growing. In October 1816, Rosalie Calvert wrote to her father, living in Belgium, a status report on the prospering tavern. Business was so good Rosalie had planned to build a new brick stable, two houses for the coachmen's families and a cook house to replace an old rotten one. She also planned stabling for an additional 40 horses. The lease holder also had the obligation to provide oats for the horses. There were a few hundred acres available to grow the oats. In 1818, Henry McCoy's lease expired and Rosalie Calvert selected Jeremiah Merrill as the next lease holder. On various contemporary maps, the tavern was labeled Waterloo, Merrill's Wateroo and Merrill's.Hinds p. 81n Calvert and her family were pro-English and considered the British to be the saviors of their home country, Belgium. The family estates were near the site of the Battle of Waterloo. Calvert named the tavern Waterloo. She named another property she bought with her father's money Waterloo as well.Callcott p. 323n Rosalie Calvert died in 1821. An 1827 lithograph by T.M. Baynes shows the inn as a tall two-story 3-bay wide structure with front porch, lantern, and sign servicing stagecoaches. It had individual rooms and hot baths for travelers. Decline and later ownership The B&O; Railroad was constructing the Thomas Viaduct across the Patapsco River near Elk Ridge Landing as part of the railroad's route to Washington City. By 1834, the viaduct was nearing completion, and the railroad was laying the railroad tracks to Washington. One operation was just east of the Waterloo Tavern where crews were cutting a pass through a hill, called Jessup's Cut. In late 1834, the railroad crews rioted and the violence spread west to the tavern. Several outbuildings were damaged. The local Maryland militia was called out to restore order. By the late spring of 1835, construction was complete, the tracks had all been laid and the B&O; company started running trains to Washington.July 5, 1835, letter by B&O; employee, Daniel Mangin. Private Collection. The B&O; Washington line spelled doom for the stage companies operating along the Baltimore-Washington Turnpike. Conveniently, there was a fire at the tavern during July 1835. Just as conveniently, contemporary newspaper accounts of the fire related that a stage coach had stopped during the fire and the passengers were available to help evacuate Merrill's property from the tavern. The fire enabled Merrill to get out of his lease.Hinds p. 82n The tavern, though not destroyed, was no longer a viable business enterprise. In January 1836, George Calvert dumped the Waterloo property on his daughter. The property was transferred to Caroline Calvert Morris with her brother George Henry Calvert designated as trustee, thus leaving Caroline's husband with no control over the property.July 10, 1852, indenture in the Howard County land records. With this indenture George H. Calvert transferred the Waterloo properties to Caroline's children to enable them to sell the holdings. The indenture contains a summary of the ownership of the property dating back to the time of William and John Spurrier. Caroline Calvert had married Thomas W. Morris in 1823. In the late 1830s, the family lived at the Waterloo property during warmer weather while Thomas Morris was effecting repairs to make the old tavern building suitable as a year-round residence. The Morris family was living full-time at Waterloo by 1839.Hinds p.75; letters from Caroline Morris and her daughter Anna to Thomas Morris' mother Anna W. Morris, 1839; private collection. By the early 1840s, Thomas Morris had changed the name of the property to Glenthorne.Callcott p. 386 The name did not stick and the property was known as Waterloo in the land records after Thomas Morris died. Caroline died in 1842. Her father had died in 1838 and left his entire estate to his two sons. Thomas Morris made efforts to determine which of the Calvert properties were actually a part of George Calvert's estate and which belonged to Rosalie's father's (Henri Stier's) estate, to try determine if his wife, Caroline, had an interest in any other properties that were not part of her father's estate.Riversdale House holds copies of letters between Thomas Morris and Charles Stier, Rosalie's brother, from 1839 to 1842. These letters show that Tomas Morris tried to obtain information about the holdings of Henri Stier's estate. Riverdale Historical Society, Riverdale Park, Maryland. Ultimately, through a lawsuit, in 1846, Thomas Morris was able to obtain an additional $11,000+ for the devalued state of the tavern property but little else from George Calvert's estate. Thomas Morris died at the property in 1852. After their uncle George H. Calvert transferred control of the Waterloo properties to the four surviving children of Caroline and Thomas Morris, they sold the properties in three transactions in 1852 and 1853. By 1852, the holdings were in four parcels, Brown's Purchase, Second Discovery, the Anvil, and a second segment of Brown's Purchase. All but the Anvil, including Waterloo Farm, were sold to David P. Hayes, who continued to own some of the property as late as 1891.Hinds p. 83n 1900s In 1917, the state of Maryland bought parts of two former farms adjoining the Baltimore and Washington boulevard at Waterloo, totaling , for the use of the Maryland House of Correction. Referred to as Shamrock farm and Waterloo farm, both were described favorably by the Maryland State College of Agriculture (renamed a few years later as the University of Maryland). According to a 1980 inventory of the Maryland House of Correction by the Maryland Historical Trust, \\"farming was discontinued during the 1960s and lands were sold off to the Maryland State Police, the Patuxent Institution, the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women and the Correctional Camp Center, and the Maryland Wholesale Produce Market complex on the southeast corner of Route 1 and Route 175.\\" Present The former location of Spurrier's Tavern is now the major intersection of U.S. 1 and Maryland Route 175 in Jessup, Maryland. A Holiday Inn now occupies the site, which bears Maryland historical markers. At least three such markers have been posted along these roads. The text of the markers has changed slightly over the years, adding some detail and removing notice of its being the place where George Washington's horse died. Washington mentioned Spurrier's several times in his diary entries.

In his conduct of the court, though always courteous, he insisted that the dignity of the bench must be upheld, and he was quick to restrain anything in the nature of contempt of court.

Founded in 1878 as \\"The Chester School for Girls\\", Queen Victoria, who was the school's first patron, issued a royal decree naming the school as \\"The Queen's School\\" in 1882, the only school in England to have this distinction. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association. History Founded in 1878 by a group of prominent Chester citizens as The Chester School for Girls, the school owes its royal name to Queen Victoria. In response to a request from the Duke of Westminster, an early benefactor of the school, in 1882 she commanded \\"that the School in question shall be styled the Queen's School\\". The school originally had its home at 100 Watergate Flags, an 18th-century house built upon the site of an extramural Roman bathhouse. Once again, the Duke of Westminster supported the school by offering the trustees a piece of land which had once been the site of Chester's City Gaol and House of Correction, together with a gift of ¬£500 towards the building of a new school. This site, right on the city walls of Chester still exists today as the home of the school's senior pupils. More recently, further buildings have been constructed or acquired, so that the school inhabits a mixture of Georgian and Victorian buildings as well as modern ones. The Queen's Lower School was originally based in two large Victorian houses in Liverpool Road. It still occupies this site but has expanded in recent years. Curriculum Girls are taught a range of subjects including languages, mathematics, the sciences (separately), technology, the humanities, PE and the creative arts. All pupils from Reception learn three languages and in Year 7 are required to learn Spanish and Mandarin Chinese and may choose a language of their choice from those two or French the following year. The Queen's School regularly appears in league tables as one of the region's top independent schools based on examination results. The Queen's Lower School was one of three independent schools in Cheshire to be named in The Sunday Times' top 100 schools for 2011 based on SAT results. The 2011 ISI inspection rated both the Lower School and Senior School curriculum as \\"excellent\\" in all areas. The Queen's School is the only independent school in the north of England to be recognised and designated \\"Confucius Classroom\\" status by Hanban for excellence in teaching Mandarin Chinese. Extracurricular A range of extra-curricular activities and clubs are offered at both the Lower and Senior Schools. Educational trips take place to theatres, museums and both local and regional sites of interest. Trips abroad to locations such as China, Africa, America, Latin America and Europe take place several times a year. Music lessons are available to individuals or groups. The school has a number of orchestras, bands, ensembles and choirs and organises regular musical and dramatic productions. The school hosts the Chester Youth Symphony Orchestra once a week. The Lower School Young Voices choir has been semi-finalists for the past three years in the BBC Songs of Praise School Choir of the Year competition, reaching the final in 2015. Competitive sports played include hockey, lacrosse, netball, swimming, rowing, skiing, gymnastics, equestrian, badminton and athletics. Hockey, netball and swimming teams range from U10s to U18s, others for Senior School only. The school's hockey players are regularly placed as county champions or higher across a range of age groups. The Lower School team were North of England Champions in 2013 and the U14 Team were placed in the top 9 in the UK in 2016. Both the Lower and Senior School Swimming Teams reached the National Finals in 2015. The school's Fitness For All strategy aims to increase participation in sport by girls through offering a wide variety of non-competitive sports.

Ammianusxiv. 25. mentions Seleucia and Claudiopolis as cities of Cilicia, or of the country drained by the Calycadnus; and Claudiopolis was a colony of Claudius Caesar. It is described by Theophanes of Byzantium as situated in a plain between the two Taurus Mountains, a description which exactly, corresponds to the position of the basin of the Calycadnus. Claudiopolis may therefore be represented by Mut, which is higher up the valley than Seleucia, and near the junction of the northern and western branches of the Calycadnus. It is also the place to which the pass over the northern Taurus leads from Laranda.William Martin Leake, Asia Minor, pp. 117, 319. Pliny mentions a Claudiopolis of Cappadocia, and Ptolemy has a Claudiopolis in Cataonia. Both these passages and those of Ammianus and Theophanes are cited to prove that there is a Claudiopolis in Cataonia, though it is manifest that the passage in Ammianus at least can only apply to a town in the valley of the Calycadnus in Cilicia Trachea. The two Tauri of Theophanes might mean the Taurus and Antitaurus. But Hierocles places Claudiopolis in Isauria, a description which cannot apply to the places so named of Pliny and Ptolemy. The city apparently received the Roman colony name Colonia Iulia Felix Augusta Ninica, and minted coins in antiquity. Later assigned to the province of Isauria, the town became a bishopric. It is no longer the seat of a residential bishop, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church under the name of Claudiopolis in Isauria.Catholic Hierarchy Its site is located near modern Mut, Asiatic Turkey.

He also served as the eighth president of the College of William and Mary.  Youth, education  Born in Port Republic, in Augusta County, near Staunton, Virginia, he was the son of John and Agatha (n√©e Strother) Madison. He was educated at home and at a private school in Maryland, before attending the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia where he graduated with high honors in 1771. On July 29, 1772, he received the gold medal given as a prize for classical learning by the Royal Governor of Virginia, Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, who is better known in Virginia as \\"Lord Botetourt\\".Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography He read law with George Wythe, and was admitted to the bar, though he did not practice law.Colonial Williamsburg, biography of Bishop James Madison  Dual career: educator and theologian  Madison taught philosophy and mathematics at the college from 1773 to 1775, when he went to England to be ordained a priest of the Church of England. He returned to the Colony of Virginia, and was serving as an instructor at William and Mary as the hostilities which led to the American Revolutionary War broke out. He was a cousin of James Madison, Jr. (1751‚Äì1836), who was a member of the Virginia General Assembly, U.S. Representative in the first four sessions of the United States Congress, and the fourth President of the United States. Both Madisons were heavily involved in the issues of freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. In 1777, Madison served as chaplain of the Virginia House of Delegates and organized his students into a militia company. The same year, Loyalist sympathies of the college's president, the Reverend John Camm (who had been the initial litigant in the Parson's Cause case 1758-1764), brought about Madison's removal from the faculty. But later, Madison became the eighth president of the College of William and Mary in October 1777, the first after separation from England. As the College's President, Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Thomas Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School, which was also known as the Brafferton School. The 1693 royal charter provided that Indian School of the College educate American Indian youth. The College's founder, Reverend Dr. James Blair had arranged financing for that purpose using dedicated income from England which was interrupted by the Revolutionary War. By 1779, the Brafferton School had permanently closed, although \\"The Brafferton\\", as it is known in modern times, remains a landmark building dating to the Colonial Period on the campus.Virginia Vignettes: What Was the Brafferton School? Along with establishment of new, firmer financial footing, the creation of the graduate schools in law and medicine officially made the \\"College\\" a school meeting the contemporary definition of a \\"university\\" by 1779, notwithstanding the retention of the word College in the original name (as set forth in the 1693 Royal Charter). The Reverend Dr. Madison also presided over the first convention of the newly formed Diocese of Virginia of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America in 1785 and was consecrated as a bishop on September 19, 1790, in Canterbury, England. Despite the concerns of some patriots, the Right Reverend Dr. Madison, or Bishop James Madison, as he came to be known, successfully served both the College of William and Mary and the Diocese of Virginia separately during the important transitional period. Madison sought to step down from his duties as bishop in 1805; whether an assistant bishop was chosen, as he appears to have wished, is somewhat unclear.https://archive.org/details/digestproceeding00dashuoft/page/62 He remained as President of the College of William and Mary for 35 years, serving until his death, although quite infirm in his last years and unable to attend the General Convention. Bishop Madison died on March 6, 1812, about a year after he ordained future bishop William Meade as a deacon. Bishop Madison is interred in the chapel of the College in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Heritage  Although he is not generally regarded as one of the founding fathers of the United States, his role in successfully helping restructure and lead both the College of William and Mary and the Church of England in the United States during and after the American Revolution was a major contribution to the new country. In modern times, the Bishop James Madison Society, a secret society which was founded in 1812 immediately after his death, is named for him. Also named in his honor is a residence hall at William and Mary.

Childhood  Anna Cora Ogden was born in Bordeaux, France, March 5, 1819. She was the tenth of fourteen children. Her father was Samuel Gouveneur Ogden (1779‚Äì1860), an American merchant. Her mother was Eliza Lewis Ogden (1785‚Äì1836), granddaughter of Francis Lewis, a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence. In 1826, when Anna was six years old, the Ogden family returned to the United States. She attended private schools but was primarily educated at home. From a young age she was encouraged to read and showed a passion for writing and acting.  Career  On October 6, 1834, at age 15, Anna Cora Ogden eloped with James Mowatt (1805‚Äì1851), a prominent and wealthy New York lawyer. They moved to an estate in Flatbush, New York, where her husband encouraged her to continue her education and to write. She wrote of her elopement: Anna Cora Mowatt's first book, Pelayo, or The Cavern of Covadonga, was published in 1836, then Reviewers Reviewed in 1837 using the pseudonym \\"Isabel\\". She wrote articles which were published in Graham's Magazine and Godey's Lady's Book and other periodicals. She wrote a six-act play, Gulzara, which was published in New World. Under the pseudonym Henry C. Browning, she wrote a biography of Goethe. Using the pseudonym \\"Helen Berkley\\", she wrote two novels: The Fortune Hunter and Evelyn. Evelyn is written in the epistolary style. In 1841, due to financial problems, Anna became a public reader. Her first performance was attended by Edgar Allan Poe, who wrote of her, \\"A more radiantly beautiful smile is quite impossible to conceive.\\" Her readings were popular and well attended, but her career as a reader was short lived due to respiratory problems. While recovering from her illness, she returned to her writing. Beatrice in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothingalt= In 1845, her best-known work, the play Fashion was published. It received rave reviews and opened at the Park Theatre, New York, on March 24, 1845. On June 13, 1845, she made another career move to acting, she debuted at the Park Theatre as Pauline in The Lady of Lyons with great success. Although her next play, Armand, the Child of the People was published in 1847, and also received good reviews, she continued in her acting career. She performed leading roles in Shakespeare (for instance, in a production of Cymbeline in London, 1843), melodramas, and her own plays. She toured the United States and Europe for the next eight years. On February 15, 1851, her husband, James Mowatt died. After a short break she resumed her acting career. In December 1853, her book Autobiography of an Actress was published. Anna Cora Mowatt's last appearance on the public stage was June 3, 1854.  Later years  On June 7, 1853, Anna married William Foushee Ritchie (? ‚Äì 1868), son of Thomas Ritchie. Their wedding was a lavish affair, attended by President of the United States, Franklin Pierce and his Cabinet. During the next few years she wrote two more novels, Mimic Life, published in 1855 and Twin Roses, published in 1857. She was also involved in the preservation of George Washington's home, Mount Vernon. Anna left her husband in 1860 and moved to Europe. She wrote the novel Mute Singer, published in 1861. She wrote Fairy Fingers, published in 1865. In 1865, she moved to England, where she wrote The Clergyman's Wife, and Other Sketches in 1867. Anna Cora Ogden Mowatt Ritchie died in Twickenham, England, on July 21, 1870. She is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London, beside her first husband, James Mowatt.

The Red Line was built with bus rapid transit elements including dedicated bus lanes along the sides of Minnesota State Highway 77/County Road 23, as well as distinct stations, although it cannot be classified as bus rapid transit in accordance with the BRT Standard. The line is planned to be extended to the suburb of Lakeville, Minnesota, eventually running from Mall of America in Bloomington, the southern terminus of the Blue Line light-rail service, to 215th Street in Lakeville. In July 2011, the Metropolitan Council officially designated the Cedar Avenue BRT line as the Red Line. This is part of a broader scheme to designate Minneapolis-St. Paul transit lines by color. Corresponding lines within the system include the Blue Line, the Green Line, and the then under development Orange Line BRT along Interstate 35W. After a few construction schedule setbacks, the line officially began operation on June 22, 2013. While the Red Line is a part of the METRO system, it is currently operated by the MVTA. However, on December 5, 2020 Metro Transit is expected to take over operations.  Background  Corridor logo from 2007 The corridor has seen rapidly increasing traffic volumes over the past 20 years due to explosive growth in Dakota County. Traffic congestion is a commonplace along much of the corridor as far south as County Road 42. The Metropolitan Council, county and local officials promoted the transitway as a means to improve mobility in the corridor. The Red Line runs from the Mall of America in Bloomington to the Apple Valley Transit Station (and will later serve 215th Street in Lakeville), serving some of the fastest growing areas in the Metropolitan Area and in the State of Minnesota. Traffic volumes on Cedar Avenue currently exceed 100,000 vehicles a day at the Minnesota River bridge every morning, with congestion sometimes extending as far south as County Road 42 in Apple Valley. The cities of Lakeville, Farmington, and Eagan are projected to double in population between the year 2000 and 2025, and the City of Apple Valley will gain half again its current population: 90,000 more residents in the Corridor. Red Line bus rapid transit buses have more futuristic detail. Operation The MVTA operates the Red Line. It contracts with the Metropolitan Council to provide the service. In October 2020 it was announced that the Metropolitan Council would not renew its operating contract with the MVTA, instead opting for Metro Transit to take over operations. Frequency and hours of operations are planned to remain unchanged. In the Red Line's first year of operation, the MVTA's ridership numbers reached record levels. Red Line buses run mostly on bus-only lanes. Most stations meet the Red Line on the highway, so that buses do not have to exit to make a stop. Fleet The Red Line operates using Nova Bus LFX 40' buses, the first and only in the Twin Cities. The Metropolitan Council is currently preparing to replace the fleet. Stations and transit way Cedar Avenue was reconstructed with new bus shoulder lanes for easier travel between Downtown Minneapolis and Lakeville. The transit way begins at Mall of America and heads towards Eagan, Apple Valley and Lakeville with bus shoulder lanes on both sides of Cedar Avenue, making it easier to bypass traffic. Stations were designed with bus pull-offs to allow buses to pass other buses picking up and dropping off passengers. At Cedar Grove, buses used to exit the highway to use Cedar Grove Transit Station. Recently, Dakota County built a new center-median Cedar Grove station on Cedar Avenue. This reduces travel time by several minutes, as buses no longer exit the freeway. The 300-foot climate-controlled walkway over Cedar Avenue connects the new station to the existing transit station. This addition to Cedar Grove opened on May 20, 2017.https://patch.com/minnesota/applevalley-rosemount/new-cedar-grove- transit-station-opens-south-metro From the route's opening on June 22, 2013 until May 19, 2017, northbound Red Line buses used to make an additional stop outside of the Mall of America at 28th Avenue Station.

The Theology of Aristotle or Theologia Aristotelis () is a paraphrase in Arabic of parts of Plotinus' Six Enneads along with Porphyry's commentary. It was traditionally attributed to Aristotle, but as this attribution is certainly untrue it is conventional to describe the author as \\"Pseudo-Aristotle\\". It had a significant effect on early Islamic philosophy, due to Islamic interest in Aristotle. Al-Kindi (Alkindus) and Avicenna, for example, were influenced by Plotinus' works as mediated through the Theology and similar works. The translator attempted to integrate Aristotle's ideas with those of Plotinus -- while trying to make Plotinus compatible with Christianity and Islam, thus yielding a unique synthesis. Overview The Theology of Aristotle, with The Letter on Divine Science and The Sayings of the Greek Sage, a collection of fragments, together form the Plotiniana Arabica. They seem to have been adapted by Ibn Na'ima al-Himsi, a Christian, and edited by Al-Kindi, a Muslim (both writers were active in the ninth century).See Adamson, Before Essence and Existence: al-Kindi's Conception of Being. There is also a longer version of the Theology, the authorship of which is uncertain. According to Shlomo Pines, it may have been written by Isma'ilis. Paul Fenton, on the other hand, thought it may have been derived from Egyptian Jews. Just as there is an Arabic paraphrase of Plotinus' Six Enneads, blending it with Aristotle's thought, so also there is an Arabic paraphrase of Aristotle's De Anima, blending it with Plotinus' thought. Thus later Islamic philosophy, and European philosophy which built on the Islamic philosophical texts, were based on this Neoplatonic synthesis.

Background The sequel to Bambi follows the lives of the twin children of Bambi and his mate Faline as they grow from fawns to young adults. Salten wrote the sequel while living in exile in Switzerland after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria as he was of Jewish heritage. Originally written in German, the novel was first published in English in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill. It was not published in German until the following year. Perri, a squirrel character from one of Salten's earlier novels, makes several appearances in the book. The models for Geno and Gurri were Felix Salten's own children, Paul who was careful and timid, and Anna Katharina, who was merry and optimistic. Salten also included himself as the responsible and humane hunter in the novel.Eddy (2010), p. 201. Translation history In German language, the content of Bambi‚Äôs Children is more violent, even gorier than that of Bambi, A Life in the Woods, but violent depictions of killings and mutilated animals have been toned down or removed from the English translation so that its language appears gentler than that of Bambi. Although the title page of the American edition claims that the English translation is ‚Äúcomplete and unabridged,‚Äù in reality it is somewhat abridged and greatly altered in tone and content; for instance, italicized wordplay has been added to the English edition. On the other hand, the 1977 Swedish translation, Bambis barn, is essentially abridged, without a mention of this in the book.Comparing Bambi‚Äôs Children. Felix Salten himself did not want to be identified merely a children's author, and he opposed the changes his American publisher wanted to make in Bambi‚Äôs Children, for instance to the section which depicts the mating season of the moose. He wrote to his American publisher: > ‚ÄúAt this time I beg you most urgently, quite apart from softenings, not to > advertise my work as a children‚Äôs book or to launch it otherwise in such a > way.‚ÄùEddy (2010), p. 293‚Äì294. Salten's original German text of Bambis Kinder does not have chapter divisions; the text is only divided into 22 unnumbered sections by blank lines. However, the English-language edition consists of 30 chapters, and the abridged Swedish edition only has 14 chapters.

Their father, Faline's cousin Bambi, watches over them and, at times, takes care of them while their mother is busy. During their lives, they interact with Lana and Boso, twin fawns of their Aunt Rolla. One day, Gurri is attacked by a fox, but survives because a hunter shoots the fox at the last moment. She is then taken away by the hunter (known only as ‚ÄúHe‚Äù by some of the animals; in the English translation, he is referred to as a gamekeeper, and the name has been changed to the \\"brown He\\" because of a brown coat he wears, but such detail is never mentioned in the German text). When she is brought to the \\"He's\\" place, she meets his dog, Hector, and a European eagle-owl that He captured a while ago. The owl is kept in a cage, and he tells Gurri about the times when He uses him as a bait to attack crows and other birds of prey and shoots them. Then Bambi finds her, and he tells Gurri that he will come every night to teach her how to jump over the fence. But when \\"He\\" sees the tracks of Bambi in the corral, He sets Gurri free. When she comes back, tensions between her family and Rolla's family start to rise. First, Rolla asks Gurri to tell her what had happened, but she doesn't want to talk because she thinks that she would not honor her miraculous salvation and Bambi's effort properly. Then one day, Rolla gets attacked by a wolfdog, Nero. While trying to escape him, she accidentally lures the wolfdog to where Faline and the others are hiding. The wolfdog immediately turns his attention to Geno, and chases him instead. When Faline sees Geno disappear, she blames Rolla for \\"sacrificing\\" her son. After Bambi saves Geno from the wolfdog, Geno finds Rolla, and he is then reunited with his sister and mother. When they see Rolla, Gurri gives her a warm welcome, while Boso starts developing a grudge against them. He starts antagonizing Geno, claiming that his ordeal was greater. When Faline and her children leave, a feud between the two families is started. When Geno starts to grow his antlers, he and Gurri discover two orphaned male fawns named Nello and Membo. Faline decides to adopt them as new friends for her children, so they can forget about their new enemies. When Geno gets older, he meets Lana again. Boso comes out and challenges Geno to a fight, but Geno refuses. Boso starts to call Geno a coward. Only at a third encounter, when Geno thinks no witnesses are around to see Boso humiliated, he fights Boso and defeats him; he offers a truce, but Boso instead turns away. One day, Boso is shot by a boy hunter, but before the boy can kill him he escapes. He then runs into Bambi, and Bambi has him use the same techniques that his father, the Old Prince, told him to use when he got wounded. The boy later returns to the meadow and tries to kill a deer from a pack, thinking that Faline and Rolla are bucks. But right when he is about to shoot, Bambi jumps out and charges him down. In the end, the two families end their feud and become friends again. At the end, Faline lets her children go their own paths. On the final page, she appears to the meadow with a newborn fawn, Ferto.

Individuals are prone to develop cancers of the colon, genitourinary tract, and skin lesions, such as keratoacanthomas and sebaceous tumors. The genes affected are MLH1, MSH2, and more recently, MSH6, and are involved in DNA mismatch repair.  Symptoms  Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome is characterized by both: # At least a single sebaceous gland tumor (either an adenoma, an epithelioma, or a carcinoma) # A minimum of one internal malignancy The Amsterdam criteria are frequently used to diagnose Lynch syndrome and Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. They include the following: * 3 or more relatives with an HNPCC-associated cancer (i.e., colorectal, cancer of the endometrium, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis) * 2 or more successive generations affected by cancer * 1 or more persons with cancer is a first- degree relative of the other 2, at least 1 case of colorectal cancer younger than age 50 years, a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis has been excluded, tumors are verified by histologic examination Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome is a genetic condition. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are linked with the disease. These genes code for DNA mismatch repair genes, and mutations increase the risk of developing cancerous qualities. Many patients who have sebaceous neoplasms with mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 do not in fact have Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. The Mayo Muir‚ÄìTorre risk score was devised to improve the positive predictive value of immunohistochemistry and reduce the false positive rate. The Mayo Muir‚ÄìTorre Risk score assigns points based several characteristics. A score of 2 or greater has a high positive predictive value of Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. A score of 1 or lower is less likely to be Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. Age of onset of first sebaceous neoplasm: <60 years = 1 point, otherwise 0 points Total number of sebaceous neoplasms: 1 = 0 points, >2 = 2 points. Personal history of Lynch related cancers: No = 0 points, Yes = 1 point Family history of Lynch-related cancer: No = 0 points, Yes = 1 point The most common internal malignancies associated with Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome are: Colorectal (56%), Urogenital (22%), Small Intestine (4%), and Breast (4%). A variety of other internal malignancies have been reported. Cause= Genetic overlap with Turcot syndrome  A couple studies have been conducted on patients with both Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome and Turcot syndrome. It is thought that the two may have some genetic overlap. Both have been associated defects in MLH1 and MSH2 genes. In one study, a patient with defective MSH2 and MSH6 mismatch repair genes exhibited both syndromes. This is the first case where a patient with genotypic changes consistent with HNPCC has been properly diagnosed with an overlap of both syndromes. Along with neoplasms of the sebaceous gland, this patient developed cerebral neoplasms, characteristic of Turcot syndrome. Diagnosis Treatment  Immunohistochemistry is now being used more often to diagnose patients likely to have Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. Sebaceous neoplasms are only infrequently encountered, and immunohistochemistry is reliable and readily available, so researchers have recommended its use. Routine immunohistochemical detection of DNA mismatch repair proteins help identify hereditary DNA mismatch repair deficiency. Treatment of Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome normally consists of oral isotretinoin. The drug has been found to prevent tumor development. Patients with Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome should follow the same stringent screening for colorectal carcinoma and other malignancies as patients with Lynch syndrome. This includes frequent and early colonoscopies, mammograms, dermatologic evaluation, and imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  Incidence  Muir‚ÄìTorre was observed to occur in 14 of 50 families (28%) and in 14 of 152 individuals (9.2%) with Lynch syndrome, also known as HNPCC. The 2 major MMR proteins involved are hMLH1 and hMSH2. Approximately 70% of tumors associated with the MTS have microsatellite instability. While germline disruption of hMLH1 and hMSH2 is evenly distributed in HNPCC, disruption of hMSH2 is seen in greater than 90% of MTS patients. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers are the most common internal malignancies. Colorectal cancer is the most common visceral neoplasm in Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome patients.  Eponym  It is named for EG Muir and D Torre. A British physician, Muir noted a patient with many keratoacanthomas who went on to develop several internal malignancies at a young age. Torre presented his findings at a meeting of the New York Dermatologic Society. It was not until the 1980s when Creighton professor Henry Lynch noted a clustering of Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome patients in families with Lynch syndrome.

The relationship between the The Vermont Cynic and this new minor program is still in flux. In particular, the status of The Vermont Cynic as an newspaper that is editorially independent of the UVM administration makes it complicated to tie into coursework (even in innocuous ways, such as the possibility of getting course credit for publishing work).

Lyons is an associate professor at University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine. Career In 2002, Lyons made international headlines by analyzing the DNA of the world's first cloned cat, a kitten named Cc:, and confirming that it was indeed a true clone, a genetic copy of its mother. Lyons has helped develop DNA tests for polycystic kidney disease (PKD), an inherited condition that shortens the life of cats by causing them to suffer kidney cysts. Previous tests for this condition involved ultrasound and were not very accurate, unlike the DNA test devised by Lyons. Approximately one third of all Persian cats carried the PKD gene at one time, but because of ultrasound testing and the newer, more accurate DNA tests, these PKD-carrier cats are gradually being identified and removed from the feline gene pool by spaying and neutering. A DNA test for feline coat color carriers and feline parentage has also been developed by Lyons, and is being offered to cat breeders, like the PKD test, so that they can determine whether cats they have bred have correct pedigrees, and whether these cats carry colorpoints, Burmese Colour Restriction, long hair, colour dilution or rare coat colors, such as chocolate and cinnamon. One of Lyons' current projects is identification of the genes that cause head defect, a lethal deformity in American Burmese cats. She is also working on identifying genes that cause Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), which causes affected kittens to become blind at the age of approximately two months. Although much of Lyons' research has dealt with cats, she also works on resources for gene mapping of other companion animals, such as dogs and horses. She has a partial appointment with the California National Primate Research Center and is developing new genetic research for the rhesus macaque. References *1. *2.

Musical career As a child and during his early teens he joined the Southern Gospel Singers and later, The Williams Brothers. The Jackson Southernaires He teamed up with his brother Huey Williams in 1964, as part of The Jackson Southernaires. After their debut release, Too Late, they signed with ABC/Dunhill Records in 1972 and where they recorded Look Around and Save My Child. Later the Southernaires signed to Malaco Records. With Malaco they recorded Legendary Gentlemen (1979), Touch of Class (1981), and Down Home (1982). They won several awards during the 1980s. In 1979, while with the Jackson Southernaires, Frank became the executive producer and director of Gospel promotions at Malaco. The Mississippi Mass Choir Williams formed The Mississippi Mass Choir while serving as director of Gospel promotions at Malaco. With the company's support he began calling in personnel, including David R. Curry, who became Mississippi Mass Choir's music director. The choir's first album and video, The Mississippi Mass Choir, Live, were recorded on under the leadership of Williams. Five weeks after this album was released, Billboard magazine licensed it as the Number 1 Spiritual album in America and it stayed on the Billboard charts for an uninterrupted 45 weeks, setting a new record for gospel recordings at that time. At the 9th annual James Cleveland GMWA Awards, the Mississippi Mass won the Choir of the Year-Contemporary, and Best New Artist of the Year-Traditional. They also took home 4 Stellar Awards in 1989. Later career and death Williams continued working in the Gospel music industry until his death from a heart attack on Monday, March 22, 1993. He had been suffering from a lung infection for about two years.

Two notable landrace breeds have evolved distinctively on the island: * Manx cat, a domestic cat (Felis catus) with genetic abbreviation of the tail, which may range from no tail at all to essentially full-size. Developed as a standardised breed in the late 19th century, the Manx cat has become a popular breed worldwide, but is in danger of diseappearing on the island itself, as it is being out-bred by other cats imported over the last century by primarily English immigrants. The long-haired variety is called the Cymric cat in some breed registries, and was primarily developed in Canada, not the Isle of Man. * Manx Loaghtan, a variety of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) with brown wool and four horns, rare outside the island and considered \\"at risk\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. The dwindling numbers of the sheep have also caused a local decline in the population of wild corvid birds called choughs ‚Äì the sheep keep grasses short, making the insect prey of the birds easier to find, and the sheep dung attracts beetles preferred by the birds.

Arbitrary arrest and detention is the imprisonment or detainment of an individual, by a State, without respect for due process. These actions may be in violation of international human rights law. The Working Group was established by resolution in 1991 by the former Commission on Human Rights. It is one of the thematic special procedures overseen by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and is therefore a subsidiary body of the UN. In 2019, Cambridge University Press published The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Commentary and Guide to Practice, by international human rights lawyer Jared Genser, who has a 45-0 record litigating cases before the body. This 650-page treatise is the only book-length how to guide and commentary on the body's jurisprudence and Genser is now providing this book as a free, publicly available resource for others hoping to bring cases before the Working Group. Mandate and composition The Working Group is mandated to receive and verify information from a variety of sources, in order to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily, or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.311 Article 9 states: ‚ÄòNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile‚Äô. In considering claims of arbitrary detention, the Working Group is not only guided by State national law, but other international legal instruments may also be relevant if accepted by the States concerned. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 9(1) states; ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be Deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.‚Äù The Working Group's role is to investigate individual cases of arbitrary detention, as well as situations where the conditions in a country prompt concern over widespread occurrences of arbitrary detention. It has an intentionally broad mandate, to allow flexibility, and allow anyone to seek its assistance. The Working Group may send urgent appeals to governments to ascertain the whereabouts and condition of those allegedly detained, issues opinions on the compliance with international law and may also conduct fact-finding visits to countries. The Working Group also issue deliberations on issues, to assist States in avoiding behaviour that may enable arbitrary detention. Ensuring a communicative dialogue with Governments and intergovernmental and non- governmental organisations allows the Working Group to achieve success. The Working Group must work in coordination with other Human Rights Council mechanisms and is mandated to carry out its task with discretion, objectivity and independence.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner The Working Group mandate reflects the Commission's concerns regarding worldwide instances of detention without legal basis. The Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Working Group with the following mandate: # To investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily in individual cases # To complete field missions in order to receive information from Government and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and receive information from the individuals concerned, their families or their representatives; # To present annual reports to the Human Rights Council The mandate lasts for a period of three years, and was most recently extended for a further three-year period by Human Rights Council resolution 33/30 of 30 September 2016.United Nations General Assembly Resolution 33/30 Membership The Working Group is composed of five independent experts. They are appointed in equitable geographical distribution from the following regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Other Countries, and South America and Caribbean.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017). Three sessions are held per year, each lasting between five and eight days. The current members of the Working Group are: United Nations Office of the High Commissioner * Jos√© Antonio Guevara Berm√∫dez (Chair-Rapporteur) 2014-2020 * Leigh Toomey (Vice- Chair on follow up) 2015-2021 * Dr Elina Steinerte (Vice-Chair on Communications) üá±üáª Latvia 2016 - 2022 * S√®tondji Roland Adjovi 2014-2020 * Seong-Phil Hong 2014-2020 ** Secretariat: Christophe Peschoux; Margarita Nechaeva; Helle Dahl Iversen; Sharof Azizov; Yiyao Zhang; Nathalie Montchovet * Former members include: * Mads Andenas * Shaheen Sardar Ali * Tam√°s B√°n * Manuela Carmena Castrillo * Roberto Garret√≥n Merino * Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi * Laity Kama * Louis Joinet * Kapil Sibal * El Hadji Malick Sow * Petr Uhl * Soledad Villagra de Biedermann * Le√Øla Zerro√ºgui Process The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is tasked with acting on information of alleged cases of arbitrary detention. To fulfil this mandate, the Working Group may decide individual complaints of arbitrary detention, formulate deliberations to provide guidance on the interpretation of international standards related to detention circumstances and provide reports for the Human Rights Council. It may undertake country visits to achieve this. The Working Group does not require the exhaustion of local remedies. However, its purpose is not to replace national courts.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017). This broadens its jurisdiction, as it allows the Group to bypass governments that may be stalling procedure. Detention in itself does not necessarily violate human rights. Therefore, the Working Group must distinguish between lawful exercise of police power, and detention so lacking in lawful basis or otherwise unreasonable, that it must be considered arbitrary.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017) Individual complaints and urgent appeals=Individual complaints The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is unique in that its mandate expressly provides for the consideration of individual complaints. The Working Group is the only non-treaty-based UN human rights mechanism to investigate and decide individual complaints. Individuals anywhere in the world are therefore able to petition the Working Group for consideration. The Group acts on information submitted to it by individuals directly, their families, or through representatives of Non-governmental organisations. The Working Group then sends communications to the Governments concerned, to clarify or bring attention to the case.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner The Government is invited to respond to the allegations within 60 days, with its view on the issue. The Working Group then sends the reply to the source of the allegations, requesting more information. This process allows the Group to remain neutral in the information-gathering process.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 The Working Group has identified detention or imprisonment as arbitrary if it falls into one of the following categories; # Imposed without any legal basis # Imposed because of the exercise of human rights # Imposed in violation of the principle of fair trial # Prolonged administrative custody imposed on asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees # Based on illegal discriminatory grounds Examples of this can include continued detention after the completion of a sentence, denial of the exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, violations of the right to a fair trial, asylum and immigration claims, or detention based on ethnicity; religion; sexual orientation, etc.The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.317 Upon receiving information under this adversary procedure, the Working Group then adopts one of the following approaches;, The UN. * If the individual concerned has been released, the Group may still decide to formulate an opinion on whether or not the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary * The Group may find that the deprivation of liberty is not arbitrary, and will state an opinion as such * The Group may seek further information from the individual or the Government * If further information is unable to be sought, the Group may file the case subject to further confirmation * The Group may decide that the arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been established, state an opinion to that effect, and make recommendations to the Government. These are then communicated to the Government. The opinion requests that the state takes the necessary steps to remedy the situation in order to bring it into conformity. The fulfilment of this request is often achieved by the release of the individual. Upon evaluating contradicting evidence, such as between an individual claiming arbitrary deprivation of liberty and a government, the Working Group use a standard of 'convincing evidence', as opposed to evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315 The informal nature of the Working Group can strengthen the position of the individual represented, by easing the objective burden of proof on them. Urgent appeals If the Working Group receives information that raises concern about the immediate wellbeing of an individual, then it may, at its discretion, pursue an urgent action. The source must provide sufficiently reliable information that the continuation of deprivation poses significant threat to the psychological or physical wellbeing to the individual.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017) The alleged situation may be time-sensitive in relation to loss of life or deportation. Rapid communication is sought with diplomats, such as the Foreign Minister (or equivalent). The Working Group request immediate action to ensure the detained person's right to life, as well as physical and mental integrity are respected.Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, available at http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet26en.pdf This a purely humanitarian undertaking, and does not prejudice the Working Group's final opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty is indeed arbitrary.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Advisory procedures=Country visits In order to fulfil its mandate, the Working Group may conduct country visits. These provide an opportunity for the Group to understand the specific situation prevailing in countries. The Group undertake one to three country visits per year, upon invitation from the Government concerned.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017). For example, in May 2017 the Working Group visited Argentina. In 2016 the Group visited the United States of America and Azerbaijan. The Group tend to visit between one and four countries per year. On a country visit, members of the Working Group engage in a variety of tasks. These can include meeting with representatives of the executive, legislators, and other state officials. The Group also has the right to visit places of detention and have private discussions with detainees.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" They also enable the Working Group to evaluate internal legislation for its compatibility with international standards. Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017). Country visits enable the Working Group to gain a greater understanding of the social, political and historical environment in each country, enabling them to create context-appropriate recommendations. Deliberations More generally, the Working Group seeks to encourage broader international understanding of arbitrary detention, and promote universal standards.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 This is achieved through a more general advisory role, with the formulation of deliberations.David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. \\"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017) The Group formulates deliberations on general issues to assist States in safeguarding against the practice of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. For example, the Group have developed deliberations on issues relating to house arrest, psychiatric detention, deprivation of liberty subsequent to a conviction and resulting from the use of the internet, on rehabilitation through labour and situations regarding immigrants and asylum seekers. The Group have also provided legal analysis regarding the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and clarified the definition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law and the urgent appeals procedure. Annual reports The Working Group must submit Annual Reports to the Human Rights Council, summarising the previous year's activities. The report will express observations made while investigating cases and on field missions in differing countries. The report details the Working Group's reasoning behind legal insufficiencies, policies and judicial policies that are the cause of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and recommend best practice to safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Criticisms The Group functions as a quasi-judicial body.The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315 The Group has no direct enforcement power of its own. Instead, it relies on communication among states, policy-makers and advocates to encourage governments to implement its recommendations.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 Due to its reliance on the cooperation of states, it can be argued that this weakens the authority of the Group. The opinions of the Working Group however are legally binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights laws, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This is applicable to states that have ratified the Covenant. The opinions of the Working Group are considered authoritative by some prominent international judicial institutions including the European Court of Human Rights.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner The features of the Working Group arguably play a role in its success, as it allows it to provide a politically viable alternative to treaty-based human rights enforcement mechanisms.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 The flexible mandate enables it to avoid direct political confrontation with governments, ultimately achieving more politically acceptable and lasting solutions to individual cases of arbitrary detention.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 While the opinions of the Working Group are not binding on states, they can facilitate information sharing among non-governmental organisations and governments. This can in turn lead to an increase in government accountability. A further criticism of the Group is that it has taken no steps toward creating a robust follow up procedure, to apply pressure on states arbitrarily detaining individuals. Establishing a systematic follow up procedure could ensure an even greater accountability on governments, acting as a name and shame process to pressure them into action. A follow up procedure may also be beneficial for providing feedback for future policy decisions.Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756 It could also aid non-governmental organisations in petitioning governments with unresolved cases. Having a record of resolved cases could help the Group to keep track of the status of detainees and any correlation between the action of the Working Group. Information and statistics drawn from this can be publicised, and help to increase outreach. Development of Draft Principles In 2012, the Human Rights Council requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to develop draft basic principles. These were to provide guidelines on remedies and procedures for anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner The intention behind these were to assist states in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty.Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention States, treaty bodies, human rights institutions and non-governmental organisations were invited to submit details on the treatment of the right to bring such proceedings before a court, in their respective legal frameworks.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner The text was adopted in April 2015.United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Notable case=Julian Assange On 5 February 2016, the group released a report stating that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison in Britain and Sweden, on conditional bail, and in the Ecuadorian embassy.

Although the maize price in US was stabilized, but the production of maize in Mexico was killed. Later, US farmers use maize to produce biofuel, cause a rapid rising of price of maize. The international price of corn (maize) had been rising dramatically throughout 2006, leading to the inflation of tortilla prices in the first month of Calder√≥n's term.Banxico, m√°s optimista; espera baja en inflaci√≥n by El UniversalM√©xico aumenta la importaci√≥n de ma√≠z by El Universal Because tortillas are the main food product consumed by Mexico's poorest people,La tortilla: golpea a los pobres en M√©xico La Prensa San Diego, February 2, 2007 national concern over the rising prices immediately generated political pressures for Calder√≥n's administration. The Pact President Calder√≥n opted for using price ceilings for tortillas that protect local producers of corn.Calderon signs accord to contain tortilla prices \\"The accord limits tortilla prices to 8.50 pesos ($0.78) per kilogram and threatens prison sentences of up to 10 years for companies found hoarding corn.\\" This price control came in the form of a \\"Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact\\" between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at MXN 8.50 per kilogram of tortilla. The idea of the agreement is that having these producers ceiling their prices would incentive the market to lower the prices nationally. Criticism The Pact has been heavily criticized by both the right and the left. Critics argue that the Pact was both non-binding and a de facto acceptance of a 30% increase in the price of that product (from MXN 5.95 to 8.50 per kilogram).Impugnan diputados pol√≠tica econ√≥mica y social de Calder√≥nEl Porvenir  Local  Protesta ONG por alzas Reprueba Mart√≠ Batres ''incremento disfrazado'' al precio de la tortilla - La Jornada Many tortiller√≠as ignored the agreement, leading to price increases in well in excess of the 8.50 pesos.mercados,finanzas,economia,fondos y cotizaciones - Invertia Government opposition see this as an indication of the failure to protect the economy of poor consumers. In response to this, PROFECO, the government consumer protection agency, has also threatened with jail those tortilla producers who charge \\"excessive\\" prices. However, some major supermarkets such as Soriana, or Comercial Mexicana sell their tortillas at a lower price than the one in the agreement, and even 14% lower than the original price, reaching even MXN 5.10 per kilogram.PROFECO, \\"Quien es quien en los precios / Tortilla\\" Soriana 5.10 (pesos per kilogram of Tortilla), Comercial Mexicana 5.80 (pesos per kilogram of tortilla), Chedraui 5.90 (pesos per kilogram of tortilla). That is interpreted by liberals as evidence that price controls, and the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact, were unnecessary and potentially harmful for the market.Liberal Editorialists in Grupo Reforma, including \\"Visi√≥n Econ√≥mica / El arranque de Calder√≥n\\", by Salvador Kalifa (\\"Algunos justifican estas acciones como una manera de aumentar el capital pol√≠tico del nuevo gobierno, que era sumamente bajo al inicio del mismo.

However, in 27 cities and 15 states the price is above the agreed 8.50 pesos.

There is good access to the Interstate and Federal highway system, with I-435, I-470, and US-71/I-49 running through the area, including the Grandview Triangle. It also includes Longview Lake and Longview Community College. It is covered by the Hickman Mills C-1 School District. History Positioned near the junction of the Santa Fe, California and Oregon trails (called the Three Trails area), Hickman Mills is located in the southern part of Kansas City, Missouri, and at one time was a separate community until it was annexed by the city in 1961. The town site was originally platted in 1845 by Randall Allen; it received its name when in 1854 Edwin Alfred Hickman purchased 40 acres in Washington Township to build a steam-powered grist and saw mill along Hart Grove Creek. He had moved down from Independence when wood became scarce for his mill there and he sought to take advantage of the large amount of traffic on the nearby Santa Fe Trail at that time. Its current given name is due to a clerical error in the second half of the 19th century; when the community around Hickman's Mill applied for a federal post office, the officer in Washington, D.C., mangled the name to \\"Hickman Mills\\". As late as 1930 a plat of the area still referred to it as \\"Hickman's Mill\\", while older maps even listed it as \\"Hickmans Mills\\". The exact location of the mill is not known however one reference indicates that it was about 100 feet north of the junction of Hickman Mills Drive and Hillcrest Road, next to Hart Grove Creek which originally ran about 50 feet west, and about 300 feet south of the town center.Parkison, map p. 39 During the Financial Panic of 1857 local banks closed and credit and money became scarce; Hickman had extended credit to so many in the community that he himself became insolvent and the mill closed just a few years later in 1859. Hickman ended up going west to look for gold in Colorado and the mill was sold, the lumber from the mill being used to build other structures. An Independence milling company purchased the equipment, and a local neighbor, Solomon Young (great-grandfather to President Harry S Truman) used some of the lumber to build a barn. A pool used by the mill for boiler water was converted to use for baptisms of the nearby church. Even with the mill gone and the Santa Fe Trail growing into disuse after 1870, the town continued to grow, with the local Post Office serving the residents of both Hickman Mills and what became the town of Grandview, 4 miles south. Rail service arrived a few years later, connecting the town directly to Kansas City. The War Years The area surrounding Hickman Mills suffered greatly during the Civil War; Jayhawkers looted and pillaged while guerrillas led by men such as William Quantrill frequented the town and fought the Jayhawkers as well as against Federal troops. The opening scenes in the Clint Eastwood western The Outlaw Josey Wales are to have taken place in Jackson County and depict the Civil War in Missouri; other movies such as Ride with the Devil did the same and was partially filmed in neighboring Clay County. The survival of Hickman Mills during the Civil War was largely due to one man. Charles Jefferys was a prominent business man who emigrated from Belgium, heir to a fortune from holdings in the British West Indies. The young civil engineer purchased up to 1800 acres in various tracts between the Blue and Little Blue rivers in Washington Township, including land around Hickman's Mill. Using immigrant and slave labor, he built two mansions in the area, and a large portion of his land now contains one of the two local high schools, Ruskin High School. Jefferys suffered during the Civil War as many did here. His farm manager, Jacob Palmer, learned that Jayhawkers planned to murder Jefferys, ostensibly under the assumption that he had assisted the local rebel guerrillas and for his ownership of slaves. William Quantrill often stayed at the farm of David Tate on Red Bridge, just two miles away, and one of Quantrill's lieutenants, George Todd, owned a farm along the Blue River at Red Bridge (he and his father built the original Red Bridge over the river). Learning of the threat, Jefferys' wife begged him to leave, but as he feared the Jayhawkers would burn the farm, he remained while sending his wife and children to Philadelphia to stay with his wife's family. His farm had been visited by men asking for Jefferys' assistance; Henry Younger, father of guerrilla and future Jesse James Gang member Cole Younger, had been shot and was at Dodson, a small community north west at the current location of 85th Street and Prospect. Palmer had been asked to bring the body back to Hickman Mills for it to be picked up and taken back to Younger's home in Harrisonville. Palmer did make the trip to Dodson, but discovered Union soldiers had already moved it to Olathe, in Kansas. The following month, Quantrill and his men captured Independence, prompting numerous reprisal raids by Jayhawkers. Local farmers armed themselves and in one instance, captured several Jayhawkers looting a local home. Not wanting to keep the prisoners for any length of time, they attempted to take them to local authorities and had stopped at Jefferys farm when they were intercepted by a Quantrill patrol. Quantrill's men took charge of the prisoners, led them out the large gate where Ruskin High School now stands, and disappeared into the brush near the Little Blue river. It is assumed they were executed by Quantrill immediately after. During this period occurred the Raid on Lawrence, Kansas by Quantrill and 450 of his men. The raid was a reprisal for a number of incidents and resulted in Lawrence being completely burned, and most of the male residents being murdered. The end result of this raid was the issuance of General Order No. 11, which ordered all residents of Jackson County and nearby counties to leave their homes and the county immediately. The exceptions were for those who lived within a mile of a military post and had taken an oath of loyalty to the Union. All property left behind was to be burned or confiscated by the military. One of Jefferys' homes became a military post, Post Number One. Thirty-two local families lived at his farm for the duration of the war, their farms and property destroyed. Palmer at one point recounted seeing seventeen houses in a circle all around their property in flames. The Order's goal was to break the rebellion in Jackson County and halt the support of the local guerrillas, but it instead hardened the resolve of Quantrill and his men, who continued to fight with widespread support of the local populace. After Confederate General Sterling Price's incursion back into Missouri, the area was devastated further by both northern and southern soldiers in the battles that raged throughout the county and rampant looting that occurred as troops, Jayhawkers, and bushwhackers transited the area. Growth after 1865 It took decades for the area to recover from the devastation of the war; most anthologies of the Civil War neglect the battles that took place on the western frontier. While the battles in the east were vast and impersonal, the war in Missouri and Kansas was very personal, pitting neighbors and families against one another after the passage of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act in 1854. Charles Jefferys was owed $20,000 by the military at the close of the war; it was never repaid and Jefferys ended up relocating to Philadelphia permanently. His properties and farms continued to be run; however Jeffereys' son returned to Hickman Mills to slowly sell off the land. The last section was sold in 1905. A large portion ended as the current location of Ruskin High School, another portion, donated by the family in 1899, was to become a rail stop and depot for the community. When the St. Louis and San Francisco (FRISCO) rail line wanted to build a stop nearby, the family donated the land on condition it be named for the family. Thus, the depot of Jefferys was established one half mile west of Hickman Mills, along Red Bridge Road west of current US-71. The station had an agent and telegraph service until 1914, when the depot was destroyed by fire. Service continued until 1954, however passengers had to flag the train to stop. In recent years the rails have been completely removed, Red Bridge Road realigned, and the location of the original stop and depot are approximately where the off-ramp of southbound US-71 now exists. After the war life resumed and the first school was built in 1866 and was located at what is now the SE corner of Hillcrest Road and Longview road; the land was donated by local farmer George Hedges and the school named Hedges school. A later structure, Hickman School, was built in 1916 after consolidation with Jones school two miles west and was the first permanent brick school. It was located at what is now the corner of Longview Road and Grandview Road, about 1/2 mile west of the original. This building, one of the four original schools to comprise the new Hickman Mills C-1 School District still stands but has been out of service as a school since 1980. Most of the homes in the area were built in the early to mid-1950s and 1960s, although a handful of houses that are pre-1920 exist at the original town center located at the corner of Hillcrest Road and Red Bridge Road, just east of US-71. At this corner exists the beautiful stone church complex known as Hickman Mills Community Church. The church, originally established in 1845 at 87th Street and Raytown Road in Raytown, was relocated to Hickman Mills and is the third- oldest Christian church in Jackson County. The church was built on land donated by Hickman and was located north of the mill, and was a frame structure built in a conservative style with two front doors, one for men and one for women. By 1896 the congregation had expanded to 75 members and a larger structure was constructed. By 1929 the congregation had again doubled and the ornate stone building that exists today was built; this building received an award from the Kansas City chapter of the American Institute of Architects as well as 1st prize from a church architecture competition sponsored by the Christian Herald. One of the millstones from Hickman's Mill can still be seen at the church. Northeast of the church is a smaller stone building with the date \\"1921\\" on the face which once served as the town bank. Across from the original bank building is an old frame structure that served as a community center and post office with a gymnasium on the 2nd floor, and next door is the original telephone exchange building. In the early 1950s the telephone exchange for Hickman Mills was \\"DW\\", for DWight. During the later 1950s and 1960s it was \\"SO\\", for SOuthland. About 1/2 mile east of town center along Red Bridge Road on the north side near the fire station is a monument to General Order No. 11, the Civil War-era action that forced residents of this and adjoining counties to leave their farms immediately. The local area included the former Bannister Mall and other shopping centers and has seen a decline in the past few years, with most of the buildings vacant and the mall, once the largest in the region, torn down in 2009. The Santa Fe Trail featured prominently in the early years of the settlement's founding. It entered the area along what is now Old Santa Fe Road from 87th Street (forming the boundary of the current Hickman Mills High School and Santa Fe Elementary), turned at Palestine Cemetery (founded 1876), then turned at what is now 93rd Street. From 93rd Street it crossed the property that once contained the Mall, turned west down Bannister Road (formerly County Highway W) and turned south at the town of Holmes Park between what is now Marion Park Drive (the former rail bed of the FRISCO line) and Hickman Mills Drive (old US-71) to a point about one mile northwest of the original town site. It eventually crossed the Blue River at a ford just north of the existing bridge along Red Bridge Road at Minor Park, about 2 1/2 miles due west of town. A spur from the trail may have run towards Hickman's Mill; starting at 93rd Street at Palestine Cemetery, it would have run south along what is now Bennington Avenue to Red Bridge Road, but further research is needed.Parkison, p. 7 The location of one of the current high schools, Hickman Mills Sr. High (and the adjoining Santa Fe Elementary) is on the grounds of a Santa Fe Trail campsite. About one mile away is a small park (Schumacher Park) commemorating the Santa Fe Trail with maps of the route through Hickman Mills and other information. In 1957 the Ruskin Heights tornado ripped through the area before hitting Ruskin Heights, killing 44, and destroying hundreds of buildings including Ruskin High School. The school was rebuilt and a monument to the victims of the tornado is located near the school at the corner of E. 111th St. and Blue Ridge Blvd. NotesReferences * An Illustrated Historical Atlas Map of Jackson County, Missouri (1877).

Through his travels he has been given several titles, including: \\"Van the Unemployed\\", \\"Van the Freeloader\\", \\"Hangover Van\\", \\"Steel Van\\", \\"Invincible Van\\", \\"Pretty Boy Van from the Garbage Dump\\", \\"Van the Unsung Hero who Gives It All He's Got\\", \\"Van of the Dawn\\" (his favorite), \\"Daybreak Van\\", \\"Nice Guy Van\\", \\"Van that Weird Guy who Helped Out\\", \\"Van of a Thousand Conquests\\", \\"Van of a Thousand Naps\\" (according to Joshua), \\"Van, The Devil in The Poisoned Tuxedo\\", and \\"Van the Devil's Swallowtail Suit\\". Although laconic and calm of nature, whenever information about the Claw's whereabouts are mentioned, he quickly shifts to extreme anger. His white Armor, Dann of Thursday, or simply Dann, is held in place over the planet in a crucifix-shaped satellite, and is launched to his position when he twists his hat 180 degrees, holes varying in size form on his sword and then swings a 'V' with his sword in the air. It is one of the strongest armors on the planet, and uses a sword as its primary weapon. Due to Van's position as one of the \\"Original Seven\\" he needs to enter his armor once a week to regenerate. If he does not, he will fall ill and eventually die. In addition, Dann's regenerative abilities grant Van immortality as long as he rides periodically. Van tries his best to remain uninvolved with those he meets along his way, and if he does help them, he does so out of public sight. He has an extremely low tolerance for alcohol, and drinks milk instead. When dining, he asks for all the available seasonings or all the condiments. Although unexplained at first, he also possesses an unusual scar on his stomach; a circle split vertically down the center with seven lines radiating from the outside. Van has a habit of forgetting the names of those he meets on his travels, especially Carmen, much to her chagrin. It wasn't until later that he begins to remember consistently. The first whose name he begins to remember is Wendy. The only person's name whom he does remember right away is Priscilla because she is a strong opponent which Van considers to be almost on the same level as him. He is shown to still love his wife Helena even after her death and shows no romantic interest in anyone else. He suddenly disappears without saying goodbye, and doesn't show up until a few years later, unwittingly meeting Wendy at her home. Wendy Garret Wendy is Van's first traveling companion and joins him to find her brother Michael Garret who had been kidnapped by the Claw. Wendy is kind, compassionate, and determined and often wishes to assist those in need of help that they meet during their travel, in contrast to Van's policy of leaving everybody to him/herself. Around her neck is a pink tortoise, Kameo, that serves as a good luck charm, given to her by her brother. In the first episode it does so by stopping an incoming bullet meant for her, which leaves it with a dent in its shell. Wendy grew up in a town called Evergreen with her brother, whom she deeply cares for as he protected her from danger in her early childhood days. She carries her brother's gun which she retrieved after his kidnapping. The gun contains only one bullet, and Wendy does not use it until the final episode of the anime, ironically to shoot her brother. A point constantly made in the series is Wendy's coming of age. She is often irritated when people put her aside as a child and she has attempted various times to be more adult-like in Van's presence from when he dismissed her as a brat in the first episode to go back to her town, and Wendy tells him to stop treating her as a child because she was ready to be his wife at any time. With each progression in the story, she begins to be more ladylike as she learns more about the world. When she finally finds her brother, she decides to continue journeying with Van to find out what is right or wrong and what is true happiness, especially when she finds that she cannot deny that the world the Claw envisioned was attractive to her. She eventually follows Yukiko in trying to help the others despite not being able to fight. Also, Wendy grows to refute Van's statements at times, standing for her beliefs instead of subsiding. At the end, before Van departs, he remarks to her about how she'd grown since the first time he'd seen her in Evergreen. (An older Wendy is seen years later at the end of the series, retelling the events of the series to a reporter. By that time, Kameo had grown to the size of a coffee table and Wendy's cooking had become oriented towards how 'Van liked it', as she explains to the reporter. At that point, Van stumbles into her house unexpectedly, asking for some food and milk yet again, and the two stare at each other in shock.) Her relationship with Van is another aspect as it presented her with a revenge-driven drifter who still managed to be kind. She goes to extensive lengths to take care of him and it has been hinted quite constantly that she has feelings for him. Wendy refers to Van as her hero in the beginning, but sheds that title from him as she learns more about him, growing closer and seeing him with his flaws and his hidden side; she refers to this part of him with a memory of 'how very sweet and precious he looked when he was like that' (Episode 16 preview). Carmen 99 Carmen 99 (real name, Carol Mendosa) is a bright and self- sufficient intelligence agent/mercenary who Van and Wendy encounter in the second episode of the anime, although Van apparently has met her before. The nickname 'Carmen 99', comes both from her bust measurement (99 cm) and the number of hidden accessories she always carries. She is often looking for more ways to earn money. Carmen grew up in the town of Trinolia with her uncle and his daughter (having lost her parents), both of whom she shared a close friendship with until she left the town. Throughout the series, Carmen frequently leaves Van and Wendy's company to later reunite with them, until she finally joins forces with them at the final stand to save the planet. In the second to the last episode, she infiltrates the Claw's headquarters along with Yukiko, planting bombs along the way. Carmen winds up in a room filled with the flowers that devastated her hometown, where she confronts Fasalina, her nemesis, for the last time. While they fight, Carmen admits to being jealous of Fasalina's directness, freedom and innocent appearance, but declares that she would rather die than become like her. When the Claw dies, Fasalina begs Carmen to kill her. At first, Carmen is more than happy to do so, but when she finds Michael Garret running towards Fasalina, she spares both of them. In the end, she also admits to liking Van very much after he finally remembers her name, though she laughs it off, before flying away. Ray Lundgren Ray is a withdrawn and ruthless Armor pilot whose wife, Shino, was killed by the Man with the claw hand. He first appears in episode 4 at the last minute, making his main appearance in episode 5 but is opposed at first to Van. Like Van, he travels to find the Man with the claw hand and exact his revenge by killing him. Unlike Van he has far fewer qualms over who dies by interfering with him, something Van despises and is easily provoked by. However, according to Joshua, he apparently was completely different in behavior prior to his wife's death. Later in the series he reveals that he seeks to kill the Claw and then die too in order to meet Yoshimo again. Like Van, he also abstains from alcohol, drinking water instead, though drinks it in a sake cup. Near the end of the series his eyes are injured and his vision is blurred. His vision remains blurred until he is killed on episode 24 while he tries to kill the Claw Man, his gunshots becoming more erratic with his deteriorating vision. His final shot temporarily derails the Claw's plans by lodging itself in the timer used by the Claw Man to activate his plan. He is then killed by security vehicles and falls down the steps. He is seen in his last scene in a sort of dream sequence where Shino is still alive and he remarks on the 'strange dream' he had before being reunited with her. His rivalry with Van stems from the fact that both of them want to kill the Claw. Later in the series, they work together, although they show little concern for each other, even when engaged in combat with enemies. Ray's primary weapon is a katana-shaped gun with a large magazine where the blade would be. He holds it just ahead of the hilt and spins a disc on the chamber to fire streams of bullets. He has several hidden weapons, such as the heels of his shoes. One acts as a very small hand held gun, while the other provides a way of summoning, remote- controlling, and self-destructing Volkan. In many ways he is both very similar and opposite to Van. They both use Armors their wives worked on, completely dedicated to kill the Claw because he killed their wives, and are weak to alcohol. Where they are opposite is where Van wears a more western style, Ray wears more of a samurai style, Van uses a sword that looks like a gun, and Ray uses a gun that looks like a sword, Van focuses more on close combat where Ray fights with long distance, and finally Van summons his Armor from the sky where Ray summons his from the ground. Last words: \\"Thank you...Josh.\\" Joshua Lundgren Joshua is Ray's brother and is talkative, upbeat and sociable. Though he deeply cares for Ray, he is entirely different in behavior than his older brother. Joshua claims his brother changed to his present behavior after his wife, Shino, died at the hands of the Claw, and although he also loved Shino, he wishes for Ray to accept her death and return home instead of exacting his revenge on her killer. Joshua has great technical skills, being able to repair numerous everyday items, analyze armor weaknesses, and even set up timed explosives. Joshua is somewhat dense when it concerns females, however, since he just walks in on Priscilla when she was taking a shower, and entered a women's restroom to find Wendy in a train station. When he and Wendy first meet, they instantly get along, probably because they share so much in common. However, Van finds Joshua very annoying, and when Joshua is hospitalized after being injured when Ray confronts the Claw for the first time in the series, Van leaves Joshua behind. however, Joshua manages to catch up with help from Carmen 99, and they rejoin Van and Wendy for the final showdown. When Ray is killed, Joshua rushes to his aid, only to find himself captured by the Claw. However, before Yukiko can bust him out, he has already escaped, vowing to put a stop to the plan his older brother managed to stall before dying, and saves Yukiko as well. He is instrumental in the final battle as he succeeds in cutting power to Birthday thereby halting the Claw's plans. The El Dorado Five Nero Jos√® Carlos Barrio The El Dorado Five consist of four aging but boisterous Armor pilots, Nero, Jos√®, Carlos, and Barrio. They spend their days reminiscing about past battles, which annoys the rest of their town to no end (because they believe they are making it all up for attention), fueled by their great liking for alcohol. The fifth member, Chizuru, has already died. Each of their animal- themed Armors can unite into a one gigantic mecha (Legs, Torso, Head and Shoulders, Arms, Backpack) called El Dorado Five, which possess great strength and power. The inn they frequently visit is managed by Yukiko, Chizuru's granddaughter. Van and Wendy first meet them in their home town boasting about their deeds as armor pilots. When the town is attacked by a scientist who feels himself neglected by the town community, they arrive on the scene, but are incomplete since only four of the armors are connected together. Van remedies this, after a scathing comment, by taking Chizuru's Armor and hurling it at their armor where it connects and finally unites it into the El Dora Five for the first time in many years and defeat the villain. After this incident, their respect in the eyes of the town youngsters rises considerably. Later they also join Van's company to defeat the Claw and save the world, claiming that not many people get the opportunity to do so. After they help Van and Dann blast off into space to regenerate, they claim that Van is their \\"student\\" and that they would name him El Dora Dann. A comic trait is that Carlos is nearly always asleep, even when the group is engaged in the most ferocious battles. He does, however, wake up occasionally, and provides good advice when he does. During the final battle, their Armor is seriously damaged and the power fails. Carlos then wakes up completely, as the others admit defeat, and activates a backup power system before leading the last attack on Birthday's defenses, and helping Van get the finishing blow. Their \\"secret base\\", stereotypical speech, distinct characteristics (Nero as the hot-blooded main pilot; Jose as the cool rival and foil to Nero; Barrio as the 'big guy'; Carlos possibly as the pint-sized genius technician; and Yukiko as the token girl) uniting mecha and colorful costumes are a loving homage of super robot and Super Sentai team shows. Their final form is an homage to GaoGaiGar. When they defeat an enemy, they turn their back on their opponent, pose, and yell out \\"ADIOS, AMIGO!!!\\" Priscilla Priscilla is a pink-haired girl who met Van for the first time in an Armor battle tournament. She loves to pilot her Armor and gives all the prize money she wins to the efforts of her sister, Johanna, in raising orphans. Both were raised by a former Armor pilot-turned- nun who was the original owner of Brownie, Priscilla's Armor. She controls her armor through a control interface system implanted in her lower spine, which allows her movements to be directly mimicked by her Armor, thus taking advantage of her athletic abilities. Priscilla is a firm believer in fair play, and refused a big company's bribe to throw a championship fight. Her personality is somewhat naive and is almost always cheerful. She later joins Van's company and also gains a crush on him, much to Wendy's chagrin. She is not afraid to show her feelings for Van. The El Dorado Five even once enthusiastically encouraged her to propose a marriage to him, seeing her strong feelings. Priscilla settled on a first date instead, since it was too soon to be considering marriage. In the end, her date is postponed when Van suddenly departs after fulfilling his mission to kill the Claw and avenge his wife. Priscilla vows to one day find him and have that date. Another thing which seems to irritate Wendy (and Carmen), is that Van managed to remember Priscilla's name almost right away after their first meeting, while he didn't manage to remember Carmen's name before the very last episode. Yukiko Steavens Yukiko is the owner of the inn \\"Pink Amigo\\" in the El Dorado Five's hometown. She is the granddaughter of the late Chizuru Steavens, one of the members of the El Dorado Five. Yukiko has a soft spot for the remaining members and the sound of her beautiful voice always calms them down when they are about to create a ruckus. When the El Dorado Five join Van's company to save the world, she decides to go as well to care for the aging group. She acts as the cook during that period of time. In the last two episodes, she accompanies Carmen 99 as they infiltrate the Clawed Man's headquarters to find Joshua after he was imprisoned. She was almost captured herself, but was saved by Joshua, who had already escaped. Toting a stolen rifle, Yukiko then guards him as he hacks into the system and cuts the power, and also provides him with moral support when he reminisces about Ray. Antagonists=The Claw The Claw, whose real name is never revealed, is a mastermind with a prosthetic claw for a right hand and is the primary antagonist of the series. He killed both Van's and Ray's wives, and is the subject of their furious lust for revenge. Before episode 12, he is only shown in flashbacks as a shadowy figure with a claw in place of his right hand. In episode 12 however, Wendy runs into a kind old man who helps her in overcoming her sorrow for her brother. Immediately after the conversation, it is revealed that this man is the Claw the group had been looking for when Fasalina delivers his claw prosthetic to him, replacing the ordinary-looking hand he had attached beforehand. It has been confirmed that the Claw killed the Original Seven pilots and replaced them with his own. It is known, however, that he did assassinate individuals with the potential knowledge and abilities to stop him. Helena and Shino, Van and Ray's wives respectively, were two such victims. Later in the series, it is revealed he plans to create a new world which supposedly will bring happiness to all people and eradicate all sins one has committed during life, regardless of whether the people want it or not, and totally ignoring those who were already happy to begin with. His plan apparently is to change the world by dissolving himself and then combining with everyone and everything on the planet on a subconscious level, perhaps acting as a sort of conscience for people. It is never made clear what exactly would happen to civilization or to himself, nor how the process would occur. It was described by Wendy as 'mental terrorism'. Near the end of the series, it is revealed the planet's moon, as controlled by Birthday, could be used as a terraformer. The Claw Man hints that he intends to terraform the Endless Illusion into the perfect world he dreams of. It is implied that the entire population of the planet will be killed during the process and will be reborn in the new world. It is unclear whether this rebirth is possible as the Claw is very clearly insane. The plan was also violently opposed by some of his crew members, claiming he was planning on committing genocide. In one of the episodes they attempt to commit a coup against him in order to force him into revealing the details for his plans. During the negotiations, the Claw seems to strongly prefer talk instead of violence, insisting that genocide is not part of his plans. This pacifism and goodwill is debatable, as minutes later, he kills one of the rebels by hugging him (apparently of love) while slashing his back with the claw. When he relinquishes him and discovers he is dead, he breaks into shock, saying \\"I did it again\\", and repeatedly apologizing, as if unaware of his embrace being lethal for the rebel. He also shows very little sadness and is somewhat indifferent whenever one of the Original Seven is killed by Van or Ray, maintaining that as long as he has the DNA samples of each pilot, his plan will succeed. To realize his plans, he gathers a society of loyal and devoted followers (including Wendy's brother Michael and Van's mentor Gadved), six of whom are pilots of the Original Seven save Dann of Thursday. Within this society he is only known as \\"The Comrade\\". He wears simple clothes most of the time, despite being the leader. In the final episodes however he replaced this with a white outfit with a chain which leads from his collar down. This is later seen to be the standard uniform of the scientists when Michael sees their remains, all of them wearing the same sort of clothing. He also is shown to like gardening, and the company of animals. In general, he is shown to engage in creative and nurturing activities. Though he appears to be a kind and somewhat absent-minded old man, the Claw is actually very insane and does not admit to any kind of wrongdoing, despite the fact that nearly all of his actions have caused death and misery to innocents. He always rationalizes his acts as being ultimately for the good of mankind. Another driving force to his insanity is due to his impending death, probably brought about by an illness. It was revealed later in Episode 23 that the Claw managed to escape the Mother Planet 'Earth' along with a collection of other people. Apparently, they loved each other at first, but they eventually all went insane from their prolonged isolation and began killing each other, leaving only the Claw left. This is what inspired him to \\"make the world a peaceful place with my own hands\\". A little known fact is that the world known as the \\"Endless Illusion\\" was once a prison planet with the Original Seven Armors acting as 'wardens.' The Comrade had been present during the planet's fall and evolution into its present state. Not wanting to see more misery and pain to the world, he decided to become the population's 'conscience,' and embarks on a plan to assimilate himself into everyone's sub-conscious. His plan is halted before its completion when Van and his allies stop the process and the Claw meets his end as Van cuts him in half with his sword. During the final battle, the Claw shows the scope of his insanity by saying things like 'Amazing! I have so many new friends!' and finally 'Van... I really like you' before Van slices him in half. Super Robot Wars K has confirmed The Claw Man's real name to be Koo Krying Kroo („ÇØ„Éº„Éª„ÇØ„É©„Ç§„É≥„Ç∞„Éª„ÇØ„É´„Éº), William Woo's father. Michael Garret Michael Garret is Wendy Garret's older brother and was her only remaining family member in Evergreen after her parents died. When they were younger, he cared very much for her, protecting her when their town of Evergreen was assaulted by bandits. He is later kidnapped by the Claw, and Wendy joins Van in order to rescue him. However, when she finally finds him, it proves out he no longer is kept with the Claw against his will. He reveals that he has joined forces with him in order to realize the Claw's dream of eradicating all sorrow on the planet by creating a new world. Like his sister, he is usually kind and compassionate, but can be fiercely independent when he wants to. Although he has freely joined the Claw, he still has his doubts and struggles to rid himself of his suspicious feelings against the project he has joined, especially when a mutinous group attempts to rebel and they try to get Michael to join them. But in the end, he chooses to stay with the Claw and Fasalina, with whom he ends up sharing a deep bond. Michael is one of the only member of The Original Seven along with Woo who is able to control an \\"Original Armor\\" without needing surgical implants embedded into his body. This is the main reason why the Claw chose him, and Michael later proves out to be a vital part of the Claw's plan. He pilots the Original Seven Armor Saudade of Sunday, which was launched into space and destroyed two of the Original Seven satellites. There, he encounters Van and the two of them battle, with Van constantly reminding Michael about Wendy. Whether this is a diversion tactic or Van genuinely cares very much about Wendy, it enrages Michael and he blames Van in turn for making Wendy leave Evergreen. Their fight is interrupted by an explosion brought about by the moon and the liquid-state material surrounding it, but continues when they return to the Planet of Endless Illusion, where Van also continues to scold and taunt Michael for not being a good brother. In the end, Michael is defeated and Saudade destroyed. In the penultimate episode, he and Wendy meet again, and when he tells her to step aside as he still has to complete his mission, she points his own gun towards him, answering that he's not the only one with a mission to complete. She ultimately shoots him in the arm when he keeps on going, using up the last bullet in the gun. Wendy begins to explain the negative effects of the Claw's plan, which only makes Michael even angrier. He then tries to strangle her out of rage, but Wendy is saved by Kameo biting Michael's hand. Even so, he still saves her from being crushed by falling debris, and the two siblings come to an understanding and part ways, with Michael leaving his gun with Wendy and advising her to follow her own path, while he follows his. He and his lover Fasalina seemingly perish after a boulder falls on top of them, though this is not confirmed. Armor: Saudade of Sunday resembles an energy handgun Fasalina Fasalina is extremely loyal to the Claw and is his right-hand woman, and will do anything to protect both him and his dream. Before being recruited, she worked as a prostitute, and is eternally grateful for being offered the opportunity to work for the Claw. When battling in her Armor, Fasalina often taunts her opponents by being very flirtatious, thereby bringing them out of focus. She also pole dances with her staff to control her Armor. She later develops a romantic relationship with Michael and becomes a faithful supporter of him. When not fighting inside her armor, she uses a staff which can extend, bend or contract at her will. Carmen 99 develops a glowing animosity against Fasalina later in the series, for Fasalina corrupted Carmen's hometown with poisonous flowers and was indirectly responsible for the death of the latter's best friend. When the Claw is killed by Van, and the former prostitute is defeated by Carmen in their own final showdown, Fasalina begs for Carmen to kill her, after losing all of her will to live. She is later reunited with Michael only to seemingly perish with him when a boulder lands on top of them. Whether or not they had survived is in question, since they are never seen afterward. Armor: Dahlia of Wednesday resembles a staff Gadved Gadved was once a good friend of Van and Helena, as both Helena and Gadved worked researching the Original Seven armors. On the tragic wedding day when Van and Helena was critically injured by the Claw, a dying Helena asked Gadved to permanently make Van \\"Dann of Thursday\\"'s pilot, thereby making him a member of the Original Seven. In the series, Van discovers to his enormous shock that Gadved has become one of the Claw's followers. He also reveals that he was the one who told the Claw where to find Van's wife. He is a veteran Armor pilot and the last surviving member of the former generation of Original Seven pilots which he says had become corrupted, especially after the fall of the Mother Planet Earth. He is the first of the pilots to be killed by Van after they both agree to share the same dream, and the outcome of their battle was to prove who had the better conviction. In end, Van won out. Gadved, like most Original Seven Armor riders, possesses a memory-cloth weapon, in his case one shaped like an axe. Armor: Diablo of Monday resembles an axe. Carossa Carossa is a member of the Claw's society and twin brother of Melissa, though far more aggressive and rash than her. Whenever they are together it is always he who takes the initiative. Both he and Melissa were orphans and as such he has developed a deep need for attention, especially from the Claw. He is also very protective of his sister and will attack anyone who scares her or makes her cry. Nearly from the beginning, he develops a growing sense of animosity of Michael, partly because he becomes the center of the Claw's attention (due to his importance in his plan) and partly because Melissa develops a crush on him. Both siblings are members of the Original Seven and appear to be the result of research using a mental link between twins. Ray mercilessly kills both of them with his rifle during their attempt to delay the protagonists' approach to the Claw. Armor: Sin of Friday resembles a tonfa. Melissa Melissa is Carossa's twin sister. She is easily frightened but is far more reasonable and cautious than her brother. She later gains a crush on Michael, much to Carossa's chagrin. When in armor battle, she and Carossa operate in sync, allowing them to seamlessly combine into one armor for greater strength and defense. The two are also the final product of twin genome project in the wind valley city. Armor: Sen of Saturday resembling a chakram Woo Woo (full name, William Will Woo) is a member of the Original Seven and heir to a noble family. He appears cold and collected on the outside, but is filled with rage and turmoil on the inside. Woo suffers from an Oedipus complex. He regarded his father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of his mother. When Woo was an adolescent, he attacked his father with a knife in an attempt to kill him, but his mother jumped in the way and was killed. After that, Woo left the township his family had governed due to the painful memories, and left it to succumb to decay. However he says he returned to this place to intercept Van, and that this proved he had finally succeeded. Woo had become increasingly mentally unstable since then and seeks to unleash his pent-up rage in any way he can. He also calls Van and Gadved 'old types'. Van kills him after luring him towards Dann on top of his castle and they clash in a fight of wills where it is revealed that Woo 'abandoned his mother for his father's sake' (This, along with silhouettes of his parents shown in flashbacks, suggest that his father was the Claw). Van then challenges this by saying that no one who abandons their true love can defeat him. In Super Robot Wars K, it is confirmed that the Claw was indeed his father. Armor: Mets√§ of Tuesday resembles a fencing sword. The Original Seven \\"Armor\\" is the term used in the series to refer to any kind of giant, pilotable mecha, typically designed for combat purposes. Armor pilots are known as \\"Armor riders.\\" Among the wide variety of Armors, there are seven unique units that are far more powerful than others, known as \\"The Original Seven Armors.\\" They are named after the seven days of the week and are piloted by people who are picked out for the task for each generation, known as \\"The Original Seven\\". Many of these riders are given special implants in order to be able to control their Armor, but some of them are born with this ability and are considered more important. The Original Seven Armors also differ from ordinary Armors because they are contained in crucifix-shaped satellites in space when they are not in use, one station for each of the Armors. Here, they are refueled and repaired and can be summoned down to their owner at their leisure. When the Armor is summoned, it takes the shape of a giant version of a certain weapon, typically the Armor and its rider's weapon of choice, but in battle they change into a humanoid form. All Original Seven units have a blue-black liquid called G.E.R. fluid that permeates the entire armor. It runs through the body of the mecha like blood, seeping out of any wounds that the armor sustains in combat. It also fills the cockpit, able to accept neural inputs and impart healing abilities to the pilot's injuries when they are connected. The normally blue-black flow of G.E.R. fluid in the cockpit becomes a bright, iridescent white if a pilot is especially in tune with his or her Armor. Gadved eventually reveals to Van that originally the Original Seven were the guardians of the Endless Illusion, a planet \\"at the very bottom of the universe\\", used as a prison by \\"Mother\\" Earth. However they became corrupt over the coming generations and ignored their duties. With the destruction of Mother Earth, this became more extreme. Gadved also states that Van's ability to access Dann's pilot healing feature is the reason Dann of Thursday was the \\"strongest armor\\" in existence. Whether this includes Saudade of Sunday and Birthday, which were not active at the time, is not clear. It is also not clear if all of the Original Seven could heal their pilots or if said pilots could access this ability successfully. Gadved is the only remaining member from the previous generation, the others, according to him, were killed by the Claw so his own pilots could be used as part of his plan. Saudade of Sunday Pilot: Michael Garret Saudade of Sunday was retrieved from the sunken ruins of a city in episode 10, therefore, it is the only Original Seven armor without a satellite station. It is hinted that this was because being an experimental or stronger Armor; they could not control its power and its satellite station ended up underwater because of it. When it is in its compact form it has the appearance of a gigantic gun. In humanoid form, it sprouts several large wings which functions as large solar panels, thus allowing Saudade to function without continuous refueling unlike the other Original Seven Armors. Saudade wields a large sword with a gun at the hilt which fires energy beams. Saudade is later launched into space and to the moon as part of the Claw's scheme, but calculations showed that there was a 20% chance of it colliding with Dann of Thursday's base, and the satellite was destroyed because of it. Later, Saudade also destroyed Diablo of Monday's satellite station when it was reentering the planet after Dann used it to recharge. A battle between the two armors ensues, interrupted by an explosion brought about by the Claw's plan. Saudade was the first to reenter the Endless Illusion's atmosphere in episode 24 in pretty good condition. It launches into another attack against Dann when the latter returns and threatens the Birthday and the Claw. In the second and final confrontation, Dann of Thursday slashes a V into Saudade and destroys it, much to Michael's disbelief, since Saudade of Sunday was supposed to be the most advanced of the Original Seven Armors. Saudade, along with Sen of Saturday, possesses gold armor instead of the typical grey-white of most of the other Original Seven. Diablo of Monday Pilot: Gadved In appearance, Diablo is a bulkier version of Van's Armor, Dann of Thursday, and appears in episode 12, where Gadved fought Van. It appears to be slightly stronger than Van's armor, although it is unknown if this due to Gadveds longer experience in piloting or the Diablo itself. In its compact form it resembles a giant axe and it therefore wields a halberd in its humanoid form. It was defeated by Dann of Thursday with Van's greater drive and conviction. Later near to the end of the series Dann of Thursday used Diablo's satellite to repair itself after Saudade of Sunday destroyed Dann's storage satellite while on its way to the Moon. Diablo's satellite station was destroyed when Saudade of Sunday was reentering the planet's surface. Mets√§ of Tuesday Pilot: William Will Woo Mets√§ is a slender armor which first appears in episode 15, where it does battle with Van and his armor Dann. In its compact form, Mets√§ takes the shape of an enormous lance, wielding a rapier in humanoid form. During the first battle, Dann is no match against Mets√§ due to Van's inexperience in using the mech's electromagnetic shield and other capabilities. Van then descends into a sort of depressing mood playing endlessly with a rotating puzzle Gadved had given him to prepare him for piloting the Original Seven. He finally solves it by thinking of Helena and her love (more accurately, it was solved by emptying his mind of all thought of the puzzle itself, essentially making the puzzle a part of his body in his mind). By using the puzzle's solution in piloting Dann, Van unlocked the complete abilities of the Armor. This makes the rematch take a complete reversal. In the rematch, it is more will than strength which proves the outcome as both of them challenge each other about their 'loves'. Van pushes Mets√§ down through Will's 'sanctuary' and it falls onto its back, with its own lance striking the middle. This causes it to explode. Mets√§ means \\"forest\\" in Finnish. Dahlia of Wednesday Pilot: Fasalina Dahlia is Fasalina's unique Armor which she reveals in episode 20. In its compact form it is shaped as a three-part staff and accordingly wields a similar weapon in humanoid form. Dahlia is very agile and has speed to match, despite its appearance. Fasalina controls it by swinging around a pole installed in the cockpit of the armor (referring to her life as a prostitute before joining the Claw), which is also her staff. Dahlia possesses some unconventional weapons as it can fire a burst of its own G.E.R. fluid against the enemy Armor, effectively binding them since the liquid solidifies on contact. Another unique weapon is its ability to create tendrils of G.E.R. fluid from its chest for close range combat. It can also fire rocket missiles for long range combat, and even use camouflage to evade or surprise an enemy, as Dahlia looks very much like a large flower. During its fight with Dann of Thursday, it was almost destroyed until it was kicked out of the way by the El Dorado Five. However, during its second fight, Ray and Vulcan destroy her mech's arm and body with Vulcan's guns at point- blank range, thereby crippling Dahlia forever. Dahlia is one of three Original Seven Armors with a unique coloration, the armor on its body being a shade of pink. Dann of Thursday Pilot: Van Dann is Van's armor, built along the same lanky proportions as Van himself. In compact form it resembles a giant sword and thus wields a huge sword in humanoid form, from which a smaller knife can be separated. A giant blade is mounted on its back, and can provide limited flight capabilities similar to rocket propulsion. Dann is one of the few Armors which possesses no long range attacks, and it depends entirely on Van's movements and swordsmanship in order to inflict damage on its opponents. In the beginning of the series, Van has not learned to activate all of Dann's power yet, but by the last episode he has discovered how to utilize Dann's electromagnetic shield, which greatly improves Dann's odds against a long range-attacking opponent. Later towards the end of the series Dann's satellite station was shot down by Saudade of Sunday during its rocket to the moon because of the chances Saudade might have collided with the satellite station, therefore stopping Dann from repairing itself after its battle with Dahlia of Wednesday. Dann later repairs itself using Diablo of Monday's satellite station which is later destroyed by Saudade of Sunday. In the end, Dann is stored in another of the remaining satellites, though is not mentioned which one. Most unusual is its ability to instantly heal injuries or illnesses that Van has, including hangovers, once he enters the cockpit. Furthermore, it also has an Overdrive ability which can emit a highly devastating beam of supercharged G.E.R. fluid which cuts like a giant sword, although it is hinted that this ability is Van's and not Dann's. Van, as a result of a special surgery, is symbiotically linked with Dann and is required to interface with the Armor at least once per week. If he does not, he will eventually fall ill as if with a bad fever and die. Accordingly, if either Van dies or Dann is destroyed, the other will cease to exist. Sin of Friday Pilot: Carossa Sin, along with its sister armor Sen, differs from the other Original Seven because it has a nonhumanoid structure. In its compact form it is in the shape of a tonfa, while in its battle state, it is hunched backwards with large hind legs and a tail. When battling it wields a tonfa which can morph into different weapons. Sin and Sen can combine into a single Armor to increase their attack and defense, but can just as easily separate again. It can also fire energy beams at an extremely rapid rate and is protected by an electromagnetic shield. It is destroyed along with its pilot by Vulcan's beam howitzer. Sen of Saturday Pilot: Melissa Sen is Sin's sister armor, but smaller. In its battle state it is more humanoid than its sibling but the head is very alien looking. In its compact form it resembles a chakram, which is also its weapon when in battle form. The chakram is a deadly ring which can be thrown against an enemy and pierce its armor and will return to its owner like a boomerang. Sen can interlock with Sin to a single armor, where Sen resides in the interior and bottom section, protected by the stronger and bigger Sin. Like Sin, it can fire energy beams and is protected by an electromagnetic shield. It is destroyed by Vulcan's beam howitzer. Sen is one of three Original Seven Armors with a unique armor color, possessing the same pale gold as Saudade of Sunday. Other armors=Vulcan Vulcan, (pronounced \\"Volkein\\") is Ray's Armor and was built by his late wife Shino, who was killed by the Claw. It is armed with a long-range rifle, a strong handgun that is fired by connecting a pressurized hose to the Armor's power source, a gatling gun, and missiles from its back. In contrast to Van's armor, Ray summons Vulcan by repeatedly firing his gun downwards into the ground to trace out a circle around himself, signaling where it will rise from underground encased within a transport. The shell also serves to protect him while shooting his rifle long-range. Vulcan also has an extremely powerful beam howitzer capable of punching through an Original Seven's electromagnetic shields, but it has one major setback; it takes a long time to charge. Ray has also equipped Vulcan with a special energy dissipating cloak which absorbs energy blasts, giving him a huge advantage against other armors using energy weaponry. When not in combat it moves in a large drilling vehicle which can burst up from the ground wherever Ray summons it. It also includes a self-destruct feature which Ray can activate with one of his shoes. It is later revealed that Vulcan served as an inspiration for the construction of beam weapons on five of the Original Seven Armors (excluding Dann and Saudade, both not in the Claw's possession at the time), since Shino worked with the people that designed the Original Seven, though was not present when they were being constructed and upgraded. The weapons were actually recent additions, only being added after the Claw recruited the Original Seven for his own purposes. Metal Guru The armor appeared in episode 2, and resembled a battleship with a vast humanoid torso attached. Metal Guru was commanded by Baron Mayor of the bridge city in order to conquer the world. Its main attacks were the use of its gigantic arms and the Regulus Cannon, a turret that sprayed molten metal over its opponents. Van managed to destroy Metal Guru by throwing Dann's sword through into the regulus cannon then used his foot to push on it sending the sword through the center and back out the other side. El Dorado El Dorado is an older Armor piloted by the El Dorado Five. When the series start, they have not used it for many years, but they finally use it when the safety of their hometown is threatened. El Dorado is composed of five separate smaller mechas which combine into one Armor, known as \\"El Dora Five\\", though they can combine without the support backpack to create the weaker \\"El Dora Four\\". In order for it to activate its most powerful mode, all five must be interlocked. The armor mostly relies on hand-to-hand combat but is also capable of missile attacks and launching powerful special moves. El Dorado depletes its energy fast and therefore does not last long in prolonged battle without Chizuru's \\"support unit\\". Later in the series El Dorado is upgraded into the El Dora Soul, gaining power but losing its ability to separate. In the final showdown, the El Dorado Five helps Priscilla and Brownie take down the incoming One-on-Ones, armors at the Clawed Man's disposal. Near the end, El Dora Soul hurls Dann of Thursday like a javelin towards the Birthday after the shield around it was deactivated, so that Dann could finish off the Birthday. El Dora Five (and by extension El Dora Soul) carries a striking resemblance to GaoGaiGar and Dancouga. Its final attack is a homage of GaoGaiGar's Hell and Heaven attack. Brownie Brownie is Priscilla's rabbit-themed Armor, first shown in episode 14 when Van is to face Priscilla in a battle tournament. At first, Brownie is only equipped with a large electrically charged spear. During the tournament, Priscilla's main strategy is to dodge her enemies' attacks (using her athletics) waiting for the right moment to attack the opponent's weak point with the spear in a final blow known as \\"The Pixie Stab\\". It can also create a strong wind current creating a dust storm in the arena, which Priscilla uses to hide. In addition to the base unit, Priscilla installs a set of \\"heavy\\" armor on to Brownie for the tournament. The armor adds a pair of sharp blades to the knees that can be used in dashing slash attacks, but most importantly the equipment reduces Brownie's speed significantly. This is used to confuse opponents when they try to gauge the true speed and power of the armor. After Van manages to fend off Priscilla effectively, she removes Brownie's heavy armor and battles in her true form. When Priscilla rejoins Van on the Claw's base, Brownie appears with several additional forms of weaponry. A long-range cabled spike, similar to the close range Fairy Stab, has been mounted on its right elbow. Also, Vulcan cannons were added to Brownie's shoulders to provide light ranged fire. The most unusual addition is seen when Priscilla fights one of the Claw's One-on- One automated armors: Brownie attacks by flying butt-first, shooting a tail- mounted gun-pod. S-Drive Dragon First appeared in episode 8, the S-Drive Dragon resembles a metallic Chinese dragon. As well as being able to hover through the air, it used a powerful water-jet cutter from its mouth and a constricting attack to overcome any who tried to cross the mountains where it lay. The S-Drive designation referred to a set of solar panels on the spine of the dragon that would store energy from the sun. When the dragon was finally defeated, Van and Ray discover that the armor was unmanned; the Rider inside had died long ago. Van's team is ambushed by a pair of automated Dragons when they attempt to pass through the underwater tunnel leading to the Claws's base. These two dragons are armed differently, as instead of using the hydro cutter of the first dragon they attack primarily with a pair of head mounted beam cannons. These two were dispatched by Brownie and El Dora Soul. Finally, a fourth Dragon armor is used by Zapiero Muttaaca's rebel force as they try to escape from the Claw. It also attacks using the twin beam cannons, as well as unleashing a missile barrage against Saudade of Sunday from multiple back- mounted launchers. Zapiero Muttaaca's Dragon was destroyed by Michael during this encounter. Golden Cradle After Van sees through Joe's deception in episode 7, Joe summons Golden Cradle to do battle against Dann. Golden Cradle looks like a large medieval knight, with a massive cross-bearing shield and large lance as its primary armaments. Its face is half-covered by a golden helmet, the other half revealing a robotic skull face. Despite its heavily armored appearance, the Golden Cradle is reasonably agile and able to duel with Dann to some degree. After slicing open Joe's outer cockpit, Van manages to severely wound the Golden Cradle by blinding Joe with a well-reflected beam of sunlight and slashing through the armor's shield in the confusion. Joe self-destructs Golden Cradle, depriving Van of any information regarding the Claw. The Golden Cradle design is seen again when Van's team journeys to the Claw's secret base. Several automated green colored versions, called One-on- Ones, form the outer defense line of the Claw Man's facilities. The One-on-One version is armed with a set of shield-mounted machine guns in addition to its large melee lance. Their autopilot is seemingly crude and predictable, as Priscilla is able to anticipate its movements and destroy them handily. The controls of this particular armor is different from most of the other ordinary armors, the pilot needs only to put his hands on the two orbs in the cockpit to control the armor, presumably using only thoughts. Birthday (Big Brain) The ultimate Armor designed by the people who escaped from Earth, the Mother Planet, which supposedly surpassed the Original Seven. It controlled the moon of the Endless Illusion, which was actually a giant satellite used to escape from Earth by a group of scientists. It is crucial to the Claw's plot, who pilots it himself and fights against Dann of Thursday several times. Inside it is just a large room full of golden fluid instead of the traditional blue with a pillar which the Claw Man only has to lie in to control. Its prime defense is the 'Guardian Curtain' which is a curtain made of energy surrounding it. This was destroyed by Brownie and El Dora Five continuously attacking it. It is very strong, as demonstrated when it managed to almost crush Dann of Thursday with both hands, cracking the armor. It can also utilize the liquid system in the satellite to shoot streams of energy from orbit (This was later also copied by Dann who did something similar forming a sort of lance from the energy to attack with). It is immobile and appears like a gigantic smiling face with two large hands on the side. It also stores the countdown timer for the Claw's final plan (A huge upright combination lock type pillar with the reels turning, similar in design to the puzzle Van carries around). It was momentarily stopped by Ray's final shot which rebounded off the Claw's prosthetic hand and embeds itself between the reels effectively stopping the countdown at the last minute. In the end, with the help of the El Dorado Five and Joshua Lundgren (who hacked the system causing a power failure), Dann destroys the shield around Birthday before jumping up and slicing it cleanly in half.

The club, located between the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, consists of three full size outdoor polo fields, one arena, extensive horse boarding and exercise facilities, as well as stabling for 350 horses. The Santa Barbara Polo Club is home to the Pacific Coast Open, United States Polo Association (USPA) America Cup and the USPA Circuit Player's Cup. The Santa Barbara Polo Club has now expanded to be the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club adding 10 tennis courts, a club house, as well as a pool and spa. There are many events hosted at the club including polo and tennis tournaments, as well as many weddings. Photo of a sunset taken from the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club's fields  History  In 1911, the Santa Barbara Polo Club was declared an official polo club by the United States Polo Association. The club set about looking for a permanent home and found one through an $80,000 purchase of part of the property known as the Bartlett Estate on Middle Road in Montecito. The Bartlett Family took back an $80,000 loan for the property and the club raised $15,000 to build a concrete club house. They even went so far as to make the roof concrete so the members could watch the matches from on high. There were also two sets of concrete stairs to access the roof for members and waiters. The club and the fields lasted until 1928 when it was moved to its present location and the house was recently rebuilt and named Villa Polo.. During the 1920s such stars as Chaplin, Fairbanks and Will Rogers all competed here. Rogers broke his arm during a game and was quoted in the newspaper as saying,\\"They call this sport a gentlemans game for the same reason they call fat guys slim\\". The club was then erected in its present location thanks to Major Max Fleischmann. Between 1920 and 1930 the club grew in popularity and number of memberships. Horses and players arrived by train and walked to the club. World War II had adverse effects on the polo club. After a Japanese attack on Goleta, California (Attacks on North America during World War II), soldiers were stationed at the polo club to protect the members for the remaining years of the war. After a lull in polo play during the war, the Santa Barbara Club again gained momentum attracting many of the families that would eventually preserve the club. For the first time in 1963 and again in 1966, trials were held for positions on the American Polo Team for the Cup of the America's Tournament against Argentina. During the 1970s, the club was leased by Robert Skene, a 10 Goal player who would eventually become manager and is responsible for much of the club's success. In 1974, the Santa Barbara Development Company completed construction on a new polo complex at the Santa Barbara Club in which 144 condominiums were built. Kenneth Walker, Glen Holden and Dr. Norman Ringer, Trustees of the SBPC, purchased the polo ground as well as the club house a year after the complex was completed. The club then was leased to the Santa Barbara Polo Club Management Company, Inc. During the 1990s, the club is extended to intercollegiate and interscholastic play hosting the first official interscholastic tournament in the Western United States in 1995. In 1998, the Santa Barbara Polo Club hosted the most prestigious event in polo, the Federation of International Polo (FIP) World Championship. The Olympic style event (Polo was removed from Olympic competition in 1939 and is now governed by the FIP) recorded attendance of over 20,000 people. The SBPC has to date over 500 members, more than 100 of which are full-time polo players. The Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club hosts many big tournaments which bring in celebrity spectators from all around the world. In 2011 Prince William played in the Foundation Polo challenge.  Polo Academy  The Santa Barbara Polo Club is home to the Santa Barbara International Polo Training Center. The SBIPTC is a polo school for beginning players, taught by Jeff Scheraga.

Tax preparation software with e-filing capabilities includes stand-alone programs or websites. Tax professionals use tax preparation software from major software vendors for commercial use. Of the 139.3 million US returns filed in 2007, 79.98 million (or about 57.4 percent) were filed electronically. In 2010, a total of 129.3 million US returns were filed, and 93.4 million were filed electronically: in three years the percentage of returns filed electronically increased to 72.3 percent of total returns. In 2018, 89% of tax returns were filed electronically.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week- ending-may-11-2018 Taxpayers can e-file free using the IRS Free File service, either using an authorized IRS e-file provider's tax software, if eligible, or by using online Free File Fillable Forms from the Free File Alliance. Prior to 2020, the use of a third party was required for IRS e-file, and it was not possible to e-file directly through the IRS website. In 2020, the IRS made direct electronic filing available through IRS Free File Fillable Forms available to taxpayers with incomes above $69,000; for those with incomes below that amount, the documents must be sent via physical US Mail. History The IRS started electronic filing in 1986 to lower operating costs and paper usage. Since then, additional features have been added. In 1987 Electronic Direct Deposit was added as a form of payment. Milestones have been set and broken throughout the years. In 1990 4.2 million returns were reached and in recent years a record of 1 billion 1040's have been E-filed. E-filing originally used the processing system developed in 1969 by the IRS but, since 2003, the IRS has been developing a new enhanced processing system called CADE. Types of e-file providers The IRS accepts electronic submission of a variety of tax forms through their IRS Authorized e-file Providers. The IRS offers e-filing to most forms ranging from 1040's to 2290's to 990's. Individual returns Individuals have the option of both free and paid tax software. Recently a feature from the IRS called FreeFile allows users to file their individual tax returns for free. It is also possible to go through an authorized efile company that files Form 1040 with a service charge. FreeFile is free, it's an easy step by step system for those who make less than $64,000 annually and a more task-heavy form of filing for those who make above $64,000. For those who make more than $64,000 a year, the FreeFile is not step-by-step but an actual Form 1040 that can be filled out, box by box, electronically. Business returns Businesses and self-employed taxpayers can choose from a variety of commercial e-file services depending on their individual needs. Some of the forms that fall under business returns include Form 2290 (truck tax), Form 1099 (reporting payments to individuals other than employees). IRS has no set pricing for each form, so each filing company sets their own price accordingly. IRS has a list of authorized websites that do e-filing for some forms. Tax exempt organization returns Tax exempt organizations may file the annual information return IRS Form 990, Form 990-EZ and Form 990-N with a variety of independent tax software providers. As with the business returns, the IRS does not set prices; each e-filing company sets their own. Authorized e-filers IRS e-filer providers must be authorized by the IRS. The IRS provides a list of authorized e-file providers on some forms. The authorized providers must pass the testing every year.

He treated his first human patient on June 23, 1936. Mohs spent his working life at the University of Wisconsin. Mohs first tried to publish his findings and encouraged surgeons to learn the procedure. This was largely unsuccessful, as many surgeons were not comfortable learning skin pathology and laboratory techniques. Dermatologists, who are well trained in dermatopathology, and who treat skin cancers on a daily basis, quickly embraced the procedure. Today, most Mohs procedures are performed by dermatologists, although a small number of plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and pathologists are also practicing and using the procedure as well. Mohs' technique was later modified by Perry Robins in the 1970s, using fresh-tissue frozen histology. Rather than using the anesthetic Mohs paste, local anesthetic is used. The fresh skin specimen is then mounted on a cryostat, and frozen sections are examined instead of the Mohs paste-fixed sections. This method is now commonly referred to as Mohs surgery, and occasionally chemosurgery, in reference to the Mohs paste that Mohs initially used. Personal life In 1943 Mohs married Mary Ellen Reynolds, who died in 1995. Mohs died at his home in Madison, Wisconsin on 2 July 2002, at the age of 92.Obituary, The Wisconsin State Journal (Madison, WI), July 2, 2002 He was survived by two sons, Frederic and Thomas, and a daughter, Jane Schimming.

It was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States. History=1940s During World War II, NAPCO helped the war effort by producing specialized mechanical parts and assemblies that were tested in war conditions. As early as 1942 NAPCO began building four-wheel drive assemblies to be fitted to Ford, GMC, Chevrolet and Studebaker vehicles however NAPCO is primarily associated with GMC and Chevrolet pickups. From 1942 to 1956 4√ó4 GMC and Chevrolet trucks could be ordered by the government and civilians with a NAPCO Power-Pak kit and the kit could be installed later. The retail price of Napco Power-Pak was $995. This option raised the price on a new two-wheel drive truck from $1,548.96 to $2,796.96. The kit was shipped in a crate measuring 80\\"x30\\"x26\\" weighing 1,410 pounds. In a matter of 3 hours with as little as 4 holes drilled in existing chassis a truck would be converted into a \\"Mountain Goat\\", a \\"full sized truck that will climb steep inclines with ease\\". One feature was the \\"shift on the fly\\" rubber mounted transfer case with a dual-range option. There were companies that installed these upgrades for the previously mentioned manufacturers. Besides the four-wheel drive units NAPCO also provided winches, auxiliary transmissions, tandem drive axles, hydrovac systems, and dump truck bodies. 1950s Chevrolet Apache pickup truck with the NAPCO Power-Pak conversion From 1956 to 1959 the NAPCO Power-Pak option could be ordered directly from GM (an official RPO 690 was assigned in 1957) and factory installed on trucks with very few modifications to the original chassis. The 1955 4√ó4 NAPCO GMC or Chevrolet was a $1250.00 to $1550.00 optional add on. The 1957 Chevrolet and GMC 3100 4√ó4 price was a bargain at $2549.00 compared to the earlier add on kits. In 1960 NAPCO and GM parted ways when GM redesigned the front suspension on their 1960 pickup line so that it wasn't easily compatible with the existing Power-Pak kits. Prior to 1955 NAPCO Power- Pak conversions were done on 3/4 and one ton GMC and Chevrolet chassis. The Pre-1955 ton chassis used an incompatible \\"torque tube\\" drive. In the fall of 1954 GMC and Chevrolet changed the 1955 ton pickup and Suburban models to the compatible Hotchkiss drive. Today these trucks are still considered to be very versatile and durable 60 years later and are considered to be collectible by NAPCO enthusiasts.  Other early 4√ó4 manufacturers  Early factory 4√ó4 pickup manufacturers and early 4√ó4 conversion kit manufacturers include: *Marmon-Herrington in Indianapolis. Marmon-Herrington is commonly associated with equipping 1940s and 1950s Ford pickup trucks with 4 wheel drive. *Willys Overland along with Ford built the Willys MB Jeep working from designs by the American Bantam Car Company.

Coombes was born at Hampton Court, Middlesex, England the son of Richard Coombes, hotelkeeper, and his wife Ellen, n√©e Parsons. Coombes was educated at Hampton Grammar School, he was for some years in an insurance office, and became well known as an amateur runner and walker. He was captain of the Harefield Hare and Hounds Club, a champion walker of the London Athletic Club and captain of the Kingston upon Thames Bicycle Club. Coombes emigrated to Sydney in 1886 and took up journalism, becoming a contributor to the Referee. In 1888 he founded the New South Wales Amateur Athletic Association, introduced cross country running, and formed the Amateur Walkers Club. The amateur movement gradually spread all over Australia, and in 1897 the Amateur Athletic Union of Australia was formed. Coombes was a vice- president of the New South Wales Amateur Athletic Association from its foundation, in 1893 was elected president, and held the position until his death. He also frequently acted as handicapper, starter, judge of field games or referee, at important athletic meetings, managed the New South Wales team in contests with the other states, and in 1911 was manager of the Australian team at the Empire games in London. He was much interested in rifle-shooting, was captain of the Sydney Rifle Club and afterwards president, and was interested in rowing and coursing, being president of the New South Wales National Coursing Association for 22 years. When the Australian Coursing Union was formed in 1917 he was elected its first president About 1895 he formulated a set of walking rules which have been widely adopted.

It owns four mills, six mines and a lead battery recycling plant, all in southeast Missouri, United States, and a subsidiary Fabricated Products Inc. with locations in Arizona and Washington. It also owns two former primary lead smelter sites in the U.S. that are currently being remediated. It is wholly owned by The Renco Group, Inc History Herculaneum, Missouri The company that would become The Doe Run Company was founded as St. Joseph Lead Company in New York in 1864. In the \\"Old Lead Belt\\" of Southeast Missouri where the company operated, it was the dominant mining group. In 1887, the company purchased land to build a smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri. The lead processing smelter was built on 540 acres by the Mississippi River and began operations in 1892. During its early history, St. Joseph Lead Company developed many tools, techniques, and safety processes that became widely adopted by the mining industry. Notable accomplishments included the roof bolt in the 1920s, and the St. Joe Shovel in 1922, which replaced hand shovels and increased daily employee productivity from 21 tons of rock to nearly 300 tons. St. Joe was also the first mining company to employ a dedicated researcher, starting in 1930, which expanded into a department. With the gradual exhaustion of the Old Lead Belt after World War II, St. Joe explored other areas in southeastern Missouri and in 1955 found extensive deposits in an area that became known as the Viburnum Trend. The company owns six mines and four mills along the trend. Other companies also developed the area, but Doe Run owned all the mines and mills in the district by 1992. The company changed its name to St. Joe Minerals in 1970, and was acquired by the Fluor Corporation in 1981. In 1986, St. Joe and another mining company, Homestake Lead, formed The Doe Run Company Partnership, which added Homestake's Buick mine, mill and smelter to St. Joe's operations. The Buick smelter was later converted to the Buick Resource Recycling Division for lead recycling in 1991. The Renco Group, Inc., acquired The Doe Run Company from Fluor and renamed the company The Doe Run Resources Corporation in 1994 (although it continued to be registered to do business as \\"The Doe Run Company\\"). In 1996, Doe Run established Fabricated Products, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, and acquired lead fabricating facilities. The following year, Doe Run more than doubled in size with the purchase of the La Oroya smelter and Cobriza copper mine in Peru from state-controlled Centromin for $247 million. Doe Run's Peruvian holdings would eventually be separated into a separate subsidiary of the Renco Group in 2007. In 2001, regulators reported high levels of lead around Doe Run's Herculaneum lead smelter as well as in the blood of local children. Following this finding, Doe Run undertook a large-scale cleanup effort, purchasing approximately 160 homes and replacing soil for over 700 properties to bring the site back into compliance with the U.S. Clean Air Act. In 2010, Doe Run agreed to close the Herculaneum smelter and pay $65 million for past violations of federal Clean Air and Clean Water acts. The same year, Doe Run announced plans to replace the Herculaneum smelter with an electrowinning plant. However, in 2012 these plans were put on hold indefinitely. In December 2013, Doe Run closed the Herculaneum smelter, retaining just a small operation for refining specialty alloys and maintaining the site. After the closure of the Herculaneum primary lead smelting facility in 2013, the company altered its business model to focus on its mining and recycling operations. In 2016, citing falling prices and environmental regulations, Doe Run downsized its lead production by approximately 10 percent and eliminated 75 jobs in its Missouri facilities. In 2016, the company sold 18 acres of its former lead smelter site in Herculaneum to Riverview Commerce Park LLC for redevelopment as a commercial port. Doe Run began demolition on the five main buildings of the Herculaneum smelter in 2017 as part of its redevelopment announced in 2012. Operations=Overview The Doe Run Company manages various parts of the lead lifecycle, including mining, milling, fabrication, and recycling, and provides lead metals, alloys and lead concentrates to companies globally. The company's headquarters are in St. Louis, Missouri, and Doe Run has holdings in Missouri, Washington and Arizona. Jerry Pyatt has been president and CEO of The Doe Run Company since 2012. Doe Run employs approximately 1,100 people, and it invests in locals schools and infrastructure both financially and through employee community service. Holdings and products In the Southeast Missouri Lead District, Doe Run's mines are all on the Viburnum Trend, a 64 km long mineralized shoot with an average width of 150 meters, thickness of 3 to 30 meters and average depth of 300 meters. It is a classic Mississippi Valley type lead/zinc deposit in Cambrian carbonate rocks though it contains an unusually high proportion of lead. The principal minerals are galena (lead, PbS) and sphalerite (zinc, ZnS) with lesser amounts of chalcopyrite (copper, CuFeS2).Introduction to Ore- forming Processes By Laurence Robb Lead concentrates from the area contain more than 75 percent lead, versus an industry average of 45 to 50 percent lead. Doe Run owns six mines on the Viburnum Trend: Brushy Creek, Buick, Casteel, Fletcher/West Fork, Sweetwater and Mine No 29. These mines produce ore that is milled at the company's four mills to extract lead, zinc, and copper concentrates. Approximately 90 percent of the primary lead supply in the United States has been derived from the ore from these mines over the years. Following the closure of the Herculaneum smelter, metal concentrates from the mines are shipped overseas for smelting. Doe Run's other Missouri holdings include a recycling smelter in Boss, Missouri. The secondary smelter recycles metal from old lead batteries and scrap lead. The process creates secondary lead that can be manufactured into new products. The smelter processes about 13.5 million lead-acid batteries annually, recovering lead from the batteries for reuse. Doe Run is one of only a few North American facilities capable of removing lead from glass in cathode ray tubes that were once common in televisions and computer monitors. Safety precautions at Doe Run lead facilities include washing trucks that come into contact with lead, as well as having exposed workers shower and change clothes after each shift. In addition to mining operations and its secondary smelter, The Doe Run Company has a wholly owned subsidiary called Fabricated Products, Inc., that has locations in Vancouver, Washington and Casa Grande, Arizona. These facilities manufacture and market fabricated metal products, including lead oxide for batteries, lead shielding used for radiation protection in hospitals, extruded shapes used in plating and pollution control, lead-lined drywall and plywood, and sheet lead for roof flashing. Doe Run also owned a primary lead smelting facility in southeastern Missouri in the unincorpated region of Glover. The company acquired the facility in 1998 from ASARCO, but it was closed in 2003. Environmental issues=La Oroya, Peru In 1997, Doe Run purchased a smelter and copper mine in La Oroya, Peru from the Peruvian state-controlled company Centromin during a privatization scheme. In doing so, Doe Run agreed to reduce emissions at the heavily polluted site to acceptable levels within 10 years. Despite substantial investment in site improvements and local infrastructure, health and environmental problems persisted. Studies conducted by the Director General of Environmental Health in Peru in 1999 showed that ninety-nine percent of children living in and around La Oroya have blood-lead levels that exceed acceptable amounts. The drinking water of La Oroya has been shown to contain 50 percent more lead than the levels recommended by the World Health Organization. These studies also showed high levels of air pollution, with 85 times more arsenic, 41 times more cadmium and 13 times more lead than amounts considered safe.Poisoned city fights to save its children A 2005 study found that the town was facing a serious environmental health crisis. Not only were there elevated lead levels in children, the study also found above-normal levels of cadmium, arsenic, and antimony throughout the population. Exposure to these toxic heavy metals is associated with kidney failure, cancer, and other problems. In an interview, the author of the study said he was \\"scandalised\\" by the breadth and depth of the contamination because he \\"found levels of lead in children that you don‚Äôt even see in the USA in adults who work with lead.\\" Because Doe Run Company is a major employer in the city, union leaders and the mayor were often persuaded to side with the industry and circumvent government attempts to address the pollution, but the political tide finally started to shift in the mid-2000s In 2006, the Peruvian government granted Doe Run a three-year extension to meet emission level standards. In February 2007 Doe Run's Peruvian assets were spun out as an independent subsidiary of Renco Group, Doe Run Peru. In a 2007 press release, Doe Run Peru announced that it would appeal a fine levied on it by Peruvian regulators for surpassing emissions standards in La Oroya. Jose Mogrovejo, Doe Run Peru's vice president for environmental affairs, said that infractions were not of a magnitude that could harm the environment: \\"Our concern is that people could infer from reading the resolution that it says we have damaged the environment, and that is not the case.\\"Doe Run Peru Appeals Fine on La Oroya Emissions In September 2007, environmental health organization Blacksmith Institute listed La Oroya as one of the World's Worst Polluted Places because of pollution generated at Doe Run Company's poly- metallic smelting plant: From 2007 to 2013 nearly one thousand individuals who had been exposed to toxic metals in La Oroya as minors initiated ongoing civil lawsuits in St. Louis against \\"Renco, Doe Run Resources Corporation (DRRC), and other companies and officers associated with Renco for injuries caused by poisonous emissions.\\" In 2009, Doe Run Peru shut down the smelter after the Peruvian government cited the company for environmental violations. In April 2011, Renco Group filed an $800 million lawsuit against Peru, alleging Peru had violated the US-Peru Free Trade Agreement. The case was dismissed in 2016. Herculaneum, Missouri In 2001, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources found that street dust in the town of Herculaneum contained 30% lead. Testing the same year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency found high levels of air pollution. Test results also showed elevated levels of lead among more than half of pre-school age children who were tested living near the smelter in Herculaneum. In 2002, Doe Run undertook a voluntary buyout of homes in the area and over the next few years purchased approximately 160 homes. In addition to the buyout, Doe Run invested $14 million in the removal of lead-contaminated soil. It replaced soil for more than 700 properties, including residences, schools, public parks, and other land. By the end of the year, Doe Run was in compliance with the Clean Air Act lead standard. According to a company representative, another $12 million was spent in 2007 in an effort to further reduce air pollution from the smelter. In 2010, after issuance of new stricter EPA lead standards, Doe Run agreed to close the Herculaneum smelter and pay $65 million to correct past violations of the federal Clean Air and Clean Water acts. The same year, the company announced plans to replace the Herculaneum smelter with an electrowinning plant, which would replace smelting with a contained wet chemical process, reducing emissions by nearly 99 percent. The plans were a result of research the company had been conducting for decades to find a new way to produce lead. Doe Run invested $30 million in developing new technology until the plan was put on hold in 2012. In December 2013, Doe Run closed the Herculaneum smelter, though refining operations of specialty alloys continue. The company allocated more than $8 million for cleanup of the property following its closure. Between 2010 and 2015, Doe Run spent $289 million on environmental expenditures across its various holdings. The funds have been used in part for remediating old mining sites and for the construction of water treatment plants to treat waste from mining operations.

The concept of posthegemony is related to the rise of the \\"multitude\\" as a social force which, unlike the \\"people\\", cannot be captured by hegemony, together with the roles of affect and habitus in mechanisms of social control and agency.These ideas are discussed extensively in , , and . Posthegemony and its related terms are influenced by Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, Pierre Bourdieu and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri‚Äôs accounts of the supra- and infra-national forces that are said to have rendered obsolete the national- popular forms of coercion and consent through which, for Antonio Gramsci, hegemony structured and constituted society. The features of posthegemony as a concept correspond closely to those of postmodernity. Thus, posthegemony theory argues that ideology is no longer a political driving force in mechanisms of social control and that the modernist theory of hegemony, which depends on ideology, therefore no longer accurately reflects the social order. Some commentators also argue that history is not, as Karl Marx described it, a class struggle, but rather a \\"struggle to produce class\\". The concept of posthegemony also resonates with the work of post-Foucauldian theorists such as Giorgio Agamben. Nicholas Thoburn, drawing on Agamben's discussion on the \\"state of exception\\", writes that \\"it is, perhaps, with the recasting of the relationship between law and politico-military and economic crises and interventions that is instituted in the state of exception that the time of hegemony is most revealed to have passed.\\"  In international relations  In international relations, posthegemony refers to the decline of the US unilateral hegemony. This has likely been the result of the difficulties that have arisen out of the unilateral style foreign policy. These difficulties predominantly include disdain from; those directly affected by the, sometimes forceful, hegemonic actions of the US, those who spectated the actions, and even Americans themselves who view the actions of their government as immoral. For example, after the Vietnam War, in 1978, 72 per cent of Americans thought the war was not a mistake but fundamentally wrong and immoral. This exemplifies the hegemonic decline: how could the US maintain the legitimacy of their interventions if their own citizens find them wrong and immoral? The dominant power(s) of the world is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars. Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage, The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people could still see the inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage. Criticism Among the criticisms of the theory of posthegemony is Richard Johnson's, that it involves \\"a marked reduction of social complexity.\\" Johnson concedes that \\"one considerable achievement of 'the post-hegemony project' is to draw many observable post-9/11 features into a single imaginative picture, while also synthesizing different currents in contemporary social theory.\\" But he argues that \\"it is strange, however, that the result is viewed as the end of hegemony rather than as a new hegemonic moment.\\" He, therefore, calls for a rejuvenation of the concept of hegemony, rather than its abandonment.

Wake Cook, was a watercolour painter. Cook was born at Maldon, Essex, England and came to Melbourne in 1852. At 17 years of age Cook became an assistant to Nicholas Chevalier, who instructed him in painting, wood-engraving and lithography. During 1867 and 1868 Chevalier was commissioned to produce a number of images of New Zealand and Tasmania and Victoria, Australia, by the Duke of Edinburgh. A watercolour of Isle of the Dead in Tasmania was painted by Cook in about 1868. He was one of the original members of the Victorian Academy of Arts in 1870. In 1872 Cook studied under Eugene von Guerard at the National Gallery of Victoria. In that year he won the medal for the best water-colour exhibited at the exhibition of the New South Wales Academy of Art. He was an associate of Tom Roberts, Rupert Bunny and Bertram Mackennal,Alan McCulloch, Encyclopedia of Australian Art Hutchinson of London 1968 and for a time worked for the Adelaide Photographic Company. In 1873 Cook went to London, and from 1875 to 1926 was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy. In 1904 he published a pamphlet, Anarchism in Art and Chaos in Criticism, which was followed in 1924 by Retrogression in Art and the Suicide of the Royal Academy, an attack on all un-academic painters from Manet onwards. Cook for a time was president of the Langham Sketch Club, and an original member and honorary secretary of the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists. Cook died early in 1926. His work was popular with some collectors and dealers, but it was often regarded as pretty when it was meant to be beautiful. Cook is represented in the national galleries at Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. ReferencesSources * External links *Sale prices of works by Ebenezer Wake Cook * Watercolour.

The monument commemorates the Battle of Grunwald, a decisive defeat of the Teutonic Order in 1410. Originally made for the Polish 1939 New York World's Fair pavilion, the monument was permanently installed in Central Park in 1945. Raised on its grand plinth it is one of the most prominently-sited and impressive of twenty-nine sculptures located in the park. Description The monument is sited overlooking the east end of the Turtle Pond, across from Belvedere Castle and just south-east from the Great Lawn. To the northeast is Cleopatra's Needle and beyond, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The monument commemorates the Battle of Grunwald (1410), where Polish and Lithuanian knights supported by Ruthenian, Czech, and Tatar knights defeated the Teutonic Order. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagiello is shown seated on a horse holding two crossed swords over his head as a symbol of defiance and of the union of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces. Known as the Grunwald Swords, they were the invitation to battle offered to the king and his ally Vytautas the Great in an ironic gesture by Ulrich von Jungingen, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. Parks Chief Consulting Architect Aymar Embury II (1880‚Äì1966) designed the granite pedestal. POLAND is inscribed on both sides of the plinth. Ostrowski's name is engraved in the front lower right-hand corner. History The monument and path by the pond The bronze monument was created for the 1939 New York World's Fair's Polish pavilion by the Polish sculptor Stanis≈Çaw K. Ostrowski (1879‚Äì1947). It stood at the Fair's entrance at Queens' Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. It is a replica of a King Jagiello memorial in Warsaw that was converted into bullets for World War II by the Germans after they entered and occupied the capital of Poland. As a result of the German invasion of Poland that marked the beginning of the Second World War, the personnel and equipment of the Polish World's Fair pavilion was forced to remain in the United States. Unlike much of the rest of the pavilion which was sold to the Polish Museum of America in Chicago, the monument stayed in New York, thanks in part to mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia publicly lobbying to keep the statue. The statue was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee, with support from the Polish government in exile in July 1945, when it was permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last consul of the Second Polish Republic or pre-communist Poland in New York, count J√≥zef Kazimierz Krasicki and unveiled by him.Zosia Przerwa Tetmajer, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço w Centralnym Parku Nowego Yorku (sic), \\"MY: Biuletyn\\", nr 15 (rok 51), 15 grudnia 1993, p. 6.

The first version of Jubilee chicken was created for the silver jubilee of George V in 1935, and was based on chicken dressed with mayonnaise and curry powder. This was largely superseded by coronation chicken. The second version of Jubilee chicken was created for Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002. This version was radically different from coronation chicken and was highly publicised at the time as a modern evolution of coronation chicken. Jubilee chicken was distributed in hampers to guests at the concerts for the Golden Jubilee. In spite of both of these, its popularity has remained relatively limited compared to coronation chicken. For Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, guests at the Royal Garden Party were served \\"Diamond Jubilee Chicken\\", a variation of coronation chicken created by Heston Blumenthal. This recipe does not appear to have been released to the public. Dishes named \\"coronation chicken\\" are often sold as ready to eat by supermarkets, or offered as recipes by alternate sources; the common features are pieces of chicken, curry flavouring, and mayonnaise or a similar sauce rather than a specific recipe. Golden Jubilee Chicken Golden Jubilee chicken is a cold dish consisting of pieces of chicken in a white-coloured sauce dusted with parsley and lime segments. The sauce is a mixture of cr√®me fraiche and mayonnaise flavoured with lime and ginger; the chicken is also marinated in a combination of lime and ginger before being mixed with the sauce.

These live-bearer (Poeciliidae) fish are particularly well known for both the extreme size variation among males, and the sexual dimorphism between males and females in both body shape and behavior. It is outwardly similar to the sailfin molly, P. latipinna, though larger overall and with a higher and longer dorsal fin in males. Full-grown fish are usually larger than 10 cm (4 in) and large females can reach almost twice this length, though especially captive-bred individuals grow only to the size of sailfin mollies. The dorsal fins are the most distinctive character for telling the species apart: Those of the Yucatan molly have nearly 20 fin rays, counting where the fin meets the back, whereas the sailfin molly has less than 15 (intermediate numbers may indicate hybrids). If the males spread their dorsal fins in display, these have a distinct fan or trapezoid shape, with the upper edge being distinctly longer than the lower. The height of the dorsal fin, measured at the posterior edge, is a bit larger than the height of the tail. Common names Some names of the Yucatan molly - such as Segelk√§rpfling or the specific name velifera - contain an element signifying \\"sail\\", aggravating the confusion with the sailfin molly. The French terms are used for both species indiscriminately, as is the Japanese name (which is simply the Japanized form of \\"sailfin molly\\"). *Dutch: Hoogvinkarper *English: Yucatan molly, sailfin molly (though this name is often used for Poecilia latipinna as well as the commercially produced hybrids kept by fishkeepers) *French: Molli√©n√©sie √° voilure or simply \\"molly voile\\" *German: Segelk√§rpfling *Japanese: „Çª„Ç§„É´„Éï„Ç£„É≥ „É¢„Éº„É™„Éº (seirufuin m≈çrƒ´) *Polish: Molinezja ≈ºaglop≈Çetwa *Portuguese: Molin√©sia vel√≠fera *Russian: –ú–æ–ª–ª–∏–Ω–µ–∑–∏—è –í–µ–ª–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä–∞, –®–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ø–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞—è –º–æ–ª–ª–∏–Ω–µ–∑–∏—è *Dansk: Sejlfinnemolly *Thai: plƒÅ sel fi ny·∫°ksÃÑ πÃí (‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ã‡∏•‡∏ü‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡πå; literally: \\"giant sailfin\\") *\\"Korean\\": ÏûêÏù¥Ïñ∏Ìä∏ ÏÑ∏ÏùºÌïÄ Î™∞Î¶¨ (\\"Giant sailfim molly) In the aquarium Especially small strains are suitable for keeping in an aquarium. However, this fish is not as easy to keep as the sailfin molly, let alone the P. sphenops (black molly). They need spacious tanks with well-aerated, slightly brackish 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon sea salt per 10 liters with the higher amount being suitable for wild strains, the lower for color variants. Note that many popular freshwater fish - such as tetras and danionins - will become sick and may die in brackish water. water to thrive. They are able to withstand higher temperatures than most pet fish. Although they can survive over 30 ¬∞C for prolonged periods of time if other conditions are good, temperatures should be kept between 25 and 30 ¬∞C. Direct sunlight and an ample supply of plant food, such as lettuce, peas, or certain algae, are necessary for optimal health; in subtropical areas, they can be kept outside in unheated tanks in the summer; in temperate zones, backup heating may be necessary. This strain of molly can also be kept in saltwater reef tanks, and provide clean-up duties for the tank. To transition a molly to saltwater, adjustment time is needed; increase the salt content to match the reef tank over a period of three hours. They are bred like other mollies; in line with their general requirements, this is somewhat more difficult than in related species. It is especially hard to get males to grow their spectacular fins. Professional breeders often separate males and females in winter, so that they are eager to breed in spring. Young can then, climate permitting, grow in spacious outdoor basins during summer. Like other Poecilia, they are prone to hybridization with their relatives. Not infrequently, crosses are attempted with the sailfin molly to breed a hardier fish. This is generally not very successful, and should not be attempted, as purebred Yucatan mollies are often quite hard to find, and hybrids will not have as massive dorsal fins as these. Several color variants are also available; these usually do not attain the large size of wild-type fish and may have been crossbred with P. latipinna.

In the very beginning the plot of the movie closely follows details of the independent investigation of the 1999 Russian apartment bombings described in the book Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within by Yury Felshtinsky and Alexander Litvinenko, representing them as parts of the plan masterminded and sponsored by exiled tycoon Pokrovsky (obvious hint at Boris Berezovsky in real life) and aimed to discredit Russian security services. As this plan has failed, Pokrovsky assisted by some terrorists organizes a hostage taking in a Moscow circus (very similar to Moscow theater hostage crisis in real life) in order to return to Russia, acting as a saver of the hostages during negotiations. However, he fails to do so. The movie also depicts the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia as a place where an important Islamic militant hides, which was a common allegation by Russian authorities in real life around that time, and depicts destruction of a base of terrorists and allies of Pokrovsky in Qatar which might hint at the assassination of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev.

Special education and limited-English proficiency students are included in the testing and may be accommodated with modifications. Tennessee has used TCAP tests since 1989‚Äì90. In 2010, a linking study was performed so that the TCAP could report out Lexile measures for students in grades 3-8 and 10. A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability. This Test was discontinued in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year because a private company developed the TNReady tests. TNReady was unsuccessful during the first school year because the company failed to provide testing materials to all students who were supposed to take the test, and testing in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year for Tennessee was canceled due to this. In the following school year, the state still used TNReady, but in paper form instead of electronic. The TNReady test was administered to all subjects above, except for science, which continued to be TNReady until the 2018‚Äì2019 school year. Soon after this unsuccessful attempt, TNReady tried again with electronic testing during the 2017‚Äì2018 school year. Contrary to the previous time, the system didn't discontinue; however, there was much lagging and several times where a student couldn't submit a test, delaying testing a week and a half past the previous end time. The paper test is administered with two different tests, given out to every other student so as to prevent cheating. Each test has multiple subparts. Language Arts has four subparts. The first is an essay based test, which is randomly selected to be either narrative, explanatory, or argumentative. The time allowed on this is 85 minutes. The second and third subparts are reading and vocabulary comprehension. The fourth subpart is grammar and mechanics, based similar to the SAT's style of this. Extra time can be allowed for children with specialized education plans, also including 504 and IEP students. The test times are extended, for most cases, the regular test time + 50%.

Over the decades, educational and treatment initiatives have been slowed by prevailing cultural values as well as severe economic hardships brought about by sanctions and war.  1986-2003  According to the Iraqi government, and a subsequent lawsuit, the pandemic came to Iraq via contaminated blood in 1986, with haemophiliacs being the initial victims.POZ - News : Iraq‚Äôs First HIV Lawsuit The Ba'athists relocated Iraqis found to be infected with AIDS-HIV to a segregated medical facility. No one was allowed to visit these facilities, patients were basically prisoners and were given secret burials. Ignorance about the disease was commonplace, even among the government itself. The former Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, wrongly believed that the disease could be spread through casual contact and felt that infected Iraqis should be exterminated or imprisoned. When the regime fell, these segregated hospitals were looted and the surviving patients were left to wander the streets.  Post-Ba'athist  As early as 2004 the United Nations IRIN news service reported on the challenges involved in AIDS-HIV treatment and education in Iraq. Almost no education existed regarding AIDS-HIV during the Ba'athist regime and thus a high degree of ignorance and fear surrounds the pandemic and its victims. The Iraqi government offers free medical services and financial assistance to all Iraqi citizens living with AIDS-HIV. This includes regular checkups for the infected person, along with checkups for their partners and family members. Public service announcements and some education in the schools have begun at a slow pace. Government health officials have some reason to be concerned, as some Muslim fundamentalist and sectarian militias have been known to harass and even kill infected Iraqis on the grounds that being infected with AIDS-HIV is evidence of sin. In Baghdad several clinics specialize in AIDS-HIV, while outside of the capital, there are similar clinics in each region, although there are still shortages in medical care. In 2005 representatives from the Iraqi Health Ministry traveled to Jordan to speak with public health officials about Jordanian efforts to stop the spread of the pandemic.FHI - Iraqi Study Tour In 2006 the government in northern Iraq, Kurdistan, began to deport foreigners found to be HIV-positive because the government does not have the resources of facilities to offer treatment to its own citizens, let alone foreigners. Ignorance about the pandemic remains widespread and it is taboo to discuss the ways in which the virus can be spread or to encourage the usage of condoms.Taboo on topic of AIDS handicaps health care / Low caseload makes getting affordable medications difficult References Iraq Health in Iraq ","title":"HIV/AIDS in Iraq"},{"id":"9641397","text":"Begun in 1981, ATYP ‚Äì Academically Talented Youth Programs ‚Äì is a K-12/higher education collaborative model that works cooperatively with over 60 public and private school districts. Seventh through ninth graders are assessed for their higher level math and verbal potential identified through the Midwest Academic Talent Search (MATS). They attend ATYP‚Äôs weekly 2.5-hour class. The students‚Äô SAT scores, rather than their grade level, indicate their readiness for the classes. Qualifying scores, set at levels similar to Talent Search‚Äô summer programs, use the SAT verbal score to indicate readiness for the writing/literature class. The SAT math score, and a combined math plus verbal score, qualify students for the math class. Because the program focuses on serving higher levels of potential, very few students qualify for both the English and the math class. The students‚Äô motivation to work hard alongside their commitment to the program‚Äôs rigor contribute to their ultimate success. Independent and small group work helps students complete the 6-8 hour weekly homework assignment. Housed on the campus of Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, ATYP provides fast-paced classes during the school year, in conjunction with the student‚Äôs regular school schedule. ATYP‚Äôs first two years cover pre-AP content; the third year focuses at the AP English Language and Composition / AP English Literature and Composition and Pre-Calculus / AP Statistics level. Because the course's students need to be challenged at all ages, not only at high school age, the ATYP model begins to identify students who will perform well in the classes at as early as 5th grade. Once identified, the students are invited to take the SAT or ACT to see if they can qualify.

These plants are distinctive spring wildflowers, which grow in moist, rich woodland, it is known for its large triple-compound leaf, and large blue, berry-like fruits. Unlike many spring wildflowers, it is not an ephemeral plant and persists throughout much of the summer. Common names for plants in this genus include blue cohosh, squaw root, and papoose root. As hinted at by its common names, this plant is well known as an alternative medicine for inducing childbirth and menstrual flow; it is also considered a poisonous plant.>Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases  Description  These large, smooth plants (0.3‚Äì0.9 m tall) have a single to few stems with each stem bearing normally one, but on large stems two, large triple-compound leaves which the casual observer might assume to be several smaller leaves arranged on three separate branches. Each leaflet ends in three to five distinct tips. Plants produce underground stems called rhizomes that give rise to the leaves each spring and in the fall when the foliage dies back a scar is left on the rhizome and a new bud is formed that will grow into the foliage next spring. Plants are long lived and can live for more than 50 years. They are found in wooded locations with moisture retentive soils. In April or May, each mature stem bears a spike of flowers. Each flower has six petal-like sepals which range from greenish-yellow to purple. The different rates of maturity between the stamens and the pistil ensure cross pollination. There are six fleshy nectar glands at the base of each sepal which attract pollinators. Each fertilized flower matures into a large (1 cm) deep-blue berry-like fruit which houses two bitter seeds. The large seeds are covered with a characteristic blue coat, and the fruits remain on the plants until fall. Seed germination can take a few years, and the seedlings are hypogeal, with the cotyledons remaining underground after germination and seedling emergence. The seedlings need a few years of growth before they are large enough to flower.  Species  All species in this genus are very similar. Until recently, this genus was considered to be composed of only two species, however the Flora of North America recognizes Caulophyllum giganteum, as a distinct species rather than a subspecies of Caulophyllum thalictroides.Flora of North America: Caulophyllum Caulophyllum giganteum is slightly larger, has a more northerly (but overlapping) distribution, and blooms two weeks earlier than Caulophyllum thalictroides.

Children should not be allowed to eat the attractive blue fruits, as these plants contain chemicals that are known to cause cell damage.Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System: Caulophyllum The powdered roots have been shown to cause dermatitis and irritation of the mucous membranes.  Food  Historically, the roasted seeds have been used as a coffee substitute; this beverage does not contain caffeine.  Medicine  Historically the root of Caulophyllum has been used as a medicine for: cancer, internal parasites, smooth muscle function, spasms, diuretic, menstruation, and childbirth. It is best known for the latter two uses. Various Native American tribes are also recorded as having used this plant for similar medicinal purposes.Native American Ethnobotany Database by D. Moerman While no current widely marketed medicines are based on this plant, modern herbalists and practitioners of alternative medicine still utilize this plant as a natural therapy.

First published in Graham's Magazine in November 1845, the story centers on a na√Øve and unnamed narrator's visit to a mental asylum in the southern provinces of France. Plot summary The story follows an unnamed narrator who visits a mental institution in southern France (more accurately, a \\"Maison de Sant√©\\") known for a revolutionary new method of treating mental illnesses called the \\"system of soothing\\". A companion with whom he is travelling knows Monsieur Maillard, the originator of the system, and makes introductions before leaving the narrator. The narrator is shocked to learn that the \\"system of soothing\\" has recently been abandoned. He questions this, as he has heard of its success and popularity, but Maillard tells him to \\"believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see\\". The narrator tours the grounds of the hospital and is invited to dinner, where he is joined by twenty-five to thirty other people and a large, lavish spread of food. The other guests are dressed somewhat oddly: though their clothes are well made, they do not seem to fit the people very well. Most of them are female and are \\"bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare\\". The table and the room are decorated with an excess of lit candles wherever it is possible to find a place for them. Dinner is also accompanied by musicians playing \\"fiddles, fifes, trombones and a drum\\", and though they seem to entertain all the others present, the narrator likens the music to horrible noises (at one point even mentioning the torture and execution device known as the brazen bull). The narrator says that there is much of the \\"bizarre\\" about everything at the dinner. Conversation as they eat focuses on the patients they have been treating. They demonstrate for the narrator the strange behavior they have witnessed, including patients who thought themselves a teapot, a donkey, cheese, champagne, a frog, snuff tobacco, a pumpkin, and others. Maillard occasionally tries to calm them down, and the narrator seems very concerned by their behavior and passionate imitations. He then learns that this staff has replaced the system of soothing with a much stricter system, which Maillard says is based on the work of a \\"Doctor Tarr\\" and a \\"Professor Fether\\". The narrator says he is not familiar with their work, to the astonishment of the others. It is finally explained why the previous system was abandoned: one \\"singular\\" incident, Maillard says, occurred when the patients, granted a large amount of liberty around the house, overthrew their doctors and nurses, usurped their positions, and locked them up as lunatics. These lunatics were led by a man who claimed to have invented a better method of treating mental illness, and who allowed no visitors except for \\"a very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid\\". The narrator asks how the hospital staff rebelled and returned things to order. Just then, loud noises are heard and the hospital staff breaks from their confines. It is revealed that the dinner guests are, in fact, the patients, who have just recently taken over. As part of their uprising, the inmates treated the staff to tarring and feathering. The keepers now put the real patients, including Monsieur Maillard (who had once been the superintendent before going mad himself), back in their cells, while the narrator admits that he has yet to find any of the works of Dr. \\"Tarr\\" and Professor \\"Fether\\". The \\"system of soothing\\" Monsieur Maillard's system avoids all punishments and does not confine its patients. They are granted a great deal of freedom and are not forced to wear hospital gowns, but instead are \\"permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind\\". The doctors have \\"humored\\" their patients by never contradicting their fantasies or hallucinations. For example, if a man thinks he is a chicken, doctors treat him as a chicken, giving him corn to eat. The system is apparently very popular. Monsieur Maillard says that all the \\"Maisons de Sant√©\\" in France have adopted it. The narrator remarks that after the patient revolt is crushed, the soothing system is reinstated at the asylum he has visited, though modified in certain ways that are intended to reform it. Publication history \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" was held by editors for several months before being published in Graham's Magazine for November 1845.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. p. 469. Analysis At the time this story was written, the care of the insane was a significant political issue in the United States.

He is remembered primarily for establishing the first museum in the United States dedicated solely to American art.  Early years  He was born in the industrial town of Temperance Furnace, Mercer County, Pennsylvania, the son of Joseph Green and Temperance (Orwig) Butler. His family's presence in the country traced back to the period preceding the American Revolution. Joseph G. Butler Jr.'s Anglo-Irish ancestors emigrated from the vicinity of Dublin to colonial America in 1759. According to Joseph G. Butler Jr.'s obituary, his father, Joseph Green Butler, was a \\"widely known iron manufacturer and blast furnace expert\\". His grandfather, Joseph Butler, established the first blast furnace in central Pennsylvania. When Butler was still a child, his family relocated to Niles, Ohio, where he attended a village school along with future president William McKinley.  Industrial career  Butler became involved in the iron business at the age of 30. In time, his industrial activities centered on Youngstown, Ohio, where he became a pivotal figure in the community's transition from iron to steel production.Blue, Frederick J. et al., Mahoning Memories: A History of Youngstown and Mahoning County (Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company, 1995), p. 94. In 1892, he joined local industrialist Henry Wick in the organization of the Ohio Steel Company, which built two Bessemer plants along the Mahoning River, just northwest of Youngstown. The company went into production in 1895, only to be sold four years later to the Pittsburgh-based National Steel Company. In 1901, the local plant became the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, part of the U.S. Steel Corporation. Butler's influence extended well beyond Ohio, however. By the early 20th century, he was a nationally known industrialist who served as director of the American Iron and Steel Institute, president of the Portage Silica Company, and a director of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, Pennsylvania & Lake Erie Dock Company, Youngstown and Suburban Railway Company, Pennsylvania and Ohio Power & Light Company, and Commercial National Bank of Youngstown. Among American industrialists, he was known affectionately as \\"Uncle Joe\\".  Civic contributions  Butler Institute of American Art Butler's most celebrated legacy is the Butler Institute of American Art, located near the modern-day campus of Youngstown State University. He established the institution in 1919, to house his personal collection of American art. The industrialist's commitment to this groundbreaking museum was reflected in his last will and testament. According to contemporary news accounts, Butler left the bulk of his $1,500,000 estate to the Butler Institute. Scarcely more than three decades after Butler's death, Time magazine published a feature story which described the art museum as \\"booming\\". In a passage that praised the late industrialist's vision as well as its realization, the magazine's editors wrote: \\"To set the strictly American tone of the place, he planted a befeathered bronze Indian in front of the $500,000 colonnaded building designed by the Manhattan firm of McKim, Mead & White. With Youngstown University nearby, the two blocks surrounding the museum soon developed into the cultural strip of the U.S.'s third biggest steel center\\". As a philanthropist and community leader, Butler was also instrumental in the conception and realization of other civic projects, including Niles' National McKinley Birthplace Memorial, a monument to the memory of his personal friend, President William J. McKinley. In addition, Butler was the author of several well-received historical works, including an overview of the development of the U.S. steel industry, a history of the Mahoning Valley, and a biography of President McKinley. His published works also include a volume titled, Presidents I Have Seen and Known. Butler was personally acquainted with every U.S. president from Abraham Lincoln to Calvin Coolidge.  Death  Joseph G. Butler Jr. died on the eve of his 87th birthday. A memorial service held at the Butler Institute of American Art featured a eulogy delivered by Youngstown educator O. L. Reid. The speaker highlighted Butler's rare combination of pragmatism and artistic sensibility when he stated, \\"His fathers were iron masters and surely in some of them must have been a keen rush of joy before the sheer beauty of the white flame of their furnaces\\". Butler's funeral services were held at St. John's Episcopal Church, in Youngstown, and his remains were interred at Belmont Park Cemetery, in nearby Liberty, Ohio.

History  The place where today is the Cathedral of Santa Ana was the central parish, which was built between 1575 and 1576, being destroyed by lightning in the 19th century. When the Diocese of Santa Ana was created preparations were made to rebuild the central parish of the city; this reconstruction was authorized in 1904 and began on January 21 of 1906. It was consecrated on February 11 of 1913. The construction, however, continued in the decades that followed until they were finally completed on February 24 of 1959, when the marble altar of the image of Saint Anne was consecrated and finished. On April 22 of 1995 was declared a National Monument. To this day this church is still open to the public.  Design  The building was designed as a Neo-Gothic cathedral, in contrast to the Spanish colonial style of most of the cathedrals in El Salvador and the rest of Latin America. It is formed by three naves, which are of the following measures: the central nave with 22 meters in length and 22 meters in width, the lateral naves measure 2 meters in length and eight meters in width ; together the three naves form a cross. The north tower offers three bells that are activated manually, while the south tower contains three bells that were brought from the Netherlands in 1949 and activated electronically.

Buller was born in Crediton, Devon, the only daughter of General Sir Redvers Buller and his wife, Lady Audrey, youngest daughter of the 4th Marquess Townshend. She joined the British Red Cross Society and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 she was Deputy County Director of the Voluntary Aid Organisation for Devon. She was asked to establish a hospital in Exeter; by August 1915 the original 160 beds had grown to over 1,400. Established as the Red Cross Voluntary Aided Hospital, in 1915 it was taken over by the War Office as the Central Military Hospital Exeter and Buller remained as administrator, the only woman to hold such a post in a major military hospital during the war. She was also responsible for forty-four affiliated auxiliary hospitals. By 1918 more than 35,000 patients had passed through the hospital. For her work she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours and also awarded the Royal Red Cross 1st Class (RRC). After the war, Buller began collecting funds to establish an orthopaedic hospital for children in Devon. In 1927 she opened the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter. In 1937 this was followed by the St Loye's Training Centre for Cripples (which later became St Loye's College for Training the Disabled and is now St Loye's Foundation), also in Exeter. In 1932 she opened the Cripple's Training College (which later became Queen Elizabeth's Training College and is now Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People), which is based in Leatherhead, Surrey.Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People website, qef.org.uk; accessed 26 March 2016. She also founded the British Council for Rehabilitation.

Origins of holistic approach He was inspired to conceptualize holistic medicine while a young doctor working for the Grenfell Mission, which served the fisherman families of Newfoundland and Labrador, traveling by dog sled and boat when necessary. \\"It was out of the ethers, or perhaps from God, that the words 'Treat the whole man, treat the whole man,' kept flashing through my mind, and they have been with me ever since. For the next eighteen years, I gave much thought as to the practical application of a therapy that would include the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of illness.\\" Because Evarts grew up in a spiritual, humanitarian, and global environment, he was already naturally applying these concepts at the medical mission. He used prayer and meditation, in particular, in conjunction with his mother Amy and later with other spiritual healers. Several other factors also contributed to his holistic world view. While working in this northern climate, Evarts had gained extensive surgical experience and was accepted as a fellow in the American College of Surgeons. While he loved surgery, he felt it was too limiting and chose instead to follow a career in family practice, which included surgery, and he became a fellow in the American College of Family Physicians. As an undergraduate at Haverford College, a Quaker school, Evarts read Holism and Evolution 1 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African statesman and soldier. This book also influenced his tendency toward holism. In addition, he was deeply impressed by his philosophy professor, the well- known Quaker mystic Rufus Jones, founder of the American Friends Service Committee. Early career It was at Haverford that Evarts as a third-year biology major happened to pick up a pamphlet about the career of Albert Schweitzer, whose life was dedicated to ameliorating the suffering of natives who had no access to skilled medical care. Evarts was taken by his concepts of \\"welt-anschauung\\" (world view) and \\"reverence for life.\\" That night, he picked up a phone and informed his parents that he was shifting to pre-med. World War II intervened before Evarts could begin pioneering a therapy of the whole person. The \\"bamboo curtain\\" also cut off the dream of Evarts and his wife Verna, an RN, to become medical missionaries in China. Evarts wanted his war service to focus on saving lives, and he served as a surgeon with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Association in Algeria. Bored by a lack of surgical cases, he requested and was assigned by the Friends Ambulance Unit (Quaker) to the bombed-out city of Tenchung, China. There, in a converted ancestor worship temple, he directed a hospital and clinic and, along with an international medical team, treated civilians, as well as Chinese and American military personnel. After two years, the Quakers turned over the work to the Chinese, and Evarts returned home to his wife and young daughter Margaret, both of whom came into his life while in Newfoundland. Since they had fallen in love with the state while studying Chinese at Berkeley, Verna had already arranged for Evarts to practice in Montebello, California, where their second daughter Laura was added to the family. Evarts also knew he needed a place where new ideas would be more accepted than in the more conservative parts of the US. Move to California While in China, he was impressed with the way the buildings fit into the landscape, and he was already familiar with the healing power of nature. He had seen in his mind a sanitarium located below a triangular mountain peak, and he and Verna began to search for a beautiful setting for their healing center. In 1952, they felt guided to purchase Friendly Hills Ranch in Hemet, California, beneath the spectacular - and triangular - Tahquitz Peak. They began inviting patients to their home for group discussions about what was going on in those patients' lives that might be contributing factors toward illness. They also began forming a non-profit foundation and a board of directors. Lacking money to construct a center, they eventually purchased Meadowlark, a property once owned by movie magnate Louis B. Mayer. In 1958, America's first holistic medical live-in retreat welcomed its first guest. The following year, Evarts inaugurated a series of three groundbreaking inter-professional conferences to explore the nature of the healing process. Those invited included physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, ministers, scientists, sociologists, business people, an artist, and a spiritual healer. In 1960, Evarts and his family made a trip around the world in search of teachers and advisors to guide his visionary work, since he could find few in the states with whom he could talk about holistic medicine. Twelve years later, he began a major shift from administering drugs to practicing homeopathy, and in 1973 he inaugurated a preceptorship program for medical students. Meadowlark At Meadowlark, Evarts and his staff avoided white coats so they would be indistinguishable from the guests, who stayed an average of two weeks. During the 33 years of operation, Evarts developed a basic treatment program, with the key modality being love. After a thorough medical examination, guests were given nutritional counseling and were encouraged to participate in an exercise program that might include swimming, walking, jogging, or bicycle riding. Guests were served primarily vegetarian food, much of which was grown in an organic garden on the grounds using the biodynamic principles developed by Rudolf Steiner. In addition to psycho-spiritual counseling, guests could participate in art and music therapy, classes on yoga and meditation, acupuncture treatments, bodywork, biofeedback training, and therapeutic fasts, all of which could lead to a deeper understanding of illness and healing. A favorite activity was the daily group-therapy session where dreams, journaling, and all other modalities were brought together and shared. Guests could always retreat to the interdenominational chapel at any time of the day or night or listen to inspirational tapes in the privacy of their rooms. Meditation was extremely popular, as was the meditation teacher, Amy Loomis, who inspired guests until the age of 98, and still does today through the 52 meditation tapes she created. \\"Spirit is where the energy flows, and all the modalities we used at Meadowlark encouraged this healing flow of energy,\\" said Evarts. Bringing exercise to the Meadowlark Program was natural for Evarts, having developed an early interest in birding and hiking. In order to fit in an hour of exercise while studying at Cornell Medical School, he would walk from his aunt and uncle's apartment across New York City's Central Park, while memorizing poetry from such works as Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. 2 As Evarts began to develop his exercise program, he combined elements from Thomas Cureton's Physical Fitness and Dynamic Health 3 (particularly the Standard Test of Physical Fitness), the Royal Canadian Air Force Plans for Physical Fitness,4 and Dr Kenneth Coopers's Aerobics. Evarts was well-grounded in the physical aspects of medicine while studying and training at Cornell, as well as a brief consideration of the new field of psychiatry. On his trip around the world, he visited the Bircher-Benner Hospital and Clinic in Zurich, which influenced his ideas about nutrition and the role of fasting in healing. Evarts also visited Max Bircher, the son of the founder of the famous Bircher- Benner institution. There, at the Landhaus Murpfli, he discovered a model for Meadowlark and expanded his concept of whole-person therapy. Evarts found fasting to be the best method for detoxification in the overall treatment of chronic illness, which was often associated with ingested and environmental toxins. \\"Frequently the people who came in with chronic illnesses had been to many other doctors and had exhausted all possibilities of healing, as well as their money. We never charged what it cost to operate Meadowlark and always had to raise funds,\\" said Evarts. American Holistic Medical Association In 1977, doctors C. Norman Shealy, Gladys Taylor McGarey, Bill McGarey, and Gerald Looney gathered at Meadowlark to lay the foundation for the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA), which led to the first conference held the following year in Denver, Colorado. Evarts remembers discussions about the spelling of holistic. \\"Was it to be with a 'w' or an 'h'? We decided on the 'h', since it is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word 'hal', which is the root of health, whole, holy, and heal, and is thus more inclusive.\\" At the time of Meadowlark's 25th anniversary celebration in 1983, Dr. Shealy, founding president of AHMA, designated Evarts as the \\"father (and grandfather) of holistic medicine\\" and stated that Meadowlark had served as a role model for most of the people in the holistic movement. In 1995, Evarts received the AHMA Pioneer Award, which recognizes outstanding contributors to the holistic health movement. Previous recipients include Dr Linus Pauling and Bill Moyers. Evarts is also a founding diplomate of the American Board of Holistic Medicine (ABHM), which offered its first exam in conjunction with the University of Colorado Medical School in 2000. Evarts, with Rev. J. Sig Paulson, authored one of the first books on holistic medicine, Healing for Everyone: Medicine of the Whole Person6, a classic work on the art of medicine, which is in its second paperback reprinting. He also wrote a biography of his mother and most important spiritual teacher, entitled Amy, The Search for the Treasure Within 7 and published excerpts from her manuscript \\"Lessons for the Aquarian Age\\" under the title, To Self Be True 8. In addition to writing books and articles, Evarts filmed many of the European teachers he met on his world trip. His film, Healing the Whole Person 9, includes the only images of the \\"father of psychosynthesis,\\" Roberto Assagioli, MD. Later life As executive director of Meadowlark, Evarts and his staff treated more than 6,000 guests before finishing his pioneering work in 1991. The overall program had considerable success in treating arthritis, cancer, and other chronic illnesses. For many years, Evarts was also a tireless international lecturer. He spoke at the first meeting of the British Holistic Medical Association, and while he and his wife Fay Loomis, MA, were lecturing in Calcutta, India, they were asked to help inaugurate the Indian Holistic Medical Association. Evarts and Fay were married in 1992, after Verna's death. Holding an MD, FACS, FACP, and ABHM, Evarts has served on several boards, been interviewed on radio and television, and received numerous honors. His most recent honor occurred at the 25th Silver Anniversary of the AHMA when 25 medical pioneers were recognized, including doctors Deepak Chopra, Larry Dossey, Christiane Northrup, Rachel Naomi Remen, and Bernie Siegel. Today Evarts and Fay jointly counsel, write, and lecture. As Evarts recently approached his 93rd birthday, he expressed his gratefulness at being able to influence and witness a therapy of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), which has gone through the pains of birth and adolescence and found its fruition in a specialty board-the ABHM. Evarts has summarized his life experiences and his vision for the future of medicine in his forthcoming book, \\"Return of the Priest-Physician: Medicine for the 21st Century\\" (Loomis, EG, to be published). Legacy Holistic practitioners, authors of books on holistic modalities, and those who have benefited from holistic treatment are all indebted to Evarts' unwavering pioneering spirit, his vision of holism, and his ability to synthesize it into a working model. For several years he struggled alone, in spite of criticism from traditional medicine‚Äîand even attempted arrests‚Äîto provide a template which is now rivaling mainstream medicine. Perhaps most important of all, he has lived the model that he created.[reference...?] \\"No one I know or know about so truly deserves to be termed 'pioneer' in this movement,\\" said Willis Harmon, late president of the Institute of Noetic Sciences. \\"When I first met Dr Loomis in the late 1950s, he had just started Meadowlark, and his philosophy and practice of holism impressed me as applying not only to medicine, but to all of life. Very few people at that time could foresee the revolution against reductionism, fractionalism, and positivism that began in the 1960s. Evarts not only saw the issues clearly, but created an influential demonstration of what the new way would mean in terms of 'health for the whole person.'\\" Evarts G Loomis's great-grandmother was Mary Evarts, was a sister of former United States Secretary of State, Attorney General and Senator William Maxwell Evarts.

David Sheridan was the inventor of the modern \\"disposable\\" plastic endotracheal tube now used routinely in surgery. Previous to his invention, red rubber tubes were used, then sterilized, and re-used which often lead to the spread of disease and also a high risk of infection. Sheridan is thus credited with saving thousands of lives. He held more than 50 medical instrument patents and is credited with inventing the modern disposable catheter in the 1940s. In his lifetime he started and sold four catheter companies and was dubbed the \\"Catheter King\\" by Forbes magazine in 1988. Sheridan died in upstate New York at the age of 95.

Begun in 2005, it has broadcast in many languages in conjunction with a television service operated from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. History Radio Luxembourg in English from 1933 to 1939 and from 1946 to 1992 was an important forerunner of modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. It was an effective way to advertise products by circumventing British broadcasting restrictions that were in place at the time. The English- language station broadcasting from the Grand Duchy closed down at the end of 1992. The DRM service In 2005 the parent RTL company stated that the AM transmissions would not resume but that a full-time English service would begin on Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM). During August of that year, the parent operating company of Radio Luxembourg conducted digital test broadcasts to the UK on 7145 kHz using DRM. This culminated in the soft re-launch of Radio Luxembourg in English at 07:00 BST on September 12, 2005. For a time Radio Luxembourg was heard at 7295 kHz DRM, but RTL has now discontinued DRM broadcasts on 7295 kHz throwing the future of the DRM station into doubt, although local DRM broadcasts are still on air in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Radio Luxembourg can also be heard with a live stream with a classic rock playlist. Its presenters include Lisa V, Benny Brown and Enda Caldwell. Radio Luxembourg was hoping to broadcast in English on one of the two new digital national DAB services in the UK during 2008, if National Grid Wireless Limited won the licence. However, National Grid Wireless failed to win the licence. The station continues as an online service, although the service has not been updated with any new audio programming since 31 December 2007.

W. Cole of the Book Arcade\\", (5 January 183216 December 1918) was a bookseller and founder of the Cole's Book Arcade, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Early life Cole was born at Woodchurch near Tenterden, Kent, England, son of Amos Cole, labourer, and his wife Harriett. He received little education, his father died young, and, after his mother had married again, the boy ran away to London. In 1850, with ¬£20, he migrated to the Cape Colony and had some success as a farmer and enjoyed botanical explorations.Duxbury, K. (2003), 'With Mirrors and Rainbows: Part 1‚Äô, Australian Garden History, 14 (6), pp. 20‚Äì24. In November 1852 he migrated to Victoria. He spent some time on the diggings at various jobs. Bookseller On 30 September 1865, Cole started a book shop at the Eastern market, Melbourne, with a stock of 600 volumes. His total takings at the end of October amounted to ¬£15 12s., most of which was spent in buying fresh stock. He gradually prospered and became lessee of the whole of the market, most of which was sub-let to small stall-holders. He engaged a band, spent a comparatively large sum on advertising, and made the market a popular resort. Though Cole had little education he read a great deal, and in 1867, under the pseudonym of \\"Edwic\\", he published The Real Place in History of Jesus and Paul, which is largely a discussion on the validity of miracles. The last paragraph of the book stated that it had been written largely to show what Jesus was not, and that he hoped to publish another book showing \\"what he really was and Paul also, namely that they were two honest visionaries\\". No one in Melbourne or Sydney would publish it. In 1874 Cole took a building fronting on Bourke Street near the market, and opened his first \\"book arcade\\". This business was successful and he also continued renting the market until 1881, when he was unable to secure a renewal of the lease on sufficiently favourable terms. He then began negotiations for a building lower down Bourke Street near the general post office. Cole's Book Arcade Interior of Cole's Book Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne Cole's Book Arcade was opened on 27 January 1883 and grew into one of the great book businesses of Australia. It became known as \\"the prettiest sight in Melbourne\\".Image ‚Äì Cole's Book Arcade ‚Äì Electronic Encyclopedia of Gold in AustraliaCole's Book Arcade ‚Äì Concept ‚Äì Electronic Encyclopedia of Gold in Australia Such was its renown that Cole's Book Arcade was visited by writers Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain during their travels to Australia.http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2011/3289272.htm The shop was extended to Little Collins Street and afterwards buildings on the other side were bought through to the Collins Street frontage. The statement that there was once a stock of two million books is manifestly absurd, but the arcade certainly had one of the largest stocks of books in the world. Members of the public were invited to walk through the arcade, and to spend as much time as they liked turning over the books or even reading them. A large second hand department was on the first floor, where a band played every afternoon. The business continued to prosper and Cole eventually opened various new departments including one of printing. Publications including Funny Picture Books He compiled a large number of popular books, of which the Cole's Funny Picture Book series, which was launched with great publicity on Christmas Eve 1879, and Cole's Fun Doctor were most successful, their sales running into many hundreds of thousands. Another publication (early 1900s) was Cole's Treasury of Song, A Collection of the Most Popular Songs [Old and New] containing about a thousand songs. Publications: Horticulture books Cole also had great success publishing gardening and horticultural literature. Cole‚Äôs Penny Garden Guide was abridged from the Law Somner and Co. Handbook to the Garden (1880), a device much used by Cole. His biggest garden success was Cole‚Äôs Australasian Gardening and Domestic Floriculture (1897) by William Elliott. He also published Hamilton McEwin‚Äôs The Fruitgrower‚Äôs Handbook, and reprinted others, such as John Lockley‚Äôs Rose Growing Made Easy, under his imprint. Cole‚Äôs The Happifying Gardening Hobby (1918), an endearing anthology of words and pictures, embodied his altruistic wish for universal health and happiness.Aitken, R., (2002), ‚ÄòCole, Edward William‚Äô, in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, p. 147. Historian Ken Duxbury describes this work as a ‚Äòsort of horticultural version‚Äô of Cole‚Äôs Funny Picture Book.Duxbury, K. (2003), ‚ÄòWith Mirrors and Rainbows: Part 2‚Äô, Australian Garden History, 15 (1), pp. 14‚Äì19. Cole also edited a booklet entitled Cotton Growing: the coming leading industry in Australia in 1905 and in 1913, the second edition of The Fruitgrower‚Äôs Handbook. Over the next two years, he published two works by A. E. Cole (no relation) The Bouquet: Australian flower gardening and The Australian Floral Almanac. Personal life and legacy Cole married Eliza Frances Jordan in 1875; she predeceased him, dying on 15 March 1911. They lived in a flat above the arcade. Cole himself died in Melbourne on 16 December 1918 and was buried in Boroondara Cemetery. Two sons and three daughters survived him. Cole's establishment had a considerable effect on the culture of Melbourne. The business was continued for about 10 years after his death, when the executors decided to close it and sell the properties, which had now become very valuable. A member of his family bought the goodwill, and the shop was continued for another 10 years in Swanston Street on a comparatively small scale. ReferencesFurther reading * at gutenberg.net.au *E.

Boyce had won the seat only at the 1992 general election, but it had been continuously held by Labour since 1933, usually with a large majority. As a result, Labour were clear favourites to hold at the by-election. Labour decided to stand Denis MacShane, the director of the European Policy Institute. A former journalist and trade union employee, he had unsuccessfully contested Solihull at the October 1974 general election. The Conservative Party had taken a distant second place in 1992, and having lost the previous two by-elections of the term to the Liberal Democrats, they were not hopeful of gaining ground. They chose to stand Nick Gibb, a chartered accountant working for KPMG. The Liberal Democrats had taken less than one eighth of the votes cast in 1992, a significant decrease from the previous election. Despite this, they stood the same candidate, David Wildgoose. Two other candidates stood: Screaming Lord Sutch of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, and Keith Laycock of the Natural Law Party. Results As expected, MacShane easily won the seat, although, disappointingly for the main opposition party, his vote was more than eight percent down on Boyce's. Wildgoose improved his fortunes, more than doubling his vote, and taking second place. Gibb took less than ten percent of the votes, falling to a distant third place. Sutch was able to record his best ever result, taking 1,114 votes and a 4.2% share - within a percentage point of the Loonies retaining a deposit for the first time. At the 1997 general election, MacShane retained the seat, with an increased majority. Wildgoose also stood, but proved unable to equal his performance in 1994, and by 2001 moved to contest Wentworth. At the Rotherham by-election of 2012, Wildgoose contested the seat again, though on this occasion as an English Democrat, ironically polling more votes than the Liberal Democrat candidate. Gibb became one of the few new Conservatives to enter Parliament in 1997, winning Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Sutch stood in several subsequent by-elections, but was never able to beat his total in Rotherham.

Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172 (1999), was a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the usufructuary rights of the Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribe to certain lands it had ceded to the federal government in 1837. The Court ruled that the Ojibwe retained certain hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the ceded land. Background Under the authority of the Treaty of St. Peters of 1837 (), also known as the \\"White Pine Treaty,\\" the Ojibwe (Chippewa) Nations ceded a vast tract of lands stretching from what now is north-central Wisconsin to east-central Minnesota. Article 5 of the treaty states, \\"The privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering the wild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territory ceded, is guaranteed to the Indians, during the pleasure of the President of the United States.\\" The states of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin were later formed from various ceded territories, including the large tract from the White Pine Treaty. The government officials of these states asserted authority over hunting and fishing rights without regard for the treaty rights reserved by the Ojibwe. From the 1960s to the 1990s, various bands of Ojibwe attempted to reassert their fishing rights on the Great Lakes. Those who did so were commonly arrested or harassed. This led to a series of lawsuits and protracted legal battles in each of the three states. The conflict culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Minnesota v. Mille Lacs (1999). Decision The Court affirmed the rights of the Ojibwe to hunt, fish, and gather on the lands ceded by treaty, contingent upon a set of guidelines to protect the Great Lakes fisheries. This decision is an important victory for proponents of Native American sovereignty.

He was also the uncle of American actress Lauren Tom. Early life and education Mr. Tom was the youngest of eight children. His mother, Lillian Goo, married Tom Y. Chan after her sister, Mary Goo, Tom Y. Chan's first wife, died from influenza. Mary Goo had two children: Florence and Grace. Lillian had six children: Priscilla, Helene, Eunice, Mary, Tom (Chung) and Ping. Mr. Tom attended Haines School in Chinatown. He then won a high-school scholarship to Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. Mr. Tom won the Parker scholarship over his best friend, Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr., who went on to become the first African-American astronaut. Mr. Tom graduated from Parker in 1952. Both of his sons, Darryl (Class of 1988) and Curtis (Class of 1990), as well as Trace Lawrence (Class of 1977), Mr. Lawrence's son, also attended Francis W. Parker School. In an article Mr. Tom wrote for the Parker Weekly in 1988, he stated that his experience at Parker shaped and influenced his life in two ways. First, Parker's atmosphere of encouragement helped him build self-confidence. Second, Parker's diversity taught him to develop \\"mutual respect and caring for those of a different race, ethnicity and religion.\\" In fact, he noted that he had not known a Jew until he attended Parker.Tom, Ping, Parker's student newspaper, The Weekly, November 16, 1988.

Mr. Tom was an advisor to U.S. Senators (Paul Simon, Carol Moseley-Braun), Illinois governors (James R. Thompson, Jim Edgar), and Chicago mayors (the late Harold Washington and Richard M. Daley).

As president of the Chinese American Development Corporation, founded in 1984, he unfortunately did not have the chance to see the bustling development that it has become.

Biography Charles Woodruff Shields was born in New Albany, Indiana on April 4, 1925. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) in 1844 and at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1847. He married Charlotte Elizabeth Bain on November 22, 1848, and remarried to Elizabeth Kane on April 25, 1861. After holding two pastorates he returned (1866) to Princeton College to take up the position of professor of the harmony of science and revealed religion, which had been established for him. In 1898 he took orders in the Episcopal church, but retained his chair until his death. In 1861 he produced an essay entitled Philosophia Ultima. This was in effect a manifesto for a grand unity of academic disciplines, setting forth a scheme of scholarship which should fully reconcile science and Christian religion, which he considered the academic culture of the United States uniquely qualified to advance. His studies at Princeton resulted in the expansion of this essay into The Final Philosophy, or system of perfectible knowledge issuing from the harmony of science and religion (1877), and eventually in Philosophia Ultima (three volumes, 1888‚Äì1905), with a memoir by William Milligan Sloane. He also published: * The Book of Common Prayer as Amended by the Presbyterian Divines of 1661 (1864; second edition, 1883) * The Order of the Sciences (1882) * The Scientific Evidences of Revealed Religion (1900), Paddock lectures.

The plot focuses on actors and married couple Jennie Malone and James O'Connor, who tour the country in popular melodramas. Much of the action consists of elaborate spoofs of the type of entertainment offered to audiences in the early 20th century. Background In the late 1950s, the project began as an account of actress Laurette Taylor's early life and career, based on a biography written by her daughter Marguerite Courtney. While it was still in its early stages, a non- musical adaptation of the book starring Judy Holliday closed after a week in New Haven. Undaunted, the creative team forged ahead, tailoring what was then called Blood and Thunder specifically for the talents of Mary Martin who, with her husband Richard Halliday, agreed to produce the show with Cheryl Crawford. Martin and Halliday financed half of the $500,000 production costs and Crawford and Alan Pakula the other half.Zolotow, Sam. \\"Two Leading Men Signed by Jennie\\", The New York Times, April 30, 1963, p. 27 S.

The play has repeatedly been acclaimed both as one of Shirley's best comedies and one of the best works of its generation.Nathan Coggan, \\"James Shirley's The Example (1634): Some Reconsiderations,\\" Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900, Vol. 17 No. 2 (Spring 1977), pp. 317-31. And it provides one of the clearest demonstrations in Shirley's canon of the influence of the works of Ben Jonson on the younger dramatist's output.Mina Kerr, The Influence of Ben Jonson on English Comedy, 1598-1642, New York, D. Appleton, 1912; pp. 45-51. The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 24 June 1634. Like the majority of Shirley's plays, The Example was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. The 1637 quarto was printed by John Norton for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, the stationers who issued five plays by Shirley in that year alone. The quarto shows signs of having been printed from the author's working drafts or \\"foul papers,\\" making it highly unusual among the early printed editions of Shirley's plays.David Stevens, \\"The Stagecraft of James Shirley.\\" Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 29 No. 4 (December 1977), pp. 493-516; see p. 495. Synopsis The drama portrays a profligate lord named Fitzavarice, and his involvement with Sir Walter Peregrine and his wife. Pressed by massive debts, especially to Lord Fitzavarice, Sir Walter takes up soldiering and becomes a captain. While Captain Peregrine is absent on his military service, Fitzavarice attempts to seduce Mistress Peregrine, offering to discharge her husband's debts if she submits to him. She resists his importunities, and faints when he tries to force her. Guilt and embarrassment work a reformation on him: Fitzavarice presents her with the mortgage, and adds a precious jewel in admiration of her steadfastness. At this critical juncture Sir Walter returns, having travelled home clandestinely, risking arrest for debt. Learning about the surrender of the mortgage, he assumes the worst and challenges Fitzavarice to a duel. The Lord accepts, but his second, a follower named Confident Rapture, arranges for the Captain to be apprehended for debt and so save his master the risks of single combat. Fitzavarice, however, pays the Captain's remaining debts and arranges for his release from prison. Peregrine now realizes his error and accepts his wife's virtue; but when he attempts to reconcile with Fitzavarice, the Lord refuses him, and insists that they meet on the \\"field of honor.\\" When both are wounded in their combat, the demands of honor are satisfied; the two men become friends. The Example employs the multiple-plot structure typical of Shirley's plays. The secondary plot (or first subplot) involves the comical suitors that are a fixture of Shirley's comic domain. Jacinta has two ridiculous rival suitors, Vainman and Pumicestone. She playfully torments them, insisting that Vainman never speak in her presence, while Pumicestone must do the opposite of whatever she commands. Jacinta is also courted by Confident Rapture, who has a sinister plan to prostitute her to Lord Fitzavarice; and by the Lord himself, who loves her sincerely. The third-level plot concerns the uncle of Mistress Peregrine and Jacinta, Sir Solitary Plot, \\"a character compounded of Jonson's Morose in Epicene and Jonson's Sir Politic Would-Be in Volpone.\\"Arthur Huntington Nason, James Shirley, Dramatist: A Biographical and Critical Study, New York, 1915; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1967; pp. 258-9. The result is an interesting study of paranoia in a 17th-century context: Sir Solitary sees enemies everywhere, and hides in his residence for safety. His servants Dormant and Oldrat are similar Jonsonian \\"humors\\" characters. Sir Solitary is jolted out of his obsession by a real but beneficent plot, engineered by Jacinta.

He held the post of New South Wales government statistician for 19 years, and served various periods as Agent- General for New South Wales in London from 1905 to his death in 1926.Neville Hicks, 'Coghlan, Sir Timothy Augustine (1855 - 1926)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 8, MUP, 1981, pp 48-51. Early life Coghlan was born in Sydney, the second son of Thomas Coghlan of Irish Roman Catholic extraction. He was educated at Cleveland Street Public School and Sydney Grammar School, and in 1873 joined the public works department, becoming assistant-engineer of harbours and rivers in 1884. Statistical career When the New South Wales department of statistics was created, Coghlan was appointed government statistician and began his duties early in 1886. The appointment was much criticized, but Coghlan held the position for 19 years and showed great industry and ability. He published in 1887 the first issue of The Wealth and Progress of New South Wales which continued to appear almost at yearly intervals. Other work Coghlan was also registrar of Friendly Societies from 1892 to 1905, a member of the public service board from 1896 to 1900, chairman of board of old age pensions 1901-5, and was president of the economics and statistics section at the 1902 meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. In December 1905, Coghlan was offered the chance to become the inaugural Commonwealth Statistician, heading the newly created Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. In February 1906, he informed Prime Minister Alfred Deakin that he could not accept the offer due to his obligations to the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Carruthers. He later told Deakin that Carruthers had threatened to withdraw his pension entitlements if he accepted the federal position. In 1905 Coghlan was appointed Agent-General for the state of New South Wales at London and held the position until his death apart from three short breaks. Coghlan was well qualified for this role and to deal with the many loans floated in London. Coghlan also promoted emigration to Australia. He published in 1918 in four volumes, Labour and Industry in Australia from the first Settlement in 1788 to the Establishment of the Commonwealth in 1901. Coghlan was serving as Agent-General when he died suddenly at London on 30 April 1926. His funeral was held at St Mary's, Cadogan Street, with his remains placed at Kensal Green Cemetery. In 1897 he married Helen Donnelly (d. 1936), the daughter of Denis Donnelly, who survived him with a son, Arthur, and a daughter, Ellen. Coghlan left them an estate of the value of ¬£43,197. Coghlan was awarded the Imperial Service Order (ISO) in 1903, was knighted in 1914 and created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1918.

One component is known as the A subunit, and the remaining five components are B subunits. All of these toxins share a similar structure and mechanism for entering targeted host cells. The B subunit is responsible for binding to receptors to open up a pathway for the A subunit to enter the cell. The A subunit is then able to use its catalytic machinery to take over the host cell's regular functions.  Families  Ribbon diagram of cholera toxin. From .Ribbon diagram of pertussis toxin. S1 is the A subunit, and S2-S5 make up the B subunit.Ribbon diagram of shiga toxin (Stx) from Shigella dysenteriae, showing the characteristic AB5 structure. A subunit is in orange and B-subunit complex is in blue. From . There are four main families of the AB5 toxin. These families are characterized by the sequence of their A (catalytic) subunit, as well as their catalytic ability.  Cholera toxin  This family is also known as Ct or Ctx, and also includes the heat-labile enterotoxin, known as LT. Cholera toxin's discovery is credited by many to Dr. Sambhu Nath De. He conducted his research in Calcutta (now Kolkata) making his discovery in 1959, although it was first purified by Robert Koch in 1883. Cholera toxin is composed of a protein complex that is secreted by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Some symptoms of this toxin include chronic and widespread watery diarrhea and dehydration that, in some cases, leads to death.  Pertussis toxin  This family is also known as Ptx and contains the toxin responsible for whooping cough. Pertussis toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. Whooping cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis was first identified as the cause of whooping cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.Guiso N. 2009.Bordetella pertussis and pertussis vaccines. Clin. Infect. Dis. 49:1565‚Äì1569 The toxin shares its mechanism with cholera toxin. ArtAB toxin of Salmonella enterica has components similar to those found in two different families: the ArtA () subunit is homologous with pertussis toxin A, while the ArtB () subunit is homologous with subB as well as proteins found in other Salmonella strains. Under the categorize-by-A rule, it is a Ptx-family toxin.  Shiga toxin  Shiga toxin, also known as Stx, is a toxin that is produced by the rod shaped Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli (STEC). Food and drinks contaminated with these bacteria are the source of infection and how this toxin is spread. Symptoms include abdominal pain as well as watery diarrhea. Severe life- threatening cases are characterized by hemorrhagic colitis (HC). The discovery of shiga toxin is credited to Dr. Kiyoshi Shiga in 1898.  Subtilase cytotoxin  This family is also known as SubAB and was discovered during the 1990s. It produced by strains of STEC that do not have the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), and is known to cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). It is called a subtilase cytotoxin because its A subunit sequence is similar to that of a subtilase-like serine protease in Bacillus anthracis. Some symptoms caused by this toxin are a decrease in platelet count in the blood or thrombocytopenia, an increase in white blood cell count or leukocytosis, and renal cell damage. The subtilase cytotoxin A subunit (subA, ) is a protease known to cleave binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death. The B subunits (subB, ) bind to N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) glycans on cells with high affinity. Just subB is sufficient to cause vacuolation of vero cells. Neu5GC is not made by humans but is acquired from food sources such as red meat and dairy products, also frequent sources of STEC infections, into the human gut lining.  Structure  A complete AB5 toxin complex contains six protein units. Five units are similar or identical in structure and they comprise the B subunit. The last protein unit is unique and is known as the A subunit. General diagram of the A subunit of the AB5 toxin with the disulfide linkage.Ribbon diagram of the B-subunit of the cholera toxin.  A subunit  The A subunit of an AB5 toxin is the portion responsible for catalysis of specific targets. For Shiga toxin family, the A subunit hosts a Trypsin-sensitive region which gives out two fragmented domains when cleaved. This region has not been confirmed for the other AB5 toxin families as yet. In general, the two domains of the A subunit, named A1 and A2, are linked by a disulfide bond. Domain A1 (approximately 22kDa in cholera toxin or heat labile enterotoxins) is the part of the toxin responsible for its toxic effects. Domain A2 (approximately 5kDa in cholera toxin or heat labile enterotoxin) provides a non-covalent linkage to the B subunit through the B subunit's central pore. The A1 chain for cholera toxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NAD) to arginine or other guanidine compounds by utilizing ADP- ribosylation factors (ARFs). In the absence of arginine or simple guanidino compounds, the toxin mediated NAD+ nucleosidase (NADase) activity proceeds using water as a nucleophile.  B subunit  The B subunits form a five- membered or pentameric ring, where one end of the A subunit goes into and is held. This B subunit ring is also capable of binding to a receptor, usually a glycoprotein or a glycolipid, on the surface of the host cell. Without the B subunits, the A subunit has no way of attaching to or entering the cell, and thus no way to exert its toxic effect. Cholera toxin, shiga toxin, and SubAB toxin all have B subunits that are made up of five identical protein components, meaning that their B subunits are homopentamers. Pertussis toxin is different where its pentameric ring is made up of four different protein components, where one of the components is repeated to form a heteropentamer.  Mechanisms  Cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, and shiga toxin all have their targets in the cytosol of the cell. After their B subunit binds to receptors on the cell surface, the toxin is enveloped by the cell and transported inside either through clathrin-dependent endocytosis or clathrin- independent endocytosis. The mechanism pathways for the four AB5 toxins: cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, shiga toxin, and subtilase cytotoxin. For the cholera toxin, the principal glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the Golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In order for the A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) that is in the endoplasmic reticulum. Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms. The pertussis toxin does not have a specific receptor, and binds to sialylated glycoproteins. After endocytosis, pertussis toxin's mechanism is the same as cholera toxin. The main receptor for the shiga toxin is globotriaosylceramide or Gb3. Shiga toxin is also brought to the golgi apparatus before being directed to the endoplasmic reticulum for PDI to cleave the disulfide bond. Shiga toxin's A subunit is then brought back into the cytosol and inhibits eukaryotic protein synthesis with its RNA N-glycosidase activity by cleaving a specific adenine base on 28S ribosomal RNA that will ultimately cause cell death. SubAB's target is in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell and is brought into the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The glycan receptor for SubAB usually ends with an Œ±2-3-linked N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). SubAB has an A subunit where it acts as a serine protease and cleaves Bip/GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. The cleavage of this chaperone causes cellular stress through protein inhibition, and consequently death of the cell.  Medical uses =Cancer treatment B subunits of the AB5 toxins have the affinity towards binding glycan which some type of tumors seem to possess making it an easy target. One example is that of StxB which specifically binds with CD77 (Gb3) which shows expression on the surface of cancerous cells such as colon, pancreas, breast, and many more. Once StxB targets a cancerous cell, it delivers the A subunit of the toxin which eventually kills the cancerous cell. Gastric Helicobacter pylori microcolony formationYet another method is by using ER stress-inducing drugs which have been tested in mice to show positive synergistic responses. This is accomplished through fusion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with SubAB's A subunit. Cancer cells that express receptors for EGF will then experience SubAB toxicity. Vaccines Another use of AB5 toxins is using members of the LT family as adjuvants. This allows the toxin to promote immunological responses such as IgG2a, IgA, and Th17 to fight for instance gastric Helicobacter pylori infection when a vaccine is given. In addition to some of these AB5 toxins being used to create vaccines to prevent bacterial infection, they are also being researched to work as a conjugate to prevent viral infections. For example, systemic immunization along with co-administered intra-nasal delivery of virus-cholera toxin conjugate vaccine induced a virus- specific antibody response and showed some degree of protection to the upper respiratory tract from Sendai virus. Recent areas of research New advancements in biotechnological experimental methods such as the use of Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy and FRET-based sensor molecules can better demonstrate dynamic structures of gap junction plaques. For these experiments, different types of AB5 toxins can be used to induce the fast formation of tCDR in E.Coli cells. The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs could perhaps be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the gap junction plaques. This can further help us understand the signaling cascade that follows a cellular loss of K+ when exposed to bacterial infection. The SubAB toxin has been seen to demonstrate specificity to a binding protein, BiP. This characteristic has been utilized to study the role of the cellular BiP itself, along with Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation in stressed HeLa cells.

Description Corridor is used by Via to refer to all Via inter-city passenger trains which start and end within the geographic region known as the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor. Other inter-city trains from outside the Corridor may have their terminus at stations in the Corridor, such as the Canadian and the Ocean, but are marketed by their respective train names and are not considered to be Corridor services. The Corridor service area has the heaviest passenger train frequency in Canada, with 36 Via trains traversing the route daily. About 67% of Via's revenue comes from Corridor routes. Via runs a mix of local-service and express trains in the Corridor. Most of the trackage is owned by the Canadian National Railway (CN Rail), although Via also owns three former freight lines, one from Smiths Falls, Ontario to Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec via Ottawa; one from Chatham, Ontario to Tecumseh, Ontario; and one from Smiths Falls to Brockville, Ontario. Prior to Via's formation in 1978, CN Rail operated its passenger trains, branded Rapido, on the same tracks and CP Rail also offered limited service. All trains are identified by number; however, prior to 2009 these trains were named as well.  High speed proposal  During the 1970s and early 1980s, CN and later Via Rail operated the Turbo Train on existing freight rail trackage. This equipment was later replaced by the Bombardier LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) train sets. Beginning in the 1980s and through the 1990s, Via Rail, Bombardier and the provincial and federal governments studied the feasibility of establishing a dedicated high-speed passenger rail network linking Quebec City‚ÄìMontreal‚ÄìOttawa‚ÄìToronto‚ÄìWindsor similar to the French TGV as a means of reducing domestic air and highway travel between these destinations. After a hiatus of ten years, a feasibility study on launching a high-speed rail service in the Corridor will be updated at the joint cost of the federal government, Ontario and Quebec. On November 14, 2011, the three governments officially released the final report of a high-speed rail study for this corridor. Improvements In 2009‚Äì2010, Via used C$300 million of government stimulus money to upgrade segments of the Corridor. Notable track improvements planned were an additional of third main track in four segments, and a short segment of fourth main track, as well as additional yard tracks at three locations. Improvements were made to several stations along the line, with new station buildings being constructed at Belleville and Cobourg, and additional platforms for existing stations at Brockville and Oshawa. The improvements were planned to reduce delays along the route and to allow for a reduction in travel time of up to 30 minutes from end to end. They were intended to allow Via to introduce two new round-trip trains from Toronto to both Montreal and Ottawa without requiring the acquisition of new equipment.  Primary inter-city routes The Maple Leaf, a through service from Toronto to New York City, operated jointly with Amtrak, is crewed by Via as trains 97 and 98 on VIA schedules, between Toronto and Niagara Falls, and can be considered part of Corridor services as well. It is the only scheduled rail service from the Corridor line at Burlington to Niagara Falls. Commuter rail A GO Transit train on the main line in Toronto's west end Two commuter rail agencies, provincially funded and independent of Via, share tracks with Via's Corridor trains. * The GO Transit Kitchener line shares tracks with Via trains for its entire route from Toronto Union Station to Kitchener Station. * The GO Transit Lakeshore West line shares tracks with Via trains from Toronto Union Station to Bayview junction, just west of Aldershot Station.

It is used for both minilab wet silver halide digital printers of the types most common today in photo labs and drug stores, and for prints made with older-type optical enlargers and manual processing. More specifically, common color photographic paper is carefully exposed to form a latent image of the picture, and then the paper is run through the series of chemicals that together comprise the RA-4 process to convert the latent image into the final print. RA-4 uses Color Developing Agent 3, in combination with color couplers in the emulsion to generate color dyes. RA-4 is a standardized chromogenic process used worldwide to make prints with a variety of equipment, photographic paper, and chemicals. Kodak created the RA-4 process for its color negative photographic papers. Fuji, Agfa, and other present and past photographic supply companies also make or have made both papers that are compatible with the Kodak chemicals, and chemicals that are compatible with the Kodak papers. These other companies typically call their equivalent processes by other names, but to most photographers, RA-4 is used as a generic term. The actual chemical process occurs at 100 degrees F, the paper (glossy or matte) is taken though color developer, then brief wash then via roller system into bleach/fix and then, chemicals are washed out of the paper via water, and since the paper is Resin Coated, it dries flat and even. The prints can be processed in photolab, or rotary tubes or trays by the photo hobbyist in a darkroom setting. Current manufacturers of RA-4 Chemistry include Kodak, Freestyle, Rollei, Unicolor and Tetenal as of 2017. The result of RA-4 processing is a Type C print.

Plot summary Golden has revealed some things about the plotline in an interview with Slayerlit: :\\"Once upon a time, all of the demonic and monstrous races, and the old gods, would choose ambassadors to send to the Dark Congress, which would take place under a general truce once every hundred years. The world is populated by demons from dark dimensions and many other supernatural beings and breeds, and they all have different attitudes toward humanity and the world. Some want to leave to return to their home dimensions, some to conquer this one; some want to live in peace with human beings, and others want to eat them.\\"Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007). The story takes place after the seventh season of Buffy. The Congress has not met for 500 years, having failed to come to an agreement. The story starts as Micaela, a Watcher, unknowingly releases the demon, Kandida, one of the leaders of the Dark Congress. Then, we find Buffy, and Xander in Providence, Rhode Island, trekking to the location of the city's own Hellmouth. There, they meet Trabajo the Sand demon, from whom they nearly escape. Meanwhile, in Greece, Willow is living happily with Kennedy, until she returns to their apartment to find Kennedy has cheated on her with a newbie Slayer. Completely broken-hearted, Willow immediately leaves and heads to Athens to clear her mind, there she meets a very ancient witch named Catherine, who promises Willow her heart's desire if she will be her apprentice. She gives Willow a very powerful scroll and her witch's familiar, a ginger cat. With a very ancient spell Willow is able to resurrect her former lover Tara Maclay, with whom the familiar shares a body. Willow and Tara have an emotional reunion. Elsewhere, former Scooby, Oz, is approached by an elder werewolf, who tells him that he is needed in Providence. Faith, who is now in San Francisco, finishes off vamps in the city, gets a message from a vamp who is a minion of an ancient vampiress named Harmann and decides to head back to New England, to Rhode Island, to meet up with Buffy. She arrives there and is attacked by The Gentlemen (of the Buffy Season 4 episode, \\"Hush\\"). She defeats them and remeets Xander, and has a sisterly reunion with \\"B\\". Giles, in England, has heard of all of the supernatural activity centered on Providence and he and Micaela travel to Rhode Island. Willow decides to bring Tara to meet Buffy and Xander, and Oz also heeds the older wolf's orders and goes to Providence. The Scoobies have a very happy reunion, especially with the resurrection of Tara (of which both Buffy and Giles are highly skeptical). They learn of the Dark Congress which is in session above the once active hellmouth in Providence, and the court of Demons want Buffy to be their arbiter. The Sand demon Trabajo is reunited with his lover, Kandida, but the two have a short reunion when Kandida's heart is ripped out. Trabajo is about to accuse a few of the members of the Congress and attack them, which would send the Congress in chaos and start an inevitable apocalypse. Buffy must keep that from happening by finding Kandida's killers and bringing them before the Council before Trabajo has a chance at them. The suspects are; Haarmann, the ancient vampiress; Willow's new suspicious and very intimidating teacher, Catherine; and Malik a rogue \\"Champion\\" for The Powers that Be, and his group of warriors who will kill anything connected to demons, including demons who aren't harmful, and even Slayers. Buffy is horrified and disgusted to be included. After all she is not a demon...is she? She knows so little about her powers that she can't say for certain where they truly spring from. How can she spend so much time wallowing in the darkness without becoming part of it? Can she possibly agree to a truce with all the horrors of the world, and allow them to come to Providence without any attempt to stop them? Does she have a choice? Meanwhile, can Willow and Tara come to terms with their denial that Tara's resurrection is anything but unnatural? Continuity=Characters *Confirmed characters include Buffy, Xander, Willow, Faith, Oz, Giles, and a resurrected Tara. *New characters include, watcher Micaela, Trabajo, Kandida, and Malik & his group of Champions. Timing *Intended to be set after BtVS's seventh season. Golden has commented, \\"Set a couple of months after season seven's wrap-up.\\" Canonical Issues Buffy novels such as this one are not usually considered canon by the fans. Some consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while others think of them as taking place in an alternate reality. However, these novels are not mere fan fiction, as overviews which summarize their plots are approved early on by both FOX and Joss Whedon (or at least his office). The books are then published as official Buffy/Angel merchandise. *Joss Whedon's canonical Buffy the Vampire Slayer season eight comics series may leave the novel out of canonical continuity. Golden has said \\"with Joss bringing the comics back with his own season eight, all I could do was try to go by the few glimpses we've had of that storyline. But the novels have always had their own continuity which is not the same as, but is parallel to and as similar as possible to the official continuity.\\" When asked about Season Eight's influence, he stated \\"I knew almost nothing about the comics before the manuscript was out of my hands. I'd seen only a few sample pages of Season 8, and tried to do what I could to keep it in line with what I learned from those few pages.\\" *Golden has said that Dark Congress is not canonical with the other post-S7 Buffy novel, Nancy Holder's Queen of the Slayers. *The only allusion to the official Season 8 Comics, is Buffy stating that Dawn is taking care of their Headquarters in Scotland.

Funding is provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and technical assistance is provided by the Library of Congress.UNITED STATES NEWSPAPER PROGRAM (Preservation, Library of Congress) The program has since been enhanced by the National Digital Newspaper Program. The program began in 1982 and was estimated to be completed in 2007.National Digital Newspaper Program As of 2004, $51.1 million in federal and $19.3 million in state funding had been raised.  Purpose  The initiators of the project asserted that the intellectual content of newspapers serves an important role for researchers as it is for all intents and purposes the first draft of history. Newspapers also provide unique access to \\"diverse geographic viewpoints at the community level.\\"The U.S. Newspaper Program - Scope, Achievement, and Progress Problematically, since the middle of the 19th century this \\"first draft\\" has been recorded on poor quality newsprint which is decaying rapidly. Through microfilming the intellectual content, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress hoped to preserve it and improve accessibility.  Scope  The U.S. Newspaper Program has supported (and continues to support) projects in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each project is conducted by a single organization or agency within a state or territory, usually the state's largest newspaper repository.United States Newspaper Program Holdings from a large variety of repositories are catalogued. This includes public libraries, county courthouses, newspaper offices, historical museums, college and university libraries, archives, and historical societies. In addition to these state projects, the United States Newspaper Program funded cataloging of newspapers at eight national repositories one of which also received funding for preservation. Records are entered into a national database maintained at the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) \\"and accessible through more than 53,500 dedicated computer terminals worldwide. Microfilm copies of newspapers are available to researchers anywhere in the country through the inter-library loan program.\\"  Standards  It is imperative that the program create microfilmed surrogates that \\"maintain the integrity and authenticity of the representation of the original document.\\" Anything less could potentially result in the destruction of history. As such, in order to participate in the U.S. Newspaper Program, institutions must agree to adhere to an array of stringent standards. The standards for both microfilming and preservation were largely set by the Library of Congress.  Criticism  The most outspoken critic of the United States Newspaper Program is the author Nicholson Baker. Baker argues that the microfilming done for this project is ineffectual because it cannot capture all information (i.e. color illustrations) and mistakes were made in filming that obfuscate what content there is. In his opinion this problem is compounded by the fact that newspapers were often thrown away or sold after they had been filmed. Baker makes his case in the book Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper and a The New Yorker article entitled Deadline: the author's desperate bid to save America's past.Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper (2001, Random House; / 2001, Vintage; / 2002, Vintage; )Deadline: the author's desperate bid to save America's past.

It is the largest distiller of Irish whiskey, distilling popular brands such as Jameson and Powers, in addition to premium whiskeys such as Redbreast and Midleton Very Rare. In addition to whiskey, Irish Distillers also produces a number of other spirit products such as gin and vodka. History Irish Distillers Group was formed as Irish Distillers Limited (IDL) in 1966, when a merger took place between three Irish whiskey distilleries, Cork Distilleries Company, John Jameson & Son and John Power & Son. In an attempt to reverse the decline in Irish whiskey sales, the board of directors decided to close their existing distilleries in Cork and Dublin, and to consolidate production at a new purpose-built facility. A site alongside the existing distillery in Midleton, Co. Cork was chosen as the location for the new distillery, as there was no room for expansion alongside the Dublin distilleries. In 1972, Bushmills, the only other whiskey distillery in operation in Ireland at the time, joined the group, giving Irish Distillers complete control over all whiskey production on the island of Ireland. One Friday in July 1975, production ceased at the Old Midleton Distillery and began the next Monday morning at the new Midleton complex, with distillation at the two Dublin distilleries come to an end a year later. The distillery at Bushmills, County Antrim remained in operation. The Old Midleton Distillery and Jameson's Bow Street Distillery have since reopened as visitors' centres. In contrast, much of Powers John's Lane distillery has been demolished, with the remaining buildings, now protected structures, forming part of the National College of Art and Design. Following a hostile takeover attempt from Grand Metropolitan, Allied-Lyons and Guinness, Irish distillers was the subject of a white knight takeover by Pernod Ricard in June 1988.

Background Katata was the second of the river gunboats built under the 1920 Fleet Building Program of the Imperial Japanese Navy for operations on the inland waterways of China.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy; page 120 Design The basic design of Katata was modeled after that of the gunboat , with the same general dimensions and layout. Katata had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 338 tons and draft of . She was propelled by two reciprocating engines with two Kampon boilers driving three shafts, producing and had a top speed of 16 knots. The ship was initially armed with two /28 cal. guns and six 7.7mm machine guns. Service record Katata was laid down on 29 April 1922 and launched 16 July 1922 at the Harima Shipyards at Aioi, Hyogo, Japan. As the design was incapable of open ocean sailing, she was then broken down into sections and shipped to the Tunghwa Shipyard in Shanghai, where she was reassembled and completed on 20 October 1923. She was assigned to patrols of the Yangtze River from Shanghai to the Three Gorges, for commerce protection and as a show of force in protection of Japanese nationals and economic interests through the rest of the 1920s and early 1930s. Katata was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Masatomi Kimura from January to September 1932. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Katata was based in Shanghai, and was used to evacuate Japanese residents from the interior of China. During the Battle of Shanghai, Katata bombarded Chinese positions at Shanghai on 13 August 1937. She also helped assist in the evacuation of 20,000 of Shanghai‚Äôs 30,000 Japanese civilian residents, and covered the landings of the Imperial Japanese Army‚Äôs 3rd Division, 8th Division and 11th Divisions north of Shanghai. Around 1940, Katata was refitted with two 3.1-in/40 cal anti-aircraft guns and five 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns. She was assigned to the First China Expeditionary Fleet in December 1941. On 22 June 1942, she participated in ‚ÄúOperation SE‚Äù and was assigned to the Tung Ting Lake task force with gunboats and . Around the end of 1943, her anti-aircraft weaponry was further upgraded with the replacement of the five Hotchkiss machine guns with six Type 96 AA guns. On 12 December 1944 USAAF aircraft bombed and damaged Katata near Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province at (she was possibly sunk and salvaged). She was towed to Shanghai and stripped of her armament in early 1945 to help bolster the land-based defenses. The hulk was bombed by USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters on 2 April 1945 and remained wrecked to the surrender of Japan. The wreck was given to the Republic of China as war reparations in 1946 and scrapped some time later. She was officially removed from the navy list on 3 May 1947.

History Sumida was the first gunboat in the Imperial Japanese Navy inventory designed specifically for inland river service. The need for such a vessel to operate on the rivers of the Asian mainland to protect Japanese commercial interests at various treaty ports had been perceived even before the Boxer Rebellion. The Japanese government turned to the United Kingdom, and placed an order for such two such vessels in 1903: one the Sumida to John I. Thornycroft & Company and the other to Yarrow Shipbuilders in Scotland. Sumida, was slightly larger than Fushimi and easily distinguishable by having one smokestack to Fushimi's twin stack. Sumida was launched in June 1903, but was brought to Shanghai for final fitting out, but work was halted by official British neutrality in the Russo-Japanese War, the unfinished ship was impounded in until the end of that conflict. She was finally commissioned into the Japanese navy as a second-class gunboat on June 17, 1906. Sumida remained based at the International Settlement in Shanghai. During World War I, due to the official neutrality of the Republic of China, Sumida's weaponry was placed under lock in 1914, and was not freed until China officially joined the Allies. Sumida saw combat service in the Second Sino- Japanese War, beginning with the First Shanghai Incident in 1931. Sumida continued to operate on the Yangtze River in China during the early 1930s, but was already considered obsolete, and was struck from the navy list on March 1, 1935. She was scrapped on March 31, 1935 at Shanghai.

He was one of the discoverers of the J/œà meson which confirmed the existence of the charm quark. He worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with the Supernova Cosmology Project, and was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley as well as a professor at Berkeley's graduate school in astrophysics. Biography Goldhaber was born on February 20, 1924 in Germany. His Jewish family fled Nazi Germany to Egypt and Goldhaber earned a master's degree in physics in 1947 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Goldhaber was awarded his Ph.D. in 1950 from the University of Wisconsin and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1953 while he was on the faculty of Columbia University.Hofffman, Jascha. \\"Gerson Goldhaber, Particle Physicist, Is Dead at 86\\", The New York Times, July 25, 2010. Accessed July 26, 2010. Goldhaber became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and did additional work at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. At Berkeley, Goldhaber was part of a particle physics research team that used photographic emulsion to track the movements of subatomic particles in proton-proton scattering experiments that led to the identification of the antiproton, a discovery that earned Owen Chamberlain and Emilio G. Segr√® the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959. From 1960-61 Goldhaber was a Ford Foundation fellow at CERN, Geneva. During this period he co-authored with his wife and B. Peters a CERN report.Separation of high-energy particles by means of strong interaction processes, CERN-61-03 A particle he discovered in 1963 was given the name A meson, named after his son Amos. In 1974, Goldhaber was part of a team at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center led by Burton Richter that co-discovered the J/œà meson, a flavor-neutral meson consisting of a charm quark and a charm antiquark. Richter was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1976 for his research, together with Samuel C. C. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who found the particle as part of his own research. For his work on the project, Goldhaber won the American Physical Society's Panofsky Prize and was named California Scientist of the Year. He later became involved with Rich Muller, Carl Pennypacker and Saul Perlmutter, of the Supernova Cosmology Project. The project, founded in 1988 at Lawrence Berkeley, searched the Universe for signs of supernovae, which could be used to determine the rate at which the Universe was expanding. By 1997, data that the group had gathered provided evidence that the rate of the expansion of the Universe was increasing due to what they termed dark energy, contrary to the prevailing theory that expansion would slow down and ultimately reverse itself with a Big Crunch as the ultimate fate of the universe. Goldhaber was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Together with Robert N. Cahn, Goldhaber co-wrote the text The Experimental Foundations of Particle Physics. A resident of Berkeley, California, Goldhaber died at his home there at age 86 on July 19, 2010. He was survived by his second wife, science writer Judith Margoshes, as well as two daughters, a son and three grandchildren. During their 41-year marriage, he collaborated with Judith on two books of sonnets, which were illustrated with watercolors he had painted. His marriage to nuclear chemist Sulamith Goldhaber ended with her death from a brain tumor in 1965 while the couple was traveling in India. Goldhaber's brother Maurice was a particle physicist who served as director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, one of many physicists in Goldhaber's family.

Belying its title, this work is written in the somber key of B minor, the same key as the Symphony No. 6 Path√©tique. The Pezzo is not capricious in a lighthearted sense. The capriccioso aspect comes from Tchaikovsky's fanciful treatment of various aspects of the work's simple theme. Despite some rapid passages and a turn to the major key, Tchaikovsky preserves the basic pulse and sober mood throughout the piece. Tchaikovsky (right) with Anatoliy Brandukov, to whom he dedicated the Pezzo capriccioso The sobriety was a result of Tchaikovsky's sufferings with his friend Nikolay Kondratyev. Kondratyev was in the final throes of syphilis. After a brief remission, he had been taken to Aachen, Germany, where his family hoped the mineral waters there would prolong his life at least a few months. Instead, Kondratyev had taken a turn for the worse. Moreover, he proved a highly unpredictable, volatile and demanding patient, which unnerved the already death-shy Tchaikovsky. A visit to see friends in Paris‚Äîamong them cellist Anatoliy Brandukov‚Äîproved only a brief respite. All this suffering poured through the music Tchaikovsky was writing, as well. Tchaikovsky wrote Brandukov on August 25, \\"I have written a small cello piece, and would like you to look through it, and put the final touches to the cello part.\\" Two days later he had begun to make the piano score of the piece, and on 31st he began orchestrating it. The first performance of the Pezzo capriccioso, in its arrangement for piano accompaniment, took place on at the home of M. P. Benardaky, during Tchaikovsky's visit to Paris. Brandukov was soloist, with the composer at the keyboard. The first performance of the orchestral version was given by Brandukov in Moscow at a special concert of the Russian Musical Society on November 25, 1889. Tchaikovsky conducted the orchestra. P. Jurgenson published the Pezzo capriccioso in 1888‚Äîthe orchestral parts in January, and the arrangement for cello with piano in March. Publication of the full score was delayed because Tchaikovsky had taken the manuscript abroad with him, and did not return it to Jurgenson until May 6, 1888. The full score was printed in July the same year. Further reading * ed. Abraham, Gerald, Music of Tchaikovsky (New York: W.W.

Rielo founded a school of metaphysical thought called the Genetic metaphysics of Fernando Rielo and a foundation called the Fernando Rielo Foundation.Marie-Lise Gazarian: Fernando Rielo: A Dialogue with Three Voices, page 73. Fernando Rielo Foundation Press, 2000. The foundation awards the Fernando Rielo World Prize for Mystical Poetry annually. The religious congregation founded by Rielo is called the Idente Missionaries of Christ the Redeemer. The Idente Missionaries were founded in 1959 on the island of Tenerife, Spain. Fernando is an author of many books and works, mostly in Spanish and being translated into other languages, including English.  Early years  Fernando Rielo was born on 28 August 1923 in Madrid, to his father, Enrique and his mother, Pilar Pardal. He was keenly interested in drawing during his childhood years. When he entered adolescence, the Spanish Civil War broke out, affecting people in many Spanish cities, including Madrid. Fernando once stood before a firing squad during the war, when he was receiving his First Holy Communion. The leader of the squad asked him to renounce his faith, but Fernando refused. However, the leader finally decided not to order his men to shoot Fernando.Marie-Lise Gazarian: Fernando Rielo: A Dialogue with Three Voices, page 48. Fernando Rielo Foundation Press, 2000.  Youth  Fernando Rielo was interested in reading philosophical works, including Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Fernando developed a keen interest in art, reading the Argentine cultural journal, Billiken. His father encouraged him to read several Oriental Classics too. During these years, he studied for the Spanish Civil Service examination and performed well in it, securing a high grade. He then found employment as an Administrator and went to Granada for work. There he met and fell in love with a young woman. Fernando's ideal was to marry and form a family. According to the upbringing of his time, he wanted to father a child. However, he renounced marriage after a vision at the foot of the Sierra Nevada.  Motus Christi  Fernando wanted to study further and wanted to apply to the Central University of Madrid (now the University of Madrid). He intended to study Philosophy and Letters and become a professor at the University. However, he went to a church and met a Redemptorist priest. He then decided to join the Redemptorist seminary of Nava Del Ray. During his priestly studies, he liked to encourage his fellow students in preparation for their future missions. He began a movement called Motus Christi (the Movement of Christ) to revive their spiritual life.  Profession  Fernando could not remain in the Redemptorist Institute. When he completed his ecclesiastical studies, a number of coinciding events occurred as a result of which he could not receive priestly ordination. Fernando had shared his work on the Christus movement with the General Superior, who was a Belgian, who was pleased with the movement. However, the General would not remain alive for long, and succumbed to cancer of the pancreas. Fernando made his public profession during this period. Fernando then consulted a highly respected professor about his situation. He told Fernando after three days of prayer to leave the congregation. He remained with the Redemptorists till 1956. During the Christmas that year, he read the text loud before several witnesses, indicating that his profession would be immutable.  Tenerife  Fernando had to finally leave the Redemptorists. he established a religious institute, which was to be a painful journey for him. Fernando, after leaving the Redemptorist house, continued with his professional life. He was sent to the island of Tenerife, in the Canary islands to work actively as a Government employee. He arrived in Tenerife on 6 January 1957. After two years, and much pain and hard work, Fernando founded the Institute. On 29 June 1959, the official statutes were presented to Most Rev. Domingo P√©rez C√°ceres, the Bishop of the Diocese.

The film was produced by Alejandro Agresti and Axel Harding, and co-produced by Emjay Rechsteiner. The picture deals with the alienation felt by the children who survived the Argentine military dictatorship of the 1970s. Plot Opening Title Graphic: As the film begins a message appears and reminds the audience that approximately 30,000 people died during the Dirty War due to the military dictatorship's reign during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The story is then dedicated to the surviving children of the dictatorship's victims. Two such children, now adults, are the main characters. One, Daniela (Vera Fogwill), now has her degree in film and is having trouble finding work. She's hired by an older couple who are living in seclusion, to film Buenos Aires for them so they can see it again. So she goes out and documents the city. But her customers are upset, as they don't remember the Buenos Aires Daniela has filmed. She then shoots a reel of tourist-type shots in hopes of pleasing the couple. The other surviving child, Dami√°n, played by Nicol√°s Pauls, works in a low-rent motel. He eventually discovers the truth about what his parents experienced during the dictatorship. The story is largely episodic, blending together more than 6 different story lines.

During the junta's rule: the parliament was suspended; unions, political parties and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the Dirty War, between 9,000 and 30,000 people who were considered left-wing \\"subversives\\" disappeared from society.The Vanished Gallery web site. Distribution Color theatrical poster. The film was first presented at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in November 1996. It opened wide in Argentina on September 18, 1997. The film was screened at various film festivals, including: the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, France; the Contemporary Latin American Film Series at UCLA, Los Angeles; the Oslo Film Festival, Norway; the Havana Film Festival, Cuba; and others. Critical reception Film critic Karen Jaehne praised the film, and wrote, \\"The film tells you enough about each character to evoke our sympathy and not enough to let us see any possible resolution of the dilemma of loneliness. It's an intelligent film that observes mannerisms and social behavior in a way that makes you nod and say, \\"Yes, that's how it is.\\" It builds toward a very powerful ending that reminds us of many another urban disaster story, but the problem that has made Buenos Aires a metropolitan orphanage is undeniable. Buenos Aires - Vice Versa is a wise film - worth watching and will undoubtedly make it to a festival near you.\\"Jaehne, Karen . Film Scouts, film review, May 17, 1996.

He started his artistic career with a solo exhibition at the young age of 13 in 1967. Despite having no formal training in art, Mehrotra managed a parallel career of business and painting up until 1983, when he embraced painting as his solitary profession. Having been a part of the art world for over 4 decades, Mehrotra has worked with a profusion of mediums. His works steer away from conforming to the orthodox approaches. His inventive works are both rich in visual portrayal and intense in intellectual ideology, sometimes including socio-political commentary. He has served as a judge, panelist, jury member on various awards, competitions and various art events. He has also had work sold at various auctions over the years, including Bonhams, Osian's and Saffronart.  Early life and education  Mehrotra was born in Mumbai, India. He did his early schooling at St. Mary's, Mumbai and then at Mayo College, Ajmer after which he pursued business studies from the University of Mumbai.  Works  Pioneer of the digital medium as an art form in India, Mehrotra has continually pushed the conceptual thresholds of his visual language to integrate different elements in his works ‚Äì the historical with the contemporary, the traditional with the modern. The creative quest of not confining to parameters, has driven him to experiment with different mediums and subjects, both within and without the two dimensional. This foray has led him to work with oils, acrylics, fabric, resin, the digital domain of installations, web based art, Gicl√©e, audio-visual depiction and short films.

Weston State Hospital got its name in 1913 which was used while patients occupied it, but was changed back to its originally commissioned, unused name, the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, after being reopened as a tourist attraction. Designed by Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles by Baltimore architect Richard Snowden Andrews, it was constructed from 1858‚Äì1881. Originally designed to hold 250 people, it became overcrowded in the 1950s with 2,400 patients. It was forcibly closed in 1994 due to changes in patient treatment. The hospital was bought by Joe Jordan in 2007, and is opened for tours and other events to raise money for its restoration. The hospital's main building is claimed to be one of the largest hand-cut stone masonry buildings in the United States, and the second largest hand-cut sandstone building in the world, with the only bigger one being in the Moscow Kremlin. As Weston Hospital Main Building, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. History=19th century The hospital was authorized by the Virginia General Assembly in the early 1850s as the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. Following consultations with Thomas Story Kirkbride, then- superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, a building in the Kirkbride Plan was designed in the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles by Richard Snowden Andrews (1830‚Äì1903), an architect from Baltimore whose other commissions included the Maryland Governor's residence in Annapolis and the south wing of the U.S. Treasury building in Washington. Construction on the site, along the West Fork River opposite downtown Weston, began in late 1858. Work was initially conducted by prison laborers; a local newspaper in November of that year noted \\"seven convict negroes\\" as the first arrivals for work on the project. Skilled stonemasons were later brought in from Germany and Ireland. Construction was interrupted by the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Following its secession from the United States, the government of Virginia demanded the return of the hospital's unused construction funds for its defense. Before this could occur, the 7th Ohio Volunteer Infantry seized the money from a local bank, delivering it to Wheeling. It was put towards the establishment of the Reorganized Government of Virginia, which sided with the northern states during the war. The Reorganized Government appropriated money to resume construction in 1862. Following the admission of West Virginia as a U.S. state in 1863, the hospital was renamed the West Virginia Hospital for the Insane. The first patients were admitted in October 1864, but construction continued into 1881. The 200-foot (61 m) central clock tower was completed in 1871, and separate rooms for black people were completed in 1873. The hospital was intended to be self-sufficient, and a farm, dairy, waterworks, and cemetery were located on its grounds, which ultimately reached in area. 20th century A gas well was drilled on the hospital grounds in 1902. Its name was again changed to Weston State Hospital in 1913. Originally designed to house 250 patients in solitude, the hospital held 717 patients by 1880; 1,661 in 1938; over 1,800 in 1949; at its peak, 2,600 in the 1950s in overcrowded conditions. A 1938 report by a survey committee organized by a group of North American medical organizations found that the hospital housed \\"epileptics, alcoholics, drug addicts and non-educable mental defectives\\" among its population. A series of reports by The Charleston Gazette in 1949 found poor sanitation and insufficient furniture, lighting, and heating in much of the complex, while one wing, which had been rebuilt using Works Progress Administration funds following a 1935 fire started by a patient, was comparatively luxurious. Weston State Hospital found itself to be the home for the West Virginia Lobotomy Project in the early 1950s. This was an effort by the state of West Virginia and Walter Freeman to use lobotomy to reduce the number of patients in asylums because there was severe overcrowding. By the 1980s, the hospital had a reduced population due to changes in the treatment of mental illness. Those patients who could not be controlled were often locked in cages. In February 1986, then-Governor Arch Moore announced plans to build a new psychiatric facility elsewhere in the state and convert the Weston hospital to a prison. Ultimately the new facility, the William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital, was built in Weston and the old Weston State Hospital was simply closed in May 1994. The building and its grounds have since been mostly vacant, aside from local events such as fairs, church revivals, and tours. In 1999, all four floors of the interior of the building were damaged by several city and county police officers playing paintball, three of whom were dismissed over the incident. Efforts towards adaptive reuse of the building have included proposals to convert the building into a Civil War Museum and a hotel and golf course complex. A non-profit 501(c)3 organization, the Weston Hospital Revitalization Committee, was formed in 2000 for the purpose of aiding the preservation of the building and finding appropriate tenants. 21st century Three small museums devoted to military history, toys, and mental health were opened on the first floor of the main hospital building in 2004, but were soon forced to close due to fire code violations. The hospital was auctioned by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources on August 29, 2007. Joe Jordan, an asbestos demolition contractor from Morgantown, was the high bidder and paid $1.5 million for the building. Bidding started at $500,000. Joe Jordan has also begun maintenance projects on the former hospital grounds. In October 2007, a Fall Fest was held at the Weston State Hospital. Guided historic and paranormal daytime tours were offered as well as evening ghost hunts and paranormal tours. The main building of the asylum, known as the Kirkbride, holds several rooms that serve as the museum, located on the first floor. There are paintings, poems, and drawings made by patients in the art therapy programs, a room dedicated to the different medical treatments and restraints used in the past, and artifacts such as a straitjacket and hydrotherapy tub. The tour guides dress in clothes that resemble 19th century nurse outfits; blue dress, white apron, white cap, and white shoes. The shorter historical tour offer allows visitors to see the first floor of the Kirkbride, while the longer historical tour allows visitors to see all four floors, apartments of the staff, the morgue, and the operating room. Aside from the historical tours, there are also two paranormal tours. Both start as the sun sets, the shorter tour lasting around two to three hours, the longer tour being overnight with the option of having a private tour. In popular culture *The former facility was featured as a haunted location on several paranormal television shows, including Ghost Stories, Syfy's Ghost Hunters, Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures, and Paranormal Lockdown on Destination America/TLC as well as Portals To Hell *The facility is featured in Bethesda Game Studios' 2018 video game Fallout 76, under the name ‚ÄúFort Defiance‚Äù, acting as a base for The Brotherhood of Steel, one of the game's main factions. *The facility is featured in episode 60 of the podcast Lore.

The thought experiment A hypothetical being, which Nozick calls the utility monster, receives much more utility from each unit of a resource they consume than anyone else does. For instance, eating a cookie might bring only one unit of pleasure to an ordinary person but could bring 100 units of pleasure to a utility monster. If the utility monster can get so much pleasure from each unit of resources, it follows from utilitarianism that the distribution of resources should acknowledge this. If the utility monster existed, it would justify the mistreatment and perhaps annihilation of everyone else, according to the mandates of utilitarianism, because, for the utility monster, the pleasure they receive outweighs the suffering they may cause. Nozick writes: > Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who > get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than > these others lose ... the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed > in the monster's maw, in order to increase total utility. This thought experiment attempts to show that utilitarianism is not actually egalitarian, even though it appears to be at first glance. The experiment contends that there is no way of aggregating utility which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a utility monster, because it's possible to tailor a monster to any given system. For example, Rawls' maximin considers a group's utility to be the same as the utility of the member who's worst off. The \\"happy\\" utility monster of total utilitarianism is ineffective against maximin, because as soon as a monster has received enough utility to no longer be the worst-off in the group, there's no need to accommodate it. But maximin has its own monster: an unhappy (worst-off) being who only gains a tiny amount of utility no matter how many resources are given to it. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to utility monsters.  History  Robert Nozick, a twentieth century American philosopher, coined the term \\"utility monster\\" in response to Jeremy Bentham's philosophy of utilitarianism. Nozick proposed that accepting the theory of utilitarianism causes the necessary acceptance of the condition that some people would use this to justify exploitation of others. An individual (or specific group) would claim their entitlement to more \\"happy units\\" than they claim others deserve, and the others would consequently be left to receive fewer \\"happy units\\". Nozick deems these exploiters \\"utility monsters\\" (and for ease of understanding, they might also be thought of as happiness hogs). Nozick poses utility monsters justify their greediness with the notion that, compared to others, they experience greater inequality or sadness in the world, and deserve more happy units to bridge this gap. People not part of the utility monster group (or not the utility monster individual themselves) are left with less happy units to be split among the members. Utility monsters state that the others are happier in the world to begin with, so they would not need those extra happy units to which they lay claim anyway. Social implications=Free speech The utility monster has been invoked in debates about free speech. Advocates for laws against hate speech, flag- burning, and blasphemy have been accused of becoming utility monsters in order to increase society's willingness to support their policies. Population The utility monster has been invoked in debates about population. Derek Parfit's mere addition paradox suggests that additional humans would add to total happiness, even if expanding population decreases average happiness. Opposite reasoning yields the \\"repugnant conclusion\\" that the world would be better off with one extremely happy person. Parfit suggests that Nozick's utility monster is misleading because it appeals to our intuitions about a being which experiences more than a million times the utility of a very well- off ordinary person, which is, he thinks, inconceivable.Derek Parfit, \\"Overpopulation and the quality of life\\", in The Repugnant Conclusion, J. Ryberg and T. T√§nnsj√∂, eds., 2004. The implication is a more common-sense continuous scale of happiness change, from great to nil, based on scarcity of units, the happiness increasing from an additional unit of resource only inversely proportional to the existing pool of units.  Relevance  The reason this can come to be, and the reason the utility monster is a condition of utilitarianism in effect, is because the philosophy necessarily begs the question of how to measure happiness. A person can be in much grief, but there is no physical way to measure the lack of happiness they experience, and whether this is greater or less than a person who is enduring a different pain, like physical torture. Rephrased, this brings to light the question of which person is more deserving and which person is less deserving of happiness units based on life experiences. Individuals must take other's word regarding how much happiness they each possess, and the happiness they should therefore be able to lay claim. It is a common idea that hurt individuals deserve compensation for their pain. Yet Nozick's utility monster would take advantage of this reward process, by proclaiming their pain is the greatest and most deserving of reward.

At the time, he was in the process of divorcing his Jewish wife, Hettie Jones, and embracing Black Nationalism. Dutchman may be described as a political allegory depicting black and white relations during the time Baraka wrote it.Davidson, Jiton Sharmayne, \\"Sometimes funny, but most times deadly serious: Amiri Baraka as political satirist\\", African American Review, 37.2-3, Gale Group, Summer-Fall 2003, accessed April 19, 2011.

Plot The action focuses almost exclusively on Lula, a white woman, and Clay, a black man, who both ride the subway in New York City. Clay's name is symbolic of the malleability of black identity and black manhood. It is also symbolic of integrationist and assimilationist ideologies within the contemporary Civil Rights Movement.Rebhorn, Matthew. \\"Flaying Dutchman: Masochism, Minstrelsy, and the Gender Politics of Amiri Baraka's Dutchman\\", Callaloo 26.3, Gale Group, Summer 2003, accessed April 19, 2011. Lula boards the train eating an apple, an allusion to the Biblical Eve. The characters engage in a long, flirtatious conversation throughout the train ride. Lula sits down next to Clay. She accuses him of staring at her buttocks. She ignores his denials and uses stereotypes to correctly guess where he lives, where he is going, what Clay's friend, Warren, looks and talks like. Lula guesses that Clay tried to get his own sister to have sex with him when he was 10. Clay is shocked by her apparent knowledge of his past and says that she must be a friend of Warren. Lula is glad that Clay is so easy to manipulate and puts her hand on his leg. She feeds him apples. She tells Clay to invite her out to the party he is going to. At this point, it is unclear whether Clay is really going to a party, but he tells her he really is. Lula vaguely alludes to having sex with Clay at her \\"apartment\\" after the \\"party\\". We don't know if these are real or conveniently made-up by Lula. Clay is gladdened by Lula's apparent liking for him and maintains a hopeful attitude to having sex together. However, he does not push his hope onto her and waits for Lula to make the offer first. Lula is angered by Clay's not falling for her manipulative tactics. She switches strategies and mocks Clay's Anglo- American speech, his college education and his three-button suit. She derides his being black and passive. She dances mockingly in an R&B; style and tells Clay to join her and \\"do the nasty. Rub bellies\\". Clay, who does not respond initially, eventually grabs her and throws her down. Clay accuses Lula of knowing nothing but \\"luxury\\". He slaps her twice and tells her to leave him alone. Clay launches into a monologue. Clay suggests that whites let black people dance \\"black\\" dances and make \\"black\\" music. He explains that these segregatory actions assuage black Americans' anger towards whites and distracts them from accessing the \\"white man's intellectual legacy\\". Clay states that if black people stopped trying to heal their pain through dance, music, civic participation, religion, or focusing on moving upwards in American society, and became coldly rational like white people, black people would just kill all the whites and be done with racism in America. Clay says that if he were to take Lula's words to heart, he should just kill all the white people he meets. Although Clay says all this, he deeply rejects this plan of action. He states that he does not want to kill and that he prefers to be ignorant of the problem. He says he would rather choose to pretend to be ignorant of racism, not try to get rid of it by fighting with whites. Once Clay makes his confession, Lula changes strategies again. Clay makes as if to leave, but Lula coolly, rationally, stabs him twice to the heart. She directs all the other passengers, blacks and whites, in the train car to throw his body out and get out at the next stop. The play ends with Lula looking towards another young black man who has just boarded the now mostly empty train car. The elderly black train conductor steps into the compartment and tips Lula his hat.  Symbolism  The play's title evokes images of Dutch ships that carried slaves across the Atlantic. The subway car itself, endlessly traveling the same course, is symbolic of ‚ÄúThe Course of History.‚Äù Another layer of the title‚Äôs symbolism is the myth of the Flying Dutchman, a ghost ship which, much like the subway car Clay rides on, endlessly sails on with a crew that is unable to escape the confines of the vessel. Characters # Clay: is a 20-year-old, middle-class black man. He is college educated, and well dressed. Clay is extremely calm and well-mannered, although he finally reaches is breaking point by the end of the play. It is thought that Clay‚Äôs character is both real and symbolic. Symbolizing the real struggle of a black man. # # Lula: is a 30-year-old white woman. She is tall, slender, and has long red hair. She is described in the play as loud lipstick, bright, and skimpy summer clothes, with sandals, and sunglasses. Like Clay, Lula is also symbolic, she symbolizes \\"White America\\". Throughout the play, Lula continues to seduce and taunt Clay. # # Riders of Coach: are white and black. Although they do not play an important role until the end of the play, they are witnesses to Clay's rant, and his murder. # # Young Negro: is about 20 years old. He is described to have a couple of books under his arm. It is suggested at the end of the play that he is Lula‚Äôs next victim. # # Conductor: is portrayed as a happy spirited man, mumbling a song to himself, and swaying down the aisle to a song in his head. He does not appear until the end of play.

The bird originated in Kentucky and Pennsylvania in the late 19th century, and was created by crossing Buff, Standard Bronze, and White Holland turkeys. It was first recognized as a turkey variety by the American Poultry Association in 1909. Bourbon Reds were selectively bred for utility traits as a meat bird, and was an important variety in the turkey industry throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Like most turkey breeds, it declined after the commercial adoption of the Broad Breasted White.

Instead, glutaredoxins are reduced by the oxidation of glutathione. Oxidized glutathione is then regenerated by glutathione reductase. Together these components compose the glutathione system. Like thioredoxin, which functions in a similar way, glutaredoxin possesses an active centre disulfide bond. It exists in either a reduced or an oxidized form where the two cysteine residues are linked in an intramolecular disulfide bond. Glutaredoxins function as electron carriers in the glutathione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Moreover, GRX act in antioxidant defense by reducing dehydroascorbate, peroxiredoxins, and methionine sulfoxide reductase. Beside their function in antioxidant defense, bacterial and plant GRX were shown to bind iron-sulfur clusters and to deliver the cluster to enzymes on demand.  In viruses  Glutaredoxin has been sequenced in a variety of viruses. On the basis of extensive sequence similarity, it has been proposed that Vaccinia virus protein O2L is, it seems, a glutaredoxin. Bacteriophage T4 thioredoxin seems to be evolution-related. In position 5 of the pattern T4, thioredoxin has Val instead of Pro.  In plants  Approximately 30 GRX isoforms are described in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and 48 in Oryza sativa L. According to their redox-active centre, they are subgrouped in six classes of the CSY[C/S]-, CGFS-, CC-type and 3 groups with additional domain of unknown function. The CC-type GRXs are only found in higher plants. In Arabidopsis GRXs are involved in flower development and Salicylic acid signalling.

It was founded in 1874 as the San Diego Society of Natural History. It is the second oldest scientific institution west of the Mississippi and the oldest in Southern California. The present location of the museum was dedicated on January 14, 1933. A major addition to the museum was dedicated in April 2001, doubling exhibit space. History Allosaurus at the San Diego Natural History Museum The San Diego Natural History Museum grew out of the San Diego Society of Natural History, which was founded on October 9, 1874. The Natural History Society was founded by George W. Barnes, Daniel Cleveland, Charles Coleman, E. W. Hendrick and O. N. Sanford. It is the oldest scientific institution in southern California, and the second oldest west of the Mississippi. In its initial years, the San Diego Society of Natural History was the region's primary source of scientific culture, serving a small but growing community eager for information about its natural resources. Early society members established a Volunteer County Weather Service in 1875, petitioned to create Torrey Pines State Reserve in 1885 and Anza Borrego Desert State Park, and garnered support for the San Diego Zoological Society. In 1887, the Society was given a lot on Sixth Avenue between B and C streets by E. W. Morse, a former president of the city's short-lived Lyceum of Natural Sciences. The Hotel Cecil was eventually built on part of the society's lot, and in June 1912 the Society began to meet there. In 1910, the San Diego Society of Natural History hired Kate Stephens, an authority on terrestrial and marine mollusks, as curator for its collections. These included the personal collection of her husband, mammalogist and ornithologist Frank Stephens, who donated over 2000 bird and mammal specimens to the Society in 1910. In June 1912, Katherine and Frank Stephens installed the Society's first museum exhibits at the Hotel Cecil, where they could be viewed by the public on selected afternoons. The Sixth Avenue property hosted the museum's exhibits for a very short time, roughly 1912‚Äì1917. However, it remained the property of the Society until 1987, when it was sold to the Trammel Crow Company. Money raised by the sale became part of the Museum of Natural History's endowment fund. Exposition Buildings, Balboa Park Nevada State Building, Balboa Park Foreign and Domestic Arts Building, Balboa Park Commerce & Industries Building, Balboa Park Various supporters of the 1915 Panama-California Exposition at Balboa Park expressed interest in repurposing buildings from the Exposition. This was complicated because the actual title to the land in Balboa Park remained with the City of San Diego. In June 1916, museum supporter G. S. Thompson proposed that \\"The one legal ground that a private museum corporation has that will permit it to occupy city-owned buildings in a public park is that the museum authorities maintain exhibits that will be free, i.e., without admission charges, and open at all times to the public.\\"San Diego Union, June 20, 1916, II, 2. The museum eventually occupied three different buildings from the Exposition in Balboa Park, none of which was ideally suited to museum use. In 1917, the Society paid $500 to the Panama-California Exposition Corporation for the vacant Nevada State Building. The Society moved its growing collections and library into the building in February 1917, thus creating the San Diego Natural History Museum. Frank Stephens served as the first director of the museum from 1917 to 1920. The Board identified its mission as being \\"to educate and help people know and love nature\\". Using specimens from the museum's collections, the institution developed educational outreach programs with city and county schools. Unfortunately, many of the buildings at the Exposition had been intended as temporary structures. The two-story Nevada building, with its arcades, flanking wings, and Spanish-Renaissance trim, was not built to last. The museum obtained permission from the Park Commission to move to the 1915 Foreign Arts Building, which it remodeled in 1920. When the Foreign Arts Building proved too small, the museum expanded into the 1916 Canadian Building (previously the 1915 Commerce and Industries Building). This new space was opened to the public on December 9, 1922. The museum's intention was to eventually combine the buildings. William Templeton Johnson Building, Balboa Park From 1922 until his death in 1946, Clinton G. Abbott was the museum's director. During Abbott's period as director, the museum was able to build and move into long-term quarters. Other notable naturalists and curators of this period include Guy Fleming, Laurence M. Huey, and Laurence M. Klauber. In 1925, a nearby fire raised concerns about the safety of the existing museum buildings. Community leaders recognized the need for a permanent museum of adequate size that would be both fire-proof and earthquake-proof. Ellen Browning Scripps was a major benefactor of the proposed building project. In 1932, San Diego's leading architect, William Templeton Johnson, was commissioned by the Society of Natural History to design its new museum building on Balboa Park's East Prado. Johnson had earned his reputation with his design of the Fine Arts Gallery (now the San Diego Museum of Art) and the downtown San Diego Trust & Savings Bank, among other buildings. The museum building combined Spanish and Moorish touches. Yellow and blue tiles mark a row of arches under a balustrade; surprisingly, given the Spanish influences, the building did not have a tiled roof. The construction of the permanent headquarters was made possible through a grant of $125,000 from Ellen Browning Scripps, and by public subscription. However, the full amount needed for the building could not be raised in the Depression years. Only the first unit of the building, at the south end of the lot, and one wing extending toward the north, could be built. The north and east exterior facades were left plain as temporary walls slated for future expansion, and remained so for 60 years. The $175,000 Natural History Museum building was formally dedicated on January 14, 1933. World War II The Society was notified on March 8, 1943, that the United States Navy wished to take over the Natural History Museum for hospital use at once, becoming the infectious diseases ward. Some renovation took place in the facility, including the addition of an elevator designed to handle hospital gurneys and a nurses' station between floors. Both features remain in use today. The U.S. Navy takeover of the museum building for the duration of World War II resulted in damage to the collections, exhibits, and the building itself. The main library and its librarian were moved to San Diego State College; the rest of the treasured and fragile exhibits were hastily packed, crated and moved into a total of 32 separate places. Exhibits too large to be moved were stuffed into the north wing on the main floor. Director Clinton G. Abbott and a staff of four were allowed only limited access to an area of the basement. Once staff were allowed to reoccupy the building, on July 1, 1949, major renovations commenced. Forced to look at all collections and exhibits by this rehabilitation process, the board adopted a firm policy to restrict collections to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The museum continued its steady growth with post-war San Diego, despite periods of financial stress. The American Alliance of Museums accredited the museum in 1974. Postmodern style facade.

In 1991, Michael Hager took over the position of President and CEO of the San Diego Natural History Museum. With Robert F. Smith, he led the museum through a strategic planning process that focused the museum's collection strategies on southern and Baja California, and led to the development of the Biodiversity Research Center of Southern California, a collaborative Environmental Science Education Center for the United States and Mexico, and a major capital campaign for the expansion of the museum itself. In April 2001, new design and construction more than doubled the size of the 1933 building, from of usable space to approximately . The entrance received a new Postmodern style facade and glassed atrium. The project architects were Richard Bundy and David Thompson Architects Inc. The expansion also provided new space for the museum's research, educational, and administrative activities. ;LEED Certification In December 2009, the San Diego Natural History Museum was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design‚àíLEED for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance (LEED-EB: O&M;) Certification.Sdnhm.org: \\"Museum LEED Certification\\" (2009) It is one of the oldest privately owned institutions to achieve the award.Sdnhm.org: \\"The Oldest LEED-EB: O&M-certified; Museum in the Nation\\" Exhibitions and programs Finback Whale skull With the addition of the new wing to the museum, areas for permanent exhibitions were created, along with five new exhibition halls. Also added was the state-of-the-art Charmaine and Maurice Kaplan Theater with a 56' screen and a Dolby Digital 3D projector. The new display installations eliminated the formerly popular Old Mine mineralogy gallery, that had displayed mineral specimens, gemstones, and fluorescent rocks and minerals. Current exhibitions Kit fox habitat in Coast to Cactus installation Romeyn Beck Hough, books of American Woods from the Extraordinary Ideas installation Fossil Mysteries is a highly interactive exhibition tracing the 75-million-year fossil-rich prehistory of southern California and Baja California, Mexico. With a large display of fossils, dioramas, murals, models, and interactives, the exhibition chronicles evolution, extinction, ecology, and Earth processes from the age of the dinosaurs to the Ice Ages. The 2015 installation of Coast to Cactus in Southern California highlights the region's biodiversity. The permanent exhibition was honored by the American Alliance of Museums' \\"Overall Excellence for an Exhibition\\" recognition in June 2016. In 2016, the museum renovated space in the Research Library to create the Eleanor and Jerome Navarra Special Collections Gallery, which contains the new permanent exhibition, Extraordinary Ideas From Ordinary People: A History of Citizen Science. Extraordinary Ideas received Honorable Mention in the 2017 AAM exhibition competition. In 2017, the Museum drew on the abundance of material in its collections to create the new exhibition, Unshelved ‚Äì Cool Stuff from Storage. Specimens curated by the several departments that comprise the Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias (BRCC) contributed. Meticulously preserved and catalogued material from the research collections of Birds and Mammals, Botany, Entomology, Herpetology, Marine Invertebrates, Mineralogy, Paleontology, and the Research Library provides a \\"backstage\\" view into the Museum's remarkable holdings. Other notable exhibitions In 2003, the Museum presented a major showing of paintings from its collection in the exhibition Plant Portraits: The California Legacy of A.R. Valentien. The exhibition, created in collaboration with the Irvine Museum, displayed 80 of the museum's 1092 watercolors of California plants painted in the early 1900s by Albert R. Valentien. Winner of the 2004 Western Museums Association Excellence in Exhibition Award, the Valentien show toured museums in the United States through 2009. In 2007‚Äì2008 a collection of the Dead Sea Scrolls were on display, ten of them being shown for the first time in public. The show's attendance was close to 400,000 visitors, a record for any exhibit at the museum. Research The museum serves as the major biodiversity repository in the region, conducting field research across a range of scientific disciplines and providing an important source of flora and fauna distributional data for environmental systems protection, land use planning, environmental surveys, and development mitigation. Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias The Museum and its research unit, the Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias (BRCC), conduct biological expeditions and field research in Southern California and on the Baja California peninsula, bringing together scientists from various disciplines and fostering collaboration between participating institutions in the United States and Mexico. The expeditions also support the enhancement of the institutions' scientific collections, conservation efforts, management of natural resources, and environmental education. The BRCC was established in 2002 to focus research and collections on regional biology, biodiversity, and geology. Representative expeditions include the 2013‚Äì2016 Sierra Cacachilas biodiversity study (which resulted in the discovery of a new species of spider, Califorctenus cacachilensis), a status survey of the flora and fauna of Isla Guadalupe (2000), the Agua Verde and Punta Mechudo (2003) expedition (a binational, multidisciplinary expedition explored the southern end of the Sierra de La Giganta), and the 1997 study of the Sierra San Francisco and the Sierra Guadalupe, located in northern Baja California Sur on the eastern edge of the Vizca√≠no Desert. The San Jacinto Resurvey, conducted by the Museum in cooperation with the Universities of California, Berkeley and Riverside from 2008 to 2010, retraced the 1908 expedition of Joseph Grinnell and associates to the San Jacinto Mountains in Riverside County to make a detailed comparison of how the region's wildlife changed over the century. The Flying Squirrel Study, with support from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, James San Jacinto Mountain Reserve, UCNRS, and the Big Bear Zoo, was launched to determine the distribution and habitat use of the San Bernardino Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus californicus) and incorporates the iNaturalist platform to allow citizen scientists to upload their observations to databases used by scientists. Research Departments Current research is conducted by the Museum's departments of Birds and Mammals, Botany, Entomology, Herpetology, and Paleontology. In addition, the departments of Marine Invertebrates and Mineralogy house significant collections regularly consulted by scientists. =Birds and Mammals= Started with the collection of pioneer mammalogist Frank Stephens, acquired in 1910, the department's taxonomic coverage now includes 90% of the world's bird families and 58% of its mammal families, with the Museum's holdings extended by its status as a repository for specimens from the San Diego Zoo. Field work by the department has resulted in the publication of two major regional distribution and identification guides, The San Diego County Bird Atlas (2004), and The San Diego County Mammal Atlas (2017). Recent work includes study of environmental pressure on Southern California bird populations. =Botany= The Botany Department actively collects in San Diego County and Baja California, and its herbarium houses a research collection of 250,000 specimens of native and naturalized plants of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The collection consists primarily of vascular plants, with significant holdings of marine algae, mostly of the eastern North Pacific. The collection is particularly rich in specimens of the Crassulaceae and Cactaceae. Recent work includes research on floristic diversity in the southwestern United States and northwestern Baja California. The Botany Department provides online access to records via two portals, the Flora of Baja California and the San Diego County Plant Atlas, with most specimens georeferenced. In addition, the Botany Department has fully indexed and published online the field books of botanist Reid Moran. =Entomology= Exterior of theNat, with banner for the exhibition \\"Unshelved: Cool Stuff from Storage.\\" The collections of the Entomology Department include over 900,000 specimens. The insect collection is especially strong in Coleoptera and Lepidoptera; smaller but important holdings include Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Neuroptera. The type collection includes over 200 primary types and 500 paratypes with particular strength in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. There are also 15 holotypes of Arachnids, mostly tarantulas. The collections are regularly used by the county's departments of Agriculture and Environmental Health, the Medical Examiner's Office, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and private environmental consultants. =Herpetology= The Herpetology Department houses over 76,000 catalogued specimens, including one of the largest rattlesnake collections in the world. Both regional and worldwide species are well represented in the collection, with specimens from throughout the southwest United States, northwest Mexico, and islands globally. The department hosts the Amphibian and Reptile Atlas of Peninsular California documenting biodiversity research using both Museum collection data and field observations from citizen scientists. In addition, the department makes search of its collection available via online databases. =Marine Invertebrates= The Marine Invertebrates Department holds approximately 5 million specimens concentrated on mollusks and crustaceans of southern California, Baja California, and the eastern Pacific, with 134 primary and 700 secondary type specimens. =Mineralogy= The Mineralogy Department maintains 26,000 catalogued specimens of minerals, meteorites, and precious gems, including an extensive collection from southern California and a synoptic collection from around the world. =Paleontology= The collections of the Paleontology Department include fossil vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants primarily of Mesozoic- through Cenozoic-age sites in southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. The PaleoServices unit assists in the collection and curation of paleontological fossils from land designated for development and provides consulting services such as paleontological resource assessment of properties and paleontological mitigation plans. The department maintains an online paleontology database of more than 137,000 species lots representing 1.4 million specimens, primarily from the southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico regions. Recent work by the department has included radiometric dating of the Cerutti Mastodon site. =Research Library= Extraordinary Ideas from Ordinary People: A History of Citizen Science. San Diego Natural History Museum Research Library. Library collections include a complete natural history reference library, the rare book collection, the Klauber Herpetology Library, and the map collection. In addition, the Library's art collection includes treasures such as the botanical watercolors of A. R. Valentien and wildlife paintings by George Miksch Sutton and Allan Brooks. The Library's archives include a large collection of historical photographs and many important field notes collections, such as those of herpetologist Laurence Klauber (available online at the Internet Archive), mammalogists Frank Stephens and Laurence M. Huey (available at the Internet Archive), and naturalist Charles Russell Orcutt. The library director curates the Museum's permanent exhibition Extraordinary Ideas from Ordinary People: A History of Citizen Science, which draws from the rich resources of the library's varied collections. =San Diego Zooarchaeology Laboratory= The San Diego Zooarchaeology Laboratory (SDZL) identifies faunal assemblages from archaeological sites in San Diego County, the western United States, and the ancient Near East, referencing the San Diego Natural History Museum's scientific collections. Founded in 2010, the SDZL collections include over 46,000 bird specimens and 22,650 mammals. With 7,000 complete bird skeletons, and over 1,400 partial skeletons, the collections contain 90% of bird families worldwide, represented by 1,605 species. Over 1,000 complete mammal skeletons and 20,000 skulls are currently housed, and the collections continue to grow. In-house scholars provide expertise in the specialities of paleontology, marine invertebrates, entomology, herpetology, and botany. Providing interpretation and perspective on the use of animals in antiquity, the SDZL collects and documents zooarchaeological information (specimens and literature) for use by the scientific community, fosters cooperative research, and communicates with the public about zooarchaeological research in the region. In addition, the SDZL provides training to students and volunteers in zooarchaeological techniques and methods. Publications The Museum's refereed scientific publications date back to 1905, reflecting the long history of the San Diego Society of Natural History as a leader in research of the geologic past and present biodiversity of western North America and beyond. All of the Museum's scientific publications are available online. The journal Transactions of San Diego Society of Natural History preceded the currently published Proceedings of the San Diego Society of Natural History as the Museum's major scientific publication. In-depth volumes of Memoirs have treated topics comprehensively, while shorter works, often written for a more general non-technical audience, have been published as Occasional Papers. In addition, the Museum has published the magazines Environment Southwest and Field Notes. The Museum maintains online atlas projects including the binational Amphibian and Reptile Atlas of Peninsular California and the Plant Atlas of San Diego County. Recent publications include the Bird Atlas of San Diego County (2004), the Checklist of the Vascular Plants of San Diego County (2014, 5th ed.), and the Mammal Atlas of San Diego County (2017).

It is chemically and biologically inert and stable up to 400 ¬∞C. Several applications make use of its ability to dissolve gases. Manufacture It is manufactured by the fluorination of tetralin or decalin with cobalt(III) fluoride in the Fowler process. For most applications, several steps of purification are required after reaction. Isomers Perfluorodecalin exhibits cis-trans isomerism, as the tertiary fluorines atoms on the bridge carbon atoms can be either on the same side as each other (cis-isomer) or on opposite sides (trans-isomer). Both isomers are chemically and biologically inert and are very similar in their physical properties. The most notable difference is in the melting point, which is ‚àí3.6 ¬∞C for the cis-isomer, +18 ¬∞C for the trans-isomer, and ‚àí6.7 ¬∞C for a 50/50 mixture.\\"Flutec PP Fluorocarbon Liquids\\", ISC Chemicals Ltd, table E5-2/4 File:Cis-Perfluordecalin.svgcis File:Trans-Perfluordecalin.svgtrans Medical applications Of all the perfluorocarbons, perfluorodecalin has probably seen the most interest in medical applications. Most applications utilize its ability to dissolve large amounts of oxygen (100 mL of perfluorodecalin at 25 ¬∞C can dissolve 49 mL of oxygen at STP). Perfluorodecalin was an ingredient in Fluosol, an artificial blood product developed by Green Cross Corporation in the 1980s. It is also being studied for use in liquid breathing. Perfluorodecalin can be applied topically, to provide extra oxygen to a specific location, to accelerate wound healing. Organs and tissues can be stored for longer in oxygenated perfluorodecalin; the \\"two-layer method\\" uses perfluorodecalin and UW solution to preserve tissue for pancreas transplants.For instance, It is an ingredient of Perftoran, a blood substitute that also contains perfluoro-N-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-piperidine along with a surfactant, proxanol-268. It was developed in Russia and as of 2005 was marketed there. Other applications Due to its gas-carrying capacity, perfluorodecalin has been used to enhance oxygen delivery during cell culture. Perfluorodecalin has also been shown to dramatically enhance in vivo microscopy resolution of airspace-containing tissues such as mesophyll. Mounting leaves in perfluorodecalin significantly improves the optical qualities of the leaf, thereby enabling high-resolution imaging over twofold deeper into the mesophyll, compared with using water. The physiological impact of mounting the specimen in perfluorodecalin is also minimal compared to water. Perfluorodecalin is partially miscible with hydrocarbons which makes it an attractive inert anti-solvent for some specialized applications, such as self- organization of perovskite nanocrystals into supercrystals (also known as superlattices). This compound is sometimes used to dissolve Teflon AF (not to be confused with other Teflons, as PTFE, PFA and FEP).

He was the first Bishop of Aberdeen fully independent of the Roman Catholic Church. His predecessor, William Gordon began as a Roman Catholic bishop, but accepted the Church of Scotland's authority. Born around 1540, he graduated in the early 1560s as Master of Arts from St Leonard's College, St Andrews.At some point between 1560 and 1562 - see Riis, \\"Cunningham, David (c.1540‚Äì1600)\\". Cunningham also studied Civil Law in France, at the University of Paris and the University of Bourges.Riis, \\"Cunningham, David (c. 1540‚Äì1600)\\". He became a Protestant sometime before 1562, when he was made minister of Lanark; he held this position until 1570, when he took over Lesmahagow, moving to Cadder in 1572 and then to Lenzie in 1574. Additionally, on 22 March 1572, Cunningham became Provost of Bothwell Collegiate Church.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 346. After the appointment of Patrick Adamson as Archbishop of St Andrews in December 1576, Cunningham replaced Adamson as the chaplain of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Regent of Scotland.Riis, \\"Cunningham, David (c.1540‚Äì1600)\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 299. With access to such high level magnate patronage,Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 131. on either 5 October or 5 November 1577, Cunningham was elected as Bishop of Aberdeen, receiving consecration on 11 November.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 4. In this year, too, he became Chancellor of King's College, Aberdeen. Cunningham would eventually enjoy a good relationship with the king, but his association with Regent Morton initially made him suspect. The death of his patron, Morton, in 1581, put his position under pressure, and he was forced to flee into the west for a little time. He was also under pressure from the a large section of the Scottish church, which was becoming more hostile to episcopacy; in 1586, the General Assembly accused him of adultery, a charge which the king cleared him of in 1587. He became a trusted servant of the king, James VI of Scotland, and it was Cunningham who was chosen to baptise the king's son, Prince Henry, on 30 August 1594. Cunningham helped negotiate reconciliation between the king and the devoutly Catholic George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly, and in 1598 was sent to Denmark and Germany to promote King James' claims to the throne of the Kingdom of England. Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 131; Riis, \\"Cunningham, David (c. 1540‚Äì1600)\\". Cunningham died on 30 August 1600, at Aberdeen. Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 299; Riis, \\"Cunningham, David (c. 1540‚Äì1600)\\", gives 3 August as the date of death. He was once married, but had no children. He left assets of ¬£3052 (Scots).

It starred Warner Anderson as Guthrie and Tom Tully as Grebb. Grebb was now an inspector instead of a sergeant because at the time the series was made there was no such rank as sergeant in the Bureau of Inspectors, SFPD's investigative division, and a full inspector was the closest equivalent to the generic detective sergeant the character had been on radio. The TV version, a CBS Television production, was filmed on location, using Desilu's production facilities.

Their descendants are traditional custodians of the southern geographic areas of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Country The Gweagal lived on the area of southern side of the Georges River and Botany Bay stretching towards the Kurnell Peninsula. Although not clearly defined, their traditional lands are thought to have possibly extended over much of the Cronulla-Sutherland area as far west as Liverpool. Culture Aboriginal hunting implements and weapons The Gweagal are the traditional owners of the white clay pits in their territory, which are considered sacred. Historically clay was used to line the base of their canoes so they could light fires, and also as a white body paint, (as witnessed by Captain James Cook). Colour was added to the clay using berries, which produced a brightly coloured paint that was used in ceremonies. It was also eaten as a medicine, an antacid. Geebungs and other local berries were mixed in the clay. Aboriginal rock shelters Naturally forming and human- modified caves or hanging rock shelters were regularly utilised by the first Australians during walkabout ‚Äì seasonally guided maintenance of land and the vast natural gardens routinely tended by the Aboriginal people. In the Royal National Park some of the caves were used as burial sites. In tribal lands and Dreamtime places this cultural practice continues. Charles Sturt documented large stone dwellings consisting of four rooms or more, along the banks of the Murray River and the shores of Lake Victoria, New South Wales. These buildings were re-purposed by settlers in the early years of colonisation, and the foundations of many such buildings can be seen in archaeological sites around Australia. A rock cave collapse at Port Hacking before the landing of Cook claimed many lives of the Gweagal. This cave was later dynamited, revealing many skeletons. Caves and shelters are located in various places along the Georges River, which over the years have eroded into the sandstone cliffs. There is a large cave located in Peakhurst with its ceiling blackened from smoke. There are caves located around Evatt Park, Lugarno with oyster shells ground into the cave floor. A cave has also been discovered near a Baptist church in Lugarno, and another near Margaret Crescent, Lugarno (now destroyed by development), which was found to contain ochre and a spearhead on the floor of the cave when it was excavated. Another cave exists on Mickey's Point, Padstow, which was named after a local Gweagal man. Australia's First Nation people decorated their caves and homes with carvings, sculpture, beads, paintings, drawings and etchings using white, red and other coloured earth, clay or charcoal. Symbols such as \\"water well\\" with a red ochre hand directed newcomers to wells and water storage. Footprints on a line signalled that there were stairs or steps in the area. The dwellings boasted thermal mass unlike modern day housing, which kept an even temperature year-round. Rugs, furs and woven mats provided further warmth and comfort. Fire was used to cook, produce materials and keep their shelters warm. Food source The territory of the Gweagal had much to offer. The Georges River provided fish and oysters. Various small creeks, most of which are now covered drains, provided fresh water. Men and women fished in canoes or from the shore using barbed spears and fishing lines with hooks that were crafted from crescent- shaped pieces of shell. Waterfowl could be caught in the swamplands near Towra Point and the variety of soils supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants. Birds and their eggs, possums, wallabies and goannas were also a part of their staple diet. The abundant food source meant that these natives were less nomadic than those of Outback Australia. Middens Middens have been found all the way along tidal sections of the Georges River where shells, fish bones, and other waste products have been thrown into heaps. These, as well as environmental modifications such as dams, building foundations, large earthen excavations and wells, gives evidence of where the Gweagal established villages for long periods, and are found where oysters, fresh water, and strategic views come together. Middens have been found in Oatley, and Oatley Point was known as a feasting ground. In Lugarno a midden is still existent and may be found in Lime Kiln Bay. First contact with Europeans The Gweagal first made visual contact with Cook and other Europeans on the 29 April 1770 in the area which is now known as \\"Captain Cook's Landing Place\\", in the Kurnell area of Kamay Botany Bay National Park. It was the first attempt made, on Cook's first voyage, in the Endeavour, to make contact with the Aboriginal people of Australia. In sailing into the bay they had noted two Gweagal men posted on the rocks, brandishing spears and fighting sticks, and a group of four too intent on fishing to pay much attention to the ship's passage. Using a telescope as they lay offshore, approximately a kilometre from an encampment consisting of 6‚Äì8 gunyahs, Joseph Banks recorded observing an elderly woman come out of the bush, with at first three children in tow, then another three, and light a fire. While busying herself, she looked at the ship at anchor without showing any perplexity. She was joined by the four fishermen, who brought their catch to be cooked. After an hour and a half, Cook, Banks, Daniel Solander and Tupaia, together with 30 of the crew, made for the beach, only to be threatened by two warriors. They threw some gifts on shore, trying to get over the idea they had come to seek fresh water, but the Gweagal men reacted with hostile diffidence. Cook felt it necessary to encourage a change of attitude by shooting one of the men in the leg with light shot. Unperturbed, the wounded man retrieved a shield from a gunyah before returning. By that time the crew had already beached their boat. The sailors then proceeded to walk onto the beach and up to an encampment. Both Cook and Banks tried, with great difficulty, to make contact with the local people but without success due to the Gweagal avoiding further contact after the first encounter. They simply went about their daily affairs, seeming to ignore the strangers; they fished from canoes, cooked shellfish on the shore and walked along the beach, but at the same time, watched Cook's crew with caution. The Gweagal Spears and Shield The shield at the British Museum once thought to be the \\"Gweagal\\" shield In 1770, after returning to England from their voyage in the South Pacific, Cook and Banks brought with them a large collection of flora and fauna, along with cultural artefacts from their most recent venture. The find included a collection of roughly fifty Aboriginal spears that belonged to the Gweagal people. Banks was convinced the spears were abandoned (on the shores of Kurnell) and \\"thought it no improper measure to take with them all the lances which they could find, somewhere between 40 or 50\\". According to Peter Turbet, four of these spears still exist: two bone-tipped three-pronged spears (mooting), one bone-tipped four- pronged spear (calarr) and a shaft with a single hardwood head ‚Äì the only material reminder of this first contact. Cook gave the spears to his patron, John Montagu, First Lord of the Admiralty and Fourth Earl of Sandwich, who then gave them, to his alma mater Trinity College. Archaeologists quote them as being priceless, as the spears are among the few remaining artefacts that can be traced back to Cook's first voyage. Although the Gweagal Spears remain in the ownership of Trinity College, they are now on display at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge in England. An Aboriginal shield held by the British Museum had until 2018 been described by the Museum as most likely the bark shield dropped by an Aboriginal warrior (identified in Gweagal tradition as Cooman), who was shot in the leg by Cook's landing party on 29 April 1770. The shield was lent to the National Museum of Australia in Canberra for an exhibition called Encounters: Revealing stories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander objects from the British Museum, from November 2015 to March 2016. Rodney Kelly, sixth-generation descendant of Cooman, went to see the exhibition and immediately started a campaign for the return of the shield, along with the spears in held in Cambridge. Regarded as stolen objects of cultural significance, Kelly said that \\"the shield is the most significant and potent symbol of imperial aggression ‚Äì and subsequent Indigenous self-protection and resistance ‚Äì in existence\\". In April 2016, the British Museum offered to display the shield in Australia on a loan, but its permanent return was the only acceptable outcome for the Gweagal people. In 2016 the NSW Legislative Council and the Australian Senate passed motions supporting Kelly's claims. Kelly made several crowdfunded trips to the UK, and included a trip to Germany in 2016. On this trip, Kelly discovered that the Ethnological Museum of Berlin holds another shield also said to be connected to Cook's 1770 visit to Botany Bay. In November 2016, the British Museum began investigating the provenance of the shield held by them. They held a workshop involving various experts, including curators from both the British and Australian Museums, academics from the Royal Armouries, Cambridge and the Australian National University, and two Aboriginal representatives from La Perouse (the location of Cook's landing site). The participants examined the species of wood, other shields held by the British Museum, museum records and catalogue, and old colonial shipping records. The results of the workshop were reported by Maria Nugent and Gaye Sculthorpe, an Aboriginal curator at the museum, and published in Australian Historical Studies in 2018. The study discussed the origin of the shield, concluding that its history may never be completely settled. Nicholas Thomas, director and curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, in his article in the same issue of AHS, also examined the provenance of the shield, concluding that it is not the shield taken from Botany Bay in April 1770. Historian and archivist Mike Jones of the eScholarship Research Centre of the University of Melbourne and ANU School of History, while not disputing the outcome of the workshop or Thomas' claim, has challenged the use of purely European sources and perspectives to provide the provenance Indigenous artefacts, saying that the shield has become a \\"cultural touchstone\\". Sarah Keenan, Leverhulme Fellow and senior lecturer at Birkbeck College Law School in London, said that Indigenous perspectives and methodologies were not used in the workshop, and a different conclusion may have been reached, or other knowledge gained about its significance, had such methods been applied. Thomas himself said that the fact that the shield is not the one represented in the story of the Gweagal Shield does not mean that it should not be repatriated, and its symbolism to all Indigenous Australians should not lose its power. The discussion around the shield is part of a growing movement for the decolonisation of museums in the UK and around the world.

History Chambers Street is named for attorney John Chambers (1710‚Äì1764), an important parishioner at Trinity Church in Manhattan, where he was vestryman (1726‚Äì1757) and warden (1757‚Äì1765) of the church for 38 years, son of William Chambers, and husband of Anna Van Cortlandt. Chambers's nephew was John Jay. John Murray, Chambers' law partner, has nearby Murray Street named after him. Before 1971, Chambers Street continued east of Centre Street as a street called New Chambers Street, which ran through the Municipal Building's archway. In its final configuration, New Chambers Street carried traffic westbound from the intersection of Park Row, the Brooklyn Bridge off-ramp, and Duane Street. In 1971, the street was closed to make way for the construction of the pedestrian plaza at 1 Police Plaza. Duane Street was also closed and the intersection with Park Row was eliminated, with Park Row rerouted underneath the pedestrian plaza. Beginning in 2010, Chambers Street was fully reconstructed.Lower Manhattan : Chambers Street Reconstruction The rebuilding was finished in 2015.

Early life Cockburn-Campbell was born in Exeter, the second son of Sir Alexander Thomas Cockburn-Campbell, second Baronet, and his wife, Grace, daughter of Joseph Spence. He was educated in England and at Heidelberg and travelled in Europe. Cockburn-Campbell left England for Queensland, Australia in 1864 where he worked with Augustus Gregory as a chainman and later with other surveyors. In the late 1860s he went to Western Australia and took up farming; his father was resident magistrate at Albany, Western Australia. In 1871 he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his elder brother Alexander Cockburn-Campbell. Political career In 1873 Cockburn-Campbell was nominated a member of the old Western Australian Legislative Council and became chairman of committees. He was for some time editor of the West Australian but retired in 1887 due to ill health and was succeeded by John Winthrop Hackett. In 1890 he was appointed one of the delegates sent to London to give information and assistance in connexion with the passing of the Western Australian constitution bill. He also gave evidence before the Colonization Committee of the House of Commons. In December 1890 Campbell became a member of the new Legislative Council and was elected its first president. He died at Perth on 27 September 1892. He married in 1870 Lucy Anne, daughter of Arthur Trimmer, who survived him with two sons and four daughters. In 1882, Ferdinand von Mueller named Prostanthera campbellii in his honour.

Chantry Island is a small island in Lake Huron, south of the mouth of the Saugeen River and approximately a kilometre off the shores of the town of Southampton, Ontario and south of the mouth of the Saugeen River on Lake Huron. It is approximately 19 hectares (47 acres) in size and is a migratory bird sanctuary. Since the sanctuary territory extends 183 metres into the water surrounding the island, the total official area is listed as 63 hectares (160 acres). British naval officer and surveyor Henry Wolsey Bayfield named the island in 1822 after the British sculptor Francis Leggatt Chantrey. The island was designated as one of the Canadian Wildlife Service's migratory bird sanctuaries in 1957 because it is an important migratory stop for birds traveling to northern nesting sites. At certain times of year, it is home for many mating birds including, double crested cormorant, seagulls, herring gull, ring billed gull, black-crowned night herons, great blue herons and great egrets. Fisheries and Oceans Canada owns the island (and some of the surrounding water) and leases it to the Municipality of Saugeen Shores, Ontario. The Ontario region of the Canadian Wildlife Service manages the sanctuary. The island is the location of one of the six Imperial Towers, the Chantry Island Lighthouse, which was constructed in 1859; the keeper's dwelling was built at the same time. Fully restored, both are listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. Because the island is a bird sanctuary, only a single company, the Marine Heritage Society, has a permit to take visitors for a tour of the lightstation, several times a week from late May to mid-September; the rest of the island is off limits to such visitors.

Anne Chr√©tien Louis de Hell, (25 August 1783 - 1864), was a French admiral and the governor from May 1838 to October 1841Database Entry: R√©union (from the worldstatesmen.org website) of the Isle de Bourbon in the Indian Ocean ‚Äì now known as the French overseas department of R√©union.Anne Chr√©tien Louis de Hell (in French, due to the scarcity of detailed English sources) History=Early career Born in Verneuil-sur- Seine, as a promising young nobleman, he received his first military commission as a sub-lieutenant at the age of six (not totally unheard of at the time) and was sent by his family to a friend at Brest during the upheavals of the French Revolution. There, it was considered that it would be safest ‚Äì and best for his education as a young officer ‚Äì to send him on a warship. In this position as a junior officer, he apparently conducted himself well, and historians of the time as well as family documents praise his skill, intelligence and charisma. After rising up to rear admiral rank during the wars of the First Empire, he became commander of the √âcole Navale (naval academy) at Brest (a mostly administrative post, as all actual training occurred at sea), before being named governor of the Isle de Bourbon. Isle de Bourbon During his short tenure on Reunion, one of his main challenges was to smooth the difficulties associated with the slave emancipation pushed forward by the French homeland. As a slave-based plantation-society, there was considerable resistance from the local landholder class, though de Hell apparently enjoyed some success in his transition work. At the time of his departure, he had the admiration of much of the local populace, a favor he apparently returned. He is known to have been especially impressed with the Cirque de Salazie. The Reunion village of Hell-Bourg is named after him, as is Hell-Ville on Nosy-Be, Madagaskar (there is also a gastropod named after him, Strombus hellii, discovered by Kiener in 1843).Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names - H (from the Tj√§rn√∂ Marine Biological Laboratory website) Return to France Returning to France, he received the post of the Pr√©fet Maritime de Cherbourg. Later on, he was elected the Strasbourg member of the Chambre des d√©put√©s and finally Pr√©sident du conseil g√©n√©ral (roughly analogous to provincial governor) of Bas-Rhin. In 1847, he was named to lead the Direction g√©n√©rale des cartes et plans de la marine (naval cartography office). He died in 1864 at the age of 81 at his ancestral castle near Oberkirch, and even though over 20 years had gone by since his governorship, R√©union records note that a large number of locals turned out to mourn him.

The NECC was established in January 2006. NECC is a subordinate command of the Navy's Fleet Forces Command. NECC components offer functions such as command and control of expeditionary warfare operations, training, maritime and port security, logistics support, construction, littoral and coastal warfare and patrol, coastal riverine warfare, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), expeditionary diving and combat salvage, and combat photography.  Purpose  NECC aligns disparate expeditionary capabilities to coordinate expeditionary practices, procedures and requirements in the joint battlespace. NECC integrates all warfighting requirements for expeditionary combat and combat support elements, consolidating and realigning the Navy's expeditionary forces under a single command to improve fleet readiness. NECC's goal is to improve efficiencies and effectiveness through economies of scale. NECC changed how the U.S. Navy organizes, trains and equips its forces to meet the Maritime Security Operations and Joint contingency operations requirements. NECC is not a stand- alone or combat force, but rather a protection force that fills the gaps in the joint warfare arena and complements capabilities of foreign military partners. As an asset to operational commanders, NECC is designed to provide an array of capabilities that are unique to the expeditionary maritime environment as opposed to the blue water and land warfare environments. NECC seamlessly operates with the other services and coalition partners to provide cooperative assistance as requested. This redistribution of support places naval forces where they are needed the most and establishes new capabilities in support of Maritime Security Operations.  Individual training and qualifications  Members of most NECC Commands are generally expected to seek qualification for the Enlisted Expeditionary Warfare Specialist Insignia. Unless they belong to specialized communities and training which require them to qualify for their respective badge such as Seabee Combat Warfare Badge, Navy Diving Badge or Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Badge.  Component commands of the NECC  Sailors of US Navy Riverine Squadron 2 patrol waters near Haditha Dam, Anbar Province, Iraq The NECC's component commands included in January 2007: * Naval Construction Forces (NCF) or \\"Seabees\\" * Expeditionary Combat Readiness Center (ECRC) * Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group (EOD) * Expeditionary Combat Camera, Norfolk (COMCAM) * Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC) * Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group * Coastal Riverine Force (CORIVFOR) * Mobile Diving and Salvage Units * Expeditionary Warfighting Development Center (EXWDC) On the 2007 \\"Navy Times\\" list of component commands was Maritime Civil Affairs. In May 2014 the Navy disestablished its only civil affairs formation, the Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command (MCAST). McFate, writing in 2020, argued that the disestablishment of MCAST illustrated the Navy's relative prioritisation of partnerships and partnership building as opposed to combat capability.Montgomery McFate, \\"Being there: US Navy organisation culture and the forward presence debate,\\" Defence and Security Analysis, Vol. 36, No. 1, 55.

In doing so he tapped directly into a rich vein. The next year, in 1892, Stratton also hit gold in the Washington mine. Stratton became the Cripple Creek District's first millionaire.All That Glitters--Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 43 When Cripple Creek miners went on strike in 1894, Stratton's Independence mine and the Portland mine came to an agreement with them, against the wishes of other mine owners.Jameson, p. 55 Stratton had incorporated the Portland company and was its first president and largest stockholder.Jameson, p. 44 Stratton developed a theory that the gold veins in the Cripple Creek District converged at a great depth, roughly in the shape of a goblet. This theory did not pan out, however.Jameson, p. 66 The mining companies became concerned about ore theft, and in 1897 they began hiring the services of Pinkerton agents.Jameson, p. 71 In 1900 Stratton sold the Independence mine to the Venture Corporation of London for $10 million. The Venture Corporation incorporated the property as Stratton's Independence Ltd and sold shares on the London stock exchange. The ore reserves were discovered to be less than previously thought in late 1900, and the share price crashed. Venture Corporation sued Stratton, claiming that the mine had been salted. Stratton died in 1902, but his estate defeated the lawsuit. In May 1900, two Western Federation of Miners (WFM) union representatives checked for union membership cards at the Independence mine. Approximately a hundred miners belonged to the union, and six or eight did not. One of the union representatives talked to the miners, who echoed the union rep's view that they would prefer not to work alongside non-union workers. Mine Superintendent Summers talked the non-union men into joining the union in order to promote harmony in the workforce.Jameson, p. 74 In September 1900, the Independence mine was the first mine in the district to introduce a new stripping order requiring all underground workers to undress in one room of a change house and walk into another room in the nude while a guard observed. This was to take place at start and end of each shift. The new rule was implemented to prevent high grading (theft of gold ore) by the mine workers. Five hundred miners met at Victor's Armory Hall, and they decided that while they would help stop ore thieves, they refused to work under the stripping rule. A compromise was reached which allowed the miners to strip to their undergarments. But the miners were unhappy. After the new practice was in place for about a month, a Pinkerton searched the miners at the end of a shift. No ore was found, and the miners walked out. Three days later, Independence mine manager A.H. Shipman met with the WFM Executive Board. He ultimately agreed to abolish the Pinkerton guard system, to appoint a guard for the change rooms from candidates the union proposed, and to accept a closed shop. Under the agreement, any miner suspected of high-grading could be searched by a fellow union member in the presence of a watchman. Shipman also announced that he would support membership in the WFM by miners in return for the union's help in stopping the practice of high grading.Jameson, p. 71-72 In 1902 the miners at the Independence mine bought diamond rings for Shipman, who had negotiated the closed shop, for Superintendent Sam Lobb, and for Assistant Manager R.J. Grant. The miners and the managers enjoyed a \\"little smoking session\\" at Shipman's home after the presentation.Jameson, p. 102 Colorado Labor Wars In 1903 there was a major strike by the Western Federation of Miners. Many miners throughout the Cripple Creek District walked out of any mines that were shipping ore to the mills at Colorado City, in order to support a strike by the mill workers there. =Cage mishap kills fifteen= On the night of January 26, 1904, non-union replacement workers were coming off shift in the Independence Mine when the cage that they were riding in had a serious mishap. The cage was drawn into the sheave wheel at the top of the shaft. The cable that supported the cage was severed, and the cage fell.Jameson, p. 215 Fifteen miners fell into the shaft, 1500 feet deep.Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 100. The investigation focused on safety arrangements, and the qualifications of the hoisting engineer.Wyman, p. 101 One miner, James Bullock, survived the accident. His testimony to the coroner's jury describes the disaster: > ... We kept going right along but it kept slipping; we would go a little > ways and then we would slip again; then he took us about six feet above the > collar of the shaft, then he lowered us back down. > Q. Did he stop six feet above the shaft? > A. He stopped just for a second or two; then he lowered us and it must have > gotten beyond his control, for we dropped about sixty or seventy feet, we > were going pretty. [sic] We said to each other we are all gone. Then he > raised us up about ten feet; then he stopped us and it slipped back again, > and we went to the sheave wheel as fast as we could go. When I was going up > there, I began to crouch to save myself from the hard blow. I seen a piece > of timber about one foot wide, and I grabbed hold and held myself up there > and pretty soon the cage dropped and I began to holler for a ladder to get > down.Wyman, p. 100-101 The hoisting engineer's testimony is also quite descriptive of the incident: > I tried several times, but that time the cage was at the collar of the > shaft. I immediately reversed the engine and sent the cage back 100 feet. I > again tried the brakes, reversed the engine, and brought the cage back to > the surface. The brake was still stuck; I could not move it. I again > reversed the engine and sent the cage back about the same distance and > stepped over to the other side and took hold of the other brake, and it was > in the same condition. The second time the cage came to the surface, I > called three times for the shift boss, for God's sake come and help me put > on the brakes. In the meantime, I was reversing the engine backwards and > forwards. Mr. MacDonald came and two other men with him. I said come up and > help me put on the brakes, and then I discovered the hood of the cage above > the collar of the shaft. I immediately reversed the engine, but it was too > late. The coroner's jury found the brakes had been inspected six hours before the accident, and the brakes were working after the accident.Wyman, p. 101-102 The coroner's jury questioned another hoisting engineer from the Stratton Mine about the qualifications of the engineer operating the hoist. They learned that \\"the employer had taken the man's word ‚Äì nothing more ‚Äì as to his qualifications. The engineer involved in the fatal accident, however, had been recommended by a former employer.\\" The coroner's report stated that the engineer had lost control because of management's negligence, having failed to properly install a safety device to prevent overwinding. Also, the [backup braking system consisting of] disk brakes on the hoisting engine had been detached. The Western Federation of Miners echoed the coroner's charge of mismanagement. Although the property was at that time guarded by soldiers and enclosed by the main militia encampment, providing no access to union members, management accused the union of tampering with the machinery. One hundred and sixty-eight non-union men reportedly quit the Independence Mine because of the incident. Just a few months later, after several violent incidents occurred in the district, the WFM was driven out by force of arms in a struggle that came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars. Geology stopes in the Independence vein. The Washington claim is within granite, while the Independence is within a breccia, which was a better gold producer. The Independence shaft reached 70 feet by 1894 and was producing 800 tons of ore per month, with 3.5 ounces of gold per ton. In 1895, the shaft reached 300 feet, and was producing 90 tons per month. The shaft was down to 900 feet by 1897 when Venture Corporation Ltd. purchased the property. Phonolite dikes permeate both the granite and the breccia. \\"In many places ore occurs in phonolite dikes, nearly always as calaverite in very narrow fissures associated with fluorite and quartz as gangue\\".

He worked as an official war artist to the Australian government in 1919, and from then on specialised in war subjects until his death in 1930. Early life Coates was born in Emerald Hill (now South Melbourne, Victoria), the son of John Coates, an artist-lithographer of English stock, and his wife Elizabeth, a daughter of Ephraim Irwin who came from Ireland. George Coates was educated at St James Grammar School, then at the age of 15 was apprenticed to a firm of glass-stainers, Messrs. Ferguson and Urie. He attended the North Melbourne school of design and then joined the evening classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne under Frederick McCubbin. He could not, however, attend continuously. His father had died when he was eight years old and the boy was sometimes unable to afford the comparatively low fees. Though not tall he was beautifully formed, an excellent swimmer and a first-rate amateur boxer. Lionel Lindsay tells the story of how a trainer had suggested that he should give up art and take up a \\"man's work\\". Art career At the national gallery classes Coates won first prizes for drawing and for painting from the nude, and before the conclusion of his course opened a life class. Among the students associated with him were the Lindsay brothers, Max Meldrum and George Bell, all destined to become well known as artists. In 1896 he won the Melbourne national gallery travelling scholarship, and in 1897 went to Europe as did also a fellow competitor, Miss Dora Meeson, whom he was afterwards to marry. Coates entered Julien's classes and always felt that he had been fortunate in spending his student days in Paris at such a good period of French art, while Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas and Jean-Paul Laurens were still living. He met Miss Meeson again in Paris and they became engaged, but as his only income came from his scholarship their marriage had to be postponed. In 1900 Coates left Paris and took a studio in London. He obtained employment in supplying drawings for the Historian's History of the World, but after that ceased there was great difficulty in selling black and white work and portrait commissions were scarce. On 23 July 1903 Coates and Miss Meeson were married, her father having agreed to make the young couple an allowance of ¬£100 a year. Augustus John owned a studio which he let to them at ¬£50 a year, and a long struggle to obtain recognition followed. One early success was a portrait of Miss Jessica Strubelle, which gained an honourable mention at the salon of 1910 and is now in the Bendigo gallery; but Coates did not really come into notice until the 1912 Royal Academy exhibition where he had three important canvases hung, \\"Arthur Walker and his brother Harold\\", now at Melbourne, \\"Christine Silver\\", and \\"Mother and Child\\" now in the Adelaide gallery. The success of these pictures led to some commissions and the financial position became easier. The exhibition of the painting of the Walker brothers in 1913 at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux Arts led to his being elected an associate of that society, and full membership followed some years later. In 1913 Mrs Coates brought some of their pictures to Australia which were exhibited in Melbourne and Adelaide. However, Coates fell ill, and his wife had to abandon a proposed exhibition of his work at Sydney and returned with him to Europe where a holiday in Italy soon restored his health. World War I and late life Group portrait of Australian official war artists, 1916-1918 by George Coates, 1920. Oil on canvas, 124.2 x 104.5 cm. The painting presents, left to right: front ‚Äî George Bell; standing ‚Äî John Longstaff, Charles Bryant, George Washington Lambert, A. Henry Fullwood, James Quinn, H. Septimus Power, Arthur Streeton; and seated back ‚Äî Will Dyson, Fred Leist. When World War I came, Coates joined the Territorial R.A.M.C. and worked as a ward orderly. He was promoted to be a sergeant and given charge of the recreation room. In April 1919 he became an official war artist to the Australian government, and made several paintings of war scenes. But he had felt the strain of the war very much, and in April 1919 was officially discharged as \\"no longer physically fit for war service\\". He, however, was able to go on with his paintings of war subjects. In 1921 he revisited Australia, exhibitions were held at the principal cities, and several pictures were sold. Returning to England in 1922 busy years of painting followed, but his health was often not good. He died suddenly on 27 July 1930. Artistic summary Coates was primarily a portrait painter, but when opportunity offered he could manage a subject painting with great ability showing beautiful feeling for rhythm and composition. His painting was usually low toned without losing luminosity, and the drawing was always excellent. He is represented in the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong and Castlemaine art galleries, and at the Australian war museum, Canberra. Some examples of his work are also in English galleries and at the Canadian war museum. He was survived by his wife Dora Meeson Coates, a capable artist, who is also represented in Australian galleries. How much his wife meant to Coates may be gathered from the statement made by a friend that \\"he was utterly unhappy separated from her\\".

According to Gumilov his father was B√∂ri Shad, however Chavannes attributes him to be a son of Irbis Seguy. He was awarded with the title shad by Dulu khagan in 633 and oppointed to govern certain tribes including Chuye, Qarluq, Nushibi. In 646 he rose against Irbis Seguy only to be defeated by him. He fled to China in 25 April 648 and had served the Tang dynasty as a general stationed in Mohe (Ëé´Ë≥Ä) city in Gansu. However he soon started to plan to assert independence using Taizong's death in 649. Qiao Baoming (Ê©ãÂØ∂Êòé) personal staff of Gaozong tried to avert it by ordering him to deliver his son Ashina Xiyun (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£Âí•ÈÅã) to serve in palace guard. Xiyun served for a while before returning to Helu again and encouraging him to attack Irbis Dulu khagan.  Reign  After a while he set up his horde near modern Shuanghe, began to receive submissions.

Angered Gaozong stripped him of Chinese titlesXiang, Han (2006), Dust in the Wind: Retracing Dharma Master Xuanzang's Western Pilgrimage, Rhythms Monthly, p. 137 and ordered Qibi Heli and Liang Jianfang (Ê¢ÅÂª∫Êñπ) to secure border areas. Conflicts also began in southern border when Zhenzhu yabgu (son of Yukuk Shad) started major incursions to Western Tujue territory. Later Zhenzhu contacted Tang to receive soldiers and requested to be created a qaghan in 655. Yuan Lichen (ÂÖÉÁ§ºËá£) was ordered by Gaozong to visit Zhenzhu in 8 November 656 to create him khagan, but he was stopped by Helu's soldiers near Suyab, causing Zhenzhu to lose much prestige.

Nicknamed \\"Flippa\\", Thorp was the first true champion player to emerge at Richmond after their admission to the VFL in 1908. A natural defender who showed great judgement, superior ball skills and fierce concentration, Thorp was considered the best player in the game at his position, full back. His battles with Collingwood forward Dick Lee were a highlight of the era. Thorp was one of many great players who grew up in the shadow of the Tigers' Punt Road Oval and served the club loyally for many years, thus influencing the development of the parochial culture of the Richmond club.  Formative years As a child, Thorp attended the Yarra Park School (now defunct), just a few hundred metres to the north of Punt Road Oval and played his early football there. After leaving school in 1907, he joined Beverley, a club in the Metropolitan Football Association. At this time, the VFL didn't conduct a reserves competition, so district clubs (such as Beverley) acted as a de facto reserves teams. Also non-existent was any form of zoning, so Thorp was free to accept an invitation to trial with St Kilda. The Saints made one of the great errors in rejecting Thorp, who went to Richmond in 1910. In its early seasons in the VFL, Richmond frantically turned over dozens of players looking for a combination that could compete with the best in the competition. It would prove a long, drawn out process. While most failed and disappeared quickly, the Tigers knew immediately they had a find in the nineteen-year-old with the swarthy complexion. In his debut season, Thorp walked straight into the team and played all eighteen games. As a full back, he impressed with his fine judgement when going for the ball. He instinctively knew when to play from behind and when to position himself in front, when to mark and when to spoil and read the play so well he never seemed to be caught out of position. Although only of average height (178 cm), Thorp was very solidly built at 83 kg and his kicking skills stood out. Charged with the duty of kicking in after the opposition had scored a behind, Thorp regularly thrilled the crowd with glorious long drop kicks to clear the Tigers' defensive area.  The War era When numbers were first used on players' guernseys in 1912, Thorp received the number 5. By the outbreak of World War I he was a veteran of five seasons, during which he had missed just four matches. Although considered one of the best defenders in the game, Thorp had not yet been chosen for Victoria when state matches went into recess because of the war. Perhaps Thorp's failure to win representative honours was influenced by the mediocre performances of his team. Despite producing a number of brilliant individuals, the best of whom was Thorp, the club couldn't create a synergy between its off-field and on-field personnel, and constantly turned over its leadership positions and endured several take-overs at committee level. Unlike many of his teammates, Thorp decided against enlistment for the war. In 1916, the VFL competition was reduced to just four clubs, but still played a finals series. Richmond decided to compete and were guaranteed a place in the finals for the first time, and went on to an unlucky semi final loss to Carlton by three points. In another truncated season, the Tigers finished the season last of the six teams. The following year was little better for the team, but at least the war finally ended on 11 November and football could look forward to a return to normal.  Success at last With the appointment of ex-Carlton premiership coach Norm Clark and many of the Tigers' best players returning from military service in Europe, 1919 proved to be the turning point for Richmond. Thorp was in career-best form, gaining life membership of the club and representing Victoria for the first time when interstate fixtures were resumed. The team made the Grand Final, to the surprise of many, only to lose to Collingwood. In the following year, Richmond stirred the rivalry with the Magpies by appointing ex-Collingwood skipper Dan Minogue as playing coach. After winning the minor premiership, Richmond went on to defeat Collingwood for the flag. With Dick Lee injured and unable to take his place in the Magpies side, Thorp was able to easily blanket his replacement, Harry Curtis, and contribute significantly to the result. Richmond followed up with a second flag in 1921. At the business end of the season, Thorp dominated the semi final thrashing of Geelong and was instrumental in two upset victories over Carlton by winning his duels with the Blues' captain Gordon Green. The team slipped backwards in 1922-23, due to retirements and transfers, but a highlight came on 22 June 1922, when in a match at Fitzroy, Vic Thorp became the first Tiger to play 200 VFL games. Richmond returned to finals action in 1924. The Tigers won their last final, against Essendon, but didn't win the premiership as the Grand Final was abolished and a round robin tournament played in its stead. This controversial system was never used again to decide the premiership, which was little consolation to the disenfranchised Richmond players.  Retirement and after After the belated start to his representative career, Thorp had racked up an amazing fourteen appearances in the Big V in only six years. Heading into the 1925 season aged 34, Thorp played every week and then decided to retire, still on top of his game. In sixteen seasons, he had missed just ten matches, with his worst injury a broken wrist that cost him three games in 1914. Overall, it was a tribute to his sportsmanship and integrity as a player. During his career he had played a major part in the Tigers' rise from mediocrity to the dizzy heights of winning successive premierships that cemented their place as one of the powerhouses of the competition. Thorp appeared in every big game and final the Tigers played, and was always a steady influence when the chips were down. Unfortunately for the Tigers, they couldn't find an adequate replacement for him until the early 1930s, by which time they had lost a succession of Grand Finals when the weakness at full back was often exposed. Thorp was elected to the Richmond committee in 1927, after a brief sojourn at the VFA club Prahran, where he ironically played as a forward and led the club's goalkicking. Thorp remained a stalwart of Richmond all his life, running a tea merchant business in the suburb and serving as committeeman until 1935. He also wrote regular articles for Melbourne's Sporting Globe. When Thorp died in 1941, aged only 50, he was still Richmond's games played record holder.  AFL Team of the Century and Aboriginality In 1996, Thorp was elected as an inaugural member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, the only Richmond player of the pre-World War I era to receive the honour. It has been speculated in modern times that Thorp was aboriginal. Thorp had a noticeably dark complexion, but there is no evidence extant that he identified as aboriginal. Colin Tatz, academia's authority on aboriginal sportspeople, has listed Thorp as \\"possibly\\" an aborigine. Thorp's maternal grandfather, George Bryden Brandon, was born in Jamaica in 1824 to a Sephardic Jewish father and an African former enslaved person mother.

His band, known as Uncle Walt's Band, was involved in the alternative music scene in Austin, Texas, from its inception, and is credited by many with being the Godfather of Americana Music or the Original Americana Artist, never easily pegged into any one musical genre or format of commercial music styles. Early life Born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Walter Hyatt was exposed to different styles of music at an early age, including styles favored by his parents and the multifaceted nature of pop radio of the time. He started playing the guitar at age 13, using a Mel Bay chord book to learn all the music chords, and formed his first band in his midteen years. Walter attended Wofford College for two years, but left before graduation to pursue his music career. Music career At age 20, Hyatt formed Uncle Walt's Band with Champ Hood and David Ball, two of his fellow Spartanburg citizens. They moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1972, where they caught the attention of Willis Alan Ramsey, a famous and revered Texas singer and songwriter. Luring them to his studio, Ramsey became the band's first noted fan. The band returned to the Carolinas in 1974, recording Blame It on the Bossanova, their first record, at Charlotte's Arthur Smith Studios. A year later, Uncle Walt's Band split up, with Hyatt returning to Nashville and forming a new band, The Contenders, with Champ Hood and Nashville musicians Steve Runkle, Tommy Goldsmith, and drummer Jimbeau Walsh. In 1978, Uncle Walt's Band played a reunion gig in Austin, and the success that followed kept the band together in subsequent years. That success was not limited to the South, however. Uncle Walt's Band gained a cult following around the world, ranging from the University of California - Berkeley to Moscow University in Russia. They released three more albums on what is now considered Austin's original independent labels, Lespedeza Record Company: An American in Texas, Uncle Walt's Band Recorded Live, and Six * Twenty-Six * Seventy-Nine. In 1987, Hyatt returned to Nashville with his wife, Heidi Hyatt, and there he embarked on a solo career. The work that resulted from this career move, while artistically fruitful and critically acclaimed, was never a commercial success. In 1990, Hyatt became the first vocalist for MCA's Master Series label. His first solo album from this label, titled King Tears, was produced by Lyle Lovett, who was a big fan of Uncle Walt's Band in his college days at Texas A&M; University. Lovett later offered Hyatt the opening-act slot during his music tours. In 1993, Hyatt released his second solo album, Music Town, on the Sugar Hill label. Hyatt's Some Unfinished Business, Volume One was released January 22, 2008, to rave reviews. Taken from the last songs Hyatt recorded before his death, the album brings artists and musicians together to add the finishing touches to Uncle Walt's extraordinary music. Producer Michael Killen, working with Heidi Hyatt, assembled a who's who of Nashville musicians to accomplish this task. Killen scoured tape after tape left behind by Walter to find the best performance of each song. Together with Nashville engineer Nick Sparks, the two prepared each track for overdubbing. Killen envisioned three albums of Walter's songs: A country album, an R&B; rock album, and a jazz/ballad- flavored album. Enough tracks were recorded for all three. The songs on Some Unfinished Business, Volume One - 2008, and Some Unfinished Business, Volume Two - 2010, represent these distinct Walter Hyatt styles. Death Hyatt died in the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 on May 11, 1996. He was 46. He was survived by his wife Heidi and their two children, Taylor and Rose Evelyn, and Walter's daughter Haley.Everett, Rich, Falling Stars: Air Crashes that Filled Rock & Roll Heaven. 167 Tributes In 1997, an episode of the PBS show Austin City Limits featured a tribute to Hyatt put together by Lyle Lovett and various musicians who have had associations with him. Among the performers were Junior Brown, Shawn Colvin, Allison Moorer, Marcia Ball, David Halley, Willis Alan Ramsey, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Lovett, and his Uncle Walt's Band bandmates including guitarist/songwriter Rick Gordon, Champ Hood and David Ball. In 2008, the Austin Music Awards put together a tribute to Walter. Lovett and Ball were joined by Champ Hood's son, singer and fiddle player Warren Hood, as well as Champ Hood's nephew, singer and guitarist Marshall Hood of The Belleville Outfit.

He is the head football coach at Samford University, a position he has held since 2014. Hatcher served as the head football coach at Valdosta State University from 2000 to 2006, Georgia Southern University from 2007 to 2009, and Murray State University from 2010 to 2014. His Valdosta State Blazers won the NCAA Division II Football Championship in 2004. Hatcher played college football as a quarterback at Valdosta State from 1991 to 1994. Playing career A two-time All-American quarterback at Valdosta State University, Hatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns during his stellar career. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first-ever postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals. When his career was completed, Hatcher set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. Among the national records he once set were a 68.5 career completion percentage and streak of 20 straight completions in a game against New Haven. Hatcher was also successful in the classroom. Twice he received the Gulf South Conference‚Äôs Commissioner‚Äôs Trophy (which is awarded to the league‚Äôs Most Outstanding Student-Athlete). He finished his senior year by winning several national honors including: the NCAA Top Eight Award, the CoSIDA Academic All- America National Player of the Year and a postgraduate scholarship from the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame. In 1994, he won the Harlon Hill Trophy, awarded to the NCAA Division II National Player of the Year. Hatcher graduated from Valdosta State in 1995. Coaching career=Valdosta State The winningest coach in Blazers' history, Hatcher was 76‚Äì12 at his alma mater. When Hatcher took over as head coach in 2000, he wasted no time molding the Valdosta State program into the \\"Hatch Attack\\". In his first year back at VSU, Hatcher took a 4‚Äì7 squad the previous year and turned it around to a 10‚Äì2 record (8‚Äì1 in GSC action) and berth in the Division II playoffs. Hatcher‚Äôs coaching staff at Valdosta State in 2000 included future SEC head coaches Will Muschamp and Kirby Smart. His 2001 and 2002 teams posted back-to-back undefeated records during the regular season, part of a Gulf South Conference record 35 straight victories during the regular season. During the 2004 championship season, the Blazers lost their season-opener before rattling off 14 consecutive victories, capped by a 36‚Äì31 victory over Pittsburg State in the title game. Hatcher was named \\"National Coach of the Year\\" by the American Football Coaches Association and was the offensive coordinator for the East squad at the Hula Bowl. In 2005, Valdosta opened the season ranked No. 1 for four straight weeks and saw the season culminate with a sixth-straight NCAA postseason appearance. Despite an 8‚Äì2 record in 2006, the 10th-ranked Blazers did not receive an invitation to the playoffs, marking the first time that occurred in the Hatcher era. 2006's team finished sixth nationally in passing offense (283 yards per game), 12th in scoring offense (34.9 ppg) and 19th in total offense (389.9 yards). However, Hatcher‚Äôs teams have been successful in all three facets. The 2006 defense ranked 27th nationally in scoring defense (15.7 points allowed) while the special teams ranked third in punt returns (17.3 yards) and blocked seven kicks. Georgia Southern Georgia Southern Director of Athletics Sam Baker announced the hiring of Hatcher as head football coach in January 2007. \\"There were a lot of qualified candidates, but Chris Hatcher was someone I felt embodied all we were looking for,\\" said Baker. \\"Chris has a proven track record as a head coach ‚Äì capturing the national championship in 2004 and recording an .864 winning percentage during his seven-year tenure at Valdosta State. I looked for a coach who knows how to win and I believe Coach Hatcher can do that at the Division I level. I also wanted to hire a coach with strong recruiting ties in Georgia and Florida. Coach Hatcher knows the area well‚Ä¶ Our Athletic Department‚Äôs charge was to go out and hire a head coach that will improve on the progress we made off the field, and have that translate to on- the-field success. I think we have that coach in Chris Hatcher.\\" On November 21, 2009, Georgia Southern Athletic Director, Sam Baker, announced the firing of Hatcher after the 2009 season. Murray State On December 21, 2009, Murray State University Athletic Director, Allen Ward, announced the hiring of Hatcher beginning the 2010 season. In his first year at Murray State Hatcher led the Racers to a 5‚Äì3 record in the Ohio Valley Conference (tied for fourth place), and a 6‚Äì5 record overall. 2010 was the Racers first winning season since 2004. Went 7‚Äì4 in the 2011 season. Samford On December 10, 2014, it was announced that Hatcher would be the new head coach of the Samford Bulldogs. He replaces Pat Sullivan, Samford's all-time leader in wins, who resigned mainly due to health reasons. Former Samford coaches include Bobby Bowden (later head coach at West Virginia and Florida State), Wayne Grubb (who led Samford to the NCAA College Division West Region II Championship in 1971), and Terry Bowden (later head coach at Auburn, North Alabama and Akron).

Life and career Schaefer was born in Wallingford, Connecticut, and lived in Oak Park, Illinois for much of his boyhood and young adulthood. He was the son of Elsie (n√©e Otterbein) and Louis Schaefer, who worked in sales. Schaefer studied stage directing at the Yale School of Drama. He began his directing career while serving in the U.S. Army Special Services during World War II. He directed over 50 plays for the troops. After being discharged, he directed for the Broadway theatre. His first production was of Shakespeare's Hamlet starring Maurice Evans. In 1953, Schaefer won a Tony Award for his production of The Teahouse of the August Moon which he co- produced with Evans. During the Golden Age of Television, Schaefer directed numerous live TV adaptations of Broadway plays for NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame. His first episode for Hallmark was an adaptation of his Broadway staging of Hamlet starring Evans. In the 1980s, several of his productions for Hallmark aired in syndication under the title George Schaefer Showcase Theatre. His television work garnered him five Emmy wins out of 21 total nominations. He also won four Directors Guild of America Awards out of 17 nominations. He holds the record for the most DGA Award nominations. He also directed five theatrical films but to limited success. In February 1962, actors who had worked with Schaefer, including Ed Wynn, Ethel Griffies and Boris Karloff, participated in a tribute to him on the late-night talk show PM East/PM West that was syndicated by Group W Productions to Westinghouse-owned television stations in Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and San Francisco, as well as to other stations in Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles. This telecast holds the distinction of being the only episode of PM East/PM West, which aired five nights a week for more than a year, to survive in its entirety. A videocassette of the 1962 telecast is available for viewing at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.UCLA catalog known as Melvyl has a listing for the only surviving telecast of PM East/PM West. PM East/PM West was never accessible in Chicago, Illinois, the American South, the Southwestern United States, the Pacific Northwest or in the states of Florida or Texas. From 1979 to 1981, George Schaefer was president of the Directors Guild of America. He was as a board member of President Ronald Reagan's National Council on the Arts from 1982 to 1988. In 1985, he was appointed Chairman and later associate Dean at the UCLA School of Theater Film and Television where he stayed until 1991. During the 1980s and 1990s Schaefer served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. Schaefer also was the Honorary Chairperson of the Institute for a one year term. In 1996, he released his autobiography From Live to Tape to Film: 60 Years of Inconspicuous Directing. Schaefer continued directing TV movies until his death in 1997. His final TV movie was an adaptation of Harvey.

Tom Bradley: The Impossible Dream : A Biography Roundtable Pub. The chapter about Bradley Effect (Chapter 16 / pp. 243 ‚Äì 288) is available online at is a theory concerning observed discrepancies between voter opinion polls and election outcomes in some United States government elections where a white candidate and a non-white candidate run against each other.Reddy, Patrick. (January 20, 2002). \\"Does McCall Have A Chance?\\", Buffalo News, p. H1 The theory proposes that some white voters who intend to vote for the white candidate would nonetheless tell pollsters that they are undecided or likely to vote for the non-white candidate. It was named after Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African-American who lost the 1982 California governor's race despite being ahead in voter polls going into the elections. The Bradley effect posits that the inaccurate polls were skewed by the phenomenon of social desirability bias.Perez, Simon. (October 9, 2008). \\"Could Bradley Effect Change November Election? \\" KPIX-TV, \\"Political Consultant Don Solem explains: 'It's not so much they're afraid to say it as they think it might be taken the wrong way.' Solem said the Bradley Effect is also known as social desirability bias.\\"Rojas, Aurelio. (October 9, 2008). \\"California poll on Prop. 8 could show 'Bradley effect' \\" Sacramento Bee, \\"'Anyone who studies survey research will tell you one of the biggest problems we encounter is this notion of social desirability bias,' [Patrick Egan, a professor of politics at New York University] said.\\" Specifically, some voters give inaccurate polling responses for fear that, by stating their true preference, they will open themselves to criticism of racial motivation. Members of the public may feel under pressure to provide an answer that is deemed to be more publicly acceptable, or 'politically correct'. The reluctance to give accurate polling answers has sometimes extended to post- election exit polls as well. The race of the pollster conducting the interview may factor into voters' answers. Some analysts have dismissed the theory of the Bradley effect, or argued that it may have existed in past elections, but not in more recent ones, such as when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States in 2008 and 2012. Others believe that it is a persistent phenomenon.A Base Election After All? Weekly Standard; Aaron Miskin; November 11, 2008 Similar effects have been posited in other contexts, for example, the shy Tory factor and spiral of silence. Origin In 1982, Tom Bradley, the long-time mayor of Los Angeles, ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of California against Republican candidate George Deukmejian, who is white (of Armenian descent). Most polls in the final days before the election showed Bradley with a significant lead.Nelson, Colleen McCain. (August 10, 2002). \\" Race makes state races hard to call\\", Dallas Morning News Based on exit polls, a number of media outlets projected Bradley as the winner and early editions of the next day's San Francisco Chronicle featured a headline proclaiming \\"Bradley Win Projected.\\" However, despite winning a majority of the votes cast on election day, Bradley narrowly lost the overall race once absentee ballots were included. Post-election research indicated that a smaller percentage of white voters actually voted for Bradley than polls had predicted, and that previously undecided voters had voted for Deukmejian in statistically anomalous numbers.Rojas, Aurelio. (October 9, 2008). \\"California poll on Prop. 8 could show 'Bradley effect' \\" Sacramento Bee, \\"DiCamillo said a postelection analysis conducted by his organization found 'nine out of 10' undecided respondents wound up voting for Deukmejian.\\" A month prior to the election, Bill Roberts, Deukmejian's campaign manager, predicted that white voters would break for his candidate. He told reporters that he expected Deukmejian to receive approximately 5 percent more votes than polling numbers indicated because white voters were giving inaccurate polling responses to conceal the appearance of racial prejudice. Deukmejian disavowed Roberts's comments, and Roberts resigned his post as campaign manager.(1982, October 13). \\"AIDE TO COAST G.O.P. CANDIDATE RESIGNS AFTER REMARKS ON RACISM\\", The New York Times Some news sources and columnistsChadwick, Alex.

(October 2, 2008). \\"The 'Bradley effect' in 2008\\", Los Angeles Times have attributed the theory's origin to Charles Henry, a professor of African-American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Henry researched the election in its aftermath and, in a 1983 study, reached the controversial conclusion that race was the most likely factor in Bradley's defeat. However, one critic of the Bradley effect theory has charged that Mervin Field of The Field Poll had already offered the theory as explanation for his poll's errors, suggesting it (without providing supporting data for the claim) on the day after the election. Ken Khachigian, a senior strategist and day-to-day tactician in Deukmejian's 1982 campaign, has noted that Field's final pre-election poll was badly timed, since it was taken over the weekend, and most late polls failed to register a surge in support for Deukmejian in the campaign's final two weeks.Ken Khachigian. (November 2, 2008). \\"If Obama Loses: Don't Blame the Bradley Effect\\",\\"The Washington Post In addition, the exit polling failed to consider absentee balloting in an election which saw an \\"unprecedented wave of absentee voters\\" organized on Deukmejian's behalf. In short, Khachigian argues, the \\"Bradley effect\\" was simply an attempt to come up with an excuse for what was really the result of flawed opinion polling practices.Kachigian, op. cit. 1983 to 1992 Other elections which have been cited as possible demonstrations of the Bradley effect include the 1983 race for Mayor of Chicago, the 1988 Democratic primary race in Wisconsin for President of the United States, and the 1989 race for Mayor of New York City.Polman, Dick. (January 21, 2007). \\"Barack Obama's race seems to be a second-tier issue\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"The American Debate\\" \\"One can also argue, however, that the wind at Obama's back might not be nearly as strong as it seems. Despite the fact that Americans seem downright bullish about backing a qualified black presidential candidate ‚Äì in a December Newsweek poll, 93 percent said they would vote for such a person ‚Äì there is also the nagging possibility that a lot of people don't really mean it, that they merely want to sound PC when the pollster calls. There's even a name for this kind of behavior. Actually, several names. 'The Bradley effect' is named for black Democrat Tom Bradley, who ran for governor of California in 1982 after serving as mayor of Los Angeles. Whites told pollsters they were pro-Bradley, but on election day they voted for the white Republican, costing Bradley the race. Then there is the 'Wilder effect,' named for black Virginia Democrat Doug Wilder. While running for governor in 1989, he was thought to be ahead by 10 percentage points, buoyed by a big white vote. But in the end, he won in a squeaker because most white voters bailed out. Jesse Jackson had a similar experience in 1988. As a presidential candidate, he was supposedly cruising toward a primary season win in heavily white Wisconsin. But what the white Democratic voters had told the pollsters, and what they actually did, turned out to be very different, and Jackson was beaten. Colin Powell was well-aware of this syndrome when he was weighing a candidacy in 1995; a friend reportedly warned him, 'When they go in the booth, they ain't going to vote for you.' Some analysts have assumed that the same syndrome helped doom Harold Ford Jr., the black Democrat who lost a Senate race in Tennessee in November by only three percentage points; indeed, he was apparently hurt by a GOP TV ad that implied he partied with white girls. The facts, however, suggest otherwise. His projected share of the white vote, as measured by the pre-election polls, closely tracked his share on election day.\\"Derbyshire, John. (May 15, 2007). \\"None of the Above \\", National Review Online \\"When David Dinkins, an African-American, ran for mayor of New York City, he won. He didn't win by anything like the margin the pollsters were predicting, though, and Dinkins's win left those pollsters scratching their heads. Where had the missing Dinkins voters gone? The common conclusion of the pollsters was that race is such a charged issue in the U.S.A. that people will lie about their intentions to vote for a black candidate all the way to the voting booth.\\" The 1983 race in Chicago featured a black candidate, Harold Washington, running against a white candidate, Bernard Epton. More so than the California governor's race the year before,Citrin, Jack and Donald Philip Green and David O. Sears. (Spring, 1990). \\"White Reactions to Black Candidates: When Does Race Matter?\\", Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 1, pp. 74‚Äì96 the Washington-Epton matchup evinced strong and overt racial overtones throughout the campaign.Isaacson, Walter.

(April 12, 1983). \\"Washington- Epton Race Was Often Ugly\\", WBBM-TV Two polls conducted approximately two weeks before the election showed Washington with a 14-point lead in the race. A third conducted just three days before the election confirmed Washington continuing to hold a lead of 14 points. But in the election's final results, Washington won by less than four points. In the 1988 Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin, pre-election polls pegged black candidate Jesse Jackson‚Äîat the time, a legitimate challenger to white candidate and frontrunner Michael Dukakis‚Äîas likely to receive approximately one-third of the white vote.Peterson, Bill. (April 4, 1988). \\"For Jackson, a Potential Breakthrough; On Eve of Primary, Support From White Officials and Wisconsin Voters Appears Strong\\", The Washington Post Ultimately, however, Jackson carried only about one quarter of that vote, with the discrepancy in the heavily white state contributing to a large margin of victory for Dukakis over the second-place Jackson.Dionne, E. J. Jr. (April 6, 1988). \\"Dukakis Defeats Jackson Handily in Wisconsin Vote\\", The New York Times In the 1989 race for Mayor of New York, a poll conducted just over a week before the election showed black candidate David Dinkins holding an 18-point lead over white candidate Rudy Giuliani. Four days before the election, a new poll showed that lead to have shrunk, but still standing at 14 points. On the day of the election, Dinkins prevailed by only two points. L. Douglas Wilder's margin of victory in the 1989 Virginia gubernatorial election was narrower than predicted by pre-election and exit polls. Similar voter behavior was noted in the 1989 race for Governor of Virginia between Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, an African-American, and Republican Marshall Coleman, who was white. In that race, Wilder prevailed, but by less than half of one percent, when pre- election poll numbers showed him on average with a 9 percent lead.Shapiro, Walter. (November 20, 1989). \\"Breakthrough in Virginia\\", Time \\"All the published pre-election surveys had shown Wilder leading his Republican rival J. Marshall Coleman by margins of 4% to 15%. Even an initial television exit poll had anointed Wilder with a 10 percentage-point triumph. But by the time Wilder felt comfortable enough to declare victory, his razor- thin lead had stabilized about where it would end up: just 6,582 votes out of a record 1.78 million ballots cast.\\"Keeler, Scott and Nilanthi Samaranayake. (February 7, 2007). \\"Can You Trust What Polls Say about Obama's Electoral Prospects?\\", Pew Research Center for the People & the Press The discrepancy was attributed to white voters telling pollsters that they were undecided when they actually voted for Coleman.Black, Chris. (November 9, 1989). \\"POLLSTERS SAY SOME VOTERS LIE\\", Boston Globe After the 1989 Virginia gubernatorial election, the Bradley effect was sometimes called the Wilder effect.Bacon, Perry Jr. (January 23, 2007). \\"Can Obama Count On the Black Vote?\\", Time \\"More than most politicians, Wilder knows personally how difficult it can be for a black candidate; during his gubernatorial campaign, the gap between his numbers in the final polls and in the actual election showed such a dramatic drop-off that it became known as the 'Wilder Effect.'\\" Both terms are still used; and less commonly, the term \\"Dinkins effect\\" is also used. Also sometimes mentioned are: * The 1987 mayoral race in Philadelphia between white former mayor Frank Rizzo and black incumbent Wilson Goode.Smerconish, Michael. (October 23, 2008). \\"Decoding the lawn signs\\", Philadelphia Daily News \\"Conventional wisdom is that people lie to pollsters in elections featuring candidates of different races. That's the Bradley effect, named for Tom Bradley, the L.A. mayor once believed to be a shoo-in for California governor. But the polls got that one all wrong. In a black-white race, the theory says, the black candidate polls better than he'll actually do on Election Day. I saw this firsthand in '87, when Wilson Goode Sr. was forecast to beat Frank Rizzo by double digits but won by only 2 percent. The post-election explanation? White liberals didn't want to tell a pollster they were voting for Rizzo. \\" Goode prevailed by a narrow margin, despite having had a significantly larger lead in pre-election polls.Kurtz, Howard. (1987, November 4). \\"Goode Holds Slim Majority; Challenger Rizzo Refuses to Concede\\", The Washington Post, Page A25 * The 1990 Senate race in North Carolina between black candidate Harvey Gantt and white candidate Jesse Helms. Gantt lost his race by six points. Two late polls showed Gantt ahead by four to six points, but one other showed a four-point Helms victory.West, Paul. (October 6, 2006). \\"Ford plays against type in bid for Senate upset\\", The Baltimore Sun \\"An independent statewide poll by Mason-Dixon, released this week, has Ford ahead by 1 percentage point. But public opinion surveys are notoriously unreliable when one of the candidates is black. Campaign strategists often subtract a \\"racial slippage\\" factor, to account for surveys that might exaggerate a black candidate's strength by up to 9 percentage points. In North Carolina, a Mason-Dixon poll a week before the 1990 election gave black Democrat Harvey Gantt a 4-point lead over Republican Sen. Jesse Helms; Gantt lost by 6 percentage points. In the 1989 Virginia governor's race, L. Douglas Wilder, a black Democrat, had an 11-point poll advantage a week before the election; he won by less than 1 point.

Braun won her general election race by 10 points, but polls indicated a margin of up to 20 points. However, polls had been just as erroneous, though this time underestimating Braun's support, during the primary election. Braun won that contest‚Äîalso against a white candidate‚Äîby three points after polls predicted she would lose by double digits. * During the early 1990s electoral contests with former Ku Klux Klan leader and Nazi sympathizer David Duke, many potential voters would not tell pollsters that they favored Duke (as they feared the ostracization that could result from being on record as being a Duke supporter), but would go on to vote for him anyway. The commentary at that time was that Duke \\"flies under the radar.\\" Mid‚Äì1990s Colin Powell was reportedly warned of the Bradley effect when he was considered to be a potential 1996 presidential candidate. In 1995, when Colin Powell's name was floated as a possible 1996 Republican presidential candidate, Powell reportedly spoke of being cautioned by publisher Earl G. Graves about the phenomenon described by the Bradley effect. With regard to opinion polls showing Powell leading a hypothetical race with then-incumbent Bill Clinton, Powell was quoted as saying, \\"Every time I see Earl Graves, he says, 'Look, man, don't let them hand you no crap. When [white voters] go in that booth, they ain't going to vote for you.'\\"Gates, Henry Louis Jr. (September 25, 1995). \\"Powell and the Black Elite\\", The New Yorker Possible diminished effects Analyses of recent elections suggest that there may be some evidence of a diminution in the 'Bradley Effect'. However at this stage such evidence is too limited to confirm a trend. 2003 Louisiana gubernatorial election A few analysts, such as political commentator and The Weekly Standard editor Fred Barnes, attributed the four-point loss by Indian American candidate Bobby Jindal in the 2003 Louisiana gubernatorial runoff election to the Bradley effect. In making his argument, Barnes mentioned polls that had shown Jindal with a lead.Barnes, Fred. (November 17, 2003). \\"The Wilder Effect\\", The Weekly Standard \\"Why did Jindal lose after leading his Democratic opponent, Kathleen Blanco, in statewide polls in the weeks before the election? In a word, race. What occurred was the 'Wilder effect,' named after the black Virginia governor elected in 1989. Wilder, a Democrat, polled well, then won narrowly. Many white voters, it turned out, said they intended to vote for a black candidate when they really didn't. Questioned by pollsters, they were leery of being seen as racially prejudiced.\\" Others, such as National Review contributor Rod Dreher, countered that later polls taken just before the election correctly showed that lead to have evaporated, and reported the candidates to be statistically tied.Dreher, Rod. (November 21, 2003). \\"Why Jindal Lost \\", National Review Online \\"You might chalk it up to the \\"Wilder Effect,\\" in which white voters tell pollsters they're going to vote for a minority candidate, but actually vote for the white one. If that were the case, though, Jindal's poll numbers would have held firm during the last week, and he would have received a shock on election day. In fact, his numbers collapsed steadily in the last week of the campaign, when Blanco's powerful commercial (featuring a Republican doctor in a wheelchair saying he was voting Blanco because Jindal is a heartless technocrat) began running in the state, and went unanswered by the Jindal camp. \\"Hill, John and Mike Hasten, Melody Brumble and Michelle Mahfoufi.

In 2006, there was speculation that the Bradley effect might appear in the Tennessee race for United States Senator between Harold Ford, Jr. and white candidate Bob Corker.Cose, Ellis. (October 30, 2006), \\"The 'Bradley Effect' \\", Newsweek \\"Is Harold Ford Jr. really doing as well as the polls suggest? Is he conceivably on his way to becoming the first black Southern senator since Reconstruction? The answer may well be yes, but Ford can hardly take that for granted.

(November 1, 2006). \\"Is Ford's white support for real? ‚Äî Political correctness can skew polling\\", Memphis Commercial Appeal Ford lost by a slim margin, but an examination of exit polling data indicated that the percentage of white voters who voted for him remained close to the percentage that indicated they would do so in polls conducted prior to the election.Alter, Jonathan. (2006, December 25‚Äì2, 007, January 1). \\"Is America Ready? \\", Newsweek \\"One piece of encouraging news from Tennessee is that the returns showed no signs of the 'Bradley Effect,' in which white voters tell pollsters they will vote for the black candidate, then go into the voting booth and choose someone else.\\" Several other 2006 biracial contests saw pre-election polls predict their respective elections' final results with similar accuracy. In the race for United States Senator from Maryland, black Republican candidate Michael Steele lost by a wider margin than predicted by late polls. However, those polls correctly predicted Steele's numbers, with the discrepancy in his margin of defeat resulting from their underestimating the numbers for his white Democratic opponent, then longtime Representative Ben Cardin. Those same polls also underestimated the Democratic candidate in the state's race for governor‚Äîa race in which both candidates were white. The overall accuracy of the polling data from the 2006 elections was cited, both by those who argue that the Bradley effect has diminished in American politics,Whitaker, Bill. (October 12, 2008). \\"A Matter of Race\\", CBS News Sunday Morning \\"CBS pollster Kathleen Frankovic doesn't see [the Bradley effect] any more. In recent elections with black candidates ‚Äì Deval Patrick's winning governor's race in Massachusetts, in Tennessee, Harold Ford losing his run for the Senate, both in 2006 ‚Äì the polls were right-on. 'I really do believe that the so-called Bradley effect is an artifact of a certain place and a certain time,' she said. 'It's an artifact of the 1980s.'\\" and those who doubt its existence in the first place. When asked about the issue in 2007, Douglas Wilder indicated that while he believed there was still a need for black candidates to be wary of polls, he felt that voters were displaying \\"more openness\\" in their polling responses and becoming \\"less resistant\\" to giving an accurate answer than was the case at the time of his gubernatorial election.Walker, Adrian. (January 4, 2007). \\"Sharing the Pride\\", The Boston Globe \\"I warned [Deval Patrick], you've got to watch those polls. But I think people are becoming less resistant to saying, 'I'm going to vote for the person whether it's a woman, or gay, or whatever.'

I think it's a mistake to think that there'll be any kind of big surprise like there was in the Bradley campaign in 1982. But I also think it'd be a mistake to say, 'It's all gone.'\\"Whitaker, Bill.

In the initial hours after voting concluded in the Bradley-Deukmejian race in 1982, similarly inaccurate exit polls led some news organizations to project Bradley to have won.Henry, William A. III. (November 15, 1982). \\"Fighting the Last War\\", Time \\"The most tangled polling errors came in California, where almost no one forecast Republican George Deukmejian's 50,000-vote victory over Tom Bradley. Indeed, the Los Angeles Times ran a frontpage story on election morning about the lineup of local politicians vying to succeed Bradley as the city's mayor. The San Francisco Chronicle's first election extra bannered: BRADLEY WIN PROJECTED. While ABC was predicting Deukmejian's victory, its affiliate stations in Los Angeles and San Francisco were using exit polls of their own to call the race for Bradley instead.\\" Republican pollster V. Lance Tarrance, Jr. argues that the exit polls were wrong because Bradley actually won on election day turnout, but lost the absentee vote.\\"The Bradley Effect ‚Äì Selective Memory\\", RealClearPolitics. Exit polls in the Wilder-Coleman race in 1989 also proved inaccurate in their projection of a ten-point win for Wilder, despite those same exit polls accurately predicting other statewide races.Rosenthal, Andrew. (November 9, 1989). \\"The 1989 Elections: Predicting the outcome; Broad disparities in votes and polls raising questions\\", The New York Times In 2006, a ballot measure in Michigan to end affirmative action generated exit poll numbers showing the race to be too close to call. Ultimately, the measure passed by a wide margin.Cooper, Desiree. (December 12, 2006). \\"Let's talk to break a White House tradition\\", Detroit Free Press Causes The causes of the polling errors are debated, but pollsters generally believe that perceived societal pressures have led some white voters to be less than forthcoming in their poll responses. These voters supposedly have harbored a concern that declaring their support for a white candidate over a non-white candidate will create a perception that the voter is racially prejudiced.Rowland, Ashley.

Researchers said white voters felt social pressure to tell pollsters they would vote for Mr. Bradley, who was black, but voted for his white opponent when they cast their ballots. Dr. Swain said the close margin of victory in the Corker-Ford contest shows whites did vote for Rep. Ford, and the 'Bradley effect' may be lessening.\\"Biegelsen, Amy. (January 9, 2008). \\"Obama's Wilder Lesson \\", Style Weekly \\"In 1989, nobody saw it coming save Paul Goldman, Wilder's longtime political Svengali, and Wilder ‚Äì now Richmond's mayor ‚Äì himself. Thanks in part to advice from campaign pollster Michael Donilon, who went on to advise John Kerry's 2004 bid for the White House, Goldman assumed that anything short of a definitive commitment of support from a white poll respondent couldn't be trusted and weighted his poll's statistical model accordingly. His poll indicated a virtual tossup, putting Wilder's chances at 50‚Äì50. ... 'This was a historic campaign,' Goldman says. 'Everybody was talking about it ‚Äì race, race, race ‚Äì so you give whatever answer's the socially acceptable one.'\\" During the 1988 Jackson presidential campaign, Murray Edelman, a veteran election poll analyst for news organizations and a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found the race of the pollster conducting the interview to be a factor in the discrepancy. Edelman's research showed white voters to be more likely to indicate support for Jackson when asked by a black interviewer than when asked by a white interviewer.Elder, Janet. (May 16, 2007). \\"Will There Be an 'Obama Effect?'\\", The New York Times \\"In high-profile contests where one of the major party candidates is black, pre-election telephone polls have often been wrong, overstating the strength of the black candidate. In polling circles this is known as the 'Bradley effect' or the 'Wilder effect' or the 'Dinkins effect.'\\" \\"During Jesse Jackson's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, Murray Edelman of CBS News and Rutgers University took a look at the effect the race of the interviewer might have had on the way people answered questions about who they intended to vote for. 'White respondents showed more support for Jackson when talking to black interviewers than the other way around,' said Mr. Edelman. 'The support for Jackson was less when white respondents talked to white interviewers.'\\" \\"Writing in The Polling Report, Mr. Brodnitz said the race of the interviewer was not a factor in their polling in 2006. Mr. Brodnitz said that problems in the final pre-election public polls had nothing to do with race, but were caused by methodology. Brodnitz contends that the public polling in the Ford race and perhaps the earlier errors in races with black candidates can be attributed in part to polling not taking full account of the types of voters who make their decisions very late in campaigns. He said those voters tended to be older married white women who were either political moderates or conservatives.\\" Andrew Kohut, who was the president of the Gallup Organization during the 1989 Dinkins/Giuliani race and later president of the Pew Research Center, which conducted research into the phenomenon, has suggested that the discrepancies may arise, not from white participants giving false answers, but rather from white voters who have negative opinions of blacks being less likely to participate in polling at all than white voters who do not share such negative sentiments with regard to blacks.Kohut, Andrew. (January 10, 2008). \\"Getting It Wrong\\", The New York Times \\"Poorer, less well-educated white people refuse surveys more often than affluent, better-educated whites. Polls generally adjust their samples for this tendency. But here's the problem: these whites who do not respond to surveys tend to have more unfavorable views of blacks than respondents who do the interviews. I‚Äôve experienced this myself. In 1989, as a Gallup pollster, I overestimated the support for David Dinkins in his first race for New York City mayor against Rudolph Giuliani; Mr. Dinkins was elected, but with a two percentage point margin of victory, not the 15 I had predicted. I concluded, eventually, that I got it wrong not so much because respondents were lying to our interviewers but because poorer, less well-educated voters were less likely to agree to answer our questions. That was a decisive factor in my miscall.\\"Holmes, Stephen A. (October 12, 2008). Pollsters Debate 'Bradley Effect', The Washington Post, Page A06 \\"Kohut recently conducted a study in which interviewers spent months repeatedly calling people back until they agreed to talk. He said that helped him see who is often missed in polling. 'Poorer, less-educated whites don't like to do these polls as much as better-educated people do,' he said. 'The refusals come from the same class of people who tend to be the most racially intolerant.'\\" While there is widespread belief in a racial component as at least a partial explanation for the polling inaccuracies in the elections in question, it is not universally accepted that this is the primary factor. Peter Brodnitz, a pollster and contributor to the newsletter The Polling Report, worked on the 2006 campaign of black U.S. Senate candidate Harold Ford, Jr., and contrary to Edelman's findings in 1988, Brodnitz indicated that he did not find the race of the interviewer to be a factor in voter responses in pre-election polls. Brodnitz suggested that late-deciding voters tend to have moderate-to-conservative political opinions and that this may account in part for last-minute decision-makers breaking largely away from black candidates, who have generally been more liberal than their white opponents in the elections in question. Another prominent skeptic of the Bradley effect is Gary Langer, the director of polling for ABC News. Langer has described the Bradley effect as \\"a theory in search of data.\\" He has argued that inconsistency of its appearance, particularly in more recent elections, casts doubt upon its validity as a theory.Koppelman, Alex. (January 24, 2008). \\"Will whites vote for Barack Obama?\\", Salon.com \\"'The argument of a specific Bradley effect,' insisted Langer, 'still looks to me to like a theory in search of data ... I don't see why this effect would be limited, before now, to a handful of elections 15 to 25 years ago. And I don't know how to understand its absence in so many other black-white races ‚Äì five [Senate and governors'] races in 2006 alone, as I note ‚Äì in which pre-election polling was dead on.' 'Newton's Law of Gravity doesn't just work on Thursdays,' Langer said. 'You want an effect to be clearly established as an effect through analysis of empirical data, and maybe in more than one election. And to call it an effect you want it to be a consistent effect, or to explain its inconsistency'\\". Of all of the races presented as possible examples of the Bradley effect theory, perhaps the one most fiercely rebutted by the theory's critics is the 1982 Bradley/Deukmejian contest itself. People involved with both campaigns, as well as those involved with the inaccurate polls have refuted the significance of the Bradley effect in determining that election's outcome. Former Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Mathews said that he talked to more than a dozen people who played significant roles in either the Bradley or Deukmejian campaign and that only two felt there was a significant race-based component to the polling failures.Mathews, Joe (2009) \\"The Bradley Effect Was about Guns, Not Racism \\" California Journal of Politics and Policy: Vol. 1 : Iss. 1, Article 27. DOI: 10.2202/1944-4370.1054 Mark DiCamillo, Director of The Field Poll, which was among those that had shown Bradley with a strong lead, has not ruled out the possibility of a Bradley effect as a minor factor, but also said that the organization's own internal examination after that election identified other possible factors that may have contributed to their error, including a shift in voter preference after the final pre-election polls and a high-profile ballot initiative in the same election, a Republican absentee ballot program and a low minority turnout, each of which may have caused pre- election polls to inaccurately predict which respondents were likely voters.Russo, Frank D. (January 9, 2008). The \\"Bradley Effect\\" on Obama- Clinton Polling in New Hampshire May Be Overstated \\"While the 1982 California gubernatorial contest is not the only race where the race of the candidate has been thought to be a factor in polling gone awry, there are a number of other reasons why the Field Poll may not have been accurate. I spoke with Mark DiCamillo, Director of the Field Poll‚Äîwhose phone has been ringing off the hook about this today. He told me that there was a memo done by the polling organization shortly after the election to try to understand what had occurred (not available online as it predated the internet) that identified four possible factors: 1\\\\. A late shift in voter preference after the poll, which could have reflected bias. 2\\\\. A well organized GOP absentee ballot program (Bradley won the day of election results). 3\\\\. The presence of a handgun initiative on the same ballot that brought out a skewed electorate different from the model used to predict likely voters. 4\\\\. Lower turnout by minorities because Bradley did not turn out the base of black voters. Prominent Republican pollster V. Lance Tarrance, Jr. flatly denies that the Bradley effect occurred during that election, echoing the absentee ballot factor cited by DiCamillo. Tarrance also reports that his own firm's pre-election polls done for the Deukmejian campaign showed the race as having closed from a wide lead for Bradley one month prior to the election down to a statistical dead heat by the day of the election. While acknowledging that some news sources projected a Bradley victory based upon Field Poll exit polls which were also inaccurate, he counters that at the same time, other news sources were able to correctly predict Deukmejian's victory by using other exit polls that were more accurate. Tarrance claims that The Field Poll speculated, without supplying supporting data, in offering the Bradley effect theory as an explanation for why its polling had failed, and he attributes the emergence of the Bradley effect theory to media outlets focusing on this, while ignoring that there were other conflicting polls which had been correct all along. Sal Russo, a consultant for Deukmejian in the race, has said that another private pollster working for the campaign, Lawrence Research, also accurately captured the late surge in favor of Deukmejian, polling as late as the night before the election. According to Russo, that firm's prediction after its final poll was an extremely narrow victory for Deukmejian. He asserts that the failure of pre-election polls such as The Field Poll arose, largely because they stopped polling too soon, and that the failure of the exit polls was due to their inability to account for absentee ballots.Russo, Sal. (October 20, 2008). \\"Tom Bradley Didn't Lose Because of Race\\", The Wall Street Journal \\"Private, daily tracking polls showed that, with a retooled campaign, Mr. Deukmejian methodically closed the gap. On the Sunday night before the day of the election‚Äîusually the last day of tracking polls the campaign will pay for‚ÄîMr. Deukmejian had closed to less than two percentage points. The campaign polled Monday night, too. It showed Mr. Deukmejian less than 1% behind. Private pollster Lawrence Research predicted to the campaign a razor-thin victory‚Äîexactly what happened. The public polls stopped polling too soon, missing the Deukmejian surge. Most important, they ignored the absentee ballot. Mr. Deukmejian's polling asked if people had voted absentee; other polls, including the exit polls, did not.\\" Blair Levin, a staffer on the Bradley campaign in 1982 said that as he reviewed early returns at a Bradley hotel on election night, he saw that Deukmejian would probably win. In those early returns, he had taken particular note of the high number of absentee ballots, as well as a higher-than-expected turnout in California's Central Valley by conservative voters who had been mobilized to defeat the handgun ballot initiative mentioned by DiCamillo. According to Levin, even as he heard the \\"victory\\" celebration going on among Bradley supporters downstairs, those returns had led him to the conclusion that Bradley was likely to lose.Levin, Blair. (October 19, 2008). \\"What Bradley Effect?\\", The New York Times \\"On election night in 1982, with 3,000 supporters celebrating prematurely at a downtown hotel, I was upstairs reviewing early results that suggested Bradley would probably lose. But he wasn't losing because of race. He was losing because an unpopular gun control initiative and an aggressive Republican absentee ballot program generated hundreds of thousands of Republican votes no pollster anticipated, giving Mr. Deukmejian a narrow victory. \\"Levin, Blair. (October 21, 2008). Interview, NPR John Phillips, the primary sponsor of the controversial gun control proposition, said that he felt as though he, rather than polling inaccuracies, was the primary target of the blame assigned by those present at the Bradley hotel that night. Nelson Rising, Bradley's campaign chair, spoke of having warned Bradley long before any polling concerns arose that endorsing the ballot initiative would ultimately doom his campaign. Rejecting the idea that the Bradley effect theory was a factor in the outcome, Rising said, \\"If there is such an effect, it shouldn't be named for Bradley, or associated with him in any way.\\" In 2008, several political analysts discussing the Bradley effect referred to a study authored by Daniel J. Hopkins, a post-doctoral fellow in Harvard University's Department of Government, which sought to determine whether the Bradley effect theory was valid, and whether an analogous phenomenon might be observed in races between a female candidate and a male candidate. Hopkins analyzed data from 133 elections between 1989 and 2006, compared the results of those elections to the corresponding pre-election poll numbers, and considered some of the alternate explanations which have been offered for any discrepancies therein. The study concluded finally that the Bradley effect was a real phenomenon, amounting to a median gap of 3.1 percentage points before 1996, but that it was likely not the sole factor in those discrepancies, and further that it had ceased to manifest itself at all by 1996. The study also suggested a connection between the Bradley effect and the level of racial rhetoric exhibited in the discussion of the political issues of the day. It asserted that the timing of the disappearance of the Bradley effect coincided with that of a decrease in such rhetoric in American politics over such potentially racially charged issues as crime and welfare. The study found no evidence of a corresponding effect based upon gender ‚Äì in fact, female Senate candidates received on average 1.2 percentage points more votes than polls had predicted. 2008 United States presidential election Some have suggested that President Barack Obama may have encountered both the Bradley effect, and a \\"reverse\\" Bradley effect, during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary elections. The 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, a black United States Senator, brought a heightened level of scrutiny to the Bradley effect, as observers searched for signs of the effect in comparing Obama's polling numbers to the actual election results during the Democratic primary elections.Jones, Jackie. (January 2, 2008). \\"Barack Obama, Unelectable ‚ÄòHopemonger?‚Äô Campaign, Polls Proving the Naysayers Wrong \\", BlackAmericaWeb.com \\"Still, there are people who believe what Edley called 'the Bradley factor' could stall Obama's campaign. When Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran for governor in California in 1982, all the polls had him leading handily, 'but when people got behind the curtain, they couldn't pull the lever' for him, Edley said. 'The question is to what extent does that Bradley effect still an effect 25 years later?'\\" After a victorious showing in the Iowa caucuses, where votes were cast publicly, polls predicted that Obama would also capture the New Hampshire Democratic primary election by a large margin over Hillary Clinton, a white senator. However, Clinton defeated Obama by three points in the New Hampshire race, where ballots were cast secretly, immediately initiating suggestions by some analysts that the Bradley effect may have been at work.Tabin, John. (January 9, 2008). \\"It's Crying Time Again\\", The American Spectator \\"So how did she do it? How did Hillary Clinton defy Barack Obama's double- digit lead in the New Hampshire polls and pull out a victory yesterday? Hindsight being 20/20, we can now see that she had a few things going for her. ...The Bradley Effect. Named for Tom Bradley, the Los Angeles mayor who narrowly lost the 1982 race for California governor despite a lead in the polls, this is the tendency of black candidates to under-perform their poll numbers. Whether because of closet racism or a more innocent reluctance to appear politically incorrect, a statistically significant number of voters often tell pollsters they'll vote for a black candidate, but turn around and vote for a white opponent in the privacy of the ballot box. The effect seems to have diminished in recent election cycles, but may have played a role in New Hampshire.\\" Other analysts cast doubt on that hypothesis, saying that the polls underestimated Clinton rather than overestimated Obama. Clinton may have also benefited from the primacy effect in the New Hampshire primary as she was listed ahead of Obama on every New Hampshire ballot. After the Super Tuesday primaries of February 5, 2008, political science researchers from the University of Washington found trends suggesting the possibility that with regard to Obama, the effect's presence or absence may be dependent on the percentage of the electorate that is black. The researchers noted that to that point in the election season, opinion polls taken just prior to an election tended to overestimate Obama in states with a black population below eight percent, to track him within the polls' margins of error in states with a black population between ten and twenty percent, and to underestimate him in states with a black population exceeding twenty-five percent. The first finding suggested the possibility of the Bradley effect, while the last finding suggested the possibility of a \\"reverse\\" Bradley effect in which black voters might have been reluctant to declare to pollsters their support for Obama or are underpolled. For example, many general election polls in North Carolina and Virginia assume that black voters will be 15% to 20% of each state's electorate; they were around a quarter of each state's electorate in 2004. That high support effect has been attributed to high black voter turnout in those states' primaries, with blacks supporting Obama by margins that often exceeded 97%. With only one exception, each state that had opinion polls incorrectly predict the outcome of the Democratic contest also had polls that accurately predicted the outcome of the state's Republican contest, which featured only white candidates).Schwarz, Joel. (February 6, 2008). \\"Super Tuesday results indicate race card may be a joker in primaries \\", University of Washington Office of News and Information Alternatively, Douglas Wilder has suggested that a 'reverse Bradley effect' may be possible because some Republicans may not openly say they will vote for a black candidate, but may do so on election day.Will closet racism derail Obama?, BBC News, October 20, 2008 The \\"Fishtown Effect\\" is a scenario where prejudiced or racist white voters cast their vote for a black candidate solely on economic concerns. Fishtown, a mostly white and economically depressed neighborhood in Philadelphia, voted 81% for Obama in the 2008 election. Alternatively, writer Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez suggested another plausible factor is something called the \\"Huxtable effect\\", where the positive image of the respectable African American character Cliff Huxtable, a respected middle-class pediatrician and father on the 1980s television series The Cosby Show, made young voters who grew up with that series' initial run comfortable with the idea of an African American man being a viable presidential candidate, which enhanced Obama's election chances with that population.Valdes-Rodriguez, Alisa (November 2, 2008). \\"The Huxtable Effect\\" AlterNet Others have called it the \\"Palmer effect\\" on the theory that David Palmer, a fictional president played by Dennis Haysbert during the second and third seasons of the television drama 24, showed viewers that an African American man can be a strong commander in chief. This election was widely scrutinized as analysts tried to definitively determine whether the Bradley effect is still a significant factor in the political sphere.Robinson, Eugene. (January 11, 2008). \\"Echoes Of Tom Bradley\\", The Washington Post \\"We'll have plenty of chances in the coming weeks to measure pre-election polls against actual results ‚Äì including in states with much more racial diversity than New Hampshire. The only prediction I'll make is that following Tuesday's big surprise, embarrassed pollsters and pundits will be especially vigilant for any sign that the 'Bradley effect,' unseen in recent years, might have crept back.\\" An inspection of the discrepancy between pre-election polls and Obama's ultimate support reveals significant bivariate support for the hypothesized \\"reverse Bradley effect\\". On average, Obama received three percentage points more support in the primaries and caucuses than he did during polling; however, he also had a strong ground campaign, and many polls do not question voters with only cell phones, who are predominantly young.Blumenthal, Mark. (July 3, 2007). \\"Cell Phones and Political Surveys: Part 1 \\", Pollster.com Obama went on to win the election with 53% of the popular vote and a large electoral college victory. Following the 2008 presidential election, a number of news sources reported that the result confirmed the absence of a 'Bradley Effect' in view of the close correlation between the pre-election polls and the actual share of the popular vote. However, it has been suggested that such assumptions based on the overall share of the vote are too simplistic because they ignore the fact that underlying factors can be contradictory and hence masked in overall voting figures. For instance, it has been suggested that an extant Bradley Effect was masked by the unusually high turnout amongst African Americans and other Democratic leaning voter groups under the unique circumstances of the 2008 election (i.e. the first serious bid for President by an African-American candidate). 2016 United States presidential election Although race was not a factor in the 2016 United States presidential election because both candidates were white, a similar observation occurred in the 2016 elections in that the polls did not accurately predict the ultimate election outcome. According to major opinion polling, former United States Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was predicted to defeat businessman Donald Trump. Nevertheless, Trump won the key Rust Belt states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, giving him more electoral votes than Secretary Clinton. Post-election analysis of public opinion polling showed that Trump's base was larger than predicted, leading some experts to suggest that some \\"shy Trumpers\\" were hiding their preferences to avoid being seen as prejudiced by pollsters. There may have been also some cases in which male respondents were hiding their preferences to avoid being seen as sexist, as Hillary Clinton was the first female major party candidate for President. In a 2019 press conference, Trump estimated the effect to be between 6 and 10% in his favor. He described this effect as \\"I don‚Äôt know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment.\\" However many pollsters have disputed this claim. A 2016 poll conducted by Morning Consult showed that Trump performed better in general election polls regardless of whether the poll was conducted online or by live interviewer over the phone.

Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts reports that he was born on March 1, 1961, in Zletan, Saudi Arabia. Personal life According to historian Andy Worthington, the author of The Guantanamo Files, Gherebi had settled in Pakistan after fleeing Muammar Gaddafi's repressive regime in Libya. He was married to a Pakistani woman, and had fathered several children, the youngest of whom is fifteen, and who he has never met. He had worked as a teacher, teaching science at a primary school. Official status reviews Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. Habeas corpus Salem was the first Guantanamo captive to challenge whether he should have access to US Civil Courts. Human rights lawyer Stephen Yagman filed the appeal on Salem's behalf after being contacted by Salem's brother Justice Matz ruled against Salim, but Matz's ruling was overturned on appeal, by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, on December 18, 2003. On February 20, 2007, two of the three judges on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that when the Military Commissions Act stripped the right to use habeas corpus from the Guantanamo captives retroactively, and that appeals, like Salem's, which were in process, were vacated.

She is one of the few female helicopter pilots/on-camera reporters in Los Angeles television history.  Career  Horton began to fly at age 19, shortly after graduation from North Hollywood High School in North Hollywood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. She worked two jobs (at a car dealership and a pharmacy) for two and a half years to pay for her training. She explained, \\"I could only afford to take lessons once a week or once every other week as I made the money to pay for them.\\" She also washed local pilot/reporter Scott Reiff's helicopter in exchange for flying hours. At one point, Horton was a stuntwoman, riding horses for films. She earned her pilot's license at 21, and since then has flown traffic watch, tours, frost control, charter, wildland firefighting, police operations, aerial construction, bank runs, medical and organ transport. She has also ferried helicopters across the U. S. From 2001 to 2005, Horton flew and reported for KABC 7 in Los Angeles. She was with KTLA 5 in Los Angeles from April 2005 to October 2005, flying their helicopter and reporting traffic and breaking news for the KTLA Morning News. Los Angeles magazine says, \\"The most memorable and unfortunate event Horton ever covered was in 2002, when five-year-old Samantha Runnion was kidnapped from her home in Stanton [California] and murdered. 'I hate to bring this up, but I was the first one on the scene when they discovered her body in the mountains. The police hadn't covered her up yet, and with my 1,000-millimeter zoom lens I could see everything.'\\" Los Angeles magazine's claim is debatable since on October 29, 2006, while flying for KNBC 4, Horton had to report the deaths of four of her fellow United States Forest Service firefighters (a fifth would later succumb to his injuries) in the arson-caused Esperanza Fire. The next day, Horton herself would be fighting that fire from the air. Horton now divides her time among several jobs: In the summer, she fights fires by helicopter for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the U. S. Forest Service. Only about twenty women are certified by the USFS to do this. Horton derives great satisfaction from fighting fires because she's saving people's property and maybe even their lives. She says it also provides an additional enjoyment that comes from making full use of a chopper's unique capabilities. She was featured in the August 2007 issue of Wildland Firefighter magazine, in an article detailing her flying career. In the winter, she reports breaking news in the evening and at night for KCBS 2 and KCAL 9 in Los Angeles. She has also flown a helicopter for the city of Corona, California Police Department. Horton, who is on the board of directors of the Professional Helicopter Pilots Association (PHPA), has over 7,400 hours (August 2008) in rotorcraft and says her dream is to work for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. She has been featured in articles in Private Pilot, Air Beat, Pilot Magazine, Pacific Flyer, and the LA 411 directory. With regard to Horton, LA 411 said: \\"A young woman with a breezy nature, youthful looks and bright smile, it's often assumed [on a movie set] that she can't possibly be there to fly an aircraft. In fact, she's been yelled at for simply going near the helicopter.\\" Horton says, \\"I've even been told sometimes when they see me walking toward the helicopter, ‚ÄòHey girl get away from the helicopter!'\\" The May 1, 2009 edition of the Smithsonian Institution's publication Air & Space/Smithsonian identifies Horton as \\"a specialized breed of aviator [that] has evolved, one adapted to the medium of live television\\" since the invention of the Telecopter. She has also appeared as a model in both the Harley-Davidson motorcycle catalog and the Harley- Davidson clothing catalog. Horton and her helicopter have appeared on camera in several films including American Icarus (2002), Showtime (2002), and One Six Right (2005). Horton has also worked on a number of motion pictures where the helicopter served as an aerial camera platform. She is one of just a handful of female SAG/AFTRA chopper pilots. In 2008, Horton was set to star in her own television series Sky Racers on truTV (formerly Court TV). The show, which never left the development stage, was to put viewers inside the cockpit with Horton covering breaking news in the Los Angeles area. In August 2008, Horton was flying and filming scenes in Maui, Hawaii for another truTV show, Maui Chopper, to debut on December 10, 2008. In March 2010, Horton represented Heli-Barbie in a commercial made for Mattel, Inc.'s Barbie doll. In November 2011, she was studying to get her license as an emergency medical technician (EMT). As of 2012, Desiree splits her time between flying news in Los Angeles for KCAL/KCBS as a pilot/reporter and working her second season on an exclusive use fire contract as a highly trained rappel pilot in Region 6 in Oregon flying a Bell 205A1++. Horton has her own company, Horizon Helicopters, Inc., in Studio City, California, for production jobs. Popularity with viewers When KTLA replaced Horton late in 2005, popular media-tracking weblog Innocent Bystander said it subsequently received so many \\"hits\\" from people searching the Internet for Horton that it had to post an online warning saying it might be forced to shut down for a few days. This had never happened before. Due to KTLA's distribution via satellite as a \\"superstation,\\" viewers from as far as Canada wrote to complain that Horton was no longer on the Morning News. Horton maintains a blog, The Adventures of Chopper Chick!, so her fans can keep up with her activities and ask her questions. She set up the blog after learning there were so many people asking about her on the Internet. \\"I didn't realize how many fans I had and how many people cared [about me] until I was gone [from KTLA],\\" she said. Personal life Horton, who is single, was born and raised in North Hollywood, California. She is very close to her mom. Her KTLA bio stated: \\"One of the most cherished people in her life is her mother.\\" ReferencesSources (use ctrl-f to search for Fighting Fire) * External links  * 1971 births Aerial firefighting American television personalities Living people People from Chatsworth, Los Angeles United States Forest Service officials Helicopter pilots American female aviators ","title":"Desiree Horton"},{"id":"9643323","text":"was a river gunboat of the Imperial Japanese Navy, part of the 11th Gunboat Sentai, that operated on the Yangtze River in China during the 1920s, and during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. Background Seta was the lead vessel of the river gunboats built under the 1920 Fleet Building Program of the Imperial Japanese Navy for operations on the inland waterways of China.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy; page 120 Design The basic design of Seta was modeled after that of the gunboat , with the same general dimensions and layout. Seta had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 338 tons and draft of . She was propelled by two reciprocating engines with two Kampon boilers driving three shafts, producing and had a top speed of 16 knots. The ship was initially armed with two /28 cal. guns and six 7.7mm machine guns. Service record Seta was laid down on 29 April 1922 and launched 30 June 1922 at the Harima Shipyards at Aioi, Hyogo, Japan. As the design was incapable of open ocean sailing, she was then broken down into sections and shipped to the Tunghwa Shipyard in Shanghai, where she was reassembled and completed on 20 October 1923. She was assigned to patrols of the Yangtze River from Shanghai to the Three Gorges, for commerce protection and as a show of force in protection of Japanese nationals and economic interests through the rest of the 1920s and early 1930s. From February 1932, she was assigned to the First China Expeditionary Fleet. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Seta was based in Changsha, and was used to evacuate Japanese residents from the interior of China. During the Battle of Shanghai, Seta landed reinforcements of the Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF), and bombarded Chinese positions at Shanghai on 13 August 1937. She also helped assist in the evacuation of 20,000 of Shanghai‚Äôs 30,000 Japanese civilian residents, and covered the landings of the Imperial Japanese Army‚Äôs 3rd Division, 8th Division and 11th Divisions north of Shanghai. On 26 June 1938, Seta, and with the gunboats and and minelayers , , and participated in the Battle of Madang and subsequent Battle of Jiujiang, bombarding Chinese positions and sweeping for mines in the Yangtze River. Many exposed crewmen are wounded or killed by Chinese light arms fire before the SNLF can capture the Madang Forts. Around 1940, Seta was refitted with two 3.1-in/40 cal anti-aircraft guns and five 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns. From 4 November 1941, she was based in Hankou, cooperating with Imperial Japanese Army units in mopping up operations. On 22 June 1942, she participated in ‚ÄúOperation SE‚Äù and was assigned to the Tung Ting Lake task force with gunboats and . On 25 November, five crewmen were killed when Seta was strafed by fighters from the USAAF Fourteenth Air Force . Around the end of 1943, her anti-aircraft weaponry was further upgraded with the replacement of the five Hotchkiss machine guns with six Type 96 AA guns. On 6 June 1943, seven USAAF P-40 Warhawk fighters strafed Seta near Shansi, killing 14 crewmen, including her captain, Commander Hisashi Matsumoto and wounding 14 more. She was repaired at the Kiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai by the end of July. She was reassigned back to Hangkow for patrols of the upper Yangtze River, and was attacked again on 1 September 1943, 22 May 1944, and 11 June 1944 without taking any damage. However, an attack on 17 August wrecked her stern and rudder, and she had to be towed to Shanghai for repairs. Repairs were completed on 24 October; however two days later she was bombed again and sank. Her armaments were salvaged to help bolster the land-based defenses of Shanghai, and she was removed from the navy list on 30 September 1945. The wreck was raised after the end of the war and after repairs was commissioned into the Republic of China Navy as the Chang Teh (). She was then captured together with Toba by the People‚Äôs Republic of China in the Chinese Civil War and commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy on 30 November 1949 as the gunboat Min Jiang (). She was finally scrapped in the 1960s.

It is found from the southern United States, through Central America to Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The wingspan is 60 mm. Adults are on wing year round in the tropics, southern Florida and Louisiana. They are on wing from August to November in the northern part of the range. The larvae probably feed on Caribbean grape (Vitis tiliifolia) and other Vitaceae and Dilleniaceae species, such as Vitis, Cissus rhombifolia and Ampelopsis, Tetracera volubilis, Curatella americana, Tetracera hydrophila and Doliocarpus multiflorus. Ludwigia of the family Onagraceae might also be a host plant. Males of the Enyo ocypete exhibit a smaller wing size than females. The many reproductive flight advantages include the ability of males to fly faster and have better fitness for mating, while females possess slower flight which is used for selecting host plants and gathering resources.

Background Toba was intended as a replacement for the British-built river gunboats and for operations on the inland waterways of China under the 1910 fiscal year budget.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy; page 120 . Toba was laid down at Sasebo Naval Arsenal on 7 July 1911, launched on 7 November 1911 and entered service on 17 November 1911.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Design The basic design of Toba was modeled after her British built predecessors, but with slightly larger dimensions and much more powerful engines. Toba had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 250 tons and draft of . She was propelled by two reciprocating engines with two Kampon boilers driving three shafts, producing and had a top speed of 15 knots.Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 249 The ship was initially armed with two /28 cal. guns and six 6.6mm machine guns. Service record The Xinhai Revolution in China occurred during 1911, and Toba was dispatched to mainland China immediately on completion, together with the cruiser and assigned to the China Area Fleet. As Toba was incapable of open ocean sailing, she was transported in a floating dry dock to Shanghai. She was assigned to patrols of the Yangtze River from Shanghai to the Three Gorges, for commerce protection and as a show of force in protection of Japanese nationals and economic interests. During World War I, due to the official neutrality of the Republic of China, Toba's weaponry was placed under lock in 1914, and was not freed until China officially joined the Allies. Toba was reassigned to the Japanese First Fleet in 1919 and to the Japanese Third Fleet in 1933. She was returned to Kure Naval Arsenal from April to June 1937 for modernization and upgrades to her weaponry. These changes resulted in an increase in beam from 8.99 to 9.78 meters. She was rearmed with one 12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval gun, dual 76 mm/40 guns, dual 7.7 mm machine guns; and dual 76 mm/40 anti-aircraft guns, and two dual machine guns and one depth charge thrower . With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, Toba was recalled to Shanghai from her base in Yichang, Hubei Province to assist in the evacuation of 20,000 of Shanghai‚Äôs 30,000 Japanese civilian residents during the Battle of Shanghai . During the Battle of Madang on 26 June 1938, Toba assisted the minelayers , and in bombarding Chinese positions and in minesweeping operations. With the start of World War II on 8 December 1941, Toba assisted in the sinking of the Royal Navy gunboat and the capture of the US Navy gunboat . She continued to make patrols on the lower reaches of the Yangzi River from 1942 through 1945, with service and overhaul at increasingly frequent intervals at the Kiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. Abandoned by Japanese forces in Shanghai at the surrender of Japan in September 1945, she was captured by the Republic of China and incorporated into the Chinese Navy as the gunboat Yong Ji (Ê∞∏Êµé). After a successful fight against communists in the town of Haoxue (ÈÉùÁ©¥) in Jiangling County, the ship was renamed after the town on 17 April 1948. She was then captured by the People‚Äôs Republic of China in the Chinese Civil War and commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy on 29 November 1949 as the gunboat Xiang Jiang (ÊπòÊ±ü). She continued to be used until scrapped in the 1960s.

History  Mawlamyine (Moulmein) Airport was initially established in 1941. During World War II, it was a Royal Air Force field. It was used not only by the British but also by the Flying Tigers, an American volunteer pilot group then. On 20 January 1942, as a major air operation in Southeast Asia, the 62nd Sentai Heavy Bombers escorted by the 50th Sentai of Imperial Japanese Army Air Service attacked the airfield and its satellite at Mudon with a total of 65 planes. On 28 February 1942, Japanese General Obata visited the airfield and it was reconstructed with 450 Japanese construction crews to be used as Air Force headquarters for attacking British airfield at Mingaladon. After Burma's independence in 1948, the Union of Burma Airways (UBA) was founded and started its domestic services to local airports including Mawlamyine (Moulmein) Airport. On 14 March 1949, a De Havilland DH.104 Dove 1 of the Union of Burma Airways, registration XY-ABO, crashed in Gulf of Mottama (Martaban) en route from Mingaladon Airport to Mawlamyine (Moulmein) Airport. Nine passengers and two crew (Captain P.H. Sparrow, pilot, and L.A. Stephens, radio officer) were lost. It was probably the first ever civilian plane crash in Burma's aviation history. In September 2013, Nok Air Mini started flights between the Thai border town Mae Sot and Mawlamyine. This was the first time the airport handled international flights after 1948. However, Nok Air Mini stopped its service due to the poor condition of the runway and facilities.  Modernisation  The Mawlamyine Airport's runway is being upgraded in the 2018 budget year.

Background and construction The Imperial Japanese Navy budget for Fiscal 1927 include a small minelayer for coastal and river service to complement its larger minelayers, the former cruisers , and . Yaeyama was launched by the Kure Naval Arsenal in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan on 15 October 1931, and was commissioned into service on 31 August 1932. Operational history On completion, Yaeyama was assigned to the Sasebo Naval District. In August 1937, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Yaeyama was assigned as flagship for Admiral Tanimoto‚Äôs 11th Gunboat Division, at Shanghai and was responsible for patrols on the Yangzi River. Yaeyama covered the landing of Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) reinforcements in the Battle of Shanghai, and participated in the evacuation of 20,000 Japanese civilians and non- combatants from the city back to Japan. She was then placed on the reserve list on 1 December 1937.

The Exposition Auditorium was located south of the University of Pennsylvania, and the later Convention Hall was constructed along the building's east wall. It was demolished in 2006. Each state was allotted two delegates per electoral vote, and territories were granted from two to six delegates. Altogether, there were 926 delegates and an equal number of alternates. Mark Hanna opened the convention. He proposed that Senator Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado serve as temporary chairman. The purpose of Wolcott's selection was to show that the party had overcome its divisiveness of 1896, in which the Colorado delegation walked out of the Republican convention. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts served as the convention's permanent chairman. President William McKinley was unanimously nominated for reelection. No candidate ran against him, although Admiral George Dewey considered a run. Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York, who was himself a delegate, was nominated for vice president by a vote of 925 to 1 abstention, with his vote alone abstaining. State delegates The 1900 Republican National Convention included a historic first for the Republican Party: Jennie L. McCargar Jones of Salt Lake City, Utah, and Susan Henderson West of Lewiston, Idaho, served as alternate delegates. Speakers The 1900 convention had fewer speakers than a modern convention typically has due to lack of TV and even radio at this time. There were however the following speakers: June 19 *Prayer by Rev. James Gray Bolton D.D. *Mark Hanna *Edward O. Wolcott June 20 *Prayer by Rev. Charles M. Boswell D.D. *Henry Cabot Lodge June 21 *Prayer by Most Rev. P.J. Ryan, Archbishop of Philadelphia *Joseph B. Foraker, U.S. Senator from Ohio, McKinley nominating speech *Theodore Roosevelt, Governor of New York and McKinley seconding speech Balloting: President McKinley was nominated unanimously. This was the first time this happened since President Grant was nominated in 1872. *John W. Yerkes, IRS Commissioner from Kentucky *George A. Knight, Attorney and Businessman from California *James A. Mount, Governor of Indiana Wanting to get rid of him, Boss Platt, convinced New York governor Theodore Roosevelt, hero of the hour, to allow himself to be nominated for Vice President. *Lafayette Young, Newspaper reporter from Iowa, Roosevelt nominating speech *M.J. Murray, local politician from Massachusetts, Roosevelt seconding speech *General James M. Ashton, lawyer and soldier from Washington, Roosevelt seconding speech Balloting: Governor Roosevelt was the sole delegate to refuse to vote for his nomination for Vice President. *Chauncey Depew Vice Presidential nomination Vice President Garret Hobart had announced in September 1899 that he would not seek re-election, and subsequently died in office on November 21, leaving the party the task of choosing a new running mate. Entering the convention, many had expected that the ticket would consist of President McKinley and New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt. However, Ohio Senator Mark Hanna maneuvered to keep Roosevelt off the ballot, instead proposing Navy Secretary John D. Long of Massachusetts or Iowa Representative Jonathan P. Dolliver. Without the support of McKinley, Hanna's efforts fell short. Roosevelt himself did not particularly want to abandon his position of governor, but he desired to run for president in 1904 and when the party nominated him, he accepted the position. Roosevelt's nomination was spearheaded by bosses Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and Thomas C. Platt of New York, the latter of whom wished to find a different job for the reformist Roosevelt.

If extirpated, coastal, introduced, and accidental species are included these numbers increase to 8 orders, 26 families, 67 genera, and 105 species. The region includes the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The makeup and distribution of the mammals in New England are largely the result of the Last Glacial Maximum when the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered virtually the entire region. Recolonization of the area appears to have occurred from one or a few southern glacial refugia. This is in contrast to the multiple glacial refugia present throughout the American West (Stone and Cook, 2000). As a consequence of both the recent uninhabitability and the few sources of recolonization, species diversity for some taxa in parts of New England are lower than in similar areas in other parts of North America. Chipmunks and ground squirrels are exemplars of this situation. New England has one species of each, but numerous locations west of the Rocky Mountains host several species (Hall, 1981). Habitat varies throughout the region. Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, in the north of the region, have a humid continental short summer climate, with cooler summers and long, cold winters. Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, in the south, have a humid continental long summer climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The average rainfall for most of the region is from 1,000 to 1,500 mm (40 to 60 in) a year, although the northern parts of Vermont and Maine see slightly less, from 500 to 1,000 mm (20 to 40 in). Snowfall can often exceed 2,500 mm (100 in) annually (New England Climate Initiative, 2006). Most mammals in this region exhibit specializations for dealing with the sometimes harsh winter conditions. A comprehensive listing of all species found in the region follows.

Awarded the Order of Canada in 1972 for her work with the Girl Guides of Canada and St. John Ambulance as well as for her mountaineering career. Phyllis' Engine, a prominent rock spire in the Pacific Ranges near Mount Garibaldi, was despite claims to the contrary named for Phyllis Beltzhttps://bivouac.com//MtnPg.asp?MtnId=611. Mount Munday is named after Don and Phyllis Munday, and Baby Munday Peak is named for their daughter Edith Early life Phyllis was born in Sri Lanka, moved to the British Columbia interior in 1901, and then to Vancouver in 1907. In 1912 she climbed Grouse Mountain with her Girl Guide company. In 1915, at 21, Phyllis joined the British Columbia Mountaineering Club and began going on club trips to such places as Mount Seymour, The Lions, Mount Tantalus and Mount Garibaldi. Meeting Don Phyllis met her future husband in 1918. While on a mountaineering trip an incident occurred which, in Don's words, \\"lends itself readily to being given a romantic aspect.\\"Munday p 1 Don lost his footing on a glacial moraine, and was in danger of slipping into a crevasse. Phyllis jumped to help him restore his balance, and in so doing lost hers. Don managed to grab and steady her until she could regain her feet. They married in February 1920, spending their honeymoon in a cabin on Dam Mountain near Vancouver. Their daughter, Edith was born in 1921, and at 11 weeks she was carried to the top of Crown Mountain. From 1923 to 1926 the Mundays lived in a tent, and then a cabin on Grouse Mountain where Don worked cutting a trail from Lonsdale Avenue in North Vancouver, British Columbia to the summit, while Phyllis ran the Alpine Lodge, serving hot drinks and meals to hikers. Exploration of the Waddington Range In 1925, while on a trip to Mount Arrowsmith, Vancouver Island, Don and Phyllis Munday spotted what they believed to be a peak taller than Mount Robson, the then accepted tallest peak entirely within British Columbia. In the words of Don Munday \\"The compass showed the alluring peak stood along a line passing a little east of Bute Inlet and perhaps 150 miles away, where blank spaces on the map left ample room for many nameless mountains.\\"Munday p4 While there is some debate as to whether the peak they saw was indeed Mount Waddington (in fact, Don Munday himself observed that the feat is impossibleFairley p 59), they almost certainly saw a peak in the Waddington Range, and this led the Mundays to explore that area, and discover the mountain in fact. Over the next decade, the Munday's mounted several expeditions into the area in an attempt to climb it. Known to them as \\"The Mystery Mountain\\", in 1927 the height was measured at 13,260 feet (by triangulation),Munday p.124 and the Canadian Geographic Board gave it the name Mount Waddington after Alfred Waddington who was a proponent of a railway through the Homathko River valley. They reached the lower summit in 1928, deeming the main summit too risky.

His father was in the wholesale flour and grain business, purchasing the output of several mills and selling under his own brand name. Biography One of the best known figures in Canada's clay brick industry, McFarren began his career on May 23, 1904 in Corticelli's silk firm tying up parcels. Staying with Corticelli's for 3 years he then went on the road for Mussen's construction equipment. Then in 1912 became a purchasing agent for McKenzie, Mann and Company working on the Mount Royal tunnel in Montreal. In 1914 McFarren was approached by a syndicate that had the idea of starting a brick company. He then began to build the old Interprovincial Brick Company in Cheltenham on March 1, 1914. Five months later the first brick came out of the kiln, a record in those days. McFarren operated the Interprovincial Brick Company for 14 years, commencing in 1914, with the exception of part of 1915 and all of 1916 which was spent in the Canadian military service as a junior officer with the 3rd. Battalion, C.E.F., at Ypres, and the 1st. Canadian Trench Mortar Battery on the Somme. He was invalided home from the military after Christmas of 1916, and while in and out of hospital, resumed management of the company.Brick and Clay Record, v.54: (1919) p.897 (free full text at Google Book Search) In 1928, control of his brick company was acquired by Cooksville Brick. Later in 1954 it came into the hands of E.P. Taylor interests and then became part of the Domtar chain, but McFarren remained in management until at least 1955, when he oversaw the conversion of his plant from coal fuel to natural gas. .\\"Brick Plant Turns on Gas\\"The Financial PostNov 19, 1955 In April 1929 McFarren purchased the Streetsville brick plant, renaming to McFarren Brick, just prior to the Great Depression. With times difficult and a drop in demand for bricks of about 90% by 1932. McFarren constructed an entirely new plant. At the time was modern and efficient and kept up to date. It replaced to a large extent human muscle with automatic machinery. F. B. McFarren Memorial Park in Streetsville is named after him.

Overview In 2000, Hirasawa switched from a gasoline-powered car to a hybrid electric, developing an interest in sustainable energy, specifically in the idea of using solar power to make music. He purchased two 120-watt solar panels, outfitted his home studio to be powered by them, and connected two car batteries to store additional energy, which combined allowed Hirasawa to work for 12 hours. To further optimize the work hours and prepare for bad weather days, only equipment necessary for work was ever kept on. The studio was illuminated by less than 30 small low wattage blue LEDs. Hirasawa's workdays ended when there was no more energy remaining. In total, less than 7 kg of carbon dioxide were emitted during the making of the album. Solar Ray features remixes of songs from previous albums in the energetic technopop style of Hirasawa's former band, P-Model.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. History Dakota was introduced in 1990 and was mainly marketed towards 18 to 24 year old blue-collar \\"virile females\\" with no education beyond high school, held entry-level service or factory jobs, had no career prospects, and had a high probability of being unemployed or employed only part time, who wear casual clothes (e.g., jeans, knit tops, sweaters, shorts, warm-up suits, and sweatshirts and sweatpants) and wore little makeup, their taste in television programs included evening soap operas and situation comedies with working-class heroines, such as Roseanne, and their music tastes centered on all-male, classic rock bands, in an attempt to displace the Marlboro brand, without diluting Reynolds' dominant Camel brand's appeal to males. According to the promotional plan, the virile female spent her free time with her boyfriend, \\"doing whatever he is doing\\", aspired to getting married in her early twenties and having a family. She and her friends pursued interests such as \\"cruising\\", partying, listening to classic rock and roll, attending various motor sports (e.g., drag races, Hot rod shows, tractor pulls, and motorcycle races), playing softball and bowling, watching wrestling and \\"Tough Man\\" competitions, and attending fairs and carnivals. These characteristics were described as \\"hot buttons\\" for appealing to the virile female and her friends. Forty package backgrounds and 40 names for the new brand were tested in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Several variations in packaging and product were considered, including a slide box, a foil inner seal, a wider cigarette, and a slower burning cigarette with a higher puff count. Research explored the packaging colors blue, brown, and burgundy. The women in the focus group preferred burgundy, rating the color as \\"unique/different, attractive, friends would carry, high quality, modern/contemporary\\". Consumers in Atlanta were the test group for 120 ad concepts for the new brand of cigarettes, and evaluations by consumers in Baltimore, Maryland, were subsequently used to refine 50 ad concepts. The selected set of advertising images was tested with five focus groups of Marlboro smokers in Chicago, Illinois, who were 18 through 20 years old. After test-marketing in Houston, Tucson, Phoenix, and Nashville, the brand didn't yield the desired results and was eventually withdrawn. Controversy=Dakota and targeting towards \\"virile women\\" In February 1990, details of the marketing campaign of the Dakota brand were leaked to the Washington Post and revealed that the cigarettes were narrowly targeted at a demographic described as \\"virile females\\". Despite the denial of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to have specifically targeted young females, this revelation sparked widespread discussion of targeted advertising in general in the media. Advertising In the 1990s, R.J. Reynolds made various poster adverts to promote the Dakota brand. The slogan that was used was \\"Dakota. Where smooth comes easy.\\" The tested ads seemed successful in conveying the desired imagery of \\"independent yet approachable, sociable yet also enjoying her own company, feeling equal to men yet enjoying a warm fun relationship with a man\\" without alienating younger males. Negative reactions to the tested ads occurred either among women with \\"traditional values\\" who did not aspire to the \\"Dakota woman's independence, assertiveness and control\\" or among the \\"more conservative/introverted respondents [who] may have felt somewhat threatened by the strong personalities conveyed\\". Several slogans using \\"smooth\\" were tested, including \\"Smooth. Streetwise\\", \\"Smooth revolution\\" and \\"Smooth action. Slow burn\\". \\"Where smooth comes easy\\" was preferred for its consistency with the \\"attitude/personality\\" of the Dakota woman. Marketing choices emphasized point-of-sale merchandising and materials usable in promotional venues, such as bars. Promotional items considered were door decals, in/out stickers, floormats, change cups, banners, neon signs, counter mats, 3-D (three-dimensional) motion signs, clocks', gas pump toppers, and store hour signs. Promotional activities for the Dakota brand were intended to be \\"tightly targeted [and] extremely impactful and [to use] innovative communication techniques\\". Many promotional concepts were developed, corresponding to the many hot buttons and interests of the targeted women. One proposal was a \\"Night of the Living Hunks\\" contest, for which the prize was a date with a male stripper. The targeted women's interest in romance suggested a soap opera trivia contest and free copies of a customized Dakota romance novel in exchange for redeemable one-pack coupons. Other ideas included limousine parties, vouchers for car shows, and parties in large parking lots where participants could pose against a Dakota backdrop while a camera generated postersized pictures. \\"Party packages\\" custom designed for women's \\"hot spots\\" (e.g., bowling alleys, bars, apartments, and company picnics) were also proposed. Packages would include decorations, games, prizes, supplies, and samples of Dakota cigarettes. Detailed tactical plans and budgets were developed for several promotions related to the targeted women's inclination to patronize bars with rock and roll music. Participating bars and clubs would receive a video jukebox featuring the Dakota colors and logo. An all-male rock band would be named Dakota and perform at local clubs surrounded by a large Dakota banner. The band's clothing, stage materials, and limousine all would bear the Dakota logo. Women in the audience could receive, in a special Dakota folder, instant photographs of themselves with the band. Cassettes of the Dakota band would be handed out with a sweepstakes form to collect names for a direct-mail list; winners would have pictures taken with the band, would be given clothing with the Dakota logo, and would be \\"official Dakota Groupies for a night\\". Auditions would be held for a girl singer to perform as guest artist; posters in clubs, newspaper ads, and direct mail would publicize this competition. Dakota would conduct screen tests for five finalists to appear in a \\"feature role\\" in a music video of the band. Registration, which would be conducted in clubs, required that another person, such as a friend, sign up screen test participants so that both names could be captured for mailing lists. A \\"Rock Until You Drop\\" event was to be publicized by a local radio station and hosted by its disc jockey. Two stages would allow for continuous music, and Dakota samples would be distributed during the event. Before this mega Battle of the Bands event, Dakota parties in nightclubs would award free tickets, limousines, and drinks to selected entrants. All entries would provide names and addresses for the mailing list. Implementation in test markets called for weekly distribution of 500 T-shirts, 30 jackets, 1,000 Polaroid photographs and folders, 250 cassettes, 200 sweepstakes forms, and 250 posters to support the planned events. Implementation also called for neon bar signs, as well as Dakota logos on napkins, coasters, stirrers, table tents, ashtrays, and mirrors. The total development costs were considerable. Even six months before the scheduled Spring 1990 test marketing and before costs were incurred for ads or promotions, the cost of the project had exceeded $1.4 million. In addition, the campaign may have had some public relations costs for the industry. A sizable advocacy campaign was mounted to highlight the targeting and promotion efforts (USDHHS 2000). The effect of the advocacy effort is unclear, but the Dakota brand ultimately had little market impact, and it was withdrawn. The campaign illustrated that psychological subtleties and knowledge of lifestyle patterns were used to define women precisely and that risks from positioning the brand narrowly existed, in that it may have resulted in disinterest among consumers outside this narrow lifestyle segment.

It was released in March and August 1975 in the US and the UK respectively. It was the first Hendrix album to be produced by Alan Douglas. Background Before Hendrix died in 1970, he was in the final stages of preparing what he intended to be a double studio LP, which was given various titles such as 'First Rays of the New Rising Sun', 'People, Hell & Angels', and 'Strate Ahead' [sic]. Most of the tracks intended for this album were spread out over three posthumous single LP releases: The Cry of Love (1971), Rainbow Bridge (1971), and War Heroes (1972). In the case of the last two of these LPs, a demo track, a live track, and unreleased studio tracks were used to fill out the releases. In late 1973, his international label prepared to issue an LP titled Loose Ends which contained eight tracks, six of which were generally regarded as incomplete or substandard (the only two \\"finished\\" tracks on this release were \\"The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\\", a heavily re-mixed stereo version of the B-side which had been released in the original mono mix on the 1968 European and Japanese versions of the Smash Hits, and a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Drifter's Escape\\", both of which would ultimately be re-released on the South Saturn Delta CD in 1997). Loose Ends was not released in the USA by Reprise because they considered the quality of the tracks to be subpar. Hendrix had amassed a great deal of time in the studio in 1969 and 1970, resulting in a substantial number of songs, some close to completion, that were available for potential release. After the death of Hendrix' manager in 1973, Alan Douglas was hired to evaluate hundreds of hours of remaining material that was not used on earlier posthumous albums. \\"Peace in Mississippi,\\" \\"Somewhere,\\" and \\"Stone Free\\" were recorded with the original Jimi Hendrix Experience line up, while the rest of the material used on Crash Landing consisted of recordings Hendrix originally made with Billy Cox on bass and either Mitch Mitchell or Buddy Miles on drums and on one occasion by Rocky Isaacs. Controversy Crash Landing was the first release produced by Douglas, and immediately caused controversy. The liner notes of the album indicated that Douglas used several session musicians, none of whom had ever even met Hendrix, to re-record or overdub guitar, bass, drums, and percussion on the album, erasing the contributions of the original musicians and changing the feel of the songs (Hendrix' vocals and guitar contributions were retained). This was evidently done to give a finish to songs that were works in progress or may have been recorded as demos. Douglas also added female backing vocals to the title track. The album peaked at numbers five in the US and 35 in the UK, the highest chart positions since The Cry of Love.

Salmon completed nearly 1,000 paintings, all save one of maritime scenes or seascapes. He is widely considered the Father of American Luminism. Early life in England Salmon was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, England in October or November, 1775 as Robert Salomon; he was christened on 5 November 1775 in Whitehaven. His father, Francis Salomon, was a jeweler. The young Salmon clearly studied the work of Dutch marine painters of the 17th century, the Italian painters of vedute, and the work of Claude Lorrain, but little else is known of his early training. His earliest known works, Two Armed Merchantmen Leaving Whitehaven Harbor and The ‚ÄòEstridge‚Äô Off Dover are dated 1800; the first work he exhibited at the Royal Academy was in 1802. Salmon settled in the busy seaport of Liverpool in 1806 and changed his name from Salomon to Salmon. Many of his marine paintings from this early period survive, and are housed in the National Maritime Museum in London. His ship portraits indicate he had a familiarity with sailing ships and an intimate knowledge of how they worked. These portraits tend to follow his traditional practice of showing the same vessel in at least two positions on the same canvas. In April, 1811 he moved from the Liverpool area to Greenock, Scotland and then back to Liverpool in October 1822. In 1826 he returned to Greenock, then he left for London in 1827, and shortly thereafter he went to Southampton, North Shields and Liverpool. Along with many other young artists, Salmon believed that his artistic future lay in the United States. Before his departure in 1828, the artist executed his only extant portrait, Portrait of the Corsair, John Paul Jones, a work very much a part of the Romantic ethos of his time. He assumed his \\"likeness\\" of Paul Jones would form a bond with the viewers in his future home. He could not know, having never been to America, that the memory of America's greatest naval hero had effectively vanished in the public mind before the painting was completed. Emigration to America and life in Boston Wharves of Boston, 1829 In 1828, Salmon left Europe for the United States on the packet ship, \\"New York\\", arriving on New Years Day, 1829 and staying until 1840. Living in a small hut on Marine Railway Wharf overlooking Boston Harbor, Salmon prospered as a marine painter, accepting commissions to paint ship portraits. During the growth of Boston Harbor in the first half of the century, Salmon painted between 300-400 paintings of the Harbor, in the style of 17th century Dutch genre painting. He was thought to be an eccentric, solitary and irascible man. Salmon soon became one of the most prominent Boston seascape painters. During the ensuing years, he divided his time between painting and working in the lithographic studio of William S. Pendleton, where he encountered William Bradford and Fitz Henry Lane. This contact between Lane and Salmon was of great importance to Lane, and became evident in his marine views. During his lifetime, Salmon's work was very popular, and was collected by Bostonians Samuel Cabot, Robert Bennett Forbes, and John Newmarch Cushing. Later years Salmon left Boston in 1842 and for many years was believed to have died shortly after his leaving there. Instead, he returned to Europe and went to Italy. A number of Italian views attributed to him have survived, the latest of which is dated 1845, the year of his last documented work. The actual date of his death remains uncertain. Robert Salmon's works can be found at the U.S. Naval Academy; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; National Maritime Museum, Greenwich; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; New Britain Museum of American Art, Connecticut; Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut; Mariners Museum, Newport News, Virginia; William A. Farnsworth Art Museum, Rockland, Maine; Peabody Essex Museum of Salem; Shelburne Museum, Vermont; and the Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts.

Stewart in fact died on 10 April, and with the support of Governor Ch√¢tellerault, Gordon was provided to the see on 17 May, receiving consecration in either late December 1545 or early January of the following year.Macfarlane, \\"Gordon, William (d. 1577)\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 4. In the first few years of his episcopate, Gordon made a determined, unsuccessful effort to stamp out the growth of Presbyterianism. In 1549 the Scottish provincial council convened to reform the Scottish church. Bishop Gordon was, arguably, part of the problem, as he had fathered eight children by an unmarried woman named Janet Knowles whom he supported with episcopal revenues. In 1560 the Scottish Church broke its ties to Rome, banned Mass and established an independent Scottish Church. Gordon was not an enthusiastic supporter of the latter and after the return of Mary, Queen of Scots - a Roman Catholic - to Scotland and her takeover of the kingdom, he assumed a low profile and the Queen issued a decree of protection to the University of Aberdeen, of which Gordon was chancellor; Gordon's nephew, moreover, was the staunchly Catholic George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly. After the downfall of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1567, Bishop Gordon appears to have accepted the authority of the Church of Scotland since he retained his see until his death on 6 August 1577.Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 122; Macfarlane, \\"Gordon, William (d. 1577)\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 4. He died at Old Aberdeen, in the Bishop's Palace, and was buried in St Machar's Cathedral. NotesReferences * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J.

The film was released straight to video. In August 2005 it was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM. Plot The film opens with a handsome young prince traveling through the forest in winter with his men. In a forest glen, the prince finds Snow White lying in a glass coffin. The seven dwarfs arrive and tell the Prince of Snow White's story through flashback. A courageous King and his fair Queen rule their kingdom well. One winter's day while sewing with her maids, the Queen accidentally pricks her finger with her needle, and a single drop of blood falls on the snow outside her windowsill. The King declares they will have a child with hair as black as ebony, cheeks as red as blood, and skin as white as snow. The Good Queen eventually gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Snow White, but dies shortly after her child is born. Some years later, the king marries again. However, the new queen (Diana Rigg) is evil and vain and jealous of Snow White (Nicola Stapleton). When her magic mirror tells her that Snow White is now the fairest in the land, the Evil Queen orders a huntsman (Amnon Meskin) to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and to bring back her liver as proof of her death. During a hunting trip, the huntsman succeeds in taking Snow White away from her father, but Snow White, realizing her stepmother's plan to destroy her, manages to escape into the forest where she finds a cottage belonging to seven kindly dwarfs - Iddy, Biddy, Kiddy, Diddy, Fiddy, Giddy and Liddy - who allow her to stay with them. The King is heartbroken when he is told that Snow White had been eaten by wild animals, and later he is killed in battle. Years later, Snow White (Sarah Patterson) grows into a beautiful young maiden. When the Evil Queen asks the magic mirror \\"who is the fairest one of all\\", she learns that Snow White is still alive. The Evil Queen attempts to kill Snow White three times. First, she disguises herself as a gypsy woman and laces up Snow White in a tight bodice, only for the dwarfs to cut the lace with scissors. The second time, she disguises herself as an Asian comb seller and gives Snow White a poisoned comb, only for the dwarfs to remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the Evil Queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White resists at first, but relents when the Evil Queen cuts the apple in half so they may share it. Snow White eats the poisoned half of the apple and collapses. The dwarfs are unable to revive her, and place her inside a glass coffin. The film returns to the present, where the dwarfs allow the Prince to take Snow White to a proper resting place. When Snow White is being transported, the coffin accidentally falls off the wagon due to a tree falling down by a snowstorm, causing the piece of poisoned apple to dislodge from Snow White's throat, and she awakens. The Prince is enchanted that Snow White magically revived herself and asks her to marry him, and she accepts. Invitations to the wedding are sent throughout the land, and the Evil Queen receives one as well, leaving the magic mirror into concluding that the Prince's bride is the fairest in the land. Enraged, the Evil Queen smashes her mirror, which causes her to age rapidly. She rushes to the church in time to see that the bride is Snow White, and then disintegrates into ashes before heading back to the carriage. Snow White and the Prince are married and live happily ever after.

Each character includes a summary when possible, the voice actor or actors associated with the character, and a description of the character along with any aliases, spouses and the character's species. The Herd=Manny Manfred \\"Manny\\", is a woolly mammoth in all five Ice Age films. His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, sarcastic and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers cave paintings of Manny with his wife and son, who were killed by humans; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in Ice Age: The Meltdown. In Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In Ice Age: Continental Drift, he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by sirens. A running gag for Manny, shown in four of the five films, is that if a certain character were to refer to him as fat, he would often deny it, saying that \\"his fur is what makes him look big\\" and that \\"it's poofy\\". Sid Sidney \\"Sid\\" is a Ground Sloth in all five films who is dull-witted, talkative, friendly, carefree, naive, accident-prone, patient and funny with a caring nature, and is voiced with a lateral lisp. Little is known from Sid's life other than that Sid once lived in a tree with other sloths that always wanted to leave Sid behind when the migration occurred, using several different ways to leave him behind. What is clear is that Sid's mother always told him that \\"bad news is just good news in disguise\\" prior to abandoning him for good. He accidentally starts a fire in the first film and learns how to do it properly towards the end; he also shows this skill in the second film, where he is worshiped by a tribe of \\"mini-sloths\\" who call him \\"Fire King\\" and try to sacrifice him. In the third film, he adopts a trio of baby T-Rexes, and is forcibly taken to the underground dinosaur land by their mother, requiring the others to come and save him. In the fourth film, it is revealed that his full name is Sidney, though this name was also used in a deleted scene of the first film. When he, Diego and Manny are on the ice and are forced up by a water spout, they see a rainbow in the bright blue sky as he told them that \\"there is a rainbow at the end of every corner.\\" A mechanical version of Sid appears in Robots during the miming scene. Sid was built along the form typical of ground sloths, short, brushy tail, clawed hands and feet, a long thin neck, ovular head with bulbous eye on both sides and a pair of buckteeth. Sid's right front tooth was slightly bigger than the left, similar to his right eye, which was also somewhat bigger than the left, both eyes of which were pale green. Sid's pelt was dirty and tan, and became brown when the fungus it carried dried out, Sid attributing the state of his pelt to his vegetarian diet, which he said led to a younger-looking pelt. In his films, Sid faints at certain times when he's getting hit - e.g. he faints when he gets hit on the nose by a block of ice and apparently get his tongue stuck to the floor of an ice cave. In the behind the scenes, the creators combined the traits of three-toed sloths and ground sloths while designing Sid and the other sloth characters. Diego Diego is a saber-toothed cat found in all five of the films. He is Shira's love interest. He has a sardonic personality, although it is not intended to be nasty. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was seemingly killed when the pack's leader, Soto, threw him against a rock but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the second film, he was revealed to suffer from aquaphobia, but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Crash and Eddie. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the \\"herd\\" too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world with Buck. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. In Ice Age: Continental Drift, another Smilodon named Shira joins the group, and Diego feels attracted to her. During the end credits, Diego and Shira are seen nuzzling each other showing that they have now become a couple. Ellie Ellie is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, Ice Age: The Meltdown. It was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the ice age. She came across two opossums named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum. Initially Manny was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got somewhat dismayed when he realized that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, Sid welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them, much to Manny's annoyance. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this tested Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb. Soon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a flashback that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth. When Manny later implied that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, she was initially angered, but in time she apologized for overreacting. Soon, however, this new \\"herd\\" reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny freed Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manny escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising. After the waters had subsided a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. He was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and confronted Ellie confessing his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepted him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manny and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers. In Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. Despite being pregnant, she bravely went on the journey, and at one point had to save her mate and friends when they were trapped in the chasm of death. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (who was named after the codeword that was used if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they reunite with Sid and return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to the herd's new home. In Ice Age: Continental Drift, she is an understanding wife and a mother. Ellie supports Peaches, when she had an argument with Manny. When the Ice Age: Continental Drift happens she aids the herd to the Land Bridge. In the end, she also fights with the Pirates. Crash and Eddie Crash and Eddie are two twin brother opossums. Adoptive brothers of Ellie, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did. They are shown to be adventurous and fun-loving, courtesy of the fact that they're both very stupid. Though they are around the same age as Ellie, they are not nearly as mature. They first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles through reeds at Sid and Diego, then roasting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After Sid invites them to travel with them, Ellie and her brothers agreed, much to the annoyance of Manny. As they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short feud when Manny tried \\"hitting on\\" Ellie. They even play dead when crows are nearby. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave. Ellie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, persuaded Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when an overzealous Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching. Eventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie. In the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dino jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid. This is not true however, due to helping Buck save Sid from his incoming death. Overall, they are very close and almost inseparable as brothers, as shown in the sequels. They are near-on identical: Crash has blue eyes and a flatter nose with ridges, and was voiced by Seann William Scott while Eddie has brown eyes and a pointier nose with a brown stripe, and was voiced by Josh Peck. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small. In Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Crash and Eddie, along with Buck, ride a pterosaur and save Sid from a lava flow heading downwards. In Ice Age: Continental Drift, they have more minor roles than in the previous films but do partake in the final battle with Gutt's crew fighting Dobson by hopping on his back and having a rodeo, but accidentally let him charge into Manny and, later Shira, knocking them onto the other ship. Peaches Peaches is the daughter of Manny and Ellie, born in the Dinosaurs' world whilst they were under attack by a pack of Guanlong. She appeared close to end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that peaches are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is voiced by Ciara Bravo in Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas as a kid, and Keke Palmer in Ice Age: Continental Drift as a teenager, and also as a young adult in Ice Age: Collision Course. Peaches appears as a teenager in Ice Age: Continental Drift. She is self-taught to do some possum moves just like her mother. Shortly after Scrat sets off a domino effect of the continents breaking apart, she is shown sneaking up in the morning going to the falls with Louis, a molehog who is also her best friend. After Manny embarrasses her in front of Ethan, her crush, and the other mammoths by grounding her, she and her father get into a fight, and as a result, when he, Diego, and Sid get separated from them on an iceberg, she feels not only helpless to stop it but also guilty. Later during the events of the film, it is Ethan who shows an interest in her hanging out with him and his friends. As a kind of condition, he suggests for her to leave Louis behind. Convinced he'd start to like her, she readily agrees. The following day, while walking with Ethan and the other mammoths, unbeknownst to them that Louis was looking for her, they begin to question her about her friendship with him. When she claims to have none so as to gain their approval, Louis overhears, also making himself known. Shortly after Louis leaves, Peaches begins to grow tired of the other mammoths' teasing, as immediately afterwards a tremor causes a dangerous moving cloud of dust, and instead of expressing concern they try to convince her that it was fun escaping the blast. Upon calling them out on their stupid behaviour, Ethan and the others carelessly judge her by her family being part possum, causing her to get upset, confront Ethan, then leave. At the end of the movie, she and her herd are, in part, saved by Louis, who bravely challenges Captain Gutt, and distracts him from Peaches by slamming a chunk of ice on his foot. His bravery, as well as Peaches' own heroics in saving her mother, impress Ethan and his friends, who ask to hang out with them instead. Louis casually agrees. In Ice Age: Collision Course, Peaches is now a young adult and prepares to marry a male mammoth named Julian. Granny Granny is a Megalonyx and also Sid's grandmother. She joins the herd after her own family abandons her, calling her \\"dead weight\\" to save their own skins before the earthquake (that and to avoid Sid). Despite, how Granny sometimes picks on and berates her grandson, Sid is very happy to have her around. Granny is loud, abrasive, tough, sarcastic, somewhat crazy, as she once thought Gutt was actually being nice to her. Over time she begins to warm up to the group, as Sid asked Granny why their own family abandoned him and Granny; for a moment, Granny sympathetically answers \\"because they think we're screw-ups and can't do anything right\\". She even helps out in several attempts to get back home. At the end Granny admits that Sid is lucky to have a real family (his herd) that care so much about him. She quickly asks Sid to chew her food, but Sid had fixed her a new set of teeth, a pair of shark teeth that were originally Raz's weapon but Granny uses them quite well as they are very sharp. It is shown in the film she had an allegedly imaginary pet named Precious, which showed up at the end and turned out to be real: a giant whale who defeats Gutt's crew (minus Squint) by blasting them away. Precious then helped the group to Switchback Cove and Granny bids her pet a fond good-bye. Louis Peaches' best friend Louis, is a timid, well-spoken, and cute molehog (a small mammal that lives during the ice ages. The molehog's name is a portmanteau of mole and hedgehog), who is always dutifully by her side and eager to help, even if it is to help her get closer to pretty boy Ethan. When Peaches' heart is ultimately broken by Ethan, Louis secretly wishes that she could see that he is the only one who adores her just as she is. Peaches is very oblivious to his crush on her. He tries to be the voice of reason when she is up to some things, because of his soft-spoken demeanor and his somewhat cowardice, Manny alongside Crash and Eddie, have dubbed him \\"Wiener\\". Even after having his feelings hurt by Peaches, Louis comes to his friends side when she is held hostage by Gutt. He fends off Gutt long enough for Peaches to escape, impressed by his bravery, Manny even encourages Louis to be more open minded to adventures like Peaches. Ethan and his posse even ask to hang out with him, as they seem to move on in life as friends. The only flaw with Louis' life in Ice Age is, along with \\"The Brat Pack\\", he seems to lack parents and other family members that he would live with. Shira Shira appears in Ice Age: Continental Drift as part of Gutt's crew, and is Captain Gutt's pawn. She is a dazzlingly beautiful, female saber-toothed cat and Diego's lover resembling a snow leopard. She makes her first appearance in Scrat's Continental Crack-up: Part 2 standing next to Captain Gutt, who is holding Scrat. Shira first appears when Gutt's crew attacks the herds \\"ship\\". Diego is smitten upon his first sight on her as she is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen. Diego, wanting himself, Manny, Sid, and Granny to get back home, tries to chomp off all the pirates' ropes from their \\"ship\\", but is too late as Shira arrives and restrains him, mocking him for his declaration of \\"I don't fight girls\\" by pinning him down and saying, \\"I can see why\\". After Manny and the others escape by capsizing Gutt's iceberg, Shira is seen in the water, calling out for her crewmates' help; only Flynn is concerned over Shira's whereabouts, but Gutt ignores this and demands his crew to move on forward without her. She is rescued against her will by Manny, and is angered when Diego calls her \\"Kitty\\" for calling them a \\"bad joke\\" of a herd. She journeyed with the herd to an island. Once there, she attempts to escape, but Diego catches up to her and she is imprisoned in a tree, much to her anger. That night, Shira is approached by Diego, who learns she left her pack as he once did. Diego tells her that she simply traded one pack for another, and that his herd always has each other's backs, pointing out that Gutt hadn't made any thoughts of planning a search party for her in the first place. The next morning, Shira escapes and finds Gutt making a new ship on the other side of the island. Gutt angrily berates her for not killing the herd, and punishes her by making Squint his new first mate while she gets demoted. Gutt then orders Shira to target Diego, declaring that he would have a tiger-skin rug when it ended, he didn't care whose (somewhat proving Diego's point to Shira that Gutt never had his back on her or anyone else). When the herd enacts their plans to take Gutt's new ship back home, Shira once again tackles Diego, who convinces her to turn against Gutt and come with him. Because of their newfound love, she follows Diego to the ship, but on seeing that Gutt is catching up to them, secretly puts ice in his way. As the herd floats away, Shira tells Diego that she has his back, while both looking at each other longingly as the boat leaves implying they have feelings for each other. During the return home, Diego realized he had fallen in love with Shira, despite denying it to Manny and Sid. Later, when Gutt is holding Peaches hostage, Shira is seen struggling to get up, implying that Gutt had physically punished Shira for her betrayal. During the fight, she protects Ellie from Squint, mocking the rabbit's \\"cute little bunny nose\\". After the defeat of Gutt's crew, Shira joins the herd, sharing a loving look with Diego. She also rests her head on Diego's shoulder during the herd's landing on switchback cove. In the end credits, Shira nuzzles against Diego's side showing that they have now become a couple. Julian Julian is a young and courageous mammoth who is Peaches' fianc√© and part-time member of The Herd and The Brat Pack. Julian may be somewhat absent-minded, but is devoted and caring toward Peaches, and wants to be part of her family. Brooke Brooke is a British Megalonyx living in Geotopia who becomes Sid's love interest and new girlfriend. She appears in Ice Age: Collision Course. Scrat Scrat is a saber-toothed squirrel who is obsessed with collecting acorns, constantly putting his life in danger to obtain and defend them. He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main characters, though the two do intersect at times. In a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words \\"squirrel\\" and \\"rat\\", his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the Ice Age DVD commentary, he is referred to as \\"The Scrat\\" by directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. Scrat is voiced in all Ice Age movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on eight occasions, mostly with Sid. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it. He later meets Manny, Sid, and Diego asking him where the baby's family is and Scrat attempts to tell them about nearby saber- toothed tigers, but Diego kicks Scrat away before he could do so. At the end of the second film, after Scrat created a hole in the valley and released all the melted ice, later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already almost died and gone to paradise and was about to get a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls onto Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Next, he appears when Sid's \\"children\\" are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat. Also, when Scratte rips off his fur, he screams so loud the herd can hear him, causing Crash and Eddie to deem the place a \\"Jungle of Misery\\". Lastly, while Diego is sleeping, he wakes up when he gets hit with Scrat's acorn. In the fourth film, when Sid pries open a clam, he finds Scrat inside. Sid's grandmother mistakes Scrat for a rat and continuously hits him with her cane until he falls into the ocean. Scrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully \\"battles\\" Sid. Scrat is the main character in four short films. In the first, Gone Nutty, he loses his collection of acorns in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the continental drift. In the second film, No Time for Nuts, Scrat finds a time machine left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period. A third Scrat short, Scrat's Continental Crack-up, was released in 2010 accompanying the feature Gulliver's Travels, and later with Rio as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie Ice Age: Continental Drift. A fourth and most recent short film, Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe, was released in 2015 preceding The Peanuts Movie. Scrat has a cameo in Surviving Sid, that is important to the plot. Scrat is the main character in the Ice Age: The Meltdown video game. He is also playable in the other two games based on the series. Scrat makes a cameo appearance in the Family Guy episode \\"Sibling Rivalry\\", in a cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin says Scrat's nuts are his, leading Scrat to attack Peter. The origin of Scrat is disputed. Cartoon designer Ivy Supersonic claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in Skidmore College's Case Green. She called her character \\"Sqrat\\" and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before Ice Age went into development. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in Ice Age as \\"Sqrat\\", though her creation was not sabre-toothed. Ivy Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox Studios. She turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case is currently in appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). She still has hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement. Supersonic did win a partial summary judgement from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in a reverse suit, Fox Film Corporation v. Ivy Silberstein (her real name), in which Fox had tried to prevent her from registering the trade mark \\"SQRAT\\". According to Wedge, artist Peter de Seve came up with the design for Scrat after a visit to the Museum of Natural History. Wedge called it \\"sort of a squirrel based on some lemur.\\" While initially created as a fictional species for comedic purposes, in 2011 a mammal quite similar to Scrat was described. The newly described taxon, Cronopio dentiacutus was not a squirrel, and did not live in the Cenozoic; it belonged to the dryolestoids, a group of mammals thought to be closely related to therians, and it lived approximately 100 million years ago in Patagonia. The precedence of the animated character to the discovery of the real animal is an example of what is known as the \\"Dim Effect\\". As of the 2013 film Epic, Scrat has gone on to become the mascot of Blue Sky Studios and is featured in their production logo. Appearing in Ice Age=Roshan Roshan, or \\"Pinky\\" as what Manny called him, is the Neanderthal baby that Manny, Sid, and Diego return to his father. He is the young son of a Neanderthal tribal chief. While sleeping one morning, his tribe is attacked by a pack of smilodons. The leader of the pack, Soto, wants to kill the baby as revenge for the baby's father killing half the pack and using their skin as clothes and their flesh as food. His mother is able to fend off Diego, whose mission is to retrieve him. However, she is cornered over a waterfall. In a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding the baby tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manny and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives the baby to Manny and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them. Roshan's primary care-provider is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has concern for him, Manny being too disillusioned to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him. Manny, scarred by his previous experience with humans, is reluctant to have anything to do with the baby, but eventually bonds with him. At the end of the movie, the baby is reunited with his tribe. Soto's Pack Soto's Pack is a group of saber-toothed cats in Ice Age. They targeted Roshan as revenge on his tribe of Neanderthals because half of their pack was killed by them. Diego was formerly of this group before he defected to Manny and Sid's side. =Soto= Soto is the violent and sadistic Smilodon who is the leader of a pack of saber-toothed cats. He wants to eat Roshan in vengeance for the murders of several of his pack-mates. As part of his plan to kidnap Roshan, Soto plans an attack on the human camp so that while he and three other pack members would attack the humans, Diego would sneak in, unnoticed, and abduct Roshan. Diego fails at this task, leaving Soto furious, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others and threatens have him served as a replacement if he fails. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth. Soto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manny and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manny and Roshan with a decoy made of snow. Soto fought viciously in the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manny, but was stopped by the now-reformed Diego, whom he severely maimed. Out of anger, Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice, knocking loose a row of icicles, the sharp ice formations falling, and end up killing Soto offscreen. =Zeke= Zeke is an overactive Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack. He is led by Soto who is out to seek Roshan and kill him. Zeke is dark-gray and looked rough, as well as acting the part of a suck up. It is revealed in a deleted scene that he, like the other members of his pack, wanted very much to follow the \\"walking buffet\\" south, but Soto would not hear of it. Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. Diego had him inform Soto that there will be a mammoth traveling with the baby as well. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to kill Sid and Roshan, but was outwitted by Sid who stomped him into a tiny crevice with his hindquarters sticking out. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards. =Oscar= Oscar is a tall Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack. Oscar is shown to doubting Diego's abilities because he messed up once in bringing Roshan to Soto. In a deleted scene, he is seen telling his packmates of his disapproval of Soto's plans to stay and hunt the humans instead of following the migrating herds traveling south. Oscar went along with Zeke to find Diego and warn him to hurry and bring Roshan. Oscar made it with the rest of the pack to Half Peak where he attempted to kill Manny but was defeated along with the others. He is last seen running away after he and Lenny see Soto killed by Manny, leaving him and Lenny's fates unknown. =Lenny= Lenny is a rotund Homotherium and a member of Soto's pack. Lenny, along with the rest of the pack, attacked the human encampment but were fended off by the humans' dogs who fought alongside the humans against the pack sending them off. One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Bitter at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders Diego to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peak where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack members Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth. Lenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peak where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, \\"Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!\\" and \\"I told you to knock it off!\\"). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to strike him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had been shown real friendship and appreciation from Manny and Sid so he tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise given away, the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where hit by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had thwarted Soto's attacks. Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice and a number of icicles fall down and kill him. Seeing the death of their leader, Lenny and Oscar run off. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards. Unlike the rest of his pack who are all saber-toothed cats, Lenny is a scimitar-toothed cat as stated in the book Ice Age: The Essential Guide. Runar Runar was the chieftain of the Neanderthal tribe shown in the first film. Runar was a leader for a tribe of Neanderthals (referred in the film as humans). He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had trained dire wolves that detected Soto's pack coming and alerted the human tribe to battle the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar while the rest of the tribe fought the other saber-tooth tigers and unleash their wolves to help. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth. Runar tried to help his wife and son, but is stopped by Soto and Oscar. After the fight, he finds out that his son and wife had disappeared. Runar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the dangerous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manny and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manny at first, as he appeared violent while his tribe quickly rush in to attack Manny and Sid. Upon seeing Roshan, he quickly came to see that they meant no harm, simply to return his child and stopped his tribe from attacking them. Runar thanked Manny by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and after letting his son say goodbye to Manny and Sid, Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow. Nadia Nadia was the wife of the chieftain of a neanderthal tribe shown in the first film. Nadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed tigers invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan in revenge for the tribe killing half of their pack. Nadia fended off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from Diego who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a high waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With the last of her strength, Nadia nudged Roshan to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing. Her fate remains unknown, although it is heavily implied that she may have drowned. The Dodo Birds These Dodos are portrayed as greedy for watermelons claiming it to be their private stockpile for the ice age. All these dodos hate to be extinct. Some appear to be military marching. Trying to get a watermelon from Sid, Diego and Manny who try to ask for it for the baby's hunger, some of these dodos accidentally fall to where they tossed the melon. Four of these fall into the pit to burn to death as one warns a few, where another melon is also incinerated. The rest are defeated by Sid who protects the last melon from them by getting through them. In Ice Age: The Meltdown, another dodo gets fried while attempting to cross the geyser fields and in the epilogue of the sequel, there is a dodo choir singing angelically as Scrat enters heaven. =Dab= Dab was the head dodo shown in the first film. The dodos were collecting a stockpile for the winter, and one of them stole the melon that Manny had spotted for Roshan. When Manny, Sid and Diego went to the dodos to get the melon back, they found the dodos on parade. The dodos' stockpile so far consisted only of three melons, including the stolen melon. After Manny pointed this out, the dodos fought to stop Manny, Diego and Sid getting at the melons. In the fight, the first melon fell over a cliff and several dodos, including the flock's \\"last female\\", jumped over as well in a suicidal attempt to retrieve it. The second melon bounced into a boiling tar pit, along with three more unfortunate dodos who were trying to stop it falling in. Sid managed to get the last melon, and the remaining dodos also fell off the cliff, a parody as to why they are extinct today. Carl and Frank Carl and Frank are an Embolotherium and a Brontops respectively. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn. They referred to Sid as an overgrown weasel. The two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the ground sloth was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the dandelion. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been \\"killed\\" by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off) and gave up their chase post-haste stating that \\"carnivores have all the fun.\\" Carl and Frank aren't seen again after this. Jennifer and Rachel Jennifer and Rachel are two Megalonyx from the first film. The two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Roshan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type. These two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him \\"pig\\". Jennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and a medium-sized nose. Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head and a smaller nose. Sylvia Sylvia is a female Megalonyx who was cut from the first film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release as well as the film-to-book adaptation. Sylvia wanted Sid to travel with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, put her in the path of some running glyptodonts to send her off. Sylvia eventually found him again, and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid tricked her into thinking that he was getting turnips for their migration, and then ran off to escape, but she followed him into the jaws of Diego, the saber- toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to \\"eat him\\". It is presumed that after that, she left Sid alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur, green eyes and a small nose. According to the DVD commentaries, Sylvia was cut because the scriptwriters felt that Sid's behavior towards her made him too unlikable, and that her scenes detracted from the film's main plot. Additionally, the first movie had a different ending planned out. Sid and Manny headed south without Diego (due to his death, which was changed) and met up with the other animals. Sid had matured after witnessing Diego's death, and upon seeing Sylvia for the third time, was nicer to her, even asking her to be his mate. Sylvia was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of her scenes were completely animated and rendered, and she was seen in the first few trailers of the movie as well as the initial posters. Appearing in Ice Age: The Meltdown=Fast Tony A Holmesina living in the days of the Ice Age, Fast Tony was a peddler trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his \\"assistant\\", an insipid glyptodon named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off \\"his own mother for a grape\\". Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals. Stu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal \\"mobile home\\". Fast Tony was last seen at the end of Ice Age: The Meltdown using Stu's shell as a raft. =Stu= Stu was a Glyptodon who was Fast Tony's partner. He seemed to be disliked by Tony due to his stupid personality. He assisted Fast Tony to warn the valley that the dam of ice would burst and helped to demonstrate Fast Tony's snorkel. After the revelation of the flood was proved to be true, Stu took the test snorkel and used it to swim underwater. Shortly after scaring James, a young anteater, Stu was grabbed and pulled underwater by an unknown attacker. As the other animals begin to leave, Fast Tony returns to the pool to get Stu to come along, but Stu's shell is suddenly spat out of the water by the unknown assailant. Fast Tony, after looking at the shell, sees that it makes a great mobile home and runs off after the other animals to try and unload it on someone. Meanwhile, the unknown attackers turn out to be the marine reptiles Cretaceous and Maelstrom. In the ending after the flood, Fast Tony is discovered to have been using the shell as a boat, but he leaves the shell behind as he no longer needs it. Mr. and Mrs. Start Mr. and Mrs. Start are two Starts that are shown resting at the Glacier Water Park where they complain about the heat. During this conversation, the ice that Mrs. Start was on cracked and she fell into the water. The Lone Gunslinger The Lone Gunslinger is a Teratornis. The Lone Gunslinger arrives to confirm Manny's suspicions to the animals at Glacier Water Park that the ice dam will break. He acts as the voice that warns the other animals of the dangers coming soon due to the valley where they reside flooding up with water. The Lone Gunslinger only warns them of the danger and little else, rather hoping that one or two of the animals leaving will die, furnishing food for him and the other vultures which he is presumably family and friends with. As he watches all of the creatures in the valley leave to safety, he makes cryptic statements with his Teratornis friends about it and this escalades to the point of singing a musical number on how much they plotted to eat the other animals. The Lone Gunslinger was last shown flying over the \\"boat\\" full of escaping animals and making provocative remarks. In the storybook version, he and his fellow Teratornis were shown to be feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom's corpses. Cretaceous Cretaceous is an Cymbospondylus. Cretaceous is shown in the beginning frozen in a great block of ice that was jarred loose when the wall of ice began crumbling. The ice melted, releasing both him and Maelstrom into the lake which was all but abandoned by most animals. When they made it to the ice lake, the first animal that they had encountered and eaten was Stu, leaving behind only his shell. The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manny's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Cretaceous made a great lunge at Manny, but was caught on his tusks, only to be flung far off, hitting a piece of ice and falling back into the water. Later, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie. Manny devised a plan to rid himself of the two sea reptiles, by having them try to chase him, he tricked them into hitting a log that was wedged under a large rock. The plan worked, freeing Ellie, and the boulder falls on Cretaceous and Maelstrom, killing them. In the storybook version, The Lone Gunslinger and his fellow Teratornis were shown to be feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom. Maelstrom Maelstrom is a pliosaur. Maelstrom is shown in the beginning frozen in a great block of ice that was jarred loose when the wall of ice began crumbling. The ice melted, releasing both Cretaceous and him into the lake which was all but abandoned by most animals. When they made it to the ice lake, the first animal that they had encountered and eaten was Stu, leaving behind only his shell. The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manny's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Maelstrom intended to eat Sid but could not catch him, as Sid was already escaping with Diego, and had only just escaped Maelstrom as he broke off a massive chunk of ice where the sloth and saber-tooth had stood only moments before. Later, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie. Manny devised a plan to rid himself of the two sea reptiles, by having them try to chase him, he tricked them into hitting a log that was wedged under a large rock. The plan worked, freeing Ellie and killing Cretaceous and Maelstrom. In the storybook version, The Lone Gunslinger and his fellow Teratornis were shown to be feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom. Piranhas The number of Piranhas resided in the ice lakes of the waterpark, where they were pursued by flocks of Baptornis and scattered by other animals. The piranha, however, found potential prey in the form of Scrat that had fall in the lake. The piranhas bared their teeth and chased Scrat out of the water onto an ice floe, one leaping out of the water and biting him on the paw; this paw was holding his prized acorn. Angry that something had attempted to take his acorn. Scrat seized another piranha and used it to hit at others, fighting and kicking the fish away, stunning them all. As one attempted to edge back to the water, Scrat stomped on its side, forcing it to release an acorn that is held. In Ice Age 3, a school of piranha met a baby Tyrannosaurus (one of Momma's babies that had been kidnapped by Sid) and bared their teeth at it. The young Tyrannosaurus bared his own teeth and frightened the fish off. Mini- Sloths A tribe of Mini Sloths are smaller sloths who worship Sid and call him \\"Fire King\\". Immediately afterwards, they try to throw him into lava, believing that they can avert the flood by sacrificing him. However, he escapes. Ashley Ashley is a minor beaver character in the second film. In her appearance, she treats Sid like a pi√±ata and appears to be a ringleader among the kids. Appearing in Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs=Scratte Scratte (pronounced \\"Scrat-tay\\") is a seductive female saber-toothed flying squirrel that makes her debut in Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. She is seen in the second trailer with Scrat battling with her for the acorn by propelling themselves down a gorge to reach the fallen acorn, and succeeding. Scratte is also seen as a love interest for Scrat. Scratte's personality traits have been shown to be flirtatious, feisty, and intelligent. She is equally determined in catching the acorn and uses her feminine wiles to her advantage. She doesn't, however, seem to be nearly as obsessed with acorns as her male counterpart, as she was shown trying to destroy the acorn at the end of the film out of jealousy. Scratte will often injure and manipulate Scrat in the process of retrieving it. However, her attraction to him is implied and fully emerged when he saved her from falling into lava. In the fourth movie, Scratte appeared again in a cameo role as a Siren only to then be dismissed by a disinterested Scrat. In addition, tons of her species live on Scratlantis. Buck Buck (short for Buckminster) is a weasel that makes an appearance in Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. He is missing his right eye and wears a leaf as an impromptu eyepatch, as well as having a scar on one of his ears and seems slightly insane (he claims that he woke up one day, married to an ugly pineapple, but he still loved \\"her\\", and Manny calls him a \\"deranged hermit.\\" He also claims to have sadly been \\"killed by Rudy,\\" although he was not). According to the official website, Buck is one-eyed and relentless in his hunting for dinosaurs. Buck's archenemy is a large albino Baryonyx he calls Rudy, who gouged out Buck's eye and attempted to eat him, but failed after Buck grabbed onto to Rudy's uvula, swung on it, and then let go, knocking out Rudy's teeth, which he kept and later sharpened into a knife that he carries with him. Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world. Buck first meets Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego, and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as \\"preggers\\") after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a Harpactognathus. After Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface. He and Rudy proceed to continue their battle. Buck and Rudy make brief cameos in Scrat's Continental Crack-up and Ice Age: Continental Drift when Scrat falls through the Earth and passes them. He returns to help the herd with an ancient stone pillar and rejoins them to stop the asteroid in Ice Age: Collision Course while being pursued by a family of Dino-Birds. Due to his voice actor, Buck speaks with a British accent. Momma Momma was a female Tyrannosaurus. She took Sid from his herd when he took her eggs from her. She brings Sid to Lava Falls and the two compete to see who can care for her babies better. Sid loses, but is allowed to stay. However, they are separated later and Sid is attacked by Rudy. She is also called Momzilla by Sid. Momma later returns when Manny, Ellie, Diego, Sid, Crash, Eddie, and Buck are under attack by Rudy and knocks Rudy off a cliff to his apparent death proceeding to bid Sid farewell. Rudy Rudy is a gigantic albino Baryonyx in the third film who is feared by all the creatures in the valley except Buck and Momma. When Buck first arrived in the jungle, he was attacked by Rudy, who scratched him in the right eye, thus poking it out, and very nearly devoured him. Buck escaped, knocking out one of Rudy's teeth in the process. Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since, especially since the impact left behind a crack in his mouth which prevented any new teeth from growing. (Note: Rudy is constantly mistaken for a Spinosaurus, and although he has features of both species, the filmmakers have directly stated he is a Baryonyx.) Rudy first appears when he attacks Sid and chases him onto a rock floating over Lava Falls, and later attacks Sid and company full force as they are about to exit the jungle. The group quickly proves to be no match for the Baryonyx, but are saved by Momma, who knocks him off of a cliff. Rudy survives, however, and he and Buck continue their eternal war. Rudy is last seen roaring in frustration as Buck is riding on top of the massive dinosaur laughing, as Rudy runs through the jungle. Buck and Rudy made a brief cameo in the following film Ice Age: Continental Drift. Johnny Johnny is a young aardvark who is swallowed whole and alive by Egbert. Johnny's mother demands that Sid, currently posing as the young dinosaurs' father orders the dinosaur to return her son or else they will leave the playground. Johnny was not found just then; instead a young Gastornis, named Madison, is brought up. But then Manny and Ellie come by. Egbert got scared, and immediately regurgitated Johnny. His mother promptly drags him off. He is referred to by Sid and his mother as \\"Little Johnny\\". Johnny's Mother The unnamed mother of Johnny. She looked on in horror when Egbert tried to eat little Johnny. She later demanded that Sid tell Egbert to spit her son out. Egbert seemed to comply, but instead spat out a young Diatryma named Madison to her annoyance. When Manny arrived on the scene, Egbert regurgitated Little Johnny in shock and his mother comforted him. Gazelle This unnamed Gazelle was shown being chased by Diego only for him to end up exhausted. The gazelle heckled him and ran off. The same gazelle later appeared running by Diego to escape the Tyrannosaurus. Pudgy Beaver Mom The unnamed Pudgy Beaver Mom is the mother of a young beaver. She was among the village of animals that reacted to Ellie's false alarm of her pregnancy. When Sid commented on the beaver mom's pregnancy, the beaver mom angrily tells Sid that she is not pregnant and snapped a stick to hit Sid with it. When the beaver mom's young child ventured into the playground that Manny had built, she called out Sid over the fact that the three Tyrannosaurus children were picking on her child. Sid tells her that he's a single parent. Egbert, Yoko, and Shelly These baby dinosaurs are three baby Tyrannosaurus from Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, consisting of two males (Egbert and Yoko), and one female (Shelly). Sid took them away from their mother, but she came searching for them and took Sid away with them, then she later became friends with Sid at the end of the movie. They are very friendly dinosaurs, but due to being carnivores, they go too far in playing with other animals which eventually winds up with one of them eating a couple of the kids. Despite knowing that Sid isn't their real father, they still loved and care for him to a point of protecting him from their angry mother. They are later returned to their mother at the end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Roger Roger is a Harpactognathus who was used by Buck, along with Crash and Eddie, to go to the Lava Falls to rescue Sid from Rudy. During the attempt, they were attacked by a flock of Cearadactylus, but they managed to evade them and rescue Sid in time. After returning to the Plates of Woe, the pterosaur flew away after Buck asked if it had \\"ever thought of settling down and starting a family\\". Roger's gender is unspecified in the film, but it is referred to as a female in the video game adaption. Other dinosaurs Among the other dinosaurs that live in the underground valley are Ankylosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Kentrosaurus (which is depicted with a long neck like a Miragaia longicollum), Iguanodon, Troodon, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, Chasmosaurus, Archaeopteryx, Guanlong and the pterosaurs Harpactognathus and Cearadactylus (the filmmakers refer to them as \\"pterodactyl\\" and \\"pterosaur\\" respectively). Also, the Dilophosaurus appears in the video game adaption where it has the same description as the version seen in the Jurassic Park franchise. Appearing in Ice Age: Continental Drift=Captain Gutt's Pirates A group of pirates that sailed the seas. Among its members are: =Captain Gutt= Gutt is a Gigantopithecus who is a self-styled master and pirate captain of the high seas. His name is based on the long sharpened fingernails that he uses to \\"gut\\" his enemies. He captures Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, and Granny and attempts to make them part of his crew. His friendly demeanor quickly vanishes when Manny refuses; he throws the mammoth and his friends overboard, and furiously vows revenge when they destroy his ship and bounty during their escape. Gutt enslaves a population of hyraxes to build a new ship for him, and also strips Shira of her rank as first mate when she reveals she did not attack Manny, giving her position to Squint. Gutt leads his crew to battle against the unenslaved hyraxes, only for the hyraxes to be revealed as a distraction while Manny steals his new ship. Enraged, Gutt quickly forges a new ship out of a wall of ice, propelled by his legion of narwhals. Gutt arrives at Manny's home, and takes Ellie, Peaches, and the other animals hostage. Manny turns himself in to free his wife and daughter, but Gutt goes back on his word, stating that Manny took everything he had from him and the evil captain intended to do the same. However, the timely arrival of Louis, Peaches' friend, sparks a fierce battle between the pirates and Manny's herd. Gutt tries to fight Manny along with Raz, but Diego fights Gutt himself. Gutt chases Diego up a tree on the herd's ship, and knocks the sabertooth down with the rest of herd. Gutt corners the herd, but he and his pirates are defeated by Granny's pet whale Precious. Gutt is swift enough to dodge Precious' blasts while Squint, Raz, Flynn, Dobson, Silas, and Gupta are knocked onto the side of their ship and into the sea; Gutt escapes and leaves his crew behind. He is about to kill Ellie when Peaches knocks him onto the back of the ice. He then leaps at Manny and refuses to let him return to his family. A new landmass emerges and launches the iceberg that the two are standing on into the air. Gutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that \\"the sea isn't big enough\\" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe. Manny catches the log and hits Gutt, sending the evil ape flying out of fight. He lands in a cave river and grabs a piece of ice to float on the water; he notices fins sticking out of the water, and is shortly after eaten offscreen by a siren posing as a female Gigantopithecus. Note: Jeremy Renner was originally set to voice the character, but was replaced by Peter Dinklage due scheduling conflicts involving The Bourne Legacy. Captain Gutt was initially written as a bear, but designer Peter DeS√®ve had a hard time designing an ursine villain, and thus instead designed him as a more versatile primate. =Flynn= Flynn is a large English elephant seal (appearing to be just as big as or even bigger than Manny in the film) who makes his first appearance in the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up. He provides the muscle of the crew. His lack of intelligence is the source of comic relief throughout the film. Flynn likes to eat fruit, and calls the song titled \\"Master of the Seas\\" a sea shanty. When the pirates first encounter Manny's herd, Flynn inadvertently gives them directions to return to the continent, much to Gutt's exasperation. The seal then joined the attack on the herd, squashing Sid underneath his bulk. When Manny's herd destroys the ship, leaving the pirates to drift at sea, Flynn initially panics at the prospect of drowning, but is reminded by an annoyed Gutt that he is able to swim. Flynn worries about Shira when Gutt leaves her for dead, but he later propels the pirates to land aboard a small raft made of ice. In the final battle, Flynn and Gupta corner Sid and Granny, only for the latter to summon Precious, sending the pirates running in fear. Flynn rejoins the battle against Manny, but is defeated when Precious blasts him with water. =Raz= Raz is an Australian Procoptodon who serves as the crew's resident weapons and artillery expert, hiding an arsenal of deadly bone swords in her pouch and using her powerful legs to launch projectiles at enemies by kicking them. In the final melee against Manny's herd, she battles Manny herself, until she is blasted away by Precious. =Silas= Silas is a blue-footed booby who usually scouts out for trouble ahead of the pirates. Silas informs Captain Gutt of Manny and his herd's presence, claiming that their raft was a huge bounty ripe for the taking. Silas later attacks Manny personally while the mammoth is escaping the hyrax island, but Manny bats him away with his trunk. In the final battle, Silas launches Gupta at Manny's face to distract him. =Squint= Squint is a Palaeolagus. He makes his first appearance in the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up. He is overconfident, somewhat psychotic, and dislikes being called adorable; he is berated many times by Gutt and Shira for trying to assume authority over the crew. Squint holds a rivalry with Shira, which reaches its climax when Squint becomes Gutt's new first mate after Gutt insults Shira for failing to kill Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny. In the final battle, Squint attempts to attack Shira as she is trying to free Ellie, but Shira mocks Squint's 'adorable nose', which agitates him and allows Ellie to stomp on him. Squint later resurfaces in Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade where he wants revenge on the Herd but he gets defeated by Sid and then he falls in a Crash and Eddie's trap for April's Fools. =Dobson= Dobson is a Metridiochoerus, who speaks in growls, oinks, and other pig noises (although he appeared to be singing along with the crew in the \\"Master of the Seas\\" musical sequence). He teams up with Raz in firing the cannons, loading them with chunks of ice for Raz to fire with her powerful kangaroo legs, and leaps down onto the heroes's ship with her to corner Manny. Dobson later takes part in the final battle, fighting Crash and Eddie \\"rodeo- style\\", and is able to charge into Manny and knock him into the other ship along with Shira. However, Dobson was blasted away by Precious along with the rest of the pirate crew. =Gupta= Gupta is a Bengali badger who's fur pattern on his back resembles a skull and crossbones, allowing the crew to use him as their pirate flag. He is shown to be somewhat cowardly, wishing to fly the white colors of his underbelly when the pirate ship was being destroyed. In the climax of the film, Gupta and Flynn corner Sid and Granny, but are scared off by Granny's pet whale Precious. Gupta later is dropped onto Manny's face by Silas, distracting the mammoth long enough for Dobson to attack him and to corner the herd. However, Gupta and the rest of the crew are blasted away by Precious. Ethan Ethan is a teenage woolly mammoth who takes a liking to Peaches, Manny and Ellie's teenage daughter, and becomes her love interest later. He is a thrill-loving teenager who is openminded to Peaches being part of his group, and may have returned her affections. But he is shown to be shallow when he tells Peaches to stop hanging around Louis. When Peaches sees she has hurt her friend's feelings, and that Ethan and his group are lacking in common sense, she decides to leave. Ethan rudely remarks that \\"it's bad enough her family is half-possum\\", angering Peaches. Ethan, unlike his posse, seems to be at least partially rational, and might have felt guilt from hurting Peaches' feelings. After Louis helps to save Peaches, Ethan and his group are impressed by his bravery. He asks to hang around with him and Peaches, to which Louis accepts. Steffie Steffie is a teenager woolly mammoth who is the alpha girl of the Valley's popular crew. Her friends, Katie and Meghan, are always in agreement with her. She does all that she can to keep any other girls away from Ethan, which is why she dislikes and insults Peaches. She is the sassy leader of the Brat Pack. Although she is rude and unkind, she can be sweet when she is with Ethan; when Louis and Peaches show their bravery fighting Gutt, she begins to warm up to them. Katie and Meghan Katie and Meghan are teenage woolly mammoths who are two of the first-rate members of the Valley's popular crew. Katie and Meghan are always in agreement with what Steffie says, and they do everything that Steffie does or asks. To Steffie, Katie is likely more important than Meghan, as they sometimes leave Meghan alone. Katie is known as the gossip girl of the Brat Pack. Sid's Family Sid is surprised by the return of his dysfunctional relatives who had abandoned him in the first film as they have a tendency to abandon him at specific points. His family consist of: * Milton - Sid's father. He is kind of slow as Eunice would have to slap Milton to remind him to pretend to miss Sid. * Eunice - Sid's melodramatic mother. She is not a good mother and tends to bump Marshall aside when he gets in her way. * Marshall - Sid's 20-year-old brother with a dwarfish appearance. * Uncle Fungus - Sid's hygienically-challenged uncle who sports moss and fungus on his fur. They dump their eighty-year-old Granny for Sid to take care of. Believing something was happening, the family left the land; shortly thereafter, the Pangaea supercontinent begun to fragment. Despite how his family had abandoned him, Sid was very enthusiastic to see them and still loved them. Eunice seemed to care for her son, as she said she was worried about him when they were separated. When Sid replies that he thought they abandoned him, Marshall replies coldly that they did, but Eunice insists they were still worried about him and prompts her husband to insist they did. However, when Eunice instructed Sid to show Granny around, she quickly shows herself to be as cruel as the rest of Sid's family, who leave hastily without looking back. Milton adds that Granny was simply \\"dead weight\\". Their current status is unknown. Ariscratle Ariscratle is a saber-toothed squirrel that lives on Scratlantis. His name is a pun on the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Sirens Sirens are shape-shifting fish-like creatures that lay on rock outcrops near the ocean, where they lure in creatures by casting hallucinations of entities attractive to the creatures (such as loved ones, attractive potential mates, or even items such as Scrat's prized acorn). Scrat kills a siren when trying to bury it, leading the others to chase him. At the end of the film, one lures Captain Gutt and consumes him after assuming the form of a female Gigantopithecus. They are loosely based on the Sirens of Greek mythology. Precious Precious is a 123-foot-long Livyatan with three rows of teeth. Precious was the pet of a ground sloth named Granny; Granny's family, especially Marshall, thought her senile for talking on about her \\"dead pet\\". But Precious was alive and had grown to an enormous size. When Granny, along with her grandson Sid and his friends Manny and Diego, were confronted at a cliff overhanging the ocean by a number of pirates, Granny called Precious, who rose up out of the water, opened her mouth, and allowed Granny to walk in along with Sid (who was disgusted at the smell inside the whale). Later, Granny and Sid use her like a submarine to fight with the pirates. Large, even for a whale, Precious was the beloved pet of Granny, who was always seen throwing food into the ocean when she was near it. Precious was loyal to Granny, such that Granny could step inside the whale's mouth and commandeer her like a submarine. Her blowhole was shown as being capable of delivering a nasty attack to the pirates, and she was able to swallow Manny to prevent him from falling in the sea. Hyraxes Hyraxes have only been seen in Ice Age: Continental Drift and Ice Age: Collision Course. They are first seen being forced to work as slaves by Captain Gutt, as they are used to load Gutt's treasure onboard and are even used to swab the deck as part of a mop. Manny, Sid and Diego encounter the hyraxes that were not enslaved during a short trek on a deserted island in the jungle. Though somewhat wary of the visitors, the hyraxes quickly warm up to the Sub-Zero Heroes. Manny feels that, if the hyraxes helped them, they could defeat the pirates; unfortunately, the hyraxes are unable to comprehend English and misinterpret Manny's request as asking for food. Eventually, Sid is able to communicate to them that an alliance is necessary if the other hyraxes are to be freed and the pirates are to be defeated, much to the surprise of Manny and Diego. The lead hyrax (distinguished by his bushy eyebrows, lighter fur coloration, and lower voice tone), who hates Gutt with a passion, rallies his forces and decides to help the herd, much to the herd's delight. During the attack on the pirates, the lead hyrax spearheads a cavalry attack, followed by a dive bombing rescue, which is a diversion used to trick the pirates into leaving the slave hyraxes and their ship unguarded while the herd frees the captives and overtakes the ship. The enslaved hyraxes take an immense liking to Diego after he frees them. As the heroes escape on Gutt's new ship, the hyraxes fashion small ice boats, which they use to sail away to a new home in South America, taunting the pirates as they leave. The hyraxes are last seen in South America, where they have made a new home and have even carved a hyrax- sized replica of the Statue of Liberty, welcoming the other animals. Pirate rats A number of pirate rats (or pie-rats) made their homes on the \\"ship\\" of Captain Gutt, actually a giant iceberg carved into a seaworthy vessel with Gutt at its helm and a number of other animals as its crew. The rats subsided more or less well off with Gutt on board, though one of them suffered Gutt's annoyance when it was caught mocking his apish movements and thus picked up by the ape and flung off the ship. Later, once a number of seaborne mammals accidentally broke down Gutt's vessel, the rats abandoned ship, escaping into the waters below, with at least one pushed out forcefully by Scrat, another mammal taken hostage by Gutt. Giant crab The giant crab is a minor character in the fourth film. The giant crab was seen aboard Manny, Diego and Sid's \\"ship\\" during a storm. After trying to escape, Sid was trapped on the edge of the floating land. The crab tried to attack him, but it noticed a giant wave heading towards them; Sid, noticing it too, clutched onto the crab's leg in a terrified trance. As soon as the wave was gone, Sid tried to thank the giant crab for saving his life, but was horrified to see only its leg remaining, with leg then being blown away by the wind. Appearing in Ice Age: Collision Course=Dino-Bird Family The Dino-Bird Family is a family of Bird-like Dromaeosaurid Dinosaurs that first appear in Ice Age: Collision Course. They make a living stealing eggs from other dinosaurs. The Dino-Bird Family take their leave from the dinosaur habitat underground where they pursue Buck when he steals back one of the Triceratops eggs that they have stolen. While they were determined to stop Buck at the time he was assisting the Herd from combating the threat of an asteroid, they end up giving up on targeting Buck and help the Herd in stopping the asteroid and later attended Peaches' wedding. =Gavin= Gavin is a tough-as-nails and misguided dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \\"flying birds\\". =Gertie= Gertie is a posh and foxy dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \\"flying birds\\". =Roger= Roger is a freaky and cowardly young dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \\"flying birds.\\" Shangri Llama Shangri Llama is the spiritual leader of Geotopia. He is very flexible, and loves to do Yoga. His personality is very laid back, but can be easily stressed out. Teddy Teddy is a fitness-obsessed Palaeolagus at age 326 who is a resident of Geotopia. Francine Francine is a fair-and-square, high-pitched voiced Megalonyx and is Sid' ex-girlfriend. When Sid attempts to finally propose to her, she unlikely turns down his offer, leaving him confused and rejected. Neil deBuck Weasel Neil deBuck Weasel is a space astronomer weasel who lives in Buck‚Äôs mind and helps The Herd in searching for a way to stop the coming \\"extinction\\". He also acts as the narrator of the entire film and is a fourth wall breaker. Note: He is based on real live astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, who also play his voice and served as a scientific consultant for the movie. Bubbles and Misty Bubbles and Misty are \\"minicorns\\" who reside in Geotopia. Appearing in Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas=Prancer Prancer is a flying reindeer character in the special. He first appears where he saves Sid, Peaches, Crash, and Eddie during a white out. When the rest of the herd caught up, Prancer accidentally caused an avalanche which ended up destroying Santa Claus' workshop and the toys that he built. After the herd, Prancer, and the local Mini-Sloths repaired the toys and the workshop, Prancer was unable to pull Santa Claus' sleigh. This results in Prancer summoning his family to come help where they promise to help Santa Claus on Christmas. Santa Claus Santa Claus is a character in the special. Santa Claus is a magical human that brings children presents on Christmas. He has built thousands of toys and was about to deliver them when the impending avalanche caused by the characters destroyed the toys and his workshop. The herd alongside Prancer and the local Mini-Sloths were able to work to save Christmas by rebuilding the toys and Santa Claus' workshop. With the Mini-Sloths agreeing to work for Santa Claus, Prancer was able to round up his fellow reindeer in order to pull Santa Claus' sleigh. Mini-Sloths The Mini-Sloths are Christmas elves in this special. Appearing in Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade=Ethel Ethel is a female Gastornis who is among the parents that entrusted Sid to watch over her eggs. Condor Mom The Condor Mom is a female Condor who is among the parents that entrusted Sid to watch over her eggs. Clint Clint is a friendly rabbit who appears in the special. He is the twin brother of Squint and becomes the Easter Bunny. Gladys Glypto Gladys Glypto is a Glyptodon who is among the parents that entrusted Sid to watch over her egg. Cholly Bear Cholly is a chalicothere who is among the parents that entrusted Sid to watch over his egg. In his case, he adopted an egg. He previously appeared in the second film, where Manny mistook his flatulence for mammoth calls.

The term is commonly used with reference to workers who live in Mexico and cross the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border to work in the United States. However, it can also refer to workers who cross the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border or other national borders.  History  The practice of crossing the Mexico ‚Äì United States border for work developed in the late 1920s, following the passing of the 1924 Immigration Act, which substantially reduced legal immigration into the United States from Mexico. In 1970, it was estimated that approximately 70,000 people commute from Mexico to the United States every day for work, where these workers made up a significant proportion of the labor force in nine main border cities. A 1992 study by San Diego Dialogue, a research institute at the University of California, San Diego, estimated that there are 40,000 commuter workers in the San Diego area. Studies have found that cross-border workers are typically older, less well paid and less well-educated than immigrant workers. Legal Status = United States  The majority of United States cross-border commuters have permanent resident status in the United States (a 'green card') but are permitted to reside in Mexico or Canada without losing their permanent residency if they continue to regularly commute to the United States. Skilled Canadian workers in executive or managerial roles are eligible under the North American Free Trade Agreement for a temporary L-1 immigration status, that permits them to commute to jobs in the United States. Until 2019, individual workers could apply to Customs and Border Protection at a point of entry. Since early 2019 Department of Homeland Security, regulations require employers to file L-1 applications and extensions with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service.  Europe  In Europe, cross-border commuting within the European Union, by citizens of an EU country, requires no additional legal status due to the free movement of labour within the EU.

It is one kilometre long. It starts at New South Head Road and curves around the west side of Point Piper, terminating in a dead end above Lady Martins Beach. Description Wolseley Road is the most expensive residential road/street in Australia and its status stands as Australia's ultimate address, with 16 of the top 100 most expensive houses in Sydney being located on this road. Property writer Cindy Martin calculated in 2002 that the total value of the properties on the one-kilometre waterfront section of Wolseley Road was worth, in total, A$720 million. More recently, the Andrew Banks property on Wolseley Road was made an offer of $50 million, which was declined. Craig-y-Mor, a non-waterfront house on Wolseley Road and Australia's most expensive residential property, was sold in 2008 for $32.4 million. It was previously owned by Rene Rivkin who sold it to businessman Ben Tilley in 2004 for $16.15 million. The house has six bedrooms and a nine-car garage. Many of Sydney's top business people, doctors, barristers and judges reside on Wolseley Road. Housing styles Houses in the area are designed according to the limited availability and price of land, as well as the physical nature of the location. There is considerable variety because every house is unique; in contrast to many Sydney suburbs, there has been no mass development with identical houses. The range of styles goes from Federation Arts and Crafts cottages to multi-storey mansions and some towers of home units.

Originating from within the Anglican Communion, it expanded to include members from other Churches and became ecumenical in outlook. It was also international in scope with over one hundred branches throughout the world. The Guild took its name from the Book of Tobit, where Saint Raphael is the angel who helps Tobias find his way. In October 2015 the Guild merged with the Guild of Health - from which it had originally emerged - under the formal title of The Guild of Health and St. Raphael. The remainder of this article contains the text as it appeared before the merger. Information about membership and the publications Guild News and Chrism can now be found at www.gohealth.org.uk Origins and history Some Internet sources place the founding of the Guild by some of the members of the Stella Matutina, including Robert Felkin. There is little documentary evidence available to support this assertion outside of the book by Francis X. King, (1989), and he asserts that the Guild rapidly became completely separate from any of the practices of Stella Matutina. The available evidence suggests it never was connected. Recent minutes (published in Chrism, 2006) show that the driving personalities behind the foundation of the Guild in 1915 were a Miss Caroline Biggs, recorded as Secretary of the newly formed Guild, with the Reverend Canon R. P. Roseveare of St Paul's Deptford, recorded as its first Warden. By 1920, under Canon Roseveare's Wardenship, the fourth Annual Report gives the membership as 19 priest members, 26 priest associates, 2 lay members and 248 lay associates. The Guild had already penetrated into Africa, Canada, New Zealand, India and China. A letter to the Times, published in 1933 by Bishop W.W. Hough, Warden of the Guild, notes that \\"The movement has grown. There are now over 2,000 lay members, and 300 priest members who are practicing spiritual healing in most of the dioceses in the land.\\" Works Its main emphasis is on the actual practice of the healing ministry through its local branches, and this is where its strength lies. Its members observe a simple rule of prayer, study and work for this ministry. Their aim is always to promote Christ's ministry of healing - looking not just for physical healing, but for the healing of the whole person. The Guild looks too for the healing of communities and of God's creation itself - taking into account those many social and political factors which cause 'dis-ease' in our broken and divided world. Prayer for healing is at the heart of the Guild's work, as are the sacraments of healing - anointing and the sacramental act of the laying on of hands. But members make use of other healing actions as well - the ministry of listening and silence, counselling, informal liturgies and simple symbolic actions. The Guild has in the past gained a high-profile for its study and recognition of exorcism. In 1960, the Rev. Henry Cooper, Chaplain to the Guild, argued that successful exorcists are people who know something about psychiatry and work well with doctors. They resort to bell, book and candle only when psychiatrists have given up . The Guild also engages in extensive theological education and research. In particular through its periodical, Chrism, mentioned below. In this and in all its activities the Guild has always stood for the closest co- operation with members of the medical profession and others engaged in the work of healing. Periodical The Guild publishes a half-yearly periodical, Chrism, in which it endeavours to explore different aspects of the healing scene. Past editions have dealt with diverse topics such as Children and Healing, Touch in a Fearful Society, Animals and Healing, A Theology of Health for Today, M.E. (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), Dementia, Genetic Engineering and Healing, Alcohol and Substance Abuse.  Wardens  *1915 Reverend Canon R. P. Roseveare of St Paul's Deptford *1959 Reverend F. S.

McGarrett is a former United States Navy officer and the leader of a special state police task force, which is called Five-O. McGarrett was famously portrayed by Jack Lord in the original show from 1968 to 1980, and later by Alex O'Loughlin in the series' remake from 2010. Throughout the show, McGarrett is partner to Detective Danny \\"Danno\\" Williams. Hawaii Five-0 (1968‚Äì1980) In the original show, Steve McGarrett was portrayed by Jack Lord from 1968 to 1980. McGarrett was a former United States Navy Lieutenant and Detective Captain in the Honolulu Police Department who had been requested by Governor Paul Jameson to head the Five-0 Task Force, a fictional equivalent of the state police. He was portrayed as a highly driven cop and workaholic, often staying at his office until midnight. It was said that he \\"only takes orders from the Governor and God ‚Äì and occasionally even they have trouble\\". McGarrett had a sister Mary Ann (Nancy Malone). Their mother was murdered by criminals when they were young. It was revealed that this personal tragedy was what motivated McGarrett to become a police officer. Throughout the series he drives a black Mercury; a 1967 2-door Mercury Marquis hardtop with a red interior in the pilot only,http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_88376-Mercury- Marquis-1967.html followed by a 1968 4-door Mercury Park Lane Brougham hardtop,http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_174370-Mercury-Park-Lane- Brougham-1968.html then ultimately a 1974 4-door Mercury Marquis Brougham hardtop in subsequent episodes. Hawaii Five-0 (2010‚Äì2020) Australian actor Alex O'Loughlin portrays Steve McGarrett in the 2010 remake. The current incarnation bears some similarities to Jack Lord's character, such as their Navy Intelligence background and a long-standing nemesis in Wo Fat. In the pilot episode, Lieutenant Commander Steven J. \\"Steve\\" McGarrett was in South Korea on a classified mission escorting wanted arms dealer Anton Hesse when he received a call via satellite phone from his father John and finds out that Anton's brother Victor was coincidentally holding John hostage on an unrelated matter. McGarrett's convoy was attacked by a helicopter of armed men trying to rescue Anton, resulting in Anton being killed. When Victor finds out, he shoots John point blank with the younger McGarrett still on the line. McGarrett returns to Hawaii to bury his father and is asked by Governor Jameson to set up a task force with \\"full immunity and means\\" to investigate and capture criminals such as the Hesse brothers. Despite his initial hesitation, he eventually agrees and transfers to the United States Navy Reserve. He then recruits Newark PD transfer, Detective Sergeant Danny \\"Danno\\" Williams, his father's former trainee Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly and recent HPD Academy graduate Officer Kono Kalakaua. These four make up the original members of the \\"Governor's Task Force\\", later renamed \\"Five-0\\". When McGarrett assembles his task force, he partners with Williams. Background Steven John McGarrett was born in Hawaii on March 10, 1977 to John and Doris McGarrett. Since returning to Hawaii, McGarrett has lived in his childhood home at 2727 Piikoi Street along the beach, where his father continued to live in after the break-up of his family and was murdered. Although technically a haole like Danny, Steve is accepted as kama'aina as he was not only born in Hawaii, but was raised to respect and embrace the local culture. In several episodes, he is shown to be conversant in \\"bird\\" (Hawaiian Pidgin). As such, he was not antagonized as much as Danny was by the locals during the first several seasons, evidenced by his friendship with Mamo and the deference shown to him even by Kapu leader Kawika and Kamekona, who affectionately calls McGarrett \\"the big kahuna\\". Based on McGarrett's flashbacks and statements from other characters, he had a happy childhood and enjoyed spending time in the garage watching his father fix the antique 1974 Mercury Marquis. He inherited his father's passion for antique cars and occasionally drove the Marquis after fixing it up himself. He was a high school sophomore when his mother Doris was presumed to be killed in a car accident in April 1992, prompting John to send Steve and his younger sister Mary away to the mainland for their own safety. Steve was sent to boarding school while Mary went to live with John's older sister Deb. With the surfacing of crime lord Wo Fat and the theft of John's mysterious tool box after Steve's return to Hawaii, the truth behind Doris' \\"death\\" is gradually revealed; while the siblings reunite with their mother, they are still suspicious of her and consider Aunt Deb to be their maternal figure. Steve is said to be fifteen or sixteen in 1992, which roughly corresponds with the fact that he was in BUD/S in the year 2000. A star quarterback, he attended the fictional Kukui High School before being sent to the Army and Navy Academy in California for his junior and senior years after the death of his mother. This led to a decade-long period of estrangement between John and his children. In the season 6 episode \\"Ka Pohaku Kihi Pa'a / The Solid Cornerstone\\", Steve admitted that he deeply regretted not patching things up with his father when he had the chance to. Military and Five-0 McGarrett is a third-generation Navy veteran and he was named after his late grandfather, Ensign Steven McGarrett, who perished on the USS Arizona during the attacks on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. His grandfather has been referenced a number of times as the younger McGarrett had met a Japanese American internee and a retired Petty Officer, both of whom knew Ensign McGarrett when he was still alive. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy and went on to have a distinguished career. Governor Jameson once outlined his resume: \\"Annapolis, five years Naval Intelligence, six years with the SEALs. Your superiors say that you are the best they have ever seen.\\" McGarrett graduated from BUD/S Class 203 (in real life, Class 203 graduated in 1996, not the 2000s) at the top of his class. His time in the military is largely unknown or vague due to the highly classified nature of most of his missions, but it was mentioned that he has been deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and North Korea, served on board the USS Enterprise, was stationed at Coronado at some point in his career and was known by the nickname \\"Smooth Dog\\". He is multilingual and is mainly conversant in Asian languages; he understands Pashto (he did several tours in Afghanistan), speaks and reads Mandarin fluently and knows conversational Korean and Japanese. He is friends with former Navy SEAL Senior Chief Petty Officer, now NCIS Special Agent Sam Hanna from NCIS: Los Angeles and former Delta Force operative turned Phoenix Foundation agent Jack Dalton from MacGyver. Due to his background in intelligence and special ops, he is well-connected to high-ranking officials in the Navy and the CIA, which he has used to his advantage on several occasions. Prior to his father's murder, he served on a \\"black op\\" with his best friend, Freddie Hart, but the mission went south and Hart was killed; his body was not recovered until Season 3 when McGarrett personally flew to North Korea to oversee the repatriation. In season 4, he admits to Lou Grover that after Hart's death, the Navy \\"didn't feel the same\\" anymore and that he jumped at the chance to leave when Governor Jameson asked him to set up the task force. McGarrett uses the same weapons he used as a SEAL including a P226 Navy as his sidearm as well as the Heckler & Koch MP5K and MP7 sub-machine guns, and HK416 assault rifle. Besides his father's vintage Marquis, McGarrett drives a blue Chevrolet Silverado. Its license plate registration number is F6-3958, which was also used by Jack Lord's character in the original series. In \\"No Ke Ali'i' Wahine A Me Ka Aina\\", Steve and Danny, along with an MI-6 officer (Chris Vance) are awarded the George Cross by Queen Elizabeth II for stopping a terrorist attack against Europe. Characterization and relationships Despite the fact that he is no longer on full-time active duty, McGarrett's military background and SEAL training are still evident in his daily routine and habits; he still takes a \\"Navy shower\\", keeps his house impeccably neat and tidy, maintains a fitness regimen and is extremely sensitive to sound even when asleep. His military mannerisms are also apparent in the way he approaches his cases, some of the lingo he uses and his ability to remain calm even when under intense pressure, and he is frequently mocked by Danny for his lack of \\"human\\" touch. In later seasons he becomes more affable around the other task force members and would be seen cracking jokes with other team members. Despite his stoicism, he has a soft spot for children, especially his adoptive niece Joan and Danny's children Grace and Charlie, both of whom often refer to him as 'Uncle Steve', and is extremely protective of his younger sister Mary. Much of McGarrett's interaction with Danny outside of work usually begins and ends with the duo bickering over trivial matters or good-naturedly mocking one another; there is a running gag in the show where various characters would comment on how the duo bicker like an \\"old married couple\\". Although they seem like polar opposites‚Äîfor example, McGarrett keeps his house neat and tidy and keeps his emotions bottled up while Danny is shown to be a slob and often vocalizes his frustrations by ranting‚Äîthey form an unlikely friendship, with McGarrett mocking Danny in his deadpan humor several times about how the latter misses him secretly but refuses to admit it. Although he is often referred to as \\"Boss\\" by the other members of Five-0 and he is usually seen giving orders, he considers the other members of the team as his peers and ohana (family), as mentioned in the Season 5 premiere. McGarrett was in a long-term on-and-off relationship with Catherine Rollins (Michelle Borth), a rekindled old flame introduced early in season 1. In season 8, it is revealed that his romantic relationship with Catherine dates back to 2002-eight years prior to the events of the pilot. Early in season 6, she leaves on a classified CIA operation before he's able to propose to her. He begins to date Lynn (Sarah Carter) later that season. Despite his ongoing relationship with Lynn, in the season seven premiere McGarrett confesses to a fellow police officer he meets in a hospital chapel that he \\"met the right woman but couldn't hold on to her\\". In a subsequent episode later that season MI6 agent Harry Langford tells Steve that his deceased wife was \\"the only one he ever let in\\" to which McGarrett replies that he \\"got one of those\\" but has \\"no chance of getting her back\\". In the season nine premiere, it is revealed that he has broken up with Lynn. In season ten, he is seen dating multiple women before eventually admitting to Danny that he is ‚Äúfeeling lost‚Äù and used the dating as a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù. In the series finale, McGarrett laments to new friend Lincoln Cole that Catherine was ‚Äúthe one who got away‚Äù. In the final moments of the series, McGarrett is seen smiling and holding Catherine's hand as they await to depart Hawaii. McGarrett is an extremely private man who rarely shares aspects of his personal life or preferences, in contrast to Danny, who rants about anything and everything he dislikes. For example, he attempted to keep his relationship with Catherine a secret from the team for much of season 1, although Danny later stated that he knew whenever Catherine was in town from McGarrett's \\"stupid smile\\". Although used to working in a team environment, he is usually a \\"lone wolf\\" who is extremely self-reliant and has difficulty relying on others for emotional support, which was a source of concern for his Aunt Deb. Despite Danny's persistent prying, McGarrett never speaks of his military service, largely because of the classified nature of most of his missions, often brushing Danny off with \\"It's classified\\" or \\"I can neither confirm nor deny\\". He frequently displays little or no emotion in situations where Danny is extremely emotional. It is not until Season 5 that McGarrett finally explains to Danny that he was raised in a family environment where males were not encouraged to express emotion.

In particular, after performing the change of variables y_i = \\\\log(x_i) and taking the log of the objective and constraint functions, the functions f_i, i.e., the posynomials, are transformed into log-sum-exp functions, which are convex, and the functions g_i, i.e., the monomials, become affine.

The EOS 1D Mark III was announced on February 21, 2007 and is the successor of the Canon EOS-1D Mark II N and was first released in May 2007. In late 2009, the camera was succeeded by the Canon EOS-1D Mark IV. One of the main benefits of the new Mark III, over the previous models, was the added functionality of Live view, allowing users to take pictures while looking at an LCD screen. While it had the same outdated software as the older 1D series cameras, it had a much improved button layout, which is still used today. It also had improved wireless capabilities (with the optional WFT-E2 wireless adapter) over the Mark II. The new WFT-E2 was much smaller than the previous WFT-E1 for the Mark II. The new transmitter could now also connect via a USB port. This allowed the optional addition of a GPS unit and wired PC connectivity.

It has approximately 10.1 million effective pixels. A non-removable optical anti-aliasing filter is located in front of the image sensor, which also vibrates as part of an anti- dust mechanism (similar to the one used in the entry-level Canon EOS 400D). The shutter is an electronically controlled focal-plane shutter. Its maximum speed is 1/8,000 of one second. The shutter is operated by an electromagnet. The Mark III is Canon's first professional Digital SLR to include a Live View feature, usually reserved for point-and-shoot cameras. The image is displayed on an electronic screen instead of in the viewfinder alone.  Awards  The European Imaging and Sound Association (EISA) named the Canon EOS 1D Mark III the \\"European Professional Camera of the Year 2007-2008\\".  Problems  Issues about Mark III cameras were reported throughout the online photographer communities after the camera's retail launch. These relate to SERVO AF mode, to stripes within the picture, cursor navigation failure, Err 99 messages and sub par low light focus acquisition performance compared to previous models. Canon investigated a few of these issues, and some are believed to be resolved in firmware release 1.1.1, which was released in September 2007. Most significant of the issues is the autofocus (AF) issue; under certain conditions, (notably warm, bright, sunny days, conditions under which AF usually operates the best) photographer Rob Galbraith has reported poor AF performance. As of October 17, 2007, Canon technical representatives began stating the widely reported auto focus issue is suspected to be caused by an internal submirror assembly that requires replacement on most Cameras with serial numbers between 501001 and 546561 This correction has been made in production models dating to sometime shortly before the announcement of the fix. As of August 2008, some reviewers have continued to note some level of remaining problems with AF both in the EOS-1D Mark III and EOS-1Ds Mark III even after the hardware and firmware fixes noted by Canon. On March 3, 2009, Canon announced new firmware and a free AF recalibration for the 1D Mark III. Initial reports from owners who have received their camera back from the AF recalibration seem to be largely positive, although there are still some mixed results. Firmware This latest firmware available for the EOS-1D Mark III is version 1.3.2. The latest upgrades to the firmware for the Canon EOS-1D Mark III can be found on Canon's firmware download page.

Background At age five, Zuckerman began learning piano with his mother as his teacher. As a teenager and into his early 20s, he played guitar and synthesizer in heavy metal and coldwave bands. Zuckerman studied jazz and computer music at the Berklee College of Music, where he earned a bachelor's degree. He earned a master's degree at the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied modern composition with a focus on computer music and sonic art with Morton Subotnick, Mark Trayle, and Tom Erbe.  Career = Film/TV  Zuckerman began his career as a television/film composer as one half of The Track Team, a music and sound design company based in Los Angeles. He started The Track Team in 2004 with co-founder Benjamin Wynn (aka Deru). Zuckerman created the music for the critically acclaimed television series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, which won a Peabody Award in 2008. Zuckerman also composed the music for the Avatar sequel series, The Legend of Korra, and is set to compose the score for Netflix's upcoming live-action Avatar series. Zuckerman's music is also featured in DC's The Spectre, Jonah Hex, Green Arrow, and Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam. Together, Zuckerman and Wynn created the music for the feature films Just Peck and A Leading Man, and the Nickelodeon TV series Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. In 2017, after two Emmy Award wins and five nominations, Zuckerman and Wynn announced the dissolution of The Track Team to pursue their creative and professional paths independently. Zuckerman went on to score both seasons of MTV's Scream: the TV Series, and the show's third season, acquired by VH1, Scream: Resurrection, as well as the PBS documentaries Nature: Snow Monkeys and Nature: Yosemite. Other documentaries include Beartrek, Stuntman, and This Little Land of Mines. Most recently Zuckerman, along with Josiah Steinbrick, composed the score for the new Jeff Baena film Horse Girl.  The Echo Society/Concert Music  Zuckerman is a founding member of The Echo Society, a Los Angeles-based collective whose mission is to gather, inspire, enrich and connect the community through the creation and performance of new sonic and visual art. The Echo Society's other founding members include composers Brendan Angelides (aka Eskmo), Judson Crane, Nathan Johnson, Rob Simonsen, Joseph Trapanese, and Benjamin Wynn. Zuckerman's music for The Echo Society concert series is predominantly chamber music, and the work ‚Äúfocuses on creating highly specific and controlled masses of sound using a combination of home-grown, semi- algorithmic processes and intuition. Using traditional orchestral instruments, these works explore complexity and transformation of sound and form, instead of the traditional melody/harmony paradigm.‚Äù  Modern Dance  Zuckerman has worked with choreographer Benjamin Levy on Everyone, Intimate, Alone, Visibly, ‚Äúin which extended vocal techniques performed and processed in real- time by Jeremy, intersect with Levy‚Äôs choreography to form a complex gestural dialog.‚Äù He also worked with Levy on Khaos, which was commissioned by the Scottish Dance Theatre. Zuckerman created the score for dancer/choreographer Lisa Wahlander's The Impermanent Sky, which was composed and performed live by Zuckerman using the audio programming language SuperCollider.  Theatre  Zuckerman composed the music to playwright Juli Crockett's theatre pieces [or, the whale], a spoken word opera which debuted in Los Angeles in 2001, and Orpheus Crawling, an experimental opera which premiered in 2007 at the New Original Works (NOW) Fest at REDCAT.

This is, in particular, true for any closed subspace M of H. In that case, a necessary and sufficient condition for y is that the vector x-y be orthogonal to M. Proof :* Let us show the existence of y: Let Œ¥ be the distance between x and C, (yn) a sequence in C such that the distance squared between x and yn is below or equal to Œ¥2 \\\\+ 1/n. Let n and m be two integers, then the following equalities are true: : \\\\ y_n - y_m \\\\^2 = \\\\y_n -x\\\\^2 + \\\\y_m -x\\\\^2 - 2 \\\\langle y_n - x \\\\, , \\\\, y_m - x\\\\rangle and : 4 \\\\left\\\\ \\\\frac{y_n + y_m}2 -x \\\\right\\\\^2 = \\\\y_n -x\\\\^2 + \\\\y_m -x\\\\^2 + 2 \\\\langle y_n - x \\\\, , \\\\, y_m - x\\\\rangle We have therefore: : \\\\ y_n - y_m \\\\^2 = 2\\\\y_n -x\\\\^2 + 2\\\\y_m -x\\\\^2 - 4\\\\left\\\\ \\\\frac{y_n + y_m}2 -x \\\\right\\\\^2 (Recall the formula for the median in a triangle - Median_(geometry)#Formulas_involving_the_medians'_lengths) By giving an upper bound to the first two terms of the equality and by noticing that the middle of yn and ym belong to C and has therefore a distance greater than or equal to Œ¥ from x, one gets : : \\\\ y_n - y_m \\\\^2 \\\\; \\\\le \\\\; 2\\\\left(\\\\delta^2 + \\\\frac 1n\\\\right) + 2\\\\left(\\\\delta^2 + \\\\frac 1m\\\\right) - 4\\\\delta^2=2\\\\left( \\\\frac 1n + \\\\frac 1m\\\\right) The last inequality proves that (yn) is a Cauchy sequence. Since C is complete, the sequence is therefore convergent to a point y in C, whose distance from x is minimal. :* Let us show the uniqueness of y : Let y1 and y2 be two minimizers. Then: : \\\\ y_2 - y_1 \\\\^2 = 2\\\\y_1 -x\\\\^2 + 2\\\\y_2 -x\\\\^2 - 4\\\\left\\\\ \\\\frac{y_1 + y_2}2 -x \\\\right\\\\^2 Since \\\\frac{y_1 + y_2}2 belongs to C, we have \\\\left\\\\ \\\\frac{y_1 + y_2}2 -x \\\\right\\\\^2\\\\geq \\\\delta^2 and therefore : \\\\ y_2 - y_1 \\\\^2 \\\\leq 2\\\\delta^2 + 2\\\\delta^2 - 4\\\\delta^2=0 \\\\, Hence y_1=y_2, which proves uniqueness. :* Let us show the equivalent condition on y when C = M is a closed subspace. The condition is sufficient: Let z\\\\in M such that \\\\langle z-x, a \\\\rangle=0 for all a\\\\in M. \\\\x-a\\\\^2=\\\\z-x\\\\^2+\\\\a-z\\\\^2+2\\\\langle z-x, a-z \\\\rangle=\\\\z-x\\\\^2+\\\\a-z\\\\^2 which proves that z is a minimizer. The condition is necessary: Let y\\\\in M be the minimizer. Let a\\\\in M and t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R. : \\\\(y+t a)-x\\\\^2-\\\\y-x\\\\^2=2t\\\\langle y-x,a\\\\rangle+t^2 \\\\a\\\\^2=2t\\\\langle y-x,a\\\\rangle+O(t^2) is always non-negative. Therefore, \\\\langle y-x,a\\\\rangle=0. QED References * Walter Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis. Third Edition, 1987.

He came from a long line of executioners named Desfourneaux stretching back many hundreds of years . Like all French executioners since 1792 his method of application of the death penalty was beheading by guillotine. Desfourneaux was recruited by his predecessor Anatole Deibler and attended his first execution as second assistant in 1909.See 1 Following the death of Deibler in 1939 - the latter having died of a heart attack in a Metro station while en route to his 401st execution - he was elected chief and was in charge of the last public execution in France on June 17, 1939, when he guillotined the five-time murderer Eug√®ne Weidmann. This execution was also notable as it is one of the few ever filmed, having been shot from a private apartment near the prison. About Weidmann's execution on ExecutedToday.com, June 17, 2010 For reasons unknown, Desfourneaux insisted that Greenwich rather than summertime dawn should be the official hour. This meant that contrary to custom, Weidmann was executed in broad daylight.Eugen Weidmann on the website Murder Revisited, June 26, 2005 This, combined with the public revelry around the jail (cafes were given an all-night licence extension, wine flowed and jazz blared on radios) and the filmed evidence, was largely responsible for the government's decision to hold all future executions behind closed doors. About Weidmann's execution on ExecutedToday.com, June 17, 2010 Desfourneaux was involved in further controversy during World War II when required by the Vichy Government to execute communists and members of the French Resistance, notably Marcel Langer, which led to the resignation of his assistants, Andr√© Obrecht, who was his cousin, and the Martin brothers, Georges and Robert. He was also responsible for the first guillotining of women since the late 19th century, including, famously, an abortionist named Marie-Louise Giraud in 1943.Boisdejustice.com He put to death the axe-killer Germaine Godefroy, the last woman executed in France,New York Times, August 2, 1985 on April 21, 1949. Escaping retribution after the war, Desfourneaux increasingly turned to drink, a problem compounded by the suicide of his son. He was rejoined as first assistant in 1945 by Obrecht, who, despite his increasing dislike of Desfourneaux, could see a potential future as chief executioner looming.See 1 Further disagreements followed and Obrecht resigned for the second time in 1947. Desfourneaux continued working until October 1951 when, whilst still in office and almost insane, he died. His eventual successor was Obrecht, who officiated until 1976, one year before the last execution in France; the death penalty was abolished in 1981. ReferencesSources * Flanner, Janet.

The story, set on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, focuses on 21-year-old Amanda Derington who, against her strict uncle Oswin's wishes, decides to have a holiday on the beautiful island. However, whilst on a boat to the island, she witnesses the murder of one of the passengers. But the longer she spends on Cyprus, the more she gets the feeling that she was the intended victim. Amanda Derington is staying in Egypt with her aunt and uncle; against her guardian's wishes she travels to Cyprus by ferry to see the island. Her aunt arranges for her to stay with an elderly female member of the British expatriate community who turns out to be eccentric, charming and insightful. On the ferry Amanda meets Steve for the first time and a murder occurs in which they are both involved. Once on Cyprus Steve and Amanda see a lot of each other despite her thinking him attractive but rude (and knowing he would be completely unacceptable to her guardian) and he saying that her presence was distracting him. Steve appears to be an artist and he can certainly draw but there is some mystery about him.

It could be carried by almost all German bomber aircraft, and was used to notable effect by the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka (Sturzkampfflugzeug or dive-bomber). The bomb's weight was about 250 kg, from which its designation was derived. It was used in the Eastern Front and many other theatres, and was feared for its destructive power. The SC 250 was one of the most commonly used bombs in World War II and was deployed extensively during the Blitz on London. Design The bomb consisted of two or three sections, depending on the grade of the bomb; in the grade (G√ºteklasse) I bombs, the nose cone and the bomb body were forged out of a single piece of high quality alloyed steel or the nose was welded to the body; these bombs were of the highest mechanical strength and they were meant to be used against robust targets necessitating penetration before detonation of the bomb, or as \\"Stabos\\" (\\"spike bombs\\"). The grade II and grade III bombs were made of separate nose cone, main body and aft cone parts welded together; the mechanical strength of the grade II bombs was approximately 80% of the grade I, in the grade III bombs, the mechanical strength on impact was ca. 40% of that of grade I bombs; these bombs were therefore meant to be used only on targets where instantaneous detonation on impact was necessary. After forging the body or welding the nose cone and the aft cone to the body, this was loaded with the exploder tube, the fuze pocket and then the main filling. Thereafter the body was sealed with the base plate, and the four-finned tail was attached. With an overall weight of (245‚Äì256 kg) the bomb itself was long, including the tail, and in diameter. There were many fillings, all weighing ca. (125‚Äì130 kg): * Cast Trotyl (German code \\"14\\" or \\"Fp. 02\\"), * Cast Fp. 60/40 (amatol containing 60% Trotyl, codename \\"13\\"). * Cast Fp. 50/50 (amatol with 50% Trotyl, codename \\"13A\\"). * Cast amatol 39 (50% 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 35% ammonium nitrate, 15% hexogen, codename \\"52\\"), cast amatol 40 (50% 2,4-dinitroanisole, 35% ammonium nitrate, 15% hexogen, codename \\"17\\"). * Cast amatol 41 (52% ammonium nitrate, 6% calcium nitrate, 30% ethylenediamine dinitrate, 10% hexogen, 2% montan wax, codename \\"88\\"). * Pressed ammonal D (90% ammonium nitrate, 5% naphthalene, 2.5% wood meal and 2.5% aluminium powder, codename \\"110\\"). * Pressed ammonal DJ (70% ammonium nitrate, 20% trotyl, 10% aluminium powder, codename \\"113\\"). * Pressed ammonal DJ1 (76% ammonium nitrate, 20% trotyl, 4% coarse aluminium powder, codename \\"114\\"). * Cast Trialen 105 (70% Trotyl, 15% hexogen, 15% aluminium powder, codename \\"105\\"). Bombs filled with Trialen 105 were to be used especially as water bombs/depth charges against enemy shipping and submarines, however the Trialen bombs could be used to a great effect against land targets as well.Fleischer, W.: Deutsche Abwurfmunition bis 1945.

Built in 1831 on the north side of Fifth Street between Broadway and Sycamore (), it was a simple red brick Georgian structure copied after John Wesley's original Methodist church in London. With 1,200 seats, it was the largest meeting place west of the Alleghenies and the largest building in Cincinnati for many years. It was the seat of Methodism in Cincinnati. The funeral of William Henry Harrison took place there in 1841. In 1845, former president John Quincy Adams spoke at Wesley Chapel, dedicating the new Cincinnati Observatory being built on Mount Adams. In the years before the Civil War, political rallies and anti- slavery meetings frequently were held there. During the early years, a cemetery was near the Chapel on Fifth Street; when the Wesleyan Cemetery, was founded in 1843 many of the bodies were moved to the new cemetery. A long struggle took place between 1965 and 1972 between the Procter & Gamble Corporation and the people who wanted to save the oldest surviving church in the city, Wesley Chapel.

Scientific Theology is also the \\"running title\\" of the project which gave rise to the trilogy. The work is preceded by three volumes that McGrath describes as \\"landmarks\\" in the development of his scientific theology: The Genesis of Doctrine: A Study in the Foundations of Doctrinal Criticism, The Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion and Thomas F. Torrance: An Intellectual Biography.Scientific Theology , Alister McGrath The trilogy was later summarised in The Science of God. McGrath is working on a \\"scientific dogmatics\\" which will deal with the content of Christian theology following the method developed in the trilogy.McGrath (2001-c) p.297 The concept of \\"scientific theology\\"=Overview Since at least the time of the 2nd century apologistsGrant, Robert McQueen. Greek Apologists of the Second Century. London: SCM Press, 1988. Christian theology has sought to relate itself to major intellectual trends. In earlier periods this meant engagement with Platonism and Aristotelianism. But as these philosophical systems waned under the increasing influence of natural philosophy (later \\"science\\") so Christian theology increasingly tended to focus on engagement with the natural sciences.Ferngren, Gary B, ed. Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. This engagement would eventually lead to the idea that Christian Theology itself should be \\"scientific\\" and by the earlier part of the 20th century calls were being made for a \\"scientific theology.\\"See, for example; This call has been answered in various ways.See particularly These various approaches to \\"scientific theology\\" may be loosely categorised as \\"methodological\\" or \\"doctrinal\\" depending upon their primary focus. These concerns, however, are by no means mutually exclusive. A \\"methodological\\" approach is concerned with practicing theology in a \\"scientific\\" manner and focuses on clearly articulating the assumptions, methods, and related thought-forms to be taken into account in the construction of dogmatic formulations. A \\"doctrinal\\" approach is concerned with the inter-relationship of scientific and doctrinal content and focuses on formulating Christian theology against a framework of specific scientific theorems. McGrath's approach to \\"scientific theology\\" By a ‚Äúscientific theology‚Äù McGrath does not mean an attempt to reconcile particular Christian beliefs with particular scientific theorems. Such efforts are regarded by him as pointless because they become outdated with scientific progress.McGrath (2004), pp.27-31 Rather, McGrath seeks to draw upon the proven assumptions and methods of the natural sciences in order to inform the practice of Christian theology.McGrath (2001-a), p.48. cf. McGrath (2001-b), pp.165-6 Such an approach is grounded in the fundamental belief that Christian theology seeks to describe the same God who (in whatever way) created the natural order which the natural sciences seek to describe.McGrath (2001-b), p.227 The assumption is that a theological investigation of reality can be informed by the approach taken in a scientific investigation of reality.McGrath, (2004), p.22 It is critical to distinguish levels of reality so that each level is investigated according to its appropriate methods.McGrath (2001-b), pp.219-26, p.227. McGrath (2004), p.22, pp.27-31 On this basis, the reality of God and the contingent reality of the created order are taken as distinct although still related levels of reality. It is important to note that this is not regarded as a self-evident truth, but acknowledged to be a claim of Christian theology which is based in revelation.For a discussion of the nature and place of revelation in a scientific theology see McGrath (2004), pp.209-10, pp.219-221 It is the Christian understanding of revelation as disclosure of an objective reality that justifies, in McGrath's view, claims of a correspondence between the assumptions and methods of Christian theology and those of the natural sciences. He argues that just as the natural sciences are an investigation of the objective reality of the natural order, so Christian theology is an investigation of the (revealed) objective reality of God.McGrath (2001-b), pp.247-249 Christian theology and the natural sciences, therefore, are both a response to reality and so must proceed a posteriori-that is from observations (i.e. of revealed or natural data respectively) to dogmas/theorems.McGrath (2001-b), pp.123-124, pp.272-77 Ideally, neither discipline confuses its theoretical constructs with the reality it seeks to describe. Both should be critical of their dogmas/theorems and constantly put them to the test. For Christian theology this means continually assessing Christian faith and practice against the revelation of God in Jesus Christ ‚Äúthe incarnate word.‚ÄùMcGrath (2001-b), p.227, pp.297-313 In this work McGrath commits himself to an approach that seeks to avoid the use of contemporary views of religion as found in the work of the distinguished Ian Barbour and Arthur Peacocke, keeping instead to a classic Christian theological formulation (i.e., traditional credal Christian orthodoxy), which is a position closer to John Polkinghorne according to McGrath.\\"The Approach to Be Adopted\\" (pp.35-38). A Scientific Theology (Volume 1): Nature. Also when relating Christianity and science, the three volumes stress the provisionality(italics are those of McGrath's from p. 47 of Nature (Volume 1)) of scientific understanding, findings, and conclusions.A Scientific Theology: Nature (p.45) A Scientific Theology: Nature (p.47) A Scientific Theology: Reality (p.166) This sort of provisionality makes relating Christianity to science very different from relating Christianity to fairly settled views such as Platonism and Aristotelianism.A Scientific Theology: Nature (p.45) Rationale Commenting that \\"[w]riting on method is a bit like clearing your throat before beginning a lecture. You can only go on so long before the audience starts to get a little restless.\\" McGrath makes clear that the methodological concerns of A Scientific Theology constitute an extensive preliminary to the development of a systematic theology constructed according to the trilogy's methodological grounds.McGrath (2001-c), p.296 A Scientific Theology is intended by McGrath to be ecumenical in approach and valuable to Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and evangelical readers.\\"The specific form of scientific theology which this project advocates is based upon the affirmation of the intellectual resilience of traditional credal Christian orthodoxy, whose fundamental ideas are stated in the classic creeds of Christianity, and defended as living experienced realities by the great traditions of Christian theology - Catholicism, Orthodoxy and evangelicalism.\\" (McGrath (2001-a), p.35) Due to both McGrath's creedal commitments, A Scientific Theology is \\"a systematic work of theology\\".McGrath (2001-a), p.xix), emphasis added Due precisely to the scope of the work, McGrath felt led to prepare a short volume The Science of God which \\"is designed to introduce the distinctive themes and emphasis of this scientific theology to a wider readership\\"Alister McGrath, The Science of God, (London: T&T; Clark, 2004), p.x In intent, the trilogy is a very ambitious project which seeks to lay a methodological groundwork for further theological reflection. In execution, McGrath himself acknowledges that it falls somewhat short of its goal. Writing in the conclusion to the third volume he explains; Other Works of Relevance to the Scientific Theology Project The three volumes of A Scientific Theology form part of a broader project which has issued in a number of other books by McGrath. The contents of these books, and their relation to the scientific theology project, are briefly described in this section. The Science of God (2004) The Science of God is a small book prepared by McGrath to introduce the themes and emphases of A Scientific Theology to a wider readership.For a brief discussion see McGrath (2004), pp.x-xii Four considerations guided its preparation; #Level: is less academic, assuming less about the reader's background knowledge in science, theology and philosophy. #Style: is popular rather than scholarly, with new sections prepared with a different audience in mind. #Length: is greatly reduced with many scholarly footnotes and extended discussions omitted. #Case Studies: in historical science and theology are no longer discussed in detail. Rather they are briefly noted and their relevance explained. Fleming, noting the impact of McGrath's project, describes The Science of God as \\"an accessible place to begin following what is likely to become one of the most influential areas in the science-religion dialogue.\\"Fleming, Fraser F., review of Alister E.

Vol. 96, No. 1. Mar., 2005. pp. 157-158 amongst others. Volume 1: Nature William B. Eerdmans, 2001) Willem B. Drees, Leiden University, The Netherlands, offered a lengthy review of Volume 1: Nature in which he followed a summary of the work with a solid critique. There are three points at which Drees critiques McGrath throughout the review; *Theological Commitments: Drees is critical of McGrath's focus on Christianity specifically rather than religion generally because although ‚Äúdefining religion(s) may be highly difficult...such difficulties are no excuse to dismiss the challenge of alternative worldviews or ways of being in the world.‚Äù Here, McGrath's ‚ÄòChristian Orthodox‚Äô theological orientation is seen as too narrow - it ‚Äúworks well for those who stand within a particular tradition‚Äù but it ‚Äúcommunicates less convincingly with outsiders, or the potential outsider within the churches‚Äù - as well as somewhat artificial - is it ‚Äúsufficiently coherent to count as a well defined position?‚Äù Furthermore, Drees suggests, McGrath's orthodoxy ‚Äúcovers up tensions‚Äù between Evangelical and Roman Catholic approaches in particular. McGrath's critique (and hence rejection) of the ‚Äútransient‚Äù theologies of an earlier generation is turned back upon McGrath's own conservative position which ‚Äúmight be transient as well; ‚Äúwhatever it is, transience is not an argument.‚Äù McGrath's appeal to ‚ÄòScripture‚Äô as normative is judged na√Øve and ‚ÄúMcGrath‚Äôs problem awareness with respect to appeals to ‚Äònature‚Äô is not matched by a similar care in his appeals to Scripture.‚Äù Although McGrath allows for dynamic in the ‚Äòreception of doctrine‚Äô this leaves unanswered the question as to which modifications are legitimate and which are not. *Method vs Content: Given that McGrath's primary interest is avowedly methodological, Drees finds ‚Äúsomewhat surprising‚Äù that he offers criticism of those whose interests are primarily in the content of science (e.g. Ian Barbour, Arthur Peacocke) rather than engaging with those contemporary writers who focus primarily on method (e.g. Philip Clayton, Nancey Murphy, Mikael Stenmark, J. Wentzel van Huyssten). The idea that method is unchanging whilst content is highly provisional is criticised. In respects of the content of science Drees suggests that a threefold distinction between the increasingly provisional ‚Äúconsolidated knowledge,‚Äù ‚Äúcurrent research,‚Äù and ‚Äúspeculative reaches‚Äù of science would be helpful. In respects of the methods of science, Drees rejects a claim of stasis arguing that history shows that ‚Äúideas about method have changed as well.‚Äù On the content of scientific knowledge Drees remarks that \\"Even though knowledge is in principle provisional, it seems unlikely that we will ever get rid of a spherical Earth, the Periodic Table, the million year long time scales of biologists and geologists, or the insight that humans are evolutionary close relatives of chimps and bonobo‚Äôs. Science is open ended in metaphysics, but consolidated in many substantial domains of knowledge.\\" McGrath's criticism of theologies grounded in the content of the natural sciences‚Äù is thus misplaced at two levels. First, grounding theology in science is not, in fact, what others in the field (Peacocke, Barbour) are doing. Second, a theology which avoids all engagement with the consolidated findings of contemporary science risks irrelevance. *Accuracy of representation of opposing views: McGrath's claim that process theology (under the influence of Barbour) has become almost the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù position is seen as curious given the widespread criticism of process theology by major thinkers associated with major institutions (Oxford, Cambridge, Berkley, the Zygon centre). Dree's responds to McGrath's critique of his own work strongly. Noting that he has already offered reply to one of McGrath's primary sources (Griffin, Religion and Scientific Naturalism, 1996), Drees acknowledges certain of McGrath's criticisms in relation to his own ‚Äúpurely naturalistic approach to religion‚Äù but objects to McGrath's citation of his claim that ‚Äúa completely independent justification of naturalism is impossible‚Äù without citing the preceding passage which qualifies this remark. Citing further issues with McGrath's engagement with his own work, Drees concludes that ‚Äúgiven his theological interest, McGrath is right to disagree with me, but accurate analysis and criticism ‚Äì of my writings and those of various others ‚Äì is not the strength of his book.‚Äù Drees concludes; ‚ÄúMcGrath‚Äôs book is rich in historical detail and in footnotes (I wish they had been covered by the index as well) and very outspoken in its judgments ‚Ä¶ [but] I find the book falling short in the accuracy with which it deals with other positions and with complex issues such as the philosophical arguments pro and contra scientific realism...and theological realism.‚ÄùWillem B. Drees, Review of A Scientific Theology, Volume 1: Nature in Ars Disputandi: The Online Journal for Philosophy of Religion 2(2002) Larry L. Rasmussen, Reinhold Niebuhr Emeritus Professor of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary, considered A Scientific Theology: Volume 1, Nature to be ‚Äúimmensely learned and instructive.‚Äù After giving a brief summary of the volume's themes and contents he concludes that McGrath is \\"in full command of the English and German language sources within what he calls 'the western intellectual community.'\\" However, Rasmussen finds ‚Äúunsettling‚Äù McGrath's failure to move outside that community to engage with recent Christian sources ‚Äì feminist and Two-Thirds World in particular ‚Äì which in recent decades have challenged both McGrath's streams of theology, and the epistemologies and philosophy of science. Thus, although McGrath sees his project as ‚Äúa public theology,‚Äù Rasmussen considers that this ‚Äúdoes not mean engagement with voices that dissent from his canon.‚Äù He concludes: ‚ÄúGiven the ferment in both theology and science...this is an unfortunate omission in an otherwise learned undertaking.‚Äù Gregory Snyder in the Anglican Theological Review considered Volume 1 \\"a magisterial historical, philosophical, theological, and biblical treatise on \\"nature.\\" By its end, I felt as if I had completed a seminary course in natural theology. It is well written, erudite, at times even provocative, and humorous. However, it is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a book to consume slowly and savor in one's study, notepad in hand.\\" Volume 2: RealityVolume 3: Theory=Notes References   External links * McGrath, Alister, A Scientific Theology?

This geosynthetic clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a leak detection system composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner.Composite liners improve landfill performance. (1997). Civil Engineering (08857024), 67(12), 18. The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants.Rowe, R., & Rimal, S. S. (2008). Depletion of Antioxidants from an HDPE Geomembrane in a Composite Liner. Journal of Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering, 134(1), 68-78. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:1(68) It can be used as a substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and liquid barrier. The geosynthetic clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium bentonite is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste.Scalia, J., & Benson, C. H. (2011). Hydraulic Conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners Exhumed from Landfill Final Covers with Composite Barriers. Journal of Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering, 137(1), 1-13. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000407 The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and geosynthetic liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover. How it works The main role a composite liner has for a municipal solid waste system for landfills is that is reduces the amount of leakage through small seep holes that sometimes form in the geomembrane part of the composite liner. The protection layer part serves as a preventer from these holes from forming inside the geomembrane which would allow the waste to leak through the entire liner. It also takes away the pressure and stress which can cause cracking and holes from forming in the membrane as well.Dickinson, S. S., & Brachman, R. I. (2008). Assessment of alternative protection layers for a geomembrane ‚Äì geosynthetic clay liner (GM‚ÄìGCL) composite liner. Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 45(11), 1594-1610. An effective liner in a landfill system should be able to control water in terms of movement and protection on the environment. It should be able to regulate the flow away from the waste area and withhold the waste contents as it enters the actual landfill. Due to the effectiveness on how landfills are placed on top of slopes in order for the water to stream downhill and in an emergency, into the actual landfill. Water moves through the landfill and downward through the composite liner. The main purpose for all of this is so that the movement is lateral which lessens the probability for slope catastrophe and the waste leaking down and freely contaminating whatever is in its path. The final cover functions as a way to keep the water out of the contaminate and to control the runoff from entering the system. This helps prevent plants and animals from being harmed by the waste contaminated water, leachate. Using gravity and pumps the leachate is able to be pushed to a sump where it is removed by a pump. When developing composite liners it is extremely important to take in risk factors such as earthquakes and other slope failure problems that could occur. Composite liners are used in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills to reduce water pollution. A composite liner is made of a geomembrane along with a geosynthetic clay liner. Composite-liner systems are better at reducing leachate migration into the subsoil than either a clay liner or a single geomembrane layer.  Mechanical properties  The primary forms of mechanical degradation associated with geomembranes result from insufficient tensile strength, tear resistance, impact resistance, puncture resistance, and susceptibility to environmental stress cracking (ESC). The ideal method of assessing the amount of liner degradation would be by examining field samples over their service life. Due to the lengths of time required for field sampling tests, various laboratory-accelerated ageing tests have been developed to measure the important mechanical properties.Rowe, R. Kerry, S Rimal, and S Rimal. 2008. Aging of HDPE Geomembrane in Three Composite Landfill Liner Configurations. Journal of Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134, no. 7: 906-916.  Tensile strength  Tensile strength represents the ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition at the edges of the sample.Wesseloo, J, AT Visser, and E Rust. 2004. A Mathematical Model for the Strain-rate Dependent Stress-strain Response of HDPE Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 22, no. 4: 273-295. A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245 lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325 lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.Sharma, Hari and Reddy, Krishna. 2004. Geoenvironmental Engineering: Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey.  Tear resistance  Tear resistance of a geomembrane becomes important when it is exposed to high winds or handling stress during installation. There are various ASTM methods for measuring tear resistance of geomembranes, with most common reports using ASTM D1004. Typical tear resistances show a value of 40 to 45 lb for 60-mil HDPE and 50 to 60 lb for 80-mil HDPE.  Impact resistance  Impact resistance provides an assessment of the effects of impacts from falling objects which can either tear or weaken the geomembrane. As with the previous mechanical properties, there are various ASTM methods for assessment. Significantly higher impact resistances are realized when geotextiles are placed above or below the geomembrane. Thicker geomembranes also display higher impact resistances.  Puncture resistance  Puncture resistance of a geomembrane is important due to the heterogeneous material above and below a typical liner. Rough surfaces, such as stones or other sharp objects, may puncture a membrane if it does not have sufficient puncture resistance. Various methods beyond standard ASTM tests are available; one such method, the critical cone height test, measures the maximum height of a cone on which a compressed geomembrane, which is subjected to increasing pressure, does not fail. HDPE samples typically have a critical cone height of around 1 cm.Kolbasuk, G. 1991. Coextruded Hdpe Vldpe Multilayer Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 10, no. 5-6: 601-612.  Environmental stress cracking  Environmental stress cracking is defined as external or internal cracking in plastic induced by applied tensile stress less than its short-term tensile strength. ESC is a fairly common observation in HDPE geomembranes and thus needs to be evaluated carefully. Proper polymeric properties, such as molecular weight, orientation, and distribution, aid in ESC resistance. ASTM D5397 [standard test method for evaluation of stress crack resistance of polyolefin geomembranes using notched constant tensile load (NCTL)] provides the necessary procedure for measuring the ESC resistance of most HDPE geomembranes. The current recommended transition time for an acceptable HDPE geomembrane is around 100 h.

The ski area lies about south of the summit of Mount Shasta, the second highest volcano in the Cascade Range behind Mt. Rainier. It straddles several small volcanic buttes on the lower southern flanks of the massive stratovolcano, with 3 triple chairlifts running to the top of Coyote Butte- , Douglas Butte- , and Marmot Ridge- . Along with 2 magic carpets, one for tubing and one for learning to ski and snowboard. With a total skiable area of 425 acres and 32 conventional trails. The total skiable vertical is , with 20% of the terrain rated beginner, 55% intermediate, and 25% advanced. History The Ski Park was the second ski area constructed on Mount Shasta, but the only one which now survives. The old Mount Shasta Ski Bowl had been built in 1958 in a huge open cirque much higher up on the southern flank of the volcano, with a lodge at and lifts topping out above timberline at . However, the ski area had often been in financial trouble over the next two decades, and a massive avalanche in January 1978 which destroyed the main chairlift was the finishing blow. The Ski Bowl closed permanently after that, and there was no more lift-served skiing on Mount Shasta until 1985, when local businessmen and developers finally began construction of a new ski area lower down on the mountain, in an area well below timberline and safe from avalanches. Starting with Marmot Ridge and Douglas Butte chairlifts. Then later the Coyote Butte lift. The Mount Shasta Ski Park opened on December 14, 1985, and has been successfully operating for close to three and a half decades since then.

The belief that a new prophet cannot arise after Muhammad is shared by both Sunni and Shi'i Muslims. Some of the most prominent historical Sunni texts on creed (aqidah) explicitly mention the doctrine of finality of prophethood. For example, in al-Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah it is asserted that \\"Every claim to the prophetic office after his is a delusion and a wandering desire.\\" In another popular work, al-Aqidah an-Nasafiyyah, it is stated, \\"The first of the prophets is Adam and the last is Muhammad.\\" Academic views Hartwig Hirschfeld doubted the authenticity of the verse 33:40 and claimed it to be of late origin. Cited by Friedmann. Yohanan Friedmann states that Hirschfeld's arguments \\"that the title khatam an-nabiyyin is unusual, that it only appears once in the Qur'an, that the word khatam is not Arabic‚Ä¶do not seem valid arguments against the authenticity of the verse.\\" Frants Buhl accepted the traditional meaning of last prophet. Cited by Friedmann. Josef Horovitz suggested two possible interpretations of khatam an-nabiyyin: the last prophet or the one who confirms the authenticity of the previous prophets. Cited by Friedmann. Heinrich Speyer agreed with Horovitz. Cited by Friedmann. According to Alford T. Welch, the traditional Muslim belief that Muhammad is \\"last and greatest of the prophets\\" is most likely based on a later interpretation of 33:40. The first modern academic to have studied in detail the history of the doctrine of finality of prophethood is Yohanan Friedmann. In his seminal article, Finality of Prophethood in Sunni Islam (1986), he concluded that although the notion of finality of prophethood \\"eventually acquired an undisputed and central place in the religious thought of Islam,\\" it was contested during the first century AH. He states, \\"While it is true that the phrase khatam an-nabiyyin is generally interpreted as meaning 'the last prophet', the exegetical tradition and other branches of classical Arabic literature preserved material which indicates that this now generally received understanding of the Qur'anic phrase is not the only possible one and had not necessarily been the earliest.\\" Due to this Friedmann states that the meaning of khatam an-nabiyyin in its original Qur'anic context is still in doubt. Wilferd Madelung takes Friedmann's findings into consideration in observing that the original Qur'anic meaning of the term is not entirely certain. However, in a more recent paper he states, \\"Most Muslims at the time no doubt understood it to mean that he was to be the last prophet and Islam was the final religion, as Muslims have commonly understood it ever since.\\" An edited version of an article that originally appeared in the Proceedings of the 25th Congress of L‚ÄôUnion Europ√©enne des Arabisants et Islamisants in 2013. Carl W. Ernst considers the phrase to mean that Muhammad's \\"imprint on history is as final as a wax seal on a letter.\\" David Powers, also making use of Friedmann's research, believes that the early Muslim community was divided over the meaning of the expression, with some understanding it to mean he fulfilled or confirmed the earlier Christian and Jewish revelations, while others understood it as signifying that Muhammad brought the office of prophethood to a close. He suggests that the Qur'anic text underwent a series of secondary omissions and additions which were designed to adapt the text to the dogma of finality of prophethood, and that the idea of finality only became the prevailing interpretation (alongside the notion of confirmation or fulfilment) by the end of the 1st century AH / 7th century. In a review of Powers' book, Gerald Hawting goes further, suggesting that the development of the doctrine was not complete before the 3rd century AH / 9th century. Madelung comments that Power's argument, that verses 36-40 are a later addition dating from the generation after Muhammad's death, is \\"hardly sustainable.\\" Uri Rubin holds that the finality of prophethood is a Qur'anic idea, not a post-Qur'anic one, and that the expression khatam an-nabiyyin implies both finality of prophethood and confirmation. In response to Powers and other modern scholars sceptical of the early origin of the doctrine, Rubin concludes from his study \\"that, at least as far as Sura 33 is concerned, the consonantal structure of the Qur'anic text has not been tampered with, and that the idea of finality of prophethood is well-represented in the text, as well as in the earliest available extra-Quranic materials.\\" Rubin reexamines the early extra-Qur'anic texts cited by Friedmann and other modern scholars, and concludes that rather than indicating that the notion of finality of prophethood is late, the texts confirm the early origin of the belief. He concludes that \\"there is no compelling reason to assume that the Muslims of the first Islamic century originally understood the Qur'anic khatam an- nabiyyin in the sense of confirmation alone, without that of finality.\\"  Official usage  On 22 June 2020, the Government of Pakistan made it mandatory that term () be added to the name Muhammad (relating to the Prophet of Islam) in textbooks and official documents where previously it was passed on 15 June in the Sindh Assembly. Similarly, the Khatumo administration based in Buuhoodle and centred on the Sool, central Sanaag and Ayn regions of northern Somalia, claims its title is derived from the Quranic injunction of Khatam an-Nabiyyin.Stremlau, Nicole. \\"Governance without Government in the Somali territories.\\" Journal of International Affairs 71.2 (2018): 73-89. Ahmadiyya Interpretation=Muhammad The Ahmadiyya Community (Ahmadi) while accepting Muhammad as the 'Seal of the Prophets' (Khatamun Nabiyyin) and the last prophet to have brought a complete and comprehensive universal law for humanity (last law-bearing Prophet), believe that prophethood subordinate to Muhammad is still open. Muhammad is believed to have brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet, the apex of man's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come but they must be subordinate to Muhammad and cannot exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad The Ahmadiyya community believes Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who founded the movement in Qadian, India in 1889, to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, who claimed a certain kind of prophethood but never claimed to have brought any new divine laws or change the law of Muhammad, but thought he had been Divinely appointed to revive and universally establish the law/religion of Muhammad.The Question of Finality of Prophethood, The Promised Mehdi and Messiha, by Dr. Aziz Ahmad Chaudhry, Islam International Publications Limited Controversy The Ahmadiyya movement understands the term 'Seal of the Prophets' to indicate the culmination and authentication of prophethood in Muhammad, rather than its absolute cessation.Yohanan Friedmann. Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and its Medieval Background Oxford University Press, 2003 p 119-46 Something that has caused controversy in recent times between Ahmadis and the mainstream who accuse them of denying the finality of prophethood.Andrea Lathan (2008) ‚ÄòThe Relativity of Categorizing in the Context of the A·∏•madiyya‚Äô Die Welt des Islams, 48 (3/4): p.378 \\"It is primarily GhulƒÅm A·∏•mad‚Äôs prophetical claim based on his reinterpretation of the prophetology mentioned above that distinguishes the A·∏•madiyya Muslim JamƒÅ øat from the Muslim ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù. In spite of the differentiation GhulƒÅm A·∏•mad had made between the two kinds of prophets and his acceptance of Mu·∏•ammad as the last law- bearing one, many of his adversaries consider his claim as an offence against the finality of Mu·∏•ammad.\\"G. B√∂wering et al. (2013) The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.25 Muslim scholars vehemently opposed him and in subsequent years a movement was founded to deal with this sensitive issue. This movement is still very active in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries where Ahmadiyya adherents are present.Persecution of the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan: An Analysis Under International Law and International Relations Harvard Human Rights Journal, Vol 16, September 2003 Violent Dhaka Rally against Sect, BBC News Eight die in Pakistan Sect Attack, BBC News Sect offices closed in Pakistan, BBC News Bah√° º√≠ Faith view The Bah√° º√≠ Faith regards Muhammad as a Manifestation of God and as the Seal of the Prophets, but does not believe Revelation or Scripture from God has ended. In particular, Bah√° º√≠s regard the end-times prophecies of Islam (and other faiths) as being both metaphorical and literal, and see the B√°b and Bah√°'u'll√°h as fulfilling these prophetic expectations. The latter of these is the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ religion, which considers Islamic law as secondary or tertiary to its own. Muhammad is seen as ending the Adamic cycle, also known as the Prophetic cycle, which is stated to have begun approximately 6,000 years ago,Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, 13 March 1986. Published in and the B√°b and Bah√°'u'll√°h as starting the Bah√° º√≠ cycle, or Cycle of Fulfilment, which will last at least five hundred thousand years with numerous Manifestations of God appearing throughout this time. Moreover, Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri Bah√°'u'll√°h gave the Title \\"King of the Messengers\\" (sult√°n al-rusul) to the B√°b, and the \\"Sender of the Messengers\\" (mursil al-rusul) to himself. Additionally, the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n shows the Islamic concept of the oneness of the prophets and the Hadith, \\"knowledge is a single point, which the foolish have multipied,\\" to reveal that the term \\"Seal of the Prophets\\", like Alpha and Omega, apply to all the prophets: \\"Whilst established upon the seat of the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù, they occupy the throne of the ‚Äúlast‚Äù.\\" In summary, these interpretive and legal differences have caused the Bah√°'√≠s to be seen as heretics and apostates by some Muslims, which has led to their persecution in different countries.

Written by Tenzing, a first-generation Tibetan born and brought up in exile, Dreaming Lhasa is perhaps, the first Tibetan feature film to explore the state of exile and the issues of identity, culture and politics as they affect the Tibetan refugee community in India. Plot Karma, a young Tibetan woman from New York City comes to Dharamsala, the exile headquarters of the Dalai Lama in India, in search of her roots. She is making a documentary film about former political prisoners who have escaped from Tibet. One of her interviewees is the recently arrived Dhondup. He reveals to her that his dying mother had made him promise to deliver an old charm box to an exile Tibetan named Loga, and appeals to her for help in locating the man. Their enquiries reveal that Loga, a former CIA-trained resistance fighter, has been missing for the past fifteen years and is presumed to be dead. But is he really dead? As they set out to unravel the mysterious circumstances of his disappearance, Karma finds herself unwittingly attracted to Dhondup even as she is sucked into the vortex of his search, which takes them through the world of the exile Tibetan community in India and becomes a journey of self-discovery. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and has screened in over 30 film festivals worldwide, including the 2005 San Sebastian International Film Festival. Its US distributors, First Run Features, opened the film in New York, at the ImaginAsian Theatre, on 13 April 2007. The film had a limited theatrical release in the US, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The DVD was released in the US by First Run Features on 18 September 2007, and worldwide soon afterwards by White Crane Films. Production In the absence of any kind of a film industry among the exile Tibetan community, the film was shot using a cast almost entirely made up of non-professionals. Only Jampa Kalsang, who plays Dhondup, had some prior acting experience. The rest of the cast was chosen through a casting call sent out on Tibet-related websites, and through an auditioning process in Dharamsala, India, where much of the film was shot. Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso, who plays Karma, normally works in a bank in suburban Washington DC, while Tenzin Jigme, the third main character in the film, is a real-life musician and a member of the popular Tibetan refugee rock band, JJI Exile Brothers. The technical crew consisted mainly of Indian professionals, while an enthusiastic bunch of Tibetans provided them with backup and support. Other information Jeremy Thomas, the acclaimed British producer of The Last Emperor and other films directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, was the main Executive Producer of Dreaming Lhasa. Long-time Tibet supporter, Richard Gere, was also one of the film‚Äôs Executive Producers. Andy Spence, the music composer, is a founder-member of the British pop group, New Young Pony Club. The film was the first Super 16 to 35mm blow-up going the Digital Intermediate route in India. The post-production was mostly done at Prasad EFX in Mumbai.

Gameplay In the single-player tournament mode, the player's chosen character fights against his or her opponent, in best two-out-of-three matches with the CPU or against another human player; however, when both are knocked out simultaneously in the first round, one of them will win the second round. The player has a character roster of six fighters to choose from, each with their own weapons and special techniques - and after the player knocks out five different characters, the player must fight two opponents at once instead of one, for three rounds, and finally an \\"evil\\" solid-gold version of their own character, before their character's own ending sequence. The most notable features are the jump button, and multiplayer mode which allows up to four players to play simultaneously; however, the multiplayer mode does not have an ending (much like Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, which was released earlier in 1992 and also ran on Namco's NA-1 hardware), and the closest a player can get to winning it is if they win ninety-nine times because that is when their \\"WIN\\" counter will roll over.

Originally conceived as a venue for working professional actors in the film and television industries to exercise their artistic skills in roles and material far different from what they were called upon to do in front of the camera, Theatre West first came together as an informal workshop led by Curt Conway. Among its early members were Joyce Van Patten, Naomi Caryl, Betty Garrett, Charles Aidman, Philip Abbott, Richard Dreyfuss, Jack Nicholson, Lee Meriwether, Martin Landau, Earl Holliman, Harry Dean Stanton, Sally Field, Beau Bridges, Carroll O'Connor, Harold Gould, and Marvin Kaplan. (More recent members include Chazz Palminteri, Ray Bradbury, Jim Beaver, John Cygan, Sherwood Schwartz, Pat Harrington, Cecily Adams, Bridget Hanley, Anne Haney, Leslie Caveny, and William Blinn.) One of the company's earliest and most successful productions went on to become a Broadway hit and a treasured perennial of the American theatre. Spoon River Anthology, Charles Aidman's dramatization of poetry of Edgar Lee Masters, was developed in the Theatre West workshop, was transferred to television, and since 1963 has been performed in thousands of productions around the world. More recently, Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Play was developed in the Theatre West workshop, produced by the company, moved to Off-Broadway and then became a feature film, A Bronx Tale, directed by and starring Robert De Niro. John Gallogly adapted and directed two poems by Poet Laureate James Dickey, author of 'Deliverance', that starred Bridget Hanley. May Day Sermon was nominated as Best of the Fest by BBC Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival. Bronwen, the Traw, and the Shape- Shifter premiered after Mr. Dickey's death. Both plays were selected by the California Arts Council for inclusion in the Touring Artists Directory and played throughout California as well as in Atlanta, South Carolina and other states. Love of a Pig by Leslie Caveny traveled to Dublin and is produced around the United States. A vital part of the company is Storybook Theatre, an acclaimed program of original musical plays for children. Begun in 1984, by Lloyd J. Schwartz and Barbara Mallory Schwartz, Storybook Theatre has been honored with commendations from the United States Senate and House of Representatives in addition to scores of local theatre and civic awards and commendations. Storybook Theatre presents interactive, non-threatening musicals with a message. The company is a democratic membership company, run by an artistic board of directors elected by the membership. In addition to producing plays, the theatre presents workshops for actors, writers, musical comedy performers, and students of William Shakespeare, and a special two-year free training class for young professionals, the associate membership. Membership is primarily by audition (for actors) and script submission (for writers). Current artistic moderators for the workshops are Arden Teresa Lewis (actors), Doug Haverty and Christine DiGiovanni (writers), Anthony Grupposo (musical comedy), and Nick McDow (Shakespeare). The executive director is Spike Dolomite Ward. The current Artistic Board of Directors is composed of established Los Angeles based actors/writers/directors and includes Garry Kluger, Jill Jones, Arden Teresa Lewis, George Tovar, Michael Van Duzer, Linda Rand and Dina Morrone. Among Theatre West productions are Mornings at Seven with Betty Garrett, Marvin Kaplan, and Malachi Throne, Patrick Hamilton's Gaslight, an original adaptation, Acting - The First Six Lessons starring Beau Bridges and Emily Bridges, James Goldman's The Lion in Winter starring Jim Beaver and Bridget Hanley, Beaver's own play Verdigris, Rod Serling's Requiem for a Heavyweight, Charlie Mount's political thriller The Leather Apron Club, and Garry Michael Kluger's A Thorn In The Family Paw. Scheduled for spring, 2018, is Steve Nevil's comedy The Night Forlorn, or Waitin' on Godsford.

After its closure in 1968, the airport reopened as TSTC Waco Airport. History=World War II The airport opened May 5, 1942 as Waco Army Air Field and was the headquarters of the Army Air Force Central Instructors' School during World War II. It was deactivated after the war in 1945 but was reactivated in 1948 as a pilot training base under the Air Training Command. Air Training Command Waco Field was renamed for Colonel James T. Connally who had been killed in Japan in 1945. The airport was initially called Connally Air Force Base but the name evolved to also include his first name. In 1951, pilot training was discontinued and replaced with academic and flight training for navigators, radar operators, and bombardiers, with particular emphasis for those officers slated for eventual assignment to Strategic Air Command's B-36 Peacemaker and its ever-increasing fleet of B-47 Stratojets. Pilot training returned in 1953 and an advanced jet pilot training organization with T-33 Shooting Stars was established in addition to navigator training in TB-25 Mitchells. In January 1958, the base became a support facility when the USAF located headquarters of Twelfth Air Force (12 AF) in nearby Waco TX. The Headquarters complex was located near 25th Street and Windsor Ave. No remains of the buildings are present today. In 1965, the Air Force began sharing the base with the State of Texas, the latter having established the James Connally Technical Institute (JCTI) of Texas A&M; University. which would eventually become the main campus and headquarters of Texas State Technical Institute (TSTI). Tactical Air Command In 1966, Convair / General Dynamics also established a modification center at the base to modify B-58 Hustler bombers. The 602d Tactical Air Control Wing was established at the base on 1 March 1966. Base Closure In 1968, as part of a nationwide reduction in air force bases and naval air stations to stay within congressional funding limits while continuing to prosecute the war in Vietnam, James Connally AFB was closed. All navigator training consolidated at Mather Air Force Base, California and 12th Air Force relocated to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas. At this point, the facility was conveyed to the State of Texas by the General Services Administration (GSA). The airport and the base facilities was use as a technical school while General Dynamics remained as a tenant performing modification work on various military aircraft. The General Dynamics facility later ceased operation. From January 2001 through January 2009, the former airfield of James Connally AFB was used by Air Force One when US President George W. Bush visited his Prairie Chapel Ranch, also known as the Western White House, in Crawford, Texas. Civilian Operations In 1984, ElectroSpace Systems Inc. (ESI) constructed a new hangar at the airport for aircraft modification that opened in 1985. In 1987, Chrysler bought ESI and the facility was later named Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems or CTAS. Chrysler subsequently sold the operation to Raytheon in 1996 which renamed the facility Raytheon Aircraft Integration Systems. In 2002, Raytheon sold the facility to L-3 Communications and it is currently known as L-3 Communications Platform Integration Division (PID). In 1991, TSTI was renamed Texas State Technical College (TSTC).

In this form, it is the salt of a sulfonic acid. This compound is an extension of the phenanthroline series of coordination compounds. Ruthenium(II) tris(bathophenanthroline disulfonate), referring to the anionic fragment, is used as a protein dye in biochemistry for differentiating and detecting different proteins in laboratory settings. In recent years, 2-D electrophoresis has been widely accepted as a standard procedure to separate complex protein mixtures in proteome studies (Proteomics). Protein visualisation by Ruthenium(II) tris(bathophenthroline disulfonate) has become a firmly established and widely used method in proteomic analysis and a crucial step in gene expression profiling. For protein detection, it is advantageous to use fluorescent labels containing chromophores which have longer excitation wavelength and emission wavelength than the aromatic amino acids. The dyes used for this important step should combine attributes like good signal to background ratio (contrast), broad linear dynamic range, broad application range, photochemical stability and compatibility to protein identification techniques, e.g. mass spectrometry (MS) or Western blotting. Originally, the ruthenium transition metal complex, ruthenium(II) tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline disulfonate) also termed as ruthenium(II) tris(bathophentroline disulfonate) (RuBPS) was synthesized by Bannwarth http://www.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/orgbio/w3bann/index.html as a precursor molecule for a dye that was used as a non-radioactive label for oligo nucleotides. Later, Rabilloud et al. used RuBPS as a fluorescent label for protein detection in polyacrylamide gels. The fact that RuBPS is not only easy to synthesize but also easy to handle, induced further developments in this field. Lamanda et al. improved the RuBPS staining protocol by selectively destaining the polyacrylamide matrix while the protein content remained tinctured. This new technique entailed a variety of advantages like strong signals, ameliorated signal to background ratio, better linearity and advanced baseline resolution.

Joseph William Graham in St Ann.Scouting in Jamaica Scouting spread quickly and in 1912 the first scout troop in St Catherine was established in Spanish Town. Lord Robert Baden-Powell met his wife Olave Soames on his way to Jamaica in 1912. It was there that he proposed marriage to her at the Myrtle Bank Hotel. It was at the home of the first Spanish Town Scoutmaster, Mr Fitz Herbert Messias, that the first group of girls met. On March 11, 1915, his daughter invited over friends to discuss beginning a Girl Scout Troop. Clare Messias wrote a letter, dated March 16, on behalf of the group asking Miss Daisy Jeffrey-Smith to be their troop leader. Miss Daisy agreed and regular meetings began. Miss Marguerite Aitken was her assistant. The group met at \\"Durham House\\", home of the Jeffrey-Smiths. These Girl Scouts were renamed Girl Guides when they received their warrant from Miss Agnes Baden-Powell. This Spanish Town Scout troop was also responsible for the establishment of Cub Scouts in 1916. Brownie Guides began in 1917 and Ranger Guides in 1919. A scission of the Girl Guides Association led to the formation of the Girl Scouts of Jamaica in August 2008. The groups established were Peenie Wallies, Doctorbirds, Juniors and Seniors.Girl Scouts of Jamaica Timeline 1902: Ernest Thompson Seton formed the Woodcraft Indians in Connecticut, USA 1906: Seton met Lord Robert Baden-Powell and introduced him to Woodcraft Scouting 1907, August 1‚Äì9: Baden-Powell had his first experimental Scout Camp 1907: Pathfinders started in the USA 1908: January - February, ‚ÄúScouting for Boys‚Äù first published 1909: May 24, British Boy Scouts (BBS) (British Girl Scouts (BGS) started later) 1910: The Boy Scouts Association started in Britain 1910: Girl Guides started in Britain 1910: Boy Scouts started in Jamaica (SAJ) 1911: November 11, Order of World Scouts (OWS) formed 1915: March 11, Girl Guides started in Jamaica (GGA) 1922: World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) formed 1928: World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) formed 1963: The Scout Association of Jamaica (SAJ) admitted to the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) 1966: The Girl Guides Association of Jamaica (GGA) admitted to the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) 2007: Centenary Celebration of Boy Scouting (SA) 2008: August 5, Girl Scouts started in Jamaica (GSJ) 2008: Girl Scouts of Jamaica (GSJ) admitted to the Order of World Scouts (OWS) 2009: Centenary Celebration of British Boy Scouting and British Girl Scouting (BBS & BGS) 2010: Centenary Celebration of Girl Guiding (GGA, now GGUK) 2011: Centenary Celebration of the Order of World Scouts (OWS) See alsoReferences ","title":"Scouting and Guiding in Jamaica"},{"id":"9645202","text":"Krupabai Satthianadhan (1862-1894) was an Indian author who wrote in English.  Early life  Krupabai was born to Haripunt and Radhabai Khisty, Hindu converts to Christianity, in Ahmednagar, then in the Bombay Presidency. Her father died when she was still a child, and she was brought up by her mother and elder brother, Bhasker. Bhasker, who was much older, had a strong influence on her and endeavoured to awaken her intellect by lending her books and discussing many issues with her. However, he too died young, and Krupabai immortalized him in her semi-autobiographical novel Saguna: A Story of Native Christian Life. She also wrote another novel entitled 'Kamala, A Story of Hindu Life' (1894). Both these novels are Bildungsroman, in which she speaks about gender, caste, ethnicity and cultural identity. Despite the difference in social milieu, two novels deals with a similar theme: the predicament of women who resist being cast in the slandered mould of domesticity. Kamala and Saguna are both attracted to books and face varying degrees hostility such an unnatural inclination. Saguna is largely autobiographical. As the daughter of a Christian convert, the protagonist manages, despite the odds, not only to receive formal education, but also to get admission to a medical college, and eventually meets a man who could share her life as equal. Training in medicine Krupabai was deeply wounded by Bhasker's death, and two European missionary ladies took charge of her and her education. This was her first encounter with the British at close quarters, and as Saguna shows it was a mixed experience. Later on she went to boarding school in the city of Bombay. She met an American woman doctor there who got her interested in medicine. Krupabai had absorbed her father's missionary ideals early in life and decided that by becoming a doctor she could help other women, especially those in purdah. By this time her health was already showing signs of deterioration, so although she won a scholarship to go to England and study medicine, she was not allowed to go. However, the Madras Medical College agreed to admit her in 1878, and she became a boarder at the house of the Reverend W.T. Satthianadhan, an extremely well known Christian missionary. Her academic performance was brilliant from the start, but due to strain and overwork she had her first breakdown in health a year later, and had to return to her sister in Pune to convalesce in 1879. Teaching career A year later she was back at Madras, where she met and developed a friendship with Samuel Satthianadhan, the Reverend's son. In 1881 Samuel and Krupabai married. Soon after Samuel got a job as Headmaster of Breeks Memorial School in Ootacamund. In Ootacamund Krupabai was able to start a school for Muslim girls with help from the Church Missionary Society, and she also taught in a number of other girls schools as well. Ootacamund was a hill station renowned for its salubrious climate and Krupabai's health stayed fair. She was able to find the time and energy to write, and published articles under the byline 'An Indian Lady' in leading periodicals. Three years later the couple moved to Rajamundry, and Krupabai became ill again, so they relocated to Kumbakonam. In spite of the changeableness of her health this was a very productive period for her, and by the time they returned permanently to Madras in 1886 she was ready to begin a full-scale novel. Saguna was serialised between 1887 and 1888 in the prestigious Madras Christian College Magazine. However, during this time her only child died before reaching its first birthday and she was plunged into depression for which she required treatment. Her tuberculosis was diagnosed in Bombay but was certified beyond cure. Knowing that she had little time to live, she began work on Kamala. She worked continuously on the book till her death, breaking off only to write a memoir of her father-in-law and an unfinished one of her mother-in-law. Her death came as a great blow to her admirers and just a few months afterwards a scholarship for women was set up in her memory at the Madras Medical College, and a memorial medal at the University of Madras for the best female Matriculation candidate in English. Her novels were published as books and translated into Tamil.
