Schmidt. First published in 1971, it remains in print and is one of the most popular Dutch books for children, and the second most popular book by Schmidt (after Jip and Janneke). A radio drama based on the book was produced in 2002, and a movie in 2004; Tow Truck Pluck ranked No. 10 on the list of most popular Dutch movies between 1996 and 2005 and was awarded platinum status early in January 2005. The cover of Pluk (all drawings are by Schmidt's regular illustrator, Fiep Westendorp) is used to illustrate the article about Schmidt on the website of the \\"Canon of the Netherlands,\\" and Pluk got his own stamp in 1999. Publication history Schmidt and Westendorp began Pluk as a weekly illustrated feuilleton for Margriet, a ladies' magazine, in 1968 and 1969. They were first printed in book form in 1971, and have remained in print ever since. The 1995 printing was the 18th, and brought the total printed copies to 495,000. Indications of the book's lasting popularity are that 75,000 copies were printed in 1991, twenty years after its first publication; the 1992 printing was the third-bestselling book for children age 6‚Äì10 in the month of June, the best-selling book in that category in August, and the second- bestselling book in that category in June 1995. Eleven unpublished chapters were found in 2001, a kind of prequel to the stories in the book. These were organized with the help of Fiep Westendorp (Schmidt had died already), and were then published as Pluk Redt de Dieren (Pluk Saves the Animals). That book was published in 2004 and sold 150,000 copies, making it the best-selling Dutch children's book of the year. Content The book, like Schmidt's other children's novels, has a \\"realistic, modern setting\\"‚ÄîPluk drives a little truck and has a difficult time finding a place to live‚Äîbut his world is full of fairy-tale creatures, such as, in this case, talking cockroaches, pigeons, and seagulls; horses of record-length; extinct fantastical birds;Arendjan Heerma van Voss, the director of VPRO, the public broadcasting cooperation which produced the radio drama, provides the voice for this bird, the Krullevaar; he confessed that he always wanted the Dutch audience to hear him say, \\"Yes, but I'm an extinct bird!\\" Quoted in and a werewolf who operates a ferry. In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. Pluk, a young red-haired boy, lives alone in a little room on the top floor of the Petteflet, an apartment building. He has no parents, but he does have a little tow truck. He quickly makes friends, such as Zaza, a cockroach, and Mr. Penn, who operates a bookstore. With the help of Dolly, a friendly pigeon, he exchanges notes and candy with the girl below, Aggie, whose mother is √ºberclean and tries to get Pluk evicted, especially when she sees Zaza in his room (her scheme is foiled with the help of a number of seagulls). With the Stamper family (a single father and six unkempt boys) and Aggie, Pluk spends a week at the beach. The book's biggest adventure is the rescue of the park, which is to make room for developments. Pluk has to travel a great distance to get help from a mysterious hermit (who refers to himself as a hermite); the magic berries he brings back have a strange effect: the construction crew and all the other adults (including the mayor) get giddy and forget all about their task‚Äîinstead, they go and play. As a final adventure, Pluk helps save a strange bird, the \\"krullevaar,\\" bred from a mysterious egg he and Aggie found on their vacation at the beach. Educational value and reception Annie M.G. Schmidt is often praised (and with her often Guus Kuijer) for bringing a new direction to Dutch children's literature. Breaking with a fairly conservative and realistic tradition of books about heroes with many conventional inner virtues, Schmidt's characters are often rebellious, and Pluk is often cited as one of those kind-hearted but serious rebels. The scene in the park, when the authority figures are all intoxicated after eating the berries Pluk has brought from the hermit, is one example of such antiestablishmentarianism. Hailed as a \\"modern classic,\\" many educational books advise reading Pluk. Others suggest reading the book since it is said to teach children the value of serving others. The book is referred to in many Dutch books, fiction and non-fiction, in which parents read to their children or adults reflect on their childhood. Translations Pluk was translated to German as Pluck mit dem Kranwagen; it is praised by German critics as a positive reading experience. Pluk has also appeared in Norwegian, in Polish and in Spanish. The Dutch publisher, Querido, published an English version, translated by David Colmer, under the title Tow-Truck Pluck in 2011. The book is so canonical that occasionally it is used in case studies in language research.Piet van Avermaet et al., \\"The Role of the Teacher in Task- Based Language Teaching,\\" in p. 186-87. According to the Annie M.G. Schmidt website, there are also translations of Pluk in Bulgarian, Danish, Estonian, Afrikaans (Wannie van die woonstel), West Frisian, and Serbo-Croatian.

Internally, it was referred to as \\"McD\\" (mick-D). It was sold to hometown bank KeyCorp in 1998, but was eventually sold to the U.S. investment arm of Swiss banking giant UBS AG in 2007. History It was formed in 1924 by Charles Bert \\"Bert\\" McDonald and James Callahan, who borrowed $50,000 to buy the Geo. W. York Co. The pair would rename the firm McDonald & Callahan. The firm would use several more names before settling on McDonald & Co. in 1944. In 1964, McD bought Field, Richards & Co.http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=MCS McD was organized as a partnership until it went public on July 20, 1983. The IPO increased McD's capital from $6 million to $24 million, with 80% of the stock held by the former partners of the partnership. In December 1990, McD acquired S. J. Wolfe & Co., a stock brokerage firm and an over-the-counter trading operation. At the time of KeyCorp merger, McD was the leader in merger transactions in the Midwest during the past two years, according to the American Banker trade newspaper. It also had nearly 700 retail brokers, 160 investment bankers, and about 260 specialists in capital markets. At the same time as the KeyCorp merger, McD was making a couple acquisitions of its own. In September 1998, McD completed the purchase of Rochester, NY-based brokerage firm Essex Capital Markets Inc.http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A;/McDonald_Co_Investments_Inc_acquires_Essex_Capital_Markets_Inc-770854020 Essex had 55 brokers and 4 offices in Buffalo, Syracuse, Lockport, and Jamestown.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_199808/ai_n8815870/?tag=rel.res1 It was also attempting to buy Raleigh, NC-based full-service investment banking firm Trident Securities Inc. Accordingly, Key would buy Trident in a stock deal in April 1999 and it would be operated as a separate division of McD.http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/1999/03/01/story6.html On January 1, 2001, McD bought The Wallach Company, a Denver, C0-based investment banking firm.https://www1.snl.com/Cache/801804.pdf?O=3&IID;=100334&OSID;=9&FID;=801804 However, the firm began to decline in the waning years under KeyCorp. As such, a number of top brokers bolted the firm in the final 3 years before the UBS deal. The attrition of brokers and assets was particularly harsh in 2005. In February, Todd and Donn Carmel, the sons of the former CEO Bill Carmel, also left the firm for Smith Barney (now known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney). In March, Trident would be shuttered, according to the News & Observer (Raleigh, NC). But the biggest blow was in April of that year, when superstars David Knall and Jeff Cohen took their 30-person team and roughly $3.5 billion in assets to rival Stifel Nicolaus.http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID;=113&ArticleID;=18395 However, Mr. Knall was not without his own cloud of controversy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged that he was involved in insider trading.https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20380.pdf Knall would settle with the SEC in December 2007 in exchange for a one-year suspension and agreed to pay $123,865 in fines and restitution.http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/10203/investment- manager-insider-trading.html Nonetheless, as a result of the Knall group's departure in 2005, McD was forced to cut a deal with Stifel to dispose of a costly lease for the northside Indianapolis offices Knall had occupied. In November 2005, the Don and Howard Kaplan team and Scott Litwin in Cincinnati also moved to Stifel.http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/04/21/newscolumn1.html Another blow was the loss of the Bosart Group, which was based in the affluent Detroit suburb of Birmingham, MI, to Wachovia Securities (now known as Wells Fargo Advisors) in December 2005. The patriarch, Eugene H. \\"Trip\\" Bosart III, was not only a big producer, but also served on the board of directors of McD when it was independent firm. The loss of Bosarts was demoralizing. Additionally, more brokers fled between the announcement and consummation of the UBS deal, including 7 sizable Gradison producers in Cincinnati.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2007/02/05/newscolumn6.html Names McDonald & Callahan, McDonald & Company Investment Inc., McDonald Investments, McDonald Financial Group, Gradison McDonald Investments Gradison McDonald was used in the greater Cincinnati area.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2006/09/04/daily17.html The Gradison name, which lasted for 80 years, was acquired in October 1991 for $22.63 million.http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A;/McDonald_Co_Investments_Inc_acquires_Gradison_Co_Inc-210203020 Gradison & Co. was founded in 1925.http://www.secinfo.com/d19sz.98.htm In 2004, KeyCorp management decided to rebrand McD as \\"McDonald Financial Group,\\" creating a functional unit (but a not legal entity) by combining KeyCorp's trust department and private banking with the brokerage operations. Business McD operated a regional investment banking and securities brokerage business. It engaged in such activities as the origination, underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of fixed income and equity securities, and investment advisory and investment services. Since 1991, the principal offices were located at 800 Superior Avenue in downtown Cleveland, known as the McDonald Investment Center. It operated in the northern United States, as well as Canada, United Kingdom and the Far East. The retail brokerage or private clients (individual customers) were primarily located in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and western New York. In 1998, its last year as a stand-alone firm, commission and fees accounted for 40% revenues, investment income was 31%, trading income was 18%, and all other income was 11%.http://www.business.com/directory/financial_services/investment_banking_and_brokerage/brokerage_dealers/mcdonald_and_company_investments,_inc/profile/ Management Willard E. \\"Bill\\" Carmel was a partner at McD since 1968. He was the corporate secretary from June 7, 1983, to July 23, 1984, and was the firm's president from July 23, 1984, to April 1, 1989. He would later become managing partner from 1989 to 1990 as well as CEO from April 1, 1989, to January 1, 1994. Eventually, Carmel would be chairman of the board from April 1, 1989, to August 1, 1995.http://www.secinfo.com/dsVS7.bW3.htm Thomas M. McDonald ran the Private Client Group from June 1, 1997 until roughly 2003. He left to become the president and CEO of Wayne Hummer Investments in Chicago.http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/financial-markets- investing-investment/5744647-1.html At the time of the KeyCorp merger, the chairman of the board of directors was Thomas M. O'Donnell, president and chief executive officer was William B. \\"Bill\\" Summers, Jr., treasurer was Robert T. Clutterbuck, secretary was Thomas F. Mc Kee. Bill Summers became CEO since January 1, 1994. He began with the firm in 1971 as an intern. Shortly after the merger, O'Donnell would retire and Summers would gain the chairman's title along with CEO. Summers would retain both titles for more than a year after the merger, and Clutterbuck would become president in 1998. Affectionately known as \\"Clutter\\" by friends and colleagues, Clutterbuck was an effective, hands-on manager, who also began with the firm as an intern on the muni bond desk within fixed income while he was in college. He joined the firm in June 1974 and in April 1977 was named the second youngest partner in firm history.http://www.newyorklife.com/file/pdf/0,2482,643,00.pdf Later, Summers would pass the CEO mantle to Clutterbuck in 2000 but would remain chairman.https://people.forbes.com/profile/william-b-summers/26129 Although very popular with the rank and file, Clutterbuck's constant battles with the bank to preserve the McD culture made him no friends in Key Tower. Moreover, Clutterbuck refused to forgo his minimum annual bonus for 2001, despite the decision by the rest of Key's senior management to forsake bonuses following a difficult operating year. Thus, Clutterbuck received $1.289 million bonus pursuant to employment agreement signed as part of the merger, according to KeyCorp's 2002 proxy statement. This led to his quick demise. Yet, since Clutterbuck's employment agreement extended until December 31, 2004, and it stipulated that he serve as the chairman and chief executive officer of Key Capital Partners and the chief executive officer of McDonald Investments Inc., Key needed a way to mollify him. In August 2002, Clutterbuck would get the newly created vice chairman moniker and transitioned the CEO title to Robert G. Jones, a lifelong banker. However, buried within the details as a subtle shift in control. Jones would report to KeyCorp Chairman and CEO Henry Meyer instead of Summers, who was still the Chairman of McD.http://www1.snl.com/irweblinkx/ShowFile.aspx?Output=HTML&KeyFile;=1041064&Format;=SGML Yet, Jones surprised and impressed many McD employees in his brief 2 years as CEO. For instance, Jones spent considerable time learning the brokerage business and resisted major changes, particularly those that would rankle retail brokers. In the end, the well-regarded Jones was stuck in underfunded unit and had limited career upside at parent KeyCorp. Jones would eventually leave in September 2004 to become president and CEO of Old National Bank in Evansville, Indiana.http://www1.snl.com/irweblinkx/bio.aspx?IID=100391&PID;=223289&AIP;=2234&PersonSection;=12764 It took roughly 3 months before Key would tap Robert B. \\"Yank\\" Heisler, Jr., a long-time Key banker, to replace Jones as CEO. In fact, Heisler would retain the title of chairman of KeyBank N.A.http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2004-12/4198503-robert-b-yank- heisler-jr-named-ceo-of-keycorp-s-mcdonald-financial-group-008.htm Both the delay in naming a replacement and the fact Heisler keeping his primary office down the street at Key Tower were harbingers of what would become of McD. He would be the last CEO of McD. Near that time, Salvatore A. \\"Sam\\" Messina, one of the principals of Essex, became the head of the Private Client Group. Summers would remain as chairman until 2006.

For the 72 years between its opening in 1943 and its closure, the mine supplied sub-bituminous coal to fire Port Augusta's power stations. Production ceased in November 2015 but stockpiled product was transported to Port Augusta until the last power station closed down in May 2016.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-19/leigh-creek-traditional-owners- want-mine-site-revegetated/6954228 Coal mine The open cut mine operation extracted low-grade, sub-bituminous coal\\"The South Australian Coal Industry\\" submission by Department of Primary Industries and Resources, South Australia, Industry Commission Inquiry into the Australian Black Coal Industry, December 1997; accessed at Productivity Commission website 13 Jan 2014 that was transported 250 km by rail to power stations outside Port Augusta on the east side of Spencer Gulf. The coal occurs in several nested bowl-shaped seams, each several metres thick. The coalfield at Leigh Creek was operated at first by the Electricity Trust of South Australia then by Alinta Energy, and produced over 2.5 million tonnes a year of coal. Alinta energy also operated the power stations at Port Augusta; they were the last coal-fired electricity generators in South Australia, and the only users of coal from Leigh Creek. = Exploration = In 1888, John Henry Reid discovered coal-bearing shale during the sinking of a railway dam in the Leigh Creek area (Henry Brown, Government Geologist confirmed the find in his visit to Leigh's Creek in February 1889). This discovery led to a geological examination of the area by a government geologist and the establishment of underground workings. No 1 shaft, sunk by the Leigh Creek Coal Mining Company, was abandoned on striking a heavy flow of water. A new shaft was sunk in 1892 but only small quantities of coal were extracted for experimental purposes and operations ceased in 1894. = Development = It was not until 1940 when coal supplies became critically low because of the Second World War that Leigh Creek coal was considered again. The deposits seemed extensive and extracting the coal by open cut methods was considered feasible. Exploratory boring started in 1941 and plans were made to develop the first open cut mine. Excavation started in 1943 under the control of the Engineering & Water Supply Department. It was apparent that the electricity supply industry would be the largest user of Leigh Creek coal so control of the coalfield was transferred to the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) in 1948. ETSA ordered boilers capable of burning Leigh Creek coal for the Osborne Power Station near Port Adelaide and, after thorough investigations, decided to establish a power station at Port Augusta to burn Leigh Creek coal exclusively. Playford A Power Station was built in the 1950s, followed by Playford B Power Station in the 1960s. The combined A and B plants, with a total generating capacity of 330 megawatts, were named in recognition of the then South Australian Premier, Sir Thomas Playford. The use of large excavating machines and efficient mining equipment at Leigh Creek, together with the rebuilding of a railway line between Leigh Creek and Port Augusta by the Commonwealth Railways, resulted in economic production and delivery of coal to the power station. Pacific National provided the coal freight service from 2001. = Expansion = In the mid 1970s it was decided to build a 500 megawatt station at Port Augusta, called the Northern Power Station. That decision meant enlarging the coalfield using new methods to extract deeper coal, increasing production, building a retention dam to prevent possible flooding of the field and diverting the main highway around the coalfield. The Northern Power Station, alongside Playford A and B, was commissioned in 1985. Because the existing town was located within the coal basin, a new town was built south of the coalfield and the new Leigh Creek became occupied in 1980. Since the early 1990s, more changes occurred in Leigh Creek. Massive restructuring of mining operations resulted in the reduction of a workforce of over 750 to about 200. The township also became a lot smaller. The population dropped from about 2500 in 1987 to less than 700 today. The loss of residents also resulted in the loss of many services. Whilst most workers at the coalfields make a good income, the high cost of communication and services drastically reduce the disposable income. Schooling at Leigh Creek has become a bigger problem than ever before. Reasonable education is available for younger students in the primary school. For high school students, the meagre subject choice has made education at the Leigh Creek Area School not the ideal option for many students. Many parents have to send their children away at 13 years old, to get a good education in Adelaide or regional cities like Port Augusta. A simple medical procedure may require a trip to Adelaide, which means a round trip of about 1200 km. Rail transportation Coal was originally transported by a gauge railway that went in and out of the Flinders Ranges via Hawker (315m amsl) and Quorn (293m amsl). However, railway was not designed to handle frequent heavy loads. Instead of upgrading the line it was decided to build a heavier, standard- gauge line via the plains to the west of the ranges, which would not incur significantly higher construction costs. The new Marree line opened in 1957; the extension beyond the mine was justified by cattle traffic from that town. Although the line was built to handle coal traffic, Marree provided an advantage of moving further north the point at which passengers had to transfer between a modern, air-conditioned train and the ancient narrow-gauge train, The Ghan, when journeying to and from Alice Springs. The change-of- gauge role was lost 23 years later, when a standard gauge line to Alice Springs ‚Äì routed well to the west of the Central Australia Railway ‚Äì was opened in 1980, rendering the narrow gauge line to Alice Springs redundant. In 1987, the terminus of the standard-gauge Marree line was pulled back to Telford Cut, where a balloon loop was built to simplify train operations.Brachina - Telford SA Track & Signal The railway ceased operation after the power station closed in May 2016. Closure On 11 June 2015, Alinta Energy announced their intent to cease operating the Leigh Creek coal mine beyond March 2018, closing it along with the related Playford B and Northern power stations, and warned that closure would be sooner should business conditions worsen further. On 30 July 2015, Alinta Energy announced that the closure dates of all three facilities were to be brought forward by 12 months; the company intended not operate the generating plant past March 2017 and could shut it down as early as March 2016. The closure date for the Port Augusta power stations was later delayed until 8 May 2016. On 7 October 2015, it was confirmed that mining operations would cease on 17 November 2015. After that date, stockpiled coal was railed to Port Augusta until the power station closed in May 2016. Remediation Following closure of the mine, Alinta was required to remediate the site that had been mined for over 70 years. An initial priority was to ensure that any remaining coal could not spontaneously ignite. This was achieved the battering the steep mine sides down to shallower angles, and covering any potential coal deposits with at least two metres of inert earth. Township The nearby town of Leigh Creek supported the mine during its operation.

He served as Bishop of Concordia, Kansas (1887‚Äì1891) and Bishop of Omaha, Nebraska (1891‚Äì1916). Life Richard Scannell was born in Cloyne, County Cork, to Patrick and Johanna (n√©e Collins) Scannell. After completing his classical studies in a private school at Midleton, he entered All Hallows College in Dublin in 1866 and was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, on February 26, 1871. He arrived in the United States later that year and then served as a curate at Holy Rosary Cathedral until 1878, when he became pastor of St. Columba's Church in East Nashville. He returned to the cathedral as rector in 1879 and, following the transfer of Bishop Patrick Feehan to the Archdiocese of Chicago, served as apostolic administrator from 1880 to 1883. After a leave of absence for health reasons, he organized St. Joseph's Parish in West Nashville and built its church in 1885. In August 1886, he was appointed vicar general of the Diocese. On August 9, 1887, Scannell was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Concordia, Kansas, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 30 from Archbishop Feehan, with Bishops William McCloskey and Joseph Rademacher serving as co- consecrators, at St. Joseph's Church. With only 20 resident pastors and a growing Catholic population, Scannell attempted to solve the priest shortage by establishing a preparatory seminary in Belleville, laying its cornerstone in June 1890. However, due to an economic depression, the seminary was never built and left a long-lasting debt. During his three-year-long tenure, he also assisted the Sisters of St. Joseph to become permanently established in the Diocese, erected fifteen churches, and increased the number of diocesan priests from five to twenty-two. Scannell was named to succeed the late James O'Connor as Bishop of Omaha, Nebraska, on January 30, 1891. Under his governance, the cornerstone of St. Cecilia Cathedral was laid in 1907, and the Diocese of Kearney was formed out of the western part of the Diocese in 1912. He also oversaw the Diocese's expansion to 95 parishes, serving more than 80,000 Catholics. Parochial schools and diocesan priests more than doubled in number, and increases were also made among religious. He erected the Creighton Memorial St. Joseph's Hospital and St. Catherine's Hospital, and a home of the Good Shepherd. He also introduced the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, Sisters of St. Joseph, Presentation Sisters, Sisters of the Resurrection, Sisters of St. Benedict, Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, Good Shepherd Sisters, the Dominicans, Felicians, Ursulines, and Franciscans.

These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a phase shift or regime shift), when perturbed. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. Alternative stable state theory suggests that discrete states are separated by ecological thresholds, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an environmental gradient.  Theory  Alternative stable state theory was first proposed by Richard Lewontin (1969), but other early key authors include Holling (1973), Sutherland (1974), May (1977), and Scheffer et al. (2001). In the broadest sense, alternative stable state theory proposes that a change in ecosystem conditions can result in an abrupt shift in the state of the ecosystem, such as a change in population (Barange, M. et al. 2008) or community composition. Ecosystems can persist in states that are considered stable (i.e., can exist for relatively long periods of time). Intermediate states are considered unstable and are, therefore, transitory. Because ecosystems are resistant to state shifts, significant perturbations are usually required to overcome ecological thresholds and cause shifts from one stable state to another. The resistance to state shifts is known as \\"resilience\\" (Holling 1973). State shifts are often illustrated heuristically by the ball-in-cup model (Holling, C.S. et al., 1995) Biodiversity in the functioning of ecosystems: an ecological synthesis. In Biodiversity Loss, Ecological and Economical Issues (Perrings, C.A. et al., eds), pp. 44‚Äì83, Cambridge University Press). A ball, representing the ecosystem, exists on a surface where any point along the surface represents a possible state. In the simplest model, the landscape consists of two valleys separated by a hill. When the ball is in a valley, or a \\"domain of attraction\\", it exists in a stable state and must be perturbed to move from this state. In the absence of perturbations, the ball will always roll downhill and therefore will tend to stay in the valley (or stable state). State shifts can be viewed from two different viewpoints, the \\"community perspective\\" and the \\"ecosystem perspective\\". The ball can only move between stable states in two ways: (1) moving the ball or (2) altering the landscape. The community perspective is analogous to moving the ball, while the ecosystem perspective is analogous to altering the landscape. These two viewpoints consider the same phenomenon with different mechanisms. The community perspective considers ecosystem variables (which change relatively quickly and are subject to feedbacks from the system), whereas the ecosystem perspective considers ecosystem parameters (which change relatively slowly and operate independently of the system). The community context considers a relatively constant environment in which multiple stable states are accessible to populations or communities. This definition is an extension of stability analysis of populations (e.g., Lewontin 1969; Sutherland 1973) and communities (e.g., Drake 1991; Law and Morton 1993). The ecosystem context focuses on the effect of exogenic \\"drivers\\" on communities or ecosystems (e.g., May 1977; Scheffer et al. 2001; Dent et al. 2002). Both definitions are explored within this article.  Ecological community  Ecosystems can shift from one state to another via a significant perturbation directly to state variables. State variables are quantities that change quickly (in ecologically-relevant time scales) in response to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are dependent on system feedbacks), such as population densities. This perspective requires that different states can exist simultaneously under equal environmental conditions, since the ball moves only in response to a state variable change. For example, consider a very simple system with three microbial species. It may be possible for the system to exist under different community structure regimes depending on initial conditions (e.g., population densities or spatial arrangement of individuals) (Kerr et al. 2002). Perhaps under certain initial densities or spatial configurations, one species dominates over all others, while under different initial conditions all species can mutually coexist. Because the different species interact, changes in populations affect one another synergistically to determine community structure. Under both states the environmental conditions are identical. Because the states have resilience, following small perturbations (e.g., changes to population size) the community returns to the same configuration while large perturbations may induce a shift to another configuration. The community perspective requires the existence of alternative stable states (i.e., more than one valley) before the perturbation, since the landscape is not changing. Because communities have some level of resistance to change, they will stay in their domain of attraction (or stable state) until the perturbation is large enough to force the system into another state. In the ball-and-cup model, this would be the energy required to push the ball up and over a hill, where it would fall downhill into a different valley.  Ecosystem  It is also possible to cause state shifts in another context, by indirectly affecting state variables. This is known as the ecosystem perspective. This perspective requires a change in environmental parameters that affect the behavior of state variables. For example, birth rate, death rate, migration, and density-dependent predation indirectly alter the ecosystem state by changing population density (a state variable). Ecosystem parameters are quantities that are unresponsive (or respond very slowly) to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are independent of system feedbacks). The stable state landscape is changed by environmental drivers, which may result in a change in the quantity of stable states and the relationship between states. By the ecosystem perspective, the landscape of the ecological states is changed, which forces a change in the ecosystem state. Changing the landscape can modify the number, location, and resilience of stable states, as well as the unstable intermediate states. By this view, the topography in the ball-and-cup model is not static, as it is in the community perspective. This is a fundamental difference between the two perspectives. Although the mechanisms of community and ecosystem perspectives are different, the empirical evidence required for documentation of alternative stable states is the same. In addition, state shifts are often a combination of internal processes and external forces (Scheffer et al. 2001). For example, consider a stream-fed lake in which the pristine state is dominated by benthic vegetation. When upstream construction releases soils into the stream, the system becomes turbid. As a result, benthic vegetation cannot receive light and decline, increasing nutrient availability and allowing phytoplankton to dominate. In this state shift scenario the state variables changing are the populations of benthic vegetation and phytoplankton, and the ecosystem parameters are turbidity and nutrient levels. So, whether identifying mechanisms of variables or parameters is a matter of formulation (Beisner et al. 2003).  Hysteresis effects  Hysteresis is an important concept in alternative stable state theory. In this ecological context, hysteresis refers to the existence of different stable states under the same variables or parameters. Hysteresis can be explained by \\"path- dependency\\", in which the equilibrium point for the trajectory of \\"A ‚Üí B\\" is different from for \\"B ‚Üí A\\". In other words, it matters which way the ball is moving across the landscape. Some ecologists (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001) argue that hysteresis is a prerequisite for the existence of alternative stable states. Others (e.g., Beisner et al. 2003) claim that this is not so; although shifts often involve hysteresis, a system can show alternative stable states yet have equal paths for \\"A ‚Üí B\\" and \\"B ‚Üí A\\". Hysteresis can occur via changes to variables or parameters. When variables are changed the ball is pushed from one domain of attraction to another, yet the same push from the other direction cannot return the ball to the original domain of attraction. When parameters are changed a modification to the landscape results in a state shift, but reversing the modification does not result in a reciprocal shift. A real-world example of hysteresis is helpful to illustrate the concept. Coral reef systems can dramatically shift from pristine coral-dominated systems to degraded algae-dominated systems when populations grazing on algae decline. The 1983 crash of sea urchin populations in Caribbean reef systems released algae from top-down (herbivory) control, allowing them to overgrow corals and resulting in a shift to a degraded state. When urchins rebounded, the high (pre-crash) coral cover levels did not return, indicating hysteresis (Mumby et al. 2007). In some cases, state shifts under hysteresis may be irreversible. For example, tropical cloud forests require high moisture levels, provided by clouds that are intercepted by the canopy (via condensation). When deforested, moisture delivery ceases. Therefore, reforestation is often unsuccessful because conditions are too dry to allow the trees to grow . Even in cases where there is no obvious barrier to recovery, alternative states can be remarkably persistent: an experimental grassland heavily fertilized for 10 years lost much of its biodiversity, and was still in this state 20 years later .  Resilience  By their very nature, basins of attraction display resilience. Ecosystems are resistant to state shifts ‚Äì they will only undergo shifts under substantial perturbations ‚Äì but some states are more resilient than others. In the ball-and-cup model, a valley with steep sides has greater resilience than a shallow valley, since it would take more force to push the ball up the hill and out of the valley. Resilience can change in stable states when environmental parameters are shifted. Often, humans influence stable states by reducing the resilience of basins of attraction. There are at least three ways in which anthropogenic forces reduce resilience (Folke et al. 2004): (1) Decreasing diversity and functional groups, often by top-down effects (e.g., overfishing); (2) altering the physico-chemical environment (e.g., climate change, pollution, fertilization); or (3) modifying disturbance regimes to which organisms are adapted (e.g., bottom trawling, coral mining, etc.). When the resilience is decreased, ecosystems can be pushed into alternative, and often less-desirable, stable states with only minor perturbations. When hysteresis effects are present, the return to a more- desirable state is sometimes impossible or impractical (given management constraints). Shifts to less-desirable states often entail a loss of ecosystem service and function, and have been documented in an array of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments (reviewed in Folke et al. 2004).  Evidence  Most work on alternative stable states has been theoretical, using mathematical models and simulations to test ecological hypotheses. Other work has been conducted using empirical evidence from surveying, historical records, or comparisons across spatial scales. There has been a lack of direct, manipulative experimental tests for alternative stable states. This is especially true for studies outside of controlled laboratory conditions, where state shifts have been documented for cultures of microorganisms. Verifying the existence of alternative stable states carries profound implications for ecosystem management. If stable states exist, gradual changes in environmental factors may have little effect on a system until a threshold is reached, at which point a catastrophic state shift may occur. Understanding the nature of these thresholds will help inform the design of monitoring programs, ecosystem restoration, and other management decisions. Managers are particularly interested in the potential of hysteresis, since it may be difficult to recover from a state shift (Beisner et al. 2003). The mechanisms of feedback loops that maintain stable states are important to understand if we hope to effectively manage an ecosystem with alternative stable states. = Empirical evidence = Empirical evidence for the existence of alternative stable states is vital to advancing the idea beyond theory. Schr√∂der et al. (2005) reviewed the current ecological literature for alternative stable states and found 35 direct experiments, of which only 21 were deemed valid. Of these, 62% (14) showed evidence for and 38% (8) showed no evidence for alternative stable states. However, the Schr√∂der et al. (2005) analysis required evidence of hysteresis, which is not necessarily a prerequisite for alternative stable states. Other authors (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2004) have had less-stringent requirements for the documentation of alternative stable states. State shifts via the community perspective have been induced experimentally by the addition or removal of predators, such as in Paine's (1966) work on keystone predators (i.e., predators with disproportionate influence on community structure) in the intertidal zone (although this claim is refuted by Schr√∂der et al. 2005). Also, Beisner et al. (2003) suggest that commercially exploited fish populations can be forced between alternative stable states by fishing pressure due to Allee effect that work at very low population sizes. Once a fish population falls below a certain threshold, it will inevitably go extinct when low population densities make replacement of adults impossible due to, for example, the inability to find mates or density- dependent mortality. Since populations cannot return from extinction, this is an example of an irreversible state shift. Although alternative stable state theory is still in its infancy, empirical evidence has been collected from a variety of biomes: * The Sahara region, once vegetated, suddenly collapsed into a desert about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago due to climate change (Scheffer and Carpenter 2003). Recent alteration of disturbance states via fire suppression has caused state shifts in fire-adapted ecosystems of the southeastern United States . * In the northeastern United States alternative stable states have been experimentally documented in hardwood forest food webs (Schmitz 2004). Spiders exhibit top-down control on generalist herbivore grasshoppers, causing them to hide in and forage on a competitively dominant plant species. Herbivory on the superior plant competitor reduces dominance, thereby increasing plant diversity. Under experimental removal of spiders, grasshoppers were released from predation and consumed plants without preference for the competitively-superior species. This top competitor outcompeted other species, resulting in lower overall plant diversity. Furthermore, reintroductions of spiders failed to return the system to high plant diversity, indicating ecological thresholds. * Ponds, lakes, and other small bodies of water are ideal for studying alternative stable states because they are relatively self-contained (Holling 1973). There has been great interest in state shifts in shallow temperate lakes between clear-water and turbid-water states. Nutrient loading can shift clear lakes to turbid systems by causing phytoplankton blooms (Scheffer 1997). Feedbacks maintaining the turbid state include shading out benthic macrophytes, which otherwise stabilize sediments and reduce rapid nutrient cycling. Hysteresis may occur if reductions in nutrient input do not return the clear-water state. * Alternative stable states have also been shown for freshwater faunal communities. Initial conditions, such as densities of snails, can influence the movement of an ecosystem into one of several alternative stable equilibria (Chase 2003). * Additionally, alternative stable states have been documented experimentally in coastal marine ecosystems. Arctic salt marshes of Hudson Bay, Manitoba have been shown to shift from a vegetated state to an unvegetated state due to overgrazing by snow geese . When geese were experimentally removed, recovery of the system only occurred under ideal soil conditions, indicating hysteresis.

When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:32-33 Pliny the Elder, writing in the 1st century AD describes Politorium as one of a number of former Latin peoples that have disappeared without trace.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 3:9 The site of ancient Politorium has been identifiedSee William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Vol 2, 1857, pp644-5 as being the town of La Giostra on the Via Appia,Sir William Gell, The Topography of Rome and its Vicinity, 1846 (new edition), 280-283 La Torretta near Decimo on the Via LarrentinaAntonio Nibby Analisi storico-topografico-antiquaria della carta de' Dintorni di Roma, 1830, vol 2 p571, vol3 pp146-52 or Castel di Decima.Fausto Zevi (see Bonnefoy, Y., and Doniger, W., Roman and European Mythologies, 1992, p55) Notes Roman Kingdom Latin cities Destroyed cities ","title":"Politorium"},{"id":"23737691","text":"Central Linn High School is a public high school in Halsey, Oregon, United States. Academics In 2008, 75% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 56 students, 42 graduated, eight dropped out, three received a modified diploma, and three were still in high school the following year. As of the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, the whole school is on self-paced math, through a \\"math lab\\" setting. Students move at their own pace, and don't move on until they know the material. This makes sure learners aren't just being pushed through the system. A similar setup can be seen in the high school levels with the humanities. Central Linn is on a four-day week, but on Fridays, students have the option to come in, work on unfinished work, and get direct feedback. \\"Friday School\\" lasts half a day, and nearly half the school attends. Many prefer this setup over a five-day week. Students are graded on a 4-point system, where 3 is a passing score (the equivalent of a \\"C\\"), and a 4 is exceeding (\\"A\\"). Learners can correct mistakes, and mistakes are not held against them on the final grade. Sports In the 2009‚Äì2010 season the boys' basketball team made it to the state tournament and took second place to Portland Christian. In the following season they returned to the same tournament and took second once again, this time to Western Mennonite, whom they had previously beaten twice in league play. In the 2010‚Äì2011 season Zachary Holloway set a record of points scored by a single player in the tournament, with 36 points. The high school boys' track team has won twelve 1A/2A state championships (1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1978, 1983, 1987, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015).

Above Gomelo is written GOMELL EPS, an abbreviation of Gomellus episcopus (bishop Gomelo). Gomelo II (died 906x9) was the Bishop of Oviedo during the final years of the reign of Alfonso III of Asturias. He succeeded Hermenegild I probably about 892. Only one document from his episcopate survives, though it was interfered with at a later date by Pelagius of Oviedo. Dated 20 January 905, it is charter of the Cathedral of San Salvador signed by a bishop Gomellus along with the bishops Froil√°n of Le√≥n, Sisenand of Iria, Nausto of Coimbra, and Reccared of Lugo. The charter ordered the construction of a castle beside the church in order to house relics‚Äîand refugees‚Äîduring Viking attacks. The cathedral also received as gifts books, ornaments, villages, monasteries, churches, and rents of all kinds, but the jurisdiction over the church of Santa Mar√≠a de Lugo and the towns of Avil√©s and Gij√≥n also given appear to be later (forged) additions. A 1612 copy of this diploma was mis-dated 1 February 925, but the list of bishops confirms the date of the copy in the cartulary of Oviedo. According to a later falsified document of bishop Pelagius of Oviedo, Alfonso III held a council at Oviedo in 899 or 900 and with the approval of a certain \\"Pope John\\" (perhaps John VIII was intended) raised Oviedo to metropolitan rank. A document dated 20 January 905 in Pelagius's Liber testamentorum records a large donation made by the monarch to the see of Oviedo and confirmed by Gomelo II. This document is strongly suspect.

Early life Stepniak was the son of an army doctor and of a noblewoman, born July 1 (O.S.; July 13 N.S.), 1851 in Novy Starodub, Ukraine (then part of the Alexandrovsky Uyezd, Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire). He received a liberal education, and when he left school, he went on to attend Military academy and the artillery school before joining the Russian army. He reached the rank of second lieutenant before resigning his commission in 1871. Revolutionary life His sympathy lay with the peasants, among whom he had lived during his boyhood in the country, which developed in him at first democratic and, later, revolutionary opinions. Together with a few other men of birth and education, he began secretly to sow the sentiments of democracy among the peasants, as a member of the Circle of Tchaikovsky. His teaching did not long remain a secret, and in 1874 he was arrested. He succeeded in making his escape, possibly being permitted to escape on account of his youth, and immediately began a more vigorous campaign against autocracy. His sympathetic nature was influenced by indignation against the brutal methods adopted towards prisoners, especially political prisoners, and by the stern measures which the government of tsar Alexander II felt compelled to adopt in order to repress the revolutionary movement. S. Stepniak In 1874 Stepniak went to the Balkans and joined the rising against the Turks in Bosnia in 1876, and used that experience to write a manual on guerrilla warfare. He also joined the anarchist Errico Malatesta in his small rebellion in the Italian province of Benevento in 1877. He returned to Russia in 1878, joining Zemlya i volya (Land and Liberty), where he along with Nikolai Morozov and Olga Liubatovich edited the party journal. For a time he was convinced that individual acts of political terrorism would convince tsar Alexander II to introduce democratic reforms. On August 4, 1878 O.S. he assassinated General Nikolai Mezentsov, the chief of the Gendarme corps and head of the country's secret police, with a dagger in the streets of St Petersburg. After the killing, he exposed himself to danger by remaining in Russia, and in 1880 he was obliged to leave the country. He settled for a short time in Switzerland, then a favourite resort of revolutionary leaders, and after a few years came to London. He was already known in England by his book, Underground Russia, which had been published in London in 1882. In England he established the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom and the Russia Free Press, linking with Karl Pearson, Wilfrid Voynich and Charlotte Wilson. He was also an editor for the Society's house organ, Free Russia. He followed up Underground Russia with a number of other works on the condition of the Russian peasantry, on Nihilism, and on the conditions of life in Russia. His mind gradually turned from belief in the efficacy of violent measures to the acceptance of constitutional methods. In his last book, King Stork and King Log, Stepniak spoke with approval of the efforts of politicians on the Liberal side to effect, by argument and peaceful agitation, a change in the attitude of the Russian government towards various reforms. Stepniak constantly wrote and lectured, both in Great Britain and the United States, in support of his views, and his energy, added to the interest of his personality, won him many friends. He was chiefly identified with the Socialists in England and the Social Democratic parties on the Continent; but he was regarded by people of all opinions as an agitator whose motives had always been pure and disinterested. Stepniak was killed by a train at a railway crossing at Woodstock Road, Chiswick, London, where he resided, on 23 December 1895 (see Stepniak's death on the railway). He was cremated at Woking on 28 December.

Theodoric is famous for his part in defeating Attila (the Hun) at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451, where he was killed on June 20.Jordanes, De Origine Actibusque Getarum, 40.209. Early career In 418 he succeeded King Wallia. The Romans had ordered King Wallia to move his people from Iberia to Gaul. As king, Theodoric completed the settlements of the Visigoths in Gallia Aquitania II, Novempopulana and Gallia Narbonensis, and then used the declining power of the Roman Empire to extend his territory to the south. After the death of Emperor Honorius and the usurpation of Joannes in 423 internal power struggles broke out in the Roman Empire. Theodoric used this situation and tried to capture the important road junction Arelate, but the Magister militum A√´tius, who was assisted by the Huns, was able to save the city.Prosper, Epitoma chronicon 1290, in: MGH Auctores antiquissimi (AA) 9, p. 471; Chronica Gallica of 452, 102, in: MGH AA 9, p. 658; Sidonius Apollinaris, letters 7. 12. 3 The Visigoths concluded a treaty and were given Gallic noblemen as hostages. The later Emperor Avitus visited Theodoric, lived at his court and taught his sons.Sidonius Apollinaris, carmen 7. 215sqq.; 7. 495sqq. Expansion to the Mediterranean Because the Romans had to fight against the Franks, who plundered Cologne and Trier in 435, and because of other events Theodoric saw the chance to conquer Narbo Martius (in 436) to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea and the roads to the Pyrenees. But Litorius, with the aid of the Huns, prevented the capture of the city and drove the Visigoths back to their capital Tolosa.Prosper, Epitoma chronicon 1324 and 1326, in: MGH AA 9, p. 475; Hydatius, chronicle 107 und 110, in: MGH AA 11, p. 22-23; Merobaudes, panegyric, fragment II A 23, in: Vollmer, MGH AA 14, p. 9; Sidonius Apollinaris, carmen 7. 246sqq.; 7. 475sqq. Theodoric's offer of peace was refused, but the king won the decisive battle at Tolosa, and Litorius soon died in Gothic imprisonment from the injuries which he had received in this battle.Prosper, Epitoma chronicon 1335, in: MGH AA 9, p. 476; Hydatius, chronicle 116, in: MGH AA 11, p. 23; Salvian, de gubernatione dei 7. 9. 39sqq. Avitus went ‚Äì according to the orders of A√´tius ‚Äì to Tolosa and offered a peace treaty which Theodoric accepted.Prosper, Epitoma chronicon 1338, in: MGH AA 9, p. 477; Hydatius, chronicle 117, in: MGH AA 11, p. 23; Sidonius Apollinaris, carmen 7. 295sqq. Perhaps the Romans recognized at that time the sovereignty of the Visigoth state. Conflict with Vandals A daughter of Theodoric had been married to Huneric, a son of the Vandal ruler Genseric (in 429?), but Huneric later had ambitions to wed Eudocia, a daughter of the Emperor Valentinian III. He therefore accused the daughter of Theodoric of planning to kill him, and in 444 had her mutilated - her ears and nose cut off\\"The Fall of the West\\" by Adrian Goldsworthy, W&N; (2009), (page 330)  and sent back to her father,Jordanes, Getica 36, 184 which earned the enmity of the Vandals. In 444, an enemy of A√´tius, the former magister militum Sebastianus, came to Tolosa.Hydatius, chronicle 129, in: MGH AA 11, p. 24 (dated into the year 444); Prosper, Epitoma chronicon 1342, in: MGH AA 9, p. 478 (wrongly dated into the year 440) This could have strained relations with A√´tius, but Theodoric soon sent his unwelcome guest away, after which the latter captured Barcelona and then was executed on Geiseric's orders in 450. Theodoric was also an enemy of the Suevic king Rechila in Iberia, because Visigoth troops assisted the imperial commander Vitus in his campaign against the Suevi in 446.Hydatius, chronicle 134, in: MGH AA 11, p. 24 But the ability of this people to conduct a strong defence and the better relations between Geiseric and the Roman Empire led Theodoric to change his foreign policy. He therefore, in February 449, married one of his daughters to the new Suevic king Rechiar, who visited his father-in-law at Tolosa in July 449.Hydatius, chronicle 140 and 142, in: MGH AA 11, p. 25; Jordanes, Getica 44. 229 and 231 On his return ‚Äì according to the author Isidore of Seville - Rechiar, with the assistance of Visigoth troops,Isidore, Historia Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum 87, in: MGH AA 11, p. 301 devastated the area surrounding the city of Caesaraugusta and managed by guile to take Ilerda.

Theodoric joined this coalition because he recognized the danger of the Huns to his own realm. With his whole army and his sons, Thorismund and Theodoric, he joined A√´tius. The Visigoth and Roman troops then saved the civitas Aurelianorum and forced Attila to withdraw (June 451).Sidonius Apollinaris, carmen 7, 346sqq.; letters 7. 12. 3; 8. 15. 1; Jordanes, Getica 37. 195; Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum 2. 7; Vita S.

Most Visigoths fought at the right wing under the command of Theodoric but a smaller force fought at the left under the command of Thorismund.Jordanes, Getica 38. 197 and 201 Theodoric's forces contributed decisively to the victory of the Romans, but he himself was killed during the battle. Jordanes records two different accounts of his death: one was that Theodoric was thrown from his horse and trampled to death; the second was that Theodoric was slain by the spear of the Ostrogoth Andag, who was the father of Jordanes's patron Gunthigis. The body of Theodoric wasn't found until the next day. According to Gothic tradition he was mourned and buried by his warriors on the battlefield.Jordanes, Getica 40. 209 and 41. 214; Hydatius, chronicle 150, in: MGH AA 11, p. 26 Immediately Thorismund was elected as successor of his father. Other sons of Theodoric were Theodoric II, Frederic, Euric I, Retimer and Himnerith.Jordanes, Getica 36. 190 Legacy For his sacrifice and subsequent victory over Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, Theodoric became a revered figure in Western historiography, and served as an inspiration for J.

Klenau, the son of a Bohemian noble, joined the Habsburg military as a teenager and fought in the War of Bavarian Succession against Prussia, Austria's wars with the Ottoman Empire, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars, in which he commanded a corps in several important battles. In the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Klenau distinguished himself at the Wissembourg lines, and led a battle-winning charge at Handschuhsheim in 1795. As commander of the Coalition's left flank in the Adige campaign in northern Italy in 1799, he was instrumental in isolating the French-held fortresses on the Po River by organizing and supporting a peasant uprising in the countryside. Afterward, Klenau became the youngest lieutenant field marshalThe youngest lieutenant field marshal not of the House of Habsburg. At age 20, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, was the youngest. in the history of the Habsburg military. As a corps commander, Klenau led key elements of the Austrian army in its victory at Aspern-Esslingen and its defeat at Wagram, where his troops covered the retreat of the main Austrian force. He commanded the IV Corps at the 1813 Battle of Dresden and again at the Battle of Nations at Leipzig, where he prevented the French from outflanking the main Austrian force on the first day of the engagement. After the Battle of Nations, Klenau organized and implemented the successful Dresden blockade and negotiated the French capitulation there. In the 1814‚Äì15 campaign, he commanded the Corps Klenau of the Army of Italy. After the war in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in Moravia and Silesia. He died in 1819. Family and early career Benatek Castle, in Bohemia, where Klenau was born. Johann Josef Cajetan von Klenau und Janowitz was born into an old Bohemian nobile family at Benatek Castle(; ) in the Habsburg province of Bohemia on 13 April 1758. The family of Klenau dates to the fifteenth century, and the family of Janowitz to the fourteenth. Friedrich Bernau. Studien und Materialien zur Specialgeschichte und Heimatskunde des deutschen Sprachgebiets in B√∂hmen und M√§hren. Prague: J.G. Calve, 1903, pp. 7‚Äì8, 151‚Äì165, 601. Other sources date the Klenau family to the early twelfth century. See Norbert (or Enoch) Heermann, Johann Matth√§us Klimesch, and V√°clav B≈ôezan. Norbert Heermann's Rosenberg'sche chronik. Prag, K√∂ngl. B√∂hmische gesellschaft der wissenschaften, 1897, p. 102. The family name of Klenau regularly appears in records after the sixteenth century. The Klenau family was one of the oldest dynasties in Bohemia, and many of the noble families of Bohemia have sprung from marriages into the Klenau line. The original name of the family was Przibik, with the predicate von Klenowa. The family was raised to the baronetcy in 1623 with the certificate granted to one Johann von Klenowa and, in 1629, to his son, Wilhelm. The Imperial councilor and judge in Regensburg, Wilhelm von Klenau, was raised to comital status in 1630, and to the status of Reichsgraf, or imperial count, in 1633.Contemporaries of Johann von Klenau included a cousin, Ignaz, born in Nieder√∂sterreich (Lower Austria) who entered the Maria Theresa Military Academy in 1778, was listed in the ranks as a cadet in 1779, and who disappeared from the muster lists in 1795.

A Colonel- Inhaber/Colonel Proprietor was originally a noble (or wealthy aristocrat) who raised the regiment. Subsequently, a noble or an officer who had achieved some distinction was appointed to the regimental position as an \\"honorary\\" appointment. If the appointment was honorary, a \\"second\\" colonel was appointed who would fulfill the duties of the colonel. Stephen Herold. The Austrian Army in 1812.

After transferring to a Chevauleger regiment as a Rittmeister, or captain of cavalry, Klenau fought in the short War of the Bavarian Succession, also known as the Potato War. Most of this conflict occurred in Bohemia (part of the modern Czech Republic) from 1778 to 1779, between the Habsburg Monarchy, Saxony, Bavaria and Prussia. The war had no battles, but was instead a series of skirmishes and raids, making it the ideal situation for a captain of light cavalry. In their raids, forces from both sides sought to confiscate or destroy the other's provisions, fodder, and materiel.Marshall Dill. Germany: a modern history. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1970, p. 52. In the Austro‚ÄìTurkish War (1787‚Äì1791), one of the House of Habsburg's many 18th-century wars with the Ottoman Empire, Klenau served in the 26th Dragoon Regiment Toscana, and later transferred to the 1st Dragoon Regiment Kaiser. His regiment repulsed an attack of superior numbers of Ottoman forces on 28 September 1788, at Zemun, near Belgrade, for which he received a personal commendation and earned his promotion to major. In his early military career Klenau demonstrated, not only at Zemun but also in the earlier skirmishing and raids of 1778 and 1779, the attributes required of a successful cavalry officer: the military acumen to evaluate a situation, the flexibility to adjust his plans on a moment's notice, and the personal courage to take the same risks he demanded of his men. Jens-Florian Ebert. \\"General der Kavallerie Graf von Klenau\\". French Revolutionary Wars=Background= Initially, the rulers of Europe considered the 1789 revolution in France as an affair between the French king and his subjects, and not a matter in which they should interfere. However, as the rhetoric grew more strident after 1790, the European monarchs began to view the French upheavals with alarm. Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who feared for the life and well-being of his sister, the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. In August 1791, in consultation with French √©migr√© nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, pp. 41‚Äì59. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French √©migr√©s agitated for support of a counter-revolution.Chief among them were the Prince of Cond√©, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke of Enghien. See Blanning, p. 44. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French‚ÄìGerman border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria and its allies. In this War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her. Portugal and the Ottoman Empire also joined the alliance against France.Blanning, pp. 44‚Äì59. =Klenau and the War of the First Coalition= On 12 February 1793, Klenau received his promotion to lieutenant colonel in a Lancer regiment, and joined the Austrian force in the Rhineland, serving under General of Cavalry Count Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. He was captured later in the spring near the town of Offenbach, but was freed unexpectedly by two Austrian Hussars from the 17th Regiment Archduke Alexander Leopold, who came upon him and his captors. At the first Battle of Wissembourg, Klenau commanded a brigade in Friedrich, Baron von Hotze's 3rd Column on 13 October 1793, during which the Habsburg force stormed the earthen ramparts held by the French.Digby Smith. \\"Wissembourg.\\" The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998, , p. 58. By the terms of the Peace of Basel (22 July 1795), the Prussian army was to leave the Rhine and Main river valleys; as it did so, the French quickly overran these territories. On 20 September, the fortress at Mannheim surrendered to the French without firing a shot.Wolfgang Menzel. Germany from the Earliest Period. Mrs. George Horrocks, trans. German 4th edition, London: Bohn, 1849, pp. 36‚Äì39. Mannheim had been garrisoned by a Bavarian commander, Lieutenant General Baron von Belderbusch, and several battalions of Bavarian grenadiers, fusiliers, and guard regiments, plus six companies of artillery. A small Austrian force augmented the Bavarian contingent. At the same time, further north, the fortified town of D√ºsseldorf, also garrisoned by Bavarians, capitulated to the French. With these capitulations, the French controlled the Rhine crossings at D√ºsseldorf and at the junction of the Rhine and the Main rivers. To maintain contact with the forces on their flanks, the Austrian commanders, outraged at this fait accompli, had to withdraw across the Main river.Smith. \\"Mannheim\\". Data Book. p. 105. The nearby city of Heidelberg, further south of the Main on the Neckar River, appeared to be the next French target. Lieutenant Field Marshal Peter Quasdanovich,There are various spellings of his name: Quosdanovich is also a common spelling. Smith, Data Book. p. 105. who had remained in the region between Mannheim and Heidelberg, used a hastily enhanced abatis to establish a defensive line at the sleepy country village of Handschuhsheim, east of the city of Heidelberg.

The French force of two divisions‚Äîabout 12,000 men‚Äîoutnumbered the 8,000 defenders, and the position seemed untenable. Klenau's charge Klenau's charge at Handschuhsheim won the day. At Handschuhsheim, Klenau commanded a mounted brigade that included the six squadrons of the 4th Cuirassiers Regiment Hohenzollern, two squadrons of the 3rd Dragoon Regiment Kaiser, six squadrons of the 44th Hussar regiment Szeckler, and four squadrons of the French √©migr√© regiment Allemand. On 24 September 1795, seeing the French, with five battalions and a regiment of Chasseurs overwhelming the troops of General Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza, Klenau quickly organized his own brigade into three columns and attacked. In a battle-winning charge, Klenau's brigade (approximately 4,000 men) dispersed the French divisions of Charles Pichegru's Army of the Upper Rhine, under the command of General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour. His cavalry caught Dufour's entire division in the open, dispersed Dufour's six squadrons of Chasseurs, and cut down Dufour's infantry. With a loss of 193 men and 54 horses, the Austrians inflicted over 1,500 French casualties, including 1,000 killed; they also captured eight guns, nine ammunition caissons and their teams, and General Dufour himself. Jaromir Hirtenfeld. Der milit√§r-Maria- Theresien-Orden und seine Mitglieder: nach authentischen Quellen bearbeitet. Wien: Hofdruckerie, 1857, p. 895. There is some disagreement on the actual numbers. Smith, \\"Handschuhsheim.\\" Data Book, p. 105, maintains that Dufour was captured; in Kudrna and Smith,\\"Quosdanovich\\", Smith states that Dufour was killed, although most encyclopedic sources list his dates as 1758‚Äì1820; furthermore, Smith himself also places Dufour at the Siege of H√ºningen, which lasted from late October 1796 to early February 1797. There, Dufour replaced Abatucci, the French commander who was killed in one of the Austrian attempts to overwhelm the garrison. According to the Biographie universelle, Dufour died in 1820.

In the action, General of Brigade Dusirat was wounded, as was Dufour before his capture. Additional Austrian losses included 35 men and 58 horses killed, six officers, 144 men and 78 horses wounded, and two men and three horses missing.

In 1796, Klenau commanded the advance guard of Peter Quasdanovich's right column in northern Italy. As the column descended from the Alps at the city of Brescia, reconnaissance found the local French garrison unprepared. At midnight, Klenau led two squadrons of the 8th Hussar Regiment Wurmser (named for its Colonel-Proprietor Dagobert von Wurmser), a battalion of the 37th Infantry Regiment De Vins, and one company of the Mahony J√§ger. With their approach masked by fog and darkness, the small force surprised the Brescia garrison on the morning of 30 July, capturing not only the 600‚Äì700 French soldiers stationed there, but also three officials of the French Directory: Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, and Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann.Martin Boycott-Brown. The Road to Rivoli. London: Cassell & Co., 2001. , p. 382; Smith, Battles of \\"Lonato\\" and \\"Castiglione delle Stiviere,\\" p. 119. However, within two days, Klenau's force had to face Napoleon Bonaparte and 12,000 Frenchmen; his small advance guard was quickly pushed out of Brescia on 1 August. At the subsequent Battle of Lonato of 2‚Äì3 August 1796, the French forced Quasdanovich's column to withdraw into the mountains. This isolated Quasdanovich's force from Wurmser's main army by Lake Garda, and freed the French to concentrate on the main force at Castiglione delle Stiviere, further south; Bonaparte's victory at the Battle of Castiglione forced Wurmser across the Mincio River, and allowed the French to return to the siege of Mantua.Smith, Battles of \\"Lonato\\" and \\"Castiglione delle Stiviere,\\" Data Book. p. 119. By early September, Klenau's force had rejoined Wurmser's column and fought at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Here, the Austrians were outnumbered almost two to one by the French. As the Austrian army retreated, Bonaparte ordered a pursuit that caused the Austrians to abandon their artillery and baggage. Most of the third battalion of the 59th Jordis, and the first battalion of the Border Infantry Banat were captured and these units ceased to exist after this battle. The Austrians lost 600 killed and wounded, and 2,000 captured, plus lost 30 guns, eight colors, and 200 limbers and ammunition waggons.Smith, \\"Bassano,\\" Data Book. p. 123. Klenau was with Wurmser's column again as it fought its way to besieged Mantua and he participated in the combat at La Favorita near there on 15 September. This was the second attempt to relieve the fortress; as the Austrians withdrew from the battle, they retreated into Mantua itself, and from 15 September until 2 February 1797, Klenau was trapped in the fortress while the city was besieged. Klenau (ADB). Following the Austrian loss at the Battle of Rivoli, north of Mantua, on 14‚Äì15 January 1797,At the Battle of Rivoli, 22,000 French overwhelmed 28,000 Austrians; the Austrians lost 4,000 killed or wounded, and 8,000 prisoners, including 11 colors and standards. Three Austrian units (i.e., two battalions of the Nr. 14 Klebek and a battalion of the J√§gerkorps Kurz) were captured in their entirety. Smith, p. 131. when clearly there would be no Austrian relief for Mantua, Klenau negotiated conditions of surrender with French General Jean S√©rurier,Boycott-Brown. p. 521. although additional evidence suggests that Bonaparte was present and dictated far more generous terms than Klenau expected.John Ashton. English caricature and satire on Napoleon I. London: Chatto & Windus, 1888, p. 39. When the garrison capitulated in February, Klenau co-signed the document with Wurmser. =Peace and the Congress of Rastatt= Although the Coalition forces‚ÄîAustria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others‚Äîhad achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and W√ºrzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements were more limited. In northern Italy, despite the presence of the most experienced of the Austrian generals‚ÄîDagobert Wurmser‚Äîthe Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.Blanning, pp. 41‚Äì59. The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details. These were to be convened at a small town in the upper Rhine valley, Rastatt, close to the French border. The primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of each other's motives, and the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory than originally agreed. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. The Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed-upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.Blanning, pp. 230‚Äì232. This gem-studded 1765 exemplar of the Commanders' Cross is engraved with the word FORTITUDE. Other factors contributed to the rising tensions. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English actually discussed this possibility.John Gallagher. Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme. Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, p. 70. =Outbreak of war in 1799= Archduke Charles of Austria, arguably among the best commanders of the House of Habsburg in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,Michael Hochedlinger. Austria's Wars of Emergence 1683‚Äì1797. London: Pearson, 2003, , p. 439. had taken command of the Austrian army in late January. Although Charles was unhappy with the strategy set by his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, he had acquiesced to the less ambitious plan to which Francis and his advisers, the Aulic Council, had agreed: Austria would fight a defensive war and would maintain a continuous defensive line from the southern bank of the Danube, across the Swiss Cantons and into northern Italy. The archduke had stationed himself at Friedberg for the winter, east-south-east of Augsburg. His army settled into cantonments in the environs of Augsburg, extending south along the Lech river.Blanning, p. 232; Gunther E. Rothenberg.

As winter broke in 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl.John Young, D.D.

Edinburgh: Turnbull, 1802, vol. 2, p. 220 Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, and use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.Rothenberg, pp. 70‚Äì74. The Army of the Danube advanced through the Black Forest and eventually established a line from Lake Constance to the south bank of the Danube, centered at the Imperial City of Pfullendorf in Upper Swabia.Rothenberg, pp. 49‚Äì50. At the same time, the Army of Switzerland, under command of Andr√© Mass√©na, pushed toward the Grisons, intending to cut the Austrian lines of communication and relief at the mountain passes by Luziensteig and Feldkirch. The Army of Italy, commanded by Louis Joseph Sch√©rer, had already advanced into northern Italy, to deal with Ferdinand and the recalcitrant Neapolitans.Blanning, p. 232. =Campaigns of 1799‚Äì1800= At the onset of the 1799 campaign in Italy, Klenau and his 4,500 troopsThe 8th Hussar Regiment, two battalions of Banaters from the Austrian border with the Ottoman Empire, and a battalion of the 18th Infantry.

Klenau's troops, especially some of his Italian-speaking officers, incited peasants against French authority, provided arms and suggested military targets of opportunity, and incorporated the Austrian-armed peasants into their military actions. Klenau's siege of Ferrara The French commander took refuge in the fortress at Ferrara, from which it was difficult to dislodge him. Klenau captured the city first, then the fortress three days later. The Ferrara fortress had been constructed in the 16th century by Pope Paul V, built in the style of the Trace italienne, or a star, and it straddled the southwest corner of the town's fortifications. The fortress offered whoever possessed it a strategic point in the region: it was the lynch-pin of the French defense. In spring 1799, it was commanded by Chef-de-brigade Lapointe with a garrison of close to 2,500.Smith, \\"Brescia.\\" Data Book, p. 156, says that the garrison was only 1500 men and 75 guns; Acerbi maintains it was considerably higher: 700 regulars and 1959 Civic Guards; see also Acerbi, The 1799 Campaign in Italy: Klenau and Ott Vanguards and the Coalition's Left Wing April‚ÄìJune 1799. On 15 April, Klenau approached the fortress and requested its capitulation. The commander refused. Klenau blockaded the city, leaving a small group of artillery and troops to continue the siege.Colonel Danilo Oreskovich and 1,300 Croatians of the 2nd Banat battalion, 4,000 Ferrarese auxiliary troops commanded by Count Antonio Gardani, and several hundred local peasants commanded by Major Angelo Pietro Poli.Acerbi. The 1799 Campaign in Italy: Klenau and Ott Vanguards and the Coalition's Left Wing April‚ÄìJune 1799. For the next three days, Klenau patrolled the countryside, capturing the surrounding strategic points of Lagoscuro, Borgoforte and the Mirandola fortress. The besieged garrison made several sorties from the Saint Paul's Gate, which were repulsed by the insurgent peasants. The French attempted two rescues of the beleaguered fortress: In the first, on 24 April, a force of 400 Modenese was repulsed at Mirandola. In the second, General Montrichard tried to raise the city blockade by advancing with a force of 4,000. Finally, at the end of the month, a column of Pierre-Augustin Hulin reached and resupplied the fortress.Acerbi, The 1799 Campaign in Italy: Klenau and Ott Vanguards and the Coalition's Left Wing April‚ÄìJune 1799. Klenau took possession of the town on 21 May, and garrisoned it with a light battalion. The Jewish residents of Ferrara paid 30,000 ducats to prevent the pillage of the city by Klenau's forces; this was used to pay the wages of Gardani's troops.Accerbi reports that wages were the equivalent of a daily intake of 21 \\"Baiocchi\\" in cash and four in bread. Acerbi, The 1799 Campaign in Italy: Klenau and Ott Vanguards and the Coalition's Left Wing April‚ÄìJune 1799. Although Klenau held the town, the French still possessed the town's fortress. After making the standard request for surrender at 0800, which was refused, Klenau ordered a barrage from his mortars and howitzers. After two magazines caught fire, the commandant was summoned again to surrender; there was some delay, but a flag of truce was sent at 2100, and the capitulation was concluded at 0100 the next day. Upon taking possession of the fortress, Klenau found 75 new artillery pieces, plus ammunition and six months' worth of provisions.Acerbi, The 1799 Campaign in Italy: Klenau and Ott Vanguards and the Coalition's Left Wing April‚ÄìJune 1799; Klenau's force included a battalion of light infantry, a couple battalions of border infantry, a squadron of the Nauendorf Hussars (8th Hussars), and approximately 4,000 armed peasants. For details on Austrian force, see Smith, Ferrara, Data Book, p. 156. The peasant uprisings pinned down the French and, by capturing Ferrara, Klenau helped to isolate the other French-held fortresses from patrols, reconnaissance, and relief and supply forces. This made the fortresses and their garrisons vulnerable to Suvorov's main force, operating in the Po River valley. In the course of the summer, Suvorov's forces took a key position on the Tidone River on 17 June 1799, west of Piacenza, another at the junction of the Trebbia River and the Po, in northern Italy, on 17‚Äì20 June 1799, and the town of Novi Ligure on 15 August 1799, southeast of Alessandria on the Tanaro river.Smith, Data Book, pp. 159‚Äì163.

The 1800 campaign in southwest Germany began on 1 May 1800, at the village of B√ºsingen, east of Schaffhausen (Switzerland); there a small force of 6,000 men under command of General of Brigade Fran√ßois Goullus defeated 4,000 men, three battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment Schr√∂der, commanded by Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Eugen, Prince von Lothringen-Lambesc.Smith reports French losses at approximately 500, and Austrian losses at 400, plus 750 captured, and three guns lost. Smith, \\"Busingen.\\"Data Book, p. 181. Following this clash, the impenetrable W√ºrttemberg fortress, Hohentwiel, capitulated to the French, in what the Duke of W√ºrttemberg considered a scandalous lack of military courage.Smith, Battles at \\"Engen,\\" \\"Stockach (2nd)\\", and \\"Messkirch,\\" Data Book, p. 181. General of Division Vandamme appeared with approximately 9,600 infantry and 504 cavalry, and the 106-man garrison, under Major General George von Bilfinger, capitulated without resistance. The widowed Josephina (n√©e de Viseck) Somsich de Sard married Klenau in 1800. After these encounters, the French army moved toward Stockach, less than northwest of Hohentwiel, where they engaged the Austrian force, under Kray, in the battles of Engen and Stockach and Messkirch against the troops of the French Army of the Rhine, under Jean Victor Moreau. Ebert, \\"General der Kavallerie Graf von Klenau\\". Stockach, at the western tip of Lake Constance, covered east-west and north- south crossroads; it and near-by Engen, only west, had been the site of a French loss 14 months earlier. In 1800, a different general, Moreau, brought 84,000 troops against Kray's 72,000 men; this concentration of French force pushed the Austrian army eastward.Smith, \\"Stockach,\\" Data Book, p. 181. Smith reports that 397 Austrians were killed and wounded, 718 captured, and five guns and three colors lost. Two days later, at Messkirch northeast of Stockach, Moreau brought 52,000 men, including Claude Lecourbe's and Dominique Vandamme's divisions, which had experienced the disappointing French loss in 1799, and √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's experienced cavalry against Kray's force of 48,000. Although the French lost more men, once again they drove the Austrians from the field.Smith, \\"Messkirch,\\" Data Book,p. 182. Despite the Imperial losses at these battles, Klenau's solid field leadership led to his promotion to lieutenant field marshal. That year he also married the widowed Maria Josephina Somsich de Sard, daughter of Tallian de Viseck. They had one daughter, Maria, born at the end of the year.Maria von Klenau, born 17 December 1800, married Franz Joseph Siegmund von Riesch (1793‚Äì1830), the son of General of Cavalry (Austrian) Johann Sigismund Riesch: they had two children, Theodore (8 August 1819 ‚Äì ?) and Maria (9 October 1820 ‚Äì 18 November 1895).

From 1801 to 1805, during which Austria remained aloof from the ongoing friction between Britain and Napoleon's France, Klenau commanded a division in Prague, and was named as Colonel and Inhaber of the 5th Dragoon Regiment. Napoleonic Wars=Background= In a series of conflicts from 1803 to 1815, known as the Napoleonic Wars, the alliances of the powers of Europe formed five coalitions against the First French Empire of Napoleon. Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution of 1789, these wars revolutionized the construction, organization, and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to mass conscription. French power rose quickly, conquering most of Europe, but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813‚Äì1814 campaigns, resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication, and his banishment to the Island of Saint Helena, concluded the Napoleonic wars.Blanning, pp. 5‚Äì15. =War of the Third Coalition= In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803‚Äì1806, an alliance of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition.The Peace of Pressburg, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lun√©ville, required Austria to cede land to Napoleon's German allies, and imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the Habsburgs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and Prussia, Russia, and Austria. See David Gates. The Napoleonic Wars 1803‚Äì1815. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997, , pp. 23‚Äì27. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.Gates, p. 27. Danube campaign: Road to Ulm Upon Austria's entrance into the war in summer 1805, Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became mired in a short campaign that exposed the worst of the Habsburg military organization. Archduke Charles was sick, and had retired to recuperate. Archduke Ferdinand, the brother-in- law of the Emperor Francis, was theoretically in command, but Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement, having neither experience, maturity, nor aptitude. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, decisions were placed in the hands of Karl Mack, who was timid, indecisive, and ill-suited for such an important assignment. Furthermore, Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign, and was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able military officer, but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army.Frederick W Kagan. The End of the Old Order. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press 2006, , pp. 236‚Äì239; Smith, pp. 203‚Äì204. The capture of a unit's guidon, or standard, and the Imperial eagle, was an honor to the unit that captured it and a disgrace to the unit that lost it. The campaign began in October, with several clashes in Swabia. At the first, near the Bavarian town of Wertingen, northwest of Augsburg, on 8 October, Murat's Cavalry Corps and grenadiers of Lannes' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half their size. The Austrians had assembled in line, and the cavalry and grenadiers cut them down before the Austrians could form their defensive squares. Nearly 3,000 were captured.Smith, \\"1805 Campaign,\\" Data Book, p. 203. A day later, at G√ºnzburg immediately south of the Danube, the French again met an Austrian force; General Mack could not decide on a plan, and the French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube, and, in a humiliating episode, chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm. In this action, the French secured an important bridgehead on the Danube River.Smith, \\"1805 Campaign,\\" Data Book, pp. 203‚Äì204. With the string of French victories, Lieutenant Field Marshal Klenau provided the only ray of hope in a campaign fraught with losses. At Ulm-Jungingen, Klenau had arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, an over- confident General of Division Dupon de l'√âtang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men. The French lost 1,500 dead and wounded, 900 captured, 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons captured, but possibly of greater significance, the Imperial Eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th Dragoons were taken by the Austrians.Smith, \\"Haslach,\\" Data Book, pp. 203‚Äì204. Despite Klenau's success at the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen, the Austrians could not sustain their positions around him, and the entire line retreated toward Ulm. Napoleon's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian weaknesses, particularly of indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. The Austrians were low on ammunition and outgunned. The components of the army, division by division, were being separated from one another. Morale sank, \\"sapped by Mack's chaotic orders and their [the troops] growing lack of confidence in their nominal commander,\\" Ferdinand.Smith, \\"Memmingen\\", Data Book, p. 204. Following the Austrian capitulation at Memmingen, south of Ulm, the French achieved a morale boost over the Austrians at the Battle of Elchingen, outside of Biberach, on 14 October. Here, northeast of Ulm, and slightly north of the Danube, Ney's VI Corps (20,000 men) captured half of the Austrian Reserve Artillery park at Thalfingen. In a further blow, Field Marshal Riesch was unable to destroy the Danube bridges, which Ney secured for the French. Ney received the victory title, Duke of Elchingen.Smith, \\"Elchingen\\", Data Book, p. 204. At this point, the entire Austrian force, including Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm and its environs and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, as he had been at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry.Smith, \\"Ulm\\", Data Book, p. 205; and Klenau (ADB). Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.Smith, \\"Ulm,\\" Data Book, p. 205. General Mack and his staff surrender the Ulm fortress. Painting by Charles Th√©venin =Action on the Danube by Vienna= The Austrians abstained from the fighting in 1806‚Äì1808, and engaged in a military reorganization, directed by Archduke Charles.James Allen Vann. \\"Habsburg Policy and the Austrian War of 1809.\\" Central European History, Vol. 7, No. 4 (December 1974), pp. 291‚Äì310, cited pp. 297‚Äì298. When they were ready to join the fight against France, in the spring and summer of 1809, it was a remodeled Austrian army that took the field. Despite their internal military reorganization, however, in the War of the Fifth Coalition, the army retained much of its cumbersome command structure, which complicated the issuance of orders and the timely distribution of troops. When the Austrian army took the field in 1809, it battled for the \\"survival of the [Habsburg] dynasty,\\" as Archduke Charles, the army's supreme commander, described the situation to his brother John.Alan Sked. \\"Historians, the Nationality Question, and the Downfall of the Habsburg Empire.\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fifth Series, Vol. 31, (1981), pp. 175‚Äì193, p. 176. On the Danubian plains north of Vienna, the summer battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram shaped the outcome of the 1809 campaign. Klenau's forces played a critical role at both. At Aspern-Essling, Napoleon's army was decisively defeated for the first time in northern Europe, demonstrating that the master of Europe could himself be mastered.Robert B. Bruce, et al., Fighting techniques of the Napoleonic Age, 1792‚Äì1815. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martin's Press, 2008, 978-0312375874 p. 154. Digby Smith points out that Napoleon had been defeated at Bassano, Caldiero, and Acre in 1796, 1796 and 1799, respectively. Smith, \\"Aspern-Essling,\\" Data Book, p. 310; others have pointed out that these defeats occurred before Napoleon became Emperor. After their defeat at Wagram, the Austrians withdrew into Moravia, leaving the French in control of that part of the Danube valley; Wagram was the largest European land-battle to date, engaging 262 battalions and 202 squadrons‚Äî153,000 men‚Äîfor France and her allies, and 160 battalions and 150 squadrons‚Äî135,000 men‚Äîon the Austrian side.Ian Castle.

For Klenau, the campaign started badly at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl (sometimes called Eggm√ºhl), in southeastern Germany on 22 April 1809. Klenau commanded the Advance Guard, which included the 2nd Archduke Charles Legion, the Merveldt Uhlanen and a cavalry battery.John Gill, Thunder on the Danube Napoleon's Defeat of the Habsburgs, London: Frontline Books, 2008, , Volume 1, p. 355. Archduke Charles misread Napoleon's intentions and lost the advantage in the battle. Klenau's division suffered heavily and the Archduke Charles Legion was nearly wiped out in a charge by Louis Friant's cavalry.Gill, p. 281. Rosenberg's division on Klenau's flank was also badly mauled and suffered heavy casualties: 534 killed, 637 wounded, 865 missing, and 773 captured.Smith, \\"Eckm√ºhl\\", Data Book, p. 292. The disaster at Eckm√ºhl was followed by another at Regensburg (also called the Battle of Ratisbon) on 23 April, where Klenau, at the head of six squadrons of Merveldt's Uhlanen (lancers), was crushed and scattered by √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's heavy cavalry.Gill, pp. 289‚Äì290. Klenau and Major General Peter V√©csey stormed back at Nansouty's force with the Klenau chevauxlegers. Although their onslaught threw back the leading French squadrons, the French heavy cavalry returned, joined by Hussars and Chasseurs. In the m√™lee, it was difficult to distinguish French from Austrian, but eventually the French horse overwhelmed the Austrian flank and pushed them to the gates of Regensburg.Gill, p. 291. Aspern and Essling By May 1809, the Austrians were pushed to within visual distance of Vienna, and in a critical engagement on the banks of the Danube river, the French and their allies grappled for control of the Marchfeld plain with the Austrians. The French held Lobau island, a vital river crossing, and the Austrians held the heights further to the east. Between them lay several villages, two of which were central in the engagement and gave the battle its name: They lay so close to Vienna that the battle could be seen and heard from the city ramparts and Aspern and Essling (also spelled in German as E√üling) are today part of the Donaustadt, a district of Austrian capital. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Klenau commanded a free-standing force of close to 6,000, including a battalion of the 1st J√§ger, three battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment Archduke Charles, eight squadrons each of the Stipcisc Hussars and Schwarzenburg Uhlans, and a horse artillery battery of 64 guns. Typical confusion in the Austrian command structure meant he received his orders late, and Klenau's delay in deployment meant that his men approached the French III Corps at Essling in daylight and in close order; a two-gun French battery on the plain beyond the Essling, \\"mowed furrows\\" of enfilade fire in the Austrian ranks.James R. Arnold. Napoleon Conquers Austria: the 1809 campaign for Vienna, Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1995, , p. 143, see p. 204 for the Order of Battle; Rothenburg, pp. 188‚Äì189. Despite the withering fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, where his men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French for nearly an hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat.Arnold, p. 143‚Äì144. Arnold refers to the complete disorder in the French ranks in the face of the Austrian advance, which did not falter, even under the enfilade fire. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions in the second and third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Mass√©na cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Mass√©na was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.Gilles Bou√©. The Battle of Essling: Napoleon's first defeat? Alan McKay, Translator. Elkar, Spain: Histoire & Collections, 2008. . pp. 35‚Äì38. Meanwhile, Napoleon had launched an attack on the main army at the Austrian center. Klenau's force stood on the immediate right flank of the center, opposite the attacking force of Lannes. The French cavalry, in reserve, prepared to move at either flank, or to the center, depending on where the Austrian line broke first. The French nearly broke through at the center but, at the last minute, Charles arrived with his last reserve, leading his soldiers with a color in his hand. Lannes was checked, and the impetus of the attack died out all along the line. In the final hours of the battle, Lannes himself was cut down by a cannonball from Klenau's artillery. Aspern was lost to the French. The Danube bridges upon which the French relied had been cut again by heavy barges, which the Austrians had released on the river. When he lost his route across the river, Napoleon at once suspended the attack. For his leadership at Essling, Klenau received the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Klenau's grenadiers fought the French in Essling in hand-to-hand combat. Both sides lost close to 28,000 men, to wounds and death. For Napoleon, whose force was smaller, the losses were more costly. For Charles, the victory, which occurred within visual range of the Vienna ramparts, won him support from the hawks, or the pro-war party, in the Hofburg.Rothenburg, pp. 188‚Äì189. The Austrian victory at Aspern-Essling proved that Napoleon could be beaten. His force had been divided (Davout's corps had never made it over the Danube), and Napoleon had underestimated the Austrian strength of force and, more importantly, the tenacity the Austrians showed in situations like that of Essling, when Klenau marched his force across open country under enemy fire. After Aspern-Essling, Napoleon revised his opinion of the Austrian soldier.Peter Hicks. The Battle of Aspern-Essling Napoleon Foundation, 2008. Retrieved 9 December 2009. Wagram In the lull between the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram (5‚Äì6 July) Charles ordered the construction of a several-mile-long entrenchment, but did little else to shore up his force. Conversely, on the other side of the Danube, Napoleon brought in additional troops from Italy and Hungary. The day prior to the battle at Wagram, Klenau replaced General Johann von Hiller, who had fallen ill, to command the 13,740 soldiers of VI Corps, and Armand von Nordmann replaced him as commander of the Advance Guard.Bruce et al., p. 154; Castle. The Battle of Wagram. Klenau's Corps stood about ahead of the main Austrian force. The Corps, about 8,000 men, were ordered to oppose any French advance on the Marchfeld plain. By mid-afternoon, Klenau could see Napoleon's massive force advancing toward them through the cornfields. Klenau managed a spirited, and gradual withdrawal to a position behind the Austrian line at the Russbach, and above the Wagram escarpment; this exposed several of the villages on the western edge of the Marchfield Plain, including Aspern and Essling, to French capture.Castle, The Battle of Wagram On the next day of battle, Klenau was ordered to a forward position, to complete a double- envelopment of Napoleon's force, envisioned by Charles as the best means of inducing panic among the French troops. At dawn, or so, at 0400, his cannonade rained havoc on Boudet's division of Massena's IV Corps; Massena sent another division under Claude Legrand to support Boudet. Klenau's corps managed to retake both Essling and Aspern, without the same vigorous contest that had occurred two months earlier. Half the pincer movement was well underway, although Klenau's force could not move further ahead: The guns on the Island of Lobau prevented further advance. There was no support from Kollorat's forces on his flank, and for the closing prong of the pincer movement, Archduke John was no where in sight; he had not abandoned his baggage, and was plodding slowly, with his army, toward the battlefield, but still a good day's march away.Gregory Fremont-Barnes. The Napoleonic Wars: the rise and fall of an empire. Oxford: Osprey, 2004, , pp. 138‚Äì143 Despite the mile-long gap in the French line, and the advance of Austrian cavalry, Klenau's men could not hold them against Andr√© Mass√©na's prolonged mid-day assault.Castle, The Battle of Wagram; Fr√©d√©ric Naulet, Wagram, 5‚Äì6 juillet 1809, Une victoire ch√®rement acquise, Collections Grandes Batailles, Napol√©on Ier √âditions, 2009, p. 70 Charles watched from his command post at Wagram as Klenau's forces stubbornly clung to their positions, but were overwhelmed by the inexorable progress of Mass√©na's troops, what Klenau later called Mass√©na's Infernal Column.Bruce, p. 155; Arnold, p. 162. Klenau organized the rear guard for the Army's retreat into Moravia, and lost 15 percent of his force. General Ren√© Savary, who directed part of the French pursuit, wrote that the Klenau's soldiers had \\"fought in a manner calculated to instill a cautious conduct into any man disposed to deeds of rashness.\\"Peter Hofschroer, M. Townsend, et al. \\"Battle of Wagram 1809\\". Napoleon, His Army and Enemies.'.' Retrieved 7 December 2009 =Aftermath= Klenau's force bore the brunt of Murat's cavalry charge at the Battle of Dresden. As a consequence, Austria withdrew from the Coalition. Although France had not completely defeated them, the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.Chandler. p. 732. War of Liberation 1813 Napoleon engaged in his disastrous Russian campaign in 1812; by 1813, the military landscape was dramatically different. Prussia was the first to defect from Napoleon's cause; possibly the arrival of the remnants of the Grande Arm√©e in Berlin convinced the Prussian leadership that it was not only safe, but expedient. The remains of Napoleon's invasion force staggered back from Russia in early 1813 in appalling condition. Of the I Corps, only 2,281 men of the original 70,000 could be mustered. The Imperial Guard strength fell from 50,000 to 1,533, and 200 of those were disabled by amputation, frostbite, or injuries.Gates, p. 221. Some historians suggest that the nature of the opposition to Napoleon changed in these few months, from opposition by dynasties to opposition by whole peoples, giving the War of the Sixth Coalition its nationalist character.F.L. Petre. Napoleon's last campaign in Germany: 1813. London. 1974 edition. p. 224 By the end of April, French forces gained control of Leipzig. At L√ºtzen, on 2 May Napoleon lured a combined Prussian and Russian force into a trap. The Russian commander, Peter Wittgenstein, ignored the primary directive of the Trachenberg plan, attempting to undo Napoleon's capture of Leipzig. After a day of heavy fighting, the combined forces retreated. A few weeks later, at the Battle of Bautzen, 20‚Äì21 May 1813, the combined Russian and Prussian force surprised Ney's corps in a confused assault, which narrowly escaped destruction when Napoleon appeared with reinforcements. The outwitted Bl√ºcher and Wittgenstein escaped because Michel Ney failed to block the retreat.Gates, pp. 235‚Äì242 Despite his string of victories, Napoleon sought an armistice in early June, to allow a series of negotiations, to take place in Prague.Gates, p. 243 The Armistice of Poischwitz, signed 4 June 1813, established a cease-fire throughout central and eastern Europe that was intended to last until mid- July; the combatants had to give six days' notice of its termination.Thomas Henry Dyer. Modern Europe from the fall of Constantinople to the establishment of the German Empire, A.D. 1453‚Äì1871. London: G. Bell & Sons, 1877. p. 331 The various interested parties‚ÄîRussian, Prussian, Austrian, Saxon, Swedish, Bavarian, British and others‚Äîexplored the possibilities of new alliances.Digby Smith. 1813: Leipzig Napoleon and the Battle of Nations, PA: Stackpole Books, 2001, , pp. 13‚Äì15 =Changes in Coalition Strategy= While delegates bickered in Prague, similar to the situation in Rastatt in 1799, the diplomats negotiated throughout the war zone and in the capitals of Europe, to create a new set of alliances. The subsequent Sixth Coalition (Russia, Prussia, Britain, Sweden and, eventually, Austria), differed significantly from the earlier coalitions. Unlike previous coalitions in which the participants had organized their armies independently of one another, the Allies of the Sixth Coalition created multi-national armies. This theoretically accomplished two goals: Napoleon could not defeat them piecemeal, and the presence of soldiers from several states within a single armed force limited \\"politically motivated acts of national self-interest.\\"Michael V. Leggiere. \\"From Berlin to Leipzig: Napoleon's Gamble in North Germany, 1813.\\" The Journal of Military History, Vol. 67, No. 1 (January 2003), pp. 39‚Äì84, p. 64. Klenau, promoted to General der Kavallerie (full general) on 26 July 1813, held command of an independent corps in the Army of Bohemia. This Army of Bohemia illustrated one of the biggest differences in the Sixth Coalition's organizational schema: it included 127,435 Austrians, 78,200 Russians, and 44,907 Prussians.Smith, \\"Leipzig,\\" Data Book, pp. 466, 470. The Coalition also pursued a different operational plan. The Coalition's operational strategy brought its different forces closer and closer together in concentric circles, to a single point in Saxony. Known as the Trachenberg Plan, the Sixth Coalition's operating plan established clear, concise and specific guidelines for commanders, from the Army through the basic company level: act offensively against an inferior foe; act defensively against a superior foe, underscoring to commanders at all levels the risk of underestimating the threat of Napoleon and his army. The new plan divided the Allied force into three armies: Silesia, Bohemia, and Northern Germany. The Silesian army, composed of Prussians and Russians, left 50,000 men in the Province of Silesia and moved the remaining 100,000 to join with 120,000 Austrians in Saxony. The Crown Prince of Sweden, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, a former Marshal of France and a favorite of Napoleon's, established an army of observation at Hamburg and L√ºbeck, and another 70,000 concentrated southwest of Berlin. Using this plan, the Coalition pushed Napoleon and his allies into an increasingly smaller circle of operation. In theory, while this concentrated Napoleon's force, it also limited his maneuvering options. Furthermore, it concentrated the Coalition forces around the French and Allied armies, ultimately at the Saxon cities of Dresden, and then Leipzig.Smith. 1813. pp. 13‚Äì15 =Battle of Dresden= Strategically, the Battle of Dresden demonstrated the problems of the Coalition's strategy. On 25 August, the three monarchs‚ÄîAlexander II of Russia, Francis II of Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia‚Äîand their staffs assembled on an overlook of the city to discuss their strategy. The city's weak defenses were clear from this vantage point: the French and Saxon garrison of 20,000 men under Marshal Saint-Cyr could not hope to hold a city of that size. The Tsar and General Jean Victor Moreau, formerly a General of France and by 1813 an adviser to the Coalition, wanted to attack at once; Schwarzenberg wanted to wait until additional forces arrived.Smith. 1813. pp. 18‚Äì21 A cavalry charge at the Battle of Dresden, 1813 By waiting one day, the Coalition lost the advantage. As the Coalition assaulted the southern suburbs of the city, Napoleon arrived from the north and west with the Guard and Marmont's VI Corps, covering in forced marches over three days. The leading elements of Klenau's corps were placed on the army's left flank, separated from the main body by the Wei√üeritz, flooded after almost a week of rain. Marshal Joachim Murat took advantage of this isolation and inflicted heavy losses on the Austrians.Chandler, pp. 910‚Äì911 A French participant observed, separating Klenau's corps from the Austrian army, Murat \\"hurl[ed] himself upon it at the head of the carabineers and cuirassiers. His movement was decisive; Klenau could not resist that terrible charge. Nearly all his battalions were compelled to lay down their arms, and two other divisions of infantry shared their fate.\\"Marbot, Jean-Baptiste Antoine Marcellin. The Memoirs of General Baron De Marbot , Volume II,, Chapter 23. Electronic book widely available Murat captured intact a division of five infantry regiments (15,000 men) under command of Lieutenant Field Marshal Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Fels√∂-Kubiny, plus 15 of their regimental and company colors.Smith, p. 445. Mesko was wounded, and retired the following year. Kurdna and Smith, Mesko. The Colors are a set of large flags, unique to each regiment, and each unit, that the ordinary soldier would be able to identify as belonging to his unit. This helped to keep men organized on the battlefield. Woven into the colors are battle honors that the unit had received. The loss of the colors was an insult to the unit; to capture the colors was an honor to the captor. As the left wing disintegrated, the French swarmed over the flank; the right wing was also driven back, and the entire force had to withdraw.Gates, pp. 246‚Äì247 After the immediate defense of Dresden, though, Napoleon's situation deteriorated. Vandamme pursued the retreating Army of Bohemia, expecting to be supported by St. Cyr and General Marmont, who were still busy in Dresden. Vandamme approached the Russian corps commanded by Ostermann-Tolstoy, but left a valley behind him unprotected as he descended out of the mountain into Bohemia. As he engaged Ostermann-Tolstoy, he saw some troops behind him, which soon attacked him; thus beset from two sides, his young troops were unable to defend themselves; at the Battle of Kulm, Vandamme lost his entire artillery, and the Austrians acquired about 7,500 prisoners, including the general himself.Smith, 1813. p. 21; Gates, pp. 246‚Äì247 To the north of Dresden, as Napoleon appeared to be engaged, looking elsewhere, Bl√ºcher brought his troops south, toward the city. Realizing the danger, Napoleon directed his main army north again, to repel the Prussians; as he did so, the wiley Bl√ºcher withdrew. Other portions of the French army had comparable difficulties. Marshal Oudinot was repelled by Bernadotte at the Battle of Gro√übeeren, and MacDonald, near the Bober river. Furthermore, Napoleon began to suffer from illness, referred to variously as a colic or fatigue. =Battle of Leipzig= From 12 to 15 October, the days of skirmishing preliminary to the Battle of Leipzig (16‚Äì19 October), Klenau's forceKlenau commanded three divisions, including those of Josef, Baron von Mohr, Lieutenant Field Marshal Louis Aloys, Prince of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, and Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton von Mayer Heldensfeld Smith, \\"Leipzig,\\" Data Book, pp. 466, 470. took the heavily defended village Liebertwolkwitz, but were forced out in a French counter- attack. A contemporary witness later described finding dead Austrians at the church cemetery, pinned to the walls with bayonets.Smith. 1813. p. 50 Klenau's primary objective was the village of Liebertwolkwitz. He took the Kolmberg, a nearby height also known as the Schwedenschanze (Swedish fortification), a defensive remnant of the Thirty Years' War about east of the village, and established a battery there, but did not bring enough troops to support it. An attack by 4,000 of Jacques MacDonald's infantry secured the hill; although Klenau's cavalry managed to push the French back, they could not retake the hill. In the action, Klenau's own horse was shot and killed, and he was nearly captured, but he struggled back to his line, and reorganized his men.F. Loraine Petre. Napoleon's last campaign in Germany, 1813. London: John Lane Co., 1912, p. 335; Smith, 1813. pp. 118‚Äì119 Eventually, Klenau's corps took the village and the Kolmberg several times, to be pushed out by the French, to counter-attack, retreat, counter-attack and retreat and this see-sawing back and forth, the attacks, counter-attacks experienced by Klenau's force, were characteristic of the battle.Smith, 1813. p. 137. On the critical first day of the battle, 16 October, a French 100-gun artillery barrage forced a hole in the line between the Russian and Prussian forces on Klenau's flank. When Murat's cavalry charged the hole, Klenau's corps, plus reserve cavalry, eventually forced the Murat's troops back to the cover of the French artillery.Chandler, p. 929. Klenau's force made a short retreat, leaving a detachment at the Kolmberg. By mid-afternoon, the Allied columns had been driven to their starting positions, but had maintained their line; as one part of the line was forced back, its flanks dropped back with it, maintaining a continuous line and preventing a French flanking operation. In this first-day action, Klenau's force played a vital role in preventing MacDonald from flanking Prince Schwarzenberg's main army.Christopher Thomas Atkinson. A history of Germany, 1715‚Äì1815.

On the night of the 16th, the French controlled the Kolmberg that Klenau had fought over all day, and a Hessian soldier wrote: \\"it was the worst bivouac we had experienced on this campaign. The weather was wet and windy ... we had to use water from puddles in which lay the blood of men and horses ... and half the men remained under arms at all times.\\"Smith. 1813. p. 156. =Klenau and the Siege of Dresden= After the battle, the allied high command assigned Klenau to blockade the large French garrison at Dresden. His IV Austrian Corps of the Army of Bohemia included the division of Lt. General Alexander Ivanovich, Count Ostermann- Tolstoy, and the militia of Major General Alexey Nikolayevich Titov, a total of approximately 41,000 troops. Klenau eventually negotiated a capitulation in which the French troops would return to France with their honors, on condition that they would not fight against the Allies for six months. Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr surrendered to Klenau on 11 November, but Schwarzenburg refused to agree to the capitulation and the French troops marched into captivity into Austria instead. The victors took 94 French field guns and 151 Saxon fortress guns, and wrested from the French complete control over the Kingdom of Saxony.Smith, \\"Dresden\\", Data Book, p. 478; Smith, 1813. pp. 157‚Äì159 War in France 1814‚Äì1815 and post-war career { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Promotions * Major: 15 January 1790 * Lt.

The armies would be as many as apart. Their communications would be conducted through Wittgenstein's cavalry and some irregular cossacks, which was directly opposite to the Trachenberg plan. Schwarzenberg knew it was exactly what Napoleon would want them to do, but reluctantly agreed to it.Bl√ºcher was anxious to crush the French, Schwarzenberg less so. Digby Smith. Charge! Great cavalry charges of the Napoleonic Wars. London: Greenhill, 2007, p. 209. Afterward, Klenau commanded a corps in Italy, known as the Korps Klenau. After the war ended again in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in Moravia and Silesia. He held this office until his death on 6 October 1819 at Brno, in the modern-day Czech Republic.

Founded in 1973 as the Ukiyo-e Society of America by collectors of Japanese prints, the Society's mission has expanded to include related fields of Japanese art. History While the Society now addresses all aspects of Japanese art and culture, it traces its origins to a small group of ukiyo-e print collectors in and around New York City in 1973, at a time when Parke-Bernet Galleries (later to merge with Sotheby's) had begun to develop a market for Japanese art. The first major auction was the 1969 sale of the Blanche McFetridge estate, consisting of ukiyo-e prints once owned by Frank Lloyd Wright, followed by the 1972 sale of the estate of Hans Popper (1904‚Äì1971), a Viennese businessman who spent time working in Japan. His collection included masterpieces by Harunobu, Utamaro, Sharaku and Hokusai, and the sale attracted many of the great collectors and dealers of the era, including Richard Pillsbury Gale (1900‚Äì1973) in Minnesota, Felix Tikotin (1893‚Äì1986), a dealer living in Switzerland, and Nishi Saiju (1927‚Äì1995), the first Japanese dealer to attend a sale in the United States. JASA entered its fourth decade under the direction of Joan Baekeland as president, and the long-time Chicago collector George Mann as vice president. The current president is Dr. Susan Peters. Today, JASA has some 400 members from countries around the world, including Japan. Activities Through its annual lectures, seminars and other events, the Society provides a forum for the exchange ideas and experiences about traditional and contemporary arts of Japan. The Society also sponsors exhibitions, such as Designed for Pleasure: The World of Edo Japan in Prints and Paintings, 1680‚Äì1860,Asia Society Presents Major Exhibition of Japanese Woodblock Prints And Paintings which was shown at Asia Society in New York City in Spring 2008. Programs and publications Programs for members and the public remain the focus of the Society: in 2009, for example, members had tea in the Japanese teahouse at Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills near Tarrytown, New York; visited private and public collections in Sacramento and San Francisco; and toured the Richard Fishbein and Estelle Bender Collection as well as the mini-museum of the Mary Griggs Burke Collection in New York City. Lecture programs in New York are held at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts and elsewhere. The programs and publications of the Society were valuable in the 1970s, when ukiyo-e studies and, for that matter, Edo period art history had scarcely entered the academic mainstream either in the United States or Japan. The society publishes a quarterly newsletter for members as well as an annual journal, Impressions. ()Japanese Art Society publicationsArt Index, Jan. 2010, New York, H. W.

Johnson but this not documented. Date unknown. Lincoln, Ward Hill Lamon, and detectives traveled a secret route from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. to prevent an assassination attempt, called the Baltimore Plot. William Henry Johnson (March 4, 1833 ‚Äì January 28, 1864) was a free African American and the personal valet of Abraham Lincoln. Having first worked for Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, Johnson accompanied the President-Elect to Washington, D.C. for his first inauguration (1861). Once there, he was employed in various jobs, part-time as President's valet and barber, and later, following strife with others on the White House staff, as a messenger for the Treasury Department at $600 () per year. He traveled with Lincoln in November 1863 to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address. While traveling, Lincoln experienced symptoms of the onset of smallpox. At that time, an epidemic was spreading through Washington, D.C. and Lincoln's son Tad Lincoln had smallpox. Johnson tended to Lincoln and became quite ill by January 12, 1864, when he was admitted to a hospital. Johnson died within the next couple of weeks. Personal life Johnson's mother was an enslaved woman. He had a growing family while living in Washington, D.C. Dick Hart, past president of the Abraham Lincoln Association and historian who focuses on black history in Springfield, has been unsuccessful in finding any information about Johnson in Springfield. Lincoln guaranteed the mortgage on a house for Johnson. Career 1861 inauguration Abraham Lincoln employed Johnson as a valet and driver in Springfield, Illinois during the time of the 1860 United States presidential election. The Lincolns hosted an event for the Republican Presidential Nomination Notification Committee on May 19, 1860 at their house in Springfield, Illinois. Johnson announced people as they entered the house and directed them to the parlour to meet Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln. Either before or while working for Lincoln, he was also a bootblack and barber. Lincoln brought Johnson with him to the White House for his first inauguration. During the train trip, Johnson was observed by reporters to be attentive with untiring vigilance and acted as if he was an unofficial bodyguard. Lincoln said that Johnson was a worthy man of integrity and faithfulness. To evade an assassination attempt (called the Baltimore Plot), Lincoln left the train he was expected to arrive on in Washington. He boarded another train that took him from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Washington, transferring under cover of darkness in Baltimore. Lincoln's lawyer friend, Ward Hill Lamon, was the only person from Lincoln's Illinois entourage known to have traveled from Harrisburg through Baltimore to Washington with Lincoln to elude potential assassins of the Baltimore Plot, and there is no record that Johnson was present on this dangerous stretch of the journey. [Lamon, 42-7; Holzer, 392-6]. Johnson worked for Lincoln as a barber, valet, handyman, messenger, and bodyguard. The president said of him, \\"although not exactly the most prominent, [he] is yet the most useful member of the presidential party.\\" Lincoln trusted him to convey messages, and at times significant sums of money. The White House (also called the Executive Mansion) during the American Civil War He was shunned and treated miserably by other White House servants, because they were not welcoming of newcomers, did not want a change in the established pecking order among staff, and disliked that he was a particularly dark-skinned African-American. Until that point, all servants of the White House were light-skinned. It was clear within the first week that an employment change was needed for Johnson. Lincoln first wrote to the Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, but a suitable position was not found. In the meantime, Johnson continued his position, running errands some days that would take him out of the mansion for part or all of the day. At Lincoln's request, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase gave him a job in November or December, 1861, first as a laborer, and soon after as a messenger. [Roy P. Basler, ed., Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, V, 33]. If Lincoln needed Johnson's assistance for errands or tasks, he would send a message to his supervisor, Samuel Yorke At Lee, at the Treasury. Before working at the Treasury each workday morning, Johnson went to the White House and shaved and dressed Lincoln, which provided extra income. Lincoln with George B.

Besides both men having felt free to ask favors of one another, it is assumed that Johnson was treated equitably as any other man. Frederick Douglass, the black abolitionist, said of Lincoln, \\"He was the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely, who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color‚Ä¶\\" When he referred to him in letters, though, Lincoln called the 27 year-old Johnson a \\"colored boy.\\" [Basler, Collected Works, V, 33] In 1862, Johnson accompanied Lincoln to the Antietam Battlefield after the battle and the Confederate Army had left the area. He went with Lincoln on other trips. Smallpox There was a smallpox epidemic in Washington, D.C. during the winter of 1863-1864. On November 18, 1863, Johnson traveled by train with Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery where Lincoln would deliver the Gettysburg Address. On the train ride to Gettysburg, Lincoln looked \\"sallow, sunken-eyed, thin, [and] careworn\\". Lincoln's son,Tad Lincoln, had smallpox on the day that Lincoln left for Gettysburg, which prevented Mary Todd Lincoln from traveling with the President. During Lincoln's speech, he was described by newspaper reporters as \\"listless\\", \\"sweating\\", and \\"discouraged\\". On the return trip Lincoln went to bed in the Presidential train car with a bad headache. Johnson kept his forehead cool by bathing his forehead in cold water. Lincoln's illness was diagnosed as \\"Varioloid\\" which is a mild form of smallpox. Long thought to have been only a mild case, recent work suggests it was a serious illness.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", pages 411-431. He was bedridden and finally recovering on December 15. Johnson cared for Lincoln during his illness. Johnson contracted the disease and ultimately died in mid-January 1864. The President had him buried at his expense in Arlington National Cemetery. Lincoln paid off the mortgage on the Johnson family's house and sent money to his family. He paid off half of a loan that he had cosigned; the banker insisted on canceling the other half of the debt. Burial Section 27, Arlington National Cemetery Lincoln arranged for and paid for Johnson's burial in January 1864 and paid for his headstone. Contrary to a popular myth, though, Lincoln did not purchase the headstone that appears there now. Arlington ordered a new stone and inscribed on it Citizen, which was the label used to distinguish civilian graves from soldiers before Arlington became an exclusively military cemetery. According to Basler, he was buried in grave number 3346 in Section 27. Johnson was the first person to have been buried at Arlington, and one of 3,000 African-American \\"citizens\\" (rather than service members) who were buried there during the Civil War, due to the rate at which blacks escaped slavery and came to Washington. In popular culture William H. Johnson was a character in the 2012 film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, played by actor Anthony Mackie. In the film, Lincoln and Johnson are portrayed as childhood friends. In the film's opening scene, a young Lincoln rushes to the aid of a young Johnson, who is being whipped by a slaver. Johnson then goes on to work in the Lincoln White House and assist President Lincoln in his fight against the vampiric forces of the Confederate Army.

With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. By contrast, clients and servers in CORBA interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL). The restrictions imposed by HATEOAS decouple client and server. This enables server functionality to evolve independently.  Example  A REST client enters a REST application through a simple fixed URL. All future actions the client may take are discovered within resource representations returned from the server. The media types used for these representations, and the link relations they may contain, are standardized. The client transitions through application states by selecting from the links within a representation or by manipulating the representation in other ways afforded by its media type. In this way, RESTful interaction is driven by hypermedia, rather than out-of-band information. For example, this GET request fetches an account resource, requesting details in a JSON representation: GET /accounts/12345 HTTP/1.1 Host: bank.example.com Accept: application/vnd.acme.account+json ... The response is: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.acme.account+json Content-Length: ... { \\"account\\": { \\"account_number\\": 12345, \\"balance\\": { \\"currency\\": \\"usd\\", \\"value\\": 100.00 }, \\"links\\": { \\"deposit\\": \\"/accounts/12345/deposit\\", \\"withdraw\\": \\"/accounts/12345/withdraw\\", \\"transfer\\": \\"/accounts/12345/transfer\\", \\"close\\": \\"/accounts/12345/close\\" } } } The response contains these possible follow-up links: make a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer, or close the account. When the account information is retrieved later, the account is overdrawn: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.acme.account+json Content-Length: ... { \\"account\\": { \\"account_number\\": 12345, \\"balance\\": { \\"currency\\": \\"usd\\", \\"value\\": -25.00 }, \\"links\\": { \\"deposit\\": \\"/accounts/12345/deposit\\" } } } Now only one link is available: to deposit more money. In its current state, the other links are not available. Hence the term Engine of Application State. What actions are possible varies as the state of the resource varies. A client does not need to understand every media type and communication mechanism offered by the server. The ability to understand new media types can be acquired at run- time through \\"code-on-demand\\" provided to the client by the server.  Origins  The HATEOAS constraint is an essential part of the \\"uniform interface\\" feature of REST, as defined in Roy Fielding's doctoral dissertation. Fielding has further described the concept on his blog. The purpose of some of the strictness of this and other REST constraints, Fielding explains, is \\"software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency. Unfortunately, people are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design\\".

Reyes joined Black Flag after original vocalist Keith Morris had quit to form the Circle Jerks. Black Flag needed a singer to go on a tour to Vancouver, Canada, and asked Reyes to fill in. Ron is the singer on the \\"Jealous Again\\" EP, and is the vocalist in the film \\"The Decline of Western Civilization.\\" He left the band due to the violence at Black Flag shows. Thirty-three years after leaving Black Flag, Reyes reunited with the band in 2013 for an album, the band's first in twenty-eight years, and tour followed that same year with Reyes being fired mid-show during a performance in Australia. Ron started his band Piggy in 2011. And also was the guest lead vocalist for Whidbey Island Washington's POTBELLY on a split 7\\" with Montana's Bath Salts Brigade in 2018. He only did one performance with Potbelly.  Early life  Ron Reyes was born in Puerto Rico and spent the first years of his life in The Bronx before moving to the Redondo Beach/Torrance area of southern California. His father owned a popular jazz shop in California and Ron grew up listening to his father's record collection. As a boy, Ron would hang out in the streets and listen to Black Sabbath and David Bowie while his friends sniffed glue and smoked cannabis . He remembers himself as an outcast in school, where the jocks would make fun of his KISS inspired glam rock fashion. Despite scorn for his young ideas, an undeterred Ron carried his dreams to reality becoming an early adopter, first to do ‚Äì invent. And he shared his first experiences at legendary Hollywood punk venues like RAJI'S to his high school friends in Hermosa Beach, spreading the news and unfurling the flag for new local bands to come. Black Flag At the time of joining Black Flag, he was a street kid who had been following them since the beginning, and already knew all the songs. He also played drums in an early incarnation of Redd Kross, along with Greg Hetson, who went on to form the Circle Jerks with Keith Morris, and subsequently joined Bad Religion. After touring with the band for less than a year, he left Black Flag in the middle of a show at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach, due to his dissatisfaction with the rising violence in the punk scene. Reyes was coaxed back into Black Flag long enough to record the Jealous Again EP. He also appeared on some selections included on the 1983 compilation album Everything Went Black. He can be seen in Penelope Spheeris' 1980 documentary The Decline of Western Civilization, in which he dedicates the song \\"Revenge\\" to the LAPD, and jokingly shows off his apartment, which is a closet. After the recording sessions, Reyes went back to Vancouver and was replaced by singer Dez Cadena. The Jealous Again EP was released after Reyes had left the band for a final time. On the sleeve, he was credited as \\"Chavo Pederast,\\" nonstandard Spanish for \\"Kid Pedophile\\". After his departure from Black Flag, Reyes relocated to Vancouver and formed the band Crash Bang Crunch Pop!. Reyes rejoined Black Flag as vocalist for a 2013 tour and appeared on their subsequent album What The.... In November 2013, Reyes took to Facebook to inform fans that he was fired mid-show during a performance in Australia. Reyes said that his mic was taken and he was told to get off the stage by professional skateboarder and band manager Mike Vallely who also briefly fronted Black Flag in 2003. \\"You're done, party's over get off it's over...\\" He said something else to me but it was a lie so I won't repeat it here.\\" Reyes said differences with Greg Ginn made him relieved that he was no longer with the band saying \\"So with a sense of great relief that it was finally over I left the stage and walked to the hotel room. They finished the set with Mike V on vocals. Yes it is my opinion that we fell very short indeed and the diminishing ticket sales and crowds are a testament to that. However It was made clear to me that raising these issues was tantamount to a blasphemous stab in the back to Greg\\". In 2014, Reyes backed claims made by Greg Ginn's ex-wife that Ginn was abusive towards his 7 and 10 year old daughters and appeared in court on her behalf with Reyes claiming Ginn was on drugs around his daughters and would not properly feed them, often neglected them and that he is not capable of caring for children.  Recent activity  Reyes performed live in Vancouver in celebration of his 50th birthday in July 2010. Joining him on the bill were The Jolts, The Modernettes, Little Guitar Army, and The Braineaters featuring renowned artist Jim Cummins on lead vocals. Reyes' band consisted of guitarists Kevin Rose from Crash Bang Crunch Pop!, and Jon Doe from the Scramblers along with a rhythm section consisting of Real McKenzies founding member Anthony Walker on bass and Scott Beadle on drums. Greg Ginn performed three songs with the Ron Reyes Band at this event: \\"Jealous Again\\", \\"Revenge\\", and a new, original composition entitled \\"Broken\\". Reyes appeared in the Vancouver-based documentary Bloodied but Unbowed about Vancouver's punk community in the late 1970s and The Other F Word about being a parent involved in the punk community. The film also says Reyes has worked at a Vancouver print shop for more than 20 years and has three teenagers. He is shown browsing records at a used record store in Vancouver with one of his daughters, and purchasing a copy of Jealous Again. Reyes currently is performing as the guitarist for PIGGY. Other members of this new project include Izzy Gibson on lead vocals (currently drumming in The Hater Game, ex drummer of Living Deadbeats and AK-747s) Lisafurr Lloyd (ex Slickjacks; currently in the East Vamps) and on bass guitar; Craig McKimm (Little Guitar Army; The Fiends) on drums. In 2017, Reyes played bass with Vancouver rock n' roll icons Puzzlehead for one show only.

The majority of the belongings have a religious theme, while others are secular. It is a purposely built museum which during its planning met controversy over the exterior structure in a historic core, next to the parish church. Built in the middle of the 20th century, it was renovated in 2003, and now has three floors of exhibits. It is run by a committee and a group of volunteers and headed by the Archipriest of ≈ªabbar. The museum is open for three hours daily, from nine in the morning till noon, with a fee of two euro per person. Entrance fees and donations go for the upkeep of the museum and the preservation of the collection. History Ex-voto painting at the museum The museum was founded by Monsignor Joseph Zarb. After Zarb was appointed as Parish priest of ≈ªabbar, in 1943, he soon realized the opportunity the sanctuary of Our Lady of Graces gave in terms of authentic of historic artifacts. Being a researcher and a scholar, he listed all the belongings of the sanctuary ‚Äì among which are weapons, slave chains, model ships, church vestments, altar fronts and votive paintings ‚Äì which the Parish held. He later published the listed belongings in a book. In the past, some of the heritage of the parish was underestimated, prior to the opening of the museum, and the whereabouts of some former belongings is unknown. At one point, the parish held about 300 ex-voto, now down to about 85 on display at the museum. The artifacts were mostly offerings to the patron of the village, Our Lady of Graces, collected throughout the years from people of various backgrounds. Most ex-voto were donated by members of the Order of St. John and other labourers on the galleys, who were seamen. With the construction and opening of the museum, Zarb managed to house and preserve a large collection of artifacts, dating from pre-history, the Order of St. John, the French occupation of Malta, the British period, to 20th century Malta. Some 21st century items are also included. In the mid-20th century, the sanctuary received an official visit by Bishop Mikiel Gonzi when he crowned both the Madonna and Baby Jesus, which are depicted on a venerable 18th century work of Our Lady of Graces. Exhibits The museum's exhibits consist of donations made to the museum by individuals, artifacts and paintings that were formerly located in the sanctuary, and artifacts bought by auction. Selective exhibits at the museum include: Alcantara panels *85 ex-voto paintings, 74 of which are sea-related. This collection comprises the largest number of ex-votos in Malta that were given by the Knights of St. John; *two sedan chairs, one used by Grand Masters Rafael and Nicolas Cotoner, and the other by Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim who donated it to the sanctuary. He also donated two paintings, a Maltese clock exhibited in the museum and a full ceremonial knight's suit of armor decorated by aqua fortis technique; *a contemporary painting of the carrack Santa Anna, and a naval school model of the ship of the line San Gioacchino of 1767; *a medieval fresco of Our Lady of Graces found in St. Dominica's chapel in ≈ªabbar, and a collection of medals and coins; *a room dedicated to the 1975 ≈ªabbar Avro Vulcan crash and WWII artifacts; *mahogany wood panelling from the ship RMS Alcantara; *a larger than usual portable altar. *A plague hearse used during the 1813 outbreak.https://kliemustorja.com/k/ =Paintings= Painting of Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim at the museum Various works of art are exhibited in the museum, most of them with a religious theme as they were formerly in the sanctuary. The paintings include works by Rocco Buhagiar, Gio Nicola Buhagiar, Rafel Bonnici Cal√¨, Michele Busuttil, Tousaint Busuttil, Giuseppe Cal√¨, Giuseppe Maria Caruana, Giovanni Battista Conti, Giuseppe D'Arena, Stefano Erardi, Rafael Gagliardi, Tommaso Madiona, Mattia Preti, Italo Horatio Serge, Filippo Venuti and Francesco Zahra. Other paintings in the museum were donated by individuals. Two of them are the 1683 Battle of Vienna, and another depicting the port of Messina in the 18th century. Also there are bozzettos of paintings in the sanctuary. Building In 1952, plans were made to build a museum adjacent to the parish church to exhibit the artifacts. The post-war Baroque exterior design of the museum building faced some controversy from the planning authority, however the permit was subsequently approved. The first stone was laid on September 2, 1952. On September 5, 1954, the museum was officiated by Jackie Frendo Azzoppardi and blessed by Monsignor Emmanuel Galea. It is the second Parish museum, after the Cathedral Museum in Mdina, and the first purposely build museum in Malta. In 2003, the museum was reopened after being closed for renovation at the initiative of parish priest Anton Cassar. The belongings are now spread over the two floors of the building, and a platform at the first floor. =Administration= The museum is the responsibility of the Parish of ≈ªabbar. A commission of six volunteers, and the current Parish priest serving as president, direct its everyday operation, including the upkeep and restoration of the belongings. The museum's income derives from public donations. The museum is generally open daily, for three hours, between 9 am and noon.

Performances by the troupe follow a traditional Ten-in-One format featuring such acts as fire- eating, sword swallowing and a human blockhead, with show times lasting two and a half hours. Carnival Diablo opened on April Fools' Day 1992 by Scott McClelland, whose family goes back three generations in the carnival and side show business. Shows have been performed across Canada, including shows at The Calgary Stampede, Edmonton's Klondike Days (now K-Days,) Regina's Buffalo Days, and the Canadian Tulip Festival.\\"A good, old fashioned sword swallower\\" by Stephen Johnson, Ottawa XPress, May 7 2009. In 2008 and 2009, Carnival Diablo was featured act at Carniv√†le Lune Bleue,;\\"Carnival Diablo at Carnival Lune Bleue\\" at sideshowworld.com. a dedicated revival of a 1930s old-time carnival located in Ottawa, Ontario.  History  Scott McClelland's grandfather, Nicholas Paul Lewchuk, had run and operated Canada's largest travelling sideshow from 1920 through 1968. Starting as a performance show with acts ranging from sword swallowing to an on stage seance, Professor N.P. Lewchuck's Travelling Shows grew to include rides and live animals. Nicholas, whose fascination with magic led to the birth of the sideshow, performed many mental acts himself, with his wife Anastasia acting as the show sword swallower. Starting in 1968, Nicholas Lewchuk maintained the shows as a stationary attraction, until 1987. Starting early in life, Scott began apprenticing under his grandfather at the age of 13. Scott produced a Vaudeville Show called, Prof. Crookshank's Travelling Medicine Show in 1978 and performed it yearly at the Calgary Stampede, Edmonton's Klondike Days and Regina's Buffalo Days until 1985. He then toured the show to theatres until 1991. Scott was involved with two of Canada's largest haunted attractions. The first, 'The Caine Manor' built in 1981, was where Scott learned the ropes under horror special effects artist Charles Porlier. The second, 'The Black Castle', was a two story horror attraction that featured a thirty-minute journey from beginning to end. It was at this time that Scott began producing a Magic Torture Show featuring black magic illusions such as the Guillotine and a flaming Sword Cabinet. In keeping with the horror theme, these shows were performed by Scott in full zombie costume and makeup.\\"Nikolai Diablo blog\\" at bizarremagic.net. With the development of a working stage act, Scott invented Carnival Diablo as the Ultimate Sideshow, and began touring Canada in 1992. The act featured special effects combined with real feats and performances. Performers in Carnival Diablo's history have included Strongmen, Grindergirls, Human Pincushions, Sword Swallowers and Bug Eaters. The success of Carnival Diablo has led to appearances on television as well as a cameo appearance by Scott McClelland in the film Wolf Girl.

Their exhibits placed 3rd overall for \\"Best Attraction.\\" Scott also gave nightly lectures on the history of sideshow, as well as his experience as a showman.  Today  In recent years, Carnival Diablo has evolved from a stage show embodying the look and feel of a 19th-century Victorian sideshow to a performance tinged with more sinister and otherworldly subtext. Today, the Sideshow features various performers fulfilling the Ten-in-One act. Nikolai Diablo Leading the show, Scott McClelland eats razor blades, drinks boiling water, pierces his tongue with a hook and plays Russian Roulette with a nine- inch construction spike, among other amazing feats.

He was the fourth and youngest son of Saint Prince Alexander Nevsky‚Äîfamous in the history of the Russian State and the Russian Orthodox Church ‚Äî and his second wife, Princess Vassa. History of St. Daniel Monastery of Moscow One of the most junior princes in the House of Rurik, Daniel is thought to have been named after his celebrated relative, Daniel of Galicia. Government His father died when he was only two years old. Of his father's patrimonies, he received the least valuable, Moscow. When he was a child, the tiny principality was being governed by (deputies), appointed by his paternal uncle, Grand Prince Yaroslav III. Daniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, namely the Lord's Epiphany, and The Danilov Monestery (Saint Daniel Monestery): named in his honor, situated on the right bank of the Moskva River at a distance of 5 miles from the Moscow Kremlin, and founded, by Daniel, as the first monastery wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite no later than 1282.\\"Right-Believing Prince Daniel of Moscow\\", Orthodox Church in America He also built the first stone church in the Moscow Kremlin in the 1280s, dedicated to the Great Martyr Demetrius.\\"Holy, Glorious Demetrius the Myrrh- gusher of Thessalonica\\", Orthodox Church in America Daniel took part in his brothers'‚ÄîDmitri of Pereslavl and Andrey of Gorodets‚Äîstruggle for the right to govern Vladimir and Novgorod, respectively. After Dmitry's death in 1294, Daniel made an alliance with Mikhail of Tver and Ivan of Pereslavl against Andrey of Gorodets of Novgorod. Daniel's participation in the struggle for Novgorod in 1296 indicated Moscow's increasing political influence. Constantine, the prince of Ryazan, tried to capture the Moscow lands with the help of a Mongol force. Prince Daniel defeated it near Pereslavl. This was a first victory over the Tatars, though not a tremendous victory, but it was noteworthy as a first push towards freedom. In 1300, he went to Ryazan with an army and imprisoned the ruler of the Ryazan Principality \\"by some ruse\\", as the chronicle says, and destroyed a multitude of Tatars. To secure his release, the prisoner ceded to Daniel his fortress of Kolomna. It was an important acquisition, as now Daniel controlled all the length of the Moskva River. In 1302 his childless nephew and ally, Ivan of Pereslavl, bequeathed to Daniel all his lands, including Pereslavl-Zalessky. During the Mongol occupation and internecine wars among the Rus' princes, Daniel created peace in Moscow without bloodshed. During 30 years of ruling Daniel participated in battles only once. According to legend, Daniel was popular and respected by his subjects for his meekness, humility and peacefulness.  Death and canonization  At the age of 42 on the 5th of March in 1303 St. Daniel died. Before his death he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery. This was a common cemetery and by being buried there he was demonstrating humility. He was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1791 but only for local veneration. In the year 1330, the monastery was moved to Kremlin and the monastery was turned into a common parish. The cemetery became open to the public and his grave was lost. On August 30, 1652, many relics from Daniel of Moscow were found and were placed in a tomb in the Danilov Monastery in his honor. Marriage and children His wife was named Maria.

The Main Hall is constructed on a high and large platform, which is typical for wooden structures of the mid- to late-Ming Dynasty. The complex is one of the three major surviving Mazu temples in China and one of the oldest. The main function of the temple is to pray for safe navigation. The palace was a center of marine sacrifice in past dynasties and a venue for sailors to have happy get-togethers. Besides ceremonial rituals held to worship the Goddess of the Sea, performances are held to thank her.

Centred on North West England and led by George Booth, it took place during the political turmoil that followed the resignation of Richard Cromwell as head of The Protectorate. Intended as part of a national revolt organised by John Mordaunt, 1st Viscount Mordaunt, only the element led by Booth was initially successful; other local risings either failed to take place or were quickly suppressed. Booth seized the important city of Chester, while local commanders at Liverpool and Wrexham also joined, but found himself isolated. On 19 August, a government force under John Lambert defeated Booth at Winnington Bridge near Northwich, sometimes described as the final battle of the Civil War. Liverpool and Chester surrendered soon after; although Booth was captured and briefly imprisoned, he escaped punishment. The Commonwealth collapsed in 1660, leading to the Restoration of the monarchy, and Booth was rewarded with a peerage. Background Despite defeat in the First English Civil War, Charles I retained significant political power; this allowed him to create an alliance with Scots Covenanters and Parliamentarian moderates to restore him to the English throne. The moderates, who generally supported a constitutional monarchy, included many Presbyterians, who wanted to retain a state church; they were opposed in Parliament by a minority of religious Independents, who opposed any form of state church, and political radicals like the Levellers. Charles I at his trial, January 1649; many MPs strongly opposed his prosecution for treason. Although defeated in the 1648 Second English Civil War, Charles continued attempts to instigate another armed uprising. Elements of the New Model Army, including Oliver Cromwell and his supporters in Parliament, argued only his death could bring peace. Their proposal he be prosecuted for treason was opposed by the majority of MPs, many of whom were excluded by Pride's Purge in December 1648; even then, only 83 of the 210 members of the Rump Parliament voted in favour. After Charles was executed in January 1649, Royalist hopes centred on his son, the exiled Charles II of England. While the 1651 Third English Civil War failed to restore the monarchy, many Parliamentarians opposed the role of the military in government, and continuing instability led to Cromwell's appointment as Lord Protector in 1653. After his death in September 1658, he was succeeded by his son Richard; a significant element of the broad-based Third Protectorate Parliament supported the restoration of monarchy, and deep political divisions meant it was unable to provide stable government. In May 1659, the Army removed Richard Cromwell and re-seated the Rump Parliament; political uncertainty created a situation Royalist agents and the Stuart exiles hoped to exploit. Underlying these concerns was a growing fear that a \\"social and religious revolution was imminent\\". There was a widespread perception the Army and Rump Parliament were actively supporting religious radicals and undermining the gentry's traditional leading role in society. This was heightened when in mid 1659 the country's militia committees were put into the hands of those regarded as \\"persons of no degree or quality\\". =The Great Trust and Commission= The impetus for the 1659 rising was provided by John Mordaunt, younger brother of the 2nd Earl of Peterborough. Mordaunt led a Royalist faction that had become frustrated with the caution, viewed by them as \\"cowardice\\", of the aristocratic members of the Sealed Knot. While the Sealed Knot took the position that the Commonwealth regime would likely disintegrate in time, Mordaunt's \\"Action Party\\" argued that an uprising would provoke its collapse. On 1 March 1659 Charles issued a number of commissions to instigate a new rising to a group known as the \\"Great Trust and Commission\\". The initiative was partly due to Charles's chief advisor Clarendon, who wanted to ensure the exiled court retained control of political opposition to the Commonwealth. Mordaunt was given a central role and while its other members were initially from the Sealed Knot, tensions between them and Mordaunt meant that they became a minority in the group as Mordaunt continued recruiting. The outline strategy was based on one put forward in 1658 by Roger Whitley. Whitley recognised that there was no guarantee when, or where, external help from the exiles would arrive and suggested a decentralised series of local risings would be most flexible. Whitley's plan was dependent on uniting disarmed and impoverished ex-Royalists with disaffected Presbyterians, advocating that Charles encourage the latter by promising \\"to settle all differences in Religion\\". Mordaunt was unable to secure commitment from Major-General Browne in London, but focused efforts on strategic ports at Bristol and Lynn, with other major risings at Shrewsbury, Warwick and Worcester, while a series of diversionary actions were planned elsewhere, including one in Cheshire. By July 1659 Mordaunt felt there was a good chance of success with \\"confusion now so great [...] dayly and hourely considerable people turn to the King\\". Mordaunt's agents claimed the support both of influential moderate Presbyterians such as Alexander Popham in Wiltshire, as well as long-term Stuart loyalists such as Marmaduke Langdale. While the degree of support was likely exaggerated by Mordaunt, the exiled court also became involved; in July the Duke of York wrote to the North Wales Royalist Sir John Owen stating that \\"the time draws near for action\\". Fearing that any further delays would result in the plans being discovered by the government, Mordaunt issued an order for a general rising on 1 August. =The conspiracy in Cheshire and Lancashire= Lely thought to be of Sir George Booth. Mordaunt initially discounted a Cheshire rising due to the lack of credible Royalist leaders in the area. A potential alternative was provided by Sir George Booth, who fought for Parliament throughout the First Civil War, and was elected MP for Cheshire in 1646. Part of the Presbyterian faction that dominated the Long Parliament and many of the pre-war county elites, Booth was excluded in December 1648, then re-elected in 1652 and retained his seat throughout the Protectorate. However, he was barred from Parliament on suspicion of involvement in the 1655 Penruddock uprising, while he referred to the Major-Generals as \\"Cromwell's hangmen\\". This record of opposition to the regime, social position and wealth combined to make him an attractive figure to the \\"Great Trust\\". After meeting Mordaunt several times in London, he joined the conspiracy and returned to Cheshire in May; by July, he had secured a number of promises of local backing. Although not generally considered a disaffected area, circumstances combined to make Cheshire a suitable recruiting ground. During the First Civil War, Booth's main opponent as leader of the local Parliamentary cause was Sir William Brereton; in 1646, he was 'one of the most powerful and influential men in England', but he retired to London, leaving a power vacuum. Other factors were the continuing erosion of the gentry's status under the Commonwealth, and the deeply unpopular Charles Worsley, one of the Major-Generals who governed the area from 1655 until his death in 1656. These issues were mirrored in the adjacent county of Lancashire. Local Presbyterians continued to pray for Charles II after doing so was banned in 1650, but remained loyal in 1651, largely because of the strength of local Catholicism and its association with Royalism. However, in July 1659 Parliament passed a new Militia Act further reducing the power of the old elite, while it was falsely claimed local 'religious schismatics', or Quakers, were preparing a revolt. Many viewed the combination as confirmation of social revolution, including Henry Newcome, Presbyterian minister of Manchester Collegiate church, who was a prominent supporter of the rising. The national insurgency  Edward Massey, former Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester; Mordaunt's instructions to him were intercepted on 28th July Despite the ongoing political instability, the government intelligence service continued to function and was aware of a planned revolt. As early as 9th July, orders were issued to local militias, while the Navy blockaded Ostend, the port through which Charles was most likely to sail for England. On 28th July, the authorities received confirmation of the plan when they intercepted letters from Mordaunt to Edward Massey with final instructions for the rising at Gloucester. While not necessarily a setback nationally, realisation the government had been alerted probably discouraged many from joining on 1 August, as did a \\"dismal letter of foreboding\\" from the Sealed Knot received by local conspirators on 31 July. Local risings began as ordered on 1 August, but it soon became clear numbers were far below those expected. Several rendezvous points were already patrolled by the county militia; 120 horsemen assembled in Sherwood Forest under Richard Byron and Charles White of Newthorpe, intending to take Newark, but were pursued and dispersed. In Shropshire, Charles Lyttelton was to mount a surprise attack on Shrewsbury, but only 50 men joined him: they marched as far as the Wrekin before dispersing. Mordaunt, who escaped arrest on 28 July, gathered around 30 men on Banstead Downs in Surrey, but fled when it became clear the insurgency was failing. Charles White and others from the Nottinghamshire group reached Derby, where they declared for Charles and briefly tried to raise additional forces, but here as elsewhere the rebels were quickly suppressed. Booth's Uprising In Cheshire, Booth seems to have considered cancelling the rising, but as 31 July was a Sunday, many Presbyterian clergy had called on their congregations to join him. This meant men were already being assembled and arms gathered, giving the leaders little choice but to continue; Booth mustered several hundred supporters at Warrington on 1 August. The senior government officer in Lancashire was Colonel Thomas Birch, Booth's colleague during the First English Civil War. He was advised of the letters intercepted on 28 July, but made little effort to stop the rising; Birch was instrumental in the appointment of Newcome to the Manchester Collegiate Church in 1656, and his sympathies may have been divided. Booth advanced towards Chester and on the 2nd held a new rendezvous at Rowton Heath, where he issued a \\"Declaration\\" and a second manifesto titled \\"A Letter to a Friend\\". This omitted any mention of Charles, stating only that the rebels wanted the readmission of excluded members of the Long Parliament, or elections to a new Parliament. Since he was assured of Royalist support, Booth focused on appealing to fellow Presbyterians, combined with attacks on the Rump's corruption, and a promise to the \\"undeceived part of the Army\\" to increase their pay. This approach was relatively successful; unlike other parts of the country, he gained the support of \\"almost all the local gentry and nobility\\", including former Royalists. On 3 August sympathisers in Chester allowed Booth into the city; as more recruits came in, his force grew to around 3,000. The governor, Captain Thomas Croxton, and his militia took refuge in Chester Castle; without siege artillery Booth was unable to dislodge them, and after leaving 700 men to blockade the castle, he marched on Manchester with the majority of the rebels. He was joined at Bidston by the Earl of Derby, head of a prominent Royalist family, as well as Gilbert Ireland, MP for Liverpool and another political moderate. A second contingent under Randolph Egerton left Chester and crossed the Welsh border to Chirk Castle, home of former Parliamentarian commander Sir Thomas Myddelton. Myddelton joined Egerton and led the rebels from Chirk to Wrexham, the area's principal town, drawing in other local sympathisers. Unlike Booth, many of his followers were Royalists, and in contrast to the cautious \\"Declaration\\", Myddelton openly proclaimed Charles as King on 7 August. =Government response= Parliament responded quickly to news of the rising, appointing Major-General John Lambert to suppress it. Two regiments of foot left London on 5 August; Lambert followed the next day with the cavalry and made rapid progress, despite heavy rain and initial near-mutiny among his men due to lack of pay. A brigade of 1,500 foot and horse under Colonels Axtell and Sankey were recalled from Ireland; they arrived at the North Wales port of Beaumaris, although one transport with 30 cavalry sank en route. Learning of Lambert's approach, Booth appeared uncertain on how to respond, but first attempted to appeal to his soldiers directly by issuing a new communication, the \\"Express\\". Faced with the choice of confronting Lambert's veterans, returning to Chester to await the arrival of Charles and his exiles, or retreating towards North Wales, Booth resorted to \\"wandering about in mid- Cheshire to the dismay of his fellow leaders\\". Lambert responded to an attempt to open negotiations by demanding he surrender; when a second approach was made by a group of Presbyterian ministers, it simply confirmed his opponents wanted to avoid fighting. =Winnington Bridge= The foot regiments from London mustered with the cavalry at Market Drayton on 14 August. Lambert reached Nantwich on 15th, while Booth fell back on Chester; the same day two warships blockaded the mouth of the River Dee, preventing aid reaching the rebels by sea. Lambert advanced rapidly towards Northwich and on 18 August, he almost caught Booth's forces by surprise; they were saved only by a rapid withdrawal ordered by Roger Whitley. Lambert's scouts made contact with Booth's rearguard in the Delamere Forest, before camping for the night at Weaverham. Early on 19 August, most of Booth's force was drawn up in battle order on high, broken ground near Hartford north and west of the River Weaver. Although the ground was unsuitable for cavalry, Lambert nevertheless attacked, driving their outposts back to Winnington Bridge, where they attempted a stand, before retreating after a \\"fierce but brief\\" battle. The rebel cavalry was quickly routed, while their infantry escaped into some nearby enclosures. The government army made no effort to pursue them and losses were minimal on both sides; Lambert reported 30 rebels killed at Winnington Bridge, the only notable casualty being Captain Edward Morgan of Golden Grove, Flintshire, killed covering their retreat. =End of the uprising= Chirk Castle, in 1725; the final rebel outpost to surrender, at the end of August. Most of the gentry leaders fled, and then surrendered, following the battle. Chester surrendered to Lambert on 21 August, followed by Liverpool shortly afterwards; the rest of Cheshire and Lancashire were back in government hands within a week. The last to submit were the remaining North Wales insurgents under Myddelton's eldest son Thomas, who withdrew into Chirk Castle; they eventually surrendered to Sankey's \\"Irish Brigade\\" at the end of the month. Booth fled south after Winnington Bridge, travelling in a carriage and disguising himself in women's clothes as \\"Lady Dorothy\\". He was eventually arrested at Newport Pagnell after a suspicious innkeeper noted his 'female' guest asking for a barber and a razor: by the end of August he was in custody in London. Mordaunt himself evaded efforts to locate him and escaped the country in September. Despite news of the failures outside Cheshire, Charles travelled to St. Malo in order to join Booth, but learned of his defeat shortly before sailing. Aftermath While nearly all the leadership in the Cheshire rising, with the exception of Whitley, were captured, the political background meant that they went largely unpunished. Most low-status prisoners were quickly released and none of those of higher social rank, including Booth, were brought to trial or lost their estates. Mordaunt was undeterred by the failure of the rising, but his plans were rendered irrelevant by the actions of General George Monck in late 1659‚Äì60, which were to lead to the readmission of the excluded Presbyterian members of Parliament on 21 February 1660, and ultimately to the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II. Booth was freed in time to travel to Breda as a Parliamentary commissioner to negotiate Charles's return. While Booth was created 1st Baron Delamer by Charles, the failure of their uprising only a few months prior to the Restoration meant that he and many other Cheshire insurgents saw relatively little reward for their efforts. This disappointment, along with local distaste for Charles's religious policies after 1661, meant that the lasting legacy of Booth's Uprising was perhaps the creation of the nucleus of an anti-court \\"Country\\" party based in the region. Booth's son Henry became a committed Whig, and ultimately was heavily involved in the 1688 Glorious Revolution that removed the Stuarts from the throne.

Risalamande was created in the late 19th century. It is made out of rice pudding mixed with whipped cream, vanilla, and chopped almonds; and is usually served cold with a warm cherry sauce (kirseb√¶rsovs). It gained popularity when rice pudding became more common. Until then rice pudding had been a very exclusive dish, as making it required two expensive, imported ingredients: rice and cinnamon. After World War II, risalamande experienced an increase in popularity, being touted as a \\"savings\\" dessert: adding whipped cream (which was easily available) to the still fairly expensive rice would make the rice last longer. In order to minimize costs, risalamande was frequently made without almonds during this time, too. A similar traditional Danish Christmas dish, risengr√∏d, is essentially risalamande before the whipped cream, vanilla, and almonds have been added, and is typically served hot, topped with cinnamon and butter. Nowadays, it is very common to make a large batch of rice pudding for dinner on lillejuleaften (\\"Little Christmas Eve\\", i.e. December 23), a part of which is kept until Christmas Eve and used to make risalamande, which is eaten as dessert after the big Christmas dinner. Normally, a whole almond is added to the dessert, and the person who finds it wins a small prize‚Äîsuch as a chocolate heart, a marzipan pig, or a small board game.Danish Christmas Traditions .

Typically it is made of chilled leftover rice pudding, whipped cream, sugar and vanilla, with or without almonds. By tradition, the person finding a hidden almond in the dessert is expected to get married before the next Christmas. A variety containing diced oranges is called apelsinris. The dish is mostly served with either a smooth cordial, jam or semi-thawed frozen berries. A commercially sold snack, similar to Ris √† la Malta, is sold under the name \\"Risifrutti\\" since 1993. Norwegians have a similar dish called riskrem (‚Äúrice cream‚Äù) and, as in Denmark, the person finding a hidden almond in the dessert wins a mandelgave (almond present) in the form of a marzipan pig or the like. The dessert may contain almonds for flavour, but mostly chopped on top as decoration. In Norway, the sauce is also normally made of raspberry (or even strawberry) rather than cherry.

It records dedications made in the temple to Athena at Lindos prior to the destruction of the original temple in 392/1. The chronicle is one of the longest surviving Hellenistic inscriptions. It was excavated early in the 20th century by a Danish expedition, which found it used as paving block of the Byzantine church of Saint Stephen, near the theatre of Lindos. It contains decrees of Lindians, as well report on previous dedications of rulers and generals to Athena Lindia. The chronicle is inscribed on a marble slab, approximately eight-by-three feet, which is now broken into two pieces. The catalogue of dedications contains about forty-five entries, though only thirty-seven are still legible. Additionally, the chronicle contains four miracle stories about Athena, of which only one is still totally legible, and two more are fragmentary. The chronicle was first edited and published in 1912 by Christian Blinkenberg. Carolyn Higbie published the first English translation in 2003.

The Karalundi College is an affiliated school of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.  History  Karalundi was established in 1954 as an Aboriginal boarding school run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Western Australia. It was begun after its founder Pastor Dudley Vaughan was challenged to begin such a work by Avy Curley OAM.An Extraordinary Woman. Signs of the Times. Retrieved 8 June 2011 The property was north of Meekatharra. The school served the Murchison, Upper Gascoyne, Pilbara and Western Desert regions. Classes began in September 1954, with a focus on literacy, numeracy and practical skills. During its early years of operation, Karalundi was rated by the Western Australian Department of Education as a \\"most efficient establishment\\" and commended for the \\"relatively high standard of attainment\\" by students. Karalundi was closed in September 1974 in a government move to phase out church involvement in indigenous affairs. The property was sold into private hands and operated as a farm-stay enterprise for 12 years. In the early 1980s, many past students came to recognise that under the state system, their children's education was inferior to their own. These parents lobbied the state government for Karalundi to reopen as an independent parent-controlled Christian Aboriginal boarding school, where children would be educated away from the problems associated with alcohol abuse and gain an education focusing on practical life skills, as well as literacy and numeracy. The advocacy group was supported by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and, in August 1986, Karalundi was reopened as such. The school has been the location of published studies of a peer support program and a health promotion program in 1998. Karalundi has recently extended its secondary program to include Years 11 and 12 and is recognised as one of the leading schools in Aboriginal education in Western Australia.  Student life  All students at the school are boarders. Students are housed in dormitories. Students are resident only during the school term and return to their communities for holiday periods.Karalundi Aboriginal Education Centre Profile . Aboriginal Independent Community School. Retrieved 2009-07-24 Due to the boarding nature of Karalundi, all staff are encouraged to participate in the overall program of the school, both within and outside school hours. This entails being involved with the students in the social and spiritual life of Karalundi.  Management  Karalundi is an independent parent controlled school, incorporated in 1986. An Executive Committee of 15 members (elected at an Annual General Meeting) is responsible for the governance and long term planning of Karalundi. Day-to-day management is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, Principal and Finance Controller who make up the Administrative Committee and are responsible for hiring of staff and faculty and implementing the strategic plan. The parents who operate the school are largely former Karalundi students. They are Seventh-day Adventists, and require that Karalundi be operated with the ethos of the Seventh-day Adventist faith. All staff are required to exhibit exemplary Christian standards before the students, and uphold the Christian ethos. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input.

History A post mill was standing at Gayton () in 1797 when it was marked of Faden's map of Norfolk. The mill was advertised for sale in 1815 and 1819. The tower mill had been built by 1824, when it was marked on the first edition Ordnance Survey map of Norfolk. Robert Matthews was the miller in 1836. In 1872, the mill was offered to let. By then a steam mill powered by a Clayton & Shuttleworth steam engine was working an additional three pairs of French Burr millstones. The mills were taken by Edward Lewis, who had previously been at a watermill at West Acre. The mill was sold by auction on 23 September 1873 at the Globe Hotel, King's Lynn. It was bought by Edward Lewis. The mills remained in the Lewis family, and a limited company, Gayton Mills Co Ltd, was formed in 1919. The mill had ceased working by wind at this time, power being provided by a Blackstone paraffin engine. The engine was later replaced by a diesel engine. The sails were removed c1925. The mills were worked by engine until 1937. The mill retained its cap and fanstage in 1933 but had become derelict by 1949. The cap and top storey of the mill had been removed by the time the mill buildings were advertised for sale by auction in King's Lynn on 29 July 1980. They were withdrawn from the auction and later sold privately. The new owners converted the mill to a residential craft centre. They also planned to restore the cap and sails of the mill. In 1987, planning permission was granted to use the mill as seasonal holiday accommodation. It is now, (2011, I don\`t know when its use changed) however used as accommodation for people who unfortunately have mental health problems. Description Gayton Mill was an eight storey tower mill with a stage at the third floor. The tower is inside diameter at base level, with walls thick. It had an ogee cap, and was winded by a six bladed fantail. It had four Patent sails and drove three pairs of overdrift millstones. The surviving stone nut is of cast iron with wooden teeth. The upright shaft is partly wooden and partly cast iron. The great spur wheel is cast iron, it has a cast iron crown wheel underneath. The tower has been truncated by one storey and the top is crenellated.

Lydia was created by series producer Bryan Kirkwood as one of many characters introduced that year. She made her debut in the soap on 4 March 2009, and remained for ten months. Lydia's storylines focus on homosexuality, obsessiveness and murder. The seemingly level-headed music lover and friend of Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood), she is portrayed as opinionated, passionate young student who had a love of music and protecting her family, for example her young sister Persephone Hart (Elizabeth Hadley) who also appeared in the show for a period of three months. Lydia's relationship to the sexually confused Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) was central to the character for seven months of the year culminating with her screen death in October 2009 after she was murdered by Lydia. Other storylines included her ongoing on-off relationship with ex-girlfriend Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) and continued feuds with Archie (Stephen Beard) and Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister). The characters departure was announced in December 2009, when the character was arrested for the attempted murder of Zoe at Sarah's graveside after stabbing her, resulting in her being charged for the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe, with Lydia making her final appearance on 1 January 2010. The parachute stunt won a British Soap Award in 2010. The aftermath storyline has received mixed reviews from critics. Some have favoured Lydia's \\"bunny boiling\\" and others described it as a \\"drawn out and boring storyline.\\" Character creation and casting In November 2008, during an episode of Hollyoaks spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister) had a sexual encounter. Up to now both characters had previously been portrayed as heterosexual and this was the start of Sarah's on-going sexuality crisis. The character of Lydia Hart was created as the new love interest for the sexually confused already established character, Sarah. When the character first appeared on-screen she was revealed to have a younger sister, Persephone Hart (Elizabeth Hadley), who was attending the dance classes taught by Sarah. Little is known about the rest of Lydia's family, although the character did stay with her mother frequently off-screen. The character was also given links to Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) who arrived in Hollyoaks in June 2009. It was soon revealed that Lydia was Charlotte's ex-girlfriend. It was announced in February 2009 that Hollyoaks series producer Bryan Kirkwood had cast television newcomer Lydia Kelly in the role of Lydia. Speaking to the Hollyoaks website of her casting, Kelly stated, \\"It was brilliant, when my agent said I'd got the part I didn't believe her.\\" and in Hollyoaks Backstage, Kelly was asked what was next for Lydia, she stated, \\"[...] I don't know whats next for Lydia [...] I think justice has to be done soon.\\" In December 2009, it was announced that Kelly would leave the show. Producers confirmed that Lydia would depart at the climax of her storyline. Character development=Characterisation= Lydia first arriving on-screen was first shown as different from other characters and it was stated from her inception that she was passionate about music and enjoyed getting people into the music scene. Speaking of her character, Kelly stated \\"She's very down to earth. She knows exactly what she wants, where she wants to go, and how to get there! She's also very level-headed.\\" From the characters inception, she was shown to be an opinionated, proud young student who wasn't afraid of her homosexuality and a person who could make friends very easily, as well as enemies. Lydia's relationships helped develop the character. Her first relationship off-screen is with ex-girlfriend Charlotte, who supposedly shared her interests in music and fashion, as they were both considered 'out there'. The history of the relationship immediately gave viewers an insight to the character. However, their relationship was seemingly shattered by Lydia's constant jealousy and her clingy nature, which ultimately lead to their break up. But, Lydia tried to commit suicide soon after, which was told on-screen when Charlotte arrived in the village. Lydia's second relationship is a more serious one, with the sexually confused Sarah Barnes; Sarah, who had previously been portrayed as heterosexual, suffers an identity crisis, coming to terms with her one-night stand with Zoe Carpenter, however Sarah ended the relationship after Lydia became interfering and tried to control her life due to falling in love with her. Speaking to entertainment website Digital Spy about Sarah's relationship with Lydia, Loui Batley commented, \\"With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked.\\" After her relationship with Sarah ended, the character's true persona was revealed. She became jealous of Sarah and her relationship with Zoe, and the character's vulnerability became the centre of her deranged campaign for revenge in the latter part of 2009, as she was excluded from Sarah's life. =Murder and exit= Lydia sabotages Zoe's parachute in Hollyoaks Later (2009). In July 2009, it was announced by Hollyoaks that Loui Batley had quit her role as Sarah and Zoe Lister (Zoe) would depart the soap later in the year and that one of the girls' exits, however, will result in a \\"tragic curtain call\\". It was announced that Lydia would be the cause of the pair's departure. In later September, Lydia became very jealous of Sarah, who she had recently split up with. She also became jealous of Zoe, who Sarah had a one-night stand with in the previous year. During the events of Hollyoaks Later in October, Lydia's jealousy went out of control when she sabotaged a parachute, which was revealed to be used by either Sarah or Zoe. It was announced that one of the pair would be killed after plummeting to their death. Hysterical Lydia, who thought Sarah and Zoe were having an affair, had a conversation with Charlotte and revealed when they split up, she attempted suicide, proving the character's vulnerability. After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry that she might have got the sabotaged parachute. While doing the jump, Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she hits the ground, Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again. After Zoe is released from prison and is found not guilty of Sarah's murder, it is believed that Sarah committed suicide after her diary, found by Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) is used as evidence in court. Soon Lydia starts to befriend Zoe and she ends up moving in with the Barnes family where Lydia now lives and soon Zoe plans too uncover Lydia's murderous ways as she does not want to be known as a killer. In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, Lister said of the storyline, \\"It all gets really messy from here! Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts thinking that because she loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, if she gets with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out.\\" She explained: \\"Lydia starts becoming obsessed with Zoe and to keep control, Zoe has to go with it. There's a point where Lydia kisses her! And then Mike walks in and kicks Zoe out.\\" The culmination of the plot saw Lydia lure Zoe to a church and stab her at Sarah's grave. The stabbing storyline was described as a \\"brutal attack\\" and at the time producers refused to reveal if Zoe would die. Describing the terror Lydia causes a spokesperson for the serial stated: \\"Zoe can‚Äôt believe it when Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That‚Äôs when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her.\\" This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge). They both fight to grab the knife while an unconscious Zoe bleeds, ultimately leading to the arrest of Lydia when the police arrive. She is later charged with the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe. Storylines=2009‚Äì2010= Lydia first appears in March 2009 as a friend of Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood). She orders Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) to fire Sarah after her sister Persephone Hart tells her that Sarah hit her.

Sarah then shows more of an interest in Lydia. Lydia finds out Sarah is bribing Holly Cunningham (Lydia Waters) to befriend Persephone so she could get closer to her, leaving things awkward between the girls. The next day, Lydia allays her fears to Sarah over relationships and the girls seal it with a kiss, which Michaela sees. Sarah and Lydia then begin a full relationship. It is revealed that out of her family, Persephone is the only one who knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him out because he was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup. Lydia is later kicked out of the band due to unreliability. After breaking up from Sarah, Lydia becomes jealous of Zoe and Sarah's friendship. Lydia then begins going out with Sarah again although she is more invested in the relationship with Sarah. Lydia's true colours start to show when she tells Sarah she has received dead flowers on her and former girlfriend Charlotte's anniversary, she tells Sarah she thinks they are from Charlotte, she then shows the same bouquet to Charlotte and accuses Zoe. It is then revealed during an argument with Charlotte that Lydia tried to kill herself when she and Charlotte split up. Lydia sees Sarah and Zoe going on an adventure holiday with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and is jealous when she takes Zoe. Lydia follows them and has an argument with Sarah. She continues to pretend Charlotte is stalking her in order to gain sympathy. When left alone with Zoe, she tells her Sarah tried to kill herself over her. Later, Lydia overhears Sarah admit her love to a drunken Zoe. The next day, Lydia begins slitting her wrists and tries to convince Sarah that Zoe is trying to split them up. Lydia uses a knife on one of the parachutes which Zoe will use, however they get mixed up. As the girls head into the sky, Lydia begins to feel guilty and tries to stop them, however Zoe and Sarah jump out. Lydia follows and is horrified when Zoe's parachute deploys and Sarah's does not. Sarah then hits the ground. Lydia and Zoe rush to her body, both crying. Lydia frames Zoe for the death of Sarah by hiding the knife used to sabotage the parachute behind Zoe's bed. Lydia then proceeds to slit her wrists in the shower due to her guilt.Lydia stabs Zoe at Sarah's grave (2009). As Lydia recovers in hospital, Zoe is charged with Sarah's murder. Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt. Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) confronts Lydia over the day of Sarah's death and is shocked when Lydia claims she was not supposed to die. Archie goes to the police, however they do not do anything. During Sarah's funeral, Archie arrives at her wake and announces Lydia caused her death. When no one believes him, he is removed. Before Zoe's court case, Mike goes to visit her. Lydia tries to tell Mike that she will try to appear innocent. When he returns, and claims he knows she could not have killed Sarah, Lydia manipulates him into believing that she was just trying to get him on side. At this time, Charlotte and Lydia get back together. At the court case, Lydia lies whilst giving a statement. Charlotte accompanies Lydia to the case, agreeing to keep their new relationship quiet. However, when she sees the knife used to cut the parachute, Charlotte realises Lydia was responsible for Sarah's death. After she confesses, Lydia tells Charlotte if she goes to prison, she will kill herself. Zoe is found not guilty of Sarah's murder, due to the court believing Sarah committed suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her what she saw, and tells her she believes Zoe is trying to get Mike on her side to make it look like she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she could try to get Zoe on her side, she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out of the flat. On New Year's Eve, Lydia discovers Zoe's true reasons for befriending her and decides to murder her at Sarah's grave, before taking her own life. Zoe and Lydia meet in a church to admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. However, Zoe flees and is knocked unconscious. When she wakes up, she finally gets a confession from Lydia, who admits why she cut the parachute. Zoe attacks Lydia before leaving. At Sarah's grave, Lydia stabs Zoe, as Charlotte, Mike and Dave arrive to stop her. As Zoe is taken away in an ambulance, Lydia is arrested. Lydia is questioned by D.I. Fletcher (Laura Fletcher) as Zoe recovers in hospital. Lydia admits everything and she is then charged for the murder of Sarah and attempted murder of Zoe. She is later given a lifetime prison sentence. Reception Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture criticised Lydia, during her monthly review on the popularity of soap opera characters; she branded her as an unconvincing villain, stating: ‚ÄòLooking like a demented shrew doesn't mean you're convincing at being a crazed murderess. The whole 'who killed Sarah' storyline is rather silly, and it's not helped by Lydia being a rubbish villain. Memo to Hollyoaks: must try harder.‚Äô The parachute stunt won ‚ÄòSpectacular Scene Of The Year‚Äô at the 2010 British Soap Awards. Olly Richards, writing for men's lifestyle magazine FHM, commented on the aftermath of Sarah's death and Lydia's storyline by branding it as a ‚Äòreally drawn out and really boring plotline.‚Äô Radio Times included Lydia on their list of top bunny-boilers, due to her attitude towards Sarah and killing her out of jealousy. They ironically joked about how long she could repress her murderous impulses, giving her until the new year (the actual time until she tried to kill Zoe). Daily Star also commented on the storyline with Zoe, stating ‚Äòsmitten Lydia falls for her act, and is delighted as she always thought Zoe was out of her league.‚Äô ReferencesExternal links * Character profile on the E4 website * Character profile on the Hollyoaks Later website Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2009 Fictional lesbians Female villains Fictional murderers Fictional LGBT characters in television Fictional prisoners and detainees Female characters in television LGBT villains ","title":"Lydia Hart"},{"id":"23738980","text":"Gayton Windmill may refer to a number of windmills in the United Kingdom. *Gayton Windmill, a post mill which stood at *Gayton Windmill, a tower mill which stands at *Gayton Windmill , a tower mill in present-day Merseyside  See also  *Gayton (disambiguation) ","title":"Gayton Windmill"},{"id":"23738986","text":"Thomas Nicoll (born 1 July 1798 at Hendon, Middlesex; died 15 January 1883 at Shenley, Hertfordshire) was an English amateur cricketer who played first- class cricket from 1817 to 1835.

It is part of a group of three islands that make up the Nusa Penida district, of which it is the most famous. This island group in turn is part of the Lesser Sunda Islands.  Administration  Administratively, the island is part of a subdistrict of Klungkung regency. Nusa Lembongan is one of three small offshore islands which make up a sub-regency of Klungkung, the others being: Nusa Penida and Nusa Ceningan.Government Office of the Regency of Klungkung Nusa Lembongan has the vast majority of the tourist infrastructure within the sub-regency and is a popular side destination for visitors to mainland Bali and Lombok .  Geography  Nusa Lembongan Reef, Bali, Indonesia Map showing the location of the suspension bridge, connecting Lembongan with a nearby island (bottom center); the bridge collapsed on October 16, 2016 Typical limestone cliff-line of south-west Nusa Lembongan Jungut Batu village in Nusa Lembongan Nusa Lembongan is approximately 8 square kilometres in area with a permanent population estimated at 5,000. Twelve kilometres of the Badung Strait separates Nusa Lembongan from Bali Island. The island is surrounded by coral reefs with white sand beaches and low limestone cliffs. Nusa Lembongan is separated from Nusa Ceningan by a shallow estuarine channel which is difficult to navigate at low tide. There are no permanent waterways on Nusa Lembongan. There is a suspension bridge linking Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan which takes foot and motorbike traffic only. There are three main villages on the island. Jungut Batu and Mushroom Bay are the centres of the tourist-based industry and activities on the island whilst much of the permanent local population resides in Lembongan Village. To the east, the Lombok Strait separates the three islands from Lombok, and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes. The north-eastern side of the island is flanked by a relatively large area of mangroves totalling some 212 hectares. Nusa Lembongan is served by regular direct speed-boat services, mostly from the east-coast Bali resort town of Sanur. Crossing time is approximately 30 minutes and services run at regular intervals during daylight hours. Larger cargo boats also run daily from the Bali port town of Padang Bai. The island is populated by very few cars. For its main source of transportation is by scooters and foot, due to the small size of the island.  Local economy  Seaweed farming at Nusa Lembongan The economy is largely based on tourism and Nusa Lembongan is the only one of the three neighbouring islands to have any significant tourism-based infrastructure. There is also subsistence agriculture and fishing on the island and used to be a seaweed farming micro-industry, until as recently as 2015, when due to tourism and pollution it became unviable. The island also contains a number of guesthouses and even a small gym. Oceanic sunfish in the waters off Nusa Lembongan.  Conservation issues  Marine conservation is considered extremely important to sustaining future levels of tourism on the island and in February 2009, a local NGO from Nusa Lembongan, facilitated by The Nature Conservancy Coral Triangle Center, opened a community centre on Nusa Lembongan. The waters around Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida have at least 247 species of coral and 562 species of reef fish. Other conservation initiatives include a release programme of critically endangered olive ridley turtles from Sunset Beach on the south western coast.

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition. This \\"leaf-on\\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in the FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. In 2009, most NAIP imagery will be acquired with digital sensors rather than film cameras. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300-meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone. NAIP imagery is typically acquired at a ground sample distance (GSD) with a horizontal accuracy that matches within of photo-identifiable ground control points, although these parameters do change over time. Starting in 2016, new imagery were acquired with a horizontal accuracy of +/-, and starting in 2018, new imagery were acquired with GSD of . The default spectral resolution is natural color (Red, Green and Blue, or RGB) but beginning in 2007, some states have been delivered with four bands of data: RGB and Near Infrared. Images have no more than 10% cloud cover per quarter quad tile, weather conditions permitting. Potential changes in licensing The FSA is considering a program change to availability and licensing for products of the NAIP beyond the 2018 fiscal year. Under review are a switch from a public domain program to a Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) licensing model. This change would require all users to begin paying for services and data, an effort that the FSA hopes would supplement 2018 budget reductions and lapses in funding from cost-share partners. A final decision, originally expected on May 1, 2018, was delayed in order to give the FSA additional time to research options for continuing the program. At issue is the acquisition strategy for the data. Options under discussion include eliminating full state coverage to acquire agriculture-only land, restricting coverage to ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù agriculture states, and/or using the COTS licensing model. FSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would continue to work towards a positive solution that benefits all stakeholders. The delayed decision meant that the NAIP would remain a public domain program for image data acquired through 2019.

The album follows the previous year's EP release Get Up Yourself, of which several references are made to. Continuing the band's more rock-oriented explorations since their debut, the album features several recurring motifs, both musical and lyrical and can be considered a loose concept album. The album's concept is that of the fictional, and perhaps metaphorical, 'Surface Paradise', which is most specifically referred to in the album's title tracks. The paradise itself is directly mentioned as a being like a supermarket, yet it is likely to be a non-physical place, where the world's trendy and elite are seen to reside. The album features extensive liner notes, tying into the album's conceptual themes. Rather than featuring any traditional descriptions of the songs, the notes are exhibited as several pages taken from a book. The book appears to deal with the band's eponymous 'Root' character, as well as the characters 'The Unit' and 'Tyfani'.

It has no relationship to the early 20th century British or American magazines of the same name. History First issued in 1961, Everybody's was published by Australian Consolidated Press (ACP). It evolved from an earlier ACP tabloid magazine, Weekend, which flourished in the 1950s. Weekend was edited by Donald Horne for many years and one of its most famous staffers was renowned journalist and rock writer Lillian Roxon, who wrote for the magazine for several years in the mid-1950s before moving to New York. According to Roxon's biographer Robert Milliken, Weekend had a dubious reputation in \\"polite society\\" and was considered very downmarket since it regularly featured lurid stories, often with sexual overtones. Roxon's mother was reportedly horrified by the idea of her daughter working for such a publication and concealed the fact from friends and family.Robert Millikan - Lillian Roxon: Mother of Rock (Black Inc, Melbourne, 2002) When Weekend was relaunched as Everybody's, it also replaced the venerable women's magazine the Australian Woman's Mirror, which was first published in 1924 and ceased publication in mid-1961. Copies of Everybody's from this period indicate that it was definitely a \\"women's\\" magazine in its early days, featuring almost exclusively women on the covers, with typical content including celebrity stories, cooking, interior decorating and fashion. Notable contributor Noted Australian cartoonist, illustrator and artist Marie \\"Mollie\\" Horseman (1911‚Äì1974) was a contributor to Everybody's during the early 1960s. Her numerous illustrations (either anonymous or signed \\"Vanessa\\") included full-page colour cartoons of the \\"Sexy Man\\" type and the serial Girl Crusoe (1964), a parody of the popular 'good girl cheesecake' comic (see good girl art). In 1963 Everybody's hailed her (somewhat inaccurately) as 'Australia's only woman cartoonist', although she was definitely the best known.. Other freelance contributors included Ken Emerson, John Petersen, Astra Dick, Theo Batten, Stewart McCrae and Arthur McNeil. The original staff artists on the magazine when it was first published were Lyle Nagel (art director), Oliver ‚ÄúOlli‚Äù Houghton, Charles Benison, Trevor Wells, Jill Marshall and Herman ‚ÄúJonah‚Äù Lloyd-Jones. At the start of 1962 Lindsay Foyle joined the staff. Australian Dictionary of Biography: Marie \\"Mollie\\" Compston Horseman Becoming a pop culture magazine As the 'Beat Boom' in popular music took off in Australia in 1963-1964 Everybody's began to cater for the burgeoning teenage market. Its content increasingly featured stories and pinups of local and international pop music, movie and TV personalities, although it still made regular excursions into tabloid territory, as evidenced by 'teaser' cover slogans like \\"Black Mass in Color: Shock Witchcraft Pictures\\", \\"The World's Most Topless City\\", \\"Trade Secrets of a Female Impersonator\\", \\"The World's Most Famous Nudes\\", \\"Those nude films\\", \\"What goes on in the suburbs?\\" and \\"Jayne Mansfield Tells All: Those Lewd Film Star Orgies\\". Australian pop culture historian Jeffery Turnbull described Everybody's as: :\\"... really the ultimate magazine for Australia‚Äôs popular culture throughout the pre-Go-Set, early ‚ÄòSixties because it covered the biggest stars of the period and wasn‚Äôt afraid to feature young Australian rock stars. It was published by the Packer organisation in Sydney but its circulation was national and in fact international, as it reached New Zealand readers. It did, however lean towards the Sydney scene. Kiwi musicians Mike Rudd (Spectrum and Ariel) and Glyn Mason (Ariel, Chain, Copperwine, Stockley See & Mason) have both spoken of the influence which Everybody‚Äôs had on New Zealanders in informing them of the swingin‚Äô scene in Australia. Just to read about what was happening in Australia was enough to convince them to relocate across the Tasman Sea with their respective New Zealand Bands, Chants R & B and Larry‚Äôs Rebels.\\" Market :\\"Everybody‚Äôs was not effectively targeting the teen market as such, but aimed itself more towards the young adult profile and was a quality pictorial although at times it delved into the sort of stories that the lower quality tabloids liked to feature. From about 1964, it incorporated Disc magazine -‚Äì an insert specially dedicated to pop music and this was only really superseded when Go-Set came along. It covered everything from Australian lifestyle to views on current issues as well as fashion. Its format was colourful and bold and at times, it wasn‚Äôt afraid to feature the more insalubrious aspects of the new teen culture.\\" :\\"Possibly for the first time, Aussie rock and pop artists were featured -- often on the cover. In 1967, The Masters Apprentices were presented with a trophy from Everybody‚Äôs as the ‚ÄúMost Original Band‚Äù for that year. Everybody‚Äôs was, like Pix, People and Australasian Post open to featuring the more liberalised attitudes towards sex. Towards the latter part of the ‚ÄòSixties, this magazine found a strong challenger in Go-Set which began to focus even closer on the teen readership market. By 1968, all eyes were on the Melbourne scene and Everybody‚Äôs succumbed to the punches delivered by its new challenger, ceasing publication in that year.\\".Jeffrey Turnbull, Melbourne Music in Print ‚Äì Go-Set Magazine ‚Äì February 1966 to August 1974 Everybody's enjoyed a comfortable relationship with Festival Records, which was owned by ACP's rival News Limited (now News Corporation), and it did much to promote Festival artists such as Jimmy Little, whom it named \\"Australian Pop Star of the Year\\" in 1964. The magazine also covered a range of social trends; in 1964 it examined the \\"new beach cult\\" and fretted about the \\"surfies\\" -- \\"they come from good homes, they are well educated, why then, do they turn into common larrikins?\\" Everybody's also included cartoons, most notably The Phantom by Lee Falk. :\\"When The Phantom finished in the last issue of The Australian Woman's Mirror in June 1961, it was almost immediately picked up in Everybody's. The last story to appear in the Woman's Mirror was \\"The River Gang\\" (S54) but only the first eight weeks of the 20-week story were published. It is not known if this story was completed in Everybody's magazine. However, the next story \\"The Honeymooners\\" (S55) certainly was, and the weekly magazine continued with The Phantom Sunday strips in sequential order. The one exception was \\"The Astronaut and the Pirates\\" (S61) which was initially skipped before making an appearance a few years later. As with the Woman's Mirror, The Phantom strips in Everybody's magazine were about 16 months behind the original US newspaper appearance date. The last known Phantom story to appear in Everybody's magazine was \\"Rex King\\" (S68) in 1967. The magazine was cancelled in 1968 although it is not known if The Phantom continued until the end.\\"Bryan Shedden - \\"The Phantom: A Publishing History in Australia\\" The magazine also played a role in launching the career of TV and pop personality Denise Drysdale. :\\"Barry Bell at Channel 9 had taken some photos of me in a bikini for Everybody's Magazine, and that magazine had gone over to Vietnam, and American soldiers saw me, got in touch with Everybody's Magazine, and so they gave me 'Girl of the Year' \\".Denise Drysdale interview, Talking Heads, ABC-TV, 1 May 2006 Competition Everybody's dominance was challenged in early 1966 with the appearance of a new Melbourne-based weekly pop magazine, Go-Set, which was launched by a group of former Monash University students. Although Everybody's enjoyed the advantage of being published by a large company and had an established national readership, its position in the teenage market was quickly usurped, and from 1967 until its closure in 1974, Go-Set reigned supreme as Australia's pop culture 'bible'. In 1966 Everybody's attempted to expand its operations by starting up its own Everybody's record label, with the intention of selling singles via the magazine. The new label was a joint venture between Clyde Packer and Harry M. Miller and was managed by American-born entrepreneur, producer and songwriter Nat Kipner. The new label was not well received by commercial radio stations, however, and some Sydney stations reportedly refused to play the label's inaugural single, Tony Barber's \\"Someday\\", because it was seen as blatant cross-promotion for the magazine. As a result, the label was hastily relaunched as Spin Records, and it became one of the most significant local pop labels of the late 1960s. By the late 1960s the focus of the Australian pop scene was firmly in Melbourne and while Go-Set (which was also based in Melbourne) evolved with the times and developed close links with the local pop scene, Everybody's essentially retained the one-dimensional \\"fanzine\\" style it had developed in the early 60s. Its circulation gradually declined, out-competed by the 'hipper' style of Go-Set, and it ceased publication during 1968.

The Palace took 7 years to complete, from 1877 to 1884, costing about seven lakhs of rupees. Being an excellent specimen of Indian architecture built in black polished stone, it has been an attraction for tourists. It has extensive premises with a garden, fountain and wrestling ground. The whole building is eight-angled and has a tower in the middle. The clock on it was fixed in 1877. At separate distances there are small towers. On every glass are painted the events in Shivaji's life, the founder of Maratha Empire. There is a zoo and a ground lake. Even today, it is the residence of Shahu, the direct descendant of Shivaji. Mant's masterpiece at Kolhapur, however, is the New Palace, 1.5 km further north on Bhausingji Road. Completed in the same year as the Hospital, this complex presents a novel blend of disparate features in contrasting basalt and sandstone. The principal south facade presents a double-storeyed range, with Neo-Mughal lobed arches beneath and temple-like columns and brackets above. This scheme is interrupted by trefoil arches capped with curving cornices and small domes. The same elements cap the octagonal corner towers. The ground floor of the New Palace accommodates the Shahaji Chhatrapati Museum, given over to memorabilia of the Kolhapur rulers. Several tourists from across the country visit the New Palace each year. This museum exhibits royal ways of existence. It is dedicated to a fine collection of possessions of Chhatrapatis of Kolhapur like costumes, weapons, games, jewellery, embroidery and paraphernalia such as silver elephant saddles. A letter from the British Viceroy and Governor General of India is the other memorabilia. There is also one of Aurangzeb's swords at the Shahaji Chhatrapati Museum. One section has stuffed Tigers, Tiger heads, Wild Dog, Sloth Bear, staring Wild Buffalo, Lion, Black Panther, Wild Boar, Black Buck, a number of other Deer varieties, and a Himalayan Black Bear. The Darbar Hall occupies a double-height space in middle of the Palace. The side walls display lobed arches filled with stained glass illustrating scenes from the life of Shivaji; carved columns with temple-like brackets support the cast iron balcony above. A raised throne is placed at one end of the Hall. Photos include one of the Maharajah with his hundredth dead tiger, elephant hunts and a series detailing how to train a cheetah.

It is a long-lived climax rainforest tree from eastern Australia. Unlike most acacias, fire is not required for seed germination. This tree is considered vulnerable to extinction. Its former habitat is lowland sub tropical rainforest which has been mostly cleared in the 19th and 20th centuries. Description The tree is found with heights of but must often is found with a height of around and has an erect to spreading habit. The grey to greyish brown coloured bark is finely fissured or sometimes smooth. It has reddish coloured, terete and glabrous branchlets. Like most Acacias it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes have an elliptic to broadly elliptic shape and are straight to slightly curved with a length of and a width of and have three to four prominent veins. It usually flowers in the spring and produces inflorescences that appear singly on the raceme axis. The spherical flower- heads have a diameter of and contain 15 to 30 pale yellow to cream-coloured flowers. The firmly papery to thinly leathery seed pods that form after flowering are straight or curved and flat but can be constricted between the seeds. The pods are in length and wide containing longitudinally arranged seeds. The sub-shiny dark brown seeds are flattened and have an oblong to broadly elliptic shape and a length of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1896 as part of the work A giant Acacia from the Brunswick River as published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. It was reclassified as Racosperma bakeri by Leslie Pedley in 1987 the transferred back to genus Acacia in 2001. The specific epithet honours Richard Thomas Baker who worked for the Sydney Technological Museum and collected the type specimen. It is thought to be allied with Acacia binervata and part of a group of species closely related Acacia rothii. Distribution The natural range of distribution is from Brunswick Heads and Mullumbimby in north eastern New South Wales to around the Burrum River in the Maryborough of south eastern Queensland where it is commonly a part of wet sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest and rainforest communities. It grows usually in lowland areas with volcanic and alluvial soils.

Joining the Mercantile Marine as a youth, he became a pilot in Britain's Royal Naval Air Service during World War I. In 1918, he was given command of No. 223 Squadron in the newly formed Royal Air Force. The following year he took charge of No. 270 Squadron RAF in Egypt. Returning to Australia, De La Rue joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps in 1920, and became a founding member of the RAAF in March 1921. Specialising in maritime aviation, he led seaplane formations based at Point Cook, Victoria, during the 1920s and early 1930s. De La Rue was appointed commanding officer of No. 1 Flying Training School at Point Cook in 1933. He was promoted to group captain in 1937 and took command of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, the following year. At the outbreak of World War II, De La Rue was slated to lead an air expeditionary force to Great Britain, but this plan was abandoned after Australia committed itself to the Empire Air Training Scheme. Promoted to temporary air commodore, he served as Air Officer Commanding Western Area from 1941 to 1943, and finished the war as Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Nicknamed \\"Kanga\\", De La Rue retired from the Air Force in 1946, and died in 1977 at the age of eighty-six. Early life and World War I Born on 13 March 1891 in Auburn, a suburb of Sydney, De La Rue was the son of jeweller Edmond Emile De La Rue and his wife Ellen. Following a \\"limited\\" education, he joined the Merchant Navy in 1908, becoming a second officer by 1914.Coulthard-Clark, \\"De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand\\" De La Rue transferred to the Royal Navy's Transport Service shortly after the outbreak of World War I, operating on troop ships between England and France.Alexander, Who's Who in Australia 1965, pp. 238‚Äì239 He saw service at Gallipoli as navigator on Huntsgreen, from the Allied landings on 25 April 1915 until the withdrawal in December. In July 1916, he transferred once again, to the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant, and was awarded his wings in November. Training as a seaplane pilot in Hampshire, De La Rue was posted to Wales in February 1917. Later that year, he claimed an unconfirmed sinking of a German submarine while on coastal patrol. Promoted flight lieutenant in January 1918, De La Rue became an honorary captain in the Royal Air Force (RAF) that April, following the merger of the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps. He was posted to No. 223 Squadron in Otranto, Italy, later taking command of the unit. While piloting a Short seaplane escorting Allied bombers on a raid against the port city of Durr√´s, Albania, he rescued the crew of another seaplane that had been forced down in the Austrian-held harbour. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions, as well as the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. Between the wars De La Rue was posted to Alexandria, Egypt, in January 1919 to command No. 270 (Seaplane) Squadron. Offered a permanent commission in the RAF that August, he nevertheless returned to Australia and sought employment through Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble, an ex-RNAS pilot then seconded to the Navy Office. Goble, desiring a specialist seaplane pilot for naval cooperation work, arranged a captain's commission in the recently established Australian Air Corps, successor to the wartime Australian Flying Corps.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 20 On 17 June 1920, in an Airco DH.9A, De La Rue accompanied Captain Adrian Cole on a flight to an altitude of , setting an Australian record that stood for more than ten years.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 23 Later that month, flying an Avro 504L floatplane, he became the first person to land an aircraft on the Yarra River in Victoria.Wilson, Military Aircraft of Australia, p. 25 In July he was put in charge of trials of the Avro 504L aboard the Royal Australian Navy's flagship, HMAS Australia.Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, p. 12 De La Rue joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flight lieutenant in 1921, becoming one of the original twenty-one officers on its strength when it was formed (as the Australian Air Force) that March.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 16Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 42 Going by the first name of Frank, he was also popularly known throughout the service as \\"Kanga\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 35Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 31, 334 In August 1921, he underwent the RAAF's \\"No. 1 Course\\" at the Australian Army's Central Training Depot in Holsworthy, New South Wales; his fellow inductees included Flying Officers George Jones, Arthur Murphy, and Raymond Brownell.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 38‚Äì40 alt=Three- quarter rear view of biplane on floats, taxiing along a stretch of water towards shore During the 1920s, De La Rue held a series of postings at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, and at Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne. In May 1922, then in charge of the Seaplane Flight, he crashed an Avro 504L into Port Phillip; his rescuers claimed that his main concern following the mishap was the state of the corduroy trousers he was wearing. He lost the RAAF's sole Bristol Scout in another accident less than a year later.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 157 De La Rue married Clara Stone in a Presbyterian ceremony at Scots Church, Melbourne, on 1 October 1923; the couple would have a daughter. He had another escape in August 1925 when he crashed a Sopwith Pup into a hangar; a witness said that De La Rue, who was \\"renowned for his fiery Gallic temper\\", strode from the wreckage and began to violently abuse the aircraft.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 166 By 1926, De La Rue was the examining officer on the flight instructors course at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS), Point Cook.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 18 On exchange in Britain during 1929‚Äì30, De La Rue underwent familiarisation with aircraft carriers, and served on the staff of No. 201 (Flying Boat) Squadron, based on the south coast of England. Upon his return to Australia in 1931, he was given command of the RAAF's Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook. Promoted wing commander in December 1932, De La Rue led No. 1 FTS from early 1933. He was promoted group captain in January 1937, and took over as commanding officer (CO) of Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, from Group Captain Cole in January the following year.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 113 World War II De La Rue and his staff at Headquarters Richmond worked \\"flat out\\" in the days prior the outbreak of World War II to get the base to a fit state of readiness and, immediately after hostilities were declared on 3 September, to liaise with the Central War Room in Melbourne passing instructions to squadrons. The following day, Richmond's first wartime sortie took place, a flight of three Avro Ansons and three Supermarine Seagulls patrolling the ocean off Sydney.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 62‚Äì63 Within a month the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Vice Marshal Goble, proposed despatching a six-squadron air expeditionary force to Great Britain, with De La Rue, then the RAAF's seventh most senior officer, in charge. Air Marshal Richard Williams, Goble's long-time rival for leadership of the Air Force in the 1920s and '30s, later contended that the CAS was unduly favouring his fellow RNAS veteran and seaplane specialist to lead what would have been the RAAF's largest formation to date, particularly considering that other contenders for the role such as Group Captains Cole, Frank McNamara, and Henry Wrigley had greater landplane experience than De La Rue. The concept was in any case abandoned soon after, as Australia concentrated on participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 456‚Äì458 Some time in the latter half of 1940, De La Rue was seeing dinner guests off the base at RAAF Richmond, and attempted to re-enter the perimeter via the main gate. Wearing civilian clothes and without his security pass, he was challenged and then locked up by the guards, who did not recognise him or believe his assurances that he was their commander. De La Rue was finally released by the orderly officer but was still fuming the next morning; only the advice of the base warrant officer (disciplinary), who had congratulated the guards on their diligence, prevented the CO from taking action against all concerned.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 66‚Äì67 alt=Two columns of men, some in military uniforms with peaked caps, some in civilian clothes, walking between two rows of troops with forage caps standing to attention with rifles and fixed bayonets, and further rows of troops behind them After completing his tenure at Richmond, De La Rue briefly took the role of senior air staff officer (SASO) at Central Area Command in October 1940. The following month, his name was put forward to establish an RAAF depot in London to look after the interests of the many thousands of Australian airmen disembarking there, but financial considerations led to the plan being scuppered temporarily.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 113Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 108‚Äì110 In fact, RAAF Overseas Headquarters would be formed on 1 December 1941, with Air Marshal Williams appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC).Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 113‚Äì116Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 118‚Äì120 Meanwhile, De La Rue also missed out on a potential posting to the Middle East that was suggested by the British but turned down by the Australian government. Promoted acting air commodore, he became the inaugural AOC Western Area, headquartered in Perth, on 9 January 1941.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 92 Among the units he controlled in this position were No. 14 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, No. 25 (General Purpose) Squadron, No. 35 (Transport) Squadron, and No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, p. 300 De La Rue worked assiduously to prepare the latter for operations, as it was the only fighter squadron able to defend Perth and Fremantle.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 19 He also lobbied RAAF Headquarters for a force of long-range PBY Catalina flying boats to augment the Lockheed Hudsons of No. 14 Squadron, but none were offered to him.Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, pp. 72‚Äì73 De La Rue was made a temporary air commodore in July 1941.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, p. 294 By February 1942, he was the eighth most senior officer in the RAAF.Stephens, Power With Attitude, p. 86 Handing over Western Area Command to Air Commodore Ray Brownell in January 1943, De La Rue became Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, in which post he saw out the rest of the war.

Later life De La Rue was summarily retired from the RAAF after the war, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, partly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers, and also due to his suspect health. In recommending early retirement, the CAS, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, noted that De La Rue possessed \\"fairly good Service knowledge\\" and was of strong character, but that \\"sometimes his efforts [were] ill- directed\\".Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 234Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 179‚Äì181 De La Rue was, furthermore, above the statutory retiring age for his substantive rank of group captain.Stephens, Power With Attitude, p. 92 He was officially discharged on 1 April 1946.De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand at World War 2 Nominal roll.

The monarch is regarded internally as the absolute authority, or \\"sole prerogative\\", and the source of many of the executive powers of the British government. Prerogative powers were formerly exercised by the monarch acting on his or her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet‚Äîwho are then accountable to Parliament for the decision‚Äîhas been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question. Today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarch has a significant constitutional weight in these and other matters, but limited freedom to act, because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials. Definition William Blackstone, who maintained that the royal prerogative was any power that could be exercised by only the monarch The royal prerogative has been called \\"a notoriously difficult concept to define adequately\\", but whether a particular type of prerogative power exists is a matter of common law to be decided by the courts as the final arbiter. A prominent constitutional theorist, A. V. Dicey, proposed in the nineteenth century that: While many commentators follow the Diceyan view, there are constitutional lawyers who prefer the definition given by William Blackstone in the 1760s:Loveland (2009) p. 92 Dicey's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative diverges from Blackstone's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the United Kingdom can undertake, such as declaration of war. Case law exists to support both views. Blackstone's notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by Lord Parmoor in the De Keyser's Royal Hotel case of 1920, but some difficulty with it was expressed by Lord Reid in the Burmah Oil case of 1965. A clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases, and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself.Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers: Final Report, Chapter Two paragraph 26 History Sir Edward Coke, who held that the prerogative did not allow the monarch to sit as a judge The royal prerogative originated as the personal power of the monarch. From the 13th century in England, as in France, the monarch was all-powerful, but this absolute power was checked by \\"the recrudescence of feudal turbulence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\\". An early attempt to define the royal prerogative was stated by Richard II's judges in 1387.Keen, Maurice Hugh England in the later middle ages: a political history Methuen & Co (1973) p281Chrimes, S. B. Richard II's questions to the judges 1387 in Law Quarterly Review lxxii: 365‚Äì90 (1956) During the 16th century, this \\"turbulence\\" began to recede, and the monarch became truly independent. Under Henry VIII and his successors, the king was the head of the Protestant English church, and therefore not answerable to the clergy. The rise of Parliament in this period, however, was problematic. While the monarch was \\"the predominant partner in the English constitution\\", the courts stopped short of declaring him all- powerful, recognising the role that Parliament played.Holdsworth (1921) p. 554 In Ferrer's Case,1 Parl. Hist. 555 Henry recognised this, noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of Parliament than without. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the matter of taxation: Sir Thomas Smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without Parliament's consent.Holdsworth (1921) p. 555 At the same time, Henry and his descendants normally followed the will of the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges. William Holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent, Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law. He also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all \\"was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the Tudor period\\".Holdsworth (1921) p. 556 It was accepted that while the King had \\"unfettered discretion\\", he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions on the use of the prerogative, or where he had chosen to do so.Holdsworth (1921) p. 561 The first dent in this stability came about in 1607, with the Case of Prohibitions. James VI and I claimed that as monarch, he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit. Led by Sir Edward Coke, the judiciary rejected this idea, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; Coke pointed out that such knowledge \\"demanded mastery of an artificial reason ... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it\\". Similarly, in the Case of Proclamations in 1611, Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones.Loveland (2009) p. 87 With the Glorious Revolution, King James VII and II was replaced by Queen Mary II and her husband King William III. At the same time the Bill of Rights 1689 was drafted, which cemented the monarch's subservience to Parliament. It specifically limited the royal prerogative, with Article 1 holding that the \\"power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal\\", and article 4 confirming that \\"levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal\\". The Bill also confirmed that Parliament had the right to limit the use of remaining prerogatives, as evidenced by the Triennial Act 1694, which required the monarch to dismiss and call Parliament at certain times.Loveland (2009) p. 91 Prerogative powers=Legislature = William IV, the last monarch to arbitrarily dissolve Parliament by using the royal prerogative One of the monarch's historic prerogatives was the dissolution of Parliament, which was \\"perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy.\\"Barnett (2009) p. 106 This prerogative was normally exercised at the request of Parliament and the prime minister, either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence. Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves \\"the acquiescence of ministers\\", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent; \\"if ministers refuse to give such advice, she can do no more than dismiss them\\". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that \\"an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors ... A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation.\\"Barnett (2009) p. 107 The monarch could force the dissolution of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent; this would very likely lead to a government resigning. By convention, the monarch always assents to bills; the last time the royal assent was not given was in 1708 during the reign of Queen Anne when, on ministerial advice, she withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill. This does not mean that the right to refuse, even contrary to the wishes of the Prime Minister, has died: the threat of the Royal Veto by George III and George IV made Catholic Emancipation impossible between 1800 and 1829, whilst George V had been privately advised (by his own lawyer, not by the Prime Minister) that he could veto the Third Irish Home Rule Bill; Jennings writes that \\"it was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent\\".Barnett (2009) p. 109 The royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament was abrogated by Section 3(2) of the Fixed- term Parliaments Act 2011.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/3/enacted Section 6(1) of the Act however specifically states that the monarch's power to prorogue Parliament is not affected by the Act.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/6/enacted Nonetheless, the Supreme Court's 2019 judgment in Miller II established that the prerogative of prorogation is not absolute. The appointment of the prime minister is also, theoretically, governed by the royal prerogative. Technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint, but in practice the appointee is always the person who is best placed to command a majority in the House of Commons. Usually, this is the leader of the political party that is returned to Parliament with a majority of seats after a general election. Difficulties may result with a so-called hung parliament, in which no party commands majority support, as last occurred in 2017. In this situation, constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment.Barnett (2009) p. 114 If the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session, then unless there is a clear \\"prime minister-in-waiting\\" (eg. Neville Chamberlain in 1937 or Anthony Eden in 1955) the monarch in principle has to choose a successor (after taking appropriate advice, not necessarily from the outgoing prime minister), but the last monarch to be actively involved in such a process was George V, who appointed Stanley Baldwin rather than Lord Curzon in 1923. In more modern times, the monarch left it to the politicians involved to choose a successor through private consultations (Winston Churchill in May 1940, Harold Macmillan in January 1957, Alec Douglas-Home in October 1963). Nowadays, the monarch has no discretion, as the governing party will elect a new leader who will near- automatically be appointed as he or she commands the support of the majority of the Commons (most recently Theresa May in 2016 or Boris Johnson in 2019).Barnett (2009) p. 115 =Judicial system= The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate the \\"pains, penalties and punishments\\" from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service,[1985] AC 374 but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley.[1994] Q.B. 349Barnett (2009) p. 116 Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) in the name of the crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not reviewable by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.Barnett (2009) p. 117 =Foreign affairs= The royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annex territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King.[1905] 2 KB 391 Monarchs also have the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Their freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought.Loveland (2009) p. 120 Monarchs can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2),[2008] UKHL 61 the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.Loveland (2009) p. 121 A judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal in 1988 (ex parte Everett), and re-stated in a ruling of the High Court delivered in July 2016,R (XH & Another) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWHC 1898 (Admin) (Hamblen LJ, Cranston J) 28 July 2016 confirmed that granting or withdrawing British passports has always been an exercise of the royal prerogative, and continues to be exercisable at the Secretary of State's discretion. Under the common law, citizens have the right freely to leave and enter the United Kingdom. In R v Foreign Secretary, ex parte Everett,[1989] QB 811, [1988] EWCA Civ 7, [1989] 2 WLR 224 http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1988/7.html the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to, and the withholding of passports from, British citizens. The writ of ne exeat regno is also used to prevent a person leaving the country. The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power: under Blackstone's definition, a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch.Loveland (2009) p. 122 =Other prerogative powers= Monarchs also have power to exercise their prerogative over the granting of honours, the regulation of the armed forces and ecclesiastical appointments.The Appointment of Bishops Act 1533 Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant.Loveland (2009) p. 118 In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts.Loveland (2009) p. 119 This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory.Ministry of Justice (2009) p.14 The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England,Ministry of Justice (2009) p. 4 and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible.Ministry of Justice (2009) p. 33 The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on his or her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority, recognised that the prerogative also includes the power to \\"take all reasonable steps to preserve the Queen's peace\\", and in Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate, the House of Lords took the view that it extended to \\"doing all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of [the Second World War].\\"Carroll (2007) p. 251 Use Today, the monarch exercises the prerogative almost exclusively in line with the advice of the government. Leyland notes that: In simple terms, the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the Crown; although the monarch has the \\"right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\\", an action in that role involves no exercise of discretion.Bagehot (2001) p. 111 Today, some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. Both the above links broken, original now available here (retrieved 9 November 2016). Prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but on the advice of the prime minister (whom the monarch meets weekly) and of the cabinet.The Royal Household, Queen and Prime Minister Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative, but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis.Leyland (2007)p. 67 =Limitations= Several influential decisions of the House of Lords have determined the limited scope for the use of prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, Re Petition of Right (\\"Shoreham Aerodrome Case\\"), but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation.Petition of Right, In re A ('Shoreham Aerodrome Case') [1915] 3 K.B. 649, cited in The case of requisition: in re a petition of right of De Keyser's Royal Hotel Limited: De Keyser's Royal Hotel Limited v. the King (1920), Leslie Scott and Alfred Hildesley, with Introduction by Sir John Simon, Clarendon Press, 1920 The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown, both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative, was entitled to take and occupy, for military purposes in wartime, a commercial airfield on the south coast. The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised, the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists. This was backed up by The Zamora (1916),Privy Council, The Zamora, On Appeal from the High Court, Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division. (In Prize.) Powers of King in Council ‚Äì Royal Prerogative ‚Äì Extent to which Orders in Council are binding ‚Äì Inherent Powers of the Court ‚Äì Preservation of Property in Specie ‚Äì Neutral Cargo ‚Äì Contraband ‚Äì Seizure as Prize ‚Äì Requisition before Adjudication ‚Äì Validity ‚Äì Prize Court Rules. where the Privy Council, on appeal from the Prize Court, held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute (such as a prerogative power) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified.Loveland (2009) p. 93 The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd (1920),[1920] UKHL 1 where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use \\"abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent ‚Äì that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance\\".Loveland (2009) p. 97 This principle of statutory superiority was extended in Laker Airway Ltd v Department of Trade, concerning the revocation of a commercial airline operator's licence (December 1976),Laker Airway Ltd v Department of Trade [1977] QB 643, [1976] EWCA Civ 10 where it was confirmed that prerogative powers could not be used to contradict a statutory provision, and that in situations to which the power and the statute both applied, the power could only be used to further the aim of the statute.Loveland (2009) p. 99 Another extension came with R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union,1995 2 AC 513 where the Court of Appeal held that even if a statute had not yet come into force, the prerogative could not be used to \\"conflict with Parliament's wishes\\" (in that case using its discretion to choose a start date to delay, perhaps indefinitely, the introduction of a statutory compensation scheme).Loveland (2009) p. 101 Whilst the royal prerogative is deployed by the UK government when making (and unmaking) treaties, the Supreme Court held in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union that the government could not use the prerogative to serve notice of termination of the UK's membership of the EU (under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union). Instead legislative authority via an Act of Parliament was required by the Government. The Court's reasoning in the initial hearing was that such a notice would inevitably affect rights under domestic law (many EU rights having direct effect in the UK). On the assumption ‚Äì later proven false ‚Äì that triggering Article 50 would inevitably result in Brexit, using the prerogative in this way would therefore frustrate the intention of Parliament to confer those rights. This reasoning was maintained in the subsequent Supreme Court hearing, although that judgement devoted more attention to the fact that Parliament had voted the UK into what was then the EEC by statute in 1972, which under the principle of De Keyser's Hotel (1920) superseded the normal prerogative power to enter into treaties. Following this decision, Parliament decided to provide legal authorisation to the Government to serve a notice in accordance with Article 50. This was duly granted in the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and Theresa May exercised the power on 29 March 2017. =Judicial review= Before the modern judicial review procedure superseded the petition of right as the remedy for challenging the validity of a prerogative power, the courts were traditionally only willing to state whether or not powers existed, not whether they had been used appropriately. They therefore applied only the first of the Wednesbury tests: whether the use was illegal. Constitutional scholars such as William Blackstone consider this appropriate: During the 1960s and 70s this attitude was changing, with Lord Denning saying in the Laker Airway case that \\"seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive.\\" The most authoritative case on the matter is Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, generally known as the GCHQ case. The House of Lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent on the nature of the government's powers, not their source. Foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review, while the prerogative of mercy is considered within it, as per R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley.Loveland (2009) p. 108 Reform Abolition of the royal prerogative is not imminent, and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful.Leyland (2007) p. 78 The Ministry of Justice undertook a \\"review of executive Royal Prerogative powers\\" in October 2009.Ministry of Justice (2009) p. 1 Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Tony Benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval. Later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation.

The phrase mobile device usually refers to mobile phones; however, it can also relate to any digital device that has both internal memory and communication ability, including PDA devices, GPS devices and tablet computers. The use of mobile phones/devices in crime was widely recognised for some years, but the forensic study of mobile devices is a relatively new field, dating from the late 1990s and early 2000s. A proliferation of phones (particularly smartphones) and other digital devices on the consumer market caused a demand for forensic examination of the devices, which could not be met by existing computer forensics techniques. Mobile devices can be used to save several types of personal information such as contacts, photos, calendars and notes, SMS and MMS messages. Smartphones may additionally contain video, email, web browsing information, location information, and social networking messages and contacts. There is growing need for mobile forensics due to several reasons and some of the prominent reasons are: * Use of mobile phones to store and transmit personal and corporate information * Use of mobile phones in online transactions * Law enforcement, criminals and mobile phone devices Mobile device forensics can be particularly challenging on a number of levels: Evidential and technical challenges exist. for example, cell site analysis following from the use of a mobile phone usage coverage, is not an exact science. Consequently, whilst it is possible to determine roughly the cell site zone from which a call was made or received, it is not yet possible to say with any degree of certainty, that a mobile phone call emanated from a specific location e.g. a residential address. *To remain competitive, original equipment manufacturers frequently change mobile phone form factors, operating system file structures, data storage, services, peripherals, and even pin connectors and cables. As a result, forensic examiners must use a different forensic process compared to computer forensics. *Storage capacity continues to grow thanks to demand for more powerful \\"mini computer\\" type devices. *Not only the types of data but also the way mobile devices are used constantly evolve. *Hibernation behaviour in which processes are suspended when the device is powered off or idle but at the same time, remaining active. As a result of these challenges, a wide variety of tools exist to extract evidence from mobile devices; no one tool or method can acquire all the evidence from all devices. It is therefore recommended that forensic examiners, especially those wishing to qualify as expert witnesses in court, undergo extensive training in order to understand how each tool and method acquires evidence; how it maintains standards for forensic soundness; and how it meets legal requirements such as the Daubert standard or Frye standard. History As a field of study forensic examination of mobile devices dates from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The role of mobile phones in crime had long been recognized by law enforcement. With the increased availability of such devices on the consumer market and the wider array of communication platforms they support (e.g. email, web browsing) demand for forensic examination grew. Early efforts to examine mobile devices used similar techniques to the first computer forensics investigations: analysing phone contents directly via the screen and photographing important content. However, this proved to be a time- consuming process, and as the number of mobile devices began to increase, investigators called for more efficient means of extracting data. Enterprising mobile forensic examiners sometimes used cell phone or PDA synchronization software to \\"back up\\" device data to a forensic computer for imaging, or sometimes, simply performed computer forensics on the hard drive of a suspect computer where data had been synchronized. However, this type of software could write to the phone as well as reading it, and could not retrieve deleted data. Some forensic examiners found that they could retrieve even deleted data using \\"flasher\\" or \\"twister\\" boxes, tools developed by OEMs to \\"flash\\" a phone's memory for debugging or updating. However, flasher boxes are invasive and can change data; can be complicated to use; and, because they are not developed as forensic tools, perform neither hash verifications nor (in most cases) audit trails. For physical forensic examinations, therefore, better alternatives remained necessary. To meet these demands, commercial tools appeared which allowed examiners to recover phone memory with minimal disruption and analyse it separately. Over time these commercial techniques have developed further and the recovery of deleted data from proprietary mobile devices has become possible with some specialist tools. Moreover, commercial tools have even automated much of the extraction process, rendering it possible even for minimally trained first responders‚Äîwho currently are much more likely to encounter suspects with mobile devices in their possession, compared to computers‚Äîto perform basic extractions for triage and data preview purposes.  Professional applications  Mobile device forensics is best known for its application to law enforcement investigations, but it is also useful for military intelligence, corporate investigations, private investigations, criminal and civil defense, and electronic discovery.  Types of evidence  As mobile device technology advances, the amount and types of data that can be found on a mobile device is constantly increasing. Evidence that can be potentially recovered from a mobile phone may come from several different sources, including handset memory, SIM card, and attached memory cards such as SD cards. Traditionally mobile phone forensics has been associated with recovering SMS and MMS messaging, as well as call logs, contact lists and phone IMEI/ESN information. However, newer generations of smartphones also include wider varieties of information; from web browsing, Wireless network settings, geolocation information (including geotags contained within image metadata), e-mail and other forms of rich internet media, including important data‚Äîsuch as social networking service posts and contacts‚Äînow retained on smartphone 'apps'. =Internal memory= Nowadays mostly flash memory consisting of NAND or NOR types are used for mobile devices.Salvatore Fiorillo. Theory and practice of flash memory mobile forensics. Theosecurity.com, December 2009. =External memory= External memory devices are SIM cards, SD cards (commonly found within GPS devices as well as mobile phones), MMC cards, CF cards, and the Memory Stick. =Service provider logs= Although not technically part of mobile device forensics, the call detail records (and occasionally, text messages) from wireless carriers often serve as \\"back up\\" evidence obtained after the mobile phone has been seized. These are useful when the call history and/or text messages have been deleted from the phone, or when location-based services are not turned on. Call detail records and cell site (tower) dumps can show the phone owner's location, and whether they were stationary or moving (i.e., whether the phone's signal bounced off the same side of a single tower, or different sides of multiple towers along a particular path of travel). Carrier data and device data together can be used to corroborate information from other sources, for instance, video surveillance footage or eyewitness accounts; or to determine the general location where a non-geotagged image or video was taken. The European Union requires its member countries to retain certain telecommunications data for use in investigations. This includes data on calls made and retrieved. The location of a mobile phone can be determined and this geographical data must also be retained. In the United States, however, no such requirement exists, and no standards govern how long carriers should retain data or even what they must retain. For example, text messages may be retained only for a week or two, while call logs may be retained anywhere from a few weeks to several months. To reduce the risk of evidence being lost, law enforcement agents must submit a preservation letter to the carrier, which they then must back up with a search warrant.  Forensic process  The forensics process for mobile devices broadly matches other branches of digital forensics; however, some particular concerns apply. Generally, the process can be broken down into three main categories: seizure, acquisition, and examination/analysis. Other aspects of the computer forensic process, such as intake, validation, documentation/reporting, and archiving still apply. =Seizure= Seizing mobile devices is covered by the same legal considerations as other digital media. Mobiles will often be recovered switched on; as the aim of seizure is to preserve evidence, the device will often be transported in the same state to avoid a shutdown, which would change files. In addition, the investigator or first responder would risk user lock activation. However, leaving the phone on carries another risk: the device can still make a network/cellular connection. This may bring in new data, overwriting evidence. To prevent a connection, mobile devices will often be transported and examined from within a Faraday cage (or bag). Even so, there are two disadvantages to this method. First, most bags render the device unusable, as its touch screen or keypad cannot be used. However, special cages can be acquired that allows the use of the device with a see-through glass and special gloves. The advantage with this option is the ability to also connect to other forensic equipment while blocking the network connection, as well as charging the device. If this option is not available, network isolation is advisable either through placing the device in Airplane Mode, or cloning its SIM card (a technique which can also be useful when the device is missing its SIM card entirely). It is to note that while this technique can prevent triggering a remote wipe (or tampering) of the device, it doesn't do anything against a local Dead man's switch. =Acquisition= iPhone in an RF shield bag RTL Aceso, a mobile device acquisition unit The second step in the forensic process is acquisition, in this case usually referring to retrieval of material from a device (as compared to the bit-copy imaging used in computer forensics). Due to the proprietary nature of mobiles it is often not possible to acquire data with it powered down; most mobile device acquisition is performed live. With more advanced smartphones using advanced memory management, connecting it to a recharger and putting it into a faraday cage may not be good practice. The mobile device would recognize the network disconnection and therefore it would change its status information that can trigger the memory manager to write data. Most acquisition tools for mobile devices are commercial in nature and consist of a hardware and software component, often automated. =Examination and analysis= As an increasing number of mobile devices use high-level file systems, similar to the file systems of computers, methods and tools can be taken over from hard disk forensics or only need slight changes. The FAT file system is generally used on NAND memory. A difference is the block size used, which is larger than 512 bytes for hard disks and depends on the used memory type, e.g., NOR type 64, 128, 256 and NAND memory 16, 128, 256, or 512 kilobyte. Different software tools can extract the data from the memory image. One could use specialized and automated forensic software products or generic file viewers such as any hex editor to search for characteristics of file headers. The advantage of the hex editor is the deeper insight into the memory management, but working with a hex editor means a lot of handwork and file system as well as file header knowledge. In contrast, specialized forensic software simplifies the search and extracts the data but may not find everything. AccessData, Sleuthkit, ESI Analyst and EnCase, to mention only some, are forensic software products to analyze memory images.Rick Ayers, Wayne Jansen, Nicolas Cilleros, and Ronan Daniellou. (October 2005). Retrieved from Cell Phone Forensic Tools: An Overview and Analysis. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Since there is no tool that extracts all possible information, it is advisable to use two or more tools for examination. There is currently (February 2010) no software solution to get all evidences from flash memories.  Data acquisition types  Mobile device data extraction can be classified according to a continuum, along which methods become more technical and ‚Äúforensically sound,‚Äù tools become more expensive, analysis takes longer, examiners need more training, and some methods can even become more invasive. =Manual acquisition= The examiner utilizes the user interface to investigate the content of the phone's memory. Therefore, the device is used as normal, with the examiner taking pictures of each screen's contents. This method has an advantage in that the operating system makes it unnecessary to use specialized tools or equipment to transform raw data into human interpretable information. In practice this method is applied to cell phones, PDAs and navigation systems.Eoghan Casey. Handbook of computer crime investigation ‚Äì forensic tools and technology. Academic Press, 2. edition, 2003. Disadvantages are that only data visible to the operating system can be recovered; that all data are only available in form of pictures; and the process itself is time-consuming. =Logical acquisition= Logical acquisition implies a bit-by-bit copy of logical storage objects (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical storage (e.g., a file system partition). Logical acquisition has the advantage that system data structures are easier for a tool to extract and organize. Logical extraction acquires information from the device using the original equipment manufacturer application programming interface for synchronizing the phone's contents with a personal computer. A logical extraction is generally easier to work with as it does not produce a large binary blob. However, a skilled forensic examiner will be able to extract far more information from a physical extraction. File system acquisition Logical extraction usually does not produce any deleted information, due to it normally being removed from the phone's file system. However, in some cases‚Äîparticularly with platforms built on SQLite, such as iOS and Android‚Äîthe phone may keep a database file of information which does not overwrite the information but simply marks it as deleted and available for later overwriting. In such cases, if the device allows file system access through its synchronization interface, it is possible to recover deleted information. File system extraction is useful for understanding the file structure, web browsing history, or app usage, as well as providing the examiner with the ability to perform an analysis with traditional computer forensic tools. =Physical acquisition= Physical acquisition implies a bit-for-bit copy of an entire physical store (e.g. flash memory); therefore, it is the method most similar to the examination of a personal computer. A physical acquisition has the advantage of allowing deleted files and data remnants to be examined. Physical extraction acquires information from the device by direct access to the flash memories. Generally this is harder to achieve because the device original equipment manufacturer needs to secure against arbitrary reading of memory; therefore, a device may be locked to a certain operator. To get around this security, mobile forensics tool vendors often develop their own boot loaders, enabling the forensic tool to access the memory (and often, also to bypass user passcodes or pattern locks). Generally the physical extraction is split into two steps, the dumping phase and the decoding phase. =Brute force acquisition= Brute force acquisition can be performed by 3rd party passcode brute force tools that send a series of passcodes / passwords to the mobile device. This is a time-consuming method, but effective nonetheless. This technique uses trial and error in an attempt to create the correct combination of password or PIN to authenticate access to the mobile device. Despite the process taking an extensive amount of time, it is still one of the best methods to employ if the forensic professional is unable to obtain the passcode. With current available software and hardware it has become quite easy to break the encryption on a mobile devices password file to obtain the passcode. Two manufacturers have become public since the release of the iPhone5, Cellebrite and GrayShift. These manufacturers are intended for law enforcement agencies and police departments. The Cellebrite UFED Ultimate unit costs over $40,000 US dollars and Grashifts system costs $15,000. Brute forcing tools are connected to the device and will physically send codes on iOS devices starting from 0000 to 9999 in sequence until the correct code is successfully entered. Once the code entry has been successful, full access to the device is given and data extraction can commence.  Tools  Early investigations consisted of live manual analysis of mobile devices; with examiners photographing or writing down useful material for use as evidence. Without forensic photography equipment such as Fernico ZRT, EDEC Eclipse, or Project-a-Phone, this had the disadvantage of risking the modification of the device content, as well as leaving many parts of the proprietary operating system inaccessible. In recent years a number of hardware/software tools have emerged to recover logical and physical evidence from mobile devices. Most tools consist of both hardware and software portions. The hardware includes a number of cables to connect the mobile device to the acquisition machine; the software exists to extract the evidence and, occasionally even to analyse it. Most recently, mobile device forensic tools have been developed for the field. This is in response both to military units' demand for fast and accurate anti- terrorism intelligence, and to law enforcement demand for forensic previewing capabilities at a crime scene, search warrant execution, or exigent circumstances. Such mobile forensic tools are often ruggedized for harsh environments (e.g. the battlefield) and rough treatment (e.g. being dropped or submerged in water). Generally, because it is impossible for any one tool to capture all evidence from all mobile devices, mobile forensic professionals recommend that examiners establish entire toolkits consisting of a mix of commercial, open source, broad support, and narrow support forensic tools, together with accessories such as battery chargers, Faraday bags or other signal disruption equipment, and so forth. =Commercial forensic tools= Some current tools include Belkasoft Evidence Center, Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensic Detective, Elcomsoft Mobile Forensic Bundle, Susteen Secure View, MOBILEdit Forensic Express and Micro Systemation XRY. Some tools have additionally been developed to address increasing criminal usage of phones manufactured with Chinese chipsets, which include MediaTek (MTK), Spreadtrum and MStar. Such tools include Cellebrite's CHINEX, and XRY PinPoint. =Open source= Most open source mobile forensics tools are platform-specific and geared toward smartphone analysis. Though not originally designed to be a forensics tool, BitPim has been widely used on CDMA phones as well as LG VX4400/VX6000 and many Sanyo Sprint cell phones. =Physical tools=Forensic desoldering Commonly referred to as a \\"Chip-Off\\" technique within the industry, the last and most intrusive method to get a memory image is to desolder the non-volatile memory chip and connect it to a memory chip reader. This method contains the potential danger of total data destruction: it is possible to destroy the chip and its content because of the heat required during desoldering. Before the invention of the BGA technology it was possible to attach probes to the pins of the memory chip and to recover the memory through these probes. The BGA technique bonds the chips directly onto the PCB through molten solder balls, such that it is no longer possible to attach probes. Here you can see that moisture in the circuit board turned to steam when it was subjected to intense heat. This produces the so-called \\"popcorn effect.\\" Desoldering the chips is done carefully and slowly, so that the heat does not destroy the chip or data. Before the chip is desoldered the PCB is baked in an oven to eliminate remaining water. This prevents the so- called popcorn effect, at which the remaining water would blow the chip package at desoldering. There are mainly three methods to melt the solder: hot air, infrared light, and steam-phasing. The infrared light technology works with a focused infrared light beam onto a specific integrated circuit and is used for small chips. The hot air and steam methods cannot focus as much as the infrared technique. =Chip re-balling= After desoldering the chip a re-balling process cleans the chip and adds new tin balls to the chip. Re- balling can be done in two different ways. * The first is to use a stencil. The stencil is chip-dependent and must fit exactly. Then the tin-solder is put on the stencil. After cooling the tin the stencil is removed and if necessary a second cleaning step is done. * The second method is laser re- balling.Homepage of FactronixVideo: Re-balling process Here the stencil is programmed into the re-balling unit. A bondhead (looks like a tube/needle) is automatically loaded with one tin ball from a solder ball singulation tank. The ball is then heated by a laser, such that the tin-solder ball becomes fluid and flows onto the cleaned chip. Instantly after melting the ball the laser turns off and a new ball falls into the bondhead. While reloading the bondhead of the re-balling unit changes the position to the next pin. A third method makes the entire re-balling process unnecessary. The chip is connected to an adapter with Y-shaped springs or spring-loaded pogo pins. The Y-shaped springs need to have a ball onto the pin to establish an electric connection, but the pogo pins can be used directly on the pads on the chip without the balls. The advantage of forensic desoldering is that the device does not need to be functional and that a copy without any changes to the original data can be made. The disadvantage is that the re-balling devices are expensive, so this process is very costly and there are some risks of total data loss. Hence, forensic desoldering should only be done by experienced laboratories. JTAG Existing standardized interfaces for reading data are built into several mobile devices, e.g., to get position data from GPS equipment (NMEA) or to get deceleration information from airbag units. Not all mobile devices provide such a standardized interface nor does there exist a standard interface for all mobile devices, but all manufacturers have one problem in common. The miniaturizing of device parts opens the question how to automatically test the functionality and quality of the soldered integrated components. For this problem an industry group, the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG), developed a test technology called boundary scan. Despite the standardization there are four tasks before the JTAG device interface can be used to recover the memory. To find the correct bits in the boundary scan register one must know which processor and memory circuits are used and how they are connected to the system bus. When not accessible from outside one must find the test points for the JTAG interface on the printed circuit board and determine which test point is used for which signal. The JTAG port is not always soldered with connectors, such that it is sometimes necessary to open the device and re-solder the access port. The protocol for reading the memory must be known and finally the correct voltage must be determined to prevent damage to the circuit. The boundary scan produces a complete forensic image of the volatile and non-volatile memory. The risk of data change is minimized and the memory chip doesn't have to be desoldered. Generating the image can be slow and not all mobile devices are JTAG enabled. Also, it can be difficult to find the test access port.Ronald van der Knijff. (2007). retrieved from 10 Good Reasons Why You Should Shift Focus to Small Scale Digital Device Forensics . =Command line tools=System commands Mobile devices do not provide the possibility to run or boot from a CD, connecting to a network share or another device with clean tools. Therefore, system commands could be the only way to save the volatile memory of a mobile device. With the risk of modified system commands it must be estimated if the volatile memory is really important. A similar problem arises when no network connection is available and no secondary memory can be connected to a mobile device because the volatile memory image must be saved on the internal non-volatile memory, where the user data is stored and most likely deleted important data will be lost. System commands are the cheapest method, but imply some risks of data loss. Every command usage with options and output must be documented. AT commands AT commands are old modem commands, e.g., Hayes command set and Motorola phone AT commands, and can therefore only be used on a device that has modem support. Using these commands one can only obtain information through the operating system, such that no deleted data can be extracted. dd For external memory and the USB flash drive, appropriate software, e.g., the Unix command dd, is needed to make the bit-level copy. Furthermore, USB flash drives with memory protection do not need special hardware and can be connected to any computer. Many USB drives and memory cards have a write- lock switch that can be used to prevent data changes, while making a copy. If the USB drive has no protection switch, a blocker can be used to mount the drive in a read-only mode or, in an exceptional case, the memory chip can be desoldered. The SIM and memory cards need a card reader to make the copy. The SIM card is soundly analyzed, such that it is possible to recover (deleted) data like contacts or text messages. The Android operating system includes the dd command. In a blog post on Android forensic techniques, a method to live image an Android device using the dd command is demonstrated. =Non-forensic commercial tools=Flasher tools A flasher tool is programming hardware and/or software that can be used to program (flash) the device memory, e.g., EEPROM or flash memory. These tools mainly originate from the manufacturer or service centers for debugging, repair, or upgrade services. They can overwrite the non-volatile memory and some, depending on the manufacturer or device, can also read the memory to make a copy, originally intended as a backup. The memory can be protected from reading, e.g., by software command or destruction of fuses in the read circuit.Tom Salt and Rodney Drake. US Patent 5469557. (1995). Retrieved from Code protection in microcontroller with EEPROM fuses. Note, this would not prevent writing or using the memory internally by the CPU. The flasher tools are easy to connect and use, but some can change the data and have other dangerous options or do not make a complete copy.Marcel Breeuwsma, Martien de Jongh, Coert Klaver, Ronald van der Knijff, and Mark Roeloffs. (2007). retrieved from Forensic Data Recovery from Flash Memory . Small l Scale Digital Device Forensics Journal, Volume 1 (Number 1). Also, many of these tools have become more adept at recovering user passcodes/passwords, without user data loss. An example of a tool commonly used for this area is a BST Dongle .  Controversies  In general there exists no standard for what constitutes a supported device in a specific product. This has led to the situation where different vendors define a supported device differently. A situation such as this makes it much harder to compare products based on vendor provided lists of supported devices. For instance a device where logical extraction using one product only produces a list of calls made by the device may be listed as supported by that vendor while another vendor can produce much more information. Furthermore, different products extract different amounts of information from different devices. This leads to a very complex landscape when trying to overview the products. In general this leads to a situation where testing a product extensively before purchase is strongly recommended. It is quite common to use at least two products which complement each other. Mobile phone technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Digital forensics relating to mobile devices seems to be at a stand still or evolving slowly. For mobile phone forensics to catch up with release cycles of mobile phones, more comprehensive and in depth framework for evaluating mobile forensic toolkits should be developed and data on appropriate tools and techniques for each type of phone should be made available a timely manner.  Anti-forensics  Anti-computer forensics is more difficult because of the small size of the devices and the user's restricted data accessibility. Nevertheless, there are developments to secure the memory in hardware with security circuits in the CPU and memory chip, such that the memory chip cannot be read even after desoldering.Secure Boot PatentHarini Sundaresan.

It remained unfinished due to the political culture of the July Monarchy in the 1830s and Stendhal's fears of losing his government position by offending the administration. It was published posthumously in 1894. Background and composition Stendhal wrote Lucien Leuwen while serving as consul for Louis-Philippe in Civitavecchia. \\"I‚Äôm making the first draft too long,\\" Stendhal wrote about Lucien Leuwen in his journal. \\"In Marseilles, in 1828 I think, I made the manuscript of the Rouge too short.

Make the style clearer still and more flowing, less abrupt.\\" Stendhal wound up only revising the first part. The July Monarchy lasted until the French Revolution of 1848, six years after Stendhal‚Äôs death, and Stendhal could not afford to risk his official post in Civitavecchia. The novel as we have it consists of the original draft of the first two parts. Plot The book describes the career of Lucien, the son of a Parisian banker, in the years following the July Revolution of 1830 that brought Louis Philippe I to the throne. Lucien is expelled from the √âcole Polytechnique after taking part in an anti-government demonstration following the funeral of General Lamarque. After two years of idleness he joins the army, and falls off a horse as his regiment enters the city of Nancy because he is gazing at ‚Äòa young blonde with magnificent hair and a disdainful look‚Äô. He falls in love with this young widow, who is named Mme de Chasteller, although he is forced to renounce her. Lucien then returns to Paris and becomes principal private secretary to the Minister of the Interior. Stendhal planned a last section that would show Lucien in Italy and resolve the story with a happy reunion with Mme de Chasteller, but it was never written.

The village is just north of the A44 road between Woodstock and Chipping Norton. Manor The toponym is Old English, recorded in the Domesday Book in AD 1086 as Chidintone, meaning \\"estate of a man named Cydda\\". Historically Cuddington has been an alternative form. It has also been known as Nether Kiddington to distinguish it from the hamlet of Over Kiddington south of the village. 17th century dovecote in the grounds of Kiddington Hall Offa of Mercia gave Kiddington, with Heythrop, to Worcester Priory in about 780. After the Norman conquest of England the manor was held successively by the De Salcey, Willescote or Williamscote, Babington, Browne and Browne-Mostyn families. After the English Reformation the Browne family were recusants with their own Roman Catholic chapel and priest, and they ensured the survival of Catholicism in this part of Oxfordshire. Kiddington Hall was built in 1673, and in the 18th century \\"Capability\\" Brown laid out the gardens. In 1850 the architect Charles Barry rebuilt the house so completely that no external trace of the original building is visible, added a new stable block and remodelled the gardens. In 1950 Lawrence Robson, founder of accountancy company Robson Rhodes, bought Kiddington Hall, and on his death in 1982 his son Maurice Robson inherited the house. In September 2009 Maurice placed Kiddington Estate (including Kiddington Hall) on the market for ¬£42 million, his divorce seemingly being the reason for the sale. Jemima Khan bought the property in Autumn 2010 for a reported ¬£15 million. Parish church apsidal chancel designed by G.G. Scott. The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was Norman, and the original chancel arch survives from this time. The rest of the church was rebuilt about 1400 in the Decorated Gothic style. The chancel was extended westwards so that, unusually amongst parish churches, it has one chancel arch in front of another. The rest of the 14th century rebuilding comprises the nave, a south chapel, south porch and west tower. Later in the Middle Ages a Perpendicular Gothic east window was inserted in the chancel. In 1845 the chancel was rebuilt in its present apsidal form on the original Norman foundations to designs by George Gilbert Scott. In 1848 the Perpendicular Gothic east window was removed and re-used to form sedilia. In 1879 a vestry and organ chamber were added. The tower has three bells. James Keene of Woodstock cast the tenor bell in 1629. Mears & Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1875. The date and founder of the middle bell are unknown. There is also a smaller bell, now disused, that may have been cast by John Mitchell of Wokingham in about 1493. In 1771 the poet and literary historian Rev. Thomas Warton was appointed rector of St. Nicholas' church. In 1781 he wrote The History and Antiquities of Kiddington, and in 1785 he was made Poet Laureate. Warton remained both rector and Poet Laureate until his death in 1790. St. Nicholas' is now combined in one benefice with the parishes of Wootton and Glympton. School Kiddington Kindergarten, formerly the parish school Kiddington parish school was built in 1856. It is now a private kindergarten.

In Ireland at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century, the fortified house (), along with the stronghouse, developed as a replacement for the tower house. 'Fortified Houses' were often rectangular, or sometimes U or L-shaped, three-storey structures with high gables and chimney stacks and large windows with hood mouldings. Some examples have square towers at the corners. The interiors were relatively spacious with wooden partitions and numerous fireplaces. In a number of cases 'Fortified Houses' were built onto pre- existing tower houses. 'Fortified Houses' were protected by gun fire from the angle towers and bartizans, and were also provided with bawn walls with gunloops, towers and protected gateways. 'Fortified Houses' were built throughout Ireland by large landowners from a variety of backgrounds, such as the Old English Earl of Clanricarde who built Portumna Castle in County Galway; Gaelic lords such as MacDonogh MacCarthy, Lord of Duhallow, who built Kanturk Castle in County Cork; and Cromwellian soldiers such as Sir Charles Coote, who built Rush Hall in County Offaly.

Generally fortifications added. United States In the United States, historically a fortified house was often called a fort or station depending on the region. This was a building built for defense against primarily Indian attacks in frontier areas. While some fortified houses were sometimes used by militias, state and federal military units, their primary purpose was for private or civilian defense. Sometimes a stockade would surround the building(s).

H√§fker published essential contributions to film theory. Like Sergei Eisenstein he saw film as a comprehensive artwork. H√§fker is considered the most important representative of the film reform movement in Germany. He recognized early the cultural potential of cinema, but also the dangers of \\"low taste\\" resulting from commercial film production. His work can be seen as part of the aesthetic movement initiated by Deutscher Werkbund and D√ºrerbund. During his years in Dresden he was closely connected to Ferdinand Avenarius and his D√ºrerbund. He wrote popular books on history, sexual education and science. His presumably most successful book, Das Sternbilder-Buch, contributed to educating the youth to love of stars and astronomy. H√§fker created it in collaboration with graphic designer Kurt Fiedler for the D√ºrerbund. H√§fker's Weltgeschichte in einem Band (World History in one Volume) was banned by the Nazis. Because of his resistance against Nazi culture policy, they imposed Berufsverbot on H√§fker.

He is also a record producer, and DJ under the stage name Joshua Ryan. Topolsky was the co-founder and editor-in-chief of technology news network The Verge, and a co-creator of its parent company Vox Media. Previously, he was the editor-in-chief of Engadget. On August 4, 2014, Topolsky stepped down from The Verge and Vox Media to join Bloomberg \\"as the editor of a series of new online ventures it is introducing as part of a revamped journalism strategy\\". He left Bloomberg in July 2015 after clashes with Michael Bloomberg over the direction of its digital media strategy and started the digital news company The Outline. Journalism Between August 2008 and March 2011, Topolsky was the editor-in-chief of the technology blog Engadget. Since 2009, he has been the technology correspondent for NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and then The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In March 2011, he resigned his position at Engadget. Following his departure from Engadget, Topolsky began a new site called This Is My Next, a temporary home for him and his ex-Engadget colleagues as they built a new technology network. Like Engadget, the website included a wide variety of technology news, reviews, and editorials. The website name is a play on a phrase Topolsky often says when reviewing a device that he especially likes (e.g. \\"This is my next phone.\\"). Topolsky's team at This Is My Next included former Engadget editors and contributors including Paul Miller, Nilay Patel, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, and others. On July 18, 2011, Topolsky announced on Late Night that he and his team were developing a new permanent network called The Verge. The Verge launched on November 1, 2011, with Topolsky as the founding editor-in- chief. He appears in many of the audio and video podcasts that the site releases as well as writing articles. He has appeared on Fallon's shows several times since the announcement of the site with products the site has reviewed that he showcases to the audience. The New York Times reported on July 24, 2014 that Topolsky would be leaving The Verge on August 4, 2014 to pursue an editorial position at Bloomberg. The Times noted, \\"He will develop and run Bloomberg‚Äôs new ventures, which will cover specific topic areas such as politics and luxury.\\" The New York Times reported on July 10, 2015 that Topolsky would be leaving Bloomberg Business after clashes with founder Michael Bloomberg. This follows a radical redesign of Bloomberg Business web properties. In April 2015, Topolsky started Tomorrow, a weekly podcast about current trends in technology, news, and culture. Each episode of Tomorrow features cohost Ryan Houlihan and a special guest, ranging from Google designer Mat√≠as Duarte to Topolsky's own wife. In 2016, Topolsky pursued initial funding for a new digital media outlet. The company is titled Independent Media and launched its first publication, The Outline, on December 5. Music Under the stage name Joshua Ryan, Topolsky was a well known trance music DJ whose tracks were included on several gold certified compilation albums. His tracks have been licensed by Palm Pictures, Moonshine Music, Ministry of Sound, and Sony Music Entertainment (UK). In 1999, Fragrant Records released his single \\"Pistolwhip\\", which was re-released on NuLife Recordings in 2001 and reached number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. Topolsky and his brother Eric Emm are known as the producing duo The Brothers. Personal life Topolsky lives outside New York with his wife, Laura June, who was also an editor at The Verge and now writes for various publications such as The Awl and Jezebel, and their daughter, Zelda June Topolsky. Topolsky was raised in a Jewish family.

Career Pamela Stanley was born in Nether Alderley, Cheshire. She was the daughter of Sir Arthur Lyulph Stanley, the fifth Baron Stanley of Alderley and his wife Margaret Evans-Gordon, the daughter of Henry Evans-Gordon.Cham, p. 48.Mitford, p. 365. She spent her early childhood in Australia, where her father was Governor of Victoria between 1914 - 1919.Cham, p. 48. She was educated in France and Switzerland, later studying at the Webber Douglas School of Acting and Singing.Chapman, p. 88 Her mother was a noted amateur actress, descended from the Kemble family of actors.Elliot, p.264-5 She made her stage d√©but in Derby Day in 1932 at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith.Parker, p. 1321 This was followed by six months at the Oxford Repertory Company in which she appeared as Mrs. Marwood in The Way of the World.Chapman, p. 88 She appeared with Martin Harvey in Leopold David Lewis' The Bells (1933) at the Savoy Theatre, and also as Wendy in Peter Pan in 1934. In the same year she acted in two productions by Sir Robert Atkins at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, where she played Titania in A Midsummer Night's Dream with Phyllis Neilson-Terry, Leslie French, and Greer Garson as an uncredited extra; in The Tempest she was Miranda to John Drinkwater's Prospero, with Leslie French as Ariel and Atkins as Caliban.Troyan, p. 375Dymkowski, p. 375 Pamela Stanley appeared as Queen Victoria in Victoria Regina by Laurence Housman at the Gate Theatre in 1935,Low, p. 233 and in 1936 she played Ophelia in Hamlet on Broadway with Leslie Howard. However, John Gielgud had just ended a very successful Broadway run of the same play; the critics were not impressed and the show closed after 39 performances.Croall, p. 98 She was cast as Queen Victoria in the 1936 film David Livingstone before returning to the Lyric for another season in Victoria Regina (1937‚Äì1938). The noted theatre critic James Agate compared Stanley's performance with a New York production starring Helen Hayes; unfortunately he found Hayes' portrayal of Queen Victoria like \\"a blazing sun, and I am so blinded by the dazzling performance of Helen Hayes that I literally cannot see Pamela Stanley.\\" Nevertheless, he found the audience very appreciative: \\"All around me on the first night the air hummed with pretty comments, and blasts of Isn't she sweet? blew down my neck.\\" But he thought that Stanley had \\"moments of real emotion which, being genuinely her own, genuinely move her audience.\\"Agate, p. 10 Contemporary photographs show that her resemblance to the queen was remarkable. She appeared yet again as Victoria in the 1938 film Marigold.Low, p. 233Low, p. 354 Family life Pamela Stanley married Sir David Cunynghame (eleventh baronet) in 1941, becoming Lady Cunynghame. They had three sons, Andrew, John and Arthur; Andrew succeeded his father as the twelfth baronet in 1978.Kidd, David Cunynghame was a film production manager, and amongst other films he worked on: Things to Come with Ralph Richardson; three films starring Robert Donat (The Private Life of Henry VIII, The Ghost Goes West and Knight Without Armour with Marlene Dietrich); and two films by Michael Powell, The Lion Has Wings and The Thief of Bagdad. Later career Pamela made a brief return to the stage in 1968 when she appeared for the last time as Queen Victoria in The Queen‚Äôs Highland Servant by William Douglas-Home at the Savoy Theatre in London.Stage (1969), p. 88 According to the author's memoirs, this was his favourite play.Douglas-Home, p. 122 She made a final appearance in a small, uncredited part in The Last Hand Grenade as the Governor's Wife. The film, directed by Gordon Flemyng starred Stanley Baker, Honor Blackman and Richard Attenborough.AFIC, p. 597 Pamela survived her husband (as the Dowager Lady Cunynghame) and died on 30 June 1991 aged eighty-one. Family tree Her grandmother May in the early 1870s (Frederic Leighton, 1870s) Her grandmother (Mrs. Henry Evans-Gordon) was born Mary Theodosia (May) Sartoris, and was painted several times by Frederic Leighton. May Sartoris' father Edward John Sartoris was Leighton's patron. Her brother married Nellie Grant, the daughter of Ulysses S. Grant. May's mother was the opera singer Adelaide Kemble (whose cousin, Gertrude Kemble, married Charles Santley); her aunt was Fanny Kemble and her great-aunt was Sarah Siddons.National Review, p. 170Parker, p. 1534 Pamela Stanley's aunt (her father's sister) was Venetia Stanley who was the recipient of a great many letters from the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. The Barons Stanley of Alderley and the Earls of Derby (the Stanleys of Bickerstaffe) are descended from Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley. The Derby Stakes were named after the 12th Earl of Derby, Edward Smith-Stanley, thus giving rise to the play in which Pamela Stanley made her stage d√©but.

As was common with other New Kingdom rulers, the epigraph makes claim to a divine legitimisation of kingship. Location and description The Dream Stele is a rectangular stele made of granite, tall and weighing 15 tons. It originally formed the back wall of a small open-air chapel built by Thutmose IV between the paws of the Sphinx. It was rediscovered in 1818 during Giovanni Battista Caviglia's clearance of the Sphinx. The stele itself is a reused door lintel from the entry to the mortuary temple of Khafre as pivot sockets on the back of the stele match those at the threshold of the temple. The scene in the lunette shows Thutmose IV on the left and right making offerings and libations to the Sphinx, which sits on a high pedestal with a door at the base. This is likely an artistic device used to raise the Sphinx above the head and shoulders of the king but it has contributed to the idea that a temple or passageway exists beneath the Sphinx. Text The text is fragmented, with a large asymmetrical crack beginning at the twelfth line and resulting in only partial preservation of the following two lines. The stele is preserved to a height of approximately on the left edge and on the right. Given its restored height was some , approximately half of the text is now missing. The preserved text runs as follows: > Year I, third month of the first season, day 19, under the Majesty of Horus, > the Mighty Bull, begetting radiance, (the Favourite) of the Two Goddesses, > enduring in Kingship like Atum, the Golden Horus, Mighty of Sword, repelling > the Nine Bows; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Men-kheperu-Ra, the Son of > Ra, Thothmes IV, Shining in Diadems; beloved of (Amon), given life, > stability and dominion, like Ra, for ever. Live the Good God, the Son of > Atum, Protector of Hor-akhty, Living Image of the All-Lord Sovereign, > Begotten of Ra, Excellent Heir of Kheperi, beautiful of face like his > father, who came forth equipped with the form of Horus upon him, a King > who... favour with the Ennead of the Gods; who purifies Heliopolis, who > satisfies Ra; who beautifies Memphis, who presents Truth to Atum, who offers > it to Him who is South of his Wall (Ptah), who makes a monument by daily > offering to the God who created all things, seeking benefits for the Gods of > the South and the North, who builds their houses of limestone, who endows > all their offerings, Son of Atum of His Body, Thothmes IV, Shining in > Diadems like Ra, Heir of Horus upon His Throne, Men-kheperu-Ra, given life. > When His Majesty was a stripling, like Horus, the Youth in Khemmis, his > beauty was like the Protector of His Father, he seemed like the God himself. > The army rejoiced because of love for him, and he repeated the circuit of > his might like the Son of Nut and all the princes and all the great ones... > Behold, he did a thing which gave him pleasure upon the highlands of the > Memphite Nome, upon its southern and northern road shooting at a target with > copper bolts, hunting lions and the small game of the desert, coursing in > his chariot, his horses being swifter than the wind, together with two of > his followers, while not a soul knew it. Now, when his hour came for giving > rest to his followers, it was always at the Setepet (Sanctuary of Hor-em- > akhet), beside Seker in Rostaw, Rennutet in Iat-Ta-Mut(?)... in the desert > (or necropolis), Mut of the Southern... (Neit?), Mistress of the Southern > Wall.

The quarters of > Memphis, and all the cities which are by him come to him, raising their > hands for him in praise to his face, bearing oblations for his Ka. One of > those days it came to pass that the King's Son Thothmes came, coursing at > the time of mid-day, and he rested in the shadow of this Great God. Sleep > seized him at the hour when the sun was in its zenith, and he found the > Majesty of this Revered God speaking with his own mouth, as a father speaks > with his son, saying: 'Behold thou me, my son, Thothmes. I am thy father, > Hor-em-akhet-Kheperi-Ra-Atum; I will give to thee my Kingdom upon earth at > the head of the living. Thou shalt wear the White Crown and the Red Crown > upon the Throne of Geb, the Hereditary Prince. The land shall be thine, in > its length and in its breath, that which the eye of the All-Lord shines > upon. The food of the Two Lands shall be thine, the great tribute of all > countries, the duration of a long period of years. My face is directed to > you, my heart is to you; Thou shalt be to me the protector of my affairs, > because I am ailing in all my limbs. The sands of the Sanctuary, upon which > I am, have reached me; turn to me in order to do what I desire. I know that > thou art my son, my protector; behold; I am with thee, I am thy leader.' > When he finished this speech, the King's Son awoke, hearing this..., he > understood the words of the God, and he put them in his heart. He said: > 'Come, let us hasten to our houses in the city; they shall protect the > oblations for this God which we bring for him (or that we shall protect... > and that we may bring): oxen... and all young vegetables; and we shall give > praise to Wennefer... Khafra, the statue made for Atum-Hor-em-akhet...' The rest of the text likely gave Thutmose's response and an affirmation of the works carried out. Interpretations of the text Dream Stele (detail of lunette); reproduction at Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, San Jose. The Sphinx (Hor-em-akhet) promising to make Thutmose ruler of Egypt if he clears the sand that has engulfed the god has been interpreted as indicating that Thutmose IV was not the crown prince (if he was, he would have ascended the throne on his father's death anyway), and that he may instead have seized the throne from his older brothers, with the erection of the stele serving solely to legitimize his rule. This interpretation is based on the find of three finely carved stele (now lost) which depict other sons of Amenhotep II making offerings to the Sphinx; the names of these princes have been carefully erased. Selim Hassan's publication of the stelae (partially composed by Dorothy Eady) was the first to propose this interpretation: > We may suppose then, that these elder brothers stood in the way of his > ambitions, and that Thothmes removed them in some way, either by death or > disgrace, and then obliterated their names, in order that their very > memories might be forgotten... I am afraid that this theory does not present > Thothmes IV in a very favourable light, and if he was not actually a > wholesale murderer (and there seems to be grounds for supposing that he > was), at least he was a cold-hearted egoist. This characterisation of Thutmose as a ruthless usurper is still influential. However, the divine determination and birth of kings is a common 18th Dynasty motif and was utilised by rulers such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, and Thutmose's father Amenhotep II on his own Sphinx Stele. We can never be sure of the circumstances surrounding Thutmose's ascension, the text of the stele cannot be used as an indicator of his legitimacy. = Medical analysis of the text= In 2012, Dr Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, hypothesized that early deaths of Thutmose IV and other Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs, including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, were likely a result of familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.

In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (\\"hole cards\\"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the \\"board\\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s. In home games, it is typical to use antes, while casinos typically use only blinds for these games. No limit and fixed limit games are most common, while spread limit and pot limit games are less common. The betting format and stakes can vary by region as well as time of year and volume (casinos often change games on weekends to accommodate increased customer demand). Later betting rounds often have a higher limit than earlier betting rounds. Each betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left (when blinds are used, the first round begins with the player after the big blind), so community card games are generally positional games. Most community card games do not play well with lowball hand values, though some do play very well at high-low split, especially with ace-to-five low values, making it possible to win both halves of a pot. When played high-low split, there is generally a minimum qualifying hand for low (often 8-high) and no declaration is needed. Community cards The main difference from draw and stud poker are the community cards. Often, several community cards are dealt to the table, shared by all players, and subject to variant-specific rules about how many, and which of the cards may be used in each player's hand. Such a set of community cards is often called a \\"board\\" or \\"window\\" (though this latter term is inconsistent with its use in other card games). The board is usually dealt in a simple line, but some games may have elaborate layouts of community cards with special rules about what combinations can be used. For example, Texas hold 'em ends with each player holding two cards in his individual hand, and a board of five community cards in a simple line shared by everyone; each player then plays the best five-card hand in any combination. In Omaha hold 'em, game rules restrict players to using exactly three (no more and no fewer) of the five community cards, combined with exactly two of the four cards dealt to each player, to make a hand. In Tic-tac-toe, the board is a 3x3 array of nine cards, and players must use exactly three cards from a row, column, or diagonal of the board. Texas hold 'em This is the most popular community card game today. Each player is dealt two private \\"hole\\" cards, after which there is a betting round. Then three community cards are dealt face up (in no particular order or pattern) to form the \\"flop\\", followed by a second betting round. A fourth community card (the \\"turn\\") is followed by a third betting round. And finally the fifth community card (the \\"river\\") is followed by the final betting round. At showdown, each player plays the best five-card hand he can make using any five cards among the two in his hand and the five on the board. This is the key difference from Omaha hold 'em; the player may use both, one, or none of his hole cards in the final hand (though a hand that plays the board is guaranteed to be able to \\"chop\\" the pot at best, since every other player still in the hand at showdown has access to those same five cards). Note that in current practice, before each community card round (the flop, the turn, and the river) first a card is \\"burned\\" and placed in a discard pile. This was implemented to prevent card-cheaters from \\"marking\\" cards and knowing what the card on the top of the dealer's deck was. =Double-board hold 'em= For double-board hold 'em, two separate five-card boards are dealt, and the high hand using each board takes half of the pot. For example, after the first betting round, three community cards are dealt to each of two separate boards; after the second round, another community card is dealt to each board; and before the final round, a fifth community card is dealt to each board (so there will be in total ten community cards, comprising two separate five-card hold 'em boards). It is possible for one player to have the best hand on both boards and thus \\"scoop\\" the entire pot. This variant of Texas hold 'em is sometimes called \\"double-flop hold 'em\\", which is a bit of a misnomer, since there are not just two flops, but also two turns and two rivers. =Greek hold 'em= Greek hold 'em follows the same rules as Omaha, except that each player is only dealt two cards, same as in Texas hold 'em. In Greek hold 'em each player must use both hole cards along with 3 of the total available community cards to make the strongest five card hand, unlike Texas hold 'em where each player may play the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards available to them. =Irish Poker= In Irish poker, each player is dealt four cards before the flop. After the betting round on the flop is completed each player must discard two cards. From this point the game is played exactly like Texas hold 'em with betting after the turn and river. At showdown, each player uses their remaining two cards along with the board to construct a hand. =No river hold 'em= Players are dealt three hole cards instead of two with three betting rounds: pre-flop, flop and turn. Players can use any number of hole cards to make the final hand. =Royal hold 'em= Royal hold 'em is a variation which is played using a stripped deck. In royal hold'em, the deuces through nines are stripped from the deck, thereby only leaving the tens through aces. Royal hold 'em can only be played with a maximum of six players because there are only 20 cards in the deck. With 5 community cards, 3 burn cards, and 2 pocket cards per player, a six-player table will use all 20 cards in the deck. The strategy for royal hold 'em varies from other forms of poker, since the odds of certain hands are greatly increased. =Six-plus hold 'em= Six-plus hold 'em, also known as short-deck hold 'em, is a variation in which the cards valued 2 through 5 are removed from the deck. Omaha hold 'em Another hold 'em variant is Omaha hold 'em. Each player is dealt four cards to his private hand instead of two. The betting rounds and layout of community cards is identical to Texas hold 'em. At showdown, each player's hand is the best five-card hand he can make from exactly three of the five cards on the board, plus exactly two of his own cards. The high-low split version of Omaha is called many different names, such as \\"Omaha Eight or better\\", \\"Omaha HiLo\\" or \\"Omaha8\\". Each player, using the above rules, makes a separate five-card high hand and five-card low hand, and the pot is split between the high and low (which may be the same player). To qualify for low, a player must be able to play an 8-7-6-5-4 or lower. A few casinos play with a 9-low qualifier instead, but this is rare. In high-low split games, aces count as both high and low. The low hand is unavailable if the board cards do not include cards of at least three different ranks of 8 or lower (with aces counting as low). Paired cards lower than eight don't qualify. When high hands only are used, the game is generally called \\"Omaha high\\" to avoid ambiguity. Omaha can be played fixed limit, pot limit (where it is often called \\"PLO\\") or no limit. It is sometimes played where each player gets five cards instead of four. The same rules apply for showdown: each player must use two of his cards with three of the community cards. = Courchevel = A variant of Omaha hold 'em (5-Card Omaha) very popular in Europe, where instead of betting on the initial four cards and then flopping three community cards for the second round, the first community card is dealt before the first betting round, so that each player has five private cards and a single community card on his first round of betting. Then two more community cards are dealt to complete the Flop, and then play proceeds exactly as in Omaha. Pineapple variations Pineapple hold 'em exists halfway between Texas hold 'em and Omaha hold 'em and has been very popular in Australia and South America, specifically in Medellin, Colombia, where it was first introduced in a private poker room since 2010. Players are initially dealt three cards. Each player then discards one of the three cards (Pre-flop, Post- flop or at Showdown), and the game proceeds exactly as in Texas hold 'em.Pineapple hold 'em Mind Sports Olympiad webpage on Pineapple Hold'em, retrieved 13 July 2012 In some regional variations, five cards are dealt, and one is discarded after flop, turn, and river, otherwise proceeding as usual Texas hold 'em. =Pineapple= Players discard their third (unwanted or unneeded) card pre-flop, before the first betting round. =Crazy Pineapple= Players discard their third (unwanted or unneeded) card after the flop, before the fourth community card is dealt. =Tahoe (Lazy Pineapple)= Players discard after the final betting round or at showdown so they may not use all three of them to make a hand. Each player may use none, one, or two cards from his hand (never three cards) combined with those on the board, to make his final five-card hand, just like in Texas hold 'em. In the variant known as \\"Super hold 'em\\", players can keep all 3 private cards throughout the play and may use all three cards to determine high hand. Manila Manila is played with a Stripped deck in which all cards below the rank of 7 are removed (leaving 32 cards). Each player is dealt two private cards, and a single community card is dealt face up, followed by the first betting round. Then a second community card is followed by a second betting round, a third community card and a third betting round, a fourth community card and a fourth betting round, and finally a fifth community card and fifth betting round. On showdown, unlike Texas hold 'em (and more like Omaha), each player makes the best hand possible from both of their own hole cards with exactly three of the five community cards. Because of the stripped deck, a flush beats a full house. Also, an ace may not be played low for a straight (that is, the hand A-7-8-9-10 is not a straight in Manila). Manila and its variants are rarely played high-low split (in fact, very few stripped deck games are ever played low). Common variations involve dealing three cards to each player, one of which can either be discarded at some point (like Pineapple, above), or else held to the end, but maintaining the requirement that players play exactly two of their own cards with exactly three of the board. The three-card variant is sometimes played with 6s being restored to the deck, making it 36 cards. =Pinatubo= Because Manila has five betting rounds, it does not play well at no limit or pot limit. This can be easily modified by eliminating the betting round between the second and third community cards. So, each player is dealt two private cards and a single community card is dealt to the board, followed by the first betting round. Then two community cards are dealt, followed by a second betting round. Then a fourth community card and third betting round, a fifth and final community card and fourth betting round, followed by a showdown as above. The three-card variant can be played this way as well (as with Manila, the players must use exactly two of their three-hole cards with three of the board cards to make a hand).

His lifelong business partner was Hartley Staley. The subject matter of his paintings included: Maritime scenes, Landscapes, southern African American scenes. The style of his work was primitivist and his primary medium was oil. The primary area where he was active was Florida although he spent a good deal of time in Maine early in his career. Free access is available to the full cite each Friday. Family life Perkins was adopted by Joel and Martha Perkins and was raised in Castine, Maine. Biographers speculate that the military presence in Castine led Perkins to paint maritime scenes. When asked about where he learned to paint, Perkins replied, \\"I've always been painting, ever since I was a child. I guess I taught myself.\\" After painting for a few years, Perkins received formal training at the Portland School of Fine Arts in nearby Portland, Maine. Perkins first experimented with oil paint when seven years old after watching his father and Donald, his older brother, painting landscapes where they lived. Perkins spoke of his first painting: \\"My first painting was when I was seven and was of a four mast sailing ship, which I copied from a large painting. I used oils on that first painting and it was a horrible looking thing. I sold it to a woman vacationer at Castine for 25 cents and I felt rich.\\" At age eighteen, Perkins enlisted in the Navy. After two years of service, at age twenty, he enrolled in the Portland School of Fine Arts. There he studied under Alexander Bowers. Throughout his first two years of schooling, he supplemented his GI allowance by working at a fish factory in Portland and by lettering signs. Incarceration Perkins was incarcerated for one to five years for writing bad checks at the Reformatory for Men in South Windham, Maine. Perry Hayden, the superintendent at the reformatory, found Perkins to be a lonely boy that did not interact with others. Upon discovering his predilection for painting, he allowed him to paint. Perkins wished to paint something large and thus was allowed to paint the entry walls using common house paint and oils. The murals measured six feet tall and two feet wide and were connected into a single panoramic scene over the doorway. On the right side of the door is a forested lake and on the left is the Portland Head Light Station. On the opposing wall that faced the door he added a painting of the Great Seal of the State of Maine. Hartley Staley At age twenty-three, Perkins got to know Hartley Staley who lived in Bridgton, ME and was invited to stay in his home. Perkins was inspired by the vacation town and begin painting the surrounding area's landscapes. Staley helped Perkins to purchase a small piece of property to house Perkin's first studio to be called \\"The Red Shingle Gift Shop and Studio\\" on Route 302. A garage from another location was reassembled on their land and decorated with red stained shingles with 12 foot wings added onto each side to exhibit Perkin's paintings. During the following winter, Perkins created numerous small marine and landscape paintings which Staley framed. A few large paintings were also produced. Perkins also painted wooden cut outs of ducks and sea gulls which were then mounted on the frames of shore and marine paintings. The shop also included items created by Thomaston, Maine State Prison inmates. Staley's aunt, Dorothy Prescott provided embroidered and quilt items to supplement the store. Fire One October morning, fire broke out and destroyed hundreds of paintings. Firefighters at the scene were unable to provide water for their hoses due to the extreme cold. The loss of paintings was valued at around $15,000. Perkins and Staley opened a restaurant in Bridgton for a bit before both moved to Portland where they opened a new studio shop named Hartley's Antiques. At their new store, Perkins painted ships and Staley sold antiques. Their business was relocated to Windham on Route 302 in approximately 1980. In their new location, wings were available for Perkins to show his paintings. Florida Perkins moved to Saint Augustine, Florida where he established a studio shop located on Aviles Street which was subsequently relocated to San Marco.

Velddrif, which has incorporated the village of Laaiplek has the lowest crime statistics in South Africa. It comprises 100 hectares and has 3.5 km of waterways (see video). The marina is surrounded on three sides by the Great Berg River and is one kilometre from the harbour mouth where the river meets St. Helena Bay. This bay, the largest on the West Coast of Africa, offers the finest sailing conditions on the South African coastline due to its sheltered nature and orientation to the prevailing summer wind (South-east Trade, which blows off- shore). Vasco Da Gama landed here and a monument was erected on the shore by the Portuguese Government The marina is adjacent to the fishing harbour of Laaiplek and is surrounded by salt marsh. The area is renowned for its bird life as well over 350 different sea, land and river birds can be found here. Port Owen is named after H.Owen Wiggins Junior, who developed the marina and its residential plots. To achieve this he had to dredge approximately 1 million cubic metres of sand and rock over 15 years and construct 7 km of embankment as well as many jetties and other infrastructure. He also established the Port Owen Yacht Club (which grew from Friday evening sundowners on Gideon Langart's 36' yacht Absolutely!, and set aside the Marina Centre which has become the commercial centre of Port Owen. Harbour Centre, the shopping centre has a health spa, pub, restaurant, hairdressing salon, cafe and estate agency. Owen Wiggins went on to create the Langebaan Country Club. Port Owen was the first deep-sea, residential marina developed in South Africa. The waterways are controlled by the Port Owen Marina Authority. More Info For many years it was the home of Roamer, Bob Burn's boat on which he became the 32nd man to sail around the world single-handely. The bell of roameris on display at Gideon Estates. Port Owen is surrounded on three sides by the Great Berg River, which limits its future growth making sure it remains restful and exclusive. In the heart of Port Owen is Admiral Island, a privately-run security estate reachable only by the access-controlled bridge or from the water. The shoreline of Admiral Island is monitored by 24-hour- monitored security cameras and rapid response armed security. The lifestyle on Admiral Island is very relaxed. Port Owen has a slipway, three restaurants, a microbrewery and a gin distillery as well as shops.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The earliest mention of the original medieval guildhall was in 1359. This was replaced by a Jacobean Guildhall, built on approximately the same site, in 1625. It was considerably enlarged to a design by William Killigrew in 1725 and a series of specially commissioned paintings by Jan Baptist van Diest were subsequently put on display. The current Bath stone building, which was designed by Thomas Baldwin, was built between 1775 and 1778. It was extended by John McKean Brydon in 1893. The central facade has four Ionic columns and the building is surmounted by the figure of Justice. The central dome and the north and south wings were added in 1893 and form a continuous building with the Victoria Art Gallery which was also built around the same time. The Guildhall suffered considerable damage in a fire on 25 April 1972. The interior includes a banqueting hall with engaged Corinthian columns. It contains 18th century chandeliers and original royal portraits. The room is used on royal visits to the city: Queen Elizabeth II who had lunch in the banqueting room in May 2002. The building now houses the council chamber for Bath and North East Somerset Council and the Register office for Bath and North East Somerset; the building is also used as a wedding venue, and the record office also houses the Bath and North East Somerset Archives and Local Studies services. The Guildhall also serves as one of the venues for the Bath International Music Festival and other cultural events. It has been used for filming period dramas. Bath Guildhall Market  Bath Guildhall Market is located behind the Guildhall, and can be accessed by its own entrance tunnel through the Guildhall. It has traded on its site for the last 800 years.

It employs a flattening of objects into areas of color, where the modulations occur more as a result of an object interacting with the color and light of its environment than the sculptural modeling of form or presentation of textural detail. The actual color of an object, or 'local color', is held secondary to how that color interacts with surrounding light sources that may alter the look of the original color. Warm light of the sun, cool light from the sky, and warm reflected light bouncing off other objects are all examples of how a local color may be affected by its location in space. Earliest proponents of this style include the Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer and Hendrick Terbrugghen. Recent artists working with this style include the Boston School of painters, such as Edmund Tarbell and William McGregor Paxton. These artists combined vibrant Impressionist pastel colors with a more traditional palette, to create color-realist works that have a full range of dark to light values.A Legacy of Beauty: Paintings in the Boston School Tradition by Christopher Volpe Contemporary artists utilizing elements of this style include Sam Vokey, Charles Tersolo, and Barbara Glee Lucas. { Detail of Woman with a Water Pitcher, by Johannes Vermeer, showing yellow bodice becoming a mixture of purple and orange-yellow in shadow between waist and arms from reflected light.

However, \\"toward the end of the volume, when the relationship becomes more of a focus, Ichigo seems to self-destruct from some inner battle. It‚Äôs interesting, yet it‚Äôs boring, too, as her reactions show just how sensitive she is and seems to stereotype her as a high school girl who can‚Äôt control her own feelings\\".

Louise Petrine Amalie Phister, n√©e Petersen, (1816‚Äì1914) was a Danish stage actress. Life Bust by Theobald Stein, 1886 Phister grew up in poverty; on her father's death, she applied to become a chorister at the Royal Danish Theatre. The theatre, discerning her talent for acting, instead enrolled her to study as an actress, and she became the maid and student of Anna Nielsen in 1829. Phister made her debut in 1835. She took many parts as a soubrette, appearing also in vaudeville, breeches parts and, eventually, in roles depicting old women. She was decorated with the medal in service for actors, Fortjenstmedaljen, in gold in 1885, and broke a record when she retired in 1895 after sixty seasons on the stage. Her last performance came in 1901, as a guest star. She was married in 1846 to the actor Joachim Ludvig Phister.

Opening in 1912 Stationary circus building in Dresden Sarrasani was founded by Hans Stosch, a clown with the stage name Giovanni Sarrasani, who was born 1873 in Pozna≈Ñ. Stosch came 1901 to Radebeul near Dresden and the circus had its official premiere 1902 in Mei√üen. In the year 1912 a stationary circus building opened, which was designed by Max Littmann for Sarrasani. The circus often performed abroad and reached world fame. Its well-known labels were the elephants, but the circus was also known for the Sioux, who were employed from the early years. From 1923 to 1925 Sarrasani went on its first tour through South America. In these years, Stosch-Sarrasani also introduced innovative marketing concepts and wrote fictive adventure stories Fahrten und Abenteuer, Mit Sarrasani in S√ºdamerika. Totally, about 10 million copies of these booklets were distributed. After the death of Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Sr., his son Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Jr. took directorship. He was followed by his widow, Trude Stosch-Sarrasani, in 1941. The Sarrasani theater was destroyed on 13 February 1945 during the Bombing of Dresden in World War II. Trude Stosch-Sarrasani emigrated to Argentina, where she reestablished the circus in Buenos Aires as the \\"Circo Nacional Argentino.\\" The Argentine writer Gustavo Bernstein tells the story in the book Sarrasani, between the fable and the epic (Biblos, 2000), a fictionalized chronicle in which he accompanies the course of the mythical circus between Europe and America in the context of the sociopolitical events of the last century. The book distinguishes three aesthetic stages in the history of the circus, according to the conduction led by its founder Hans Stosch-Sarrasani (Senior), his son Hans Stoch-Sarrasani son (Junior) or his wife Trude Stoch-Sarrasani.Bernstein, Gustavo (2000). Sarrasani, entre la f√°bula y la epopeya. Editorial Biblos.  History  The story has two basic topics. On one side, a tale about a family of circus directors struggling to remain at the top of show business in the social context of Europe and South-America during the last century. On the other side, the epical facts of a colossal enterprise that survived the most transcendental political crisis, dealing ‚Äì voluntarily or by force ‚Äì with political leaders, dictators, bankers or businessmen from both continents. The Sarrasani Circus was founded in 1901, reaching a patrimony of 400 animals (not pets, precisely) and hiring a similar number of artists and technicians, hosting troupes from the most distant and exotic places: Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Moroccan, Hindus, Sioux, Ethiopians, Gauchos, Europeans, etc. Within this complex megalopolis, the Circus managed to sail through turbulent periods of this century emerging unharmed. Among them: World War I, the 1930s crisis, the Nazism, World War II, Joseph Stalin's troops arriving to Eastern Germany, the zenith of Peronism in Argentina and several coups d'√©tat in different countries. During the second Peronist period in Argentina the circus even changed its name to \\"National Circus of Argentina\\". Only since Germany's re- unification, Sarrasani's name was exalted again after almost a 50 year of proscription. The story is conceived as a road movie where the odyssey of an immense circus, a sort of Noah's Arc of people and animals, is an excuse to travel across two continents in different periods of the last century. A journey in space and time, this chronicle carries its own background of tango, epochal songs and circus orchestras. Besides the profuse network of historic characters, the tale focuses on three main personalities that were in charge of the circus at different times: Hans Stosch-Sarrasani, alias Senior, Hans Stosch-Sarrasani (son), alias Junior, and Trude, Junior's young wife. = Senior = Kurt Fiedler) Senior, the founder, was a dreamer, a visionary in show-biz obsessed with the idea of greatness, a megalomaniac who only conceived pharaonic projects that, incredibly, worked. His circus turned out to be a crossroad of cultures from all around the five continents and also the state-of-the-art in technology. Sarranni based his circus in Dresden and it reached a height of popularity there in the late 1920s. At around the same time, the Karl May Museum opened nearby. He toured not only around Europe, but also around South America, where he also moved the zoo and all that megalopolis on three enormous ships. Due to his stubborn and independent character, he had several problems with bureaucrats in power and especially with the ascendant Nazi regime that pushed him to emigrate. He established the circus in 1901 and ran it until his death in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1934. = Junior = Junior, his son, inherited the great name but also a chaotic financial situation and, even worse, an awful relation with the political authorities of his country. He didn't make big aesthetic changes on the scene but his pragmatic administration and a great sense of reality allowed the circus to cope with the worse crisis since its foundation. He had a special talent for diplomatic treatment with leaders in every country he arrived; he arranged with Joseph Goebbels the return of the circus to Germany for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Junior would run the circus during seven years from 1934 to 1941. = Trude = Trude, Junior's wife, a lovely and angelic young woman, found herself in charge of the circus aged only 28 years, during the Nazi regime. Her approach to running it was notoriously different from her male predecessors: she never commanded or ordered; on the contrary, she always delicately suggested. Minister Goebbels recommended the use of her young and beautiful figure in the circus posters as an icon of the Arian era. In 1944, however, she was sent to prison accused of anti-Germanic behavior. Two weeks later, Trude was released to continue performing, while Germany was immersed in the open war. Her partner, the Hungarian acrobat Gabor N√©medy, was kept prisoner as a way of persuasion. In 1945, during the show, she was caught in the bombing of Dresden, from which she fortunately emerged alive. After the war, she started over as an equestrian artist working for other circus. In 1948, an Argentine producer invited her to reestablish Sarrasani in Buenos Aires with the presence of President Juan Per√≥n and his wife, Evita, and began a very close relationship with them. Trude ran the circus until the mid seventies, albeit as a smaller enterprise. The popularity of cinema and TV, together with new cultural codes for animal care and use, led the circus to adapt to modern times. Trude Stosch-Sarrasani spent her last days in San Clemente del Tuy√∫ (a seaside resort town south of Buenos Aires) with Kiki, a little dog picked up from the street. Ms. Stosch-Sarrasani died there on June 6, 2009, at the age of 96. References Literature  * Bernstein, Gustavo. Sarrasani, entre la f√°bula y la epopeya.

The Act also made several procedural changes to the Chancery courts, most notably allowing them to call a jury, and allowed the Lord Chancellor to amend the practice regulations of the courts. By allowing the Chancery courts to award damages it narrowed the gap between the common law and equity courts and accelerated the passing of the Judicature Act 1873, and for that reason has been described by Ernest Pollock as \\"prophetic\\". After the English Court of Chancery was dissolved by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 the Act lost relevance, and in England and Wales it was gradually repealed by a succession of acts up to the 1880s. The Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act 1877, which reorganised the Superior Courts in Ireland to create the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal, similarly reduced the relevance of the Act in the Republic of Ireland. Background During the 19th century the higher courts were divided into two main types‚Äîcourts of Common Law, such as the Court of Common Pleas, and Courts of Equity such as the Court of Chancery; this reflected the two English court systems which had existed since the Middle Ages. Rules on court jurisdiction meant that common law courts could not grant orders of specific performance or injunctions, only damages, and courts of equity could only grant injunctions and orders of specific performance, not damages.Ramjohn (1998) p.6 This meant that a winning party in a chancery case who sought to claim damages was forced to open a second claim in a common law court,McDermott (1987) p.1 filling the courts with unnecessary cases and causing additional expense for the parties. The same was true of winners of common law cases who sought specific performance or injunctions. The common law courts were authorised to issue injunctions and orders of specific performance by the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, but nothing in the Act mentioned the Chancery courts. A Royal Commission \\"appointed to inquire into the Process, Practice and System of Pleading in the Court of Chancery\\" had been created in 1850 to investigate possible reforms to the Courts of Chancery, and they recommended (among other things) that the chancery courts be given the power to order damages and use a jury. The Act to implement the Commission's recommendations was introduced in 1857 as \\"Chancery amendment. A bill to amend the course of procedure in the High Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery in Ireland, and the Court of Chancery of the county palatine of Lancaster\\", and after passing through several committees was introduced to the House of Commons on 14 May 1858. The Act was piloted through Parliament by Sir Hugh Cairns (later Lord Cairns), the Solicitor General for England and Wales, and for this reason is commonly known as Lord Cairns' Act. It was passed by Parliament and came into force on 1 November 1858.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.1 Provisions of the Act The Act is relatively small, containing only 12 sections, including several sections on procedures. * Section 2 of the act was the most central one, allowing the Courts of Chancery to award damages \\"in all cases in which [they] have jurisdiction to entertain an application for an injunction.. or specific performance\\".Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.2 Although this section was repealed by, the general principles it set out are still valid law and are found in Section 50 of the Supreme Court Act 1981.Sharma (2003) p.226 * Section 3 of the Act introduced the right of the Chancery judges to call a jury to assess the amount of damages to be awarded and \\"any question of fact arising in a suit or proceeding\\".Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.3 These juries were to consist of the same type of person and be due the same rights as any jury in a common or criminal law case, and the judge was allowed to impose on them any rules permissible in a common or criminal trial. Historically Chancery judges were loath to call juries, but the right existed for them to do so anyway. * Section 4 gave the Chancery courts the same rights (in awarding damages and calling damages) as any other superior court allowed to do so.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.4 * Section 5 reserved the right of the court to conduct a trial without a jury,Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.5 * Section 6 allowed the court to order a jury to assess damages in any other common law court, on assize or in front of a high sheriff.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.6 * Section 7 allowed the court to order any party to provide all evidence to the other party without exception, with any party who refused to do so paying costs to the other side unless the judge said the refusal was reasonable.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.7 * Section 8 extended the Act to the Irish Chancery.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.8 * Section 9 allowed the Lord Chancellor to amend the Irish Chancery practice regulations.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.9 * Section 10 extended the Act to the Court of Chancery and the Chancery Court of the County Palatine of Lancaster. * Section 11 allowed the Lord Chancellor to amend practice regulations of these courts.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.11 * Section 12 Stated that these amendments were to be placed before Parliament, and would come into force within 36 days.Chancery Amendment Act 1858 S.12 Repeal After the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 dissolved the English Court of Chancery and unified the common and equity courts into the High Court of Justice, the 1858 Act became irrelevant since the ability to issue injunctions, order specific performance or award damages was given to all of the senior courts. In the United Kingdom the act was repealed piecemeal by multiple Acts of Parliament, including the Supreme Court of Judicature (Officers) Act 1879 and the Statute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1881. The act was formally repealed in its entirety by the Statute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1883. Although the Act applied to the Irish courts, they were unaffected by any of the repealing legislation.McDermott (1987) p.6 As a result, the provisions of the Act are still law in the Republic of Ireland, although they have been transferred several times. The Irish Chancery was merged into the High Court of Ireland by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877, but the same Act also transferred the rights under the 1858 Act to the new High Court. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 transferred these rights to the new Supreme Courts of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland respectively, and the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 finally repealed the 1858 Act in Northern Ireland. The Act is still valid in the Republic of Ireland, however, and the rights continue to be exercised by the High Court of Ireland. In many British Dominions local statute was passed to bring the 1858 Act into local law, and it is still valid in Ontario under the Courts of Justice Act 1984 and British Columbia under the Supreme Court Act 1986.

The song was also featured in the film Opie Gets Laid. It was also covered by Adam Sandler in the movie The Wedding Singer and by Himalayaz with Ms. Toi for the movie Love Stinks. The lyrics describe a love triangle in which two participants experience unrequited love, before segueing into a description of love gone sour in general. The lyrics may have been inspired by J. Geils Band lead singer Peter Wolf's marriage to actress Faye Dunaway, which ended in a 1979 divorce. Author Maury Dean describes the opening of the song as \\"ponderous Power Metal.\\" Dean describes the bands playing in the refrain as generating \\"wild waves of flame,\\" the guitars as \\"fire-breathing\\" and Wolf's vocals in the \\"yeah yeah\\" portion of the chorus as snarling with \\"heavy metal glee.\\" Justman provides extensive keyboards, which Associated Press critic James Simon feels gives the song \\"a little extra zing.\\" Viglione describes the riff as \\"Lou Reed's 'Vicious' as performed by his Rock & Roll Animal band on Lou Reed Live at half-speed,\\" also noting that it is a hard rock version of the riff from \\"Louie Louie.\\" Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield notes that the riff was later used by Nirvana in the song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" Viglione finds such a \\"simple riff rocker\\" a departure for the J.

It is a small, spreading shrub with cylindrical to flattened leaves and white or pink flowers arranged in corymbs on the ends of branchlets. The distribution includes an area on the Yorke Peninsula, but it is most common on the southern Eyre Peninsula. Description Homoranthus wilhelmii is a spreading shrub that grows to high and wide. The leaves are grey-green, scented, linear in shape and round to triangular in cross-section. They are long and about wide and terminate in a short, sharp point. The flowers are pink or white, slightly fragrant and arranged in a dense corymb at the ends of branches. The floral cup is cylindrical in shape, about long with five ribs on its sides and between three and six hairs on each of the five sepal lobes. The petals are about long and the five stamens are very short, alternating with tiny staminodes. The style is about long and has a beard near its tip. Flowering mainly occurs from September to March but the plant may flower and fruit sporadically throughout the year. Taxonomy and naming The eastern feather-flower was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller, who gave it the name Verticordia wilhelmii, adding that it is an \\"exceedingly pretty little bush\\". The description was published in his book Definitions of rare or hitherto undescribed Australian plants. In 1922, Edwin Cheel changed the name to Homoranthus wilhelmii. The specific epithet (wilhelmii) commemorates Carl Wilhelmi, a collector of seeds and specimens of the region, who obtained the type specimen at Port Lincoln in November 1854. Distribution and habitat Homoranthus wilhelmii grows in mallee shrubland between Minlaton on the Yorke Peninsula and Streaky Bay to the west of the Eyre Peninsula. It grows mostly on sandy soils in heath and woodland communities. Use in cultivation The species is not well known to horticulture, although trials in its cultivation have been successful in a number of regions of Australia. H. wilhelmii has been propagated, by enthusiasts of native flora, from seed and cuttings for private gardens. The plant grows in partly shaded or sunny positions, in sandy soil or well-drained loam, and has a long flowering period. Freshly cut flowering stems have a potential application in floristry. Conservation status Widespread, often locally common and well reserved.

Paquin, FamilySearch. Accessed March 6, 2011.) was an American football player. He played end for Fordham University as part of the 1936 line known as the \\"Seven Blocks of Granite\\". After graduating from Fordham, he eschewed a professional football career in favor of a 40-year career as a high school football coach and teacher. Biography Paquin grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts, and he attended Fordham University where he played college football as an end. While there, he roomed with another Fordham lineman, Vince Lombardi. As a senior in 1936, Paquin played as the left end on the Fordham line known as the \\"Seven Blocks of Granite\\". That line was actually the second one to bear that name. Fordham University publicist Tim Cohane had first applied the moniker to the Fordham line of the 1929 and 1930 seasons in an effort to garner the same level of recognition as Notre Dame's famed Four Horsemen. Incidentally, Jim Crowley, who coached Paquin and the second Seven Blocks of Granite had been one of the Four Horsemen. Fordham finished the 1936 season with a 5‚Äì1‚Äì2 record, but was more storied than its more successful counterparts from the subsequent year or the late 1920s. The final game was an upset at the hands of their cross-town rivals and heavy underdogs, NYU, which precluded a Rose Bowl invitation.Richard Goldstein, John Druze, Last of Fordham's Seven Blocks of Granite, Dies at 91, The New York Times, December 31, 2005.

Paquin's graceful play earned him the nickname \\"Twinkletoes\\". While at Fordham, he made the dean's list all four years. The New York Giants recruited Paquin to play professional football, but he turned down the offer. Instead, Paquin took a coaching position at Xavier High School in Manhattan, where he remained for the next four decades. Paquin worked at Xavier as a football coach, athletic director, and an English and Latin teacher.Robert McG.

John Mc Cormack the world famous Irish tenor sang C√©sar Franck's Panis angelicus at the mass.\\"Eucharistic Congress - A description\\", Ballymena Parish Approximately 25% of the population of Ireland attended the mass and afterwards four processions left the Park to O'Connell Street where approximately 500,000 people gathered on O'Connell Bridge for the concluding Benediction given by the Papal Legate, Cardinal Lorenzo Lauri. The Dundalk Democrat described the event: The English Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton was also present, and observed: \\"I confess I was myself enough of an outsider to feel flash through my mind, as the illimitable multitude began to melt away towards the gates and roads and bridges, the instantaneous thought \\"This is Democracy; and everyone is saying there is no such thing.\\" On the other hand, such an overwhelming display of Catholicity only confirmed to Protestants in the North, the necessity of the border.

WagriaArnold, Benjamin (1991). Princes and territories in medieval Germany, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, p. 156. . (, Waierland or Wagerland) is the northeastern part of Holstein in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, corresponding roughly to the districts of Pl√∂n and Ostholstein. The word \\"Wagria\\" is derived from Germanic settlement of Waringer and just a bit later the West Slavic Lechites tribe of Wagri or Wagier, which meant \\"those who live by the bays\\". Wagria was occupied from Viking of Haithabu. It seems that the Wagrier are identical with the East Germanic tribe of Waringer or Warnen (Latin: Warini). This country is a historical landscape of Viking myths.  Geography  Historical map of Wagria (ca. 1682-88) In the Middle Ages, and as still shown on early modern maps, Wagria was bordered on the north and east by the Baltic Sea from the Kiel Fjord to L√ºbeck Bay, and inland by the rivers Schwentine and Trave. Today, Wagria generally refers just to the Oldenburg Peninsula (Oldenburgische Halbinsel) in Ostholstein. The highest elevation in the peninsula is the Bungsberg at 168 metres.  History  The Lechitic (Slavic) root of the name, Wagria, meant not only the so-called, present-day Wagrian peninsula, but the entire region between the Kiel Fjord, the middle reaches of the Trave, and the lower course of the river; a region with this name emerged at least as early as the 8th century. Wagria Castle occupied a central location in Oldenburg in Holstein (then called Starigard, or \\"Old Castle\\"); its ramparts still exist. Important settlements in Wagria were Oldenburg, Old-L√ºbeck (Liubice), and Pl√∂n (Plune). In 1143, according to the vivid account by contemporary chronicler, Helmold of Bosau, Count Adolf II of Schauenburg and Holstein introduced German settlers, not only from his own territories of Holstein and Stormarn, but also from Westphalia and Holland, in order to develop the land of Wagria into a highly-profitable region as part of the German eastward expansion in the High Middle Ages: :\\"Then a countless number of people from different tribes left, took their families and possessions with them and went with Count Adolf in Wagria to take possession of their promised land. Initially, those from Holsten were given the most sheltered area west of Segeberg, on the River Trave, on the Schwentine flood plain and everything from the Schwale to the Grimmelsberg and Lake Ploen. The country around Dargun was settled by the Westphalians, the Eutin area by the Dutch and Suesel by the Frisians. The Pl√∂n area remained uninhabited however. He allowed Oldenburg, L√ºtjenburg and other coastal areas be colonised by the Slavs, who had to pay taxes to him.\\" The local Slavs were thus also involved in this expansion or development.

The Tintern Wireworks Branch was a short branch line on the Wye Valley Railway.

It closed in 1935 when the rails buckled in the heat of the summer.B. M. Handley and R. Dingwall, The Wye Valley Railway and the Coleford Branch, 1982, History=Wye Valley Amendment Act= In 1866 the Wye Valley Railway Company announced that it would not build a line through the village of Tintern, but by-pass it. To make up for this the company was forced to build a branch to the wireworks on the other side of Tintern. The Wye Valley Amendment Act was passed on 14 June 1875 stating that the company would forever maintain the branch and junction in good repair; as well as setting the regulations on running the line. =Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company= By August 1875, before the opening of the branch, the Abbey Wireworks Company had stopped trading. The line remained practically empty until the early 1880s when the works were taken over by the Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company; this venture was short lived and the works closed in 1901. The privately owned locomotive was sold and from then on the branch was only used by horses for the sawmills and turnery works in the village. =Closure= The line closed in 1935.

Early life He was born in Gartz on the Oder in the Province of Brandenburg, Germany. His parents were Rudolf Grobba, a nurseryman, and Elise Grobba, born Weyer. He attended elementary and high school in Gartz. Grobba studied law, economics and Oriental languages at the University of Berlin. In 1913, he received his doctorate of law. Grobba worked briefly in the German consulate in Jerusalem, Palestine. Palestine was then part of the Ottoman Empire. World War I During World War I, Leutnant Grobba fought for the Central Powers, as an officer of the Prussian Army. Grobba fought in France and with the Asia Corps on the Middle Eastern Front. Interwar In September 1922, Grobba joined the legal affairs department of the German Foreign Ministry of the Weimar Republic. In January 1923, he was transferred to Department 3 (Abteilung III), the department responsible for the Middle East. In October 1923, when postwar diplomatic relations were established between Weimar Germany and the Emirate of Afghanistan, Grobba was named Germany's representative in Kabul, with the rank of consul. In 1925, when the government of Emir Amanullah Khan accused him of attempting to help a visiting German geographer escape from Afghanistan shortly after the geographer shot and killed an Afghan citizen near Kabul, Grobba denied the charge. There was a diplomatic crisis between Germany and Afghanistan over the role of Grobba. In April 1926, Grobba was recalled to Berlin. From 1926 to 1932, Grobba served again in Abteilung III. He was now in charge of the section responsible for Iran, Afghanistan and British India. =Ambassador to Iraq and Saudi Arabia= From October 1932, he was appointed as the German ambassador to the Kingdom of Iraq and was sent to Baghdad. Grobba was able to speak both Turkish and Arabic. He frequently spoke of Arab nationalism and of ousting the British from the Middle East. Grobba purchased a Christian-owned newspaper, \\"The Arab World\\" (al-'Alam al-'Arabi). He serialised an Arabic version of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, and soon, Radio Berlin began to broadcast in Arabic.Podeh, p. 135 On 30 January 1933, Hitler became the chancellor. By the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler and his National Socialist German Workers Party were in full control over Germany. After the death of King Faisal I on 8 September 1933, Grobba convinced King Ghazi to send a group of Iraqi military officers to Germany for a milItary simulation. The officers returned home amazed. Grobba also convinced Ghazi to allow Germany to send 50 German officers to Iraq for war games. Ghazi was convinced to accept German \\"research expeditions\\" to Iraq. Unlike the Iraqis, the Germans did not return home but stayed in Iraq for the long term. Grobba enthusiastically supported a virulently anti-imperialist group of Iraqi officers, the \\"Circle of Seven\\".Tripp, p. 99 Its four leading officers were nicknamed the \\"Golden Square\\". They would represent real power, as successive Iraqi governments sought the support of the military for survival. They had long looked to Germany to support them, which Grobba enthusiastically encouraged.Lyman, p. 11 In 1938, a main British pipeline in Iraq was attacked and set on fire by Arabs. When the attack was claimed to be connected to Grobba, he was forced to flee. Grobba fled to the court of King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Since 1937, Ibn Saud was reported to be \\"on the outs\\" with the British,Time Magazine, July 3, 1939 and, in 1939, his emissary was reported to be seeking arms in Germany.Nicosia, p. 190 From November 1938 to September 1939, Grobba was also the German Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Beginning of World War II On 1 September 1939, Nazi Germany occupied Poland and World War II began. On 3 September, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. After Germany and the United Kingdom became enemies, the Kingdom of Iraq deported German officials and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. However, contrary to Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, Prime Minister Nuri Said chose not to have Iraq declare war on Germany despite Article 4: \\"Should... either of the High Contracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will... immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally.\\" In addition to refusing to declare war, Said also announced that Iraqi armed forces would not be employed outside of Iraq.Lukutz, p. 95 On 31 March 1940, Said was replaced by Rashid Ali as Prime Minister. On 10 June, when Fascist Italy joined the war, on the side of Germany and against Britain, the Iraqi government under Ali did not break off diplomatic relations with Italy.Playfair, p. 177 That violated Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. On 3 February 1941, after much tension and calls for his removal, he was replaced as Prime Minister by Taha al-Hashimi, a candidate acceptable to Ali and the members of the \\"Golden Square\\". From October 1939 to May 1941, Grobba served in the German foreign ministry in Berlin. Iraqi coup On 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali and members of the \\"Golden Square\\" led a coup d'√©tat in Iraq. During the time leading up to the coup d'√©tat, Rashid Ali's supporters had been informed that Germany was willing to recognize the independence of Iraq from the British Empire, there had also been discussions on war material being sent to support the Iraqis and other Arab factions in fighting the British.Lyman, p. 63 War in Iraq On 2 May 1941, after much tension between the Rashid Ali government and the British, the besieged forces at RAF Habbaniya under Air Vice-Marshal H. G. Smart launched pre-emptive air strikes against Iraqi forces throughout Iraq and the Anglo-Iraqi War began for real. On 3 May, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop persuaded Hitler that Fritz Grobba be secretly returned to Iraq to head up a diplomatic mission to channel support to the Rashid Ali regime. Grobba was to return under the alias \\"Franz Gehrke.\\" Grobba's mission was to be sent to Iraq along with a military mission commanded by the High Command in the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW). The military mission had the cover name \\"Special Staff F\\" (Sonderstab F) and it included Brandenburgers and a Luftwaffe component. Sonderstab F was commanded by General Hellmuth Felmy.Kurowski, pg. 131 On 6 May, Luftwaffe Colonel Werner Junck received instructions in Berlin that he was to take a small force of aircraft to Iraq. While under Junck's tactical direction, the force was to be under the overall direction of Lieutenant General Hans Jeschonnek and was to be known as \\"Airplane Commander for Iraq\\" (Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak). The aircraft of Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak were to have Iraqi markings and they were to operate out of an air base in Mosul, some 240 miles north of Baghdad. Also on 6 May, Grobba and his mission flew from Foggia to Rhodes in two Heinkel 111 bombers which were dubbed the \\"F√ºhrer Courier Squadron.\\"Kurowski, p.130 The mission was accompanied by two Messerschmitt 110 fighters. On 9 May, they reached Aleppo in Vichy French-held Syria.Lyman, p. 64 On 10 May, the mission reached Mosul and after contacting the Iraqi government, Grobba was told to come to Baghdad as soon as was possible. On 11 May, they reached Baghdad. On 16 May, Grobba met in Baghdad with Colonel Junck, Rashid Ali, General Amin Zaki, Colonel Nur ed-Din Mahmud, and Mahmud Salman. The group agreed to a number of priorities for Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak. The first priority was to prevent the British flying column Kingcol from relieving RAF Habbaniya. The second priority was for Iraqi ground forces to take Habbaniyah with air support provided by Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak. An overall priority for the Germans was to provide the Iraqi Army with a \\"spine straightening\\". Much of the army was known to be terrified of bombing by British aircraft.Lyman, p. 68 In the end, Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak failed to make the impact envisioned by the Germans, RAF Habbaniya was not taken by the Iraqi ground forces, and whether or not the Germans stopped Kingcol did not matter. The air and ground forces at the besieged air base drove off the Iraqis before Kingcol arrived. On 7 May, RAF armoured cars confirmed that the Iraqis on the escarpment above the base were gone.Lyman, p. 51 It was not until 18 May that Kingcol arrived to \\"relieve\\" Habbaniya.Lyman, p. 60 By 22 May, British and Commonwealth ground forces advancing from Habbaniya took and held Fallujah for good. They then began the advance on Baghdad. On 28 May, Grobba sent a panicked message from Baghdad reporting that the British were close to the city with more than 100 tanks. By then, Junck had no serviceable Messerschmitt 110 fighters and only two Heinkel 111 bombers with just four bombs between them.Lyman, p. 84 Late on 29 May, Rashid Ali, several of his key supporters, and the German military mission fled, under cover of darkness. On 30 May, Grobba fled Baghdad. Grobba's escape took him through Mosul and then through Vichy French-held Syria. A British flying column commanded by Major R. E. S. Gooch and nicknamed Gocol was created to pursue and capture Grobba. To accomplish this, Gocol first made its way to Mosul and arrived there 3 June. The column then drove west and illegally entered French territory, just prior to the commencement of the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. During the week following 7 June Gocol made efforts to capture Grobba. The column entered Qamishli in Syria, fully expecting to capture him there, but found that Grobba had already been and gone.Lyman, p. 87 In the end, Gocol failed in its mission, and Grobba escaped to Nazi occupied Europe. Later life In February 1942, Grobba was named foreign ministry plenipotentiary for the Arab States, a job that entailed liaison between the German government and Arab exiles in Berlin such as Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. In December 1942, Grobba was named to the Paris branch of the German archives commission. He held the post until his brief return to the foreign ministry in April 1944. In June 1944, Grobba was officially retired from the foreign ministry. However, he continued to work there until the end of the year. In 1945, Grobba worked briefly in the economics department of the government of Saxony, in Dresden. At the end of the war, Grobba was captured and was kept in Soviet captivity until 1955. Memoirs In his 1957 memoirs, Men and Power in the Orient, Grobba summarized as \\"wasted opportunities\\" the Middle East policy of Germany during the 1930s. He thought that Germany did not take enough advantage of the Arab hostility towards both the United Kingdom and France. According to Grobba, Germany's failure in the Middle East tracked directly to Hitler. Hitler was uninterested in the Middle East, and deferred to both British and Italian interests in the Mediterranean area. Hitler also expressed a disinclination to eliminate all of the power of the British. Ultimately, Grobba indicated that Hitler was never willing to lend his support to Arab independence and national self-determination.

The building, constructed between 1844 and 1847 (architect: P.Rosenbaum), is parallel to the tracks. The station was initially a terminus of the Krak√≥wUpper Silesia Railway (Kolej Krakowsko-G√≥rno≈õlƒÖska, ). The design was chosen to allow for future line expansion. Trains entered the trainshed via an archway in a brick wall at the northern end of the station. The new Krak√≥w Glowny station. The station opened on 13 October 1847, with the first train leaving for Mys≈Çowice (the point where the Austrian, German and Russian Empires adjoined during their military partitions of Poland). When the railway line was extended eastwards by the k.k. priv. galizische Carl Ludwig-Bahn (the first section, to Dƒôbica, then Dembitz in the Habsburg Empire, opened in 1856). The increasing traffic resulted in the station being modernised and enlarged in stages between 1869 and 1894. The next substantial expansion took place in the 1930s. At that time the northern brick wall and trainshed were demolished, the latter replaced by individual platform roofs. A new transport interchange was developed which included a coach station and an underground fast tram line. A new shopping centre (Galeria Krakowska, Krak√≥w Gallery) opened in September 2006. The construction of the Galeria Krakowska and remodelling of the area in front of the main station building means that taxis are no longer able to drive up to the station building, instead they can drive to the parking situated directly above railway tracks and connected by lifts and steps with platforms and underground ticket hall.

Drutsk was given to Rogvolod-Boris. Soon its territory was taken over by another appanage duchy of Polotsk, Duchy of Minsk governed by Gleb Vseslavich. In 1116, the duchy of Drutsk was taken over by the Grand Duchy of Kiev governed by Volodymyr Monomakh, but by 1150s it was returned to Duchy of Minsk.

The camp was in a scenic location at the end of a dirt road on a lake officially known as Clement Pond, but known to generations of Merrimac campers as Lake Josylvia. Several of the old Cloughville buildings survived the transition‚Äîthe local post office became the camp office. The ice house was the head counselor's shack. The village hall housed the mature staff, and a 19th-century barn lasted until it fell down one winter about 1960. Mr. Price and Mr. Pick ran Camp Merrimac until the late 1940s when it was purchased by Abe Beleson, a teacher at the Bronx High School of Science. In 1953, Maury Bleifeld became a part owner, and in 1954 Harry Levine bought a share of the camp. In 1957, Werner Rothschild, Robert \\"Bob\\" Bomze, and Fred Egre purchased the property. In 1958, Egre was bought out while Rothchild and Bomze continued operating the camp. Keeping the name Camp Merrimac, they continued to run a general summer camp program. One innovation they introduced in the 1960s was to have counselors from England, Sweden, and other European countries. In addition, being physical education teachers, they began the New England Hockey Camp and New England Figure Skating Camp. Youth would travel by bus to Concord, New Hampshire, to the Everett Arena for ice time. Both boys and girls attended the camp from after World War II until 1998. The majority of campers came from the New York metropolitan area at first. From the late 1980s until the end campers came from all over the United States, plus Canada, Mexico and Europe. Nearing retirement, and perhaps a bit exhausted after 40+ summers at camp, Mr. Rothschild and Mr. Martin (as Bomze was then known) were ready to sell. They wanted the property to remain a youth facility. They were searching for a buyer who would continue youth programs. In September 1998, the camp was sold to the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston. =St. Methodios= The completed Retreat House as seen in summer 2010 The Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston established a youth camp program in 1990. After years of using other area camp grounds around New England to support the growing community, the Metropolis decided to buy its own campground. The former Camp Merrimac property was purchased with the help of a $500,000 donation by former pharmaceutical company owner George D. Behrakis in the summer of 1998. Regular camp sessions began at the site in 1999, along with an ambitious program to winterize, improve, and expand the campground. As part of this modernization program, new water and waste water systems were designed and installed, the cafeteria was renovated, adding a new kitchen, and the rec hall was remodeled. The former barn was extended and a bell tower added to create a 200-seat chapel and all of the cabins on the eastern side of the camp were rebuilt over a ten-year period. In 2006, Metropolitan Methodios and the Camp and Retreat Center Committee drafted plans for a new lodge on the shore of Clement Pond which would consist of 30 rooms with private accommodations for families, couples, individuals, clergy and laity. The plan was met with criticism from area property owners who felt that the new building would bring \\"noise, traffic and lighting [that] will destroy the place they go to get away\\", but it was ultimately approved by the Hopkinton Zoning Board of Adjustment in 2007. After the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Hopkinton Zoning Board, construction began in the summer of 2008.

The upkeep of this institution was paid for through taxes levied on sedan chairs, hackney coaches and a House Tax applied throughout the city.Burke, Helen, The People and the Poor Law in 19th Century Ireland (Littlehampton, 1987), pp 9-10. After the tax was lifted on 5 January 1823, the workhouse was mainly supported through grants from the Irish Parliament. Another House of Industry was founded in 1773 in Channel Row, modern-day North Brunswick Street, on the north side of the city.Reynolds, Joseph, ‚Äò‚ÄôGrangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815‚Äô‚Äô (Dublin, 1992), p. 5. In 1796 it accommodated more than 1,700 people. Following an Act of the Irish Parliament, responsibility for its management was assumed by seven 'governors', elected annually by, and out of, the members of Dublin Corporation. At about this time, a number of mechanical innovations by Benjamin Thompson were incorporated into the building for improved ventilation, cooking and heating. > It is to be observed, that this institution differs very materially from any > poorhouse, or other institution, in Great Britain, both in its object, its > government, and its resources. In Ireland, there are no poor laws, or local > taxes, for the support of the poor. This institution was provided for the > purpose of providing employment, and for the maintenance of the poor of > Dublin, and for the punishment of the vagrants and beggars who infested the > streets of that city. Observations of Thomas Bernard 1799 p156 The House of Industry offered housing for beggars, vagabonds, deserted children under the age of eight, and the mentally insane. In 1773, the workhouse was reformed and split into a hospital for the mentally insane, a workhouse for the poor located in, and a foundling hospital to be primarily used for the safety and education of the admitted children. This foundling hospital took in deserted infants in Dublin but owing to abnormally high mortality rates (four out of five) the foundling hospital came under scrutiny and investigation. These investigations found strong evidence of malpractice directly responsible for the death of thousands of children. The House of Commons stopped allowing new admissions to the hospital in 1831. The workhouse where vagabonds and beggars were sent fell under similar scrutiny. In 1805 Sir John Carr in his Tour of Ireland described the workhouse as \\"A gloomy abode of mingled want, disease, vice and malady, where lunatics were loaded with heavy chains and fallen women bound and logged\\". and Parliament believed the House of Industry was a failure and \\"completely worthless\\" Described as 'the Dublin Poor House', it was also visited by the French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, during his investigative tour of Ireland. Tocqueville described the conditions of the inmates there as 'the most hideous and disgusting aspect of destitution'. The food provided was soup rendered from left-overs collected in a wheelbarrow from the wealthy. With the passage of the Irish Poor Law in 1838, the House of Industry on James's Street became the South Dublin Union and the one on Channel Row became the North Dublin Union.Burke, Helen, The People and the Poor Law in 19th Century Ireland (Littlehampton, 1987), p. 10.

A high opinion of his trustworthiness was held by Jerningham Wakefield, who communicated it to John Robert Godley. Port Lyttelton, 1850, by Mary Townsend The Townsend family \\"formed one of the most popular and colourful groups in early Christchurch.\\" In 1851 Townsend built a homestead, Ferrymead House, in what is now Ferrymead. It was described as \\"a fine house, with parallel twin gables, seven rooms, totara exterior walls lined with Tasmanian timber\\"; and went to the family of William Reeves. Townsend advertised his farm at Ferrymead for sale in 1853 but it did not sell. The Townsends moved in 1856 to Rangiora. In 1859 the Rangiora Cricket Club was formed. One team of the time was notable for having nine out of eleven players connected to the Townsend family. In 1860 Townsend put up his farm and its stock, at Southbrook, for public auction. Family Townsend married in 1820 Alicia Burges, daughter of Capt. Henry Burges of the East India Company.

Initially working as a clerk at a Consistory Court he attended the University of Oxford from 1576 to 1580, graduating with a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) degree, and was admitted to the bar at York to work as an ecclesiastical lawyer. As well as his work as a lawyer he held various administrative and judicial positions. He died in 1624. Swinburne is best known for his two legal treatises, particularly A briefe treatise of Testaments and last Wills which remained a standard work on family law for 200 years after his death. Swinburne was the first ecclesiastical law writer to write in English. Early life and education Swinburne was born in 1551 in the ward of Micklegate, York, to Thomas Swinburne and Alison Dalynson. After an education at Archbishop Holgate's School he became a clerk in the Consistory court in York. After becoming a notary public of the court he matriculated to the University of Oxford in 1576, studying at Hart Hall, and while there met and married Ellen Lant, daughter of Bartholomew Lant. He graduated from Broadgates Hall, Oxford in 1580 with a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, and a few years later was called to the ecclesiastical bar at York.Baker (1993) p.1 Career As well as his work as a lawyer, Swinburne also held multiple judicial and administrative posts. He became Auditor of the Peculier of the Dean of York in 1593, commissionary of the York exchequer court in 1604 and worked in the Court of High Commission between 1607 and 1622. By 1613 his wife had died and he married Margaret Wentworth - they had a son, Toby Swinburne, in the same year. Writing Swinburne is best known for his two treatises on law - A briefe treatise of Testaments and last Wills, first published in 1590, and A treatise of Spousals, or Matrimonial Contracts, published posthumously in 1686 based on a draft found in Lincoln's Inn. Swinburne was the first ecclesiastical law writer to write his books in English. A briefe treatise of Testaments and last Wills was his most well-known work, and became a standard text for family law for almost 200 years, being reissued in seven different editions up to 1803. It was first published in 1590 by John Windet and corrected and edited by Swinburne himself.Baker (1993) p.2 The book was intended to rectify a fault in the canon law system - that there were so many hundreds of books on various bits of canon law that it was impossible to read all of them and get an accurate picture of a particular area of law. Swinburne intended to rectify this by publishing a single book on family law which could act as a substitute to the hundreds of other texts on the matter. The book was written in English so that it could be read by a wider audience, and was the first ecclesiastical law text to be written in such a way. The book was \\"a model of clarity and scientific technique\\" set up in an orderly fashion that contrasted sharply with the disjointed nature of the nearest common law equivalents by James Dyer and Ambrose Gilbert. It summarised a mass of canon law judgments previously written in Latin and became a \\"landmark in jurisprudence\\".Baker (1993) p.3 After the copyright was acquired by the Company of Stationers in 1607 it was reprinted and edited repeatedly. A treatise of Spousals, or Matrimonial Contracts was being written up to Swinburne's death in 1624, and was only published in 1686 when a draft was found in the library of Lincoln's Inn. There is evidence that it was intended to be one of three volumes on the subject, although the other two were never started, even in draft form.

K√§rn√§koski fortress as part of the South-Eastern Finland fortification system  K√§rn√§koski Fortress was part of a larger South-Eastern Finland fortification system built to protect Saint Petersburg, the capital of Russian Empire. After the Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790), and particularly in the light of the Swedish victories in the Battle of Porrassalmi and the naval Battle of Svensksund, Russian empress Catherine II decided to strengthen the defences in the north-western border of the empire. The construction of a large fortification system in south-eastern Finland was entrusted to general Alexander Suvorov. To protect the capital three concentric fortress chains were built, with K√§rn√§koski fortress belonging to the outermost chain located very near the border. K√§rn√§koski fortress was built to both defend against a possible land-based attack from the isthmus between Saimaa lake the Gulf of Finland and to provide a base for the recently formed Russian Saimaa fleet.  Construction  General Suvorov, responsible for the construction of the South-Eastern Finland fortification system, selected the mouth of K√§rn√§joki river on the isthmus between Saimaa lake and Kuolimoj√§rvi lake near the Lappeenranta-Ristiina road as a location for one of the new border fortresses. The location allowed the fortress to guard the border between Sweden and Russia, control the traffic going via the road and monitor the shipping routes in western Saimaa. The area near the fortress had been a site for several engagements between Swedish and Russian troops in the Russo-Swedish War that had just ended. K√§rn√§koski Fortress was constructed between 1791 and 1793. The designers of the fortress were French engineering officers who had fled the French Revolution to Russia. K√§rn√§koski fortress was built according to the traditional French bastion system. However, instead of a uniform regular bastion shape, the fortress was built as an irregular shape and followed the terrain, most likely because of the limited space available. The western and southern sides of the fortress were guarded by three demi-bastions. Also three outworks, ravelins, were built in front the main fortress wall. The less- vulnerable eastern and northern sides that were mostly protected by lake shore were defended only with tenailles. An earthwork wall and a moat surrounded the fortress and the outworks. The fortress had a rear gate in the northern tip where it was possible to reach the ships and to get water. 55 cannon positions were built on fortress walls. Inside the fortress were built barracks, guardhouse, officers quarters, brig and gunpowder magazine. The wooden buildings have been later demolished, and now only remnants of stone bases remain of them. In addition to the main fortress, two additional supporting forts, redoubts, were built in the vicinity. The K√§rn√§koski redoubt, also called the Mountain fort, was built 600 metres away from the main fortress to guard one entrance to the isthmus where the fortress was built. Partakoski redoubt was built two kilometres to north-west to guard the other side. 1400 Russian soldiers and local peasants took part in building K√§rn√§koski fortress. A substantial number of workers perished from hard work and illnesses.  Fortress was used for only a short time  Ravelin in front of the main wall. K√§rn√§koski fortress guarded the Russian north-western border for only 15 years. During that time the fortress was also one of the bases for the Russian Saimaa fleet. Other bases were the Lappeenranta Fortress and Olavinlinna castle in Savonlinna. After the Russian-Swedish border moved westwards to Tornionjoki river in 1809 after the Finnish War, the fortresses in south- eastern Finland lost their military value, K√§rn√§koski fortress among them. Tsar Nicholas I closed down the now-unnecessary inland fortresses in 1835. As a result, the fortresses were disarmed, the buildings and remaining equipment were auctioned and the walls and fortifications were left untended. K√§rn√§koski fortress was built to protect against the Swedish threat, but never did see action against the intended enemy. During the Finnish War, the only war between Sweden and Russia when the fortress was in use, the battles took place far from the fortress after Swedish army retreated from the border before Russian advance avoiding battle. A century later in the Civil War of Finland the area nearby did see several battles.  K√§rn√§koski fortress today  Today K√§rn√§koski fortress is a tourist attraction, although there are no guided tours or other tourist or travel services in the fortress, simply guidance signs. Finnish National Board of Antiquities and Finnish Ministry of the Environment have listed the fortress area as nationally significant cultural historic landmark. Finnish National Board of Antiquities has restored K√§rn√§koski fortress to its former shape together with other fortresses in south-eastern Finland. Walls were repaired and the fortress area was restored and cleared. The work was finished in 1997. An inventory of the vegetation in the fortress area was conducted in 1987, based on which work began to maintain an old meadow biotope vegetation in the area. The area was reaped and cleared of young trees. Currently sheep are allowed to graze in the area during summer to maintain a traditional pasture in order to provide a suitable habitat for organisms that have become vulnerable after traditional agriculture began to modernize. Other historical buildings nearby are an old barge harbor, mill and saw built in the 1830s and a double-arch stone bridge from 1886. The mill has not been used since the 1950s, but was restored by a local village organization in 2002.

Early life Palmer was born in Ickwell, Bedfordshire, England, the son of Henry Fyshe who assumed the added name of Palmer because of an inheritance, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Ingram of Barnet. Palmer was educated at Eton College and Queens' College, Cambridge from 1765, with the purpose of taking holy orders in the Church of England. He graduated B.A. in 1769, M.A. in 1772, and BD in 1781. He obtained a fellowship of Queens' in 1781, and officiated for a year as curate at Leatherhead, Surrey. While at Leatherhead he was introduced to Samuel Johnson, and dined with him in London; but he had become disillusioned with some aspects of the Church of England. Unitarian Palmer then read in Joseph Priestley's works, and became a Unitarian. For the next ten years Palmer preached Unitarianism to congregations in Dundee and other Scottish towns. A Unitarian society had been founded by William Christie, a merchant, at Montrose, and Palmer offered his services as a preacher (14 July 1783). In November 1783 Palmer reached Montrose, and remained as Christie's colleague till May 1785. He then moved to Dundee to become pastor of a new Unitarian society there, and he founded a Unitarian church. He preached also in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Arbroath, and Forfar, and formed further Unitarian societies. In 1789 he took temporary charge of the society at Newcastle. In 1792 his sermons in Edinburgh attracted attention, and pamphlets were published in refutation of his doctrines. Activism and trial When agitation for political reform began in 1792, Dundee became one of its centres in Scotland. A society called the 'Friends of Liberty' was formed in 1793, and met in the Berean meeting-house in the Methodist Close, beside the house where Palmer lived in the Overgait. The society was composed mainly of working men. One evening in June 1793 Palmer was attended a meeting, when George Mealmaker, weaver in Dundee, brought a draft of an address to the public which he purposed circulating as a handbill. Palmer revised it, modifying it to a complaint against the government for war taxation, and a claim for universal suffrage and short parliaments. The address was sent to be printed in Edinburgh in July 1793. The authorities were alarmed, and decided to meet an anticipated revolution in time; and, in the belief that they were attacking a revolutionary leader, Palmer was arrested in Edinburgh on 2 August on a charge of sedition as the author of the document. At the preliminary legal inquiry he refused to answer the questions put to him, pleading his ignorance of Scots law. He was confined in Edinburgh gaol, but afterwards freed on bail. An indictment was served on him directing him to appear at the circuit court, Perth on 12 September to answer to the charge. The presiding judges were David Rae, Lord Eskgrove and Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby; the prosecutor was John Burnett, advocate-depute, assisted by Allan Maconochie; and Palmer was defended by John Clerk, and Mr. Haggart. One of the first witnesses was George Mealmaker, who admitted that he was the author of the address, and stated that Palmer was opposed to its publication. Other officials of the 'Friends of Liberty' corroborated, and the evidence proved nothing relevant to the charge beyond the fact that Palmer had ordered one thousand copies to be printed, but had given no instructions as to distribution. Both the judges summed up adversely, and, when the jury found the accused guilty, he was sentenced to seven years' transportation. The conviction of Palmer, following close on that of Thomas Muir, raised indignation among the Whig party throughout the kingdom; and during February and March 1794 attempts were made by the Earl of Lauderdale and Earl Stanhope in the House of Lords, and by Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan in the House of Commons, to obtain the reversal of the sentence. But the government, under William Pitt, was too strong. Transportation Palmer was detained in Perth Tolbooth for three months, then taken to London and placed on the hulk Stanislaus at Woolwich, where he was put in irons for forced labour for three months. Palmer left in the Surprize, along with the so-called Scottish Martyrs, Thomas Muir, William Skirving and Maurice Margarot, embarking in February but sailing in April 1794, with a gang of convicts for Botany Bay. The vessel arrived at Port Jackson, New South Wales, on 25 October, and as Palmer and his companions had letters of introduction to the governor, they were well treated, and had houses assigned to them. Whilst serving his seven-year sentence in Sydney Palmer did not suffer the usual convict restraint, and he engaged in business enterprises. Besides cultivating the land, the exiled reformers constructed a small vessel, and traded to Norfolk Island. At the end of 1799 Palmer and his friend James Ellis‚Äîwho had followed him from Dundee as a colonist‚Äîcombined with others to purchase a vessel in which they might return home, when Palmer's sentence expired in September 1800. Journey and death Palmer and Ellis intended to trade on the homeward way, and provisioned their vessel for six months; but their hopes of securing cargo in New Zealand were disappointed, and they were held up for half a year. They sailed to Tongatabu, where a war prevented them from landing. They steered for the Fiji Islands, where they were well received; but while making for Goraa, one of the group, their vessel struck a reef. Having refitted, they started for Macao.

Adverse storms drove them about the Pacific until their provisions were exhausted, and they were compelled to put in at Guguan, one of the Ladrone Islands, then under Spanish rule. Spain and Britain were then at war, and Spanish governor treated them as prisoners of war. When Palmer was attacked with dysentery, he succumbed. He died on 2 June 1802, and was buried by the seashore. Two years later an American captain touched at the Isle of Guguan, and, having found out where Palmer had been buried, he had the body exhumed and taken on board his vessel, with the governor's permission. The remains were taken to Boston, Massachusetts, and reinterred in the cemetery there. Monument inscription. A monument was erected in the Old Calton Cemetery, Edinburgh, in 1844 to commemorate Palmer, Muir, and the other Scottish Martyrs. Works Palmer's publications were mostly magazine articles and pamphlets. To the Theological Repository he contributed regularly in 1789‚Äì90, as Anglo-Scotus. In 1792 he published a controversial pamphlet entitled An Attempt to refute a Sermon by H. D. Inglis on the Godhead of Jesus Christ, and to restore the long-lost Truth of the First Commandment, against Henry David Inglis (1757‚Äì1806). His Narrative of the Sufferings of T. F. Palmer and W. Skirving was published in 1797. Several of his letters were published in the biographies of contemporary unitarians.

Princes of Turov often served as the Grand Princes of Rus early in 10th-11th centuries. The principality's capital was Turov (now called Tura≈≠) and other important cities were Pinsk, Mazyr, Slutsk, Lutsk, Berestia, and Volodymyr. Until the 12th century the principality was very closely associated with the principalities of Kiev and Volhynia. Later for a short period time until the Mongol invasion it enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy when it was annexed to the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. In the 14th century it became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia. History The Principality of Turov originated mainly from the Dregovich tribe and partially the Drevlyans. While circumstances of its creation are not clearly known, the Principality as mentioned in the Primary Chronicle existed in 980. According to the legend, the town of Tura≈≠ was founded around 950 (first mentioned in 980) by Varangian Prince Tur, a brother of Rogvolod (the first chronicled prince of Polatsk). =Kiev Principality= During the times of Vladimir the Great (980 - 1015), the city of Turov and the immediate vicinity became part of Kievan Rus. Around 988, Vladimir appointed his eight-year-old son, Sviatopolk I of Kiev, to be knyaz of Turov. Later, Vladimir jailed Sviatopolk for plotting to rebel. Shortly before Vladimir died, Sviatopolk was freed and, upon Vladimir's death, seized the mantle of Grand Prince of Rus. =Izyaslavichi= In a series of three battles during 1016-1018, Yaroslav the Wise overthrew his older brother, Svyatopolk, and became Grand Prince of Kievan Rus. About 1042 or 1043, Yaroslav married his eldest son, Izyaslav, to the sister of King Casimir I of Poland and appointed Izyaslav to be knyaz of Turov and Pinsk. In 1054, Izyaslav became Grand Prince of Rus, with a volatile reign. In 1078 after Izyaslav's death, Isyaslav's brother and new Grand Prince, Vsevolod, appointed Izyaslav's eldest son, Yaropolk Izyaslavich to be knyaz of both Volhynia and Turov. In 1084, the Rostislavichi, rulers of neighboring Galicia (Halychyna), attempted to seize part of Yaropolk's realm, but Yaropolk and Vsevolod's son, Vladimir Monomakh, defeated the invaders. Yaropolk revolted briefly against Grand Prince Vsevolod, was reinstated, and was murdered in 1087 (likely by the Rostislavichi). =Opposition to Vladimir Monomakh= The Turov principality was passed to his younger brother Sviatopolk II who administered the land of Novgorod. When Svyatopolk became the Grand Prince of Rus, he passed the principality of Turov to his nephew and son of Yaropolk Vyacheslav. Later Svyatopolk gave Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Brest to his sons Yaroslav and Mstislav respectively. As the Grand Prince Svyatopolk also tried to conquer the rebellious Rostislvichi who established themselves well in the land of Halych. However, his attempts were rather unsuccessful. In 1100 the principality of Turov was passed to Yaroslav Svyatopolkovich who ruled both lands of Turov and Volhynia. During another conflict between the prince of Turov and the Grand Prince of Rus Yaroslav was eliminated out of his realm in 1118. The land of Turov then was passed to another son of Svyatopolk Bryachislav, while Volhynia was given to one of the sons of Vladimir Monomakh Roman. The 1097 Council of Liubech modified the rota system such that the Principality became patrimonial land. =Reinstatement= After the death of Bryachislav Vladimir, Monomakh gave the Turov principality to his Vyacheslav who kept it until the middle of the 12th century. Around the 1150s Turov belonged to the descendants of Yuri Dolgoruki Andrei and Boris. Finally in 1162 the principality was passed by Yuri Dolgoruki back to one of the Izyaslavichi Yury Yaroslavich, grandson of Svyatopolk II of Kiev, who gained full independence from Kievan Rus'. However, at the same time the Principality became more and more divided between several sons of the duke Yury. A semi- independent Principality of Pinsk was created. Along with the Principality of Smolensk, the army of Turau participated in the Battle of the Kalka River in 1223. =Decline= In the early 13th century the Principality of Turov became dependent of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. To liberate itself from it, the dukes of Turov cooperated more and more with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the early 14th century the Principality non-violently joined the Grand Duchy. By that time Hleb Narymunt, the son of Gediminas, was already ruler of Pinsk, while Turov and Haradok were still ruled by Rurikids.

It was named after Nicolas-Marie-Jean-Claude Fay de Sathonay, mayor of Lyon from 1805 to 1812, as a tribute for all the importants works undertaken under his presidency. The square is currently the third largest square in Lyon and belongs to the zone classified as World Heritage Site by UNESCO. According to Lyon geography agr√©g√© Jean Pelletier, it is \\"one of the most interesting squares of Lyon\\", because of its harmonious proportions, its boundaries composed of buildings with beautiful 1920s facades, and its plantations, which brings \\"a charm tinged of poetry\\" and give it the appearance of a village square. History=The former square= Before the deliberation of the municipal council on 22 August 1817, the square was called Place de la D√©serte. According to the 1268 Tractatus de bellis, inhabitants of Lyon built fortifications in the D√©serte to defend themselves from the ecclesiastical authority. In 1296, Blanche de Ch√¢lons, widow of the lord of Beaujeu, Rhone acquired from Jean Mallerie the parcel \\"proche de la porte nouvelle\\" (near the new gate) and founded in 1304 the monastery or abbey of the same name, which they gave to the Ladies of Saint Clair or Clarisses or which came under the rule of Saint Benoit. In 1318, Blanche de Ch√¢lons' son left the vine of the Varissonni√®re to the religious order, and in 1439, the businessman Pierre du Ny√®vre transferred the Clos of the vine, which enlarged the field of Order of Poor Ladies. In 1745, their possessions were composed of a quadrilateral area bounded by the Rue du Sergent Blandan (south), the Mont√©e des Carm√©lites (west), the Rue du Bon Pasteur (north) and the Mont√©e de la Grande C√¥te (east). From 1791, the property of religious congregations of the hill of La Croix-Rousse were sold and became a national property. The first property auction was that of the Carthusians in September 1791. The gardens of the lower part were given free to the city by decrees of the representative of the people Poulin-Grandpr√©, on 14 November 1795. In 1802, this steepest part of the land to the north, was turned into a garden of plants, still visible today. The southern part of the place was given to the city on 19 January 1818. The rest of the buildings belongs now to the Department as a national property and was ceded to the Lyon city. Finally, the buildings were destroyed in 1813, excepted the building that currently houses the City Hall of the arrondissement, and replaced by a square paved with pebbles and flat stones. =The contemporary square= In 1817, the municipal architect Louis Flach√©ron proposed to enlarge the square and to create an entry to the garden of plants. The square, almost immediately named Place Sathonay, was created under the Mayor of Fargues and was studied in detail by a committee chaired by Paulet which drew up the plan which was approved on 10 December 1817. Providing a good view on the steps at the north appeared to be a major concern then: indeed, the idea of erecting a central fountain was eventually withdrawn for this reason, and the whole composition was based on a north-south axis, as shown by the original plan. It had an area of 4,000 m¬≤, and the stairs at the north of the square next to the city hall provided an access to the former garden of plants. Knight and Baron Antoine Fay (18th century), architect Louis Flacheron and lawyer Jean Pine des Granges (19th century) lived on this square. Circa 1830, an ancient Roman house with a bathroom and three mosaics was discovered at the corner of the rue Poivre. The City Hall of the 1st arrondissement In 1830, houses with commercial or mixed use (i.e. for both housing and work) in 1820s-1830s buildings are mainly composed of one or two rooms (52%), but there were also some commercial premises with seven-eight rooms. The square was mainly inhabited by small traders (60%) and silk agents (26%). Family and professional life was often merged as 69.2% of homes had both uses. Those who had a flat exclusively for housing on the place were mainly rentiers (40%) who generally lived at second and third floors with about 3.7 rooms. There was, at that time, none loom on the square. In 1831, the buildings at Nos. 5 and 6 of the square were respectively the second and the fifth new buildings of the eastern part of the hill which had the highest rental value (11,045 and 9,200 FF). They were composed of 46 and 31 apartments with a total of 105 and 86 rooms. Architecture=Buildings= The statue of Blandan, on the square To the north, the square is opened by a staircase called the mont√©e de l'Amphith√©√¢tre and flanked by two identical buildings, the one on the left built between 1819 and 1823. On both sides of the staircase, there are two fountains adorned with bronze lions made by the Fonderie nationale du Creusot and erected in 1823, which are replicas of the lions adorning the Acqua Felice Fountain in Rome. The side streets were built around 1820-1821. At the east and west, there are four buildings of four floors. The architecture of the facades is usually very rich. Indeed, according to writer Josette Barre, \\"the facades are opulent, decorated with wrought iron railings, large doorways in wood, stone, pilasters and pediments for most openings of the first floors. The windows are high up to the third floor, then smaller with openings sometimes replaced by a mansard at the last floor\\". The corner traboule of the Place Sathonay, which crosses a building built in 1822, is closed. There is currently the Police station of the 1st arrondissement, at No. 5 (the building immediately at left of the staircase). =Statue and fountain= In the nineteenth century, the square was decorated with a fountain topped by a bronze statue portraying French inventor Joseph Marie Jacquard, made by Foyatier and inaugurated on Sunday 16 August 1840; however, the statue was later removed. The site was successfully planted with chestnut trees at the same time. There are some benches and, near the city hall, an impatiens clump and buxus. At the center of the square, there is currently a statue of Jean Pierre Hippolyte Blandan (also named Sergeant Blandan), born in the neighborhood and killed during the conquest of Algeria in 1842. The 2.8-metre statue in bronze was made by Thomas Lamotte and was raised on a stone plinth by architect Joseph Dubuisson and the whole cost 19,420 francs. It was inaugurated on 22 April 1900 at an expensive ceremony reported in Le Progr√®s. But it disappeared during the Second World War and was replaced by a new statue in stone after the war. There is a statue of Virgin Mary at No. 4, rue des Farges.

The reorganization of occupied dioceses during World War II was an issue faced by Pope Pius XII of whether to extend the apostolic authority of Catholic bishops from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to German-occupied Europe during World War II. Although such reorganization was often refused, the decision of Pius XII to appoint German apostolic administrators to occupied Poland was \\"one of his most controversial decisions\\". These actions were the primary justification given by the Soviet- backed Polish Provisional Government (which replaced the pro-Catholic Polish government-in-exile), for declaring the Concordat of 1925 null and void in 1945, an act that had tremendous consequences for post-war Polish-Holy See relations. There was no Apostolic Nuncio to Poland between 1947 and 1989. History A note from Reich ambassador to the Holy See, Diego von Bergen, dated August 29, 1941 demanded that \\"all ecclesiastical appointments to important posts in annexed or occupied regions be first communicated to Berlin\\". The note was meant to apply to all \\"residential bishops, coadjutors with the right of succession, prelati nullius, apostolic administrators, capitular vicars, and all having equivalent functions in the government of a diocese\\". Explicitly included in this demand were Alsace, Lorraine, Luxembourg, lower Styria, Carinthia, and Carniole, as Germany viewed the right of consultation on appointments granted by the Reichskonkordat as extending to occupied territory. The Holy See explicitly refused this demand on January 18.Blet, 1999, p. 74. Tardini wrote in August 1940: > The present historical moment is very serious from this point of view: > Hitler, the persecutor of the Church and the master of much of Europe, > wishes in one way or another to impose the appointment of German bishops > within non-German territories, and he wants to exercise and influence on the > appointments, more so than previously agreed to....

By the end of the war, most of the surviving Catholic priests in Albania were of Italian origin, having been used by the fascist regime for the expansion of Italian culture and influence.Kent, 2002, p. 46. Following the Italian invasion, \\"the Catholic Church enjoyed a position of favour and influence throughout the Second World War\\". Anton Harapi, a Catholic priest, was made regent, and Maliq Bushati, a Catholic, was made prime minister. According to Kent, \\"in Albania, more than in any other country, the Catholic Church had been an antinational force in the service of the national enemy\\". =Belgium= The deaneries of Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnet, all Diocese of Li√®ge, but annexed to Nazi Germany, were subordinated to an Apostolic Administrator, first (1941‚Äì1943) Hermann Joseph Str√§ter, diocesan administrator of Aachen, and then (1943‚Äì1945) Johannes Joseph van der Velden, Bishop of Aachen.Akten der Partei-Kanzlei der NSDAP: Rekonstruktion eines verlorengegangenen Bestandes; Sammlung der in anderen Provenienzen √ºberlieferten Korrespondenzen, Niederschriften von Besprechungen usw. mit dem Stellvertreter des F√ºhrers und seinem Stab bzw. der Partei-Kanzlei, ihren √Ñmtern, Referaten und Unterabteilungen sowie mit He√ü und Bormann pers√∂nlich, Helmut Heiber (comp.) on behalf of the Institut f√ºr Zeitgeschichte (ed.), Munich et al.: Oldenbourg et al., 1983, vol. 1, part 1, p. 561. . =Czechoslovakia (western part)= The heartland of Western Czechoslovakia became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia of the Reich in 1939. In October 1938, the western border regions of Czechoslovakia had been dissected and annexed mostly by Nazi Germany (Sudetenland) and, to a small extent, by the Second Polish Republic (Zaol≈æje, an area of Czechoslovak Silesia). These annexations had only partially been internationally recognised at the time and were reversed after World War II. Most of the people in the Budejovice diocese were of Czech ethnicity (with a small German minority).Blet, 1999, p. 95. A. Eltschkner was appointed bishop and the German government was notified even before an announcement appeared in L'Osservatore Romano.Blet, 1999, p. 96. On July 24, von Bergen demanded a bishop of German ethnicity or nationality for Budejovice (hinting his favor for J. Remiger), referencing the appointment of French bishops to Metz and Strasbourg in 1919. An investigation was conducted by the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, which concluded that the original appointment should be followed through.Blet, 1999, p. 97. After the Polish takeover of Zaol≈æje, never internationally recognised, the Polish government had requested the Holy See to disentangle the parishes there from either the Archdiocese of Breslau (northerly Zaol≈æje) or the Archdiocese of Olomouc (southerly Zaol≈æje), respectively, both traditionally comprising cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. The Holy See complied and Pope Pius XI then subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaol≈æje to an apostolic administration under Stanis≈Çaw Adamski, Bishop of Katowice, who held that position until 31 December 1939.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174, here p. 160. . On 23 December 1939 Orsenigo appointed ‚Äì with effect of 1 January 1940 ‚Äì Breslau's Archbishop Adolf Bertram and Olomouc' Archbishop Leopold Preƒçan as apostolic administrators for exactly those Catholic parishes of Zaol≈æje, where Pius XI had deposed them in 1938.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174, here p. 162. . =Estonia= Eduard Profittlich, S.J., the apostolic administrator of Estonia, was one of many Catholic clergy victims of the Soviet deportations from Estonia in 1941. The Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany actively prevented the Catholic hierarchy from reconstituting itself although Jesuit Henri Werling was permitted to assume the duties of Msgr. Profittlich. =France= Charles Ruch, Bishop of Strasbourg was expelled after the German annexation and could return only in 1945. After a francophile manifestation on the occasion of the feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August) in 1940, the Nazi occupants expelled Joseph-Jean Heintz, Bishop of Metz and he could return only in the autumn of 1944. =Hungary= Hungary obtained some territory of former Romania on August 29, 1940, and in turn, it demanded ecclesiastical reorganisation. That was denied by the Holy See. =Lithuania= An agreement between Lithuania and the Soviet Union brought the city of Wilno and the Wilno Region under the jurisdiction of still- independent Lithuania on October 10, 1939. The Lithuanian government requested to have Archbishop Romuald Ja≈Çbrzykowski removed from the see. The reply of Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione was that \\"the government of Kaunas should appreciate that the Holy See cannot run behind armies and change bishops as combat troops occupy new territory belonging to countries other than their own\\". Ja≈Çbrzykowski was expelled by the Germans in 1942. When auxiliary bishop Meƒçislovas Reinys took over Ja≈Çbrzykowski, further tension was sparked between the Poles and Lithuanians.Dunn, 2004, p. 107. =Poland= Following the occupation of Poland (1939‚Äì1945), the government of dioceses was \\"one of the first questions the Holy See had to face\\".Blet, 1999, p. 71. Many of the main sees were vacant prior to the war, including Warsaw, where Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski had died in December 1938. In Krakow, elderly Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha had sent his letter of resignation to the pope. Cardinal August Hlond, the primate of Poland, was unable to return to his Archdioceses of Pozna≈Ñ-Gniezno, having accompanied the Polish government-in- exile to Romania and then continued to Rome. However, he had appointed vicars general to represent him, Cathedral Capitular Eduard van Blericq for Gniezno and Auxiliary Bishop Walenty Dymek for Pozna≈Ñ.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174, here p. 158. . Other bishops had been forced out of their dioceses in the first days of the war such as Stanis≈Çaw Okoniewski, the bishop of Che≈Çmno-Pelplin, and Karol Mieczys≈Çaw Rado≈Ñski, the bishop of W≈Çoc≈Çawek. Archbishop Antoni Julian Nowowiejski of P≈Çock diocese was killed at Soldau Concentration Kamp i Dzia≈Çd√≥w. Okoniewski's auxiliary bishop Konstantyn Dominik was interned by the end of 1939. Furthermore, Rado≈Ñski's auxiliary bishop Micha≈Ç Kozal was arrested by the end of 1939 and eventually died in Dachau concentration camp; the auxiliary of Lublin, Bishop W≈Çadys≈Çaw Goral was similarly arrested and killed in Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen as was Bishop Leon Wetmanski, the auxiliary of P≈Çock, at Auschwitz. Indeed, the German occupants undertook a systematic policy of forcing bishops from their dioceses, interning and arresting them. Approximately 2,600, or 20% of all, Polish clergy members were killed by the Nazis, including five of the six bishops of the Reichsgau Wartheland; priests were targeted for their resistance activities and cultural importance.Phayer, 2000, p. 22.Phayer, 2008, pp. 22-23. Along the Nazi-Soviet demarcation line, established by the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, rather than appointing new bishops in the newly dissected dioceses, the bishops of neighboring diocese were made to serve as apostolic administrators. The apostolic administrators, in turn, were to designate two priests who could replace them in the event of their death or arrest.Blet, 1999, p. 72. Almost immediately, the Reich's ambassador to the Holy See, Diego von Bergen, made it clear that Nazi Germany would like to see German prelates made temporary administrators of the sees whose bishops had been deposed. Prelate Franz Hartz, German Territorial Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl, was suggested by the ambassador as administrator for Gniezno- Pozna≈Ñ, Danzig's Bishop Carl Maria Splett for Che≈Çmno-Pelplin, and Breslau's Archbishop Adolf Bertram for Katowice, which had been disentangled from his see in 1922. According to Monsignore Domenico Tardini, Pius XII \\"acknowledging the soundness of this proposal, has decided to postpone it\\". Except for Splett, the Holy See did not take up any of the proposals. As the nuncio to Warsaw, Filippo Cortesi, had fled with the government-in-exile, Pius XII extended the jurisdiction of Cesare Orsenigo, the nuncio to Germany, to Poland on November 1. Nazi Germany strictly opposed Orsenigo's competence for Poland because the Holy See did not recognise the German annexations of Polish territory and Danzig, but it upheld its diplomatic ties with the Polish government-in-exile. By November 29, Pius XII reversed his stance against appointing foreigners to sees in occupied Poland.Blet, 1999, p. 73. Orsenigo suggested to Pius XII it would be \\"opportune to appoint\\" Splett as apostolic administrator to Che≈Çmno-Pelplin. Splett was bishop of then exempt Danzig diocese which belonged to the nunciature to Poland, and he was a Danziger so he was not German until the annexation of his home country only weeks before his appointment.Arguments presented in an article in Pozna≈Ñ-based G≈Ços Katolicki on 23 September 1945, here after Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174, here p. 166. . So Pius XII agreed that Orsenigo designated Splett the apostolic administrator to Che≈Çmno-Pelplin with effect of 5 December 1939.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174, here p. 161. . The government-in-exile, now in London, saw this as a betrayal of the 1925 concordat between the Holy See and Poland, which prohibited placing any Polish territory under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside Poland. It was very unusual that not the Consistorial Congregation or the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, respectively, in the papal name, but Orsenigo, using special papal plenipotentiary powers, appointed Splett, a peculiarity repeating with each appointment of foreign apostolic administrators in German annexed and occupied Poland. Cardinal Adolf Bertram, whom Orsenigo made apostolic administrator for Catholic parishes in Zaolzie. On 23 December 1939 Orsenigo appointed Bertram and Leopold Preƒçan, Archbishop of Olomouc, as apostolic administrators for the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie with effect of 1 January 1940. Zaolzie was actually a Czechoslovak area, which Poland had annexed on 2 October 1938 on the grounds that most Czechoslovaks there were of Polish ethnicity. The parishes there actually had belonged either to the Archdiocese of Breslau or to the Archdiocese of Olomouc, respectively, both traditionally comprising crossborder diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. When the Polish government demanded after the Polish takeover of Zaolzie, still lacking international recognition, that the parishes there be disentangled from these two archdioceses, the Holy See complied. Pope Pius XI then subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie to an apostolic administration under Stanis≈Çaw Adamski, Bishop of Katowice. In Zaolzie Bertram and Preƒçan replaced Adamski in 1940, who again had replaced them there in 1938. It is wrong, however, that Bertram, as apostolic administrator, replaced Adamski as bishop of Katowice.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939‚Äì1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939‚Äì1989, Hans-J√ºrgen Karp and Joachim K√∂hler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: B√∂hlau, 2001, pp. 157‚Äì174. . On 22 June 1940, Orsenigo informed Splett that he would appoint him also apostolic administrator for the diocesan territories of P≈Çock (Lipno county) and of W≈Çoc≈Çawek (Rypin county) within Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, if the respective bishops would consent. Bishop Antoni Julian Nowowiejski of P≈Çock agreed. After Nowowiejski's murder in Soldau concentration camp on 28 May 1941 the Holy See invested his vicar general Stanis≈Çaw Figielski as apostolic administrator on 6 March 1942. On 7 January 1941 the Holy See appointed Boles≈Çaw Gumowski for the German annexed Suwa≈Çki Region within the Diocese of ≈Åom≈ºa. In early 1941, Bertram, Metropolitan bishop of the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and speaker of the Fulda Conference of Bishops, rejected the request to admit the Danzig diocese as member in his ecclesiastical province and at the conference. Any arguments that Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany did not impress since Danzig's annexation lacked international recognition. Bishop Adamski of Katowice, whom German occupants prevented from carrying out his duties since 1940, had appointed Franz Stry≈º as vicar general. In early 1941, Adamski was expelled from Katowice diocese, which made Stry≈º appeal at Orsenigo in March the same year to invest Heinrich Wienken as apostolic administrator.Wienken had already successfully served Bishop Petrus Legge of Meissen, when the Nazi government had superseded him through a political suit between 1935 and 1937. However, the Holy See refused. After Stry≈º's death, the exiled Adamski secretly invested as new vicar general Franz Wosnitza (1902‚Äì1979) on 3 June 1942. Having grown up in K√∂nigsh√ºtte (Chorz√≥w), Wosnitza had been studying Catholic theology in Breslau when his hometown turned Polish in 1922. He then decided to move back home to become bilingual and to live as German expatriate in the Polish Katowice diocese, where its Bishop Hlond consecrated him priest on 20 June 1926.Hans Ludwig Abmeier, \\"Wosnitza, Franz\\", in: Ostdeutsche Biographie. He started a career as priest also serving the minority of Poles of with German as anative language. The Consistorial Congregation, pretending the late Stry≈º had chosen Wosnitza, confirmed the latter as vicar general, an act not required by canon law for a vicar general appointed by his bishop, to help Adamski conceal that he was still acting in secret as bishop of Katowice. Wosnitza's appointment silenced the claims of the German occupants to invest an apostolic administrator of their choice. On 18 October 1941, Orsenigo appointed Joseph Paech (1880‚Äì1942), Capitular vicar of Pozna≈Ñ-Gniezno, as apostolic administrator for the Catholics among the German minority in Poland within Reichsgau Wartheland. For the Catholic parishioners of Polish language in Wartheland, Orsenigo appointed Auxiliary Bishop Dymek as apostolic administrator on 9 April 1942, but in August of the same year, he declared his resignation because of German obstruction and violence. After Paech's resignation through ill health, Nazi Germany requested for Pius XII to appoint a German apostolic administrator. On 2 May 1942, Orsenigo then made Father Hilarius Breitinger, since 1934 serving as German expatriate at Pozna≈Ñ's Franciscan Church of St. Anthony of Padua,Martin Sprungala, \\"Breitinger, Hilarius\\" , in: Ostdeutsche Biographie. the apostolic administrator to the Reichsgau Wartheland for the Catholic parishioners of German language.Kent, 2002, p. 37.Diskin, 2004, p. 28. The Polish government-in-exile protested the appointments of Breitinger and Splett as violations of the concordat. On November 12, the government-in-exile issued a statement from London stating that \\"Pius XII's decision is tantamount to the acceptance of illegal German demands and comprises an unfriendly act towards the Polish people\\".Diskin, 2004, p. 29. Relations between the Holy See and the government-in-exile appreciably worsened, and the Holy See countered that the government-in-exile itself had abrogated the concordat by not ensuring communication between the Vatican and the Polish clergy.Kent, 2002, p. 124. According to Phayer, \\"betrayal was exactly what Poles felt when Pius appointed the German Franciscan Breitinger the apostolic administrator to the Wartheland in May 1942\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 6. However, Pius XII appointed foreigners Splett and Breitinger to fill the Polish bishoprics in parallel with the Polish incumbents, complying with German demands, originating from Wartheland's Reichsstatthalter Arthur Greiser, that only German clergy could fulfill the spiritual needs of ethnic Germans. While the bishops living under German occupation, like Adamski, Teodor Kubina (1880‚Äì1951; Czƒôstochowa), Nowowiejski, and Sapieha considered their agreement to and the appointments of administrators for (parts of) their dioceses as the only way to maintain some precarious, though, modus vivendi for the Catholic Church under the anti- Christian and anti-Polish ideology of Nazism, bishops in exile like Hlond and Rado≈Ñski were more concerned about these emergency measurements because Polish Catholics could resent them as additional humiliation, and Nazi Germany could gain from them a propagandist benefit, misinterpreting them as complaisances by the Holy See. Postwar legacy Cardinal August Hlond forced out German prelates after the war and replaced them with Polish ones. On September 12, 1945, the Provisional Government of Poland declared the Concordat of 1925 null and void as a result of the \\"unilateral violation by the Holy See stemming from illegal conduct repudiating its principles during the occupation\\", primarily as a result of the appointment of German apostolic administrators in violation of article 9.Diskin, 2001, p. 47. German prelates in Poland after the war were viewed as collaborators with the occupation. Carl Maria Splett, the bishop of Danzig and administrator of Che≈Çmno, was tried for collaboration in January 1946. He was accused of aiding the persecution by suppressing the Polish language within his diocese and barring the return of Polish prelates even after they were released from the Nazi concentration camps. When he defended himself by claiming he was following the orders of the Gestapo, the prosecution retorted that he just as easily could say he was following the orders of the pope. On February 2, 1946, the special tribunal in Gdansk sentenced Splett to eight years in prison, denial of civil rights for five years and confiscation of property. The trial of Splett galvanised widespread anti-Vatican and anti Romam/Italian Curial sentiment among Polish Catholics. NotesReferences *Blet, Pierre, and Johnson, Lawrence J. 1999.

Background There were originally eight principles formulated by the Central Asian Sufi teacher Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani (died 1179), the last three of the eleven being added later by Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari (1318‚Äì1389), founder of the Naqshbandi Order. Editor: Hayter, Augy. Both were Khwajagan (Masters) of the Sufi tariqah (path, way or method). These principles are designed to be borne in mind and used as spiritual practices or exercises in the Naqshbandi system of spiritual development. They are carried out under individual tuition, expertly prescribed, monitored for changes, and carefully adjusted by a teacher, rather than being automatically performed. The principles have been brought to the attention of contemporary Western audiences through the works of the writers Idries Shah, John G. Bennett, Omar Ali-Shah and J. Spencer Trimingham. The exercises were an important aspect of Omar Ali-Shah's work with groups in the modern Naqshbandi tradition in the West. For instance, one of Ali-Shah's books of edited transcripts, The Rules or Secrets of the Naqshbandi Order, was devoted to this subject. The Eleven principles The Eleven principles are as follows, First published by Octagon Press in 1956. Editor: Hayter, Augy. 2nd revised edition. First published 1971. shown in the order used by Idries Shah in A Perfumed Scorpion, which differs slightly (in items 5 to 8) In A Perfumed Scorpion, Idries Shah gives the order of the first eight principles as shown in this article, and the first eight accord with those given at naqshbandi.org, whereas Omar Ali-Shah gives the order as: 1\\\\.

The Pope initiated a policy of Christian‚ÄìJewish reconciliation after his election to the papacy in 1959, which focused on the Second Vatican Council producing a document on the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jews. During his earlier career in the diplomatic service, especially during World War II, he had taken a series of actions that demonstrated his solidarity with victims of anti-Semitism. Diplomatic career Before becoming pope, Angelo Roncalli, later John XXIII, held a series of posts in the diplomatic service of the Holy See, including stints in Bulgaria from 1925 to 1934, Apostolic Delegate to both Greece and Turkey from 1934 to 1944, and ending as nuncio to France from 1944 to 1953. The extent to which he acted independently or at the direction of the Vatican is disputed, a question that plays a part in the debate over the role of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He at times relayed information and at other times intervened. For his actions during the 1930s and 1940s, in 2011 the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation petitioned the Yad Vashem museum to recognize Roncalli as one of the \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\", an honor reserved for non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust. ;Hungary According to the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, Roncalli forwarded a request for the Vatican to inquire whether other neutral countries could grant asylum to Jews, to inform the German government that the Palestine Jewish Agency had 5,000 immigration certificates available and to ask Vatican Radio to broadcast that helping Jews was an act of mercy approved by the Church. In 1944, Roncalli used diplomatic couriers, papal representatives and the Sisters of Our Lady of Zion to transport and issue baptismal certificates, immigration certificates and visas, many of them forged, to Hungarian Jews. A dispatch dated 16 August 1944 from Roncalli to the papal nuncio to Hungary illustrates the intensity of \\"Operation Baptism\\": ;Romania In February 1944, Roncalli met twice with Rabbi Isaac Herzog (Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog), chief rabbi of Jerusalem. Herzog asked him to intercede for 55,000 Jews interned in Romania, another Axis ally. Though Roncalli notified Rome, only 750 Jewish refugees ‚Äì 250 of them orphans ‚Äì were saved when their ship arrived in Palestine.Ibid ;Slovakia and Bulgaria With the help of Boris III of Bulgaria, a reluctant Axis ally, Roncalli used the Red Cross to save thousands of Slovakian Jews who had been deported to Bulgaria. ;France As Nuncio for France, Roncalli ignored a directive not to return baptized Jewish orphans to their parents.Jerusalem Report, (7 February 2005). Papacy Pope John XXIII made several gestures to demonstrate his sympathetic feelings for the Jewish community. He sent a message to the Grand Rabbi of Israel announcing his election, even though the Holy See did not recognize the State of Israel. On 17 October 1960, he met with a delegation of 130 American Jews associated with the United Jewish Appeal. He greeted them with words from the Bible \\"I am Joseph your brother\\" to establish that he and they were starting a new relationship despite what may have passed between Catholics and Jews before, as Joseph reconciled with his brothers in Book of Genesis. On 17 March 1962, he stopped his car when he saw people exiting the synagogue in Rome and blessed them in the morning. A rabbi described the scene: \\"after a moment of understandable bewilderment, the Jews surrounded him and applauded him enthusiastically. It was in fact the first time in history that a pope had blessed Jews and it was perhaps the first real gesture of reconciliation\\". =Good Friday Prayer for the Jews= In 1959, Pope John XXIII removed the Latin word () from the prayer for the conversion of the Jews in the Good Friday liturgy. This word had long been an object of complaint as it was commonly translated with the cognate \\"perfidious\\", expressing contempt for the Jews even as the Church prayed for their conversion, and the Vatican in the late 1940s under Pope Pius XII had advised that the word was more correctly translated as \\"faithless\\" or \\"non- believing\\".This misunderstanding is based on an inadequate understanding of medieval Latin. In classical Latin, perfidus did have a meaning similar to its present English analogue, derived as it was from the phrase per fidem decipere, \\"to deceive through trust.\\" However, by late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, perfidus and perfidia simply meant the opposite of fides and fidelis. The prayer was revised to read: :Let us pray also for the Jews: that almighty God may remove the veil from their hearts; so that they too may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us pray. [Let us kneel. Arise.] Almighty and eternal God, who dost also not exclude from thy mercy the Jews: hear our prayers, which we offer for the blindness of that people; that acknowledging the light of thy Truth, which is Christ, they may be delivered from their darkness. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen. John XXIII demonstrated his commitment to the change in language during the Good Friday service in St. Peter's Basilica in April 1963. When the canon reciting the eight prayers included the word \\"perfidis\\" when chanting the Prayer for the Jews, the seventh prayer, the Pope signaled for the liturgy to stop and then had the sequence of prayers repeated from the beginning with the word omitted. In a related action, Pope John in 1960 modified the language used in baptizing adults, removing the warning against returning to one's earlier religious faith, with texts available for a pagan, Muslim, Jew, and heretical Christian. In the case of a Jewish convert the text was: \\"You should abhor Hebrew perfidy and reject Hebrew superstition.\\" The modification was made because Pope John wanted \\"to emphasize everything that unites and to remove anything that unduly divides believers in God\\". =Nostra aetate= Marc H. Tanenbaum's work in the field of Jewish-Christian relations was galvanized when Pope John XXIII called for a revitalization of the Catholic Church in the form of the Ecumenical Council in 1961. At the time, Rabbi Tanenbaum was Director of Interreligious Affairs at the American Jewish Committee. He supervised an initiative which addressed the negative portrayal of Judaism in Catholic textbooks and in the liturgy. It included concrete steps to alleviate tensions and reduce prejudice. He worked alongside Jewish philanthropist Angelo Donati to settle the dispute. In 1962, when Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council, Augustin Cardinal Bea used Dr. Rose Thering's study to draft portions of the 1965 Vatican document Nostra aetate (\\"In Our Age\\"), which declared of Christ's death that \\"what happened in his passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today,\\" and, as for teaching, added, \\"The Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God.\\" Decretum de Iudaeis is the name given to the series of draft documents of the Second Vatican Council which led to ground-breaking progress in the Church's relations with Jews. Cardinal Bea had been commissioned by Pope John XXIII to write the \\"Decree on the Jews\\", which was completed in November 1961. The first draft document essentially went nowhere, never having been submitted to the Council, which opened on 11 October 1962. Nostra aetate is the Second Vatican Council's document on interfaith relations. Passed by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled bishops, it was promulgated on 28 October 1965, by Pope Paul VI. Although John XXIII had already died when the statement was passed, it is generally thought to be strongly influenced by the late Pope's teachings. =Relations with Israel= Although Pope John XXIII was generally popular with Jews, he did not publicly recognize the State of Israel, essentially because of issues surrounding Church properties and support for post-1948 refugees, as explained in the document In multiplicibus curis. His encyclical Pacem in terris has at times been re-evaluated in the context of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.

Born around 1670 near what is now Westfield, Massachusetts, he eventually became the most illustrious and prominent leader to arise among the dwindling Waranoak, once the predominant original inhabitants of the central Connecticut River Valley in today's New England region. Dummer's War The mid-1720s conflict known as Dummer's War (also known as Greylock's War, Three Years War, Lovewell's War, Father Rasle's War, or the 4th Indian War) was a series of battles and raids between the region's English colonists and groups of the Wabanaki Confederacy. The legendary Chief Gray Lock rose to prominence during this period, marshaling and organizing Native resistance based in Otter Creek and, further to the northwest, on the Missisquoi near today's Swanton, both in what is now Vermont.Colin Calloway, p. 120; Canadian Bio On Line for Gray Lock Tablet of the Chief Grey Lock monument, Battery Park (Burlington, Vermont) French colonists and traders are recorded as the first Europeans to explore the Kennebec River area, in what is now Maine, with Samuel Champlain arriving in 1604 and claiming the area for France. Soon afterward, however, English colonists began to homestead lands along the Kennebec long occupied by the Abenaki Indians, who regarded them as their own. As the pattern of English settlements in the area continued, the French and Abenaki formed an alliance against them. The rising tensions erupted into open conflict in 1722. With the French, New York English colonists, and the Iroquois looking on, Abenaki war parties commenced raiding the expanding English northern-tier settlements of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, all the way from coastal Maine to Lake Champlain. Gray Lock rapidly distinguished himself as the pre-eminent Abenaki military leader, conducting frequent and successful guerrilla raids in areas of what are now southern Vermont and western Massachusetts. He consistently eluded his pursuers, acquiring among his peers the warrior's name of Wawanolet (v. Wawanolewat, Wawanotewat), which means roughly \\"he who fools the others, or puts someone off the track.\\" In August 1723, he led a war party which descended upon the English settlements at Northfield and Rutland, escaping with English captives. English scouts and cavalry were mustered and put on high alert, but in October Gray Lock once again attacked Northfield, escaping safely. With additional settler troops being raised and deployed as a result, early in 1724, by Massachusetts Bay Colony decree, a blockhouse, known as Fort Dummer, was erected by the colonists on the west bank of the Connecticut about ten miles north of Northfield, immediately south of today's Brattleboro, Vermont, to help guard against future attacks. The colonial garrisons already established at Northfield, displacing the Abenaki from their traditional winter hunting grounds and camps, were strengthened as well. The last of these settler parties withdrew from the field in March and April 1725, whereupon Gray Lock's contingent left their winter quarters, again throwing the settlements into a state of alarm. Intending reprisals, Captain Benjamin Wright set out in July for Missisquoi with a body of recruits, but having provisioned inadequately, aborted their mission and returned south. Gray Lock dogged Wright all the way to Northfield, with alarms and skirmishes continuing in and around Fort Dummer and Deerfield for the remainder of the summer months. Eastern Abenaki groups made peace with Massachusetts in 1725 and 1726, and Abenaki bands in Canada agreed to peace terms in 1727, but Gray Lock refused, mounting sporadic raids on the colonies over the next two decades or so. The best available accounts indicate that Gray Lock died a free man around 1750, his name already a legend even among his enemies, and with family and stalwart followers around him. Legacy Mount Greylock in Western Massachusetts is thought to have been named in tribute to chief Gray Lock. Although it is not clear whether chief Gray Lock was actually ever personally associated with this mountain, the name \\"Mount Greylock\\" first appeared in print around 1819, and came into popular use by the 1830s. There is a monument and plaque dedicated to Chief Gray Lock in Battery Park (Burlington, Vermont).

Some time later, Gosamaru left Nakijin for Zakimi, where he built Zakimi Castle; it is said he mobilized workers from as far away as the Amami Islands for this project, and that stones were moved by hand from Yamada Castle to build the new castle. For many years, Gosamaru served the kingdom loyally, and developed ties with the royal family, his daughter marrying King Sh≈ç Taiky≈´.

While not a chart success, the song drew attention to issues of racism in Australia through lyrics that encourage harmony and co-operation by people of all races. The song received national airplay and attention in 1986 when politically charged rockers and Powderworks Records founders Midnight Oil accompanied the band on a free concert tour of remote Aboriginal communities as the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \\"Ozzest 100\\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \\"Blackfella/Whitefella\\" was ranked number 82. Background Songwriter Neil Murray's inspiration for \\"Blackfella/Whitefella\\" came from his experience as a white man working in Papunya, a predominately Indigenous community north west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory from 1980. Although he was part of a minority, Murray found that in the isolated community, everybody was getting along, enjoying activities such as music and football. In 1985, after discussing the song and its message with band mates Sammy Butcher and George Rrurrambu, the later suggested that Murray include \\"yellafella\\" (a term sometimes used to refer to individuals of mixed race) in the lyrics, broadening the message of the song to include people from all places. Furthermore, in the music video to the song, when the term \\"yella fella\\" is used, Asian Australians are portrayed. In 1985 \\"Blackfella/Whitefella\\" appeared as the second track on Warumpi Band's debut album, Big Name, No Blankets on Parole Records and Powderworks Records. Other Media The single was included as an addition track on Australian and International 12\\" single releases of Midnight Oil's \\"The Dead Heart\\" released in July 1986. A 30-minute documentary film entitled Blackfella/Whitefella produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was released in 1987. The film inspired by the song showcases both Warumpi Band and Midnight Oil while touring together through Central Australia in 1986 and deals with both music and politics. In 2012, a children's book of the same name containing the song's lyrics accompanied by illustrations by Australian children was published by One Day Hill. Blackfella Whitefella is part of a series containing the lyrics of iconic songs which are intended to educate children on the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their struggle for recognition and equal rights. The book was launched by musician Archie Roach, with a percentage of book sales intended to support the Papunya community.

According to the film, the ban on DDT \\"...has needlessly resulted in the deaths of more than 40 million children and adults in the developing world.\\" No such \\"ban\\" actually exists.The DDT ban myth that will not die The film then continues to on a similar tack, arguing that climate legislation like cap and trade would negatively impact the life for middle and low-income families in America, particularly those working for energy-related jobs. The directors follow Tiffany McElhany and her family in rural Indiana, to see how fossil fuels have given them better opportunities.Not Evil Just Wrong, Contributors: Tiffany McElhany Production and reception=Funding= In 2008, McElhinney and McAleer raised almost $1 million (‚Ç¨799,000) from real estate investors, but said they needed a total of $4.5 million for a cinema release. After the film was turned down for funding by the Irish Film Board, the filmmakers then began taking donations online. The film failed to find a commercial distributor. =Production= The documentary has been noted for being a very similar style to Michael Moore's documentaries by using file footage of old movies, cartoons and class-based arguments. McAleer has been quoted saying, \\"I would not be making documentaries if it wasn't for Michael Moore,\\" he says. \\"He aroused my interest and people's interest in documentaries. He's also made it acceptable for people to go to the movie theatre and watch documentaries. I hate to say it but we're all children of Michael Moore.\\" =Reception= Mother Jones published a highly critical article on the movie. Stephanie Mencimer wrote that \\"The film is poorly organised and rehashes the familiar talking points of climate change sceptics ‚Äîglobal warming as bad science; climate concerns as hysteria akin to that over killer bees, etc. Pushing those views are the usual suspects, including Patrick Moore, the Greenpeace founder turned nuclear power lobbyist, and Thatcher-era British politician Nigel Lawson.\\" A premiere party was held by the Heritage Foundation, where it was also broadcast on Ustream and the American Family Association channel. \\"We may at last be getting our Michael Moore,\\" said Fred Smith, of the AFA, \\"A virtuous Michael Moore!\\"Washington Independent, Conservative Media Push Anti-Gore Documentary, October 14, 2009 Suzanne Fields from the Washington Times said, \\"Ann McElhinney's film focuses on people (not polar bears) whose paychecks and families are dependent on coal-generated energy, and whose interests are usually ignored in abstract statistics.\\"Washington Times, An Inconvenient Rebuttal, 22 October 2009 The Online Opinion, said that the movie excelled \\"in pointing to the absurdities and gross contradictions in the current scare over global warming.\\" Balanced Education for Everyone In 2010, the directors of Not Evil Just Wrong teamed up with the Independent Women's Forum to launch a Balanced Education for Everyone (B.E.E.), which promotes balanced education in public schools about climate science. The program suggests that if An Inconvenient Truth is shown in classrooms, then Not Evil Just Wrong should also be shown to offer students a broader curriculum about the climate debate. The directors also created an educational guide to teach about climate change, in conjunction with offering the free DVD to classrooms. Subsequent events Mother Jones subsequently reported that the husband of Tiffany McElhany, the Indiana women highlighted in the film as at risk of losing her standard of living should controls on carbon be enacted, was laid off from his job at a car parts plant. \\"It turns out that McElhany's story, too, is more complicated than Not Evil would have you believe. She is by far the documentary's most compelling character, and seems poised to become a minor heroine to the Tea Party crowd. Yet for all her talk of the bounty that coal has brought to Vevay, when I contacted her for this story she disclosed that her husband was laid off in March and has been unemployed ever since. It appears that a lot of dirty industry jobs have disappeared with no help at all from environmentalists.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2009 documentary films 2009 films Climate change denial Documentary films about global warming Documentary films about business English-language films Environmentally skeptical films Irish documentary films Irish films ","title":"Not Evil Just Wrong"},{"id":"23741273","text":"Alberta v Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 SCR 567 is a freedom of religion decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court addressed whether a requirement that all licensed drivers be photographed unconstitutionally violated the Hutterites' right to freedom of religion. Background The Hutterites believe that they cannot consent to being photographed. Previously, an exception had been made from the photograph requirement by the Alberta government. However, the government now keeps the photographs in a large database to prevent identity theft, and ended the exemption. Alberta claimed that making a constitutional exception for the Hutterites would undermine its attempts to prevent such fraud. The Alberta Court of Appeal found for the Hutterites. Opinion of the Court The Alberta government conceded that this was a violation of the Hutterites' religious freedom protected under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but argued this violation was allowable under section 1's \\"reasonable limits\\" on Charter rights. The Hutterites maintained that this was an unreasonable limit. Chief Justice McLachlin, writing for the majority, found the law constitutional. She found that the government's need to fight fraud was pressing, and that driving was not a right, so the government was entitled to attach legitimate conditions to it. Three justices dissented and would have not required the Hutterites to be photographed to be licensed. In three separate opinions, Justices Abella, LeBel and Fish found that this policy was not minimally impairing, since it would not significantly enable identity theft to allow the exceptions, and it would have a large detrimental effect on the Hutterites' way of life, since they would have to employ outsiders to perform all their necessary driving.

He was an important representative of constructivism. Gl√∂ckner was born in Cotta near Dresden. He attended the vocational school in Leipzig in 1903 and worked as a designer for textiles. From 1904 to 1911 he attended the evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Dresden, where he became friends with Kurt Fiedler.Hermann Gl√∂ckner ‚Äì Ein Patriarch der Moderne.

Berlin 1983 Among their lectures were Oskar Seyffert and Carl Rade, who later was a renowned professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and remained a friend of Gl√∂ckner for many years. Gl√∂ckner was mainly interested in drawings, but also in projections and geometry. From 1914 to 1918 he served in infantry divisions in France, Russia, and Poland. After World War I Gl√∂ckner earned some money with the copying of paintings for the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister.

The Nazis refused him any opportunities to exhibit and sell his paintings and graphics. So he turned to sgraffito to earn his living. Gl√∂ckner lost his home during Bombing of Dresden in World War II and moved to Loschwitz. Because of his formalist style, the officials of the GDR refused him the appreciation he deserved for a long time. His rehabilitation began with an exhibition of his graphical work in the Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden in 1969. In 1979 he received a permanent visa for the Federal Republic of Germany. Finally, in 1984, he was awarded with the National Prize of the GDR and the DEFA dedicated a film to him. Centrally in the area of the Technische Universit√§t Dresden he was allowed to erect a sculpture, which had been banned just a few years before. Another sculpture was erected one year later in the park of the Hotel Bellevue, Dresden's first address that time. In his later years Gl√∂ckner regularly visited West Berlin, where his cohabitee lived and where he died in 1987. Gl√∂ckner's urn was entombed in Loschwitz. A street in Loschwitz, newly built in 2008, is named after him. Works Gl√∂ckner made his works from objects he had on hand: twine, cardboard, match boxes, and wood scrapes.

The rook rifle, originally called the rook and rabbit rifle, is an obsolete English single-shot small calibre rifle intended for shooting small game, particularly rook shooting. Design The rook rifle was designed to be light enough to be carried for a walk in the country, accurate and powerful enough to take small game and usually elegant in balance, fit and finish. Almost always single shot, various actions were used including break-open actions, but the miniature Martini, a scaled-down version of the military Martini-Henry, was a favourite due to its strength and accuracy. The first rook rifles fired calibre bullets, although subsequently a number of cartridges were developed for this purpose ranging in calibre from and firing bullets at the usual black powder velocities of . History The rook rifle was developed in 1883 by the gun-makers Holland & Holland as a breech-loading equivalent of the muzzle-loading pea rifle. Holland & Holland made a particular specialty of producing rook rifles, reportedly selling around 5,000 of them in the late 1800s. Westley Richards and W.W. Greener were also noted for their rook rifles. Rook rifles were used extensively both in Britain and throughout the British Empire with large numbers being exported to many Commonwealth countries and colonial territories. The rise in popularity of the .22 Long Rifle cartridge in the United Kingdom spelled the end of the rook rifle and its cartridges; due to its combination of accuracy, lower noise, and economy, .22 LR superseded the various English centrefire rook rifle rounds in the early 1900s. Over the same period miniature rifle target shooting moved towards shorter ranges and indoor competitions, again being better suited to the .22 Long Rifle round. Due to the increasing scarcity of rook rifle cartridges, many rook rifles were converted to smoothbore shotguns, usually to .410 bores, and many others were sleeved down to calibre. Use As indicated by its name, the rook rifle's intended quarry was small game including rooks and rabbits. The rook tends to live in colonies known as rookeries, which over time grow and become nuisances in country areas. In rural Britain it was previously the practice to hold rook shoots where the juvenile birds, known as branchers, were shot before they were able to fly. These events were both very social and a source of food (the rook becomes inedible once mature) as the rook and rabbit pie was considered a great delicacy. Whilst usually limited to smaller game, the larger calibre cartridges are very capable for hunting larger game such as roe deer, smaller antelope and similar sized game.

Early life and education Nariman (Nari) Dossabhai Gandhi was born in 1934 in Surat to a Zoroastrian Parsi family from Bombay. He was one of the six children with three brothers and two sisters. Nari completed his schooling DDFF at St. Xavier's High School, Fort, Mumbai, and studied architecture at Sir J. J. College of Architecture, Mumbai for five years in the early 1950s. He travelled to US to apprentice with Frank Lloyd Wright at the Taliesin and spent five years there. After Wright's death in 1959, Nari left Taliesin and studied pottery at the Kent State University for two years. Career He also briefly worked for the American Architect Warren Weber. He was a good friend of Bruce Goff. Nari returned to India in the early 1960s. He taught at the M.S. University, Baroda and at the Academy of Architecture, Mumbai for a brief period. He passionately worked on as many as 30 projects over a period of as many years. He died in a tragic accident in 1993 near Khopoli, while he was on the way to one of his project sites at Kolgaon. While working in India, Nari continued to work on Wright's ideology of organic architecture and further developed his own unique style with a subtle influence of local climate and culture. He ceaselessly continued to work on Wright's idea of 'flowing space'. Nari worked without an office and rarely made any drawings for any of his projects. Nari spent a lot of time on his sites and worked closely with the craftsmen and often participated in the construction process himself. Personal life Nari lead a very simple life. He never married and had no children. He was a very religious man and believed in the Zoroastrian way of life. The simplicity of his life reflected in his work. The strong creative force behind his work also shaped the way he looked at ordinary things in life. In the later years of his life, Nari was greatly influenced by the ideas of the Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. He used to say that Silence and Void are synonyms of the word God. Insensitivity towards (his) work would disturb him. He used to get very angry at times. He often had disputes with his clients when they disregarded his ideas and works. He used to also get angry with the workers on his sites at times. It is very unfortunate that this aspect of Nari's life has attained more significance in people's minds rather than his creative genius. His work reflected more intrinsic element of nature, which affected consciously At Taliesin During the five years that Nari spent at Taliesin, he would spend more time working with his hands on stone and wood rather than on the drawing board. Nari left Taliesin with an ever-lasting mark, which is known amongst fellow apprentices as Nari's rock. The rock remembered after him is actually a huge boulder, which Nari had pulled down from a nearby hill and which, still stands today near the entrance to the Taliesin. Architectural style Nariman Dossabhai Gandhi's ideologies and works were in sharp contrast to the mainstream architectural thinking. His works display a distinctive organic character. They appear to have evolved as a response to the context, remaining strongly rooted to the site and being very well connected to the surroundings. Nari's works display highly skilled craftsmanship and structural ingenuity. He has stacked earthen pots to construct arches out of them and built stairs out of brick arches. Throughout his works you see extraordinary use of stone, brick, wood, glass and leather. Nari Gandhi rejected conventional ideas and paradigms and introduced his own through his work. Through his work, he started 'rethinking' about standardised practices and set up his own. When you visit any one of his houses, you will notice an evident 're-thinking' of the arrangement of various functions within the house. Each building designed by Nari is as an example of unconventional thinking in architecture. He created built spaces that remained forever connected to their un-built surroundings allowing sunlight and wind to interact with the inside and animate the space with time. Each house is a series of dialogues between the built and the un- built.

Activism Gray operated the Drop Inn Center in Over-the-Rhine, which provided food, clothing, and shelter but not conventional treatment for homeless alcoholics.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 105. Around the late 1970s he emerged as the leader for the rights of the poor in Over-the-Rhine, spending much of his life fighting historic preservationists who wanted to save Over-the-Rhine's deteriorating nineteenth century architecture. Gray believed preserving the buildings would lead to gentrification, which would involuntarily uproot the poor and push them out of their homes and neighborhood.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 84. Gray believed that regardless of what the city government and preservationists said they ultimately wanted to run his homeless shelter out of Over-the-Rhine and turn it into an \\"artsy- craftsy\\" neighborhood. He was not against preservation when it benefited the poor, as he was known to protest demolitions, some with acts of civil disobedience. =National Register controversy= In 1980, at the public hearing for Over-the-Rhine's nomination into the National Register of Historic Places, Gray rallied some 250 protesters to the event where he blasted urban renewal as \\"negro removal.\\"Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 113. There gray and his allies were able to force a three-year delay on the Register's decision.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 115.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 128. In 1983 gray used powerful political allies to lobby the National Register's board members, which resulted in Over-the-Rhine being rejected from the Register by a narrow 8 to 7 vote.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 132. However, preservationists appealed the board's decision to the keeper of the National Register,Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 135. Carol Shull, who favored adding Over-the-Rhine to the Register. Despite several last-minute derailment attempts by gray, Over-the-Rhine was added to the National Register in May 1983.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 136. =Low-income housing in Over-the- Rhine= Gray, having lost the National Register battle, vowed to make the expansion of low-income housing in Over-the-Rhine his top priority.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 148. In 1985 gray pushed an \\"urban renewal plan\\"Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 169. through city council that he presented as \\"a compromise\\" that would allow some upper-income residents to settle in Over- the-Rhine. However, the plan made additional low-income housing such a high priority that it was not likely to yield much mixed-income residential or commercial development.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 151. The main critic of the plan was Jim Tarbell, an Over-the-Rhine resident and entrepreneur, who after 1983 would emerge as the leading opponent of Buddy Gray. Tarbell wanted to help the poor who cared, but believed social activists like gray were \\"naively sympathetic\\" to the \\"sloppy people\\" who \\"threw garbage out of windows, played loud music night and day, got drunk in the street, and let small children roam the streets unattended.\\"Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 141. Gray, on the other hand, assumed the poor had chosen a lifestyle of poverty, and for that reason should be separated from others who had not chosen a similar lifestyle.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 153. Tarbell rejected that view and argued that the 1985 plan denied the poor ready access to alternative lifestyles. No one seriously challenged gray's 1985 plan until 1992 when Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) noted the plan did not yield balance in the composition of Over-the-Rhine's population, nor did it produce any significant commercial and industrial development in the area.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 159.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 160. HOME argued Over- the-Rhine was on path to become a \\"permanent low income, one-race ghetto--a stagnant, decaying 'reservation' for the poor at the doorstep to downtown.\\" Furthermore, HOME strongly challenged gray's assertion that the poor had all chosen their lifestyle, arguing that some wanted to move up the socioeconomic ladder.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 161. In 1993 Over-the-Rhine's housing policy was changed after several small-business owners filed a lawsuit, calling the policy \\"racial and economic segregation.\\"Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 214. The city settled out of court and agreed to set aside money for non- subsidized housing. =Urban Land Institute Study= In 1996, the city invited the Urban Land Institute (ULI) to study Over-the-Rhine and create a plan for revitalization. ULI recommended the creation of a bi-partisan \\"Over-the-Rhine Coalition\\" to reach compromise between the polarized, deadlocked neighborhood factions. Gray refused to participate in the coalition unless specific demands were met, believing the city-funded ULI study was meant to derail his efforts to preserve low-income housing in the neighborhood. ULI panelists questioned whether Gray had too much power over City Hall, and asked the city to question whether they should continue to fund gray--whom they considered \\"an impediment to revitalization.\\" Later that year, near a critical point in negotiations, Buddy Gray was shot to death by a mentally-ill homeless man whom he had helped. After gray's murder his allies were not able to recreate his leadership, and the Over-the-Rhine Coalition was formed. Death On November 15, 1996, Wilbur Worthen, a mentally-ill homeless man, whom Buddy Gray had helped, shot Gray to death in his office at the Drop Inn Center. The man claimed Gray had been pumping poisonous gas into his apartment. Rumors spread among Gray's supporters that he was assassinated,Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 166. but police were unable to find a connection between the shooter and a recent anti-Gray pamphlet and phone campaign.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 167. Worthen was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and sentenced to a psychiatric facility. Legacy Gray's legacy lived on through the Drop Inn Center and ReSTOC, his low-income housing cooperative. ReSTOC was one of the neighborhood's largest property owners, and at one point owned 71 parcels in Over-the-Rhine.iRhine.com, ReSTOC's FATE . Accessed on 2010-07-29. However, the non-profit had trouble keeping up with the cost and work needed to maintain all of their properties. According to former mayor Charlie Luken in 2001, ReSTOC \\"are the owners of the most blight in Over-the-Rhine. Period.\\" Critics of ReSTOC accused the nonprofit of stockpiling properties in order to prevent redevelopment. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that despite receiving millions of dollars from federal, state, and local governments to develop low- income housing ReSTOC \\"actually reduced the number of occupied apartments.\\" In 2002 the city forced ReSTOC to sell some of its properties and use funds from those sales to maintain and improve the other properties it owned. ReSTOC later merged with another nonprofit, Over-the-Rhine Housing Network, to form Over-the-Rhine Community Housing. NotesReferences * Miller, Zane L.; Tucker, Bruce (1999).

Description The cross is an important example of an 11th-century memorial Celtic cross and is believed to commemorate the brother of Hywel ab Edwin, Maredudd ab Edwin of Deheubarth, who died in 1035. The brothers were joint rulers of Deheubarth, and the cross is thought to date from around the time of Maredudd's death. It was first known to be placed in Carew, Pembrokeshire, from around 1690. The previous location for the stone is unknown. It is suspected that when it was moved to Carew, it was as ornamentation for nearby Carew Castle. The damage to the cross, where part of the stone has flaked away, occurred prior to 1690. In 1811, the cross stood on a low plinth.Fenton (1903): p. 132 The plinth was altered around 15 years later to align it with the newly lowered road. The top stone became dislodged in 1844, and it was re-set in the slot with lead. The cross was moved away from the road in 1925, and again during the Second World War, when it was relocated to the nearby castle for protection. Following the war, it was placed back by the roadside, but on at a new position. The monument was Grade I listed on 14 May 1970; the reason description given was \\"Listed grade I as a characteristically Welsh composite cross and one of the finest early Christian monuments in Wales.\\" It was the Carew Cross that inspired the symbol of Cadw. Description It is similar in design to the cross at Nevern. It is inscribed, on the west face \\"MARGIT EUT REX ETG [uin] FILIUS\\" and otherwise decorated in abstract patterns. The cross is tall and is in two parts, joined by a tenon joint. The top is Carmarthenshire sandstone and the lower portion is igneous-type stone from Preseli.

The accession of the King of France to the royal throne was legitimized by a ceremony performed with the Crown of Charlemagne at Notre-Dame de Reims. In late medieval and early modern times, the new king did not need to be anointed in order to be recognized as French monarch but ascended upon the previous monarch's death with the proclamation \\"Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi!\\" The most important part of the French ceremony was not the coronation itself, but the Sacre ‚Äì the anointing or unction of the king. The Carolingian king Pepin the Short was anointed in Soissons (752) to legitimize the accession of the new dynasty. A second anointing of Pepin by Pope Stephen II took place at the Basilica of St Denis in 754, the first to be performed by a Pope. The unction served as a reminder of the baptism of king Clovis I in Reims by archbishop Saint Remi in 496/499, where the ceremony was finally transferred in 816 and completed with the use of the Holy Ampulla found in 869 in the grave of the Saint. Since this Roman glass vial containing the balm due to be mixed with chrism, was allegedly brought by the dove of the Holy Spirit, the French monarchs claimed to receive their power by divine right. Out of respect for the miraculous oil, the king's shirt and the gloves put on after the unction of the hands were burned after the ceremony.Patrick Demouy, Le sacre du roi, Strasbourg, 2016, √©d. La Nu√©e Bleue, . Exceptionally, the shirt worn by Louis XV was not burned. The shirt was donated to the King of Portugal, John V, and is today at the National Palace of Mafra, guarded by the Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra The coronation regalia like the throne and sceptre of Dagobert I or crown and sword of Charlemagne were kept in the Basilica of Saint-Denis near Paris and the liturgical instruments in Reims like the Holy Ampulla and Chalice, where they are still partly preserved as well as in the Louvre and other Parisians museums. The Holy Ampulla was kept in a reliquary in the form of a round gold plaque thickly set with jewels in the center of which was a white enamelled representation of the dove of the Holy Spirit, upright with the wings open and pointing down, of which the Holy Ampulla itself formed the body. The reliquary had a heavy chain by which it could be worn around the neck of the abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Remi (where it was normally kept) when he brought it, walking barefoot at the head of a procession of his monks under a canopy carried by four noblemen on horseback, the Hostages of the Holy Ampulla, from the Abbey to the very steps of the high altar of the Cathedral, where he turned the relic over to the Archbishop of Rheims for its use in the coronation ritual. All succeeding Kings of France were anointed with this same oil‚Äîmixed with chrism prior to their coronation. French queens were crowned either together with their husband at Reims or alone at Sainte-Chapelle or Abbey of St. Denis. The participants in the coronation The king was crowned by the Archbishop of Reims who was assisted by four suffragan bishops of his ecclesiastical province, and of the Bishop of Langres and Chapter of the Cathedral of Reims. The established order of six bishops was: *The Archbishop of Reims anointed and crowned the king. *The Bishop of Laon carried the holy ampulla. *The Bishop of Langres carried the scepter. *The Bishop of Beauvais carried and showed the coat of arms or royal mantle. *The Bishop of Chalons carried the royal ring. *The Bishop of Noyon carried the belt. To these were added the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Remi, guardian of the holy ampulla, and the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, guardian of other regalia. Peers are cited for the first time in 1203 (first convocation) and 1226. However, their first recorded participation in the coronation is made on the occasion of the coronation of Philip V of France on 9 January 1317. These are the six aforementioned ecclesiastical peers and the six lay peers (the great vassals of the King of France, in the modern era of royal princes or lords). In order of protocol, the six lay peers are: *The Duke of Burgundy carried the royal crown, girded the king's sword, and gave him the order of chivalry. *The Duke of Normandy carried the first square banner. *The Duke of Aquitaine (or Guyenne, in texts, which is the same) carried the second square banner. *The Count of Toulouse carried the spurs. *The Count of Flanders carried the royal sword. *The Count of Champagne carried the banner of war. The spiritual peerages were perpetual, and were never extinguished during the existence of the Kingdom of France. But as early as 1204, the roster of the lay peerages had been incomplete. Normandy had been absorbed into the French crown (1204); Toulouse in 1271, Champagne in 1284. Aquitaine was several times forfeited and restored, Burgundy became extinct in 1361 and again in 1477, and Flanders was ceded to the Empire in 1531. Hence, more often than not, princes of the royal blood and high-ranking members of the nobility acted as representatives of the ancient lay peerages. Spiritual peers were also represented if their see is vacant or they are unable to attend (such as the bishops of Langres, Noyon and Beauvais, who were enemies of Charles VII during the Hundred Years' War). Coronation sites After the first two kings of the House of Capet had been consecrated elsewhere (Hugh Capet in the cathedral of Noyon, Robert II in Orl√©ans, both in 987), subsequent ceremonies were held at Reims Cathedral, beginning in 1027. However, there were a few notable exceptions: *Louis VI was consecrated on August 3, 1108, at Orl√©ans Cathedral. He was anointed by Daimbert, the Archbishop of Sens. He feared that his half-brother, Philip, Count of Mantes, would prevent his access to Reims. The Archbishop of Reims contested the coronation, which should have been his place by custom, but to no avail; the choice of the coronation site and the participants was deemed to be a prerogative of the crown. *John the Posthumous, son of Louis X, who was born King of France but died a few days later, was never consecrated. *Henry of Navarre was consecrated King of France as Henry IV on February 27, 1594, at Chartres Cathedral. Reims was then held by his enemies, the House of Guise and the Catholic League. *After the French Revolution, Louis XVIII decided to dispense with a consecration. His successor, Charles X however revived the consecration at Reims and was the last king to be anointed there. On December 16, 1431, Henry VI of England let himself be crowned as King of France at Notre Dame de Paris, according to a ritual similar to that established by his great-grandfather Charles V of France. This was an attempt to counter the coronation of Henry's uncle and rival, Charles VII of France, who had been consecrated at Reims in 1429. The French Sacre from 1364 to 1825 (Charles V to Charles X) Like the English coronation ritual, the French ritual after being subject to considerable influence from the Roman ritual in the 12th and 13th centuries reverted to earlier French forms in the 14th century. The Roman text and ritual, however, were not completely abandoned but combined with the earlier texts and ritual so that this fourth and final recension was nearly twice the length of the earlier recension.The following account is based on that given in Coronation Rites by Reginald D. Maxwell Woolley, B.D. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1915 and from \\"Pertinent Extracts from the Ceremony of the Sacre\\" in The Legend of the Ste. Ampoule by Sir Francis Oppenheimer, K.C., M.G., London: Faber & Faber Limited, 24 Russell Square. The king spends the night before his Sacre at the Palace of Tau and is awakened in the morning by the clergy and officials involved in the coronation ritual. They assist in dressing the king for the Sacre and the king then chooses which of his nobles will serve as the Hostages for the Sainte Ampoule and the clergy, as well, also swear to return the Sainte Ampoule to the Abbey of St. Remi after the Sacre. The king enters Reims Cathedral after the singing of the canonical hour of Prime. At the king's entrance into the cathedral a prayer is said and, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the hymn 'Veni Creator Spiritus' is sung. Upon his entrance into the choir the prayer, \\"God, the Ruler of heaven and earth, etc.\\" is said and Terce is sung as the abbot and monks of the Abbey of Saint- Remi come in procession bringing the Sainte Ampoule in its reliquary hanging by it chain around the abbot's neck while four monks in alb bear a silk canopy over him. Upon arriving at the entrance of the cathedral the Archbishop of Reims and the other archbishops and bishops present solemnly swear to return the Sainte Ampoule to them after the Sacre. Then the abbot and monks enter the cathedral and proceed to the altar, everyone bowing reverently as they pass before them. The coronation proper begins with the bishops' petition that the traditional rights of the Church be maintained and the king's reply, followed by the king's taking of the coronation oath,From 1364 to 1484, this contained a clause in which the king promised to main the rights of the French Crown (i.e., against English claims to the throne of France) in the Bourbon era on the Reims Gospel. Then the Recognition takes place followed by the singing of the Te Deum. Then the prayer, \\"Inscrutable God, etc.\\" is and then the buskins and spurs are placed upon the king's feet and his invested and gird with the Coronation Sword, Joyeuse, with the formula \\"Accept this sword from our hands, etc.\\" Then the antiphon: \\"I was glad when they said to me, let us go into the house of the Lord\\" (Psalm 122:1). The king removes his coat and other outerwear and the special silver latchets on his silk shirt are opened to expose his chest, upper back and the joints of his arms. While special versicle and response and a collect (unique to the French rite) are said, a paten with Chrism on it is place on the altar, the Abbot of St. Remi presents the Saint Ampoule to the Archbishop, who with a small golden stylus removes a small particle from the contents of the Sainte Ampoule and carefully mixes it with the Chrism on the paten. The king kneels while the Litany of the Saints is chanted by two archbishops or bishops, concluding with two prayers. The Archbishop then says the formal prayer of consecration: > God eternal, All powerful, Creator and Governor of the Heavens and the > Earth, Maker and Disposer of angels and of men, King of Kings, Lord of > Lords, Thou who madest Abraham Thy faithful servant to triumph over his > enemies, who hast raised to the highest in the Kingdom David, Thy humble > servant, and hast delivered him out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the > paw of the beast, and likewise from Goliath, and from the malicious sword of > Saul, and from all his enemies, and has enriched Solomon with the wondrous > gift of wisdom and of peace, forgive and accept our humble prayers, and > multiply the gifts of Thy blessings on this Thy servant, who with all humble > devotion, we, with one accord, choose for King, and we beseech Thee > encompass him evermore, and in all places with the right hand of Thy power, > so that strengthened by the fidelity of Abraham, possessed of the patience > of Joshua, inspired with the humility of David, adorned with the wisdom of > Solomon, he may be to Thee ever pleasing, and walk evermore without offence > in the way of justice, and henceforth in such wise succour, direct, guard > and uplift the church of the whole kingdom, and the people belonging > thereto, may he administer with puissance and right royally the rule of Thy > power against all enemies visible and invisible, may he not abandon his > rights over the kingdoms of the Franks, the Burgundians, and of Aquitania, > but aided by Thee inspire them with their sometime loyalty so that made glad > by the fidelity of all his people, and provided with the helmet of Thy > protection, and ever guarded with the invincible buckler, and compassed > about with the celestial armies, he may happily triumph over his enemies, > cause the infidel to fear his power, and with joy bring peace to those who > fight under Thy banner. Adorn him by many a gracious blessing, with the > virtues with the which Thou hast enriched Thy faithful ones aforesaid, > counsel him richly in the government of the kingdom, and anoint him > plenteously with the grace of the Holy Spirit, etc.Oppenheimer. Translation > by Mrs. Kemp-Welsh. The Archbishop, sitting, then anoints the king with the Chrism in the form of a cross on the top of the head, on the breast, between the shoulders, on both shoulders and on the joints of both arms, each time saying: > I anoint thee king with holy oil in the name of the Father, and of the Son, > and of the Holy Spirit. And all, within the sound of his voice, each time respond: \\"Amen\\". While this anointing was taking place the choir sang the Antiphon: > Zadok the priest and the prophet Nathan anointed Solomon King in Jerusalem, > and did proclaim this right joyfully, saying, May the king live forever. The Archbishop then said these prayers: > God Almighty anoint Thou this king to the government, as Thou hast anointed > those priests, and kings and prophets and martyrs, who by faith have subdued > kingdoms, exercised justice, and obtained the promises. May this Thy most > holy unction fall upon his head, descend within, and penetrate even unto his > very heart, and may he by Thy grace be made worthy of the promises, the > which the most famous kings have obtained, so that in all happiness he may > reign in this present life, and may be one with them in Thy heavenly > kingdom, for the sake of our Saviour Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who was anointed > with the oil of gladness above his fellows, and by virtue of the cross has > triumphed over the powers of the air, and has destroyed Hell, and vanquished > the kingdom of the Evil One, and is ascended into Heaven as conqueror, to > whom belongs all victory and glory and power, and who lives with Thee, and > reigns in unity with Thee and the Holy Spirit to all eternity. > O God, the Strength of the Elect, and the uplifter of the humble,who in the > beginning didst punish the world with a flood of waters, and didst make > known by the dove carrying the bough of olive, that peace was yet anew > restored to the earth, and hast with the holy anointing oil consecrate as > priest Aaron Thy servant, and by the infusion of this unction hast appointed > the priests and kings and prophets to govern the people of Israel, and hast > by the prophetic voice of Thy Servant David foretold that with oil should > the face of the church be made to shine, so we pray Thee, all-powerful > Father, that Thy good pleasure may be sanctified in the blessing of this Thy > servant with the oil of this heavenly dove, so that he may bring as did the > dove of old, peace to the people committed to his charge. May he follow with > diligence the example of Aaron in the service of God, and may he ever attain > in his judgments to all that is most excellent in wisdom and equity and with > Thy aid, and by the oil of this unction, make him to bring joy to all his > people through Jesus Christ our Lord. > May Jesus Christ our Lord and God, and Son of God, who by the Father was > anointed with the oil of gladness above all others who are one with Him, by > this present infusion of the sacred unction pour upon thy head the blessing > of the Holy Spirit, and make it go even unto the innermost recesses of thy > heart, so that thou canst by this visible and material gift, perceive the > things invisible, and after having with right moderation accomplished the > temporal kingdom, mayest thou reign with Him eternally for the sake of Jesus > Christ our Saviour. Then the Archbishop and the assisting priests and deacons close the silver latchets of the king's shirt which opened for the anointing. After this, the king, standing up, was vested in the tunicle, dalmatic and royal mantle, all of 'azure blue' velvet sprinkled with fleurs-de-lys of gold, representing the three Catholic orders of subdeacon, deacon and priest.Oppenheimer only mentions the dalmatic and royal mantle. by the Grand Chamberlain of France. Kneeling again, the king was anointed in the palms of both hands by the Archbishop, who recited the formula Unguantur manus istae, as follows: > Be those hands anointed with sanctified oil, as kings and prophets were > anointed, and as Samuel anointed David king, so that you be blessed and > constituted king in this kingdom, that the Lord your God gave you to rule > and govern. This may He vouchsafe to grant, Who lives and reigns God, with > the Father and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Thereafter the Archbishop concluded the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting the prayer Deus, qui es iustorum gloria. After this the royal gloves are blessed with two prayers (adapted from those used to bless those of a bishop) and are placed upon the king's hands. Then the ring is blessed with the prayer \\"Bless, O Lord, and sanctify this ring, etc.\\" and placed upon the king's hand with the original French formula, \\"Receive the ring, etc.\\" and the prayer \\"God to whom belongs all power, etc.\\" Then the scepter is placed into his right hand with the formula \\"Receive the scepter, the sign of kingly power, etc.\\" and the prayer \\"Lord, the fount of all good things, etc.\\" and the Hand of Justice in his left hand with the form \\"Receive the Rod of virtue and equity, etc.\\" Then the peers were summoned by name to come near and assist. The Archbishop of Reims took the Crown of Charlemagne from the altar and says the forms \\"God crown thee with a crown of glory, etc.\\", \\"Receive this crown, etc.\\" (a conflation of the old French and the Roman forms) and set it on the king's head, while the other eleven peers touched it with their right hands. Immediately after the Coronation, the Archbishop recited the prayer Deus perpetuitatis: \\"God of eternity, the Commander of all powers, etc.\\" The Archbishop then says a number of blessings (all of them also found in other coronation rites). After this, the king was lifted up into his throne on the rood screen by the lay peers, as the Archbishop said the words \\"Stand fast and hold firm the place, etc.\\" and as the choir sings the antiphon: > Let thy hand be strengthened and your right hand exalted. Let justice and > judgment be the preparation of thy Seat and mercy and truth go before thy > face The Archbishop says the prayer \\"God, who gave to Moses victory, etc.\\" and kisses the king with the words \\"May the king live forever\\" and his cry is taken up by the peers and all the people present as they acknowledged him as their duly anointed, crowned and enthroned king. Mass is then said, with the collect \\"God, who didst visit those who are humble, etc.\\", the Epistle is Lev. 26:6-9 and the Gospel is Matthew 22:15-22, the king receiving Holy Communion under both species (bread and wine). At the conclusion of the Mass the Oriflamme is blessed. The king's return to Paris and his Joyous Entry into the capital through the gate facing the Abbey of St. Denis (i.e., the same exit by which his corpse would later be brought for burial in the same abbey church) completed the inauguration of the French king = Coronation of the heir = Philip, son of King Louis VII of France, as junior king During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France chose to have their heirs apparent crowned during their own lifetime in order to avoid succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England and Kings of Hungary. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and were not included in the numbering of monarchs. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute. The last heir apparent to the French throne to be crowned during his father's lifetime was the future Philip II of France. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger.  Imperial ceremony  Coronation of Emperor Napoleon I of France at Notre-Dame de Paris. Napoleon crowned himself as \\"Emperor of the French\\" during this ceremony, then crowned his consort Josephine as Empress. During the First French Empire, Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Josephine were crowned in December 1804 in an extremely elaborate ritual presided over by Pope Pius VII and conducted at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The pope and prelates entered Notre Dame in procession, followed by Napoleon and Jos√©phine with the Imperial Regalia preceding them. The regalia were placed on the altar and blessed by the pope, who then seated himself upon a throne to the left of the altar. Following this Napoleon was anointed by the pontiff three times on the head and hands, with the new emperor reportedly yawning several times during this act and the remainder of the ceremony. The high point of the ceremony came when Napoleon advanced to the altar, took the crown and placed it upon his own head. Replacing this with a laurel wreath of gold made in the ancient Roman style, he then crowned his wife, who knelt before him. Six months later, Napoleon was crowned King of Italy at Milan with the Iron Crown of Lombardy. Emperor Napoleon III chose not to have a coronation ceremony. Nevertheless, to celebrate the Exposition Universelle in 1855, the Crown of Napoleon III is fabricated, but destroyed in 1887, and a small consort's crown was fabricated for his wife, Empress Eugenie, which remains in the possession of the French government.  Extinction of the ceremony  In 1825, Charles X became the last French King to be crowned at Reims. The last French royal coronation was that of Charles X, in 1825 by Jean-Baptiste de Latil in Rheims cathedral. Charles' decision to be crowned, in contrast to his predecessor, Louis XVIII, proved unpopular with the French public, and Charles was ultimately overthrown in a revolution in 1830. His successor, Louis Philippe, opted not to have a coronation. The French government broke up and sold off most of the French Crown Jewels after 1875, in hopes of avoiding any further royalist agitation against the newly restored republic.

Mission The 497th Group delivers real-time high- confidence intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products and services to Joint and Coalition forces and other designated government agencies. The Group consists of four active duty Squadrons, the 497th Operations Support Squadron, the 45th Intelligence Squadron, the 30th Intelligence Squadron and 10th Intelligence Squadron, one Air National Guard unit, the 192nd Intelligence Squadron (VA ANG), and a new classic Air Reserve unit, the 718th Intelligence Squadron, stood up to support the total force integration of the Wing and combat ISR operations. History=Background= In 1951, United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) recognized its need for a reconnaissance technical squadron in the European theater to process and produce aerial reconnaissance materials, interpret photographic reconnaissance interpretation, and to compile and reproduce aeronautical charts and related products. Therefore, it activated the 497th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany on 3 May 1951. However, USAFE lacked resources in theater to train and man the unit, so the 497th Squadron moved to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, the home of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in July 1951.Lent. p. 32 After the completion of training, the squadron sailed on the for Europe, where it was stationed at sites in Wiesbaden while its base at the Schierstein Administrative Office was being renovated. By the end of April, the unit moved to Schierstein. On 6 June 1966, USAFE transferred the personnel of its Directorate of Air Targets to the squadron, which became the \\"USAFE Intelligence Research Center.\\" With the increased mission, the Air Force decided to inactivate the 497th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, and on 1 October 1967, it organized the 497th Reconnaissance Technical Group, which assumed the personnel, equipment and expanded mission of the 497th Squadron. =United States Air Forces Europe intelligence support= The 497th Reconnaissance Technical Group provided intelligence support to flying units in Europe during the Cold War. In September 1968, the group assumed a joint intelligence role when the Army incorporated personnel into the 497th. The next year, USAFE moved to Ramstein Air Base while the group remained at Schierstein. With the move, the unit stopped producing charts and maps but assumed operational control of the photographic processing facility at Wiesbaden Air Base. Marine Corps personnel were added to the group in 1978, and a micrographics production capability was added as well. In the Spring of 1979, the Air Force activated an Operating Location of the group at Ramstein Air Base to provide expanded imagery intelligence support to Headquarters, USAFE. The group accomplished photographic intelligence exploitation including studies, analysis and estimates as well as precision targeting, plotting and production. Ity also staffed and supported the USAFE Intelligence Development Center and processed and interpreted reconnaissance imagery for the commander of United States European Command and North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Command Europe, and specified U.S. intelligence agencies. In 1982, the 496th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, based at RAF Alconbury, was activated and assigned to the group. It provided imagery services to Air Force units in the United Kingdom and served as a backup to the group's main operating location. In September 1989, the group detachment at Ramstein became a squadron, the 495th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron.Lent, pp. 30, 32-33 The Group provided intelligence imagery products during the build-up and execution of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On 1 July 1991, the group moved to RAF Molesworth, United Kingdom, where it served as the foundation for European Command's Joint Analysis Center. With the fall of the Soviet Union and withdrawal of Russian forces from Eastern Europe, the Air Force inactivated the group on 1 July 1992.Lent, p. 33 =Air Intelligence Agency support= The Air Force redesignated the group as the 497th Intelligence Group and activated it at Bolling Air Force Base, District of Columbia on 1 October 1993 as part of Air Intelligence Agency. The group's mission included three main functions: intelligence systems, operations applications, and security and communications management. As the Air Force developed its doctrine for information superiority and information operations, the 497th was redesignated the 497th Information Operations Group on 1 August 2000. The group was the primary planning, policy implementation, and functional management arm of the Directorate of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissanceof Headquarters, United States Air Force. The unit also supported a number of Air Staff offices, and other united States Department of Defense and joint customers around the world. Its provided intelligence infrastructure services and security, weapons system support, automation, and information operations support to users worldwide. It contributed to development of intelligence support infrastructure requirements for weapons systems. The group inactivated on 1 February 2001. =Air Combat Command= The group returned to its former name as the 497th Intelligence Group and was activated at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia on 1 December 2008. The 10th and 30th Intelligence Squadrons were assigned to the group. On 1 January 2009, the unit was again redesignated, this time as the 497th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group. Prior to the establishment of the 480th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group, the 497th's 31st Intelligence Squadron performed duties as the Air Force component supporting the National Security Agency Central Security Service-Georgia operations site. The 497th operates a $750 million Distributed Common Ground System AN/GSQ-272 weapons system, commonly referred to as the Distributed Ground System-1 (DGS-1) or \\"Sentinel-1\\". The DGS-1 infrastructure includes analytical and reporting elements for imagery and signals intelligence obtained through Lockheed U-2 Dragon Lady, General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, and Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance platforms. It provides \\"all source\\" analysis and fusion, via the Distributed Common Ground System analysis and reporting team. The group now provides real-time tactical and national intelligence collection, exploitation, analysis, and reporting operations providing imagery, full motion video, and cryptologic intelligence to United States Central Command, United States Southern Command and United States European Command combat operations, plans, and forces. The group also has two associate units from the reserve elements, the 192d Intelligence Squadron of the Virginia Air National Guard and the 718th Intelligence Squadron of Air Force Reserve Command. While these two units are not assigned to the group, they work alongside the group's personnel and operate the same equipment.

It transferred, without personnel and equipment, to England on 7 July 1943 and assigned to Eighth AF. The group used Supermarine Spitfires and Stinson L-5s to obtain information about bombardment targets and damage inflicted by bombardment operations; provide mapping service for air and ground units; observe and report on enemy transportation, installations, and positions; and obtain data on weather conditions. Prior to June 1944, the group photographed airfields, cities, industrial establishments, and ports in France, the Low Countries, and Germany. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for operations during the period 31 May ‚Äì 30 June 1944, when its coverage of bridges, marshalling yards, canals, highways, rivers, and other targets contributed much to the success of the Normandy campaign. The unit covered missile sites in France during July, and in August carried out photographic mapping missions for ground forces advancing across France. It provided reconnaissance support for the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September and for the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944‚Äì January 1945.

The group was first activated during World War II as the 11th Photographic Group when the 1st Photographic Charting Group was expanded into two groups in 1943. Although its headquarters remained in the United States, squadrons and detachments of the group served in most combat theaters. It was disbanded in 1944, when its elements and other reconnaissance units were consolidated under the 311th Photographic Wing. Mission The 361 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group supports Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and provides analytical and targeting support to the rest of the Air Force. The group provides threat warning and enhances situational awareness to AFSOC aircrews across the spectrum of operations from conflict through humanitarian relief. The group and subordinate units conduct cultural and network studies to enhance tactics and ensure interoperability within the special operations community and conduct research and development of communications sites. The group's airmen act as aircrew on almost every aircraft type within AFSOC. History=World War II= The 361 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group was activated as the 11th Photographic Group (Mapping) at Reading Army Air Field, Pennsylvania in December 1943. Its original squadrons were the 1st and 19th Photographic Charting Squadrons at Bradley Field, Connecticut and the 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron at MacDill Field, Florida. All three squadrons were transferred from the 1st Photographic Charting Group at Bolling Field, in the District of Columbia. However, one flight of the 19th Squadron was deployed to Mexico City until 20 December.

The squadron remained in Egypt for the rest of the time it was assigned to the 11th Group. In April 1944, the 3d Squadron moved to Smoky Hill Army Air Field, Kansas, where it began to train with the Boeing F-13 Superfortress in preparation for its September move to Saipan where it began performing long range reconnaissance missions for Twentieth Air Force, although it was still assigned to the 11th. The group's early missions included the photographic mapping of the United States and sending detachments to the Chine-Burma-India Theater, the Near and Middle East, Mexico, Canada, Alaska, and the Caribbean to conduct similar missions. It was disbanded on 5 October 1944 and its component squadrons transferred directly to the 311th Photographic Wing. =Intelligence operations= The Air Force reconstituted group as the 361st Tactical Intelligence Group on 31 July 1985, but did not activate it. The group was renamed the 361st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group in October 2008 and on 29 October, the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency activated the group at Hurlburt Field, Florida.

Early life Michael Hicks (or Hickes) born 21 October 1543, was eldest son of Robert Hicks of Bristol, Gloucestershire, at one time a London merchant. His mother was Julian(a), daughter and heiress of William Arthur of Somerset. His younger brother Baptist was created Viscount Campden. Michael matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1559 and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1564. Career Joining the household of Sir William Cecil, the future Lord Burghley, he rose to become one of Burghley's two principal secretaries at the time he was the Queen's chief minister. Taking the same position with Sir Robert Cecil after Burghley's death, Hicks became an influential figure at court and appears to have been popular. Kimber & Johnson (1771) state that he \\"by his ingenious education and good parts, became very polite and agreeable and was admitted into a society of learned and eminent persons, having the accomplishment of a facetious wit to recommend him\\", but also that \\"many persons, knowing what interest he had with Sir Robert ... made him their friend, at any rate, to solicit their causes with him, who was ever... ready to gratify Sir Michael, especially where benefit was likely to accrue to him\\". Hicks appeared to have possessed considerable financial abilities, and his personal friends sought his aid and counsel in their pecuniary difficulties. He lent Francis Bacon money in 1593, and between that year and 1608 Bacon sent him several appeals for further loans. Hicks proved a very friendly creditor. Bacon invariably wrote to him in amicable terms, and urged him to preserve good relations between himself and Sir Robert Cecil. To Fulke Greville, another friend, Hicks also rendered similar services. He became wealthy enough to purchase two estates, Beverstone in Gloucestershire and Ruckholt in Leyton, Essex. The latter, which he acquired of a stepson about 1598, he made his chief home.Hicks's house at Ruckholt was demolished in 1757 . In June 1604 he was granted the site and demesne of the priory of Lenton, Nottinghamshire. On 16 June 1604 Hicks entertained James I at Ruckholt, and on 6 August the king knighted him at Theobalds. He died at Ruckholt 15 August 1612, and was buried in the chancel of the neighbouring church of Leyton, where an elaborate monument in alabaster, with recumbent figures of himself (in full armour) and of his widow, was erected to his memory. Hicks was an MP in every Parliament but one between 1585 and his death, representing Truro (1584), Shaftesbury (1588‚Äì89 and 1593), Gatton (1597‚Äì98) and Horsham (1601 and 1604‚Äì1611). On 17 May 1603 Hicks became Receiver-General for the county of Middlesex, but seems to have surrendered the post on 12 July 1604. According to Wotton, Hicks \\"was well skilled in philological learning, and had read over the polite Roman historians and moralists; out of which authors he made large collections, especially of the moral and wise sentences out of which he filled divers paper-books, still remaining in the family\\". Historian A. L. Rowse describes Hicks as a supporter of the Puritans and suggests he was the author (who to this day has not been conclusively identified) of the Marprelate Tracts. Rowse's view is based on the observation that the tracts were \\"clearly written by someone in a position to know everybody who was anybody\\" and the opinion that Hicks had a \\"merry, facetious pen\\". However, Rowse himself admits that the secret of the author's identity \\"seems lost for ever\\". Personal life and death In 1597 Hicks married Elizabeth Colston of Forest House, widow of Henry Pervis or Parvish (said to be an Italian merchant) of Ruckholt. Their eldest son, William (1596‚Äì1680), was created a baronet in 1619. He also served as a member of parliament, and was later imprisoned during the Civil War for his Royalist loyalties. The Earls St Aldwyn were his descendants. Hicks died at Ruckholt on 15 August 1612 of a \\"burning ague\\". He was buried at St Mary's Church, Leyton, where his sculptural monument survives, depicting him and his wife as semi- reclining figures.

A round trip train ticket cost one dollar in 1940 with lift tickets for fifty cents. The lodge could hold one thousand people and concessions were operated by the Ben Paris complex of Seattle. A Class-A ski jump was built in 1941 and was said to be the largest in North America. National championship events in ski jumping were held here, including the 1948 Olympic team tryouts, held the preceding spring. In 1949, the lodge burned down in the early hours of Friday, December 2; the ski area reopened a month later, and operated out of numerous railroad cars on a new spur line for the rest of the season, its last. The ski area reopened under new ownership in 1959 as Hyak, and continues as Summit East. It has the lowest base elevation of the four Summit at Snoqualmie ski areas, at approximately above sea level.

It is a residential studio, much like Ch√¢teau d'H√©rouville, with a chef-in- residence, three dwellings, and a swimming pool. The recording studio itself measures with a ceiling. The control room measures . History The studio was created in 1977 by jazz pianist Jacques Loussier and sound engineer Patrice Quef. Loussier began by recording his own work, mainly for films, and then started taking on French clients such as Maxime Le Forestier and Pierre Vassiliu. Miraval achieved fame thanks to Pink Floyd, who came there in 1979 to record part of their album The Wall, the liner notes of which credit Miraval. Subsequently, equipped with one of the first SSL mixing consoles in France, Miraval recorded AC/DC, The Cure, Muse, Wham!, David Sylvian (solo and with Rain Tree Crow), Chris Rea, Sade, the Go-Betweens, Steve Winwood, Yes, UB40, Chris Braide, Shirley Bassey, the Gipsy Kings, Shakatak, Rammstein, Fonky Family, Kelly Family, Blankass, Silmarils, Jimmy Barnes and many others. In 1992, Loussier sold Miraval to an American buyer. The studio remained active, in particular for the recording of Jacques' trio's albums. Since 2003, when Courtney Love spent several weeks there, the studio has throttled back, and it has suffered from the declining record sales plaguing the music industry in the 2000s. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been renting Miraval since the summer of 2008, which probably hinders commercial exploitation of the recording studio.

Ogle, 1812) (accessed July 26, 2009) Analysis Edwards wrote the Treatise to explain how true religious conversion to Christianity occurs. Edwards describes how emotion and intellect both play a role, but \\"converting grace\\" is what causes Christians to \\"awaken\\" to see that forgiveness is available to all who have faith that Jesus' sacrifice atones for all sins. This salvation is not possible through believers' imperfect good works which are simply evidence of faith, only through Christ's sacrifice which is free to all. Edwards describes the importance of testing new faith and discerning whether it is legitimate. He lays out twelve tests of true conversion, including ways of measuring allegedly fruitful works. He basically concludes that the fruit of the Spirit are the religious affections, love being the chief affection, and that all other fruit (or Christian virtues) flow from this. \\"Love is the chief of the affections, and as it were the fountain of them.\\" (p. 76, Banner of Truth Edition). He further says \\"for it was not by men's having the gifts of the Spirit (referring to spiritual gifts), but by their having the virtues of the Spirit, that they were called spiritual.\\" (p. 127). This is how you can distinguish between carnal men and spiritual men. Carnal men do not produce the fruit of the Spirit, but spiritual men do. So it was with Christ. \\"All the virtues of the Lamb of God, His humility, patience, meekness, submission, obedience, love and compassion, are exhibited to our view in a manner the most tending to move our affections of any that can be imagined.\\" (p. 53). Impact \\"Religious Affections\\" remains popular and modern day evangelists and writers such as Tim Keller and John Piper often refer to this and other Edwards works as models for their ministry.Timothy Keller, The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism (Dutton Adult, February 2008) See also * \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\\" * A Faithful Narrative * The Freedom of the Will ReferencesExternal links * Yale University Information on Religious Affections * PDF *Scan of a 1772 edition of Religious Affections held at the John Carter Brown Library 1746 books 18th- century Christian texts History books about the United States ","title":"Religious Affections"},{"id":"23741851","text":"The molecular formula C3H9O3P (molar mass: 124.076 g/mol) may refer to: * Dimethyl_methylphosphonate * Trimethyl_phosphite Molecular formulas ","title":"C3H9O3P"},{"id":"23741858","text":"du Toit is an Afrikaans surname, originally from Francois du Toit, a Huguenot who moved to South Africa in 1686.

Throughout his five years on General Synod, Miln worked with the Reverend Richard Kirker, an openly gay clergyman who had been refused priesthood by Dr Robert Runcie and who had, with others, set up the Gay Christian Movement, later the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement, and became its general secretary. In 1986 Miln met Derek Pattinson, then secretary-general of the General Synod of the Church of England and chairman of the executive committee of SPCK, formerly the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. They lived together for some years in a Church-owned flat in Westminster.The Independent newspaper, London, Friday 4 December 1992 The then Bishop of London, David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes, said he assumed \\"their domestic arrangements were satisfactory and wholesome\\". Pattinson travelled as part of his work, and took Miln with him on a trip to South Africa in 1990; questions surrounding the propriety of this caused press attention.

O'Reilly introduced Miln to drugs, and soon Miln was a heavy user. O'Reilly died after an altercation with a drug dealer in London's Kings Cross while buying cocaine as a forty- fifth birthday present for Miln. Miln believed it was murder, but the Crown Prosecution Service declined to bring a case.  Coming out as gay  The General Synod of the Church of England in November 1987 also debated homosexuality in a separate debate.

In 2003 a Sunday People article reported that Miln was running a rent boy S&M; club in the flat he had shared with Pattinson. The investigation revealed that Miln had rent boys on his books charging ¬£200 each. Miln told the undercover reporter that senior church figures, Westminster MP's, civil servants, and members of the royal household were amongst the clientele for his services and the monthly orgies he held. According to the People, Miln tried to recruit the reporter as a rent boy and gave him an ecstasy tablet to help him relax. Laboratory tests later confirmed it was the drug. Miln also reportedly offered the journalist unprotected sex, telling him: \\"There is nothing better than dangerous sex. I could have HIV but at my age I don't care.

That branch was created as an institute of part-time form of training. In the beginning there were only four specialties of training. But requirements of the population in domestic service weren‚Äôt satisfied enough, and the mission of the institute was to prepare the sufficient supply of highly qualified professionals not only for Leningrad enterprises, but for whole the North-West region. Today St. Petersburg State University of Service and Economics is modern, high-speed developing and the youngest State university of St. Petersburg. The number of specialties increased till 53 in 2008. Since 1990 institute starts to prepare the specialists by full-time training. Many new specialties had been opened.

Early life and education Abdou was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where she spent her early childhood. Justin Abdou is her only sibling. She received a B.A. (Honours) from the University of Regina (Saskatchewan) in 1991, an M.A. (English) from the University of Western Ontario in 1992, and a PhD (English in the Field of Creative Writing and Canadian Literature) from The University of Calgary in 2009. She currently lives in Fernie, British Columbia, Canada and is an Associate Professor of Creative Writing at Athabasca University (Canada's only open university). She lives with her husband, Martin Hafke, and her children, Oliver and Katherine. Career Abdou's first collection of fiction, Anything Boys Can Do, was published in 2006 by Thistledown Press. B.C. BookWorld praised the collection as \\"an extraordinary literary debut.\\" The book deals with contemporary heterosexual relationships and addresses topics such as infidelity and miscommunication between the sexes. In The Victoria Times Colonist, Brownen Welch claims that \\"Abdou confirms for us that the female frame is capable of holding within itself a multiplicity of complications and contradictions.\\" Welch praises Abdou for finding a nonjudgemental language with which to discuss female sexuality. Abdou's first novel, The Bone Cage, was published in 2007 by NeWest Press. The novel follows the lives of two Olympic athletes near the end of their careers and explores the connection between body and identity. It describes elite athletics with much detail. A review in VUE Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta) states: \\"Angie Abdou's debut novel, The Bone Cage, finds its to question what happens to athletes who put everything else on hold for a chance at the lurks in the shadows of elite athletics is what makes Abdou's follow up to Anything Boys Can Do, a book of short stories, so compelling\\". The Bone Cages themes, though, are also relevant outside the world of athletics. In Canadian Literature a reviewer writes: \\"The Bone Cage extends past sport, exploring the tentative relationship between people and their bodies. Are we simply prisoners of our own \\"bone cage,\\" predestined by our body, or can we overcome the limits of our body? Do we even want to overcome our body, or is it simply inseparable from ourselves? The Bone Cage's questioning of an inherent self-body dichotomy reaches out universally, involving not only sport, but also illness and death. Ultimately, because Abdou does not offer concrete answers for these questions, she shows that though the specific relationship between body and self is individualized, our struggle to reconcile them is universal.\\" The Bone Cage was a finalist for CBC's 2011 Canada Reads and was defended by ex-NHL player Georges Laraque. Shortly after the 2011 Canada Reads debates, The Bone Cage was selected as The MacEwan Book of the Year for the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year. Past recipients of this honour include Margaret Atwood, Yann Martel, Annabel Lyon, Thomas Wharton, and David Adams Richards. The Bone Cage was also selected by Kootenay Library Foundation as the feature book for its first annual \\"One Book, One Kootenay\\" celebration (launched 8 September 2009). Abdou's second novel, The Canterbury Trail, originated as a dissertation project at The University of Calgary. It was released in February 2011 by Brindle and Glass Press (Victoria, BC). It was a finalist for the 2011 Banff Mountain Book Festival Book of the Year Award in the Literature category. The Canterbury Trail also won a 2012 IPPY (Independent Publishing Award, Gold Medal for Canada West). Aboou's third novel is Between. Published by Arsenal Pulp Press in August 2014, it explores the lives of two women: Ligaya (a nanny from the Philippines) and Vero (an overextended working mother in North America). The Library Journal selected as a Top Indie pick for Spring 2015. It was named a best of 2014 book by Vancouver Sun, PRISM Magazine, and 49th Shelf. Abdou's fifth book of fiction (In Case I Go, Arsenal Pulp Press) was published in the fall of 2017. Andrew Pyper, author of The Only Child and The Demononlogist, says: \\"The past reaches up from the soil of In Case I Go to grab hold of its characters and readers alike, refusing to let go. Angie Abdou has written a grown-up work of fantasy, transporting as it is grounded and real.\\" It was a finalist for the Banff Mountain Book award in the fiction and poetry category. Chatelaine magazine named it one of 2017's most riveting mysteries. Home Ice: Reflections of a Reluctant Hockey Mom is Angie's first nonfiction book. It hit the Canadian bestseller list the week of its release. In a starred review, Booklist claims: \\"The author brings a novelist's eye to the story, telling it in first-person present tense; with its sharp characterizations and dialogue in place of autobiographical exposition, the book is a first-rate memoir and a fine example of narrative nonfiction. It's also a must-read for parents with youngsters who play organized sports.\\" In The Nordic Sports Forum, Swedish scholar Tobias Stark calls Home Ice \\"one of the most memorable hockey books ever written.\\" Abdou is an enthusiastic instructor of creative writing who teaches courses and workshops at College of the Rockies, Sage Hill Teen Writing Experience, Write in the Kootenays and The Fernie Writers' Conference.

The Kiel‚ÄìL√ºbeck railway runs along its banks. The north side of the castle which faces the town Pl√∂n Castle () in Pl√∂n is one of the largest castles in the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein and the only one located on a hill.Schloss Pl√∂n at www.fielmann-akademie.com. Accessed on 31 Aug 2010. The former Residenz of the Dukes of Schleswig- Holstein-Pl√∂n was built in the 17th century during the Thirty Years War and has had a colourful history in which it has, for example, been a school for military cadets and also a boarding school. The castle ended the twentieth century as a possession of the state of Schleswig-Holstein, but they could not fund its renovation and so it had to be sold again. Since January 2002 it has belonged to the Fielmann Akademie Schloss Pl√∂n and, after extensive conversion, serves as a training and qualification centre for a branch of optometry. After being inaccessible to the general public for many years when it was a boarding school, its new owners have opened it to a limited extent to visitors.  History = Prehistory of the castle site = The earliest Wendish defensive fortification called Plune dates to the 10th century and was located on the island of Olsborg in Lake Pl√∂n. It was destroyed in 1158. The rebuilding of the castle was carried out under Count Adolphus II of Holstein, and it served as a base during the colonization of the once-Slavic region. In 1173 the castle was moved to the Bischofsberg hill next to the small town of Pl√∂n - to the site of the present Pl√∂n Castle. In the 12th century Pl√∂n developed slowly into a market town and was given town rights in 1239. From 1290 to 1390 the hill castle was the seat of the Schauenburg line of Holstein- Pl√∂n and, after their extinction, was transferred to the Duke of Schleswig, Gerhard VI. Through the dukes of Schleswig, the small fortress was passed, four generations later, to the Danish royal family (Christian I was Duke of Schleswig and King of Denmark in personal union). During this period, however, Pl√∂n and its castle played no significant role in the country's history.Daten und Ereignisse dieses Absatzes aus J. Habich, D. Lafrenz, H. Schulze, L.

Following that a new, larger, building was built on the still partly Romanesque castle grounds. In 1564 King Frederick II of Denmark transferred to his brother, John the Younger, one third of his share of Schleswig and Holstein, in violation of the Treaty of Ribe, whereupon John founded the \\"titular duchy\\" (abgeteiltes Herzogtum) of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg. Amongst his estates was Pl√∂n, including the castle. Under Duke John, an early mercantilist, town and castle experienced an economic boom.Daten und Ereignisse dieses Absatzes aus J. Habich, D.

Accessed on 31 Aug 2010. = Residence of the Dukes of Pl√∂n = The first duke of this line was Joachim Ernest of Schleswig-Holstein- Pl√∂n, the second youngest son of Duke John. On the occasion of his marriage to the Gottorf princess, Dorothea Augusta, the new ruler decided to build a palace fit for himself and his family. The project was financed inter alia by the respectable dowry of the bride.I. Bubert, H. P. Walter: Gutsh√∂fe, Herrenh√§user und Schl√∂sser in Schleswig-Holstein. p. 241. In 1632 the old castle was demolished at the behest of the Duke of Pl√∂n and in its place the current castle was built in the Renaissance style. The new residence was completed in just three years in the middle of the Thirty Years War.Dehio: Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler. Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein. p. 688. The castle was the residence (Residenz) of the ducal family, but was never as important a place in state politics as Gottorf Castle. Because the dukes of Pl√∂n had other castles and summer residences, such as Traventhal House and the castles in Ahrensb√∂k, Rethwisch and Reinfeld the Pl√∂n residence was not continuously occupied. Nevertheless, the building was one of the cultural centres of the duchy. Joachim Ernest established a library in the castle, which was expanded by his successors to 10,000 volumes.Die Tradition der Optik at www.fielmann-akademie.com. Accessed on 31 Aug 2010. In addition, the Duke was very interested in physics and optics and collected various optical devices and instruments in his residence at Pl√∂n. After Duke Joachim Ernest, the castle went to his son, Hans Adolf, who, however, as a general in the service of the Emperor, rarely stayed in Pl√∂n and the duchy was largely represented by his wife and mother. Joachim Frederick, who followed Hans Adolf, also resided here. After he died in debt in 1722 without male heirs, the castle stood empty for seven years and some of the furniture was passed to his creditors. The castle experienced its cultural heyday from 1729 onwards under the last duke, Frederick Charles. He introduced a baroque court and had the interior of the castle decorated in the rococo style. Frederick Charles extended the castle, erecting buildings around the castle courtyard that have survived to this day - the royal stables, the riding hall - as well as the garden palace, now known as the Princes' House.Dehio: Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler. Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein. p. 688f. The castle was the residence of the Dukes of Pl√∂n until the death of Frederick Charles, who died without male heirs in 1761. Upon his death the enfeoffment expired and the duchy returned to the Danish royal house. The building was occupied as a widow's residence by his wife, Christiane Armgardis, until her death in 1779. It subsequently served as the seat of the bailiff (Amtmann), and also from 1777 to 1823 as a residence for Peter Frederick William, the mentally deranged son of Frederick Augustus I of Oldenburg. The young man, who was unable to discharge his duties as a duke, was given the castle by his guardian, assigned to the Danish king Christian VII and was allowed to retain a large household.I. Bubert, H. P. Walter: Gutsh√∂fe, Herrenh√§user und Schl√∂sser in Schleswig-Holstein. p. 245. After his death, the castle was used temporarily as a courtly residence. In 1833 a grammar school was established in the castle. The town and castle of Pl√∂n on an 1864 engraving = Danish royal summer residence = In 1840 the castle became the official summer residence of the King of Denmark, Christian VIII. He had Pl√∂n Castle renovated and the furnishing partly replaced in a Classicist style. At that time it was decorated in white plaster, reminiscent of Danish castles such as Gr√•sten and Fredensborg.Schloss Pl√∂n. at www.fielmann-akademie.com. Accessed on 31 Aug 2010. N.B. The reign of Christian VIII is incorrectly stated as ending in 1863. = Cadet training and educational establishment = After the Second Schleswig War of 1864, the castle fell into Prussian hands. In 1868, the interior furnishings were removed and most of them taken to Kiel Castle, where they were destroyed by fire in 1942 following an air raid. Pl√∂n Castle was rebuilt inside as barracks and subsequently served the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein as a military school for cadets. The sons of the German Emperor, William II, were educated in Pl√∂n from the end of the 19th century and, for that purpose, the summer residence in the garden was extended to form the so-called Princes' House. An educational farm was set up on Princes' Island and Princes' Station was built in front of the castle on the newly laid railway line. At the suggestion of the Empress, Augusta Victoria, the chapel was given a new mural. After World War I, military schools were banned by the Treaty of Versailles and the castle was used in the 1920s as a state educational institution (Staatliche Bildungsanstalt). In 1933 Pl√∂n Castle and the area around it was used as a National Political Institute, an elite school under the Nazi regime. Until the assassination of Ernst R√∂hm in 1934 it bore his name.Zeitleiste Gymnasium Schloss Pl√∂n, 1933‚Äì1945 In 1945, Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz stayed for a few days in Pl√∂n, where he established a temporary command post. Before fleeing to Flensburg, the castle was the administrative headquarters for parts of the Flensburg Government for a single day on 2 May 1945.Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz - Last President of a United Germany at greyfalcon.us. Accessed on 31 Aug 2010. The castle survived both world wars without suffering any wartime damage. Afterwards British occupation troops entered Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg as part of VIII Corps under General Evelyn Barker, and established their headquarters in the castle. = Boarding school = In 1946, with the permission of the British military government, the Pl√∂n Castle State Boarding School (Staatliche Internat Schloss Pl√∂n) for boys and girls was established in the castle. The boarding school utilised the entire castle grounds. The castle itself was used to accommodate the boys and the Princes' House the girls. The boat house and other outbuildings were purchased by the school. Lessons took place in the nearby Pl√∂n Castle Grammar School (Internatsgymnasium Schloss Pl√∂n now the Gymnasium Schloss Pl√∂n) in Prinzenstra√üe. Its use as accommodation left its mark on the old castle, which became increasingly dilapidated. Advice in 1986/1988 showed that the site needed major investment and would only be saved from ruin by spending tens of millions of deutschmarks. By 1992 the castle was put on the market and in 1995 the outbuildings were sold. The sale was necessary because the state was unable to sustain the uneconomic running of the boarding school and the restoration of a historical monument.Geschichte des Schlosses auf geschichte- s-h.de . In 2001 the boarding school was finally closed. The former pupils, teachers and staff still belong to an association, the Verein der Butenpl√∂ner.Verein Butenpl√∂ner e. V.. = Film-set = Whilst it was still a boarding school, the castle served as a film-set in several German shows: * in 1969 for the thriller Seven Days Grace, * from 1997 on for the television series Die Schule am See (\\"The School on the Lake\\"), which was repeatedly shown on ARD television, * in 1994 in the movie Charlie & Louise an adaption of Erich K√§stners junior novel Das doppelte Lottchen (Lottie and Lisa; republished as The Parent Trap). = Sale and reconstruction = After several unsustainable bids to the future of the castle, G√ºnther Fielmann submitted an offer in 2002. Because this offer included an elaborate argument of the various benefits to the public, Schleswig-Holstein's state parliament approved it in 2002Niederschrift des Landtages Schleswig-Holstein vom 13. Dezember 2000 . Consequently, the Fielmann Akademie foundation purchased the castle for 3.6 million Euro. G√ºnther Fielmann summarised the state of the monument at that time: :: When we took over the castle in 2002 it was in a deplorable condition. The broad baroque era hallways had been converted to rooms for school children, using light-weight walls. Barely anything of the original floor plan was visible and the structure had been badly damaged everywhere you looked.German article published at the opening of the castle and academy. Over four years the castle has been reconstructed in accordance with preservation and heritage orders. The total costs amounted to more than 35 million EurosArticle retrieved from www.ndr.de about the re-opening of the castle on October 7, 2006. Schleswig-Holstein supported the project with 11.8 million Euros. The reconstruction was completed in 2006. = Academy = Today the castle is a public site of historical heritage hosting an elite optician academy. The first master classes already commenced in 2002 during the reconstruction period. Since the winter semester 2005/06 the academy offers a Bachelor's degree in optometry (BSc Augenoptik / Optometrie) in cooperation with the Fachhochschule L√ºbeck. It also provides various courses for both skilled workers and executives of the optical industry. Per year more than 6,000 opticians are qualified. 24 lecturers teach at the academy.Article retrieved from www.Welt.de about the re-opening of the castle on September 25, 2006. The castle is used - to a large extent - by the academy. Some parts however serve as a museum: the Duke's historical Rokoko-rooms in the East wing of the castle have been intricately restored and can be viewed during daily tours.Contact data for visitors.

Notable rulings  * On September 11, 2013, in American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jackson declined to enjoin a U.S. Department of Agriculture rule preliminarily that required meatpackers to identify the animal's country of origin. She found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment. * On September 5, 2014, in Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services, Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug, Gralise, despite the fact that Gralise met the statutory requirements for exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. * On September 11, 2015, in Pierce v. District of Columbia, Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to assess the inmate‚Äôs need for accommodations when he first arrived at the jail. * In April and June of 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early. Jackson ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early, without any explanation for doing so, was arbitrary and capricious. * On August 15, 2018, in AFGE, AFL-CIO v. Trump, Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. * On November 23, 2018, Jackson held that 40 lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation, should be brought in Malaysia, not the United States. * On September 4, 2019, in Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan, Jackson held that Congress had stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non- constitutional challenges to the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border. * On September 29, 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in Make The Road New York v. McAleenan, blocking an agency rule that would have expanded \\"fast- track\\" deportations without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants. Jackson found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule, which made Jackson set aside the rule. * On November 25, 2019, Jackson issued an important ruling in Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued Don McGahn, former White House Counsel for the Trump administration, to compel him to comply with the its subpoena to appear at a hearing on its impeachment inquiry on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after U.S. President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \\"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\\" even if the President orders them not to do so.Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v.

More specifically, a mooring mast is a mast or tower that contains a fitting on its top that allows for the bow of the airship to attach its mooring line to the structure. When it is not necessary or convenient to put an airship into its hangar (or shed) between flights, airships can be moored on the surface of land or water, in the air to one or more wires, or to a mooring mast. After their development mooring masts became the standard approach to mooring airships as considerable manhandling was avoided.Williams, T, 2009 (Reissue), \\"Airship Pilot No. 28\\", Darcy Press, UK,  Mast types  Airship mooring masts can be broadly divided into fixed high masts and fixed or mobile low (or ‚Äòstub‚Äô) masts. In the 1920s and 1930s masts were built in many countries. At least two were mounted on ships. Without doubt the tallest mooring mast ever designed was the spire of the Empire State Building which was originally constructed to serve as a mooring mast, although soon after converted for use as a television and radio transmitter tower due to the discovered infeasibility of mooring an airship, for any length of time, to a very tall mast in the middle of an urban area. Another unique example may be found in Birmingham, Alabama, atop the former Thomas Jefferson Hotel. Now known as Thomas Jefferson Tower, the mast has been recently restored to its original appearance. It was originally erected as a way for the hotel to capitalize on the futuristic public image of airships; the tower was never intended to be used and would likely not withstand the stresses involved.thumbrightHMA No 1 (Mayfly) ‚Äì the first airship known to have been moored to a mast. Early developments Mooring an airship by the nose to the top of a mast or tower of some kind might appear to be an obvious solution, but dirigibles had been flying for some years before the mooring mast made its appearance. The first airship known to have been moored to a mast was HMA (His Majesty's Airship) No.1, named the ‚ÄòMayfly‚Äô, on 22 May 1911. The mast was mounted on a pontoon, and a windbreak of cross-yards with strips of canvas were attached to it. However, the windbreak caused the ship to yaw badly, and she became more stable when it was removed, withstanding winds gusting up to .Ventry, A. and Kolesnik, E, 1982, ‚ÄòAirship Saga‚Äô, Blandford Press, Dorset, Further experiments in mooring blimps to cable-stayed lattice masts were carried out during 1918.Jackson, R., 1971,\\"Airships in Peace and War\\", Cassel and Company Ltd, London WC1,  Impact of mooring mast technology  Mooring mast technology became widely utilised in the 20th century as it allowed an unprecedented accessibility to dirigibles, negating the manhandling that was necessary when an airship was placed into its hangar. Mooring masts were designed simply to allow airships to be docked on ships, land and even atop buildings, all while withstanding gusts and adverse weather conditions. Such versatility meant that mooring masts became the standard approach to docking dirigibles, as blimps could now operate from mobile masts for long periods of time without returning to their hangers. Developments to these mooring technologies allowed for further advancement of airspace technology in the 20th century. British high mast operations The British mooring mast was developed more or less to its final form at Pulham and Cardington in 1919‚Äì21 to make the landing process easier and more economical of manpower The R101 being handled on the ground, showing the size of the landing party required to manage a large airship. One purpose of a mooring mast was to reduce the number of men needed to manage the landing process. The following account of the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Masefield, Sir P, 1982, \\"To Ride the Storm: the story of the airship R101\\", William Kimber & Co., London, > Mooring masts were developed to act as a safe open harbour to which airships > could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive > (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload. The Cardington mast, > completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, high, tapering > from diameter at ground level to at the passenger platform, from the ground. > Above the passenger platform was the of the conical housing for the mooring > gear. A lower platform above the ground accommodated searchlights and > signalling gear in a gallery wide. The top platform, at the height of , from > which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was in > diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet > formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels > to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with > the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, > encircled by a stairway to provide foot access. The upper portion of the > tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret > surmounted by a truncated cone with its top above the passenger platform.

The R100 at the mooring mast in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 1930Four high masts of the Cardington type were built along the proposed British Empire Airship Service routes, at Cardington itself, at Montreal (Canada), Ismailia (Egypt) and Karachi (then India, now in Pakistan). None of these survive. Similar masts were proposed at sites in Australia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Bombay, Keeling Islands, Kenya, Malta, at Ohakea in New Zealand, and in South Africa.http://www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/sheds/index.html The general site specifications can be found in documents produced by the British government.http://www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/imperial/Airship%20Station.htm German mast techniques German mooring methods differed significantly from those adopted by the British. To quote Pugsley (1981):Pugsley, Sir Alfred, OBE FRS\\", The Engineering Development of Rigid Airships\\", Transactions of the Newcomen Society, 1981‚Äì82 Vol 53 > \\"the Germans, originally for ease of transport and for economy, developed a > system using much lower masts. The nose of the ship was tethered as before > to the mast head, which was only a little higher than the semi-diameter of > the ship's hull. The lower fin at the stern was then fixed to a heavy > carriage running on a circular railway track around the mast, and this > carriage was powered so as to be able to move around the track to keep the > ship head on to the wind. In the most sophisticated form, used by the > Hindenburg, the rail system was linked to rails running from the mast > straight into the airship shed, and the mast was powered so that the ship > could be moved mechanically into the shed, complete with mast and stern > carriage\\". The following account of landing the German airship Graf Zeppelin is abridged from Dick and Robinson (1985):Dick, H. and Robinson, D, 1985, \\"The Golden Age of the great passenger airships, Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg\\", Smithsonian Institution, > Before attempting a landing, contact was made by radio or flag signals with > the ground crew to determine the ground temperature and wind conditions. For > a normal calm weather landing the ship was trimmed very slightly nose down, > as this gave a better gliding angle and the ship almost flew herself down. A > smoky fire was started on the ground to show the wind direction. The ship > then made a long approach with a rate of fall of 100 feet per minute, and > the lines were dropped when she was over the landing flag. When conditions > were unusual, as in gusty and bumpy weather, the Graf was weighed off a > little light, and the approach had to be fast and preferably long and low. > When the airship was over the field the engines had to be reversed for some > time to stop her, and this also helped to get the nose down. Yaw lines > dropped from the ship's nose were drawn out to Port and Starboard by thirty > men each, while twenty more on each side pulled the ship down with spider > lines (so called because twenty short lines radiated like the legs of a > spider from a block). When the airship reached the ground, fifty men held > the control car rails and twenty held those of the after car. With thirty > men in reserve, the ground crew totalled two hundred men. The ground crew > would then walk the Graf to a short, or ‚Äòstub‚Äô, mast, to which the nose of > the airship would be attached. The airship would then rest on the ground > with its rear gondola attached to a movable weighted carriage that enabled > the airship to swing around the mast with the wind. In some places the stub > mast was mounted on rails and could be drawn into the airship hangar, > guiding the nose of the ship while the tail was controlled by the carriage > attached to the rear gondola. Airships designed for landing on the ground > had pneumatic bumper bags or undercarriage wheels under the main and rear > gondolas (or tail fin). Dick states that the Germans never used mooring masts until the Graf Zeppelin entered service in 1928, and never moored to high masts. To some extent this probably reflects the conservatism of the Zeppelin company operations. Long experience in handling airships in all sorts of conditions was valued and innovations or significant changes in practice were unlikely to be adopted unless clear advantages were apparent. United States In the US a mix of techniques were applied, and airships moored to both high and stub masts. Large ground crews (or ‚Äòlanding parties‚Äô) of up to 340 men were required to manage the large airships and at landing or on the ground, before they could be attached to the stub mast. Being part of a ground crew was not risk-free. In gusty conditions, or if mis-handled, an airship could suddenly rise. If the ground crew did not immediately let go of the handling lines they risked being carried off their feet. In one famous incident captured on movie film in 1932, during the landing of the US airship Akron, three men were carried off their feet in this way, two to fall to their deaths after a short time. The third managed to improve his hold on the handling rope until he could be hauled into the airship.http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/ac-usn22/z-types/zrs4-k.htm Ship-mounted mooring masts USS Shenandoah moored to the USS Patoka (AO-9).

Modern mast operations Smaller mobile masts have been used for small airships and blimps for a long time. They may be wheel or track-mounted, and can be operated by a small crew. The general operating principle is broadly similar to the larger masts. Modern blimps may operate from mobile masts for months at a time without returning to their hangars.

The current building was erected in 1716 and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. History The 'hospital of the baths' was built beside the hot springs of the Cross Bath, for their health giving properties and to provide shelter for the poor infirm. It was placed under the control of Bath Cathedral Priory which became Bath Abbey. One of the key benefactors was Canon William of Wheathampstead, who gave substantial areas of land to support the hospital. Funds were needed for the upkeep of the hospital and, in 1400, the Pope encouraged visitors on certain days to make donations in exchange for being granted remission of their sins. It was suggested in 1527 that the hospital be amalgamated with the Priory to provide greater access to its wealth, however this did not happen. In 1535 it was valued at ¬£22 16s. 9d. During the Dissolution of the monasteries it managed to remain independent and attempts by William Crouch to take it into private property were defeated after the city fathers petitioned Queen Elizabeth I. During the rest of the Elizabethan era when wealthy visitors came to the spa the almshouse provided lodgings. In 1716 the architect William Killigrew was commissioned to rebuild the hospital. Construction continued after 1727 with John Wood, the Elder undertaking the building, as his first work in Bath, when he was aged 23. He went on to design many of the buildings which created the Georgian city. Horace Walpole stayed here in 1765. The site now includes Chapel Court, and still operates to provide a home for over 100 of the local elderly poor and make grants to individuals and organisations in and around Bath. The charity is now known as The Hospital of St John the Baptist with the Chapel of St Michael annexed with St Catherine's Hospital. Architecture The architecture is palladian, which is common in Bath. The two-storey Bath stone building has a heavy ground floor arcade of round-headed arches on pillars, and retains its original window mouldings and sashes.

Synopsis Set in cell-block J of the Bass Women's prison in Wisconsin, the show focuses on the interactions among the prison inmates. The show's cast include Peggy Cass, Julia Campbell, Antoinette Byron, Blake Clark, Denny Dillon, C. C. H. Pounder, and Wendie Jo Sperber. Campbell stars as Vicki Springer, an overachieving yuppie, who was brought to Bass Women's Prison for supposedly shoplifting (she had been actually framed on the charge by her scheming no- good husband), where she had to deal with the inmates. Eve Shipley (Cass) was the old lady prisoner, having been there for almost 10 years and was kind of the old hand prisoner, helping others get used to the routine; Dawn Murphy (Pounder) was a bad tempered African-American woman who had murdered her abusive husband; and Bonnie Harper (Byron) was in for prostitution. Vickie, Eve, Dawn and Bonnie all shared a cell, while, in a nearby cell of her own, complete with computer access, was Pam (Sperber), who was, not surprisingly, in prison for computer fraud. They all had to contend with guard Meg Bando (Dillon), who didn't like the prisoners, and vice versa, and the assistant warden, Clint Rafferty (Clark), for whom Vicki worked as a secretary (for her prison job) and to whom he was attracted. Only thirteen episodes of the series were produced and aired. Cast *Julia Campbell as Vicki Springer *Blake Clark as Clint Rafferty *C. C. H.

Biography=Early life= Philipp Julius was the son of Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Pomerania, and Sophia Hedwig, daughter of Julius of Brunswick-L√ºneburg.Th√ºmmel (2002), p.87 Ernst Ludwig died on 17 July 1592. From 1592 to 1603, Philipp Julius was under the tutelage of his uncle, Bogislaw XIII.Schleinert (2000), p.68 During this time, he received his education at the University of Leipzig,Stannek (2001), p.88 and afterwards travelled to nearly all courts from England to Italy.Wade (2003), p.66 On 25 June 1604,Hildisch (1980), p.97 he married Agnes of Brandenburg (1584-1629), daughter of John George, Elector of Brandenburg and his second wife, Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst.Heinrich (1981), p.549 A month after his marriage, Philipp Julius reached his majority and took on his position as a duke on 21 July 1604. He continued his extensive travelling, visiting England, the Dutch Republic, Denmark, Berlin, Danzig, Courland, and other locations en route. His travelling caused him to be absent for years. =Financial crisis= Philipp Julius suffered serious financial difficulties throughout his reign.Branig (1997), p.173Evans (1979), p.42Kr√ºger (2006), p.135 While not curtailing his own expenses, he limited the travels of the functionaries of his court. Also, most of the ducal domains were leased to third parties, causing a significant worsening of the peasants' situation. The rate of compulsory work the peasants were obliged to doubled during Philipp Julius' reign.Kaak (1981), p.159 Studies revealed that nearly all peasants on the island of R√ºgen were impoverished or indebted by the time of his death.Kaak (1981), p.159, citing C.J.Fuchs, Der Untergang. The duke also attempted to get the Hanseatic towns of Greifswald and Stralsund to assume parts of his debts, triggering heavy conflicts. In 1604, an intervention in Greifswald's inner affairs went in his favour.Branig (1997), p.167 In 1612, he humiliated the towns when, in disregard of their traditional autonomy, he entered their limits in company of several hundred mercenaries.Asche (2008), p.74 In 1613, Philipp Julius granted town law to Bergen for a payment of 8,000 Mark.Jendricke (2008), p.81 Philipp Julius attempted to control inflation, with limited success, by seeking closer contacts to the Lower Saxon Circle, causing some conflicts with his home, Upper Saxon Circle as well as the other Pomeranian Teilherzogtum, Pomerania-Stettin. Matthias (II), Holy Roman Emperor, called in by the Upper Saxon Circle, even intervened in Philipp Julius' coining policies in the mint of Franzburg in 1616, however confused him with his cousin Philip II of Pomerania-Stettin and thus corresponded with the latter.Kr√ºger (2006), pp.107ff In 1622, Philipp Julius followed an invitation of Christian IV of Denmark and participated in an assembly (Kreistag) of the Lower Saxon Circle to explore a common financial strategy.Kr√ºger (2006), pp.133-134 The resulting treaty of Hamburg, ratified on 14 March, was to come into effect on 6 July. The Upper Saxon Circle however forced Philipp Julius to return to the previous state on 6 November. Between 1623Porada (1997), p.22 and 1625, the duke also negotiated with the Danish king the sale of R√ºgen to the latter in return for 150,000 Reichstalers, which only failed due to Bogislaw XIV's veto. =Conflicts within the Upper Saxon Circle= The later years of Philipp Julius' reign were dominated by his struggle to maintain political independence within the Upper Saxon Circle in face of hegemonial tendencies of the Electorate of Saxony and a political crisis resulting from the evolving Thirty Years' War. In 1620, the circle's representatives were assembled in a Kreistag in Leipzig, organized by John George I, Elector of Saxony.Nicklas (2002), p.201 The assembly was dominated by the Saxon electorate who had managed to prevent Brandenburg and Saxe-Weimar from participation, furthermore the delegation of Anhalt departed in the course of the negotiations.Nicklas (2002), p.206 It called for a high monetary contribution of the circle's members for the mercenary army already raised by Saxony.Nicklas (2002), p.203 It also claimed neutrality for the circle in the Thirty Years' War that at this time ravaged Bohemia, with the caveat of being able to switch to emperor Ferdinand II's side.Nicklas (2002), p.205 The Pomeranian delegation accepted the decisions only ad-referendum,Nicklas (2002), p.207 and refused to pay its resulting obligations. Continued dunning by the Saxon electorate in 1621, which had furthered her military position by successful campaigns in Silesia, led to a meeting of Pomeranian and Brandenburgian delegations at Prenzlau in 1622 to explore a possible alliance against John George. The alliance however did not take place because of Pomeranian caveats: The Pomeranian dukes did not want to get rid of the Saxon thread at the cost of subordination to Brandenburg.Nicklas (2002), p.213 Yet, they supported a Brandenburgian attempt to declare the Leipzig decisions void, which was rejected by the Saxon electorates and followed by even more dunning.Nicklas (2002), p.214 In 1623, threatened by Tilly's success in Hesse and Lower Saxony, the Brandenburgian and Saxon electorates formed an alliance, decided to raise armies, and divided the circle into two respective domains of command, with Pomerania becoming part of the Brandenburgian one.Nicklas (2002), p.217 Pomerania however refused to obey the Brandenburgian command and raised its own troops.Nicklas (2002), p.218 In July 1624, the Saxon-led South of the circle sided with the emperor. Philipp Julius and Bogislaw XIV of Pomerania-Stettin were also willing to come to an agreement with the emperor, and accepted imperial monetary demands that they previously had rejected. Yet, neither Philipp Julius nor Bogislaw XIV were able to push their ideas through the opposition of the nobility at the Kreistag in J√ºterbog in August. Thus, Pomerania did not follow the Saxon electorate's example - neither did Brandenburg.Nicklas (2002), p.220 =Death= Philipp Julius died only months before imperial forces occupied parts of the Upper Saxon circle,Nicklas (2002), p.222 on 6 February 1625. He was entombed in the ducal crypt in the church of Wolgast. Two years later, the war would reach Pomerania causing complete devastation and the death of two thirds of the population.Buchholz (1999), pp.263,332 With the death of Philipp Julius, Pomerania-Wolgast ceased to exist.Goetz (2006), p.112 Philipp Julius died without issue,Wolgast (1995), p.217 and Pomerania-Wolgast fell to Bogislaw XIV, who united all of the Duchy of Pomerania under his rule until he also died without issue in 1637, marking the extinction of the House of Pomerania.Dubilski (2003), p.25 The residence in Wolgast decayed after Philipp Julius' death, was badly damaged during the Thirty Years' War, and, after 1798, most of the stone was scavenged and reused in other buildings. Today, only parts of the basements remain. Cultural legacy Philippshagen, named after Philipp Julius. Train station. In 1619, Philipp Julius donated a precious gown to the rectorate of the University of Greifswald, which was worn by the rectors at special occasions until very recently.

Produced by ATV and STAR TV, the series starred Donnie Yen as Chen Zhen (Cantonese: Chan Zan), a character previously portrayed by Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury (1972) and Jet Li in Fist of Legend (1994). The series is also related to the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen, in which Yen reprises his role. Plot The series is set in early Republican China. Chan Zan travels to Shanghai with his younger sister in search of a new life after their hometown is destroyed by a group of bandits. Upon his arrival, he notices that Shanghai is divided into an international settlement under the control of various foreign powers such as Britain and Japan. He also observes that the martial artists' community in Shanghai is marred with disunity and the various schools are pursuing their individual goals. The fractured status of the martial arts community reflects the state of China: the Chinese are individualistic and are often engaging in internal conflict instead of uniting to drive out their common enemies (the overbearing foreigners) and regain sovereignty of their nation. Fok Yuen-gap, the founder of Ching-mou School, is trying hard to persuade and influence the other schools to unite under a common purpose of defending China from foreign intrusion. Chan becomes a rickshaw puller and coolie to earn a living in Shanghai. Once, he saves the famous singer Yi-kiu from some ruffians and is invited to join the notorious Green Gang through her introduction. Chan proves himself to be the best fighter in the gang and wins the favour of its boss, Choi Luk-kan. At the same time, he encounters the bandits who murdered his family, who are coincidentally allies of the Green Gang. Chan is unable to convince his fellow gang members to support him in taking revenge on the bandits. When his sister is killed by the bandits later, Chan learns a painful lesson that he should distance himself from the gang's illegal activities. He leaves the gang after killing his sister's murderers. He joins Ching-mou School after being enlightened by Fok Yuen-gap in the few earlier encounters they had. Chan becomes Fok's favourite student as he demonstrates an excellent understanding of Fok's martial arts philosophy. Fok grooms Chan to be his successor and Chan gradually matures under Fok's teachings to become a powerful martial artist who truly understands Ching-mou School's founding principles. Meanwhile, Chan Zan also falls in love with Yumi, the daughter of the Japanese consul Takeda Yukio. However, their relationship is strained because they stand on opposing grounds, as well as coming from strikingly different backgrounds. To complicate their relationship, Ching-mou School is a strong supporter of the anti-Japanese movement, and Fok Yuen-gap has foiled Takeda's plans to take over Shanghai on numerous occasions. At the same time, Yumi's fiance, Ishii Hideaki, arrives from Japan to start a dojo with his brother in Hongkou District. Ishii's presence causes Chan and Yumi's relationship to be further strained. Takeda founds the Black Dragon Society in Shanghai to spy on the Chinese military for the Japanese government in preparation for a future invasion of China. Takeda is aware that he must kill Fok Yuen-gap in order to crush the Chinese people's morale, because they look up to Fok as a national hero. Takeda sends a spy to infiltrate Ching-mou School and secretly poison Fok. Fok dies from poisoning after engaging Ishii Hideaki in a leitai match. Chan Zan remains calm in the face of taunts and insults from Ching-Mou's enemies after his master's death while channelling his efforts into disrupting the Japanese's plans to take over Shanghai. Many lives were lost in the struggle between Ching-mou School and the Japanese. Chan becomes the sole survivor of his school. After discovering that Takeda is planning to release a deadly virus in Shanghai and use that as an excuse for Japan to launch its invasion on China, Chan breaks into Takeda's base and takes down every opponent he meets and disrupts Takeda's plans once more. He defeats Takeda in a fight, but spares Takeda's life when Yumi pleads with him, but Takeda ultimately commits suicide in humiliation. Yumi is also gravely wounded by her father during the fight, and she succumbs to her wounds after Chan brings her back to Ching-mou School.

Shafia sisters Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, along with Rona Muhammad Omar, 40 (all of Afghan origin), were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in front of the northernmost Kingston Mills lock of the Rideau Canal. Zainab, Sahar, and Geeti were daughters of Mohammad Shafia, 58, and his wife, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 41. The couple also had a son, Hamed, 20, and three other children. Rona, who was herself infertile, was the first wife of Mohammad Shafia in their polygamous household. On July 23, 2009, Mohammad, Tooba Yahya, and Hamed were arrested on charges of four counts of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder under the guise of honour killing. The jury found them guilty of all four counts in January 2012. The trial, which took place at the Frontenac County Court House, was believed to be the first in Canada conducted in four languages ‚Äì English, French, Dari and Spanish.Jury selection for murder trial begins next week from The Kingston Whig-Standard. Retrieved November 24, 2011. The trial garnered media attention in Canada for several months and raised the debate over Canadian values, honour crimes, and violence among Muslim groups. Background In 1979 or 1980, Mohammad Shafia married Rona Mohammed. The couple did not have children, and medical tests confirmed that Rona was unable to have children. In keeping with Afghan custom, and at Rona's behest, Mohammad Shafia took Tooba Yahya as his second wife. The second wedding took place in 1989, and Rona features prominently in many wedding photographs, many of which feature Shafia flanked by his two wives. The three of them lived together in one household, as is customary, and Tooba gave birth to seven children. Rona participated fully in raising and caring for the children and bonded strongly with them, as though they were her own. Her relationship with her co-wife, however, was less idyllic. The Shafia family left Afghanistan in 1992. They moved to Australia for a brief time. Later, they relocated to the United Arab Emirates, where they lived for over a decade. Mohammad Shafia made a considerable fortune in Dubai, working in the used car business and later diversifying into real estate. By 2007, he was a multimillionaire. He soon decided to take advantage of an immigration program introduced by the government of Quebec in Canada which offered permanent residence and eventual citizenship to people who invested significant money in the province. Shafia invested $2 million in purchasing a strip-mall on the outskirts of Montreal; he invested a further $200,000 in building a spacious new house for his family. Shafia, his second wife Tooba, and their seven children immigrated to Canada and settled in the Saint-L√©onard borough of Montreal in 2007. Five months later, Shafia sponsored Rona's immigration, telling authorities that she was his cousin and that she would work as a cook and housekeeper.https://montrealgazette.com/news/Accused+says+heart+often+bleeds+cries+only+once+stand/5970215/story.html?id=5970215 According to a family member's interview, Rona was trapped in an abusive, loveless marriage, trying in vain to convince her husband to grant her a divorce. Rona's siblings claimed that she feared for her life during the days leading up to her death. Tooba allegedly said to Rona, \\"You are a slave; you are a servant.\\" Reportedly, the Shafias held all of Rona's identity documents, including her passport, so Rona believed she could not flee to another country where she had relatives. The Montreal Gazette reported that Rona emigrated to Canada as a domestic servant on a visitor's visa and that her husband and co- wife \\"held [the visa's renewal] over her head like an axe ready to fall.\\" The interviewed family member also stated that the Shafia family's eldest daughter, Zainab, was in a relationship with a Pakistani boy that elicited much anger from her father; the family member claimed to have overheard the father's threats to kill Zainab. With Mohammad Shafia, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, and their eldest son Hamed Shafia all in custody during the trial, the remaining Shafia children, two girls, and a boy, were being cared for under social services. Investigation On June 30, 2009, a worker at the Kingston Mills locks discovered a black Nissan Sentra with a broken left taillight submerged in the water. Divers discovered four female bodies floating inside. Mohammad Shafia was at the Kingston Police station to report that four of his family members ‚Äì three teenage daughters and a purported aunt ‚Äì were missing. Police initially believed that it was a tragic, if bizarre, accident; they first categorized it as a \\"sudden death investigation.\\" However, authorities soon learned that Hamed had reported an accident with the family Lexus SUV in an empty parking lot earlier that same morning in Montreal. Despite their suspicions, authorities did not have \\"reasonable and probable grounds\\" or sufficient evidence to ask a judge for a search warrant. Kingston Police Det. Steve Koopman, the liaison with the Shafia family, managed to gain the Shafia family's consent to view the Lexus. After assessing the damage on both vehicles, police theorized that the Lexus was used to ram the Nissan into the locks. It had been reported that the Shafia family purchased the used Nissan Sentra for CAD$5,000 one day before the family left Montreal for Niagara Falls. Trial Jury selection began on October 11, 2011, and the trial officially began on October 20. Ontario Superior Court Judge Robert Maranger presided over the trial. =Verdict= On January 29, 2012, after 15 hours of deliberation, a jury found each of the three defendants guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. In Canada, first-degree murder verdicts carry an automatic sentence of life without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Media coverage of the Shafia murder trial The coverage of the Shafia murder trial was widespread, often being on the front page of newspapers and the top story in TV newscasts. Since the case involved Afghan Canadians, questions arose as to whether or not it was correct, or even appropriate, to call the murders honour killings or simply domestic violence. While the judge who presided over the case referred to the deaths simply as murders, the media chose a different course when it called the murders \\"honour killings.\\" Across media outlets, the murder was framed as such. A publication ban placed on the case prevented the media from naming the three children who were still alive, with Hamed being the fourth. =CBC= CBC News covered the trials extensively from the first day; they went a step further by publishing its audience's comments to show how Canadians felt about the case and its details. The CBC stated that the story garnered many comments from the viewers but that they decided to only publish a select few. Furthermore, the CBC presented a \\"summary\\" of the comments and said that people generally \\"agreed with the verdict, applauding the court and the jury for its decision after the three- month trial.\\" =CTV= CTV News published a piece stating that the trial cast a shadow over Canada's Islamic community, further tarnishing an image that had not yet recovered from the events of 9/11. However, like other media outlets, CTV asked the Muslim community to clarify their stance on the issue of honour killing: \\"Muslims across the country, however, say the revelations in a Kingston, Ont., courtroom have shone a light on problematic aspects of their culture and illuminated new ways to tackle the issues.\\" CTV also published a timeline spanning the gamut from the Shafia family's days in Afghanistan to the events that took place in Canada. =Ottawa Citizen= Pascale Fournier, writing for The Ottawa Citizen, said that there was a greater tragedy in the failure of the state to intervene before the murders occurred. He also said that while vulnerable groups from immigrant communities need the most protection, they rarely get protection or help from authorities. =The Globe and Mail= In addition to covering every detail of the trial, The Globe and Mail published a piece with the \\"ten most shocking quotes\\" from the Shafia trial. One of the quotes was by Crown attorney Gerard Laarhuis after the verdicts, and it read as follows: \\"This jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family in the most troubling of circumstances. We all think of these four, wonderful women now who died needless deaths. This verdict sends a very clear message about our Canadian values and the core principles in a free and democratic society that all Canadians enjoy and even visitors to Canada enjoy.\\" This was one of the most criticized quotes by Afghan Canadians; they asserted that intolerance towards violence against women is not just a Canadian value, but a universal value. They also asserted that Afghans, like any other peoples, condemn the acts of the perpetrators. =Montreal Gazette= The Montreal Gazette published a column in which it said that labelling the murders as honour killing is a mistake because domestic violence against women is ubiquitous and framing it into a particular category would mean distancing oneself from a crime that is all too common. The authors argue that premeditation is put forth as a core component to differentiate honour killings from other types of murders, such as crimes of convenience or crimes of passion. However, recent studies indicate that premeditation is as much a component in other cases of domestic violence and murder as it is in \\"honour killings.\\" \\"Calling the murders \\"honour killings\\" accomplishes two goals. First, it makes it seem as if femicide is a highly unusual event. Second, it makes it seem as if femicide is confined to specific populations within Canada and specific national cultures or religions in the world at large. But Canadian statistics prove otherwise. According to StatsCan figures, from 2000 to 2009 an average of 58 women a year were killed in this country as a result of spousal violence. In that same period, 67 children and young people aged 12 to 17 were murdered by family members. In contrast, recent estimates tell us that there have been 12 or 13 so-called honour killings in Canada in the last decade. It does not take a genius to see that comparing 12 or 13 against the hundreds of women and children who were victims of familial violence serves only to frame \\"honour killing\\" as peculiar, when in reality it is part of a larger pattern of violence against women.\\" =Maclean's= Maclean's referred to the four murders as \\"honouricide.\\" Writer Michael Friscolanti sat throughout the three- month trial and wrote a 22-page comprehensive article detailing the girls' lives and even wrote about how one of the girls' tombstones has the incorrect birthdate. \\"In life, and in death, they had no voice,\\" Friscolanti wrote. \\"No one to save them. No one who even cares enough to fix Geeti's headstone. Nearly three years after she was buried, it is still engraved with Sahar's birth-date, not hers.\\" Reaction=Muslims in Canada= The murders gave rise to the debate about the relationship between honour killing and Islam. Islamic organizations based in Canada condemned the murders. The Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, along with other Canadian Muslim organizations, have publicly denounced domestic violence and honour killing as un-Islamic. Ali Falih Altaie, the family imam, said that the murders were unforgivable; he also cautioned against associating honour crimes with Islam, calling the actions incompatible with any religion. In 2012 imams from across Canada and the U.S. issued a moral ruling officially condemning honour killings, domestic violence, and misogyny as un-Islamic. Thirty-four imams belonging to the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, including a handful of American members, signed the fatwa in an effort to counter misinterpretations of the Qur'an. =Afghan Canadians= In an interview with CTVS News, the Afghan Embassy in Ottawa condemned the murders of the four members of the Shafia family. The embassy called the deaths of the three teenage sisters and their father's first wife a heinous crime against humanity. Moreover, they claimed that this kind of crime is not part of Afghan or Islamic culture and is not acceptable in any way.

It serves the Northeast Line (Route 202). It opened on August 27, 2012 as part of a 2.9-km (1.8 miles) extension from McKnight‚ÄìWestwinds station. It is the new terminus of the N.E. line and is located in the community of Saddle Ridge in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The station itself is located in the northwest corner of Saddletowne Circle N.E., a large roundabout which encompasses the Saddleridge Town Centre, a commercial and activity centre, with planned medium-density residential development and community facilities. The station has a Park and Ride with a 141-stall capacity. The station is a center- loading, walk-on island platform; very similar to McKnight-Westwinds and Somerset-Bridlewood stations. Construction on the extension started in the spring of 2010 and completed, for its grand opening block party, on August 25, 2012. The extension was delayed by almost one year, as it was initially planned to open in late 2011. In its first year of service, Saddletowne served an average of 8,730 boardings per day. Future Extension The Northeast line will be extended to the north, once those areas are developed enough to support LRT infrastructure. There are currently 4 stations planned: A station in the community of Savanna at 88th Avenue NE which will include a future spur line to the airport and the future green line, Country Hills Blvd near Skyview Ranch, 128th Avenue NE near Redstone and the future neighborhood of Cornerstone, and one near the industrial area of Stonegate.

All the actors, including Pl√°cido Domingo and Teresa Stratas in the starring roles, were opera singers who sang their own parts. Pagliacci was shot at Milan's La Scala opera house and on a movie sound stage. Georges Pr√™tre conducted the Orchestra and Choir of La Scala. The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. It was also shown on Italian and U.S. television and brought Zeffirelli an Emmy Award for Best Director in the category of Classical Music Programming. In 2003, Pagliacci was re-released on DVD by Deutsche Grammophon (having earlier been released by Philips/Decca on DVD), paired with Cavalleria rusticana (also starring Pl√°cido Domingo). Plot The story is set in southern Italy and recounts the tragedy of Canio, the lead clown (or pagliaccio in Italian) in a commedia dell'arte troupe, his wife Nedda, and her lover, Silvio. When Nedda spurns the advances of Tonio, another player in the troupe, he tells Canio about Nedda's betrayal. In a jealous rage Canio murders both Nedda and Silvio during a performance. Although Leoncavallo's opera was originally set in the late 1860s, Zeffirelli's production is updated to the period between World War I and World War II. Cast * Teresa Stratas as Nedda * Pl√°cido Domingo as Canio * Juan Pons as Tonio * Alberto Rinaldi as Silvio * Florindo Andreolli as Beppe * Alfredo Pistone as First Peasant * Ivan Del Manto as Second Peasant Production The Italian television network RAI had originally wanted to broadcast a live performance of Franco Zeffirelli's 1981 productions of Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci from the stage of La Scala. Zeffirelli, however, requested to be allowed to film the productions as if they were movies instead. In part, because both operas starred popular tenor Pl√°cido Domingo, Unitel agreed to help finance the project. Zeffirelli insisted that Canadian soprano Teresa Stratas play Nedda, even though she was not originally cast in the stage production. Over the course of only two days, the director filmed both works at the opera house when it was not in use. He had a wooden platform built over the front seats of the auditorium, where he placed his cameras to film the action onstage. He later did pick-up shots at an Italian film studio. Soundtrack For the movie's soundtrack, Georges Pr√™tre conducted the orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala in the opera house's orchestra pit, while each of the film's performers sang their own parts onstage while the cameras rolled. No audience, however, was present and it was recorded in segments. Pl√°cido Domingo, who had frequently performed the role of Canio onstage since 1966, previously recorded the opera in 1971 under Nello Santi. Philips Records released the film's soundtrack on LP in 1985 and CD in 1990. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Opera Recording. In a review of the soundtrack, the Montreal Gazette wrote: \\"Sound effects are included, which lend to the singing a credibility that you do not always feel on recordings.\\" The article also praised Domingo and Statas' singing and noted that the original analog recordings of the movie were digitally remastered prior to the soundtrack's release. Although they were filmed together, the Pagliacci recording was originally released separately from the soundtrack for Cavalleria rusticana.

MooseFS aims to be fault-tolerant, highly available, highly performing, scalable general-purpose network distributed file system for data centers. Initially proprietary software, it was released to the public as open source on May 30, 2008. Currently two editions of MooseFS are available: * MooseFS - released under GPLv2 license, * MooseFS Professional Edition (MooseFS Pro) - release under proprietary license in binary packages form. Design The MooseFS follows similar design principles as Fossil (file system), Google File System, Lustre or Ceph. The file system comprises three components: * Metadata server (MDS) ‚Äî manages the location (layout) of files, file access and namespace hierarchy. The current version of MooseFS does support multiple metadata servers and automatic failover. Clients only talk to the MDS to retrieve/update a file's layout and attributes; the data itself is transferred directly between clients and chunk servers. The Metadata server is a user-space daemon; the metadata is kept in memory and lazily stored on local disk. * Metalogger server ‚Äî periodically pulls the metadata from the MDS to store it for backup. Since version 1.6.5, this is an optional feature. * Chunk servers (CSS) ‚Äî store the data and optionally replicate it among themselves. There can be many of them, though the scalability limit has not been published. The biggest cluster reported so far consists of 160 servers. The Chunk server is also a user-space daemon that relies on the underlying local file system to manage the actual storage. * Clients ‚Äî talk to both the MDS and CSS. MooseFS clients mount the file system into user-space via FUSE. Features To achieve high reliability and performance MooseFS offers the following features: * Fault-tolerance ‚Äî MooseFS uses replication, data can be replicated across chunkservers, the replication ratio (N) is set per file/directory. If (N-1) replicas fail the data will still be available. At the moment MooseFS does not offer any other technique for fault-tolerance. Fault-tolerance for very big files thus requires vast amount of space - N*filesize instead of filesize+(N*stripesize) as would be the case for RAID 4, RAID 5 or RAID 6. Version 4.x PRO of MooseFS implements 8+n Erasure Coding. * Striping ‚Äî Large files are divided into chunks (up to 64 megabytes) that might be stored on different chunk servers in order to achieve higher aggregate bandwidth. * Load balancing ‚Äî MooseFS attempts to use storage resources equally, the current algorithm seems to take into account only the consumed space. * Security ‚Äî Apart from classical POSIX file permissions, since the 1.6 release MooseFS offers a simple, NFS-like, authentication/authorization. * Coherent snapshots ‚Äî Quick, low-overhead snapshots. * Transparent \\"trash bin\\" ‚Äî Deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time. * Data tiering / storage classes ‚Äî Possibility to \\"label\\" servers, create label definitions called \\"Storage Classes\\" and decide, on which types of servers the data is storedMooseFS 3.0 Storage Classes Manual https://moosefs.com/Content/Downloads/moosefs-storage-classes-manual.pdf * \\"Project\\" quotas support * POSIX locks, flock locks support Hardware, software and networking Similarly to other cluster-based file systems MooseFS uses commodity hardware running a POSIX compliant operating system.

From 2006 to 2008 he was the executive vice president of the Obesity Society, the medical and scientific society for obesity. While there, Downey initiated a program to develop a credential to recognize physicians specializing in the treatment of obesity and established a section of the Society dedicated to Health Services Research. He conducted a forum in 2007 \\"What Should the Next Administration Do About Obesity?\\" co-sponsored by the STOP Obesity Alliance and the National Journal. Nine presidential candidates (Senators Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Dodd, John Edwards, John McCain, Obama, and Governors Richardson and Mitt Romney and Mayor Rudy Giuliani) were represented, as was Peter Orszag, now President Obama's director of the Congressional Budget Office, then director of the Congressional Budget Office. The discussions were moderated by Linda Douglass, then with National Journal and now director of communications for the White House health care reform efforts. In 2008, Downey conducted similar forums at both the Democratic and Republican National Party Conventions. Participating in the forum at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, were Melody Barnes, now the White House director of Domestic Policy and Representative John Conyers, (D-MI), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Republican Forum, held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, was moderated by Lesley Stahl of CBS Sixty Minutes and featured former presidential candidate Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Tommy Thompson, former governor of Wisconsin and past Secretary of Health and Human Services. Due to these efforts, obesity was included for the first time in both parties' national platforms in 2008. In 1999, 2000 and 2001, Downey, at the American Obesity Association, conducted the first conferences on obesity as a public policy issue. The first AOA conference in 1999 featured Surgeon General David Satcher, the first time a surgeon general had directly addressed the obesity epidemic. In 2000, the AOA conference was the first in which representatives of the presidential campaigns, Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, addressed obesity and a survey AOA carried out on the attitudes of both parents to their children's weight. Communication disorders activism From 1988 to 1996, Mr. Downey led the National Coalition for Research on Neurological and Communicative Disorders (NCR). NCR successfully worked with the late Silvio Conte (R-MA) to pass the Congressional Resolution, signed by President George H.W. Bush, declaring the 1990s the \\"Decade of the Brain.\\" Mr. Downey helped establish the National Foundation for Brain Research whose it was to expand understanding of the advances in the neuroscience. The NFBR activities included supplements in the Washington Post and Scientific American and a study on the cost of disorders of the brain. Throughout the Decade, NFBR conducted a number of symposia for policy makers, the media and researchers on advances in neuroscience. NFBR also developed a museum exhibit with the Franklin Institute and seven other science museums. While in private practice Mr. Downey represented or directed several professional, scientific and patient organizations including the Council of Academic Programs in Communication Sciences and Disorders, the Academy for Neurologic Communication Disorders and the International Neural Network Society. Mr. Downey helped found the FSH Society, a patient led educational and advocacy organization which raises funds for research on facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and continues to serve as its general counsel. Prior to going into private practice, Mr. Downey was director of governmental and legal affairs for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the professional society for speech-language pathologists and audiologists and worked to include speech and hearing rehabilitation in Medicare, Medicaid, other federal programs, to expand clinical services to children and adults with disabilities, and to expand special education for children with speech, language and hearing difficulties. He led successful efforts for requiring judicial review of Medicare Part B benefits, Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration regulation of hearing aid sales, the hearing conservation regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the establishment of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and enactment of the Noise Control Act. Campaign financing activism Before joining ASHA, Mr. Downey worked for John Gardner at Common Cause on reforms of campaign financing laws, lobby disclosure and open meetings. He was very involved in an effort of Common Cause in Massachusetts to place a Good Government initiative on the ballot. The signature-gathering effort was successful and led to enactment of many of the reforms. Before that, he worked for Ralph Nader in establishing the reforms of the presidential campaign financing system and lobbying for higher penalties for corporate crime. The Washington Star-News of April 17, 1974 recognized him as one of the four lobbyists \\"working in a campaign to revolutionize the American system of money in politics.\\" Anti-war activism In the early 1970s, Downey was active in the anti-war movement including the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam in October 1968 and the demonstration in Washington in May 1970 following the invasion of Cambodia and the shootings at Kent State. That summer, Downey began working for Senator George McGovern on the McGovern- Hatfield amendment to cut off funding for the war in Viet Nam. As a conscientious objector, Downey performed alternate service with Americans for Indian Opportunity, a leading educational group for recognition of Native American civil rights. He worked on the legislation returning Taos Blue Lake to the traditional tribe and on the Indian Education Act. During law school, he worked on the staff of the McGovern-Fraser Commission on revisions to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination process. The committee is largely credited with replacing state conventions and party caucuses with presidential primaries to select delegates to the national convention. Personal Downey grew up in Brooklyn, New York and attended Xavier High School. He received his bachelor's degree in history from Fairfield University in 1968 and juris doctorate from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1971. Downey married journalist Dotty Lynch in 2003.

They were founded in 1924 by a gift from Hiram Messenger of \\"a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life\\", to be \\"delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable\\". The lecture series has been described as one of Cornell's most important of extracurricular activities. Initially a series of twelve lectures per year, there are now either three or six lectures by one speaker each semester. Archeologist James Henry Breasted delivered the first series of Messenger Lectures in 1925.  Hiram Messenger  Dr. Hiram John Messenger Jr (July 6, 1855 - Dec. 15, 1913; B. Litt., Phd,) was from Hartford, Connecticut and graduated from Cornell in 1880. He was a teacher of mathematics Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of the City of New York and an actuary of the Traveler's Insurance Company. The gift he left to Cornell was part of $4,000 mentioned in his will and a portion of his estate goes to Cornell each year. He was himself the youngest son of Hiram J. Messenger, a mercantile businessman and owner of banks. The lectures :See the list of Messenger Lectures at Cornell University for a complete list There have been over 80 talks given since 1924, the most famous of which is probably Richard Feynman's 7 lecture series in 1964, The Character of Physical Law, the videos of which were bought and made available to the public by Bill Gates in 2009.

Duclon and Gary Menteer, which aired on Fox from September 26 to November 28, 1987. The series was then revamped under the new title Boys Will Be Boys, and ran in the new format from January 16 to May 14, 1988. Second Chance In its original format, the show starred Kiel Martin as Charles Russell, a deceased man, and Matthew Perry as his younger self, who is nicknamed Chazz. On July 29, 2011, Charles dies in a hovercraft accident, and his soul is promptly sent to the high spiritual palace of Saint Peter (Joseph Maher). It is there that Saint Peter determines that Charles is too good for hell but not good enough to get into heaven; therefore, Charles is sent back to Earth in the year 1987, to re- join his life during the teenage years in order to help himself, through the younger Chazz, make more moral choices. Charles showed up at his childhood home with a different last name, Time, which he assumed from the magazine of the same name; it was also symbolic of his travel back through time and the extra amount of it he was awarded by Saint Peter. He came to rent out an apartment over the Russell garage when his feisty, sensible mother Helen (Randee Heller) needed a boarder to help make ends meet. Charles was a convenience store proprietor by day in between his efforts to reconnect with Chazz, who from the start had no idea that the new tenant hanging around and becoming buddy-like was in fact his older self. The two did form an instant friendship, and Chazz, who was in dire need of a resident father figure, often found himself turning to Charles (either directly or not) when life's dilemmas got too out of hand. Chazz's two best friends were tough, supercool Francis \\"Booch\\" Lottabucci (Billy Gallo) and awkward, geeky Eugene Blooberman (Demian Slade), the latter of which was tolerated by Chazz but always regularly put down by Booch. As the boys cooked up schemes, encountered teenage romance and got into trouble, Charles was there to be the voice of reason, even if Booch and Eugene didn't understand why he was involved. In turn, Saint Peter, grading Charles' progress in his effort to grow into a new man the second time around, watched over him like a hawk. He, however, could only be seen or heard by Charles. The early episodes focused on the Russell's efforts to keep the family home, in wake of Helen's ex-husband (played in guest appearances by Richard Kline) becoming six months behind on his alimony. In the pilot episode, Booch talks Chazz into disguising themselves as older men to purchase lottery tickets, with the idea of eventually stealing from the convenience store if they didn't win the jackpot. It just happened to be the older Charles' convenience store they came to; Charles watched himself (Chazz) and Booch attempt to get away with their plan. He then stepped in and began gently manipulating them with sage advice in order to get the boys (namely himself) to do the right thing. Despite nearly everyone in the picture not catching on to the fact that Charles Time was really the older Chazz Russell, it was Helen who always exclaimed the similarities that both Charles and Chazz had in their behaviors (i.e. synchronizing their movements of picking up utensils and drinking milk at the kitchen table, at the same time) and even in their looks. By the end of November sweeps, ratings were unsatisfactory even by the standards of the young Fox network, which had yet to rival the established broadcast networks in audience size. Second Chance left the air briefly, as Duclon, Menteer, and company set out to retool the show. = Colonel Gaddafi \\"prediction\\" = In the opening scene for the pilot, as a throwaway joke, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi is shown being judged after his death, with the date given as July 29, 2011. In the year after the Berlin discotheque bombing and the U.S. response, the 1987 pilot was playing off Gaddafi's prominent negative perception by the American public. Twenty-four years later, by coincidence, Gaddafi's death (on October 20, 2011) occurred within three months of the \\"predicted\\" date and was from the same cause (multiple gunshot wounds). Boys Will Be Boys After a little over a month off the air, the series returned in January 1988 under a new title, Boys Will Be Boys. In this revamp, the supernatural element was dropped, causing Kiel Martin and Joseph Maher to exit the cast. As the new title implied, the format now revolved solely around the antics of Chazz, Booch and Eugene. Helen was by now in a much better financial situation, and was able to keep the family home. This was also evidenced by a three-part excursion the cast took to Las Vegas as the retooled series began. Booch, whose alcoholic father had just died, had moved in with the Russells‚Äîbut not into the main house itself. With the apartment over the garage now tenantless, Chazz and Booch decided to move in there together, getting a taste of independence and the roommate experience already in high school. Eugene, of course, always dropped by to share in their escapades and to annoy Booch. Two new characters were added to the show, who had previously made guest appearances on Second Chance. Debbie Miller (Terri Ivens), Chazz's main love interest since first grade, had broken up with Chazz during her early guest shot on the show, but, now on full-time, began to romantically drift back to Chazz‚Äîonly after dating others first. The two soon resumed being an item. Also joining the cast was Alex (Adam Sadowsky), who, in his Second Chance guest appearances, made friends with Chazz and revealed to the older Charles Russell that he was also on a mission for God. This character history was disregarded for Boys Will Be Boys, as Alex was now a classmate/friend to Booch and Eugene as well as Chazz. Although the format was tweaked, the series was moved around Fox's Saturday night schedule a few more times, and was then cancelled at the end of the season. After the last original episode of Boys Will Be Boys aired on May 14, 1988, repeats aired through July 2 of that year.

Duclon and Gary Menteer, Second Chance initially had many production values similar to that of another one of their programs, Punky Brewster. Both shows had surrogate father figure leads as co-stars (Martin's Charles Russell on Second Chance and George Gaynes' Henry Warnimont, adoptive father of the title character of Punky). The Second Chance theme song, a warm rock ballad titled \\"I Gotta Go Back\\", was composed by Bob Wirth and Rik Howard, who had been the composers on most Duclon/Menteer shows, including Punky Brewster. The theme music, in fact, used the same instrumentation and pitch as the Punky theme. During the episodes of the series that ran under the title Second Chance, yellow Optima font was used for the credits, which was then currently seen on Punky Brewster. Also, Punky Brewster featured a \\"tough kid\\" character in Season 1 named Scotty Lottabucci - a surname recycled in Second Chance. In yet another similarity, the reference of Time magazine was used on both shows. In a Season 2 Punky Brewster episode, Henry, Punky, and their dog Brandon have a family photo taken in Henry's new photography studio, which is superimposed into an actual shell cover of Time with the fictional headline \\"Father of the Year\\". It appears that Duclon and Menteer were fans of the publication. Once the series became Boys Will Be Boys, the theme song was revamped so that it was in a slightly higher pitch, but now as an instrumental, jazzy version dominated by saxophone and electric guitar. The newer version of the theme, and the musical cues that also changed, came to be a forerunner of the hipper, more irreverent sound that would soon permeate through other Fox shows. The credit font also changed, but otherwise the familiar production traits of Duclon and Menteer remained. Adam Sadowsky was hired to become a regular on Boys Will Be Boys after having worked under Duclon's past creative partner, Michael G. Moye, on It's Your Move (NBC, 1984‚Äì85). Before It's Your Move, Duclon and Moye had been producers on NBC's Silver Spoons. By 1987, both Moye and Duclon had development deals with the fledgling Fox network, with Moye being a co-creator of one of Fox's most popular freshman series, Married... with Children.

Built on a spur overlooking the gorge of the Mangde River, a temple was first established at the location in 1543 by the Drukpa lama, Nagi Wangchuk son of Ngawang Chhojey. In 1647, his great-grandson Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (Shabdrung or Zhabdrung being his title),Dorje (1999), p. 856. constructed the first dzong to replace it, called Ch√∂khor Rabtentse Dzong with a shorter version of Choetse Dzong. It was enlarged several times during the 18th century; the Chenrezig Lhakang was built in 1715 and a whole complex, including the Maitreya (Jampa) temple, was added in 1771. The dzong has since been repaired on several occasions; it was damaged during the 1897 Assam earthquake and underwent extensive renovation in 1927 and 1999.Pommaret (2006), p.211. Trongsa Dzong, the largest dzong at a striking location, is an important administrative building, providing the headquarters of the government of Trongsa District. Trongsa provides a strategic central location to control Bhutan and for centuries it was the seat of the Wangchuck dynasty of penlops (governors) who effectively ruled over much of eastern and central Bhutan, and from 1907 have been Kings of Bhutan. It is also a major monastic complex, with around 200 monks. During the summer months, the monastic community often relocates to Kurje Monastery in the Bumthang Valley. It contains a notable printing house, responsible for the printing of many religious texts in Bhutan.).Dorje (1999), p. 856.Pommaret (2006), p.212 It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion. Geography The Dzong and the small town surrounding it are situated on a spur, a wild rocky area, above the ravines of the Mangde Chuu valley with the scenic backdrop of the Black Mountains on its southwest. The Dzong is located above the fast flowing Mandge Chu in a unique setting that has been described as \\"the most spectacularly sited dzong in Bhutan with a sheer drop to the south that often disappears into cloud and mist\\". Chorten in Nepalese style at Pele La on the foot track to Trongsa Dzong. Approach to Trongsa, till 1970, was only from the upper reaches of the Mangde Chu valley, starting the descent to the Trongsa town and the dzong from the location of two small chortens at Chendebji (One built by Lama Shida in Nepali style in the 18th century and the other a new one built in Bhutanese style in 1982)Dorje (1999), p. 856.), which is away along foot tracks, after crossing the Pela La pass (). This trackroute traverses through farms, deciduous forests, crosses side streams, raises to Tangsibji village before descending to the Mangde Chu valley. The vegetation seen along the route consists of shrubs of edgeworthia (high altitude dwarf bamboo), which are used for making paper. Fauna encountered on this route are mainly brown monkeys - the rhesus macaques. En route at Tashiling, a new Potala Lhakhang could be seen alongside a wrathful statue of Guru Rinpoche. The Potala Lhakhang was built in 2005 and is housing a high statue of Chenresig. Arriving at the head of the valley brings a spectacular view of the very large white Trashi Dzong. From Thimpu, the capital city on the west, the journey is by road, of about 7 hours, passing through mountain ranges on the east and west directions. The road is aligned above the Dzong, passes through a vegetable market and then through a small palace. This palace is where the late king Jigme Dorji Wangchuk (the third king of Butan) was born in 1928. History Trongsa means \\"the new village\\" in Bhutanese, which comprises retreats, temples and hermitages of monks. Its rich history is traced to the founding of a temple in the area by the Drukpa lama, Ngagi Wangchuk, ancestor of Shabdrung Namgyal, who came to this place from Ralung in 1541, and built a small meditation room in 1543. One day he had been meditating nearby in a village called Yuling and witnessed a light (\\"from a body of lamps\\") at the furthest point of the spur. He believed this to be an auspicious sign and erected a temple on the spot, on a mountain spur high above the gorges of the Mangde Chhu, at an altitude of . Note: the altitude is given as by Dorje. Another version for building a temple here is that Ngagi Wangchuk saw self- manifest hoof prints of a horse that belonged to the Protector deity Palden Lhamo. He then decided to build a small meditation centre, a tshamkhang, at that location. One more version of the legend states that Ngagi Wangchuk after witnessing the lights from lamps, went into a cave nearby for meditation where he found a small spring. He also visioned that the spring had been used by the Mahakali (Peldon Lhamo) for sacred ablutions with other dakinis. He then built a small temple, which has now become the main temple Gunkhang. He also developed it into a small village with several houses and the place thus came to be known as drongsar (\\"new village\\") and popularly known in the local dialect as 'Trongsa'. He further inferred from the shape of the rocky hill, that it was in the form a conch shell with concentric rings (in clockwise direction) and hence named the monastery as Choe-Khor-Rab-Ten-Tse or by a shorter version as Chotse that represents \\" the temple fixed firmly at the tip of the dharma wheel-the conchshell\\". The original temple site is today located at the end of the dzong, at the Temple of Chortens. Panorama of Trongsa Dzong. In 1647, the great-grandson of Ngagi Wangchuk, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, noted for the building of several other prominent buildings in Bhutan, began constructing a dzong in Trongsa, given its strategical importance. He named it the Ch√∂khor Rabtentse Dzong and it was the seat of power of the Wangchuck dynasty before they became rulers of Bhutan in 1907. The rulers of Trongsa, the penlops of the Wangchuck dynasty, who resided at Trongsa Dzong were very powerful, exerting influence over all of eastern and central Bhutan, controlling east-west trade for centuries. The only road connecting eastern and western Bhutan (the precursor to the modern Lateral Road), passed through the courtyard of the dzong. By the 19th century, the penlops, ruling from Trongsa Dzong, had become so powerful that Trongsa had effectively become the capital of Bhutan, although never officially so. Its strategic location added to its importance on the east-west trade route and was a source of revenue to the Trongsa penlop. They later became the monarchs of Bhutan that rule to this day. Sir Ugyen Wangchuck, the first ruler of Bhutan was the Penlop at Trongsa before he was crowned the King of Bhutan in 1907. However, he retained the position of Penlop as well.Dorje (1999), p. 856. In 1652, Minjur Tempa, the then Penlop of Trongsa, had the dzong enlarged. In 1715, the Penlop Druk Dendrup built the Chenrezig (Avalokiteshvara) Lhakang and in 1765, Penlop Zhidar established a monastic community of around 50 monks at the dzong. In 1771, a whole complex, including the Maitreya (Jampa) temple was added to provide for the monks. In 1853, the 10th Penlop of Trongsa, Jigme Namgyal, who was the father of the first king. erected the Demchog (Cakrasamvara) Lhakhang, in the central section of the dzong. Trongsa Dzong was heavily damaged following the 1897 Assam earthquake. It underwent major repair and was restored by both the 1st king, Ugyen Wangchuck and the 2nd king, Jigme Wangchuck in 1927, who renovated the Chenrezig Lhakhang in particular. In 1999, funding from Austria led to extensive restoration works and was reconsecrated in October 2004, coinciding with the enthronement of the Crown Prince. The old village of Trongsar is located below, but there is a new village of Trongsar, which has been under construction on the mountainside since 1982. Tibetan immigrants settled in the valley in late 1950s and early 1960. The shopkeepers are mainly of Bhutanese and Tibetan origin. Architecture General view of Trongsa dzong. Interior courtyard in Trongsa Dzong. Trongsa Dzong is a powerfully built fortress and is exemplary of dzong architecture. The Trongsa Dzong is an extensive complex; the largest in all of Bhutan, and is set on many different levels. It consists of a maze of courtyards, passageways and corridors and the complex contains as many as 25 temples. The most important temples are those dedicated to the Tantric deities of YamƒÅntaka, Hevajra, Cakrasa·πÉvara and KƒÅlacakra. The Maitreya (Jampa) temple was erected in 1771 and today contains a clay statue of the Buddha of the Future, donated by King Ugyen Wangchuck in the early 20th century. The Temple of Chortens is located on the spot where the original 1543 temple had stood. It contains the funerary chorten of Ngagi Wangchuk and has 16 paintings of the Arhats and of the Buddha Akshobhya (Mitrugpa). The watchtower of the fortress, named Ta Dzong, towers above the gorge to the east side of the dzong. The watchtower is narrow and has two wings that project in a v-shape from the main part of the building.Pommaret, p. 213 It also contains a temple, established in 1977 to honour the warrior god, King Gesar. In 2008, a museum was added to this complex, following Austrian donations. The interior decorations in the temples are attributed to the time of the reign of the first ruler, king Ugyen Wangchuk. However, the Dzong has undergone renovations in recent years with assistance provided by an Austrian team. The original design of the northern assembly hall, an original court scene with mural paintings of the guardians of four directions, Phurba statue in the main hall, a mural replica of Swayambunath temple of Nepal and a pictorial map of Lhasa are retained.Brown, p.164 left Ta Dzong, the watch tower, that was in the past a stronghold against internal insurgencies, towering over the east side of the dzong, has since been converted into a state-of-the Art Museum (National Museum) with technical and financial support provided by Austria. The tower also houses a chapel dedicated to the Jigme Namgyal who was penlop in the 19th century. It is also stated that in the dungeon of the tower two British soldiers were imprisoned during the Duar War.Brown, p.164 The Ta Dzong tower originally was a highly fortified six-storied tower, with numerous galleries in the thick walls for defense. Further fortifications in the form of three independent towers were added at a higher elevation in close vicinity of the Ta Dzong. Aside from its central administrative offices, Trongsa is a major monastery and today houses around 200 monks. They are also affiliated Kurje Monastery in the Choekhor Valley of Bumthang and some of them often spend their summers at Kurje. An important printing house is also located at the dzong, where printing of religious texts is done by traditional woodblock printing. Festival A five-day festival known as the Trongsa tsechu is held in the northern courtyard of the temple during December or January.Brown, p.164 Every monastery in Bhutan observes this festival, which celebrates the arrival of Guru Rimpoche to Bhutan in the 8th century, a mark of triumph of Buddhism over evil. It is held in spring and autumn seasons according to the Bhutanese calendar and masked dances are a popular feature along with the exposition of a very large thanka (religious painting) on cloth of Guru Rimpoche and other figures called the thongdrel. A fire blessing in the form of people running through \\"an archway of blazing straw\\" is also witnessed.

Biography She began to write stories when she was seven, and studied Classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, graduating in 1918. She returned home after Oxford to work for her family's engineering firm and wrote her first novel, The Lighted Room in 1925. She spent a year as associate editor at Time and Tide. Her novel The New House (1936) describes the events of a single day. National Provincial (1938) depicts 'Aire', a city based on Leeds, during the 1930s. The characters cover a wide social range, and many are involved in left-wing politics. A main thread of the novel is the conflict between militant and moderate socialists, which finds bitter expression in the course of an unofficial strike, and during a Parliamentary election campaign. During the Second World War Lettice Cooper worked for the Ministry of Food's public relations division. Black Bethlehem (1947) is an unusually-structured novel, a psychological study of wartime and postwar anxieties on the battlefield and on the Home Front. The novel reflects her strong interest in psychoanalysis. Cooper met Eileen Blair (George Orwell's wife) during the war, and is thought to have used her as the basis for the character of Ann in Black Bethlehem. In an account, printed in Orwell Remembered, Cooper recalled that Eileen described how Orwell read each installment of Animal Farm to her each evening and she came in each morning to tell her co-workers how the book was developing.Orwell:Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, pp. 325‚Äì326 Between 1947 and 1957 Cooper was fiction reviewer for the Yorkshire Post.

The estate best known because one of its owners was Nobel Prize-winning author Knut Hamsun. History N√∏rholm was one of the more notable and historic farms of the traditional district Agder. The manor historically belonged to noble families often of Danish origin. The property was bought by Knut Hamsun in 1918, and since then has been owned by members of the Hamsun family. The financial award associated with the Nobel Prize made it possible for Knut Hamsun to expand the property significantly, and to live a life as farmer, much like the protagonist of his novel Growth of the Soil which had earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The current main building is from 1830, but was expanded by Hamsun in a neoclassical style. He also built several roads on the property. N√∏rholm conservation was established in 1989 through the will of Ellinor (1915-1987), the daughter of Knut Hamsun and Marie Hamsun. The N√∏rholm Foundation (Stiftelsen N√∏rholm) was created in 1995 by Victoria Hamsun, the daughter of Arild Hamsun (1914-1988) who was Knut and Marie's youngest son. The property is managed by Victoria Hamsun in cooperation with the N√∏rholm Foundation. The S√∏rvika cottage was separated from the property and owned by Knut's son, Tore.

Founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, they marketed several scooter designs.  History  The company was co-founded in 2008 by Ann Arbor area residents John Harding, an entrepreneur and electric vehicle enthusiast, and Erik Kauppi, an engineer and inventor. Both had prior experience in the Detroit-area automotive industry. Having imported and evaluated several Chinese-made electric scooters, and, not being satisfied with their features or quality, Harding joined with Kauppi to develop their own vehicle. Over the following two years several electric maxi-scooter models were developed using a maxi-scooter chassis made by Jonway of Zhejiang, China, Lithium iron phosphate battery cells and multi-phase rear wheel hub motors. The pair also engineered their own battery management system, wiring harness, digital instrument panel, vehicle telematics system, swing arm, battery box, and suspension. These vehicles were introduced as the C Series, consisting of the C130, C124, and C120 models, each with differing levels of power, range, top speed, curb weight, and MSRP. A \\"Test Pilot\\" program championed by former GM executive and investor Bob Lutz allowed early adopters to purchase a scooter at a discounted price in return for providing feedback and serving as a testbed for the vehicle's telematics software and other systems. Lutz also chaired Current Motor's Advisory Council. In 2011, Belle Capital, LP, a Michigan-based early stage angel fund, acquired majority ownership of the company and Lauren Flanagan was named President, replacing Harding (who subsequently left the company in 2012). In late 2013 the company introduced their \\"Mini Fleet\\" package that included four C-Series scooters paired with a mobile solar charging station. In February, 2015 the \\"Mini-Fleet-in-a-Box\\" was introduced along with the \\"Nb\\" scooter, which, in contrast to the C-Series, was based on a chassis totally designed and manufactured in-house.

The language is developed by the XML Query working group of the W3C. The work is closely coordinated with the development of XSLT by the XSL Working Group; the two groups share responsibility for XPath, which is a subset of XQuery. XQuery 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on January 23, 2007. XQuery 3.0 became a W3C Recommendation on April 8, 2014. XQuery 3.1 became a W3C Recommendation on March 21, 2017. Features XQuery is a functional, side effect-free, expression-oriented programming language with a simple type system, summed up by Kilpel√§inen: XQuery provides the means to extract and manipulate data from XML documents or any data source that can be viewed as XML, such as relational databases\\"Data retrieval with XQuery\\". Retrieved on 18 January 2016. or office documents. XQuery contains a superset of XPath expression syntax to address specific parts of an XML document. It supplements this with a SQL-like \\"FLWOR expression\\" for performing joins. A FLWOR expression is constructed from the five clauses after which it is named: FOR, LET, WHERE, ORDER BY, RETURN. The language also provides syntax allowing new XML documents to be constructed. Where the element and attribute names are known in advance, an XML-like syntax can be used; in other cases, expressions referred to as dynamic node constructors are available. All these constructs are defined as expressions within the language, and can be arbitrarily nested. The language is based on the XQuery and XPath Data Model (XDM) which uses a tree-structured model of the information content of an XML document, containing seven kinds of nodes: document nodes, elements, attributes, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, and namespaces. XDM also models all values as sequences (a singleton value is considered to be a sequence of length one). The items in a sequence can either be XML nodes or atomic values. Atomic values may be integers, strings, booleans, and so on: the full list of types is based on the primitive types defined in XML Schema. Features for updating XML documents or databases, and full text search capability, are not part of the core language, but are defined in add-on extension standards: XQuery Update Facility 1.0 supports update feature and XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 supports full text search in XML documents. XQuery 3.0 adds support for full functional programming, in that functions are values that can be manipulated (stored in variables, passed to higher-order functions, and dynamically called). Examples The sample XQuery code below lists the unique speakers in each act of Shakespeare's play Hamlet, encoded in hamlet.xml { for $act in doc(\\"hamlet.xml\\")//ACT let $speakers := distinct- values($act//SPEAKER) return # { string($act/TITLE) } { for $speaker in $speakers return * { $speaker } } } All XQuery constructs for performing computations are expressions. There are no statements, even though some of the keywords appear to suggest statement-like behaviors. To execute a function, the expression within the body is evaluated and its value is returned. Thus to write a function to double an input value, one simply writes: declare function local:doubler($x) { $x * 2 } To write a full query saying 'Hello World', one writes the expression: \\"Hello World\\" This style is common in functional programming languages. Applications Below are a few examples of how XQuery can be used: #Extracting information from a database for use in a web service. #Generating summary reports on data stored in an XML database. #Searching textual documents on the Web for relevant information and compiling the results. #Selecting and transforming XML data to XHTML to be published on the Web. #Pulling data from databases to be used for the application integration. #Splitting up an XML document that represents multiple transactions into multiple XML documents. XQuery and XSLT compared=Scope= Although XQuery was initially conceived as a query language for large collections of XML documents, it is also capable of transforming individual documents. As such, its capabilities overlap with XSLT, which was designed expressly to allow input XML documents to be transformed into HTML or other formats. The XSLT 2.0 and XQuery standards were developed by separate working groups within W3C, working together to ensure a common approach where appropriate. They share the same data model (XDM), type system, and function library, and both include XPath 2.0 as a sublanguage. =Origin= The two languages, however, are rooted in different traditions and serve the needs of different communities. XSLT was primarily conceived as a stylesheet language whose primary goal was to render XML for the human reader on screen, on the web (as web template language), or on paper. XQuery was primarily conceived as a database query language in the tradition of SQL. Because the two languages originate in different communities, XSLT is stronger in its handling of narrative documents with more flexible structure, while XQuery is stronger in its data handling (for example, when performing relational joins). =Versions= XSLT 1.0 appeared as a Recommendation in 1999, whereas XQuery 1.0 only became a Recommendation in early 2007; as a result, XSLT is still much more widely used. Both languages have similar expressive power, though XSLT 2.0 has many features that are missing from XQuery 1.0, such as grouping, number and date formatting, and greater control over XML namespaces. Many of these features were planned for XQuery 3.0. Any comparison must take into account the fact that XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 are very different languages. XSLT 2.0, in particular, has been heavily influenced by XQuery in its move to strong typing and schema-awareness. =Strengths and weaknesses= Usability studies have shown that XQuery is easier to learn than XSLT, especially for users with previous experience of database languages such as SQL.Usability of XML Query Languages. Joris Graaumans. SIKS Dissertation Series No 2005-16, This can be attributed to the fact that XQuery is a smaller language with fewer concepts to learn, and to the fact that programs are more concise. It is also true that XQuery is more orthogonal, in that any expression can be used in any syntactic context. By contrast, XSLT is a two-language system in which XPath expressions can be nested in XSLT instructions but not vice versa. XSLT is currently stronger than XQuery for applications that involve making small changes to a document (for example, deleting all the NOTE elements). Such applications are generally handled in XSLT by use of a coding pattern that involves an identity template that copies all nodes unchanged, modified by specific templates that modify selected nodes. XQuery has no equivalent to this coding pattern, though in future versions it will be possible to tackle such problems using the update facilities in the language that are under development. XQuery 1.0 lacked any kind of mechanism for dynamic binding or polymorphism; this has been remedied with the introduction of functions as first-class values in XQuery 3.0. The absence of this capability starts to become noticeable when writing large applications, or when writing code that is designed to be reusable in different environments. XSLT offers two complementary mechanisms in this area: the dynamic matching of template rules, and the ability to override rules using \`xsl:import\`, that make it possible to write applications with multiple customization layers. The absence of these facilities from XQuery 1.0 was a deliberate design decision: it has the consequence that XQuery is very amenable to static analysis, which is essential to achieve the level of optimization needed in database query languages. This also makes it easier to detect errors in XQuery code at compile time. The fact that XSLT 2.0 uses XML syntax makes it rather verbose in comparison to XQuery 1.0. However, many large applications take advantage of this capability by using XSLT to read, write, or modify stylesheets dynamically as part of a processing pipeline. The use of XML syntax also enables the use of XML-based tools for managing XSLT code. By contrast, XQuery syntax is more suitable for embedding in traditional programming languages such as Java (see XQuery API for Java) or C#. If necessary, XQuery code can also be expressed in an XML syntax called XQueryX. The XQueryX representation of XQuery code is rather verbose and not convenient for humans, but can easily be processed with XML tools, for example transformed with XSLT stylesheets. Extensions and future work=W3C extensions= Two major extensions to the XQuery were developed by the W3C: * XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full- TextXQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 * XQuery Update Facility Both reached Recommendation status as extensions to XQuery 1.0, but work on taking them forward to work with XQuery 3.0 was abandoned for lack of resources. Work on XQuery 3.0 was published as a Recommendation on 8 April 2014,XML Query (XQuery) 3.0 and XQuery 3.1 is a Recommendation as at February 2017. A scripting (procedural) extension for XQuery was designed, but never completed.XQuery Scripting Extension 1.0 RequirementsXQuery 1.0 Scripting Extension The EXPath Community GroupEXPath Community Group develops extensions to XQuery and other related standards (XPath, XSLT, XProc, and XForms).

He founded the empirical brand of philosophy known as Australian realism. Anderson's promotion of 'free thought' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists‚Äîsome of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the 'sexual revolution' of the 1950s and 1960s. To Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society. Early life Anderson was born in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, Scotland and educated at the former Hamilton Academy from which school he won a bursary to attend the University of Glasgow in the university's Bursary Competition of 1911.Online Dictionary of Australian BiographyUniversity of Sydney ‚Äì John Anderson Archive ‚Äì photograph ‚Äì winners of the University of Glasgow Bursary competition, Hamilton Academy 1911 Retrieved 20 October 2010 Anderson was listed among notable former pupils of Hamilton Academy in a 1950 magazine article on the school.Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association Magazine, February 1950, feature on Hamilton Academy in the article series 'Famous Scottish Schools' His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College, 1921 to his death in 1955, and described as \\"the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.\\"Weblin, Mark \\"Idealism in Australia and New Zealand\\" The Northern Line No. 3 May 2007, p 6. Retrieved 17 January 2011 Anderson graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1917, with first-class honours in Philosophy (Logic and Moral Philosophy), and first-class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. After graduation, he was awarded the Ferguson Scholarship in Philosophy and the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship, the examinations for which were open to graduates of any of the four Scottish universities.The Challis Chair: Prof John Anderson's Appointment Sydney Morning Herald, 7 December 1926, p 12 He served as Assistant in Philosophy at the University College, Cardiff (Cardiff) (1917‚Äì19), in Moral Philosophy and Logic in the University of Glasgow (1919‚Äì20) and lectured in Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh (1920‚Äì26). Social theory After arriving in Sydney in 1927 he associated with the Communist Party of Australia and contributed to their journals, sometimes under a nom de plume but, by about 1932 he began to believe that communism under Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union was a dictatorship with no room for workers' control or participation. He then became aligned with the Trotskyist movement for a period of time. But \\"[h]e could not put up any longer with dialectical materialism or with the servile state which he saw was being imposed by the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat\\".Russia: Is She Approaching a Crisis? The Northern Standard, 2 August 1935, at Trove Anderson later abandoned authoritarian forms of socialism and became what would today be called a libertarian and pluralist‚Äîan opponent of all forms of authoritarianism. Sometimes he described himself as an anarchist but, after the 1930s, he gave up his earlier political utopianism. Advocacy of academic freedom As Sydney University's Challis Professor of Philosophy, Anderson was a formidable champion of the principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the British Medical Association in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit‚Äîthe Sydney University Regiment‚Äîand lived to see the day in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire. (The regiment was subsequently rehoused at a new facility on university-owned land at Darlington.)Sydney University Regiment Presentation of the Queen's and Regimental Colours Historical exposition at Regimental Books website Anderson was censured by the Sydney University Senate in 1931 after criticising the role of war memorials in sanctifying war.University professor censured The Brisbane Courier 22 July 1931, p.19, at Trove, National Library of AustraliaAnderson's reply to the Senate was published the same week. (Sydney Morning Herald, 24 July 1931, p.10, at Trove, National Library of Australia) In 1943 he was censured by the Parliament of New South Wales after arguing that religion has no place in schools. He founded the Sydney University Free Thought Society\\"No Political Freedom. Professor Anderson's Address.\\" Sydney Morning Herald, 11 July 1931, at Trove which ran from 1931 to 1951. He was president of the society throughout that period. It is legendary that the university's Senate, accepting that it could not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of \\"Moral and Political Philosophy\\" to which Alan Stout was appointed.Armstrong D. M. Obituary: Alan Ker Stout (1900‚Äì1983) in Australian Academy of the Humanities Obituary: Alan Ker Stout, 1900‚Äì1983 at Australian Academy of the Humanities, Proceedings 1982-3 pp.106‚Äì109 This purpose was not achieved, as Anderson continued to lecture on ethics and politics. Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who \\"brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for putting things simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view\\". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'. Thought and influence As a committed empiricist, Anderson argued that there is only one realm of \\"being\\" and it can be best understood through science and naturalistic philosophy. He asserted that there is no supernatural god and that there are no non-natural realms along the lines of Platonic ideals. He rejected all notions that knowledge could be obtained by means other than descriptions of facts and any belief that revelation or mysticism could be sources for obtaining truth. He was arguing that traditional Christian concepts of good and evil were only meant for slaves and that, in actuality, the idea of morality was empty. For Anderson, the term \\"good\\" was valid when applied objectively to human activities which were free, critical and creative but the more common subjective applications were to be avoided or exposed as deceptive. Not surprisingly, Anderson's influence was both extensive and controversial as he constantly examined and fearlessly criticised hallowed beliefs and institutions. > He is, arguably, the most important philosopher who has worked in Australia. > Certainly he was the most important in both the breadth and depth of > influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual > formation from Anderson are John Passmore, John Mackie, A.J. ('Jim') Baker, > David Stove and myself. There are lots more.

I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties > of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the > tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney.Armstrong D M Address on 9 July > 2005 John Anderson Remembered ‚Äì David Armstrong (2005) Anderson's influence has spread through his personal impact on several generations of students, the \\"Andersonians\\", who include the philosophers named above, together with Hedley Bull and Eugene Kamenka; the World War II organiser Alf Conlon, many members of the Sydney Push, Tonga's 'I. Futa Helu, and jurist John Kerr, later to be Australia's best-remembered governor- general. Free Thought Society and the Sydney Libertarians Anderson's insistence on unceasing inquiry and criticism became central to the intellectual principles of the university's Libertarian Society which supplanted the Free Thought Society in the early 1950s and provided a philosophic platform for the much broader subculture known as \\"the Push\\" throughout the 1960s. He was a defender of free speech and was critical of the Australian government's bans on certain political publications (1928). He advocated religious and sexual freedoms and free discussion of issues in an era when mention of taboo subjects commonly resulted in angry public condemnation by prominent moralists. After the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more conservative views. Jim Baker interprets this latter stage not so much as \\"a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest\\". In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the 1949 coal miners' strike, for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers. At a Free Thought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to oppose conscription for the war in Korea. In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Free Thought Society to canvass the 'No' case for Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the referendum of that year. This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Free Thought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party‚Äîin fact he attacked the proposal.Weblin, Mark (ed.), A Perilous and Fighting Life: From Communist to Conservative: The Political Writings of Professor John Anderson (North Melbourne: Pluto Press, 2003)) The Free Thought Society held its last meeting in 1951. The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969. Anderson broke off contact with the former disciples who formed the Libertarian Society and never associated with \\"Push\\" people who routinely sang his praises along with the bawdy songs he had imported to his new country.Ballad of Professor John Glaister is one example, some of the words of which have been published in Snatches & Lays (Sun Books, Melbourne, 1975) However, even after retirement in 1958 and to the brink of his death in 1962, he was seen daily in his study, continuing his work and reviewing earlier work. Among his last publications were Classicism (1960), Empiricism and Logic (1962) and Relational Arguments (1962).Anderson, J.

Goosby treated patients at San Francisco General Hospital when HIV/AIDS first began to emerge and take its toll in the early 1980s. In 1986, he served as the AIDS activity division attending physician, and in 1987 was appointed associate medical director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic. During his time at San Francisco General, he helped develop effective models for HIV/AIDS clinical care for intravenous drug users, establishing three medical facilities located in methadone treatment centers.We're sorry, that page can't be found = Government service = Goosby at a Press Conference at the United Nations Office in Geneva, December 11, 2009 In 1991, Goosby began his government career as director of HIV Services at the Health Resources and Services Administration, in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In this position, he administered the newly- authorized Ryan White CARE Act, overseeing the distribution of federal funds and the planning of services in 25 AIDS epicenters, as well as in all 50 states and U.S. territories. In 1994, Goosby became director of the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy in the United States Department of Health and Human Services, where he advised on the federal HIV/AIDS budget and worked with Congress on all AIDS-related issues. In 1995, Goosby created and convened the DHHS Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infections. This panel defined how to use protease inhibitors in conjunction with already existing antiretrovirals, later expanding its work to address standards of care for antiretroviral use for pediatric patients and pregnant women. Goosby has remained actively involved in this panel, now known the DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, which is widely recognized as defining the standard of care for HIV/AIDS treatment in the United States. In 1997, Goosby also served as interim director of the Office of National AIDS Policy at the White House, reporting directly to the President as his senior advisor on HIV-related issues. Goosby's office was responsible for guiding the implementation of this initiative at HHS over the next three years. Goosby's office also coordinated scientific reviews of needle exchange as a public health intervention.

During this time, Goosby developed extensive international experience in the development of treatment guidelines for use of antiretroviral therapies, clinical mentoring and training of health professionals, and the design and implementation of local models of care for HIV/AIDS, focusing his expertise on the scale-up of sustainable HIV/AIDS treatment capacity, including the delivery of HIV antiretroviral drugs, within existing healthcare systems. On January 20, 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Goosby as his new Special Envoy on Tuberculosis. In this capacity, Goosby will work towards boosting the profile of the fight against TB and promoting the adoption, financing and implementation of the World Health Organization‚Äôs global End TB Strategy after 2015.

In 1990, the film was made into a feature-length made- for-TV movie titled The China Lake Murders, which is considered to be a remake of this film rather than an actual sequel. Plot summary Donnelly is a disturbed cop on vacation leave. Despite being off-duty, he is still in his uniform. As he rides through the desert on his Harley, he stops a lady whom he accuses of being drunk; while exhausted from driving continuously for hours, she is obviously anything but drunk. Donnelly proceeds to lock her in the trunk of her car, leaving her on a quiet road where no one is likely to pass by for some time. Continuing on, he stops at a closed petrol station in the middle of the night. The pumps are padlocked, so he takes out his revolver and shoots the lock off so he can refill his bike with fuel. The next day, Donnelly goes to China Lake for some relaxation and then goes to a nearby diner for lunch and coffee, which he refers to as Black Mud. Two cement workers are sitting at the main counter and they arouse his ire to the point that he completely forgets the (somewhat pleasant) conversation he was having with the waitress. Later that same day, he notices a car on the side of the road belonging to one of the truckers, as it has the same trademark on it. After the other trucker leaves his friend to repair the car by himself, Donnelly, who has been watching and waiting nearby for the men to return, makes a reappearance and chases the confused man before knocking him down. He then locks the man in the trunk of his car and pushes the car over the stretch of desert next to the road. Donnelly is next shown returning to work. When the watch commander asks Donnelly how his vacation was, he responds that he enjoyed it. The film comes to an end as the credits roll.

The report recommended that the federal government no longer be allowed to spend money in these 22 areas. Because of Quebec's new proposed responsibilities, taxing powers would need to be adjusted so that the federal government collect less and the Quebec government collect more, according to the report. As a result of its proposed changes, few areas would remain the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, including defence, tariffs, post,Weaver et al., The Collapse of Canada? (1992) p.82 currency, equalization payments and the federal debt.Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Breaking Point: Timeline - 1991 The report also made other recommendations on constitutional changes, including abolition of the Senate of Canada. The Liberal Party convention amended this proposal to call for reform of the Senate instead. The convention also approved some constitutional positions not included in the report, such as support for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, guaranteeing anglophone rights and recognizing aboriginals as \\"distinct nations\\".Richard Fidler, Canada adieu? Quebec debates its future (1991), p.50  Political significance  The Allaire report was adopted by the Liberal Party after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, a proposal to make much more modest changes to the Canadian constitution. The Meech Lake Accord would have amended the constitution of Canada to recognize Quebec as a \\"distinct society\\".Radio Canada, Canada: la saga constitutionnelle - L'Accord du Lac Meech (13 August 1999) When the Meech Lake Accord was not ratified by the legislatures of Manitoba and Newfoundland, Quebec, sovereigntists portrayed it as a rejection of French-speaking Quebec by the rest of Canada, which was English-speaking.Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Breaking Point: Timeline - 1991 Support for sovereignty increased significantly in Quebec in the months after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. The adoption of the Allaire Report as official policy by the governing Liberals was seen as the party's response to the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. It signalled a much tougher and more nationalist negotiating position for future constitutional amendment talks, which Liberal leader and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa felt was needed to take momentum away from the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, the pro-sovereignty opposition party. The French title of the report, \\"Un Qu√©bec libre de ses choix,\\" was evocative of \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre\\", a rallying slogan of supporters of Quebec independence from Canada. The next round of constitutional amendment talks with Bourassa, the other Canadian premiers, federal Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and aboriginal leaders in 1992 resulted in the Charlottetown Accord proposals.\\"The Charlottetown Accord\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia The Charlottetown Accord did not propose any transfers of power from the federal government to the provincial governments (although it did confirm that certain powers already exercised by the provinces would be recognized as their exclusive powers). The Liberal Party then held a convention which approved the Charlottetown Accord, over the objections of Jean Allaire and the Liberal Party Youth Commission president, Mario Dumont.McCord Museum, A Peek at the Political Future of Mario Dumont(M998.51.183) Both Allaire and Dumont quit the Liberal Party over this issue and subsequently formed a new political party, Action Democratique du Quebec.

It is the junction of the Framingham Secondary and the former Millis Branch. The station was open from November 1861 until April 1967. History=Medfield Junction station= 1911 diagram of Medfield Junction On November 18, 1861, the Charles River Railroad (part of the New York and Boston Railroad) was extended from Needham Center to Medway via Medfield; a station at Medfield opened then or shortly after. In 1867, the Mansfield and Framingham Railroad opened on a perpendicular route, crossing the Charles River line at Medfield Junction and opening its own station closer to the center of Mansfield. By 1898, both lines through Medfield Junction were owned by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Patients traveling to Medfield State Hospital were transported from the station in horse-drawn wagons. A freight wreck at the junction on October 23, caused by an engineer proceeding through an open derail, killed two railroad employees and injured four more. =Closure= Passenger service between Mansfield and Framingham ended in 1933, and Medfield Junction (often referred to thereafter as simply Medfield) was once again the sole railroad station for the town. Passenger service on the Charles River line was cut back from Woonsocket to Bellingham Junction in 1930, and discontinued entirely south of Needham Junction on July 18, 1938. Service south of Needham Junction was restored in March 1940, but cut back in stages to West Medway later in 1940 and 1941 (after which the line was known as the \\"West Medway Branch\\"), and reduced to a single daily one-car round trip (which was combined with a longer Needham Heights train at Needham Junction) in 1955. The newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) started subsidising continued NYNH&H; passenger service on the portion of the moribund West Medway branch running from Boston to Millis on April 24, 1966; service on the truncated Millis Branch was discontinued on April 21, 1967 due to extremely poor ridership. The remaining stations, including Medfield, closed at that time; all except Dover and Millis were later demolished. =Current use= The Framingham Secondary passed through Conrail, CSX, and finally into state hands in 2015; CSX runs regular freight service on the line through Medfield Junction. The Bay Colony Railroad took over freight service on the former Millis Branch east of the junction from Conrail in 1982, and west of the junction in 1987. , the only Bay Colony service through the Junction is occasional gravel trains towards Millis.

ISSN 1368-485XPurdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 343. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. Production of the aircraft ended in 2005 when the manufacturer went out of business. The rights to the design were purchased by its original designer, the aircraft updated with an updated aluminum fuel tank and put back into production in 2013 by U-Fly-It Light Sport Aircraft, LLC of DeLand, Florida.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 86. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Development The aircraft was designed to meet the requirements of FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles, including maximum empty weight. The builder-achieved empty weights vary from to , with being typical. To remain under the FAR 103 empty weight requires the use of a light-weight engine, such as the 2si 460-F35 or the Hirth F-33. Design Oshkosh 2001 The Aerolite 103 features a high wing with half-span flaps that are extended by use of an overhead bellcrank to a maximum of 40 degrees. The flight controls are three-axis and are actuated by a wheel mounted on a control column via flexible push-pull cables and conventional rudder pedals connected to the rudder by cables. The engine throttle is a twist-grip type and incorporates a brake lever to operate the non-differential mechanical drum brakes installed on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear. The aircraft has conventional nose wheel steering connected to the rudder pedals. The main landing gear utilizes sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads. There is a fourth small caster- wheel under the tail, because when the pilot's seat is unoccupied the aircraft rests on its tail, due to the aircraft's empty center of gravity. The Aerolite 103 is sold as an assembly kit aircraft. The kit includes an illustrated assembly manual and pre-built fuselage, wings, control surfaces, jury struts and struts. The wings are covered by the builder with pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. The company estimates the time to complete the airframe at 60‚Äì80 hours. The kit does not include powerplant, propeller or instruments. When the aircraft was first introduced the standard engine was the 2si 460-F35, with the Rotax 447 optional. In 2009 the standard recommended engine was the Rotax 447, with the Rotax 503 single carburettor engine optional. Aerobatics and spins are prohibited. Operational history Since its introduction the Aerolite 103 has won many awards, including: *AirVenture 1997 - Grand Champion Ultralight *Sun 'n Fun 1998 - Best Commercial Design *AirVenture 1998 - Reserve Grand Champion Ultralight *Sun 'n Fun 1999 - Grand Champion Ultralight *AirVenture 1999 - Grand Champion Ultralight In December 2004 the company reported that 150 aircraft were flying, the majority as unregistered US ultralights. In July 2009 there were 12 Aerolite 103s registered as experimental amateur-builts in the USA.
