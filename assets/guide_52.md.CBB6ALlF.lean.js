It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 14 resources, including three contributing buildings, seven contributing structures, one contributing site, two noncontributing buildings, and one noncontributing structure. with The oldest structure in the district is the city-owned water tower that was completed in 1922 on what was the city reservoir. Two Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects were added in the 1930s. The first WPA project was a concrete swimming pool and brick bathhouse that were completed in 1938. The main pool and the wading pool were owned by the city and used until 1988 when a new facility opened in another location. The local public school district took ownership at that time and filled the pools in and built a concession stand over the wading pool in 1990. The bathhouse and the former mothers' pavilion, where mothers could watch their children swim, remain in place. The football stadium is the second WPA project. It was dedicated in 1939 and completed the following year. The stadium is located in the drained reservoir. It is composed of a grass playing field with a cinder track, two gateway structures with castellated stone towers that double as ticket booths, a stone storage building, sections of a stone retaining wall, and two sets of bleachers. The concession stand and press box were built in 1990, and are not considered historical. The same is true for the retaining wall at the north end of the field, which replaced the original stone wall in the mid-1960s.

Socio-emotional Adaptation Theory figure 1 The emotional reactions associated with Alzheimer's disease tend to present as cognitive or behavioral symptoms, leading to interventions that do not treat the underlying emotional trigger. Socioemotional adaptation theory outlines four contextual domains that interact to result in emotional states which manifest independent of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, emotions of depression/sadness, apathy, concern/fear, anger/frustration, and acceptance are entwined within a set of complex binary (positive/negative) interactions including: relationship with the formal support (i.e., patient vs. disengaged), relationship with the support partner (i.e., teamwork vs. infantilization), coping (i.e., adaptive vs. non-adaptive), and perceived control (i.e., internal vs. external locus-of-control). Understanding the factors which may contribute to emotional changes in persons with Alzheimer's disease may help patients, informal support partners, and formal caregivers identify and address the root cause of these emotional changes.

Sankey During the last three decades of the 19th century, Ira D. Sankey partnered Dwight Moody in a series of religious revivalist campaigns, mainly in North America and Europe. Moody preached, Sankey sang; as part of his musical ministry, Sankey collected hymns and songs, and in 1873 published in England the original edition of Sacred Songs and Solos, a short collection of 24 pages containing some of the favourite hymns that Sankey had introduced during the first Moody and Sankey evangelistic tour of Britain, in 1873‚Äì1875. Over the following years new, expanded editions of Sacred Songs were produced, containing many standard hymns as well as revivalist songs, the final edition from the 1900s containing 1,200 pieces. Sankey wrote the words for very few of these, but he composed and/or arranged new tunes for many of the hymns in the collection, particular for those written by Fanny Crosby. The following lists contains all the hymns composed by Sankey that are found in the \\"1200\\" edition of Sacred Songs and Solos.

She was also an internationally recognized expert on oil spills.\\"Spooner, Molly (1914‚Äì1997).\\" Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages. Significant research Mare's study of marine food cycle in sea mud led her to introduce the new term meiobenthos to join the terminology of macrobenthos and microbenthos. This has to allow improved understanding of marine organisms involved in these cycles through clearer reference to groupings by size. The importance of this approach is shown by the continuous reference to her work by other marine biologists into the 21st century. Following the grounding of the oil tanker Torrey Canyon on the west of the Scilly Isles, Mare returned to her life as a researcher after taking a break during the 1950s. She studied the effects of the oil spill and contributed to the book on the disastrous oil spill called Torrey Canyon Pollution and Marine Life (1970). A tool called a dispersant was used to try to clean up this oil spill and Mare was one of the first people to recognize that these could be causing more damage than the oil spill itself. This research led her to be known as an oil spill expert to the rest of the world.  Early career and life  Mare won a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge where she began her studies of marine biology. In 1936 she took part in the Easter class of the Marine Biological Association (MBA). Mare received a Bathurst Research Studentship in 1938, following her graduation from Newnham. In 1939 she received a Maitland Balfour Research Studentship. These Studentships allowed her to spend two years at the MBA in Plymouth where she primarily started her career.  Personal life  Molly F. Mare married Malcolm Spooner, a zoologist at the Marine Biological Association Laboratory on 14 May 1943. Until 1945 she lived away from her husband while she conducted research on antifouling of ships at the Millport Marine Laboratory located near Glasgow. They had two children, including Heather. In 1948 the family of four moved to Crapstone. Her husband, Malcolm Spooner, worked on a long-term study of dwarf oak trees in Wistman's Wood and she helped him significantly with this work. They also undertook recording work for the Atlas of the Devon Flora (1984).  Awards and recognition  In 1973 Mare was appointed the Department of the Environment's advisor on oil pollution precautions and procedures. After she retired from active research in 1976, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1977 for her work on the effect of oil pollution on marine life. She was a founding member of the Devon Wildlife Trust and was its vice president in 1987. Her bequest to the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom was to encourage undergraduate students to experience marine biological research every year.

It orbits outside of the habitable zone of its star at a distance of 1.9 AU. The exoplanet was found by using the radial velocity method, from radial-velocity measurements via observation of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the planet's parent star. The planet has a mildly eccentric orbit.  Characteristics  Mass, radius and temperature HD 240237 b is a \\"super-Jupiter\\", an exoplanet that has a radius and mass larger than that of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. It has a temperature of , around that of the surface temperature of Venus.http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_HD_240237_b.png It has an estimated mass of around 5.3 and a potential radius of around 9% larger than Jupiter (1.11 , or 12.2 ) based on its mass, since it is more massive than the jovian planet. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) giant star named HD 240237. It has exhausted the hydrogen supply in its core and is currently fusing helium. The star has a mass of 1.69 and a radius of around 32 . It has a surface temperature of 4361K and is likely 2 billion years old based on its mass and evolution. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 8.19. Therefore, HD 240237 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.  Orbit  HD 240237 b orbits its star with nearly 331 times the Sun's luminosity (331 ) every 746 days at a distance of 1.9 AU (compared to Mars' orbital distance from the Sun, which is 1.52 AU). It has a mildly eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.4.  Discovery  The planet was detected through Doppler spectroscopy, the method of observing exoplanets through the measurement of radial velocities of a star. If there is a wobble, it could mean that there is a possible planetary companion orbiting it. Observations were taken with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope equipped with the High-Resolution Spectrograph in a queue-scheduled mode. From July 2004 to October 2009, 40 epochs were measured, with SNR values ranging from 161‚Äì450. These observations eventually led the team to conclude that there was in fact a planetary companion orbiting around HD 240237, and they estimated its parameters to be a mass of 5.3 times that of Jupiter, an orbital period of 746 days, an eccentricity of 0.4, and a semi- major axis of 1.9 AU. The discovery, along with 2 other exoplanets, were announced on October 9, 2011.

It had a launch weight of , a power production capacity of 9 to 9.9 kW at end of life and a 15-year design life. Its payload is composed of 26 C band and 18 Ku band transponders with a total bandwidth of 2,853 MHz. SKY Perfect JSAT Group will use JCSAT-2B as a replacement for JCSAT-2A to provide communications services to Japan, Asia, Russia, Oceania, and the Pacific Islands. History On June 11, 2013, SSL announced that it had been awarded a contract by SKY Perfect JSAT Group to manufacture JCSAT-14. It would be a 10 kW satellite with 26 C band and 18 Ku band transponders with a 15 years of expected life. It was scheduled for launch in 2015. On January 10, 2014, JSAT announced that it had signed a launch service contract with SpaceX for the launch of JCSAT-14 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. The expected launch date was the second half of 2015. But the failure of Falcon 9 Flight 19 meant a delay of at least six months on the launch. On March 14, 2016 SSL delivered JCSAT-14 to the launch site, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, for launch processing and integration. JCSAT-14 was launched on May 6, 2016 at 05:21 UTC by a Falcon 9 rocket. The next day, SSL announced that the satellite had deployed the solar arrays, was in full control and was performing orbital maneuvers to reach its operational position. Since July 2016, the rechristened JCSAT-2B is commissioned and operational at the 154¬∞ East orbital slot.  Launch and rocket landing  JCSAT-14 was launched to geostationary transfer orbit on May 6, 2016 at 05:21 UTC, as the 24th mission of a Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket. The rocket's first stage subsequently landed on the autonomous spaceport drone ship Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean. The first stage of the rocket encountered \\"extreme temperatures during its reentry into Earth atmosphere\\" and was subsequently identified as a candidate for reflight, and as a \\"reference vehicle\\" for further testing. It was subjected to a series of tests, including a 150-second full-duration engine firing completed on 28 July 2016. Additional tests were planned before SpaceX determines the stage's suitability for reuse on a subsequent launch. SpaceX has since completed at least 7 more full-duration firings of the core, and has indicated that this stage will be used solely for ground testing purposes.

Despite a late challenge by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump won the primary and netted all 58 delegates in the winner- take-all contest. On the same day were held Democratic and Green primaries in Arizona, as well as Republican and Democratic caucuses in Utah and Idaho Democratic caucus, so the day was dubbed \\"Western Tuesday\\" by media. Voter suppression controversy Fountain Hills on March 19, 2016. Senator Ted Cruz at a campaign rally at Arizona Christian University in Phoenix on March 18, 2016. There was controversy surrounding the Arizona primary elections of 2016, specifically having to do with the decrease in polling places in Maricopa County from 200 in 2012 to only 60 in 2016, despite the number of registered voters having increased from 300,000 in 2012 to 800,000 in 2016. This decrease in polling places was most pronounced in minority neighborhoods, most notably Latino neighborhoods, with areas like Central Phoenix having only one polling place for 108,000 voters. There were also reports of voters who had been previously registered coming up as unregistered or registered as an independent, making them ineligible to vote in the closed primary. Voters who did manage to vote had to stand in long lines to cast their ballots, some for as long as five hours. Additionally, voters reported being required to vote with a provisional ballot. In 2005, Arizona threw out 27,878 provisional ballots, counting only about 72.5% of the total provisional ballots reported. Taking into account the effects of the Supreme Court's \\"gutting of the Voting Rights Act\\", it's unknown what percentage of the provisional ballots were counted in 2016. This was the first election in the state of Arizona since the 2013 Supreme Court decision to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which would have previously required states with a history of voter discrimination, including Arizona, to receive Federal approval before implementing any changes to voting laws and practices. Within a day after the election took place on March 22, a petition went viral on the White House petitions site asking the Department of Justice to investigate voter suppression and election fraud in Arizona. The petition reached 100,000 signatures in 40 hours, and as of June 5, 2016, nearly 220,000 people have signed the petition. The White House responded on May 20, 2016. In addition, Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the allegations of voter suppression. The Department of Justice has since launched a federal investigation into the primary. Results Analysis Donald Trump won Arizona decisively, netting all 58 delegates and carrying all counties in the state but two. As The New York Times described, \\"Mr. Trump proved his appeal among immigration hard-liners, who make up a large bloc of Republicans in the border state.\\" Trump won the populous cities of Phoenix in Maricopa County, and Tucson in Pima County. He enjoyed support from former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, both of whom hold a hard-line stance against immigration. As Eric Bradner of CNN described, \\"Their decision to side with Trump, and the size of his win, underscores the potency of Trump's build-a-wall plan with the Republican base.\\" See also * 2016 Arizona Democratic primary References Republican Arizona Arizona Republican primaries Electoral fraud in the United States Voter suppression March 2016 events in the United States ","title":"2016 Arizona Republican presidential primary"},{"id":"51199627","text":"Robert A.

The dating of her birth at 1754 and her death at 1794 are conjectural.Orlando project Retrieved 29 July 2016. Life and work De Fleury is thought to have been a schoolteacher before moving to 2 City Mews, White Cross Street, Islington, and then to nearby 31 Jewin Street, Cripplegate, in the City of London. However, there are signs in her writings that she felt defensive about her lack of formal education. Her earliest dated poem is an Epithalamium, written to mark her brother's wedding on 25 November 1773.Wayne C. Ripley in The Encyclopedia of Romantic Literature, ed. Frederick Burwick (London: Blackwell Reference, 2012).

As a member of the strongly anti-Catholic Protestant Association, De Fleury actively defended Lord George Gordon, who had instigated it and was accused by Charles Wesley and others of inciting the riots over the restoration of civil rights to Catholics. Her pamphlet vindicating Gordon, entitled Unrighteous Abuse Detected and Chastised, appeared in 1781, as did her Poems, Occasioned by the Confinement and Acquittal of the Right Honourable Lord George Gordon, President of the Protestant Association. The pamphlet \\"depicts her enemies baying against Truth like village curs at the moon.\\"The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 276. Despite being a Baptist, Fleury belonged to the Independent Meeting House of John Towers, originally a breakaway from a Presbyterian congregation. The meeting house was moved from Bartholomew Close to new premises in Jewin Street in 1784. Fleury was also on close terms with the Baptist minister and religious writer John Ryland. She went on to dedicate to Gordon a masque-like work in blank verse entitled Henry, or the Trump of Grace (1782), in which Henry's guardian angels, Religion and Grace, stave off the attacks of Syren. This went into three editions. God and liberty Many of De Fleury's hymns ‚Äì some still sung todayHymnary site Retrieved 29 July 2016. ‚Äì appeared first in her volume Hymns for Believers' Baptism (1786). Her Divine Poems and Essays were collected and published in 1791. Included was a work in couplets entitled \\"British Liberty Established and Gallic Liberty Restored, or The Triumph of Freedom\\", where she compares herself to Deborah celebrating Jael and honours such figures and events in history as Alfred, Magna Carta, Oliver Cromwell, King George III and the French Revolution. It emphasizes the Amazonian role played by women in the course of history and presages Christ's reign on Earth. De Fleury, encouraged by John Ryland, became involved again as a controversialist in a \\"pamphlet war\\" with the preacher William Huntington and his ostensible Antinomianism. Her Letter of November 1787 elicited from him abuse from the pulpit, and from his daughter a 1788 pamphlet entitled Mother Abbess denying the place of women in the area of public debate. Her Answer (1788) stressed that women's liberty of speech was God-given. Her Antinomianism Unmasked and Refuted (1791) again drew a printed retort from Huntington (The Broken Cistern) and another series of responses, De Fleury's Falsehood Examined on the Bar of Truth and Huntingdon's An Answer to Fools. After 1791 De Fleury disappears from history, although The Missionary Magazine published an otherwise unattested poem credited to her in 1802.

Cox (1920-2005) was a Comanche activist who worked on legislation for Native American children. She received many accolades for her efforts including the 1974 Indian Leadership Award from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and state recognition that same year as the Outstanding Citizen of Oklahoma from Governor David Hall. She was named as an Outstanding Indian Woman of 1977 by the North American Indian Women's Association, and served on the National Advisory Council on Indian Education from 1983 to 1990. In 1993, she was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame for her work with foster children and the founding of the North American Indian Women‚Äôs Association. Early life Marie Cerday was born on January 17, 1920 at the Lawton, Oklahoma Indian Hospital to Herlinda (n√©e Portillo) and Dave Cerday. She attended the Ft. Sill Indian Boarding School and later went to Walters High School. Cerday went on to further her education, studying at Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma. On June 6, 1938, in Lawton, Cerday married James M. Cox. James was the grandson of Chief Quanah Parker and later served as chair of the Comanche Nation. Years of activism In 1970, Cox founded the North American Indian Women's Association (NAIWA) and served as its first national president. She identified the goals of the organization as improvement of home and community, healthcare and education, and intertribal communication, as well as cultural preservation and fellowship. It was one of the first national organizations of Native American women and sought intertribal solutions for women's issues. In 1971, the organization held its first conference in Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, followed a few months later by one in Albuquerque, New Mexico establishing education as its focus for the coming year. Cox served as national president of the organization through 1973. In the early 1970s, Cox began touring Native American communities throughout the United States collecting data on the needs of Indian children. She specifically focused on institutionalized children, who were part of the Foster Care System, in group homes, or those living in American Indian boarding schools. The study, conducted by the NAIWA and funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), was made for the U.S. Congress. In 1972, Cox served on the Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Department‚Äôs National Action for Foster Children Committee, which evaluated the care given to children under the program. She signed the Bill of Rights for Foster Children, drafted in 1973, which was ratified by Congress and attended the White House Conference on Mental Retardation. In 1974, she received the Indian Leadership Award from the BIA for her work as chair of the National Action for Foster Children Committee, drafting the Foster Children's Bill of Rights, and her direction of studies on how the BIA handled native children's care. That same year, she was recognized by Oklahoma Governor David Hall as the Outstanding Citizen of Oklahoma. In 1975, Cox was a speaker in Window Rock, Arizona at the Southwest Indian Women's Conference. More than 800 native women attended the conference, which looked at both political and cultural mechanisms that fostered discrimination against Native American women, but their goals were to empower women within their traditional tribal identity. In 1977, at a banquet hosted at the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School by the NAIWA, Cox was honored as the \\"Outstanding Indian Woman of 1977\\" for her work in establishing the NAIWA and with children's needs. That same year, she attended the NAIWA conference which was investigating the sterilization of Native American women by the Indian Health Service. Other issues examined included the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which had long been a focus for Cox. In 1983, Cox was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to succeed Nadine Chase on the National Advisory Council on Indian Education. She was reappointed in 1985, 1987, and 1989, serving until she was replaced in 1990 by Terry Neese. In 1984, Cox was appointed to the board of the Child Welfare League of America and in 1988 she served as a member for the Oklahoma Indian Affairs Commission. In 1993, Cox was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame and in 1999 she and James were interviewed as part of the Museum of the Great Plains Oral History Project.

She completed her doctoral research in 1901 but did not complete writing her dissertation. However, her work was published under the guidance of her supervisor, Edward B. Titchener. She was recognized with membership in Sigma XI from Cornell and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. Research Bagley's research in the field of Psychology occurred during her time at the University of Nebraska and Cornell University. However, her professional positions were all unofficial. Bagley's research interests were the aesthetics of color. She investigated the optical illusion of colors appearing to the viewer when a disc with black and white sectors is spun (Prevost-Fechner-Benham Subjective Colors). She conducted a systematic analysis of the response, first described by Fechner. Her work defined that a low rate of rotation was required for this subjective effect.

His decision to pursue boxing as a career was not met with approval by his father. He fought a number of exhibitions around London prior to his completing his University education which caused a further rift from his strict father, and likely interfered with his completing his University studies.\\"The Roped Arena, A Clergyman's Son\\", The Shippenburg News, Shippenburg, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 23 September 1898 He started his better publicized professional boxing career around the age of twenty-one by winning three short preliminary fights at the National Sporting Club in Convent Garden London on 28 January 1895 against Jack Gray, Sid Phillips, and Jim Whelan.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Dixon did the leading but unlike many of those who had previously met the little Colored fighter, Jordan went at him and mixed it all the time.\\" The bout was close, and many believed a draw would have been a better decision. Jordan was down on his hands and knees in the seventh from a blow by Dixon, but the bout contained relatively few knockdowns and no counts. The bout ended with a flurry by Dixon, but the referee did not feel it adequate to award him the decision.

In 814 Ishaq was appointed to the Yemen by al-Ma'mun, and he arrived in the province that summer. He remained in the Yemen until the following year, when he learned that nearby Mecca had been occupied by the Alid rebel Hasan ibn Husayn ibn al- Aftas. Ishaq responded by organizing an expedition to recover the city for the caliph and began marching for the Hijaz, but he suffered an attack by Bedouin en route and was forced to retreat back to Sana'a. A short time later, he learned that another Alid, Ibrahim ibn Musa al-Kazim, was advancing toward the Yemen to take control of the country, and decided not to offer any resistance to the rebels. He therefore departed, together with all of his cavalry and infantry, along the Najd Road, effectively surrendering the province to Ibrahim.; ; ; . Following his departure from the Yemen, Ibrahim headed in the direction of Mecca, where Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq had been proclaimed as anti-caliph, and eventually reached Mushash, where he encamped. There he was joined by his mother and several Abbasid loyalists who managed to escape from the city, and he proceeded to engage the rebels in battle for several days. After failing to defeat the Alid forces, he decided to withdraw and make his way toward Iraq, but along the way he was met by reinforcements led by Warqa' ibn Jamil and convinced to turn back around. The combined forces met the rebels at Bi'r Maymun near Mecca and scored a victory, putting the rebels to flight after two days of combat.

M. Bongaarts (born 1945) is a Dutch-American demographer. He serves as Vice-President and Distinguished Scholar at the Population Council, where he has worked since the 1970s. Bongaart has performed research in a diverse set of topics, such as population growth and aging, mortality, population- environment links and demography related to the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. His most recognized work lies in the field of fertility, and has been a topic of interest throughout his career. Career Bongaarts was born in Tegelen, the Netherlands, in 1945. He obtained a degree in electrical engineering from Eindhoven University of Technology in 1968. Bongaarts subsequently moved to the United States where he studied physiology and biomedical engineering at the University of Illinois and obtained his PhD in 1972, with a dissertation titled: \\"A Cybernetic Model of the Demographic Transition\\". He subsequently was a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University. He started working as associate for the Center for Population Studies of the Population Council in 1973. By 1982 he had become senior associate. In 1988 he became deputy director. The next year he was promoted to vice president of the policy research division. Since 2007 he also serves as distinguished scholar. Research Bongaarts has performed research a broad variety of topics, such as: population ageing, fertility, population policy options, life expectancy. During the 1980s and 1990s he did research on the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Research of Bongaart on worldwide and smaller scale birth patterns has taken into account his statistical research on malnutrition, the availability and access to birth control and abortion, malnutrition and the duration of breastfeeding. In 1994 Bongaarts published the article \\"Population Policy Options in the Developing World\\" in Science. The article examined three causes of population growth: unwanted fertility, high desired family size, and population momentum. The article subsequently provided policy. It is considered to be one of the most influential articles in demography. Bongaarts has designed an influential model on the fertility rate of a society, consisting of four main points: the proportion of married women, the proportion of women unable to bear children, the proportion of women using anticonceptives, and the abortion rate. In an article in Nature in February 2016, Bongaarts showed projections of world population growth by 2100 and argued for worldwide spread of quality contraception and family planning within ten years to slow down population growth. He furthermore argued for commitment to family planning at national and international level. He has seen the possibility of the latter increase since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. Honors and distinctions He was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. He was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2002. In 2013 he was selected as International Union for the Scientific Study of Population laureate. In his nomination letter for the laureate Samuel H. Preston wrote: \\"I can think of no one who has contributed more to the battery of methods used to study population processes.\\".

Early life Kessler, the second son of German immigrants Leonard Kessler and Mary Ritchouer Kessler, began Philadelphia apprenticeships in wholesale dry goods, malting, brewing, and tobacco merchandising in 1772 before joining the American Revolution Military at age 16 in 1776.Life of John Kessler an 1823 autobiography by John Kessler.

Privateer seaman on the brig Delaware Young Kessler's initial service as an entry level privateer sailor proved to be the fortunate beginning of a long term relationship, signing the muster rolls of the brig Delaware. Her captain, the Irish-born John Barry, had begun his sailing life at age 9 by signing on to his uncle's private ship as a cabin boy. He learned fast, and at age 21 was selected to be captain of a small Philadelphia merchantman.John Barry ‚Äì An American Hero in the Age of Sail written by Tim McGrath published in 2010 by Westholme Publishing, LLC, 904 Edgewood Road Yardley, Pennsylvania 19067 Barry grew to identify with America as his country, and Philadelphia as his home. By the time the American Revolution began Barry was a seasoned mariner and received a captain's commission in the Continental Navy from the President of Congress, John Hancock, in March, 1776. On April 7, 1776 Captain Barry's brigantine, the Lexington, engaged and captured the British sloop Edward. It was the Continental Navy's first combat victory. During the war Barry became so successful against both Royal Naval vessels and Loyalist privateers that Admiral Richard Howe offered him a handsome sum and captain's commission in George III's navy. In 1779, Barry was without a command in the Continental Navy; Congress permitted him to accept the captaincy of the privateer brig Delaware. John Kessler began his maritime career under Barry's watchful eye. In Barry, the teenage Kessler acquired his best possible mentor; in Kessler, Barry found a loyal, smart understudy who became a trusted associate and friend for life.Give Me A Fast Ship ‚Äì The Continental Navy and America‚Äôs Revolution at Sea written by Tim McGrath published in 2014 by the Penguin Group (USA) LLC, 375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014 He promoted Kessler from landsman to steward, clerk, and later Captain of Marines. The Delaware‚Äôs cruise to Port au Prince, Haiti, resulted in the capture of two prize eligible vessels. When the Delaware returned to Philadelphia, Barry returned to service in the Continental Navy, while Kessler remained with the privateer, whose command was transferred to Lieutenant James Collins. A subsequent voyage to St. Eustatia and Port au Prince returned to Philadelphia without incident. On their next voyage to Port au Prince, the Delaware and her crew were captured by three British frigates, HMS Phoenix, Pomona, and Lowstoff.Loss of the Phoenix written by John Kessler is on file at the Pennsylvania State Archives, 350 North Street, Harrisburg, PA 17120-0090 Lieutenant Collins, Kessler, and their fellow sailors were greeted by their captor, Sir Hyde Parker, with: ‚ÄùMy Lads, you will now consider yourselves as belonging to his Britannic Majesty‚Äôs Ship Phoenix, and if you behave yourselves well you will be treated the same as the rest of the crew. But had I my will, I would hang every one of you for fighting against your King and Country.‚Äù John Kessler was assigned to the Pomona. He was treated well, but was soon incarcerated by the British in Kingston, Jamaica on July 15, 1780. Sir Hyde Parker's flagship, Phoenix, encountered very harsh weather, and soon ran aground, damaged beyond repair. Collins, Kessler, and about 15 crewmembers were assisted by Lieutenant Collins‚Äô brother, who worked in Jamaica and helped them escape their Kingston captors in a small vessel. They sailed to Port au Prince, and arrived there on September 27, 1780. Once ashore, they decided to seek passage to America separately. Kessler took passage on a 20 gun ship whose destination was Salem, Massachusetts. Midshipman and master mate on the Frigate Alliance A penniless, raggedly-clothed John Kessler arrived in Salem, Massachusetts on November 11, 1780. Having had no friend or contact in Salem, he learned that Captain Barry was captain of the 36 gun frigate Alliance docked in Boston. In spite of Kessler's shabby appearance, Barry recognized him immediately and gave him a hearty welcome. Desperately short of hands, Barry was as glad to see Kessler as he was glad to see Barry. Kessler accepted the position of acting midshipman aboard the Alliance. Thus began his service in the Continental Navy. For the next two years, their service together on the Alliance included engaging and capturing enemy ships of war on the high seas; safely transporting war leaders such as Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Paine, and Colonel Laurens from America to France; overpowering a mutiny; and transporting desperately needed currency to America.Rough Sketch of Life of Commodore Barry written by John Kessler at the request of Mrs. Barry for a publication known as Port Folio. It is on file at the Pennsylvania State Archives, 350 North Street, Harrisburg, PA 17120-0090 Barry's courage, integrity, leadership, and sailing knowledge insured his, Midshipman Kessler's, and the Alliance‚Äôs survival under combat and severe weather. Kessler's duties expanded to ship's log keeper, allowing him to enter accounts of major naval combat activities. One of the most famous engagements occurred on May 29, 1781 when the Alliance was engaged by two British ships - the Atalanta and Trepassey. Initially the Alliance was adrift by calm winds. The two British ships used their sweeps to maneuver themselves into advantageous positions off the Alliance‚Äôs stern. For three hours, their combined broadsides swept the deck and quarterdeck of the frigate, tearing into the rigging while inflicting numerous casualties. Kessler was wounded in the leg, and Barry was seriously wounded in the shoulder. Barry's loss of blood required his removal from the main deck but when his Lieutenant, Hoystead Hacker, suggested surrender, an enraged Barry emphatically declared that surrender would not be considered, and he demanded to be brought back to the Alliance‚Äôs deck if Hacker had truly lost his will to keep fighting. The emboldened Lieutenant Hacker resumed command and followed Barry's orders not to surrender. Soon the wind returned, allowing Alliance to sail and take control of the fight. In minutes, her broadsides changed the momentum of the battle. One British captain was killed; soon the surviving British captain Sampson Edwards, surrendered both ships. Kessler brought Edwards aboard the Alliance to Barry's cabin. When Edwards offered Barry his sword, he refused, simply saying ‚ÄúI return it to you, Sir ‚Äì you have merited it and your King ought to give you a better ship ‚Äì here is my cabin at your service, use it as if your own.‚Äù Throughout the war, Barry's treatment of prisoners was exemplary, and could be considered a paradigm for the standard of behavior accepted by today's United States military under similar circumstances. The Alliance continued cruising the Atlantic, its campaign, capturing a host of prizes. By war's end, Barry had promoted Kessler to Master's Mate. The Treaty of Paris signaled the end of the American Revolution. Barry had captured the first enemy ship of the American Revolution and, on March 10, 1783, fought the last sea battle of the American Revolution. The Alliance‚Äôs arrival in Providence on March 25, 1783 signaled the end of Kessler's service in America's Continental Navy. Early chronicler of American navy history Captain Barry was arguably the most brilliant and courageous sailing ship master of his time. He accumulated a superior knowledge of the sailing ship, its routes, and ports. He would develop techniques for the development of fast, maneuverable, sailing ships of war. His outside communications were direct, succinct, and effective, but not effusive. He had self-confidence and courage in his knowledge of the sailing ship and its environment, but was not self-promoting, or arrogant.

Barry and Kessler had become trusted friends during America's struggle for independence. They both resided in the Philadelphia area in the years following the American Revolutionary War and maintained their friendship. After Barry's death, their mutual friend John Brown teamed with Kessler to write early sketches of Barry's life for a magazine publication, Port Folio. Kessler's autobiographical sketch and his writings on Barry are on file at the Pennsylvania State Archives. Since 1903, they have been used as a foundational reference for early American naval history and four biographers of Captain John Barry.A Naval History of the American Revolution ‚Äì Chapters 16 and 17 Distinguished Philadelphia citizen John Kessler's post-war business and government career began in Boston. He married Abigail Anderson on October 6, 1783. Abigail gave birth to their first son, John, on July 11, 1784. He first moved his small family and fledgling business activities to Waldeborough, Maine. He moved to Philadelphia in May, 1793, and initially established himself as a shopkeeper. From their marriage until her death on December 3, 1793 Abigail gave birth to a total of six children. Five of them died shortly after birth. Only their first son survived to maturity. In May, 1795, Kessler married a widow, Martha Berrill Shriver. He gave up his shop keeping and applied his administrative and writing skills to assume valued administrative positions of responsibility in Philadelphia. In 1800 he was elected to the state legislature. this elevated the public's recognition of his administrative and financial talents that would offer many opportunities for future growth for the rest of his life.

Epilogue John Kessler's descendants visit Commodore John Barry's Statue at Wexford, Ireland. After the American Revolution ended with the Treaty of Paris, Captain Barry focused on securing back pay for his sailors. He also engaged in private shipping cruises to rebuild his own finances. In 1794, President Washington recognized that our emerging nation needed an organized Navy in addition to its Army. He offered six distinguished officers a commission in the new U. S. Navy as Captain with relative seniority rank. Barry became the U. S. Navy's first and highest ranking Captain. This appointment elevated him to the fledgling U. S. Navy's equivalent to today's Chief of Naval Operations. After accepting Washington's appointment, Captain Barry and shipbuilder Joshua Humphreys began building and staffing the first ships to comprise the U. S. Navy. Barry later assumed command of the large frigate, United States, and served with the honorary rank of ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù of the navy's first squadron. He faithfully served his country under Presidents Washington, Adams, and Jefferson as its senior Navy Officer until his death in 1803. Commodore Barry's fellow sailor, John Kessler, and longtime Irish friend John Brown eulogized their beloved Irish Catholic Commodore as ‚Äúthe first of patriots, and the best of men.‚Äù John Kessler's descendants believe that John Barry was Ireland and God's gift to America's quest for freedom from Great Britain. His knowledge, courage, morality, decency, and integrity will serve as a perpetual role model for all that serve in the armed forces of the United States of America. On behalf of the American People, President Dwight D. Eisenhower honored Commodore Barry's service to the United States with the donation of a statue of Commodore Barry to the people of Wexford, Ireland on September 14, 1956.Letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to Ireland President O‚ÄôKelly dated September 14, 1956 courtesy of the American Presidency Project As a US Navy PT boat commander in World War II, President (then Lieutenant, j.g.) John F. Kennedy was also wounded engaging his country's enemy - Japan. His blockade of Cuba, accompanied by his willingness to leave his opponents room to find a peaceful solution to the Cuba Missile Crisis, made sure that the event remained only a crisis. And, while his advisors debated strategy in the Oval Office, John Barry's cutlass ‚Äì the same one he used while serving with John Kessler, hung on the office wall.

Early life Nadia Ali (Urdu: ŸÜÿßÿØ€å€Å ÿπŸÑ€å‚Äé) is a first-generation American who is from Pakistan, and raised in New Jersey. She felt isolated by her family's conservatism although she did not wear a hijab. She was raised as a Muslim and in an interview on July 2016 with Refinery29, she stated that still identified herself as a practicing Muslim. She prays two to three times a day, and said \\"I kind of have an internal conflict sometimes. One of the biggest main sins it‚Äôs hard to be forgiven for is adultery ‚Äî having sex without marriage is a sin and doing it multiple times a day as an escort is one of the major sins that you will not be forgiven for, and I am fully aware of that, but yeah, I still pray.\\" Career Pornographic career In 2013, 21-year-old Ali was working as an eyebrow threader in San Francisco when a friend recommended that she accompany her as a stripper; she made $500 that night and worked as a dancer and escort in 2014. Ali was encouraged to wear a hijab in pornography due to sexual taboo and to increase her opportunities. One of her films, titled Women of the Middle East, involves a domestic violence scene followed by a sex scene, when the man becomes aroused. Its advertising blurb reads: \\"They may look suppressed, but given an opportunity to express themselves freely, their wild, untamable natural sexuality is released.\\" She blames culture, rather than religion, for patriarchy in Pakistan and has said she wanted to make solo and lesbian scenes to \\"show the world that Middle Eastern girls of Pakistani descent really do get horny.\\" She has said that she has been \\"banned\\" from Pakistan for performing in pornography in a hijab, and also has received online death-threats for performing. In 2016, she left the pornographic industry after making twenty scenes, when her mother discovered she was doing porn and became depressed. She also stated that she found the idea of her 21st film, of a man resembling Donald Trump having sex with a Muslim woman, to be degrading. Her bookings to perform in Florida after the 2016 Pulse Orlando shooting were canceled for fear of backlash. Other ventures Ali now works as a cosmetologist.

The Amazing Race host Phil Keoghan and his riding partner Ben Cornell completed the ride in 22 stages spread over 26 days to the original schedule in 2013. Keoghan's wife Louise Keoghan was the producer for the film, which premiered in Watson's home town Christchurch in July 2016. Background Keoghan was born in Lincoln, New Zealand and went to school in nearby Christchurch. Despite being a cycling-enthusiast, he had not heard of Christchurch cyclist Harry Watson who was the first New Zealander to compete in the Tour de France. In 2010, Keoghan learned about Watson by reading his biography, Harry Watson: The Mile Eater, authored by Jonathan Kennett, his partner Bronwen Wall, and cycling historian Ian Gray. \\"Blown away\\" by the inspiring biography, Keoghan decided that he would tell Watson's story. The three Australians (Hubert Opperman, Percy Osborn, and Ernest Bainbridge) and Watson had most of the necessary funds to go to Europe raised by newspapers (The Melbourne Herald, The Sporting Globe, and The Sun in New Zealand). The four were to be complemented in France by six Europeans to make a team of ten, but this failed to eventuate. Competing with such a small team against teams of ten put the Australasians at a significant disadvantage, and the general expectation voiced in the media was that they could consider themselves lucky if they would make it as far as the Pyrenees, i.e. manage to stay in the race for the first eight stages. Plot Keoghan is seeking advice from Jonathan and Simon Kennett about re-enacting Harry Watson's 1928 ride in the Tour de France on period bicycles. Jonathan Kennett's advice to Keoghan is: > I don't think that you know what you are letting yourself in for, and if you > did, you wouldn't do it. Keoghan proceeds regardless and talks Ben Cornell into being his riding partner. They procure racing bikes from the era, and Keoghan researches the original route and drives it. The day after the 2013 Tour de France arrives in Paris, Keoghan and Cornell set off; not as planned early in the morning but late in the afternoon after Cornell's bike was temporarily lost by an airline. Sticking to the original schedule for every stage, day 1 finished in the middle of the night; one of many night time finishes. Keoghan and Cornell's experiences are interlaced with historic footage, showing the drama of the day. The 1928 race was designed to eliminate as many riders as possible, and of the 164 riders who started (other sources show slightly different numbers), only 41 finished the race. Historic footage is narrated in newsreader style by veteran New Zealand newsreader Hewitt Humphrey. French media coverage is conveyed, where the general expectation was for the Australasian team to be eliminated quickly, as they would not be able to keep up with the 10-person teams of European riders. Keoghan and Cornell sometimes get joined by other riders. In the Pyrenees, a local cycle enthusiast and historian mapped out a detailed schedule which saw them start at midnight so that they would get to their destination before nightfall. The three set off together and by 8am, they had already covered , equating to half that day's distance. Keoghan wonders why they started so early, not realising that the harder part of the ride was still to come. In the end, Keoghan and Cornell could not keep up with their 65-year old host, who also rode a period bicycle, and they were slower than expected, finishing the day after 23 hours of riding. Keoghan and Cornell had difficulty navigating and on occasions, inadvertently ended up on A class roads where cycling is prohibited. Keoghan and Cornell arrived back in Paris after 26 days, as per their schedule, outside the Parc des Princes that in 1928 was a velodrome. They reflected that there are parts of the ride that they cannot remember due to physical and mental exhaustion. Against the odds, three of the four Australasian riders reached Paris, defying all dire predictions. Keoghan repeatedly reflects that despite his and Cornell's exhaustion, their 2013 ride was much easier than what Watson encountered, with unsealed roads and many punctures per day. Production Phil Keoghan and Ben Cornell are the main two riders during the 2013 re-enactment; Keoghan also narrates off the bike and directed the movie. Produced as a documentary, much historical footage is shown, both as still photos and movie clips. Keoghan found many of the still photos at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra where curators were unaware what exactly the collection of old photographic plates showed. Louise Keoghan, Phil Keoghan's wife, was the producer for the movie. Greg Peart was the photo-moto for the team and is often filmed himself. Phil Keoghan's parents John and Beth were support crew, with his father as driver. Scott Shelley was the cameraman, Uri Sharon was the second camera in French and Jess Bushyhead was the editor. Keoghan chose Christchurch for the world premiere to give prominence to a forgotten hero. The film first screened at the restored Isaac Theatre Royal on 29 July 2016 as part of the New Zealand International Film Festival; Keoghan walked past the building every day early in his career on his way to the Television New Zealand studio in Gloucester Street.

Plot Opening quote: \\"So the animals debated how they might drive the robbers out, and at last settled on an idea.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) is now experiencing side effects after drinking the antidote. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) takes some of Nick's blood and pours it on a sample that is ingested by Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) and Renard (Sasha Roiz). When she returns home, she has hallucinations of her house with endless staircase and an enormous pit in the living room. The next day, Monroe goes to a bank when suddenly, three Wesen rob the bank. Investigating the robbery, Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are told by Monroe that the Wesen broke an important law of honor of the Wesen: the Gesetzbuch Ehrenkodex, which forbids any Wesen from exposing their form to the public to \\"take advantage of normal folk\\". As Nick is a Grimm, he must deal with this. Monroe decides to find out in a Wesen bar about the robbers. The robbers begins to attack him until he is saved by Nick and Hank and Monroe manages to deduce they were the robbers. The next day, the robbers pull a heist on another bank but they kill a woman and a police officer during their escape. This continues to cause some concerns in the Wesen community, who show up in the spice shop. While asking a homeless man in a factory, they discover one of the robbers is Gus Campbell (Eric Martin Reid). Renard discovers the two other robbers and sends an email to De Groot (Nurmi Husa), a member of the Wesen Council to handle the situation before the Wesen get known to the public. Gus tells the robbers Cole (Callard Harris) and Krysta (Lili Mirojnick) that he plans to leave them and is killed. They flee to the factory while Nick and Hank find Gus' body. Nick and Hank arrive to the factory and arrest Cole and Krysta, but they are certain that they won't be arrested because they have not any evidence. While Renard gives a press conference in the station, Nick and Hank bring Cole and Krysta. Suddenly, an assassin appears and shoots Cole and Krysta, killing them both. It turns out De Groot sent the assassin in response to the violation of the Wesen law. The episode ends as Juliette continues having hallucinations in her bed while receiving a call.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"The best thing about 'Natural Born Wesen' is that it echoes last season's 'Cat And Mouse' which similarly expanded the Wesen world in compelling fashion. But this episode isn't as good as that one, since it skimps on the explanations and necessary confrontations that arise from the information that Monroe and Rosalee reveal.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"One of Grimms greatest storytelling abilities is having the advantage of literally showing what is directly underneath the surface of its characters, using it to quickly give the audience a characterization; this technique has been used with Rosalee, but she's continually breaking out of her meek shell now. This might be due to Nick, like Monroe, but some of it is due to her taking up her family's business and finding her place in the Wesen world.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"At the spice shop, Juliette and Renard aren't sure what's going on regarding Nick, the cat that started this whole mess, and their attraction to one another. Monroe attempts to explain the 'emotional nuclear meltdown' that they just went through, but it doesn't seem to get through the either of them, partially because they were more focused on Nick waking up from the drink that he consumed at the end of last week's episode.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"While the first two episodes after Grimms long break were both enjoyable, the show needs to finally address the nuts and bolts of the world it's presented to us. We need to see what the Wesen get out of living with humans, or explain why living on their own in hidden all-Wesen communities doesn't work. We need to meet more Wesen who don't , and we need to see that humans in Portland break the law, too‚Äîotherwise we're dealing with a world where only Wesen are criminals, and if that's the case we're back to the question of why they're even attempting to fit in.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Natural Born Wesen"},{"id":"51200245","text":"Deadman Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Washington.

The work was commissioned by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and was completed in October 2001. Its world premiere was given by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Paavo J√§rvi at the Concertgebouw on April 16, 2004. Composition Background The symphony is cast in one continuous movement and has a duration of approximately 20 minutes. Sallinen described its composition in the score program notes, remarking, \\"I have sought to combine two contrasting elements in this work: one that is fragmentary and sketchy, and one that maintains a symphonic discipline and coherence.\\" He continued: The music quotes the \\"Theme of the Dead\\" from Sallinen's 1992 opera Kullervo. Additionally, the \\"Bell Theme\\" of the symphony's finale is a homage to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; this theme consists of the possible musical notes contained in the words \\"Concertgebouw Amsterdam,\\" or CCEGEBAEDA. The composition of the symphony was influenced by the September 11 attacks, which occurred late in the writing process. Sallinen wrote, \\"The title Autumnal Fragments refers not only to the age of the composer, but also the tragic events of September 11. That is why the finale turned out to be different from my original design.\\" Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of four flutes (3rd and 4th doubling piccolo), three oboes, three clarinets (4th doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception The symphony has been praised by music critics.

The site is one of the longest-standing SSSIs in England, having been listed since 1954, and displays the interaction of a fluid magma rock, now known as the Whin Sill, interacting with older sedimentary rock. Coastal erosion at the site enables sections of the geological strata to be seen. In turn, the soil associated with the Whin Sill gives rise to a distinct pattern of vegetation which on its own merits is at this site found notable. Location and natural features The Bamburgh Coast and Hills SSSI is situated on the east coast of the far north-east of England, in the county of Northumberland, about north- east of the town of Bamburgh. The site is 'T'shaped, the bar of the T running for approximately along the north-west - south-east orientated beachfront north of Bamburgh, and the descender running inland for some following a south-east facing escarpment as high ground at circa above sea level falls to a new level at circa . Both the coast and the escarpment expose sections of strata of Whin Sill and underlying rock, making the site advantageous for studies of local geology. The strata at Bamburgh is complex, and appears to show areas of faults pre-existing the intrusion of the sill, where sedimentary rafts have dipped from the horizontal; intrusions by the whin sill; and faults occurring after the intrusion, delineated by carbonite-filled fractures, and the occurrence of barytes. Vegetation The Whin Sill is an igneous rock, Dolerite, which gives rise to a soil chemistry particular to the location, and thus to a distinct habitat for vegetation. Soil on the Whin Sill is thin and prone to drought in summer months. Plant species found at the site include the Perennial plant wild onion (Allium vineale), maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides), common rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium), meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis) and crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha). Annual plants including knotted clover (Trifolium striatum), forget-me-nots (Myosotis spp), dove's-foot cranesbill (Geranium molle), parsley-piert (Aphanes arvensis), heath groundsel (Senecio sylvaticus) and squirreltail fescue (Vulpia bromoides). More acidic areas provide habitat for sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) and bell heather (Erica cinerea). A number of plants characteristic of the coastal location are found, including thrift (Armeria maritima), buck's-horn plantain (Plantago coronopus), common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium) and sea plantain (Plantago maritima). Heath areas exhibit heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bell heather with meadow oat-grass, bitter vetch (Lathyrus montanus), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), hawkweeds (Hieracium spp), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and the uncommon mountain everlasting (Antennaria dioica). Areas fed by freshwater springs support common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris), marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), sea arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima) and the rare seaside centaury (Centaurium littorale). The condition of the geological units of Bamburgh Coast and Hills was judged to be favourable in 2009 & 2014, however the two vegetative units were judged to be unfavourable-declining and unfavourable-no change, condition reports citing encroaching gorse (Ulex spp) and competitive grasses, and a complete lack of planned management.

Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia (1940-1960) p. 527. Retrieved 13 October 2016 A lieutenant in the Byrd Organization, Fitzpatrick was active in the Massive Resistance to racial integration vowed by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. He introduced much of the segregationist legislation and was vice-chairman of the Boatwright Committee which investigated the NAACP for litigating on behalf of civil rights, before being defeated in the 1959 Democratic primary. Early and family life Fitzpatrick was born in Roanoke to Frank Abbath and Maggie Thomas Fitzpatrick. The family included two brothers, Horace S. Fitzpatrick (1913 - 1990) and Beverly Thomas Fitzpatrick (1919-2000), and a sister, Margaret Elizabeth Fitzpatrick Mayes (1906 - 1984). Beverly Fitzpatrick followed in his elder brother's footsteps at Jefferson High School and Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia and in becoming a lawyer, but served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and became a judge. Earl Fitzpatrick married Mary Linn Petty (1905-2002) and was active in the Presbyterian Church. Political career Fitzpatrick served as Roanoke's city attorney from until . In 1935, Roanoke's voters had elected Marion S. Battle and Raye O. Lawson to serve as their delegates in the Virginia General Assembly, but Lawson was not certified by the Committee on Privileges and elections in the extra session, so his seat remained vacant. In 1937 Fitzpatrick and Walter H. Scott won election to the Virginia General Assembly as the two delegates allotted Roanoke. Both were re-elected in 1939 and 1941; Walter W. Wood replaced Scott and served as Roanoke's delegate alongside Fitzpatrick in 1943 and 1945. In 1947, Fitzpatrick won election in the relatively new Virginia Senate District 36 (representing Roanoke City). He replaced independent Democrat Leonard G. Muse (what the Byrd Organization called an \\"Anti\\", meaning Anti-Byrd Organization). Beginning in January 1936, Muse had previously served over a decade, mostly alongside Byrd Democrat Harvey B. Apperson of Salem, Virginia (seat of Roanoke County) in the 21st District, which then had two seats and encompassed Radford as well as Franklin, Montgomery and Roanoke Counties. When District 36 was created in 1943 to cover the City of Roanoke, Muse had been elected to the seat, but Fitzpatrick denied him re-election four years later, and he was appointed to the Virginia School Board. Apperson failed to qualify in the contested 1943 senatorial election for District 21, but was his fellow delegates selected him to serve as a judge on the Virginia State Corporation Commission; in the special election that followed, Republican Ted Dalton of Radford was elected as District 21's senator, and re-elected several times. Roanoke City is now again in District 21, along with Giles County and parts of Roanoke and Montgomery Counties. In any event, upon his election, Fitzpatrick sat in the Virginia Senate next to the Byrd Organization's heir-apparent, Harry F. Byrd, Jr., who was also first elected there in 1948 and represented Winchester, Virginia together with its surrounding counties (and served there until his father retired from the U.S. Senate).http://www.ncsl.org/documents/lrl/PointsofPersonalPrivilege- VASenate2013.pdf Fitzpatrick was re-elected as Roanoke City's senator in 1951 and 1955, although in the latter election the Roanoke City senatorial district was renamed District 35. Massive Resistance and Roanoke As part of Massive Resistance, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Stanley Plan in September 1956, which included provisions for pupil placement boards, as well as to close any school that integrated, even pursuant to a court order. Dalton became a leading opponent of school closures, while Fitzpatrick followed the Byrd/Stanley strategy. Roanoke had always considered itself more progressive than, for example, Prince Edward County, whose schools were a companion case to Brown. Roanoke's school board already had an African American member, Dr. Lylburn Downing, and it had recently built Lucy Addison High School and several elementary schools for its African-American community. However, the quality of those facilities was worse than those for white children, with some schools overcrowded, some heated only by wood stoves and/or lacking indoor plumbing as well as cafeterias and auditoriums. In January 1956 over NAACP opposition, Virginia's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution which allowed tuition grants to private schools (which became known as segregation academies). In early 1956, the Roanoke NAACP local's new president, attorney Reuben Lawsen, sent the Roanoke School Board a letter demanding desegregation. The school board delayed, then in 1958 proposed to issue bonds to construct new schools and improve facilities, which required voter approval. The school bond market by then was terrible because the Stanley Plan implemented in the fall of 1956 included not only provisions closing any school that integrated, it also established an expensive system of vouchers supporting segregation academies for parents who did not wish their children to attend integrated schools.Peter Jones, Integrating the Star City of the South (thesis, College of William and Mary, at p. 6 et seq. Retrieved 13 October 2016 On February 18, 1958, the General Assembly passed (and Governor Almond signed) additional legislation protecting segregation, what the Byrd Organization called the \\"Little Rock Bill\\" (responding to President Eisenhower's use of federal powers to assist the court-ordered desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, allowing the governor to permanently shut down schools policed by federal authority or near such a school). As the legislation's sponsor, Fitzpatrick watched as Governor Almond signed it into law. Anti-NAACP laws and the Boatwright Committee In addition to the pupil placement, school closure and school voucher laws overtly supporting segregation, the Stanley Plan included seven laws expanding the common law legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, as well as the statutory violation of unauthorized practice of law. In early 1957, Virginia's legislative leaders appointed two committees to carry out those new laws and investigate the NAACP, which was pursuing the legal cases to desegregate Virginia schools. The President of the Virginia Senate appointed Fitzpatrick (who became Vice-Chairman of the new Committee on Offenses against the Administration of Justice) and E. Almer Ames Jr. of Onancock; the Speaker of the House of Delegates appointed John B. Boatwright to chair the committee, with William F. Stone and J. J. Williams Jr. as members. Shortly after the session began in January 1957, the Boatwright committee issued letters requesting information from the NAACP, as well as the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties and other segregationist organizations, and the next month began subpoenaing NAACP membership lists. These activities prompted litigation (NAACP motions to quash the subpoenas) in Richmond and several Virginia counties. In March 1957, the Boatwright Committee opined that various segregationist organizations did not commit the newly expanded legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, nor the unauthorized practice of law. The commission's first report, issued November 13, 1957, recommended enforcement of those new laws against specific NAACP lawyers, whom it named.Report of the Committee on offenses against the administration of Justice, pp. 19, 20 The subpoenas and other activities soon reduced NAACP membership in Virginia by half. Two years later (after Fitzpatrick's defeat in the Democratic primary and with Stone remaining on the committee after his elevation to the Senate) the commission issued another report, that complained that the Virginia State Bar was not punishing those lawyers but instead spending $5000 on a Jamestown commemoration and $6350 on a new continuing legal education program.Robert A. Pratt, The Color of Their Skin: Education and Race in Richmond Virginia 1954-89 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1992) at pp. 8-9James R. Sweeney, Race, Reason and Massive Resistance: the diary of David J. Mays (University of Georgia Press, 2008) p. 176Richmond Style Weekly, July 15, 2009 p. 14 Massive Resistance ends and 1959 primary defeat Meanwhile, on January 19, 1959, both a three-judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court declared the Stanley Plan unconstitutional. The NAACP's actions contesting the Boatwright Committee's investigation of its attorneys, as well as similar cases concerning the Thomson Committee (also established in the Stanley Plan and merged into the Boatwright Committee in 1959), also wound their way through the courts. In May 1959, the U.S. Supreme Court in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform & Racial Activities unanimously overturned the contempt conviction of a Quaker printer hauled before the Thomsen Committee. The following month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued Harrison v. NAACP, sending back the first of the NAACP cases, so that the Virginia Supreme Court could first interpret the new laws. In the July 14, 1959 Democratic primary, Roanoke City Democratic Committee Chairman, fellow lawyer and former Marine William B. Hopkins, defeated Fitzpatrick. By August, Roanoke's school board announced its withdrawal from the segregationist Virginia Education Association, and three African American students were assigned to white schools, although the pupil assignment board refused to assign several other African American children whose parents requested transfer to white schools. When Hopkins assumed the Senate seat in January 1960, he began fighting to repeal the poll tax. Hopkins won re-election numerous times, and later led a commission to reorganize and modernize Virginia's state government. In 1960, as Fitzpatrick returned to private practice, the NAACP filed Cynthia Greene v. School Board of Roanoke City, and soon Marsh v. County School Board of Roanoke County and another case involving Pulaski County schools, all of which wound their way through the federal courts as Roanoke's and the other school boards continued passive resistance strategies. Several Roanoke schools integrated peacefully in September 1960, although others did not. Judge Simon Sobeloff of the Fourth Circuit ordered Roanoke's schools to integrate.Green v. School Bd., 304 F.2d 118, 124 (4th Cir. 1962) Meanwhile, because the Virginia Supreme Court only struck down one of the six new ethics laws, the NAACP case went back to the U.S. Supreme Court, and was argued twice. In the interim, the Virginia Bar attempted to prosecute NAACP attorney Samuel W. Tucker, but a circuit judge in Emporia, Virginia (in southeast Virginia) threw out that case in 1962. In January 1963, the U. S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button (1963), by a 6 to 3 majority struck down the remainder of the Stanley Plan's revised legal ethics laws. Roanoke's schools finally integrated in 1964. Further public service From 1965 until 1973, as the Byrd Organization disintegrated, Fitzpatrick represented the Salem District on the Virginia Highway Department Board, replacing S. Sutton Flythe of Martinsville.VDOT, A History of Roads in Virginia, Centennial Edition (Richmond 2006) p. 118, available at http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/historyofrds.pdf Death and legacy Fitzpatrick died and was buried in Roanoke in 1984.

It features four sculptures, collectively known as the Gospodor monuments, created in 2002. The tallest, standing at more than 100 feet, commemorates Mother Teresa and features a gold painted wooden statue of Jesus. Next to this monument is one featuring Mother Teresa herself. Another honors victims of The Holocaust and features an eternal electric flame. The park also includes a 100-foot tall monument depicting Chief Seattle to commemorate Native Americans and other indigenous tribes. After their installation in 2002, the sculptures caused routine traffic jams due to drivers rubbernecking and slowing down. The monuments, along with their night lights, were highly controversial with local residents and Gospodor was prevented from erecting additional sculptures by the county government.

The tracks were originally recorded for what would have been Van Zandt's seventh album (with the working title of Seven Come Eleven), but was not released until twenty years later due to a dispute between producer Jack Clement and Poppy Records founder Kevin Eggers. The record has been described those who knew Van Zandt as a crucial \\"missing link\\" in his discography.  Recording  Van Zandt released two albums in 1972, including The Late Great Townes Van Zandt, which included two of his most covered songs, \\"If I Needed You\\" and \\"Pancho and Lefty\\". His momentum was derailed, however, when the release of his next album was held up. As Van Zandt's former manager John Lomax III explains in the 2004 biopic Be Here To Love Me, \\"That was the sort of the missing link in his career. If that had come out right on top of the Late Great, it would've really been a whole other thing but I think Kevin lost the deal so Jack Clement just held on to the tapes\\". In the same documentary Steve Earle confirms that the tapes \\"got put back into the tape pool because Kevin Eggers didn't pay for them\\". According to John Kruth's 2007 biography To Live's To Fly: The Ballad of the Late, Great Townes Van Zandt, Lomax claims the original rough-board mixes of what became The Nashville Sessions reveal a stripped-down rhythm section providing solid support without the excessive overproduction that was added as an afterthought. Speaking of \\"White Freightliner Blues\\" guitarist Mickey White recalls, \\"I remember disagreein' with the production on it. I know that Townes wanted me to play guitar on that song but when I got there, it was already fully produced. There weren't any open tracks left for me to play on\\". As Kruth observes, \\"If the objectionable production can somehow be overlooked, it's apparent that The Nashville Sessions was filled with great songs. But along with new gems like 'The Spider Song' and 'Buckskin Stallion Blues' were hackneyed versions of 'White Freight Liner Blues' and 'Loretta', which both appeared earlier, in more definitive versions, on Live at the Old Quarter\\". While the background singers, hoedown fiddles and banjo picking that augment several of the songs may have been jarring for some Van Zandt fans, the instrumentation does provide the collection with a brightness not found on the singer's previous albums. White claims that Chuck Cochran really produced and arranged the album, playing piano and conducting the \\"monastery\\"-type backing vocals on \\"The Spider Song\\". The album also features Bobby Thompson on guitar, Joe Allen on bass, and Kenny Malone on drums.  Composition  The album opener \\"At My Window\\" recalls Van Zandt's composition from the year before, \\"To Live Is to Fly,\\" with life-affirming lyrics like \\"Living is laughing, dying is nothing at all\\". The gentle \\"No Place to Fall\\" and the rousing \\"Loretta\\" paint two very different portraits of female perfection, the latter telling the story of a barroom girl who is perpetually twenty-two and \\"tells me lies I love to b'lieve\\". The title \\"Rex's Blues\\" alludes to Van Zandt's friend Rex Bell, with the singer commenting in his preamble to the song on Live at the Old Quarter: \\"This song's about this good friend of mine, uh, Rex Bell, who used to own half this place. It's called 'Rex's Blues.' If you cut cards with Rex and you get a three he'll get a two, y'know what I mean?\\" Bell later stated of the song, \\"I didn't like it for many years. But he really pegged me\\". The song explores the singer's long battle with depression, its subject matter contrasting with the understated, gently- plucked banjo and the singer's amiable vocal delivery. \\"Pueblo Waltz\\" also name-drops a couple Van Zandt's friends, Susanna and Guy Clark. \\"Two Girls\\", which includes the lines \\"I've got two girls, one's in Heaven, one's below\\", may have been inspired by Van Zandt's former girlfriend Leslie Jo Richards, who had been murdered the year before. The song paints a surreal landscape peopled with oddball characters like Jolly Jane and her dozen husbands who come and go, caught in the oblique routines of their lives with no rhyme or reason. Commenting on \\"White Freight Liner Blues\\", biographer John Kruth contends it is: > ...an obvious metaphor for the heroin barreling like a semi down the > Interstate of Van Zandt's veins, addresses the dangers that he and his pals > constantly faced for a brief moment of euphoria...The song brought together > two of Van Zandt's biggest inspirations ‚Äì a driving rockabilly rhythm with a > blues lyric reminiscent of \\"Trouble in Mind, a standard in Lightnin' > Hopkins' set...

It was one of a series of similar NKVD-based divisions formed at that time. It served in the heavy fighting around Smolensk in July, then later in the defensive operations around Kalinin. During the Soviet winter counteroffensive it was part of the forces of Kalinin Front that drove the German forces away from Toropets. In the initial phase of Operation Bagration the division was given special recognition for its role in the liberation of the Belorussian city of Bobruisk. The 250th had a distinguished career as a combat unit, ending its combat path in Berlin.  Formation  The 250th Rifle Division began forming within days of the start of the German invasion on June 26, 1941, at Vladimir, in the Moscow Military District,Walter S. Dunn, Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p 75 based on a cadre of 1,500 officers and men of the NKVD Internal Troops.These may have been from the 54th Nerchinskozavodsk Border Regiment, since this regiment was under the command of I.S. Gorbachyov at the start of the war: http://www.generals.dk/general/Gorbachev/Ivan_Sergevich/Soviet_Union.html The remaining soldiers and officers came from the reserves. The NKVD order stated that the division was to be ready for service by July 17; in fact it was ready ten days earlier. Its order of battle was as follows: * 918th Rifle Regiment * 922nd Rifle Regiment * 926th Rifle Regiment * 790th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed from June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Nafziger, 1996, p 45 * 308th Antitank Battalion * 527th Antiaircraft Battalion * 418th Sapper Battalion * 670th Signal Battalion * 329th Reconnaissance Company The division was first assigned to 30th Army in Western Front. On July 21, the army commander disbanded the 110th Tank Division and distributed its battalions to his rifle divisions; this battalion was supposed to consist of two companies, one of ten T-34s and one of ten BT of T-26 light tanks, plus a command tank.Sharp, p 45  Combat service  The 250th was almost immediately committed to heavy fighting north of Smolensk, in the course of which, on July 26, the divisional commander, Mjr. Gen. Ivan Gorbachyov, died of wounds sustained in combat south of Belyi.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, trans. and ed. David M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. 13-14 In the course of this fighting, by Aug. 1 the three rifle regiments were reduced to the following strengths: * 918th: 727 men * 922nd: 1,195 men * 926th: 526 men After about two weeks of combat, the division had lost about half its strength. As well, by Aug. 5 the tank battalion was down to eight T-34s, one T-26, two BT-7s and six BT-5s, when the division was transferred to 29th Army. By early October the 250th had lost all its armor, and was reduced to 500 men fighting at Olenino. It received 500 stragglers from the Soviet rear, but this did not make it a cohesive unit, and the army did not consider the division a combat- effective unit during the following months.Jack Radey & Charles C. Sharp, The Defense of Moscow 1941, Pen & Sword Military, Barnsley, UK, 2012, p 18 While retreating to the Kalinin area from Rzhev, the division became part of the newly formed Kalinin Front, under command of Col. Gen. Ivan Konev. In spite of its combat status, in the dire circumstances of the time, on October 15 the 250th was ordered to \\"stubbornly defend\\" its sector, alongside the 220th Rifle Division, while other forces of the front prepared a counterattack against the German armor beginning to move north of the city. On the 18th, Konev reported that both divisions were falling back under German pressure. On October 21, the two divisions were assigned to 22nd Army, \\"to prevent an enemy breakthrough to Torzhok\\". By October 23 the Germans were still advancing slowly, with much air and artillery support, against the \\"skeletal\\" remnants of the division, but it was still offering resistance, and in the end the German plan to advance from Kalinin was stymied.Radey & Sharp, pp 71-72, 114, 137, 156 The 250th spent the winter in Kalinin Front, and in April 1942 was reassigned to the newly-forming 53rd Army in Northwestern Front, where it remained in the vicinity of Demyansk until February 1943.Sharp, p 45 After a brief posting to 1st Shock Army in the same Front, in early March the 250th got new orders to re-deploy to the new 2nd Reserve Army, in the Yelets, Lepetsk and Lebedian regions, in anticipation of the German summer offensive.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p 356 In April, 2nd Reserve became the 63rd Army, assigned to Bryansk Front, and the division was also assigned to 35th Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the duration. In this Front (Belorussian Front after October 20) the 250th would take part in the difficult fighting through Bryansk and towards the Dniepr River until February 1944.Sharp, p 45 On February 18, 63rd Army was dissolved, and 35th Rifle Corps was reassigned to 3rd Army, where it would remain for the duration. At the outset of Operation Bagration, on June 23, 35th Rifle Corps, under command of Major General Viktor Zholudev, formed one of the two assault corps of 3rd Army, packed into less than ten kilometres of front opposite the northern half of the sector held by the German 134th Infantry Division. On the second day of the offensive, at 0400 hours, the assault force unleashed a massive 2-hour bombardment on the defenders in the Rogachev area, but by 0800 only the first line of German trenches had been taken, as bad weather had scrubbed the planned air support. As the weather cleared towards evening, further lines were taken, and the 9th Tank Corps prepared to exploit a breakthrough. Northwest of Bobruysk on June 26, the tankers cut the road to Mogilev behind the German XXXV Corps, with 35th and 41st Rifle Corps close behind and the 134th Infantry shattered and in flight. On the following day Bobruysk was surrounded, along with most of German 9th Army,Dunn, Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp 185, 189, 195, 197 and it fell to the 250th to help clear and liberate the city, for which the men and women of the division received the name of that city as an honorific. On Aug. 9, the 250th was also awarded the Order of Suvorov II Class.Sharp, p 45  Into Germany  Also, in August, the division, along with its army and corps, were transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front, where it would remain for the next six months, assisting in the liberation of the remainder of Belorussia and eastern Poland. It was still in this front at the outset of the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January 1945, but in February was reassigned to 3rd Belorussian Front, fighting in East Prussia. In April, 3rd Army was once again reassigned, this time to back to 1st Belorussian Front, in preparation for the assault on the German capital. When the shooting stopped, the division was in the enemy's lair of Berlin, and the final full title of its men and women was \\"250th Rifle, Bobruysk, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division\\"Sharp, p 45 (Russian: 250-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ë–æ–±—Ä—É–π—Å–∫–∞—è –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –°—É–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è).

He ruled in the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). Harsha married the Chahamana princess Kanchuka, which indicates a rise in his social status. Harsha's successor Yashovarman was their son. The inscriptions do not mention which particular branch of the Chahamanas did Kanchuka belong to. Harsha is believed to have maintained friendly relations with the Kalachuris. The Varanasi grant of the Kalachuri king Lakshmi-Karna states that he \\"granted freedom from fear\\" to Bhoja II, Vallabha-raja), and a king named Harsha. This Harsha has been identified with the Chandela king by some historians, although R. K. Dikshit identifies him with a Guhila prince of Chatsu. The inscription probably implies that Lakshmi-Karna assured these kings that he would not fight wars against them. The same grant also states that the Chandela princess Natta (or Nattakhyadevi) married the Kalachuri king Kokkala I. Natta was probably related to Harsha in some way. R. K. Dikshit theorizes that she was his sister or his paternal aunt. According to a fragmentary Khajuraho inscription, Harsha restored a king named Kshitipala-deva on the throne. This Kshitipala has been identified with the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Mahipala. Harsha probably helped Mahipala restore the Pratihara ruler after the Rashtrakuta king Indra III sacked the Pratihara capital Kannauj around 915 CE. Another theory is that Harsha helped Mahipala overthrow the latter's step- brother Bhoja II. Because of the fragmentary nature of the inscription, it is hard to draw any conclusions with certainty. Several inscriptions of Harsha's descendants eulogize him using conventional terms, praising him for good qualities such as bravery, generosity, modesty, and statesmanship. The Khajuraho epigraphs claim that he ruled the entire earth. He is the earliest known Chandela king to have been given the imperial titles Paramabhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara. These inscriptions also mention his military successes in vague terms, but do not specifically name any enemies. Although very little purely historical information is available about Harsha, the available evidence suggests that he was more influential than any of his predecessors, and paved the way for the rise of the Chandelas as a sovereign power.

Shanties and vegetable gardens can be seen near the building and the wall of the university compound is in the background. There are several reportedly haunted locations in the Philippines. Reports of such haunted locations are part of ghostlore, which is a form of folklore. The entries are alphabetized. Luzon Metro Manila Balete Drive Manila Film Center * Ateneo de Manila University: One of the most prestigious educational institutions of the country, ADMU is claimed by believers to be haunted. *JP Sioson General Hospital and Colleges inc: Is a hospital with college facilities located in Quezon City, students and faculties reportedly spotted paranormal activities across the hallway during classes. * Balete Drive: A major residential avenue in the eastern part of New Manila, Quezon City, Balete Drive is noted as the site of several apparitions of a white lady, who is considered by believers to be the ghost of a teenage girl who was raped and killed by a taxi driver in the 1950s. * De La Salle University: Due to its brutal Second World War-era history (including the massacre of numerous refugees who sought shelter inside the Chapel of the Most Blessed Sacrament), DLSU is reportedly haunted. * Fort Santiago: This is a historic fortress in Intramuros, Manila, and said by believers to be haunted by ghosts of soldiers and civilian victims killed during World War II. * Malaca√±ang Palace: The official residence and principal workplace of the President of the Philippines is considered by believers to be haunted by numerous ghosts such as former presidents, former presidential aides and attendants, those from pre-Hispanic and Spanish eras, as well as a black lady peering out towards the Pasig River from a window of the Mabini Hall late at night. Manila City Hall at night * Manila City Hall: Believing city hall employees claim of wandering specters after 6:00 p.m. at night. Paranormal activities investigated in the area confirmed poltergeist activities, residual hauntings from Japanese-era ghosts and a woman believed to have died in the premises during World War II. Most of the hauntings are concentrated in the clock tower of the city hall.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/hobbiesandactivities/672722/paranormal- expert-ed-caluag-investigates-manila-city-hall-s-strange-occurrences/story/ Believers also indicate its eerie casket-like shape when viewed from above (although some contend it resembles the shield of the Knights Templar). * Manila Film Center: A major component of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the facility was the site of a construction accident in 1981. When construction of the building was rushed for a film festival, the ceiling scaffolding collapsed, killing several workmen. Rather than halt construction to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of the dead workmen, First Lady Imelda Marcos, the main financier of the project, was believed to have ordered cement to be poured into the orchestra, entombing the fallen workmen, some of whom were even buried alive. Various ghostly activities have been reported, including mysterious sounds, voices and poltergeist activity. In the late 1990s, a group called the Spirit Questors began to make visits to the film center, in an attempt to contact and appease the souls of the workmen who were killed in the building. Some of these spirits claimed to have moved on, but a few allegedly remain. The facility, formerly abandoned due to its reputation, is now in use after restoration works. * Miriam College: Believing students claim of the ghost of a nun in the ladies' restroom at the 2nd floor of the Caritas Building. Ozone discoth√®que as it appeared in 2008. * Ozone Disco: A former discoth√®que in Quezon City that was the site of the worst fire in the Philippine history. The fire killed at least 162 people and injured at least 95. The discoth√®que building was demolished in 2015, and the site is now presently occupied by GoodAh!!!, a 24-hour diner, co-operated by Boy Abunda, and paranormal activities in the area were claimed to have greatly minimized ever since. * PNB Branch Pasay: The fifth floor of this Pasay branch of PNB at Roxas Boulevard was used as a morgue for the 16-to-25 victims of a fire at the Regent of Manila hotel on February 13, 1985. Exorcisms were conducted on the said floor at the requests of previous occupants because of frequent paranormal activities. * Polytechnic University of the Philippines: The institution's Claro M. Recto Hall houses a theater where the backstage rooms are the hot spots of an apparition of a burnt entity as confirmed by theater director and professor Segundo \\"Dodie\\" Dizon. The College of Engineering is also a paranormal hotspot where not only a ghost of a child and a white lady are said to appear but also the spirit of a deceased professor frequents the halls. ABS-CBN telemagazine program Magandang Gabi, Bayan featured the paranormal case of PUP in its 2005 Halloween Special. * Robinsons Galleria: Most female shoppers avoided its department store in the 1980s because of rumors about a half-human, half-snake creature residing in the basement of the mall. It has since been debunked due to its absurdity, to the point that the mall itself referenced and humorously lampooned the claim in one of its ads. * Starmall Alabang: It is situated on the former site of the Alabang Cemetery. Believers claim ghosts haunting its theaters. UP Diliman Palma Hall * University of the Philippines Diliman Campus: Its long history is said to be the reason of its alleged hauntings. Some of the areas of reported paranormal activity include the College of Music, the Vanguard Building, and Palma Hall. Guerrero Theater, which is housed in the second floor of Palma Hall, supposedly hosts the spirit of a young theater actress who committed suicide after a newcomer obscured her recognition. * University of Santo Tomas: Is reported by believers to be haunted, due to its long history that spans from the Spanish era. Santo Tomas also served as an internment camp during the Second World War wherein many of the prisoners of war were \\"enemy aliens\\", mostly Americans, living in the Philippines. Many prisoners died of starvation, illness, and others. The university is also a witness to unlucky students resorting to suicide, such as the female ghost in one of the ladies' restrooms in the Main Building. Former UST Rector Magnificus Rolando de la Rosa confirmed in an interview about an alleged mass grave located near the UST museum. Bataan * Ruins of Lazareto de Mariveles: located at the heart of Mariveles, it was the first quarantine station that was bombed during the Japanese occupation. Benguet =Baguio= Baguio, the largest city of Northern Luzon and a noted tourist destination, is said to be highly haunted. There are several haunted locations scattered throughout the city, such as cemeteries, old hotels, and other sites where structures used to stand until the 1990 Luzon earthquake destroyed them, injuring and killing the people inside. The city was also the site of some of the most brutal atrocities committed during World War II. Such haunted locations include the following: * Casa Vallejo: The oldest hotel in the city, it was built in 1909 to house key personnel of the Bureau of Public Works, before becoming a hotel in 1923. It is alleged that it served as a detention center for the German prisoners of war in 1917. * Dominican Hill Retreat House: Commonly called Diplomat Hotel, it was originally a seminary and later converted into a hotel. Situated atop the Dominican Hill, it has been considered as the city's most haunted location as it was the site of numerous atrocities committed by the Japanese forces during World War II. * Hyatt Terraces Hotel: Was a 12-storey hotel that was destroyed in the 1990 Luzon earthquake. The destruction killed at least 50 people.

Only discovered in 1881 it is known for remarkable prehistoric parietal engravings - petroglyphic representations of wild animals (horses, ibexes, cervidae, bovines and mammoths), \\"which rank among the most ancient examples of art made by prehistoric\\" humans, dating back to between 30.000 and 25.000 BP, the Aurignacian cultural period of the Upper Paleolithic. The third decorated cave ever to be discovered after Altamira in Spain and the Chabot cave in Ard√®che it was the first cave ever to be classified and listed as a historical monument in France on December, 20th 1901. Excavations under the leadership of archaeologist Fran√ßois Daleau (1845 ‚Äì 1927) began immediately in March 1881 lasting until 1913. Lines on the walls were discovered in 1883 and the first animal engravings came to light in 1896 as the \\"...authenticity was never questioned, and it became one of the major arguments for the recognition of prehistoric art.\\" Discovery The discovery on March 6, 1881 was entirely coincidental, the local terrain never provided any clues for the existence of a cavern. A cow's leg got stuck in a small cavity while grazing on top of the cave. A local farmer discovered the cave as he tried to set the cow free, noticing the hole that had revealed the \\"Chamber of Engravings\\" of the Pair- non-Pair grotto. The cave documented map drawing Pair-non-Pair's moderately sized interior (length ) can be divided into three sections, which have been named \\"Galerie Nord\\" - Northern Gallery, \\"Salle de Gravures\\" - the Chamber of Engravings and \\"Corridor effondre\\" - Collapsed Corridor. The original entrance to the cave had already collapsed between 35.000 and 29.000 years ago during the late Ch√¢telperronian period. Still the cave was accessible during the Aurignacian and the Gravettian period via several secondary entrances which also disappeared over time due to sedimentation as the whole grotto was gradually and completely covered by debris and filled with sediment deposits. Fran√ßois Daleau accessed the grotto via a chimney from the top and steadily worked downwards through the layers of deposits, where an entrance eventually was brought to light. He applied progressive excavation techniques for the archaeological layers and recorded all the artifacts he found. Apart from the petroglyphs, wall paintings, 15000 stone tool fragments and around 6000 animal bones of 60 species were unearthed and recorded. Sediments deposited during the Aurignacian completely covered the wall engravings, the fact suggests these works of art must have been produced by occupants living before the Gravettian. Prehistoric occupation Human occupation took place over a period spanning 60,000 years from the Mousterian (~80 000 BP), the Chatelperronian (~40 000 BP), the Aurignacian (~30 000 BP) and into the Gravettian (~25 000 BP) cultures. Andr√© Cheynier and Henri Breuil conclusively determined four settlement periods in 1963 by analyzing the stratification of the sediments and the precise location of the many stone artifacts and animal bones. Contextual fossils and the nature of the tools found lead to the conclusion that the earliest two settlement periods must be attributed to Homo neanderthalensis, who is gradually less present at the site during the Chatelperronian and fully disappears during the Aurignacian. After the entrance to the cave had collapsed during the Ch√¢telperronian access was gained during the Aurignacian by axial cavities that opened to the left of the Chamber of Engravings. The occupation period is shorter and housing concentrated more in the Northern Gallery deep in the cave. During the Gravettian, housing was reserved for the bottom of the cave (Northern Gallery) only while the walls of the room were decorated with engravings of animal representations (horses, goats, the rare Megaloceros deer and mammoths). The cave was abandoned during the Protomagdal√©nien - around 22000 to 20000 years ago - when accumulation of debris and deposits had made access to and housing in the cave impracticable. Engravings mammouth engraving The choice of animals represented at Pair-non-Pair has not yet been explained completely. Notably small animals and birds are absent, while carnivores are represented only marginally by a few bears and a wild cat. Although carvings of the ibex are the most frequent no skeletal remains of this species were ever found, neither in Pair-non-Pair nor at any other prehistoric site in Gironde. Most animals carved on the walls of the cave are represented in pairs. Thus, there are two mammoths, two aurochs face to face and two horses side by side. One of these horses was nicknamed Agnus Dei by eminent cave art expert Henri Breuil, who came to the site for the first time in 1898 and interpreted and dated the engravings. The horse is represented with its head turned backward to its rump, giving it an impression of movement. The room engravings include one of the very rare representations of a Megaloceros giganteus, the largest deer that ever existed in Eurasia with antlers spanning to up to 3.50 meters in length. In addition to the wall art, balls of ochre and shoulder blades of cattle that had been used as pallets were found. Carved and cut bones, stone and bone beads and even a flute made of vulture bone came to light, all lending credence to the idea, that the occupants of Pair-non-Pair had a desire to deal with symbolism and aesthetics in a number of ways. Visits The only decorated cave open to the public in the Gironde region can be visited all year round. The cave is small and in an obvious conservation effort the number of visitors is limited to 18 people per group, and prior reservation is required. Prehistoric objects and artefacts discovered at the Pair-non-Pair Caves are on display in a special museum section. A new reception building was built in 2008, designed by architect Patrick Hernandez.

Elements of Turkish conservatism are also reflected in most parties situated on the political right, including the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). In Turkey, it is often referred to as T√ºrk tipi muhafazak√¢rlƒ±k (Turkish-style conservatism). Ahmed Kemaleddin, early follower of Turkish conservatism. Turkish conservatism is distinct from conservatism in other countries in that it is predominately at odds with the established state structure, tending to be critical of the founding principles of the Turkish Republic whereas most forms of conservatism elsewhere tend to endorse the principle values of the state. Ideals predominately at odds with conservatives, such as secularism, statism, populism and the existence of a social state are enshrined within the Constitution of Turkey. Turkish conservatism is rivalled mainly by Kemalism, based on the ideology of Turkey's founding President Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who brought about several social reforms influenced by a progressive pro-western agenda following the collapse of the deeply conservative Ottoman Empire. However, Kemalism has also been described as a form of conservative nationalism as it endorses and safeguards the established traditions of the Turkish state. Ahmed Esad Pasha, conservative politician during the Tanzimat era. Conservatism in Turkey tends to be inspired and strongly influenced by political Islam, with conservative values arising from local orders, Islamic tarikats and village traditions. Turkish conservatism therefore tends to be more socially conservative, religious and in favour of strong centralised leadership, therefore often being characterised as authoritarian by critics. Turkish conservatives also tend to show greater approval to the return of Ottoman culture as opposed to the western-inspired culture and values originating from the Republic era. Recent surveys continuously show that conservatism in Turkey enjoys strong political support, predominantly in the central Anatolia region and rural areas where village and local traditions remain strictly enforced. In 2012, only 8.6% of Turks described themselves as 'entirely non-conservative' as opposed to 12.6% in 2006. Research by Kadir Has University showed that 39.2% of Turks described themselves as conservative in 2013, falling to 20.7% describing themselves as conservatives in 2015.

It is a shrub with narrow leaves and groups of small, scented, pink or pale yellow flowers, growing near Esperance and in the Cape Arid National Park. Description Verticordia vicinella is a shrub with a single main branch and which usually grows to a height of and up to wide. The leaves are linear in shape, long with a rounded end. The flowers are scented and arranged in rounded groups on the ends of the branches, each flower on a spreading stalk less than long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, smooth and hairy. The sepals are about long, erect, pink, cream or pale yellow with 3 or 4 feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, about long, egg-shaped and hairy on the outside with a slightly ragged tip. The style is long, straight and hairy near the tip. Flowering time is usually from January to May, but has been recorded in most months. This species is similar to Verticordia minutiflora but the flowers are usually pink, where those of V.minutiflora are mostly grey to mauve. Verticordia vicinella also has staminodes between its stamens. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia vicinella was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from a specimen collected near Esperance and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (vicinella) is derived from the Latin word vicinus meaning \\"near\\" with the diminutive suffix -ella referring to the small flowers and similarity to V. minutiflora. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Micrantha along with V. minutiflora and V. fastigiata.

Early life John Baird was born on February 11, 1859 in Quebec City, Province of Canada, (now part of Quebec). His parents later moved to Seaforth, Ontario and stayed there until John's father died in 1874, and his mother took him and his siblings and moved to Zilwaukee, Michigan. After he became a U.S. citizen, John developed his interest in politics, and ran and was elected Zilwaukee Township Supervisor about 1890. State Politician In 1894, John Baird ran and was elected State Representative to the Michigan Legislature, and later elected State Senator. In 1906, Michigan voters approved calling a convention to write a new constitution for Michigan, and John Baird was elected a delegate in 1907. The new constitution that Johnny had a part in making was approved by the voters in November 1908 and took effect Jan, 1, 1909. In 1921, Michigan's series of different conservation departments were consolidated into the Michigan Conservation Department, and Governor Alex Groesbeck appointed John Baird to be the first head of it, serving in that position until 1927. Extraordinary Political Maneuvers In 1912, when the Republican state nominating convention was to meet in Bay City to nominate a candidate for President, John Baird knew in advance there would be trouble between the delegates who wanted to nominate incumbent President William H. Taft and those who wanted Theodore Roosevelt. While communicating with an official over the phone about an issue, a switchboard operator left a phone line open, and Baird overheard a conversation between two men who were discussing the convention, and John Baird's prediction proved true when the convention turned into a brawl between Taft and Roosevelt delegates. In 1924, during the Michigan Presidential Primary, John Baird had the name of a Hiram Johnson from Milwaukee placed on the ballot, which matched the name of Democratic Senator Hiram Johnson of California. John Baird, who believed presidential primaries were a waste of time and money, was trying to show how vulnerable the primary was to tampering, and the Hiram Johnson he put on the ballot turn out to have died months earlier. Quote from Baird One day, John Baird was pulling weeds from his garden, and his young grandson asked him what he was doing. He replied, \\"I'm pulling out the Democrats.\\" His grandson said he thought they looked like weeds, in which John Baird said, \\"What's the difference? They both choke out anything that's good.\\" References The Saginaw (Mich.)

It also houses a museum at its base. History The Quezon Memorial Committee which was tasked to organize a nationwide fund-raising campaign for the building of a monument dedicated to former President Manuel Quezon was established by virtue of Executive Order No. 79 signed by then- President Sergio Osme√±a on December 17, 1945. Then-President Elpidio Quirino proposed the relocation of the monument away from its original planned site but such plans were not pushed through. The Bureau of Public Works commenced the construction of the monument in 1952. The monument was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Historical Institute through Presidential Decree No.1 issued by then President Ferdinand Marcos on September 24, 1972. On January 14, 1974, the monument was formally designated as a national shrine and was inaugurated on August 19, 1978. The remains of former President Manuel Quezon was transferred to the Quezon Memorial Shrine from the Manila North Cemetery on August 1, 1979. The remains of his wife Aurora Aragon Quezon, was likewise transferred to the shrine on April 28, 2005. Architecture and design The Quezon Memorial Shrine was designed by Federico Ilustre. The monument is composed of three connected pylons and is located at the center of the Quezon Memorial Circle, a major park in Quezon City. An observation deck is also present at the top of the structure which has a capacity of 60 people which can provide a panoramic view of the city. A spiral staircase connects the deck to the bottom of the structure. The observation deck is currently not open to the public. The columns are adorned with three grieving bowed angels holding sampaguita (Jasminum sambac) wreaths with each of them representing the three major island groups of the Philippines namely, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Each of the angels were given a traditional clothing representing one of the three island group. The angel figures were made by Italian sculptor Francesco Riccardo Monti. Under the watch of former Quezon City Mayor Tomas Morato, the monument was beautified by Amberti, an Italian architect hired by Morato, with Carrara marble. Morato's successors replaced the Italian marbles with locally sourced marble. Museum At the base of the Quezon Memorial Shrine is the Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon (), a museum that has a collection of relics and memorabilia related to former President Manuel Quezon, as well as a mausoleum which houses the interred remains of Quezon and his wife Aurora Aragon Quezon. The museum underwent a renovation by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and was reopened on August 19, 2015. Among the other features of the museum is a hologram of Quezon delivering his inaugural speech as President and interactive booths and terminals which edifies visitors regarding the Commonwealth era. The museum also has an audio-visual room where a short documentary on Quezon and the museum is screened, a dedicated gallery to Quezon's wife, Aurora, and a replica of Manuel Quezon's Presidential office.

Difenbacchia, 2003 (front) Isabel Iacona (born Buenos Aires, 1955) is an Argentine artist known for her detailed paintings of enlarged flowers and pop portraits of people and pets. She uses several mediums: oil on canvas, mixed techniques, watercolors and drawings. Her works have been commissioned in Europe and the Americas and she has lived in several countries.  Childhood and education  As a child, Iacona learnt drawing with the Argentine Informalist artist Enrique Barilari, who was a friend of her father's. Her father's work for a shipping company meant the family moved a lot. She was later mentored by Leopoldo Presas, a member of the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes de Argentina (National Academy of Fine Arts) and President of Sociedad Argentina de Artistas Pl√°sticos. She also studied with Julio G√ºero, Maria Luisa Manasero, and Ana Eckell, who represented Argentina at 1997 Venice Biennale. She completed her school education at Northlands School and got her college degree at the Santa Ana School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires in 1980. Later Iacona attended the Sorbonne in Paris.  Career  During the 80s, Iacona moved to Punta del Este, Uruguay where she worked as a professional landscape designer planning and designing gardens and parks. This later became the basis of her floral art. She would work during the day, and paint at night. Her flowers are a synthesis of what she sees, rather than photorealistic renditions of her subjects. In the late 80s Iacona moved back to Argentina where she started showing her paintings in Buenos Aires galleries. She also participated in the Centro de Arte y Comunicaci√≥n (CAYC) Biennal organized by art critic Jorge Glusberg. In 1990, the Argentine Museo Nacional de Arte Decorativo selected one of her works, Sunset Flowers, as a state present to China. It became one of the first works by an Argentinian artist in the Hangzhou Art Center's collection. In 1992 she moved to Kinsale, Ireland to participate in a collective exhibition which lead to a year of work there. In 1993, she moved to Paris to work on her flower artworks and commissioned portraits. Her work then took her to America where she first lived in Austin, Texas where she worked on a site-specific work for a Catholic chapel. After Austin, she spent two years in New Orleans, before moving to New York in 1996 where she continued to work till 1999. In 1998, one of her works was selected to participate in the Sal√≥n Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas at Palais de Glace, Buenos Aires. That year, the exhibition was held in the city of Paran√°, Entre R√≠os. With the nomination for Sal√≥n Nacional, she traveled to Argentina and decided to stay and reconnect with her Argentine roots and fellow artists. She studied aesthetics with professor and researcher Lucas Salvador Fragasso. \\"El debate est√©tico contempor√°neo\\" (Contemporary Aesthetics Debate) evolved around concepts such as aesthetic experience, artistic autonomy, artwork analysis based on philosophic texts from Adorno, Benjamin, Heidegger and others such as Hal Foster, Georges Didi-Huberman and Rosalind Krauss. In 2000 she gave birth to her daughter. During that period, she started painting flowers on larger canvases and many of her works focused on pop portraits of children, commissioned by friends and others. By 2014, requests for commissioned works from Europe had accumulated and she and her daughter moved to London, returning to Argentina in 2016.

After the idea developed further, Larsen got in touch with Nils Krantz in Bergen, and the idea then became a reality.√òdeg√•rd, √Öse. 1992. Aage Storstein. En billedbygger i norsk kunst.

Set in 1982 during the Lebanese Civil War, the film stars Jon Hamm as a former U.S. diplomat who returns to service in Beirut in order to save a colleague from the group responsible for the death of his family. Rosamund Pike, Dean Norris, Shea Whigham, Larry Pine and Mark Pellegrino also star. Principal photography began in Morocco in June 2016. The film premiered on January 22, 2018, at the Sundance Film Festival and was released in the United States on April 11, 2018. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who called it \\"absorbing despite its flaws\\" and praised Hamm's and Pike's performances. Plot In 1972, Mason Skiles is a U.S. diplomat in Lebanon living in Beirut with his Lebanese wife, Nadia. They have recently begun caring for Karim, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who claims he is without a family. While hosting a party, Skiles is confronted by his friend, CIA officer Cal Riley, who wishes to question Karim, whose brother Rafid Abu Rajal has been linked to the 1972 Munich massacre. The party is attacked by Karim's brother, Rafid, who abducts Karim; in the ensuing gunfight, Nadia is killed. Ten years later, Skiles has become an alcoholic and is working as a self- employed labor arbitrator in New England. While arbitrating a labor issue between particularly intransigent parties and struggling to keep his small firm afloat, he is approached by Sully, an old client, on behalf of the U.S. government. Sully discloses that Skiles has been requested for an academic lecture in Lebanon, and hands him money, a plane ticket, and a passport. Skiles is initially resistant but decides to travel to Beirut. He meets several government officials, including CIA officer Donald Gaines, Colonel Gary Ruzak of the NSA, and Ambassador Frank Whalen, along with CIA officer Sandy Crowder, and learns that Cal Riley was recently abducted in Lebanon. The kidnappers have specifically requested Skiles as the negotiator. The group meets with the kidnappers and find Karim heading the organization. Karim demands the release of his brother in exchange for Riley, despite the Americans' protest that they do not have Rafid in captivity. Skiles suspects that Israel is holding Rafid, and travels with Ruzak to secure his release. The Israelis reveal that they do not have Rafid, and Skiles returns to Beirut to meet with Alice, Riley's wife. Alice holds Skiles responsible for Riley's abduction, believing that Riley has remained in Lebanon over the guilt he feels for Nadia's death. The next day, while Skiles is conducting the lecture at the American University of Beirut (the official reason for his visit), a car bomb is set off outside the building. In the ensuing chaos, Skiles is instructed to leave to meet Karim. Karim brings him to Riley, who covertly tells Skiles that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is holding Rafid and that Gaines is not to be trusted. Before releasing Skiles, Karim threatens that unless Rafid is returned later that night, he will sell Riley to Iran. Skiles returns to Riley's apartment to search for clues, where he encounters Crowder. She reveals that Gaines had been stealing money from the embassy and that Riley had been preparing to make a report shortly before his disappearance. Skiles convinces Crowder that the PLO is holding Rafid, and she steals $4 million from the CIA office to trade for Rafid. Crowder and Skiles lead an attack on a PLO officer in order to force a trade for Rafid. After a payoff to his PLO captors, they bring him to the exchange with Karim. After trading Riley for Rafid, Rafid is shot and killed by a Mossad sniper in a nearby building. The Americans successfully escape. The Mossad sniper is actually Bernard who originally met Skiles when he arrived to Beirut. Bernard meets Sandrine, the mistress of the PLO officer whom Skiles attacked, who is also an Israeli agent, and leaves on a helicopter. Before departing Beirut, Skiles learns that Gaines has unexpectedly retired and that Ruzak has left Beirut. Crowder announces her intention to apply for the newly vacant station chief job, and Skiles offers his services as a negotiator. As the film ends, news footage is shown of the subsequent Israeli invasion of Lebanon, increasing international involvement in the country, and, finally, the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Marine Corps' barracks in Beirut in 1983.

Dennis Harvey of Variety called the film an \\"agreeably old-school form of cinematic espionage intrigue.\\" John DeFore, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, characterized it as a \\"period political thriller whose motivations remain timely.\\" The Financial Times Damon Wise wrote that \\"Beirut proves surprisingly sensitive in its handling of the Middle East, mapping out an area of nuanced power struggle rather than a cartoon Casablanca-style warzone.\\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said that \\"this is Hamm‚Äôs best leading role to date, a reminder of how good he can be when he‚Äôs given the right material.\\" Trailer criticism The film's trailer received criticism from social media users for dehumanizing Arabs and Muslims, having a white savior narrative, ignoring political complexities of the Lebanese Civil War, and failing to show Lebanese people as fully formed characters. The trailer's closing tagline of \\"2,000 years of revenge, vendetta, murder... welcome to Beirut\\" has been criticized as a confusing misrepresentation of the history of Beirut. The trailer was criticized by Sopan Deb in The New York Times. He called it offensive, portraying a stereotypical image of Lebanese, Arabs and the Middle East at large. He points out that no Lebanese actors are featured in the film, and cites a social media hashtag, #BoycottBeirutMovie, as evidence of the trailer's reception in Lebanon. Walaa Chahine, writing for the Huffington Post, echoed similar criticisms, arguing that the trailer \\"seems to follow the same rhetoric so many other Middle East thrillers like to portray - Arabs are barbaric and uncivilized, and their countries are a mess\\".

They are connected by tunnels at the head of the Fosca Valley, at Lleida. The network of lakes provide water to Lake Gento (Estany Gento) where there are two hydroelectric plants, Sallente Reservoir, and Central Hidroelectrica de Cabdella. This system is located in the municipality of La Torre de Cabdella, in the county of Pallars Juss√†. Geography Cabdella Lakes is a complex system of water storage and resources, which is used by area consumers. It incorporates the Flamisell River, which is part of the Noguera Pallaresa basin. The system was created by the interconnection of approximately 30 glacial lakes, many of which were enlarged with the erection of a small dam which increased the lakes' original capacity. The Sallente Reservoir regulates the system at Lake Gento. The Central Hidroelectrica de Cabdella was constructed in 1985. This hydroelectric plant uses the water collected by a large network of underground channels which were built in the early 20th century. The hydroelectric plant is reversible, using the surplus electricity produced at certain times of the day.

He launched two rebellions against the Ottoman government, the second and largest of which ended with his assassination in Aleppo on 16 February 1659 following a failed attempt to force the deposition of the Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha. [in Turkish] Abaza Hasan first gained prominence in 1648 by defeating the Anatolian rebel Kara Haydaroƒülu, for which he was rewarded with the rank of voyvoda (overseer) of the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen. After this office was taken from him through palace intrigue, he launched his first revolt, occupying territory in northwestern Anatolia. During this time he rallied to his side other military men with grievances against the government as well as thousands of the sekban and sarƒ±ca characteristic of the Celali Rebellions. He eventually achieved his goals, recovering his office and reconciling his relationship with the central government. In the following years he was promoted to the rank of pasha and received the governorship of various provinces in the east. In the summer of 1658 he launched a second revolt, this time in response to the wide-ranging purges and executions carried out by Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha. Despite being joined by a significant portion of the Ottoman military establishment, Abaza Hasan and his allies were unable to enforce their demand for K√∂pr√ºl√º's execution either by winning the support of Sultan Mehmed IV or by achieving a major military victory. Lured into the government-held city of Aleppo by promises of pardon, they were suddenly assassinated by the order of the loyalist commanders who had been sent against them. As the last of the major Celali rebels, Abaza Hasan's defeat marked the end of a long period of instability in Anatolia. The region had suffered from repeated rebellion by provincial governors ever since the time of the revolt of Abaza Mehmed Pasha in 1622. While some minor outbreaks of rebellion continued to occur during the following era, the province generally benefited from the stability associated with K√∂pr√ºl√º rule. Abaza Hasan's failure to depose K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed enabled that family of viziers to continue administering the empire uninterrupted for another twenty-four years, until Kara Mustafa Pasha's execution following the unsuccessful Siege of Vienna in 1683. Biography Early career A sixteenth-century Western depiction of a sipahi, a position in which Abaza Hasan served in his youth. Nothing is known of Abaza Hasan's life before 1648, except that he was by origin a member of the sipƒÅhiyƒÅn, the first of the six divisions of imperial cavalry (Altƒ± B√∂l√ºk). [in Turkish] He first entered the historical record in 1648, serving Hacƒ± Sinanzade Mehmed Pasha as his m√ºtesellim (deputy-governor) in the Sanjak (sub-province) of Hamid, in southwest Anatolia. There he earned a reputation for bravery and military prowess by defending the city of Isparta from the rebel Kara Haydaroƒülu, who had been harassing nearby caravans and villages. While previous commanders sent to subdue him had been thwarted, Abaza Hasan ambushed and captured him in a night attack. Kara Haydaroƒülu was delivered to Istanbul and executed on 12 November 1648. For his service, Abaza Hasan was given robes of honor and rewarded with the rank of voyvoda (overseer) of the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen, at that time a lucrative post in Eastern Anatolia. [in Turkish] First revolt The Ottoman government during the early years of the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648‚Äì1687) was rife with factional disputes and power struggles. [in Turkish] Thus in 1651, after three years of faithfully carrying out service overseeing the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen, he was suddenly removed from office at the insistence of a palace faction of Ocak Aghas (janissary commanders) led by Bekta≈ü Agha. Despite the intercession of the ≈ûeyh√ºlisl√¢m Kara√ßelebizade Abdulaziz Efendi, he was unable to regain his office. The grand vizier Melek Ahmed Pasha recognized the injustice which Abaza Hasan had suffered, but was too reliant on the support of the Aghas to be willing to help. A contemporary source depicts him fuming with rage and swearing revenge upon the Ocak Aghas. Giving up on the legal means of recompense, he and his supporters left Istanbul and began gathering an army in Anatolia, demanding either the return of his office or 60,000 guru≈ü (silver coins of foreign origin) in compensation. [in Turkish] Abaza Hasan first attacked the environs of Iznikmid (Modern Izmit), before directing his forces against the Ocak Aghas who had sought his removal. He assaulted a caravan of horses and camels carrying 30,000 guru≈ü in the name of Bekta≈ü Agha, killing the agent who had been in charge of it. He next marched to Kastamonu, defeating its governor and looting the city, all while gathering more recruits to his banner. The next target was Bekta≈ü Agha's privately owned farmlands in the vicinity of Ankara. To prevent his city from being attacked, the qadi (judge) of Ankara assisted Abaza Hasan in capturing the Agha's agents. The governor of Bolu, Canbolad Deli Hasan, was then assigned to suppress the rebels, but Abaza Hasan's military success and charisma led segments of his army to defect to the rebel side. [in Turkish] As Deli Hasan was helpless to resist, the government next assigned the Beylerbeyi of Sivas, Ib≈üir Mustafa Pasha, to lead the fight against Abaza Hasan. Disastrously for the government, rather than fighting, the two men began to cooperate. They found common ground in their shared Abazan ethnicity, and agreed to join forces. When they together defeated the army assembled by the next challenger, Karaman Beylerbeyi Katƒ±rcƒ±oƒülu Mehmed Pasha, the government finally recognized its inability to suppress the rebellion. Istanbul experienced a political revolution with the assassination of K√∂sem Sultan on 2 September 1651, and the Ocak Aghas who had been her allies were removed from power. Thus Abaza Hasan's most intractable rivals were eliminated, opening the way to peace. The rebels reached an accommodation with the government whereby Abaza Hasan recovered his office of voyvoda of the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen, while Ib≈üir Pasha became the governor of Aleppo. Abaza Hasan thus achieved his initial goal, as well as having developed a reputation as a highly competent and successful leader. [in Turkish] Alliance with Ib≈üir Pasha Following the conclusion of their revolt, Abaza Hasan continued to maintain close ties with the more politically experienced Ib≈üir Pasha. During his period of governance in Aleppo, Ib≈üir laid out his plans for reforming the Ottoman state by bringing an end to corruption and bribery. He attempted to convince the other Anatolian governors to support his plans, and kept Abaza Hasan, who was now a powerful and influential figure in Anatolia, by his side. The two of them played a decisive role in eastern Anatolian politics during this period: when Abaza Hasan's ally Hadƒ±m Karƒ±nda≈üƒ± had his office revoked, they came to his aid and defeated the army of his replacement in battle. [in Turkish] In August 1653 Abaza Hasan traveled to Istanbul with his entourage to facilitate Ib≈üir Pasha's appointment to the grand vizierate. There he remained, temporarily divesting himself of his duties with the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen. When Ib≈üir finally achieved his desired appointment in October 1654, Abaza Hasan returned to Aleppo and accompanied him to Istanbul, acting as a trusted advisor for the duration of his tenure. [in Turkish] Yet Ib≈üir Pasha's opponent Kara Murad Pasha ultimately got the better of him by convincing his longtime ally K√ºrd Mehmed Agha to betray him, resulting in Ib≈üir Pasha's execution on 11 May 1655. K√ºrd Mehmed had been an ally of Abaza Hasan's during his 1651 revolt, and he felt deeply offended by this betrayal. [in Turkish] As K√ºrd Mehmed was in league with the new grand vizier, Abaza Hasan was forced to flee to Anatolia along with his supporters and allies. Later career K√ºrd Mehmed took for himself Abaza Hasan's former post as voyvoda of the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen, and subsequently sought to undermine Ib≈üir Pasha's other former supporters. One of these was Seydi Ahmed Pasha, who had recently been appointed governor of Karaman. While Seydi was on his way to the provincial capital, Konya, K√ºrd Mehmed entered the city and convinced the population to resist the incoming governor, warning of his tyranny. Thus when Seydi arrived, he found the city armed against him with K√ºrd Mehmed organizing its defense. This led to an alliance between Seydi Ahmed and Abaza Hasan, as the two of them besieged Konya together, driving K√ºrd Mehmed out of the city. Yet by this time, orders had arrived from Istanbul removing Seydi from his post and assigning him to Aleppo instead. When Seydi and Abaza Hasan arrived, they found that K√ºrd Mehmed had done the same thing there as well, rallying the population of Aleppo to defend the city against them. Ultimately, Aleppo fell into Seydi's hands and K√ºrd Mehmed fled to Adana, where he and his men were killed. [in Turkish] With the appointment of Boynueƒüri Mehmed Pasha as grand vizier on 26 April 1656, Abaza Hasan again came into favor at court. He was granted the rank of pasha and appointed governor of Diyarbakƒ±r. He also continued to administer the Yeni Il T√ºrkmen through his keth√ºda (steward), who was granted the office. On 2 February 1657 he was transferred to Aleppo, the final post he would ever hold. Second revolt The grand vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha (1656‚Äì1661), whom Abaza Hasan sought to overthrow. The teenaged Mehmed IV, shortly before Abaza Hasan's revolt. Abaza Hasan's promotion to the major governorships of Diyarbakƒ±r and Aleppo coincided with another major development in Ottoman history: the beginning of the K√∂pr√ºl√º Era. K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha had been given the office of grand vizier on 15 September 1656, and since then began carrying out major reforms of the Ottoman state. Some of these aroused widespread opposition, such as the purges he carried out against the Altƒ± B√∂l√ºk cavalry regiments (of which Abaza Hasan had once been a member). In particular, after his return to Edirne from the 1657 campaign to reconquer the islands of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Limni (Lemnos), K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed ordered a massacre of all the cavalry soldiers he suspected of disloyalty - in the words of one historian, strewing the banks of the Tunca River with corpses. Abaza Hasan already had a history of disloyalty toward K√∂pr√ºl√º: In 1657 K√∂pr√ºl√º had ordered the execution of the governor of Egypt, and Abaza Hasan secretly aided his escape through Aleppo. Thus, when the order was given for the army to assemble for a campaign against Transylvania, Abaza Hasan and his allies chose not to heed the call. Instead, they gathered at Konya with an army of 30,000, and pledged to oppose K√∂pr√ºl√º. [in Turkish] Their forces included a significant portion of the Ottoman military, including the governors of Damascus, Anatolia, Raqqa, and Aleppo, which Abaza Hasan himself governed. The rebels were further supported by members of the imperial cavalry regiments who had fled from K√∂pr√ºl√º's purges. Initially the rebels concealed their motives, declaring that they intended to join the campaign. Yet their failure to arrive ultimately forced K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed to depart without them, and he set off toward the frontier on 24 June 1658. It was only then that Abaza Hasan and his compatriots revealed their true intentions by sending an emissary to Sultan Mehmed IV, and declaring that continuing to serve the state was intolerable so long as K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed was not killed. They stated that their revolt was a response to the grand vizier having killed so many innocent men, and their fear that he would turn on them next. The rebel army then began its march from Konya to Bursa, the premier city of Ottoman Anatolia. Along the way Abaza Hasan issued orders preventing his troops from looting the countryside in an attempt to establish his public image as a fighter for justice. Yet even when his army surrounded Bursa and occupied the nearby towns and villages, the sultan continued to decisively stand behind his grand vizier and reject the demands of the rebels, referring to them as the servants of the Devil. Bursa successfully resisted the rebels throughout thirty days of siege, despite the defection of its commander Kenan Pasha to the rebel side. Abaza Hasan's failure to capture this city proved decisive in undermining the long-term viability of his revolt. As the grand vizier was away on campaign with the imperial army, command of the loyalist forces was assigned to Murtaza Pasha, who was at that time charged with the defense of the eastern frontier with the Safavids, with whom the Ottomans were at peace. He was ordered to assemble the armies of the eastern governors to defeat Abaza Hasan. Simultaneously, the ≈ûeyh√ºlisl√¢m Bolevi Mustafa Efendi issued a fatwa declaring Abaza Hasan to be sa øƒ´ bi-l-fesƒÅd, or \\"a formenter of corruption,\\" thus sanctioning the death penalty for him. The Sultan also issued a general call for the populace to take up arms against the rebels, and K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed was recalled from Transylvania, where he had successfully conquered the fortress town of Yanova (modern Ineu). Upon his return at the beginning of November, salaries were distributed to the imperial troops. All those who failed to appear had their names erased from the muster rolls, amounting to some 7,000 men, or one third of all imperial cavalrymen. [in Turkish] Some of the rebel troops sought at this point to rejoin the loyalist side and claim their salaries, causing instability in the rebel ranks. As it were, the formerly rebellious cavalrymen who arrived in Istanbul found only executioners waiting for them. With Murtaza Pasha's army approaching, the rebels opted to abandon their positions in western Anatolia. Abaza Hasan returned to the region near Konya, near to where he had defeated Kara Haydaroƒülu ten years previously. There, on 11 December 1658, he attacked Murtaza's army outside the town of Ilgƒ±n and inflicted on him a severe defeat, demonstrating once again his military skill. Despite this, the severity of the winter led him to continue his retreat. The rebel forces ultimately established winter quarters in the southeast Anatolian city of Ayntab (modern Gaziantep), while Murtaza and what was left of his army spent the winter in Aleppo, which had been seized from the rebels earlier in the year. [in Turkish] [in Turkish] Assassination A cannon was fired from the Aleppo Citadel (pictured in 2010) to signal that Abaza Hasan had been killed. By early 1659, Abaza Hasan's army was suffering greatly from lack of supplies in the unusually harsh winter. In response to the increasingly vocal complaints coming from his troops, including the open defection of several thousand of them to the loyalist side, he accepted the impossibility of his victory and opened negotiations with Murtaza Pasha, using the Mufti of Ayntab as an intermediary. In exchange for vows of safety and pardon, he and his top commanders agreed to surrender and enter the city of Aleppo, while their army remained encamped outside. The rebels were then lodged in the mansions of the loyalist pashas, with Abaza Hasan residing with Murtaza. The two sides conversed cordially over the course of several days, and drafted letters to be sent to the capital, asking for pardon for the rebels. Despite this, at the time of the night prayer on 16 February 1659, [in Turkish] the loyalists carried out a plot to murder their unsuspecting guests. While Abaza Hasan was preparing for prayer by performing ablutions, assassins approached and cut his throat from behind. A cannon was then fired from the Aleppo Citadel, indicating to the other pashas that it was time to massacre the remaining rebel leaders. Historians disagree on the motive for this sudden betrayal. Some attest that Murtaza ordered the massacre out of distrust, while others are of the opinion that Abaza Hasan was himself actively preparing to seize Aleppo from within, and Murtaza took action to preempt this. [in Turkish] Abaza Hasan's head was severed and stuffed with straw to be put on display in Istanbul, and his body was hung outside of one of Aleppo's city gates, serving as a public demonstration that the revolt had been crushed. Personal life and character Abaza Hasan was described in contemporary sources primarily in negative terms, as Ottoman writers sought to emphasize the suffering and oppression peasants and townspeople experienced at the hands of his troops. [in Turkish] He was particularly demonized for launching his rebellion at the same time as the Ottomans were engaged in warfare with non-Muslims. [In Ottoman Turkish] Nevertheless, many positive traits were still attributed to him, particularly with regard to his military skill. The traveler Evliya √áelebi, who met Abaza Hasan on numerous occasions, described him as \\"the most courageous and brave of all the Abazan people; diligent, proud, a true hero.\\" [in Turkish] During his second uprising, his cause also received a great deal of popular support in Istanbul, particularly among the religious preachers, who heralded him as the 'renewer of the faith of the eleventh century'. Thus Abaza Hasan's public image among contemporaries was highly variable, ranging from that of a messianic figure destined to bring about justice, to a cruel and oppressive bandit. Abaza Hasan is known to have had a daughter, who married a man known as Hamamcƒ±oƒülu (\\"Son of the Bath-attendant\\"). Hamamcƒ±oƒülu played a major role during Abaza Hasan's second revolt, acting as his agent in Aleppo while his father-in-law was away with the army. In late 1658 Hamamcƒ±oƒülu was chased out of Aleppo and killed by the loyalist army.

It was served by the predecessor of today's MARC Penn Line until August 1982. History The Baltimore and Potomac Railroad opened its Washington Branchsoon thereafter its main linein 1872. The B&P; was formally acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1902, which in turn folded into Penn Central in 1968. By this time, Lanham station was served only by a limited number of Baltimore- Washington commuter trips; intercity trains generally did not stop. The station then consisted of just a small wooden shelter and an asphalt platform on the northwest side of the tracks; the station building was long gone. The grade crossing at Lanham Station Road was likely closed in 1970 when Penn Central eliminated several such grade crossings in Prince George's County as part of the construction of Capital Beltway station for the Metroliner service. Conrail took over the ex-PRR Baltimore-Washington service from Penn Central at its creation on April 1, 1976. Conrail added an asphalt platform on the southeast side of the tracks and three-sided iron shelters on both sides. However, the company was displeased with the station; it was in the middle of a sharp reverse curve with poor sightlines from trains, which resulted in several pedestrians being struck by high-speed trains. In August 1982, Conrail commuter trains began stopping at Capital Beltway station, which had been used by intercity trains since 1970. This allowed Conrail to close the nearby Lanham and Landover stations. Amtrak and AMDOT (the ex-Conrail service, soon thereafter the Penn Line) abandoned Capital Beltway on October 30, 1983, in favor of nearby New Carrollton, which had been a Washington Metro stop since 1978. The grade crossing was closed to pedestrians at some point after the station was abandoned.

Syria Track II Dialogue Initiative In order to put an end to the intractable Syrian conflict ‚Äì a war that has caused more than half a million casualties, over five million refugees, and increasing threats to regional and global stability ‚Äì we believe that Syrians of all creeds and backgrounds must be given the opportunity and neutral space to come together and decide the future of their country. Launched in 2013 with the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Doha Center, the Initiative run by The Shaikh Group‚Äôs team has consulted with hundreds of influential Syrians from a range of political, military, civil society, and economic backgrounds through a series of workshops and smaller meetings that allow these parties to build relationships, establish mutual trust, and together elaborate elements of a political solution. . In 2015, these meetings led to the drafting of a detailed position paper outlining key steps for a Syrian-led political process, with the input and buy-in of project participants. This position paper has since been used by Syrians involved in the Initiative as a tool for building consensus around agreed principles for a political transition that involves all Syrians.

There are several small hills in this area(Aduputty, Cherukunnu, Kizhoor, Kakkad Mission Kunnu, etc.) interspersed with the numerous ponds of the area(Eeenjakulam, Ayyankulam, Madurakulam, Chattukulam, etc.). One of the major spots within the town is the Parayil Angadi (market among rocks). The terrain condition and geological aspect of the area has led to the name. Kunnamkulam town has its own remote antiquity as is evident from the history. It was a part of Mahodayapattanam, the capital of Chera Dynasty. History tells about the cross installed by Thomas the Apostle, at Chattukulangara (a part of Arthat in Kunnamkulam). During the invasion of Tippu Sultan the Christians from Chattakulangara migrated to Kunnamkulam town. Manakulam, Cheralayam and Kakkaad (the suburbs of Kunnamkulam) were the seats of the Nambidis of Manakulam, Ayinikur and Kakkad Karanavappad respectively. They were collectively known as Thalappilli Rajas and belonged to three branches of the same dynasty. The history of Kunnamkulam goes back to the Paleolithic age. The Kakkaad cave and Chowannur cave support this fact. It is said that this place was part of ‚ÄòMahodayaPattanam‚Äô and was known as ‚ÄòKunnamkulangare‚Äô. C. Achutha Menon in the Cochin State Manual says that, ‚Äúit is in fact the chief center of the Orthodox Christians of the State, and there are several of their old churches in the town and its neighborhood‚Äù. Moreover, ‚ÄúMost of the oldest and wealthiest Christian families are to be found in Kunnamkulam‚Äù. Cheruvathoor, Pulikkottil, Chungath, Kollannoor, Panakkal, Paramel, Thengungal, Cheeran, Kanjirathingal, Moolapath, Tholath, Kakkassery and Emmatty are the most prominent among them. The competition for ascendancy between these wealthy families, opened up new dimensions in the development of printing and other literary activities. Panakkal Chakku, Cheru, Thengungal Ittoop, Varu and Koothur Paramel Iyyu Uttoop were arbitrators of some of these families. It is said that the Christian families were settled earlier at Chattukulangare shifted to Kunnamkulam after the invasion of Tippu in 1789. They were invited by the Thalappilli Rajas, provided residences and places of worship. They resided on both sides of the street. This may have helped to avoid threat from Tippu against Thalappilli Rajas. Those settled on both sides of the street started trade and business, and began a new era of transaction. Etymology A cyber campaign was started that resulted in the changing of the often-misspelt name ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥¶‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç(kundamkulam), to ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç(kunnamkulam) Apparently the wrong spelling \\" ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥¶‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç(kundamkulam) \\" was being used for the city name on the Buses, Sign boards, Publications etc. This issue was brought into the social medias, where people unanimously opined to correct the spelling to ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç kunnamkulam. This online debate further developed into a great discussion amongst the public and in all the other medias. The issue finally came in front of the Municipal Council meeting which laid down the rule to not use the wrong spelling ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥¶‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç for ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç anywhere. History of Kodungallur It is postulated that the ancient city of Muziris( Muchiripattinam,Mahodayapuram/Vanchi) was devastated by natural calamities--a flood or an earth quake--in 1341, and consequently lost its commercial importance thereafter. Further, it came under military attacks on various occasions: in 1504 by the Portuguese-Kochi allied forces during their movement against Calicut in 1524, by the Mappilas during their attack against the Portuguese, and in 1565 again by the Portuguese. Etymology The name Kodungallur is derived from Kodi-linga-ur (\\"the land of 10 million Sivalingas ur-village\\") according to common belief. Kodungallur was perhaps the revenue collection center of Kuda-kons (the Chera rulers) for the goods coming to the nearby port, hence the name Kudakonallur, which later shortened to Kodungallur. Historically, Kodungallur has been identified as Mahodaya Puram, Mahavanchimana Pattanam, Thrikulasekarapuram, Jangli, Gingaleh, Cyngilin, Shinkali, Chinkli, Jinkali, Shenkala, and Cynkali, which are all derived from the name of the River Changala (or the Chain river, i.e., Shrinkhala in Sanskrit), a tributary of Periyar.For a large number of such names for Kodungallir down the centuries arranged more or less chronologically cf. K. P. Padbhanabha Menon, History of Kerala Vol. I, quoted by George Menachery in Kodungallur, 1987, reprinted 2000. Columguria, Kotilingapuram, Kudalingapuram, Kodunkaliyur, Thiruvallur, Ravivisvapuram and Balakreetapuram are a few other names, identified as Kodungallur in various related records or literary works. Chera period 18th century depiction of the Hindu temple at Kodungallur Kodungallur was an integral part of Mahodayapuram, the capital city of the Later Chera dynasty. The Roman empire had a continuous trading connection with this region. Along with pepper, commodities such as pearls, muslin, ivory, diamond, silk and perfumes were exported using the maritime facilities of Kodungallur. Sulaiman, an Arab visitor to Mahodayapuram during this period, recorded the economic prosperity of the region and also testified to the high morals kept by its people. Also, he describes the Chinese traders in the city; they are described as purchasing articles such as pepper, cinnamon, ivory, pearls, cotton fabrics and teak wood, while selling fishing nets, silk and porcelain goods. In the 11th century, Mahodayapuram (Now it is known as Kandanad) was captured by Rajendra Chola I of Chola dynasty. For the next few centuries, Kodungallur was a principality, named Padinjattedathu Swaroopam, under the control of a royal family, Kodungallur Kovilakam, allied either to kingdom of Cochin or to Calicut. Muziris is supposed to be destroyed by massive flooding of Periyar in the 14th century and consequently, the trade got diverted to other ancient ports of the Malabar coast, such as Kochi. The tradition of Thomas the Apostle Relic of St. Thomas, kept in the sanatorium of a Syrian Church in Kodungallur Traditional belief of Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala is that Thomas the Apostle landed in or around Kodungallur in the middle of the 1st century and founded Seven Churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor (Chattukulangara) and Thiruvithamcode Arappally ‚Äì a \\"half church\\". According to one view, a Cochin Jew colony in Malabar Coast (later named Anjuvannam near Kodungallur), probably established before the 6th century BC, attracted the Apostle to this region.  Cheraman Juma Masjid  The tradition holds that Cheraman Juma Masjid in Kodungallur, built in 629 AD by MƒÅlik bin Dƒ´nƒÅr, is the oldest mosque in India and the second oldest mosque in the world to offer Jumu'ah prayers.Cheraman Juma Masjid A Secular Heritage Constructed during the lifetime of Muhammad, the bodies of some of his original followers are said to be buried there. Unlike other mosques in the region that face westwards this mosque faces east. The legend has it that a group of Muhammad's ·π¢a·∏•ƒÅba (companions) visited Kodungallur. An unknown Chera dynasty ruler had witnessed a miraculous happening ‚Äî the sudden splitting of the moon, the celebrated miracle of Muhammad ‚Äî and learned on inquiry that this was a symbol of the coming of a Messenger of God from Arabia. Soon after, the Chera ruler traveled to Makkah, where he embraced Islam, and accepted the name \\"Tajuddin\\". On his way back to India he died at Salalah in Oman. On his deathbed he is said to have authorised some of his Arab companions to go back to his kingdom to spread Islam. Accordingly, a group of Arabs led by MƒÅlik bin Dƒ´nƒÅr and MƒÅlik bin Habib arrived in northern Chera kingdom and constructed the Cheraman Juma Masjid at Kodungalloor. Cape of Kodungallur, where Periyar empties into Arabian Sea. Chinese fishing nets in the beach, believed to be installed by 14th century Chinese explorer, Zheng He, have also become a popular tourist attraction. Recent history The glory of Kodungallur, as a global trade centre, is believed to be destroyed by natural calamities. According to one view it was heavy floods in the river Periyar that destroyed the city in 1341, while others point out to an earth quake in this regard. The floods further split the left branch of the river into two, just before the city of Aluva. The flood silted the right branch (known as River Changala) and the natural harbour at the mouth of the river to make it poorly navigable for large ships. The misfortune of Kodungallur helped other major ports of Malabar coast, such as the one at Kochi, to rise to prominence. Colonial period During Portuguese period, Kodungallur was a tributary state in the kingdom of Zamorin, the most powerful of independent rulers of Malabar region. Since the location of Kodungallur sandwiched between the kingdom of Zamorin and the kingdom of Kochi, it was often a matter of dispute for both the kings and sometimes the chieftain of Kodungallur switched the allegiance. Portuguese landed in Calicut in 1498 and soon they reached in an agreement with the Zamorin for establishing their trade with his subjects and also to open a factory in Calicut. Nonetheless, Portuguese forces tried to establish monopoly in spice trade using violent methods against the Arabs and other Muslim merchants from the Middle East, who had a longstanding loyal relation with the Zamorin. In fact, encouraged by foreign Muslims afraid of losing their monopoly on the spice trade (that also benefited the Venetians)Calicut was the only independent state in the Indian Ocean region at that time to militarily meet the Portuguese transgressions in the region, whereas Kochi opted to ally with the foreign Christians to contain the aggression of the Zamorin. Zamorin's period The tussle between Zamorin and Portuguese, though started arising in 1500, broke into the form of a regional war in 1504. Portuguese forces extended their attack on Calicut to allied coastal states, including Kodungallur. The town was almost completely destroyed by the Portuguese (Suarez de Menezes) on 1 September 1504. Kodungallur, being a port city at the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, was a strategic entry point for Zamorin's army and fleet into the Kerala backwaters. Hence, in October 1504 Zamorin dispatched a force to fortify Kodungallur. Reading this movement as a preparation for a renewed attack on Kochi, the Portuguese commander, Lopo Soares, ordered a preemptive strike. A squadron of around ten fighting ships, accompanied with numerous fighting boats of Kochi, headed up to Kodungallur. The heavier ships, unable to make their way into the shallow channels, anchored at Palliport (Pallipuram, on the outer edge of Vypin island), while smaller frigates progressed to the destination. Converging on Kodungallur, the Portuguese-Kochi fleet quickly dispersed the Calicut forces on the beach using cannon, and launched their composite army ‚Äì some 1,000 Portuguese soldiers and 1,000 Nair warriors of Kochi ‚Äì who took on the rest of the enemy force in Kodungallur.Castanheda, p.272 The assault troops captured and sacked the city of Kodungallur, and was set on fire by the squads led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira and Diogo Fernandes Correa. Nonetheless, according to some records, Portuguese arsonists spared the Saint Thomas Christian quarters in the city. (At the time the community was in a tenuous position: though thriving in the spice trade and protected by their own militia, the local political sphere was volatile and the Saint Thomas Christians had found themselves under pressure from the rajas of Calicut, Cochin and other small kingdoms in the area. Hence the community had sought an alliance with the Portuguese newcomers. Since they were one of the major suppliers of pepper in the region, Portuguese also found the relation as reciprocating.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, 122‚Äì124. Oxford University Press. .) This might have helped the ancient Christian community of Kodungallur from extinction during the 1504 assault on the city. Calicut fleet The Calicut fleet, some five ships and 80 paraus, that had been dispatched to save the city was intercepted by the idling Portuguese ships near Palliport and defeated in a naval encounter.Mathew (1997: p.14) In the meantime, the raja of the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettattnad), whose kingdom lay to the north, on the road between Calicut and Kodungallur, who had a spoiled relation with the Zamorin, offered to place himself under Portuguese suzerainty. It is recorded that the military of Calicut, which was led by Zamorin in person, was defeated on their way to Kodungallur by a sizeable Portuguese army with the assistance of the Tanur ruler. The raid on Cranganore and the defection of the Tanur raja were serious setbacks to the Zamorin of Calicut, pushing the frontline north and effectively placing the Vembanad lagoon out of the Zamorin's reach. The battle set the scene for Portuguese to expand their colonial authority over a significant area of the Malabar coast. By 1510, their fluid power in the Malabar coast solidified into a perceptible territorial entity. In 1662, the Dutch entered the competition, sacked the Portuguese in a fortnightly war, with the help of Zamorin, and occupied Kodungallur. The Dutch took the control of Kodungallur fort in 1663 and it eventually protected the southern Kerala, especially Travancore, from the Mysorean invasion in 1776. In 1786, Mysorean troops again marched to northern Kerala, but failed to progress ahead of Kodungallur. On 31 July 1789, the Dutch handed over their establishments in Kodungallur and Azhikode to the Kingdom of Travancore for 300,000 Surat silver rupees. Archaeology Until the 1980s, it was generally believed that Kodungallur and Muziris were synonymous from the historical point of view. In 1983, a large hoard of Roman coins was excavated at a site in a small town, called Pattanam, about six miles from Kodungallur. Now this location is one of the most significant archaeological sites in South Asia. The excavations carried out at Pattanam from 2007 to 2011 have uncovered a plethora of archaeologically important materials: over 20,000 articles have now been recovered including terracotta objects, beads, amphora pieces, cannonballs and four skeletons. It has prompted many historians to hypothesize Pattanam as the location of Muziris. Kodungallur fort Relics of the Cranganore Fort built by the Portuguese on the shores of the Kottapuram River Cranganore Fort, also known as Kottappuram/Kottapuram Fort, was built by Portuguese in 1523 and later in 1565 it was enlarged. The fort was named as Fortaleza Sao Tome, by the Portuguese. The Dutch took possession of the fort in 1663. The remains of the fort show that the original fort wall was 18 feet in thickness. The ruin is also known as Tipu's fort. Muziris Heritage Project A project, named Muziris Heritage Project, was launched by the Department of Cultural Affairs, Kerala in 2006 to scientifically retrieve and preserve the historical heritage of the region, extending from North Paravur to Kodungallur. The project envisages a combination of heritage management initiatives in its restoration, conservation and access to the public. Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR), identified as the nodal agency for Muziris Heritage Project, provides academic guidance and undertakes archaeological and historical research in the region.Kerala Council for Historical Research The first phase of Muziris Heritage Project was opened to the nation by HE the president of India Shri.

Walker Stadium at Lents Park is a baseball stadium located in Lents Park in the Lents neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It has been home to the West Coast League Portland Pickles baseball team since 2016. The Pickles play thirty home games per sixty game season. The team pays rent to the City, cleans the stadium, and provides security during games. Outside of the dates set aside for the team, the stadium is open for permitted play by anyone who reserves it. The Northwest Independent Baseball League plays many of its games at Walker Stadium. The ballpark has hosted as many as 1,877 fans for a Pickles game. History The City of Portland purchased 32 acres from private owners in the 1940s and 1950s to assemble land between SE 88 and 92 and SE Holgate and Steele to expand Lents Park. The city prepared a central plan in 1953 to propose locations for a baseball stadium, playing fields, tennis courts, community buildings, pathways, and parking areas. Construction on the stadium began in 1956 and included lights for night games. The stadium was named for Charles B. Walker, the city's first Sports Director in 1935 who helped organize the first men's and women's softball tournaments held west of the Mississippi, and in 1950 was appointed as commissioner of the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) for the Portland area. In 2008, Merritt Paulson, owner of the Portland Beavers examined building an 8,000 to 9,000 seat minor league ballpark on the site of Walker Stadium for $45 million. Paulson planned to begin construction in March 2010, and the Beavers would play there in 2011. The location was eventually rejected for the Beavers due to objections from neighbors. 2016 Renovation In March 2015, Portland and Great West League officials announced plans to renovate the stadium, adding 500 seats and concessions and complementing the city's urban renewal goals for the Lents neighborhood. Walker Stadium was supposed to have received upgrades as part of a 1994 bond measure but other municipal projects competed for limited funding. Under the plans, the public-private partnership of the Portland Pickles, Portland Parks & Recreation, and the Portland Development Commission spent $650,000 to upgrade the city-owned ballpark with Portland's urban renewal agency paying $200,000, the parks bureau $50,000, and the baseball team $400,000. The renovations included new seating with chair-backs, new scoreboard, new dugouts, new grass, a playground, and other improvements. The team agreed to pay $200 per-game in rent with payments beginning in 2016 and annual 3.5 percent increases. The renovation was completed in June 2016 on schedule for the Pickles' first game.

It is situated across the Quezon City Hall. History The Quezon Heritage House is a reconstructed version of the house at 45 Gilmore Street in New Manila which served as residence of former President Manuel Quezon's family. The Quezons moved to the house in 1927 when it was offered to them after Manuel Quezon contracted tuberculosis. The house's living room was also the site where the Philippine National Red Cross was established by the consent of Aurora Aragon Quezon. The house was used as a weekend home by the Quezons until they were forced to flee to Corregidor in 1941 during the World War II. Manuel Quezon died in 1944 and his family moved back to the house on the next year. The Quezons acquired the house on installment and managed to acquire three adjacent properties near the house. It once again became the weekend house of the family and was later occupied by the family of Maria Zeneida Quezon-Avance√±a. Quezon-Avance√±a later moved out of the house to reside in Alabang due to health reasons. It was during the administration of then Feliciano Belmonte Jr. that plans to preserve the house was made. Belmonte approached the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and had talks on the city government's prospects of acquiring the house, as well as the registration of the building as a heritage site but the house did not meet all requirements for the designation. The house was transferred and preserved to the Quezon Memorial Circle by the city government under the administration of Mayor Herbert Bautista. On April 2013, a new foundation was laid for the house and the house, then in Gilmore was disassembled. The parts of the house were removed with care and was used for restoration. The disassembling process was finished in June of the same year. The Quezon family also donated some furnitures and fixtures for the house. The total cost for the relocation was . The Quezon Heritage House, which now functions as a museum was inaugurated also in the same year. With the passing of the Ordinance No. SP-2428 by the Quezon City Council in 2015, the Quezon Heritage House was designated as a Local Heritage Site of Quezon City by the city government. Architecture and design The gate of the house does not strictly follow the Neoclassical style. The Quezon Heritage House was built in Gilmore Street in the 1920s in the Neoclassical style. It had two floors and was painted in beige and white. However the house did not follow strictly the Neoclassical theme and underwent several modifications by the Quezon family in the span of more than 50 years. 60 percent of the original house in Gilmore was used for the reconstruction of the house building now located at the Quezon Memorial Circle. An adjacent rectangular social hall was present in the Quezon house complex. It has round columns and is only a single storey high and features Fu Dog sculptures and two Caryatids as part of the support. Between the social hall and the house building is a rectangular pool which was converted into a fountain when the building was transferred to the Quezon Memorial Circle. The glass doors etched with bamboo with iron-wrought leaves served as the main entrance of the house. This fixture is one of the non-neoclassical features of the heritage house. Features Side view of the facade of the house building. The Quezon Heritage House now serves as a museum focusing on the personal life of former President Manuel Quezon, complementing the nearby Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon at the base of the Quezon Memorial Shrine which focuses on the former president's political career. The main room on the ground floor was used by former First Lady, Aurora Quezon as her office where she was establishing the Philippine Red Cross. Also on the same floor is a room used by Aurora as her age advances as well as a guest room constructed during the time the Quezon-Avance√±as were occupying the house. A kitchen each for the first and second floor is also present. The primary attraction of the museum is the second floor where the two bedrooms of former president Quezon and his wife are situated which is linked by a comfort room. The original beds made from Narra used by the couple is also placed inside the rooms. The couple had separate rooms due to Manuel Quezon's illness. The spiral staircase which was present in the house when it was still in Gilmore was retained upon its relocation to its current place. The cabinets and mirrors, doors, grills and some stained glass panels were also among the original features retained.

Summary A gang of bank robbers fleeing to Mexico invade the home of a frontier family, which unexpectedly turns into a suspenseful night of seduction, turning tables, and revenge. Plot In Cuchillo, New Mexico, 1887, a group of five Outlaws, led by Henry, are robbing the town bank, which culminates in a shoot-out with the residents of the town. A posse of bounty hunters, led by Josiah, is formed and are in hot pursuit, ‚Äúonly being a half-day behind them\\". The outlaws are now down to four after one of the men was shot dead after the robbery. They are met on the path by a couple, who are the aunt and uncle of Charlie, and brought them supplies. They find out that there is a bounty of 8000 dollars on their heads. They shoot the couple so they cannot turn them in for the reward money. The posse comes upon the scene of the dead couple, and Josiah talks to the couples' granddaughter Lulu, who hid in the bushes when her grandparents were shot. She tells them that they are headed East through White Sands, to make them more difficult to track. The outlaws are down to three, when one passes out and they shoot him to put him out of his misery. They spot the Tildon farm, where Preacher George and Ada live with their teenage daughters, Charlotte and Florence, and make plan to descend on them at dark. They burst in to the house, and start eating and drinking whiskey and intend to have relations with the women. Florence catches Henry's eye and he calls her to sit on his lap. Ada and George plead with the men because she is only 15, but both are brutally subdued by Charlie and Little Joe. George says he is the preacher of the chapel on the property, but nobody attends now because the town was ravaged by consumption. Henry orders Little Joe to keep watch outside and take Charlotte with him. Henry wants a massage from Florence and they go into the bedroom. He is put off when she tries to perform oral sex on him, saying she is an \\"adventuress\\". He says he wants to have relations with her, but wants it done the proper way. Little Joe's advances are rebuffed when he tries to talk with Charlotte, who is disgusted with him. Charlie sexually assaults Ada while her husband sleeps next to her on the floor. Florence becomes enamored by Henry and plans to elope with him, to the dismay of her family. Florence pulls a gun on George, but Henry stops her from shooting him. She shoots and kills Charlotte. Henry asks George why Charlotte could not bear children. He lies and says it was because of the fever, but then confesses that he got Charlotte pregnant when she was 11 when he was \\"sick with devil's seed\\" and that a botched abortion was the cause of Charlotte not being able to have kids. George says he stopped a long time ago, but Henry knows he's lying and that he has continued to have relations with his daughters on a weekly basis. Henry orders Little Joe to anally rape George, but calls him off, saying that he just wanted to scare him. Florence comes back in and uses a shot gun to beat George to death so he can feel the pain instead of a quick death. When asked why she killed Charlotte, she says it was because she enjoyed what went on with George. Florence spares Ada and leaves a bag of gold coins and the group leaves. Josiah gets to the farm and finds Ada sitting on the stairs of the chapel, apparently in a catatonic state. He steals the bag of coins, but Ada shoots him to death as he walks away. The group makes it to Mexico and Florence shoots all three men. Charlie dies instantly, but Little Joe is still standing when Henry shoots him to keep him from shooting at Florence. Florence apologizes to Henry, saying she really wanted to go with him, but the reward money was too good to pass up. Henry shoots himself in the head and dies. Florence chops their heads off with an ax and bags them to turn in for the bounty. Back at the farm, Florence shoots Ada.

The petals are bright pink, long and erect with a fringe a further long. The style is long, hairy and curved near the tip. Flowering time is from November to December. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia wonganensis was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from a specimen collected near Wongan Hills and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (wonganensis) is derived from the name of the town, near which the species is found. George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. minutiflora and V. fastigiata. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sand in heath and shrubland. It only occurs near Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia wonganensis is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations. Use in horticulture Verticordia wonganensis is usually propagated from cuttings but these are difficult to strike and those that do are difficult to establish in gardens.

At first, the group bounced around different record labels earnings regional hits with tunes such as \\"Cha-Cha Toni\\" and \\"False Alarm\\", but national success initially eluded them. In 1959, however, the Revels charted at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Midnight Stroll\\"‚Äîthe act's only Top 40 hit. History In 1954, West Philadelphia High School students John Kelly (lead vocalist), John Grant, John Jones, Henry Colclugh and Bill Jackson formed the vocal group, originally performing under the moniker the Re-Vels Quartette. Their live appearances made the combo a well-attended attraction in Northern Philadelphia, which enticed Atlas Records in 1955 and Sound Records in the following year to record singles with the group. Credited to the shortened name the Re-Vels, the singles released in the two years included \\"So in Love\\", \\"You Lied to Me\\", and \\"Cha-Cha Toni\\", the latter of which was a big regional hit in Philadelphia and some other eastern cities but never charted nationally. In 1958, the Re-Vels signed with Chess Records and released \\"False Alarm\\", perhaps their most accomplished record thus far. However, success still eluded the group, prompting Chess Records, which was still in the midst of a prosperous string of releases from Chuck Berry and the Moonglows, to cut the Re-Vels from their roster. A small record label established by Harold Nussbaum (also known as Hal Norton) and William Goldstein called Norgolde Records signed the group, now without a hyphen in their moniker. Jackson's self-penned novelty song \\"Dead Man's Stroll\\", paired with \\"Talking to My Heart\\", was selected to be recorded and distributed for the Halloween market in 1959. Author Richard Aquilla described the single as a teen favorite with \\"a spooky sound, replete with midnight tolls and wailing ghosts\\". Released in September 1959, \\"Dead Man's Stroll\\" was played across the United States, leading to an appearance on Dick Clark's American Bandstand at the end of the month. Clark, however, objected to the song's title, forcing the Revels to alter it to \\"Midnight Stroll\\" to avoid losing the much-needed television exposure. The song peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early November and remained on the charts until December 1959. The Revels followed- up \\"Midnight Stroll\\" with \\"Foo Man Choo\\" in 1960, which also attempted to inflict more chills on its listeners. However, the release could not reach the height of popularity as its predecessor and failed to chart. The group released other singles in the 1960s before disbanding in 1964. Jackson, having composed the majority of the Revels' original material, continued in the music industry as a songwriter. He joined Cameo-Parkway Records in 1963 and had a hand in penning the Tymes' hit song \\"So Much in Love\\". In addition, Jackson co-wrote \\"Here She Comes\\", \\"The Magic of Our Summer Love\\", and \\"You Little Trustmaker\\", and produced the group's recordings in 1963 and 1964. In the 1990s, the Revels reformed for doo-wop revival festivals and television programs in Pennsylvania.

He fought against anti-religious sentiment in the Tibetan area and was killed while he travelled to meet with the Dalai Lama. He was beatified ‚Äì on 16 May 1993 ‚Äì after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late priest had been killed \\"in odium fidei\\" ('in hatred of the faith'). Life Maurice Tornay was born in Valais in Switzerland on 31 August 1910 as the seventh of eight children to Jean-Joseph Tornay and Faustina Dossier. Two sisters were Josephine and Anna while a brother of his was Louis. He was baptized on 13 September 1910 and made his First Communion in 1917. His childhood saw signs of deposition to a pious life and one based on doing the work of God. On one particular evening his mother told him and his sister Anna of the life of Agnes of Rome. In 1925 he commenced high school at Saint Maurice and was there until 1931. In his free time he took friends to the chapel where he would read them passages from the works of Francis de Sales and Th√©r√®se of Lisieux's journal. He wrote to a provost to request admittance to the Canons Regular and he was admitted into the novitiate on 25 August 1931. After a team of missionaries left for China in January 1933 he was disappointed that he did not have his chance to go with them. He was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer in January 1934 and had to follow a special diet ‚Äì he would skip this diet while in the missions; this also prompted an operation and a subsequent period of rest. He had recovered enough to make his vows on 8 September 1935. In 1936 he requested once more to be assigned to the missions in China ‚Äì and left alongside Cyrille Lattion (1909‚Äì1997) and Nestor Rouiller ‚Äì and spent a month and a half before arriving in China. In Weixi in Yunnan he completed his theological studies and his studies in local languages. To his brother Louis he sent a letter stating: \\"I will never return\\". He and his three companions also underwent courses with a doctor and a dentist. The path to the priesthood was now open for him and he travelled for over two weeks to Hanoi in Vietnam where he received ordination on 24 April 1938 from Bishop Fran√ßois Chaize; he wrote to his parents: \\"Your son is a priest!\\". He then received the task of teaching seminarians in Houa-Lo-Pa. In March 1945 saw him appointed as the parish priest of Yerkalo in southeast Tibet. He braved the dangers of the Buddhists who were not fond of Christian missionaries or of Christians in general. The local lamas broke into his residence on the morning of 26 January 1946 and confiscated the church while forcing him into exile. He took up brief residence in Pame, China, (with an old drunkard) and learned of the anti-religious situation back in his parish from parishioners who came in through Pame on business. The lamas threatened him with death if he did not break off contact with his old parish while in May 1946 he received a letter from the Governor of Chamado who promised protection and inviting the priest to return to his parish. But on 6 May 1946 he set off though Gun-Akhio stopped him: \\"Stop! You are forbidden to go further\\". He asked the apostolic nuncio Antonio Riberi for his assistance and the latter advised him to meet with the 14th Dalai Lama. He decided that he would travel to Lhasa to seek an audience with the latter to ask him for an edict of tolerance that would protect the regional Christians. On 10 July 1949 he joined a caravan of merchants and undertook the trip that would last two months and he shaved his beard and put on a Tibetan dress to avoid detection though was recognized during a brief stop. He was forced to leave the caravan though managed to rejoin it and said to his companion Doci: \\"We must not be afraid ... We will die for the Christians\\". Four armed lamas burst from the bush in the Tothong forest which prompted the priest to speak with them: \\"Don't shoot! Let's talk!\\" but two shots rang out and Doci was shot dead. More shots killed the priest on 11 August 1949. His remains were buried though transferred in 1985. Beatification The beatification process opened in the two cities of Kangding and Sion in an informative process that opened in 1953 and concluded its business on 31 March 1963 while being titled as a Servant of God at the onset of the process. His spiritual writings received the approval of theologians on 5 January 1965 while an apostolic process was later held; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated these processes on 27 April 1990. The dossier ‚Äì known as the Positio ‚Äì was submitted to Rome in 1990 for assessment which allowed for theologians to meet on 28 February 1992 to approve the cause while the cardinal and bishop members followed suit on 16 June 1992. Pope John Paul II approved the fact that the slain priest was killed in hatred of his Christian faith which allowed for the pope to preside over his 16 May 1993 beatification. The current postulator of the cause is the Rev. Emilio Dunoyer.

The FRES Utility Vehicle (UV) was that specific programme to create armoured personnel carriers to replace vehicles such as the FV432 and CVR(T) variants such as the Spartan. The winning design provisionally selected for the FRES Utility Vehicle contract was the Piranha V, manufactured by General Dynamics.Ministry of Defence  Defence News  Design selected for future armoured vehicle for British Army (FRES) However, no production order was announced, and the programmes was later restructured and then failed to restart. FRES was cancelled and split into two vehicle programmes: SCOUT which would later be the Ajax (Scout SV) and the Utility Vehicle. Army 2020 plan After the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, then Lieutenant General Nick Carter formed the Army 2020 concept to shape the British Army. That plan envisioned three \\"Armoured Infantry Brigades\\" each with a Heavy Protected Mobility battalion. This unit would have Mastiff vehicles and later, \\"Utility Vehicle[s]\\" or UV, the concept from FRES UV. Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) The UV programme later transformed into the MIV programme. In September 2015, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nick Carter mentioned to reporters that the British Army wished to revive the UV through a MIV programme. This was further confirmed in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review fact sheets. The MIV vehicles, along with the Ajax (Scout SV) vehicles, will form two new Strike Brigades. Design and characteristics Several news articles had speculated that it might be based on the design of the French VBCI infantry fighting vehicle. In February 2014, France agreed to lend a few VBCIs to the British Army for testing. French military sources also reported that the British Army is interested in purchasing the vehicle.British Army could have been interested to purchase Nexter VBCI 8x8 armoured infantry fighting vehicle - Armyrecognition.com, 2 February 2014 General Dynamics Land Systems also offered a model while ST Kinetics offered its Terrex as a variant. The Boxer and Patria AMV X were favourites, as well. On 31 March 2018 the British Army rejoined the Boxer programme. The Boxer is an eight-wheeled multirole vehicle, consisting of two key elements: the platform/drive-line and the removable mission module. The mission module is a key feature of Boxer, it allowing the vehicle to be rapidly changed to meet different operational requirements. Mission modules are attached by four points and can be swapped within an hour under field conditions.

The area which had several palaces was thus named \\"Kottarakkara.\\" Kathakali traced its origin to the ritualistic (tantric) period of the Vedic Age and connected its growth from the popular, folk dance dramas. It was believed that Kathakali was conceived from Krishnanattam, the dance drama on the life and activities of Lord Krishna created by the Samoothirippadu (Samoothiri, Swamy Thirumulpad or Zamorin) of Calicut. The legend is as follows: Once Kottarakkara Thampuran the Raja of Kottarakkara who was attracted by the tone of the Krishnanattam requested the Samoothirippadu for the loan of a troupe of performers on the eve of some festive occasion. Due to internal feuds and political rivalry between them, the Samoothirippadu refused to send the performers and insulted with the remarks: \\"It is useless to depute the troupe, because Kottarakkara Thespian‚Äôs court would be neither able to appreciate nor understand anything of the highly artistic Krishnanattam and the high standard of the performance\\". Here the political rivalry between the two chieftains leads to the art rivalry. So Kottarakkara Thampuran initiated a parallel mode of entertainment, which he called Ramanattam which was later transformed into Aattakatha, and yet later into Kathakali. While Krishnanattam is based on the stories of Lord Krishna‚Äôs activities, Ramanaattam described the complete story of Lord Raman. Krishnanattam was written in Sanskrit, \\"the language of the Gods\\". Ramanaattam was in Malayalam, the language of the people. The use of Malayalam, the local language (albeit as a mix of Sanskrit and Malayalam, called Manipravalam), has also helped the literature of Kathakali become more understandable for the average audience. By the end of the seventeenth century, the finished product of Ramanaattam was placed before the world under the title Kathakali. History A close-up of a Kathakali artist Historically, the small town was known as the land of palaces of kings in Kerala. Its earliest known palace construction is traced to the 14th century. This is attributed to the dynasty of Ilayidathu (also known as Kunninmel), who established themselves here. During the period 1383‚Äì1444, Chera Udaya Marthanda Verma ruled over Venad and built his palace here. It was then the capital of the Ilayidathu Swarupam (also spelled Elayadutharai Swarupam), which is testified by the remnants of seven palaces. In the 17th century, history also records the emergence of an early format of the famous Kathakali dance drama known as Ramanattam, which emerged as a result of the rivalry of the kings of the two neighbouring principalities of the Raja of Kottarakkara and that of the Manaveda, Zamorin of Kozhikode (the Raja of Kozhikode, then known as Calicut, who had developed the Krishnattam (an eighty-day dance drama format). Manaveda refused the request of the Prince of Kottarakkara to send the Krisnaattam troupe to Kottakkara with a snide remark that \\"no connoisseur at Kottarakkara could appreciate Krishnaattam\\". Prince Tampuran felt insulted and then decided to take it a challenge and invented his own form of the dance form which was called the Ramanattam with the Rama theme developed in the Krishnaattam style. Thus, Kottarakkara town got the distinction of being the first in Kerala from where the famous Indian classical dance form originated when it was the capital of the Elayadathu Swarupam, the principality in central Kerala, which was a branch of the Travanacore royal family. He adopted eight stories into creating into dance drama formats which were known as Ramanattam, meaning dance related to Rama (of the Hindu epic Ramayana fame), which were precursors to the Kathakalli which developed in later years with amalgamation with other formats of Krishnattam and early forms of Kathakalii; however only three formats of this creation are performed now as part of Kathakalli. Four more dance drama episodes of Kathakalli plays developed 200 years later, after Ramanattam. In 1739, the Dutch and allied forces had attacked the Travancore forces who were backed by the British at Kottarakkara. The Dutch then installed the princess of Elayadathu Swarupam, who had escaped earlier from Kottarakkara to Tekkumkur as the ruler of the state. In return, the princess had gifted to the Dutch a large farm about 15 miles from Kollam and also at Bichnor where they established their \\"redoubt\\". Followed by this victory, on 30 December 1739 the armed forces than attacked the Travancore and won many battles. However, in the 18th century, the last queen of this dynasty surrendered her kingdom to Marthanda Varma (her cousin), following which the queen went to Cochin where she sought asylum from the Dutch. The Dutch had provided her a pension of 2 rupees and 5 annas. After Tipu Sultan invaded Malabar, Dharma Raja the royal family member of North Malabar settled in Kottarakara. In the mid 19th century, the family line disintegrated. In 1835, it became part of the administrative unit of Kollam as part of the Travancore state which had two revenue divisions, the Kottayam and the Kollam. In 1949, it became part of the integrated state of Travancore and Cochin. The town Village, Block and Jilla and, of course, the state and central governments.

Franchi became a noted preacher and evangelist who was also known for his holiness and his deep commitment to the poor of his diocese. The confirmation of the late bishop's 'cultus' (or popular devotion) allowed for Pope Benedict XV to confirm Franchi's beatification on 21 November 1921. Life Andrea Franchi was born in Pistoia in 1335 as the third of four children that included Francesco di Franco di Simone Franchi as well as Bartolomeo - an advisor of Pope Urban VI and Pope Boniface IX - and the Luca (who joined Franchi in the order). Franchi studied at the Dominican convent of Santa Maria Novella in Pistoia and joined the Dominicans at the age of fourteen in 1359. He was later ordained to the priesthood and became a noted preacher and evangelist. He also served as a teacher in Rome of both philosophical and theological studies. Franchi served from 1369 until 1381 as the prior of the Dominican houses in his home of Pistoia as well as Lucca and Orvieto. Franchi became the Bishop of Pistoia in 1382 after Pope Urban VI appointed him to that position; the new bishop received his episcopal consecration sometime in 1382. He administered to the poor and to the ill and gained the moniker of the \\"Father of the Poor\\". But ill health forced him to - on 29 May 1400  relinquish his episcopal see and he returned to his Pistoia convent where he remained for the final months of his life. Franchi died in 1401. He was interred in the church of San Domenico in Pistoia and his remains were deemed to be incorrupt after their exhumation in 1613 - a sweet odor was said to have emanated from his remains following the exhumation. Beatification Franchi received formal beatification from Pope Benedict XV on 21 November 1921 after the pontiff confirmed the late bishop's 'cultus' (or popular devotion and following).

In the foreground grapes (referring to the wine of the Eucharist) and an apple (symbol of the Fall of Man) lie on a banister. There are several known versions of this painting, made popular by a 1628 painting by Willem van Haecht of the Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest. That Madonna of the Cherries painting was the subject of an anecdote about it which was published in 1648 by Frans Fickaert (1614-1654) in which he stated that on 23 August 1615 while on a visit, the Archduke attempted to buy it from Van der Geest but was refused.Metamorphosis ofte Wonderbaere Veranderingh ende Leven van den vermaerden Mr. Quinten Matsijs, Constigh Grof-smit ende Schilder binnen Antwerpen, t' Antwerpen by Franchoys Fickaert, onder onze Lieve Vrouwen Thoren, in den gulden Enghel, teghenover den Bornput van denselven Quintijn ghemaeckt, anno 1648, met portret van Quinten Matsijs. He claimed it was in the possession of Van der Geest who declined an offer to purchase it by Albert of Austria. Recent dendrochronology has shown that the wood of the panel was felled at the latest in 1502. Though this panel could have been ready for use by 1513, a date after 1527 is more likely. Fickaert may have been mistaken in the year, or possibly this panel is not the original and was copied by the artist based on the story, or perhaps even because of its featured status in the Haecht painting and the enthusiasm Van der Geest had for Matsys. Van der Geest celebrated the hundredth anniversary of Matsys' death by having his bones re-interred in the Antwerp Cathedral with the inscription Connubial bliss turned a blacksmith into Apelles.Love in the Kunstkamer, by Gary Schwartz, Fine Arts Magazine Tableau, Summer 1996 Provenance Detail of the Van Haecht painting featuring the Madonna of the Cherries, with Van der Geest pointing to the Madonna and looking at the viewer and Albert and Isabella seated before it This painting was in the collection of Albertina Agnes (1634-1696), Princess of Oranje-Nassau, at the Frisian Stadholder‚Äôs Court, Leeuwarden, and a century later was appropriated for the national collection from Paleis Het Loo to the museum then in The Hague, 18 September 1798. The appropriation of art from the stadtholder's collection was a tactical move to prevent the abduction of more national treasure to Paris as had happened with the Gallery Prince William V in 1795. The painting has been in the national collection owned by the Rijksmuseum ever since. Since 1948 it has been on loan to the Mauritshuis.

The series was written by Lynda La Plante - her first writing contribution for the BBC, after being poached by the BBC following the success of Prime Suspect. The series focuses on Frank Dillon (Jason Issacs), a former Army soldier who finds life outside the army tougher than being in it - and slowly falls under the power of east end gangster Barry Newman (Peter O'Toole), who is looking to hire a trained hitman. The complete series was released on DVD on 3 June 2013 on Acorn Media UK. Plot Reconciling the danger and excitement of serving in the elite British Parachute Regiment with life back home with his family does not prove simple for Frank Dillon (Jason Isaacs). An impulsive and aggressive man, he is aware that his pay-off from the army isn't sufficient to secure his future but, like his friends, struggles to find stable employment elsewhere. With no one prepared to take a chance on him, Frank may be powerless to resist the approaches of Barry Newman (Peter O'Toole), an East End gangster who could certainly find a use for a trained killer.

It resulted in a ceasefire between the two parties that was intended to last until a permanent peace treaty could be signed (the 1797 Treaty of Tolentino). The terms of the armistice included the payment of 15 million livres in cash in addition to goods and works of art to the French and significant territorial reductions. A temporary Austrian victory against the French at the Siege of Mantua persuaded Pope Pius VI to renounce the armistice in September 1796. The French subsequently invaded the Papal States and enforced the terms of the armistice.  Background  The French Army under Napoleon had been victorious in its campaigns against Austria in Northern Italy and had captured the papal territories of Bologna and Ferrara. Pope Pius VI, seeing no alternative, dispatched Jos√© Nicol√°s de Azara ‚Äì the Spanish resident minister in Rome ‚Äì to Napoleon to negotiate a ceasefire. Azara, who received full plenipotentiary powers from Pius VI, had previously dealt with Napoleon during negotiations held in Milan. The French government was represented by Antoine Christophe Saliceti and Pierre-Anselm Garrau. These ministers had been ordered to take the lead in negotiations by the French Directory and were disliked by Napoleon who believed he would receive better terms without their involvement. Napoleon desired 25 million livres in cash, 5 million livres of goods and 300 works of art from the Pope.  Terms of the treaty  The treaty was signed by Napoleon on 23 June, after his arrival at Bologna with his army, and though still harsh, fell short of his original demands. The papacy agreed to pay France 15 million livres in cash, 5.5 million livres in goods, as well as 100 works of art and 500 manuscripts of France's choosing. In addition Pius VI had to consent to entering negotiations for a full peace treaty (which became the 1797 Treaty of Tolentino), provide a pension to the family of Nicolas Jean Hugon de Bassville (a French representative who was murdered in Rome in 1793), cede Bologna, Ferrara, and the citadel of Ancona to France, and release all political prisoners. Additionally he was to end his calls for a crusade against France and his demands for the reinstatement of the clergy, who had been removed during the French Revolution. The port of Rome was to open trade with French vessels and refuse entry to other foreign ships. The terms were harsh upon the Papal States and threatened the states' financial wellbeing. It fell short of some of the directory's original demands which included the abolition of the papacy, establishment of a republic in Rome and the rescinding of Papal bulls issued since 1789 that criticised the French Republic. Pius did, however, consent to issuing instructions that all French Catholics were to support the republican government. The French installed Fran√ßois Cacault as their minister in Rome with a remit to ensure that the terms of the armistice were complied with.  Renunciation  The unexpected success of Austrian General Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's forces during the first relief of the Siege of Mantua in August led Pius to renounce the treaty in September. The Pope halted the shipment of the remaining 16 million livres of tribute that was bound for Bologna and resumed control of Ferrara. However the French soon regained the initiative, defeating the Austrians, invading the remaining Papal States and enforcing a resumption of the armistice terms. The subsequent February 1797 Treaty of Tolentino imposed still harsher terms on the Papal States, including further cash payments.

She was also a political leader, leading a regional branch of the communist movement in the 1970s as well as the pro-independence nationalist leftist coalition, the Castilian Left, from 2002 to her death in 2016. Early life Benegas was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1951. Her father was Jos√© Mar√≠a Benegas Echeverr√≠a, an exiled Basque Nationalist politician, who fled Spain in 1939 following the victory of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Her mother was Doris Haddad, a Lebanese- Jewish woman who migrated from Lebanon to Venezuela. In 1956 the family moved back to Echeverr√≠a's home region, the Basque Country. In 1964, she left home to attend high school in Bayonne, in French Basque Country, returning to Spain in 1969 to begin studying law at the University of the Basque Country in San Sebastian. In 1972, Benegas moved to Valladolid and started working in the FASA-Renault car factory. There she participated in workers' strikes and industrial action, and subsequently lost her job for her involvement in these activities. She also joined the communist movement and as a result came under police surveillance. In May 1973, she was arrested for her political activism. Benegas completed her law degree and joined the Bar in Valladolid in 1975. Career Legal career Once qualified, Benegas opened a law office in Valladolid. Her legal work was mainly in criminal law, and in cases concerning gender violence, abortion, drug trafficking and defending leftist political activists. She also defended victims of the colza oil intoxication. She represented the families of people shot during Franco's regime, and she was in favour of Basque independence and actively supported Basque ETA prisoners. She was also well known for her commitment to women's social causes - in 1993, she co-founded the Association of Women Lawyers of Valladolid, and in 1994 the Association of Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault and Child Abuse. She also founded the Association of Women Jurists and the feminist collective Women of Valladolid. In 1996, she spoke at the 10th Congress of Women Lawyers on the subject \\"The new criminal code and protection of the rights of women\\". In later years, she was associated with organisations assisting the terminally ill and people who were evicted. Her work for the latter cause was through the Valladolid branch of the organisation Stop Desahucios (\\"Stop Evictions\\"). Political activity After completing her law studies, Benegas became the leader of the Communist Movement in Castile and Le√≥n. In 1976, she worked with others to organise a public commemoration of Castile and Le√≥n Day, a day which celebrates Castilian nationalism. About 400 people gathered at the village of Villalar de los Comuneros, and were violently dispersed by the Guardia Civil. The following year almost 20,000 people attended commemorations. In 1983, she was a key figure in the formation of the Castilian Popular Unity party. In 2000, this party merged with others to become the Castilian Left party, and Benegas was its leader from 2002 until her death in 2016. Benegas was a candidate for Mayor of Valladolid twice, in 1979 and 1983, representing the Unidad Popular-People's Revolutionary Party. In 2012, Benegas was arrested on suspicion of organising an anti-government demonstration, Rodea el Congreso (Surround the Congress). In September 2014, she and Luis Campo sued the government delegate in Madrid, Cristina Cifuentes, and the Director General of Police, Ignacio Cosid√≥, for banning the display of republican symbols during King Philip VI's proclamation. The following month, Benegas, Campo and another protester were arrested at an anti-monarchy demonstration in Madrid and held in custody for 24 hours. Benegas claimed that they were arrested and detained in retaliation for the complaint filed against Cifuentes and Cosid√≥. Family Her brother Txiki Benegas was elected for several terms to represent Basque circumscriptions at the Spanish Cortes in the lists of the Basque branch of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party. However their relation was broken before the 1978 democratization. While Txiki was in ETA's target list, she defended ETA prisoners.DORIS, EL CISMA FAMILIAR DE LOS BENEGAS, Javier G√≥mez, El Mundo - Cr√≥nica, 17 May 2009.

Description  The site consists of a large two level cave with the entrance on the upper level of the western face of an Eifelian limestone cliff and a large terrace which forms a rock shelter of width and depth. Archaeology  Excavations of the cave entrance were first conducted in 1887 and 1902 but the evidence recovered from these is lost. There is lithic and paleontological material from a 1905 excavation but as these were found in reworked sediments from the earlier excavations the context has been lost.St√©phane Pirson, Damien Flas, Gr√©gory Abrams, Dominique Bonjean, Mona Court-Picon, K√©vin Di Modica, Christelle Draily, Freddy Damblon, Paul Haesaerts, Rebecca Miller, H√©l√®ne Rougier, Michel Toussaint, Patrick Semal, \\"Chronostratigraphic context of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition: Recent data from Belgium\\", Quaternary International 259:78-94 ¬∑ May 2012, pp.78-94 In a series of excavations between 1984 and 1985 Palaeolithic stone artifacts and Pleistocene faunal remains were uncovered.

Associated with the material was a partial human molar. At the time it was found scientists were unable to determine whether it was Homo sapiens or Neanderthal. A 2009 study was able to identify it as belonging to a Neanderthal child. The soil of the layer where the tooth was found has been estimated to be between 42,000 and 40,000 years old which the authors state \\"is consistent with both a recently obtained accelerator mass spectrometry dating result at 44,500 BP and the published conventional date.\\" The AMS date is that of a horse tooth found in the same layer.Toussaint M, Olejniczak AJ, El Zaatari S, Cattelain P, Flas D, Letourneux C, Pirson S., \\"The Neandertal lower right deciduous second molar from Trou de l'Ab√Æme at Couvin, Belgium\\", Journal of Human Evolution, 2010 Jan;58(1):56-67. doi: 10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.09.006. The 1905 artifacts have been associated with a variety of prehistoric cultures, such as Solutrean, Mousterian, Proto- Solutrean and a transitional culture in between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic.

On June 29, 2020, Reddit banned the subreddit for frequent rule-breaking, for antagonizing the company and other communities, and for failing to \\"meet our most basic expectations.\\" After the subreddit was quarantined and placed in restricted mode in early 2020, moderators of r/The_Donald created and moved to the site thedonald.win. Many users from the subreddit then flocked to it after the site was opened to the public in the final months of the subreddit.  History  On June 27, 2015, shortly after Donald Trump announced his campaign for the presidency at Trump Tower, the subreddit was created as a place for \\"following the news related to Donald Trump during his presidential run.\\" The subreddit grew to be known for frequent posting of memes, especially Pepe the Frog, and frequent uses of slang terms such as \\"centipede\\" (a reference to a much distributed Trump highlight reel featuring the Knife Party song \\"Centipede\\"), \\"MAGA,\\" \\"nimble navigator,\\" \\"no brakes,\\" \\"cuck,\\" \\"4D chess,\\" and \\"SJW.\\" Furthermore, users on the site referred to Trump as \\"God Emperor\\". For a period of time, the subreddit repeatedly posted an image of Hillary Clinton kissing Robert Byrd, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. The image was accompanied by a photoshopped picture of an aged Byrd in Klan garb, which was meant to dishonestly portray Clinton and Byrd as Klan supporters. Byrd had severed ties with the Ku Klux Klan in 1952. On June 12, 2016, the day of the Orlando nightclub shooting, moderators of the r/news subreddit began to remove many comments from its megathread pertaining to the shooting, leading to accusations of censorship. On that day, r/The_Donald was featured in 13 of the top 25 posts on r/all, and gained over 16,000 subscribers during the weekend of the shooting. Meanwhile, r/news lost more than 85,000 subscribers. Due to deliberate manipulation by the forum's moderators and active users, the algorithm that dictated what content reached the r/all page of Reddit resulted in a significant portion of the page being r/The_Donald content. In response, Reddit administrators made changes to its algorithms on June 15, 2016, in an attempt to preserve the variety of r/all. In April 2016, jcm267, the founder of the subreddit, attributed the popularity of the subreddit to moderator CisWhiteMaelstrom. jcm267 told MSNBC that CisWhiteMaelstrom told him \\"we'd have hundreds of thousands of readers there and I was very skeptical about that, not because I thought Trump can't win, because I think he's the only GOPer with 'landslide victory' potential, but because Reddit is not a conservative place.\\" Subsequently, CisWhiteMaelstrom deleted his Reddit account. In November 2016, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman reported that the subreddit's moderator team had changed \\"at least four times\\" due to the community revolting. The subreddit has hosted \\"Ask Me Anythings\\" (AMAs) of notable right-wing, conservative figures supportive of Trump including Scott Adams, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Helmut Norpoth, Curt Schilling, Peter Schweizer, Roger Stone, Milo Yiannopoulos, Tucker Carlson, and Corey Stewart. Furthermore, Trump himself hosted an AMA on the subreddit on July 27, 2016, which became one of r/The_Donald's most upvoted posts. In September 2016, Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, introduced a 501(c)(4) organization on r/The_Donald called \\"Nimble America\\" with the stated purpose of creating and spreading pro- Trump Internet memes through \\"Facebook ads, billboards, and 'website ops.'\\" Luckey stated that he had donated $10,000 to the organization and offered to match contributions from r/The_Donald users for 48 hours after the announcement. Luckey later apologized for any negative impact his actions had on public perception of Oculus, and stated that he acted independently, not as a representative of Oculus VR. The subreddit was also noted for investigating Clinton's leaked emails after their release by WikiLeaks. Their findings were subsequently reported by right-wing news media while WikiLeaks acknowledged the subreddit in a tweet. The subreddit also coordinated to vote on many online polls during the 2016 presidential debates. The subreddit frequently attempted to manipulate Amazon.com's booklist via vote brigading, or encouraging subscribers to cast a certain review en masse. In November 2016, the subreddit was reportedly mobilizing readers to leave one-star reviews on Amazon.com for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's autobiography, Settle for More, in response to what users considered biased reporting from her. Amazon later removed many of the negative reviews. Later, in September 2017, the subreddit attempted to buy copies of Trump's Great Again: How To Fix Our Crippled America to outsell Hillary Clinton's then-upcoming book What Happened. However, their plan backfired when several users bought other Trump books instead such as Trump: The Art of the Deal while Clinton's book reached #1 on the site. The subreddit also spread a rumor that Clinton's book was actually the bestselling \\"contemporary women fiction\\" book. On November 22, 2016, the moderators of r/The_Donald announced that they were going to start removing posts about some conspiracy theories, such as the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory and a rumor that Julian Assange had disappeared, citing that such content was \\"drowning out thoughtful discussion or Trump-related content.\\" The next day, Steve Huffman admitted to editing the comments of r/The_Donald users by replacing his username (u/spez) within their comments insulting him with the usernames of r/The_Donald moderators instead. Huffman said of the change that \\"I had my fun with them, they had their fun with me, but we are not going to tolerate harassment for any others.\\" One week later, Huffman apologized for his actions, and offered a filter feature to the website, allowing users to exclude subreddits from their r/all page. Starting in February 2017, the subreddit was notably excluded from Reddit's updated homepage, r/popular, along with other \\"narrowly-focused politically-related subreddits.\\" In the beginning of January 2017, after BuzzFeed published a 35-page document alleged to be a dossier of controversial but unverified information about then‚Äìpresident-elect Trump, members of the subreddit stated that the document was \\"fan fiction\\" sent to Republican political strategist Rick Wilson by members of the 4chan forum /pol/. On January 11, 2017, Wilson denied the claims. Later that day, Republican senator John McCain confirmed that he had sent the dossier to FBI director James Comey several months earlier. On May 18, 2017, a moderator named OhSnapYouGotServed posted a message claiming that the subreddit has been treated unfairly and that Reddit could not exist without r/The_Donald. OhSnapYouGotServed also suggested that all of their subscribers should move to Voat. The next day, after three other moderators were banned from the site, the subreddit was temporarily set to \\"private\\" in a sign of protest. According to the lock message, the admins did not warn the three moderators before banning them. The moderators stated that they \\"refused to comply by a special set of rules that were solely imposed on this subreddit to marginalize the only community which doesn't conform to the echo chamber of Reddit and corporate media.\\" The subreddit was made public again the next day. In July 2017, it was discovered that a congressional staffer for Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL) asked for users on r/The_Donald to crowdsource information for a congressional amendment that would look into alleged misconduct on the parts of Hillary Clinton and James Comey. Gaetz confirmed the user was a staffer in an interview with Wired, stating that \\"it is the responsibility of our staff to gather as much information as possible when researching a subject and provide that information for consideration. We pride ourselves on seeking as much citizen input as possible.\\" On August 5, 2017, a post encouraging users to attend the Unite the Right rally, a white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia, was stickied by r/The_Donald's moderators. The post was deleted some time on August 13, 2017, a day after the rally ended in the first-degree murder of counter- protester Heather Heyer and the injury of 19 others by white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. Members of the subreddit maintained a Discord server called \\"Centipede Central\\", which peaked at 16,000 active users and was among the largest servers on Discord. The server was criticized for leaking personal information of anti-Trump activists, which caused The_Donald to sever ties with the group. The server was eventually shut down in a coup in October 2017, which scattered its members to smaller communities. In January 2018, former Senior Counselor Steve Bannon's statements regarding Trump were published in Michael Wolff's \\"Fire and Fury\\". After Trump himself criticized Bannon's comments, many individuals on the subreddit turned against Bannon. The negative comments were subsequently covered by Vanity Fair and Independent Journal Review. After the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, users of r/The_Donald posted messages to the subreddit that justified the shooting and violence against Muslims. When asked for comment, a Reddit spokesperson stated that Reddit had strengthened its hate speech and violence policies over the last several years. When asked about users from r/The_Donald posting in the r/newzealand subreddit after the attack, the moderators of r/newzealand noted that the users often employ dog-whistle verbiage, making it difficult to discern which content posted should have action taken against it.  Quarantine, restriction, and ban  On June 26, 2019, the subreddit was quarantined by Reddit admins due to excessive reports, threatening public figures associated with the 2019 Oregon Senate Republican walkouts, and an over-reliance on the site admins to personally moderate the subreddit. The quarantine added a warning portal, removed revenue opportunities, removed the subreddit from feeds and search, and removed custom CSS styling. In November 2019, the subreddit's moderators attempted to evade Reddit's imposed quarantine by reviving and promoting a subreddit called r/Mr_Trump. This subreddit was banned by Reddit's administrators in accordance with its policy that \\"attempting to evade bans or other restrictions imposed on communities is not allowed on Reddit.\\" Days later, Reddit's admins warned the subreddit's moderators about trying to out the alleged White House whistleblower in the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal in violation of Reddit's rules on harassment and inviting vigilantism. On February 26, 2020, Reddit administrators removed a number of r/The_Donald moderators \\"that were approving, stickying, and generally supporting content in this subreddit that breaks [Reddit's] content policy\\" and called the remaining moderators to choose new ones from a list of Reddit-approved individuals. About the same time, Reddit placed r/The_Donald in \\"Restricted mode\\", removing the ability to create new posts from most of its users. Since then, some users of the subreddit had moved to theDonald.win, a separate site based on Reddit's old user interface. On June 29, 2020, in a flurry of bans, Reddit banned r/The_Donald, along with 2,000 other subreddits (such as r/ChapoTrapHouse, a leftist subreddit based on the podcast of the same name, and r/GenderCritical) deemed to be against their policies. r/The_Donald was largely inactive by the time it had closed due to many users flocking to a new site, theDonald.win.  TheDonald.win  TheDonald.win is an independent far-right internet forum created as a successor to r/The_Donald, similarly based around support of U.S. president Donald Trump. The website has been labeled \\"a magnet for extreme discourse\\" by the Financial Times. It has also been likened to Gab and 8kun, insomuch as it was created in response to \\"pressure from mainstream sites to adhere to content policies around hate speech\\". The website was created on November 21, 2019, by moderators of r/The_Donald. After Reddit quarantined r/The_Donald, moderators of the subreddit promoted TheDonald.win through the use of sticky posts, touting the site as a backup to the subreddit in the event that it was banned. The promotion caused the site to rapidly gain users. Another surge of users was caused on June 29, 2020, when the subreddit was banned by Reddit in a purge of around 2000 communities. As of August 11, 2020, TheDonald.win ranks as the 1,195th most visited website in the United States and 6,474th worldwide, according to Alexa Internet.  Relationship to Trump  The Trump campaign's digital director, Brad Parscale, stated in June 2016 that he visited the subreddit daily. Throughout the election, members in Trump's war room at Trump Tower monitored the subreddit to see new trends. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 27, 2016, Trump hosted an AMA on the subreddit. Moderators of the subreddit stated that they banned more than 2,000 accounts during Trump's AMA session. Trump also posted several pre-debate messages on the subreddit. Throughout Trump's 2016 campaign, as well as the beginning of Trump's presidency, journalists noted that several of Trump's tweets contained images that originally appeared on the subreddit. On July 6, 2016, in response to his deleted tweet containing the Star of David, Trump accused Disney of antisemitism on Twitter, which was accompanied with a photo of a sticker book based on the Disney film Frozen. Justin Miller of The Daily Beast noted that the image Trump used in his tweet originated on the subreddit less than 24 hours before. Similarly, on March 3, 2017, Trump tweeted an image of Chuck Schumer posing with Vladimir Putin to allege hypocrisy. According to BuzzFeed, the image was posted less than 24 hours earlier on the subreddit. On May 11, 2017, after firing James Comey, Trump responded to Rosie O'Donnell's 2016 tweet calling Comey to be fired with \\"We finally agree on something Rosie.\\" Brandon Wall, a reporter for Buzzfeed, alleged that Trump browsed r/The_Donald because O'Donnell's tweet was posted on the subreddit 20 minutes before Trump's response. Although The Washington Post acknowledged that Trump tweeted images previously viral on the subreddit, they also noted that O'Donnell's tweet did not go viral until Trump responded. In July 2017, a video tweeted out by Trump was noted to have appeared on the subreddit about four days earlier. However, the White House denied that the video directly came from Reddit. In May 2019, Politico reported that Trump's social media manager, Dan Scavino, frequented the subreddit, writing that he \\"has helped craft some of Trump‚Äôs most memorable social media moments.\\"  Influence  A quantitative analysis found that r/The_Donald was an important influencer of news content on Twitter, with the board contributing 2.97% of mainstream news links and 2.72% of alternative news links on Twitter (as a fraction of all links co-appearing on Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan). The researchers concluded that \\"'fringe' communities often succeed in spreading alternative news to mainstream social networks.\\" They also calculated that r/The_Donald hosted 35.37% of URLs from 54 alternative news sites \\"like Infowars\\" on Reddit.  Prominence on Reddit website   Algorithm  Through the use of \\"sticky posts,\\" a moderation function of Reddit that allows selected posts to be artificially placed at the top of a subreddit, the moderators of the forum were \\"gaming\\" the algorithms in order to dominate the content on the r/all page, which is a representation of the most popular content on the website. Additionally, users were often apt to flood the website with waves of identical images or posts, a direct violation of site-wide policies regarding spam. In response, Huffman rolled out a change to the r/all algorithm; he noted that r/The_Donald was among several Reddit communities over the years that \\"attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else.\\" Ongoing problems with members of the subreddit brigading and harassing other subreddits forced Reddit staff to modify the site's software algorithms to limit the offending posts to the subreddit. The Reddit team introduced r/popular to replace r/all, which included most popular subreddits except for The_Donald, and as a result the subreddit could no longer reach the front page. In February 2017, Reddit overhauled their algorithms even further to prevent content from the subreddit (among other communities) from ever being seen by logged out users or people who do not have a Reddit account. In a 2018 study by University College London, r/The_Donald was the most active subreddit when it comes to posting memes. The study explained that \\"Reddit users are more interested in politics-related memes than other type of memes.\\"  Conflict with Reddit management  The subreddit received additional coverage on November 24, 2016, when Huffman admitted to editing r/The_Donald users' comments that were critical of him, in response to harassment by the community. On November 30, 2016, Huffman announced that sticky threads from r/The_Donald would no longer show up on r/all. Huffman's rules were criticized by some Redditors, including both Trump and non-Trump supporters, while others felt the sanctions did not go far enough and called upon Huffman to ban the subreddit entirely. While members of the subreddit claimed they were the victims of censorship, Huffman said the actions were about \\"banning behavior, not ideas.\\" The harassment directed at Huffman by r/The_Donald users led to changes in the manner in which Reddit deals with problematic communities and users. Since being harassed by the community, Huffman stated that Reddit is going to start actively policing problematic users: \\"We're taking a different strategy now. We are focusing more on, like, taking care of the individual users instead of doing it at the community level which was largely our strategy before.\\" In March 2017, users of r/The_Donald accused Reddit of discriminating against them when Reddit's advertising platform portrayed r/The_Donald as having 6,000,000 subscribers instead of the 385,000 displayed on the subreddit live counter available to the public. The Reddit Director of Communications stated that the subscriber discrepancy was a simple labeling error wherein the count for \\"daily unique visitors\\" was mistakenly labeled as \\"subscribers\\" and that the error would be partially fixed by the end of the day. In May 2019, former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao told Mother Jones that the subreddit should be banned for not following the site's rules. However, she also acknowledged that \\"it's hard to take down a subreddit which is driving a lot of traffic.\\"  Controversies   Pizzagate conspiracy theory  A conspiracy theory involving the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria attracted attention on r/The_Donald. Several members of the community created the r/pizzagate subreddit which was subsequently banned by Reddit administrators for breaking site rules regarding sharing personal information of others. In December 2016, the subreddit gained media attention when it linked a knee injury sustained by NBA player Andrew Bogut to the conspiracy theory.  Seth Rich murder conspiracy theories  r/The_Donald devoted a significant number of posts to the murder of Seth Rich. In July 2017, The Economist noted that there had been over 10,000 posts dedicated to the topic. The subreddit promoted the conspiracy theory that his killing was a political assassination. Reddit users attempted to tie the homicide to prior \\"Clinton Body Count\\" conspiracy theories. Several members of the subreddit planned a march on Washington D.C.  CNN wrestling video  On July 2, 2017, Donald Trump tweeted a video of himself wrestling Vince McMahon with the CNN logo superimposed over McMahon's face. Multiple sources, including The New York Times, NBC News, the BBC, and The Washington Post, reported that the clip appeared on the subreddit about four days earlier. However, on July 3, the White House denied that the video directly came from Reddit. Additionally, The Washington Post reported that the Reddit user who posted the video, HanAssholeSolo, also wrote about stabbing Muslims while Vox added that the poster attempted to remove his racist comments, including many that said the word nigger and an image of Jewish CNN employees, each being labeled with a Star of David, in a post titled \\"Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it.\\" Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League referred to the user as an \\"extremist\\" after analyzing his posts. The ADL also identified the user as \\"a parent and a veteran in his 40s living in Tennessee\\" based on the personal information within his post history. Based on the aforementioned posts, Vox reported that some members of the forum have interpreted the tweet as support for their racist beliefs. Eventually, after being identified by CNN's Andrew Kaczynski, the user posted an apology in the subreddit on July 4. Immediately afterwards, his apology was locked and deleted by the subreddit's moderators while the user deleted his Reddit account. CNN was accused by Julian Assange, Jack Posobiec, and Mark Dice of blackmailing the user, while the hashtag, #CNNBlackmail, trended on Twitter. Kaczynski responded by stating that his line was \\"misinterpreted\\" and that the user said that he was not threatened prior to his apology. In response to the controversy, ShadowMan3001, one of the moderators of the subreddit, told Kevin Roose of The New York Times that CNN's intent in possibly releasing the user's identity was \\"a glaring example of their absolute lack of not only journalistic integrity, but basic morality.\\"  Russian propaganda  In February 2018 Inquisitr reported on an analysis that revealed that r/The_Donald had thousands of posts to it that originated from Russian propagandists, making it one of the biggest hubs of Russian-based propaganda on the internet. Soon after, The Daily Beast obtained documents from the Russian-backed online \\"troll farm\\" Internet Research Agency that confirmed that the organization deployed its agitators on subreddits including r/The_Donald and r/HillaryForPrison in the run-up to the 2016 election. In early March 2018 congressional investigators revealed that they plan to question Reddit and Tumblr as part of their investigation into the Russian interference surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Representative Adam Schiff urging Reddit and other major online platforms to make more data available about the extent of Russia's online propaganda efforts. Huffman later admitted that Reddit was aware that the site was a target of Russian propagandists, and users of the website criticized Reddit for concealing Russian activity on the website and for not working fast enough to ban extremist communities. When asked why the r/The_Donald community was not banned from the website, Huffman replied that \\"Banning them probably won't accomplish what you want. However, letting them fall apart from their own dysfunction probably will.\\"  Islamophobia  The slogan \\"Remove Kebab\\" has appeared on r/The_Donald in threads that have calls for violence and open hatred directed toward Muslims. As a meme \\"Remove Kebab\\", based on the music video called \\"Serbia Strong\\" by a group of soldiers celebrating the Bosnian Serb war criminal Radovan Karad≈æiƒá has appeared in over 800 threads on the r/The_Donald. The band's accordion player Novislav ƒêajiƒá, convicted in 1997 of crimes during the Yugoslav wars, features in meme images and is known as \\"Dat Face Soldier\\".  Media reception  The subreddit was criticized by Vice, which stated in an article that the subreddit was \\"authoritarian,\\" \\"racist,\\" \\"misogynistic,\\" \\"homophobic,\\" \\"Islamophobic,\\" and a \\"hypocritical 'free speech' rallying point.\\" The publication Slate described r/The_Donald as a \\"hate speech forum\\" and The Verge has described it as a \\"notoriously fetid troll swamp.\\" According to The New York Times, \\"[m]embers respond to accusations of bigotry with defiant claims of persecution at the hands of critics. It is an article of faith among posters that anti-racists are the real bigots, feminists are the actual sexists, and progressive politics are, in effect, regressive.\\" The subreddit also spread fake news and promoted conspiracy theories such as \\"Pizzagate.\\" In February 2017, Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab analyzed how the subreddit was able to spread fake news throughout similar subreddits and conspiracy sites. The subreddit is also connected to the alt-right while an article by The Washington Post connected the moderators of closely related Trump subreddits to racist subreddits such as \\"r/Quranimals\\" and \\"r/Rapefugees.\\" One moderator banned users for reporting Islamophobia to the subreddit, saying, \\"Jesus Christ people, stop reporting Islamophobia. We don't fucking care about our 'Islamophobia problem' AT ALL!\\" The National Memo noted that \\"moderators have made the occasional attempt to rid r/The_Donald of overt racism and anti- Semitism\\" and The Economist emphasized that the moderators \\"at least try\\" to remove anti-semitism from the subreddit. Meanwhile, Motherboard interviewed a moderator of the subreddit, who said \\"[t]he people from /pol/ who can behave, which is probably most of them, stay. The people who don't behave usually wind up getting banned for rule 3.\\" The New York Times also noted that, in addition to the subreddit's \\"no racism/anti-Semitism\\" policy, the subreddit also warns against \\"dissenters or SJWs\\" posting on there and that \\"concern trolling\\" is also banned. Gizmodo commented that the subreddit \\"revealed how easy the site's ageing algorithm is to game,\\" comparing their actions to the profitability of fake news posted on Facebook. Gizmodo also referred the subreddit as \\"Trump supporters' de facto base of power on Reddit.\\" Politico described the subreddit as \\"a message board that acted as a conduit between 4chan and the mainstream Web.\\" In February 2017, after Kellyanne Conway brought up the false Bowling Green massacre, SFGate noted that the subreddit's response to the incident was \\"varied ‚Äì and rather muted.\\" Some users shared the video uncritically while others thought that the incident was an intentional part of a larger strategy by the Trump administration. Similarly, in May 2017, users on the subreddit began reposting memes pertaining to the murder of Seth Rich that occurred in Washington D.C.. Mashable described the postings as a distraction since the users began posting just hours after \\"The Washington Post broke the news that Trump had divulged classified intelligence to Russian representatives.\\" It was later reported by Gizmodo that, at one point, 20 of the top 26 posts on the subreddit pertained to the Seth Rich murder. In the aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, members of the subreddit initially thought that the suspect in the incident was Muslim and wrote comments about banning Muslims and refugees. However, after the identity of the shooter was revealed, the members saw the shooting as a \\"false flag\\" and posted various conspiracy theories. Using latent semantic analysis, FiveThirtyEight analyzed the relationship between the r/The_Donald and 50,323 other active subreddits based on 1.4 billion comments made over a two-year period from 2015 to 2016, and found the community was related to a number of \\"hate-based subreddits,\\" such as the respectively banned r/fatpeoplehate and r/coontown.

FaaS was initially offered by various start-ups circa 2010, such as PiCloud. AWS Lambda was the first FaaS offering by a large public cloud vendor, followed by Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM/Apache's OpenWhisk (open source) in 2016 and Oracle Cloud Fn (open source) in 2017.  Use cases  Use cases for FaaS are associated with \\"on-demand\\" functionality that enables the supporting infrastructure to be powered down and not incurring charges when not in use. Examples include data processing (e.g., batch processing, stream processing, extract-transform-load (ETL)), Internet of things (IoT) services for Internet-connected devices, mobile applications, and web applications. Another Real-world use case can be, creating API's (Application Programming Interface) for already built application without breaking down or modifying the current or existing functionality of the application. Comparison with PaaS application hosting services Platform as a service (PaaS) application hosting services are similar to FaaS in that they also hide \\"servers\\" from developers. However, such hosting services typically always have at least one server process running that receives external requests. Scaling is achieved by booting up more server processes, which the developer is typically charged directly for. Consequently, scalability remains visible to the developer. By contrast, FaaS does not require any server process constantly being run. While an initial request may take longer to be handled than an application hosting platform (up to several seconds), caching may enable subsequent requests to be handled within milliseconds. As developers only pay for function execution time (and no process idle time), lower costs at higher scalability can be achieved (at the cost of latency).

Following retirement from teaching, van Imschoot was among the early members of the Colloquium Biblicum Lovaniense, an annual meeting of Catholic biblical scholars. He served as the society's president in 1953 and chaired the biblical theology section of the International Catholic Bible Congress, convened in the Vatican pavilion of the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels.Callaham, 3-5.

Despite van Imschoot's notoriety in Catholic circles during his lifetime, the dual influences of systematic theology and Neo-Scholastic Thomism upon his work likely limited its reception within the broader academic field of biblical theology.Callaham, 5-8.

UAP offers education, government advocacy, community redevelopment, and public outreach to support the architecture profession in the country and improve its public image. Its headquarters is located in Quezon City.  History  The United Architects of the Philippines was formed through the merger of three architectural organization in the Philippines in 1975. These were the League of Philippine Architects (LPA), the Association of Philippine Government Architects (APGA), and the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA). Upon its registration on May 19, 1975, it became the first duly-accredited professional organization in the country. After the passage of Republic Act 9266, or the Architecture Act of 2004, UAP applied as the Integrated and Accredited Professional Organization of Architects (IAPOA) to the Professional Regulation Commission on May 19, 2014.  United Architects of the Philippines Student Auxiliary  The United Architects of the Philippines Student Auxiliary (UAPSA) was established in 1989 as the junior partner of UAP. It is the official student organization of UAP and has 94 member schools with over 16,000 members.  Conflict between architects and civil engineers in the Philippines  At the end of World War II in 1945, there were approximately 300 architects and 1,800 civil engineers in the Philippines who were tasked to help rebuild the war-ravaged country. Both professions practiced under one law before June 1950, when Congress passed two laws which distinguished the works of the civil engineers from the architects. Further amendments were made in 1956 to further distinguish the two professions. From 1950s-1970s, civil engineers who desired to practice architecture in the country must take up an architecture degree and pass the licensure examination for architects. On February 1977, President Ferdinand Marcos signed into law PD 1096, the National Building Code of the Philippines; there was nothing stated in Section 302 of the said law about signing architectural documents or which state- regulated professional shall sign and seal such documents. However, in some versions of the implementing rules and regulations of PD 1096, Section 302 appeared to state that civil engineers can sign and seal architectural documents, which is an act of illegal intercalation of or insertion into the text of Section 302. The United Architects of the Philippines, along with a House of Representative member who happens to be an architect, Rupert Gaite, led a massive campaign to fully disseminate public information on the practice of architecture in the Philippines. In 2003, UAP entered an agreement with the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE) to support each other's legislative initiative and to finally fully segregate the two practices of architects and civil engineers. The architects were to give up structural design while the civil engineers will give up architectural design. In 2004, Republic Act No. 9266 (RA 9266) was passed. It was known as the Architecture Act of 2004. It states that the architects shall be the sole professionals with the exclusive privilege to prepare, sign and seal architectural documents. PICE contested the decision and filed a bill in Congress seeking to make civil engineers the prime professional for buildings; some architects contested this filing by actively engaging civil engineers in print media to distinguish the two professional practices. In 2005, the AAIF led the architects in defeating the 2004 bill filed by civil engineers in the Congress. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) published thrice the 2004 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of PD 1096, the 1977 National Building Code, which states that only architects shall sign and seal architectural documents. PICE then sued the Secretary of DPWH over the matter, and UAP intervened with the case, which is now pending in the Supreme Court. In 2007, the newly reconstituted Professional Regulatory Board of Architecture (PRBoA) commenced its active campaign against the perceived illegal practitioners of the architecture profession in the Philippines, including the civil engineers. PICE countered by suing the PRBoA Acting Chair in civil court. The Regional Trial Court of Manila favored with the architects in 2009 in the 2005 case filed by PICE against the DPWH Secretary, with UAP as the intervenor. PRBoA then fled 2 complaints at the Office of the Ombudsman (already consolidated) vs. the DPWH Secretary, 1 Senior DPWH Under Secretary, 1 DPWH Under Secretary, PICE and the publisher of a popular commercial (but intercalated) version of P.D. No. 1096 and its 2004 Revised IRR. In 2010, the PICE again sued the PRBoA Acting Chair at the Office of the Ombudsman, which was already twice dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman. In January 2012, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the PICE in the 2005 case it filed vs. the DPWH Secretary, with the UAP as Intervenor; UAP appealed the decision at the Supreme Court. In 2014 and 2015, Congress started hearing the new bills filed by both the architects and civil engineers. Based on the initial reading of the bills, the architects mainly seek to restore the portions of architectural practice (including limited structural design) lost through past legislation and to define the practice consistent with worldwide practices. The suspended implementation of RA 9266 was deplored by the former President of the Philippine Senate, Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who states that it hampers effort to build public structures that is distinctly Filipino.

He is a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party. Political career On 23 December 2014, the Anbar Provincial Council voted in al-Rawi as the next Governor of the province. 18 out of the 30 members of the council voted for al-Rawi during a meeting held in Baghdad. Previously, on 13 December, the council had voted to make al-Rawi's predecessor, Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi, retire due to injuries he had received. On 24 December, the President of Iraq, Fuad Masum, approved al-Rawi's appointment in a decree, which was announced on 28 December. According to Ayub Nuri, writing for Rudaw, \\"It is said that the people of Anbar support him and he has a genuine following\\" because he \\"has so far remained neutral between the tribes and the government and rather focused on his job as governor.\\" In late February 2015, al-Rawi met with tribal elders from Anbar, led by Sheikh Rafi Abd al-Karim al- Fahdawi, where they stressed that \\"Anbar must not be liberated but by its people\\" rather than by those from outside the province. On 13 August 2015, al- Rawi announced that he was dismissing all of his aides and advisers as part of the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi's reform plans to crack down on corruption within government. Al-Rawi also announced that he was dismissing all the district managers who had been in their jobs for more than four years or performed poorly. Reuters wrote that al-Abadi's \\"reform drive is especially important in Anbar, the Sunni heartland in western Iraq where the Baghdad government is focusing its offensive against Islamic State, which has seized large swathes of the country's north and west including the Anbar capital Ramadi.\\" Al-Rawi also said that future appointments would be made \\"on the basis of experience and competence\\" and \\"according to need and specialization\\". He was removed from his office by the Anbar Provincial Council in June 2016 on charges of misusing powers, negligence, and deliberate delinquency. al-Rawi rejected the decision and demanded a public interrogation. He was dismissed from his position as governor on 29 August by the council after a majority of its members voted to remove him over charges of financial and administrative corruptions. However, he refused to relinquish his position and the dismissal order was revoked by a court on 14 November. In response, the council froze his financial powers the following day. It however revoked his dismissal after the election of its new president on 26 November.

Although he is not mentioned in the Book of Magauran, he had a reputation as a great patron of poets. In 1367 his brother Tadhg Buidhe and another relative, Aengus, died.

History  The exact date of construction of the mosque is unknown. The mosque is dedicated to the flag- bearer (), who fell whilst planting the first Ottoman flag on the walls of Nicosia on the Constanza bastion, on 9 September 1570 during the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. This bastion was later called the Bayraktar bastion during the Ottoman period. The tomb of the fallen flag-bearer lies next to the mosque, but the name of this person remains uncertain. Some sources call him Alemdar Kara Mustafa, some Alemdar Mehmet Aƒüa, while a story amongst Nicosians holds his name as \\"Deli Cafer\\" (\\"Mad Cafer\\"). Archaeologist Tuncer Baƒüƒ±≈ükan has written that the site was turned into a place of religious significance as part of efforts to consolidate Islamic faith in Cyprus. What is known is that there was at first a grave on the site, which was later converted to a tomb and then a masjid without a minaret. A marble inscription dated to 1756/57 on the tomb says that Hasan Agha, the governor of Cyprus, dedicated the tomb to the soul of his deceased mother, but no official records exist to indicate who actually built the tomb. In 1767, Giovanni Mariti, a visitor to Nicosia, recorded there being a masjid with no minaret alongside a tomb. According to an inscription at the entrance of the mosque, a minaret was added, along with a minbar and a mihrab, by Abdullah Pasha in 1820/21, during the reign of Mahmud II, who is known for public improvements in Cyprus. The tomb underwent an extensive, \\"radical\\" renovation in 1909, in which its stones were replaced. Up to 1930, the mosque held a beard that allegedly had belonged to Muhammad. On religious occasions, visitors would kiss the beard three times and then place it to their foreheads. This relic was stolen on 27 November 1930. The mosque was bombed three times during the Cypriot intercommunal violence. The first bombing took place on the night of 24 March 1962 and was at the time blamed on Greek Cypriot EOKA. This provoked Turkish Cypriots to demonstrate throughout the island and escalated the tensions between the two communities. Left-wing Turkish Cypriot journalists Ahmet Muzaffer G√ºrkan and Ayhan Hikmet writing for the local newspaper Cumhuriyet wrote that the bombing was carried out by the Turkish Resistance Organisation on 23 April 1962 and later met with Polycarpos Georgadjis, Greek Cypriot Minister of the Interior. They were assassinated the same day. In 2010, Sabri Yirmibe≈üoƒülu, a retired Turkish general, said that they had bombed a mosque in Cyprus to inflame inter- communal tensions, which was suspected to be the Bayraktar Mosque by Turkish press. The bombing created a hole in the minaret. The mosque was repaired and its reopening took place on 25 December 1962. On 26 January 1963, a second bombing occurred, which severely damaged the minaret. The minaret was reportedly in the danger of collapse. After Bloody Christmas, on 23 January 1964, a third bombing occurred at around 21:00 local time. The minaret was entirely demolished in the explosion. √ñmeriye Mosque was bombed and severely damaged at the same time. Samuel Hardy, a specialist on art theft, lists the destruction of Bayraktar Mosque among ethnically-based incidents of intentional damage to cultural heritage during the Cypriot conflict. In February 1975, when UNESCO officials visited the mosque, they reported it to have been \\"totally vandalised\\", with \\"the minaret pulled down, the windows blocked, the roof in a state of collapse\\". By September 1975, the building had been restored except for the minaret that was being rebuilt. In 1985, the minaret was still under construction. In 1990, the mosque was restored and in 2003 it was opened to worship.  Architecture  The mosque has a rectangular plan along a northwestern-southeastern alignment. The entrance is through a sharp pointed arch above which the inscription detailing the repair is located. The corner near the entrance is divided from the rest of the building to make a tomb, and from the tomb towards the opposite side, another wall is placed to create another room for visits to the tomb. A three-arched narthex is present at the front. The minaret is placed next to the wall of the tomb.

She was portrayed by Katharine Isabelle and serves as the antihero of the films. Appearances Ginger Snaps In Ginger Snaps, Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who are both fascinated with death and, as children, formed a pact to die together. One night, while preparing to steal the dog of Trina Sinclair, Ginger starts her first period, which causes the girls to be attacked by a werewolf. Ginger is wounded, but is rescued by Brigitte. The creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam, who is a local drug dealer. Ginger decides not to go the hospital as her wounds heal quickly. She slowly begins to change causing Brigitte to become worried and desperate to find a cure. After several failed attempts to cure Ginger, Brigitte discovers that a dose of monkshood helps control the infection. Before Brigitte can inject Ginger with the plant, she completely transforms, forcing Brigitte to kill her. Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed In Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed, while only appearing as a minor character, Ginger is seen in several of Brigitte's hallucinations telling her to give in to the transformation. Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning In Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning, Ginger returns as a lead character. In the 1800s, Ginger and Brigitte are lost with their horse in the Canadian wilderness when they discover an \\"abandoned camp\\". An Indian woman gives them each a pendant. Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but a hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. They are led to Fort Bailey. A group of werewolves attack the camp and Ginger is bitten on the shoulder. After being held prisoner and fighting back, Ginger opens the gates and lets the werewolves enter. Ginger and Brigitte are the only ones left alive. When Brigitte states that she is cold, Ginger quotes \\"I'm not\\". Brigitte cuts her hand and presses it against a cut on Ginger's hand, mixing their blood and infecting herself with the curse as well. Development Casting Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived. Reception What Culture said: \\"Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when she's bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over- sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail which she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Ginger's humanity and her animalistic side.\\" Jessica Roakes of The Toast also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying \\"Ginger's body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenant of the body-horror genre ‚Äî the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger's case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous.\\" References External links * Female horror film characters Film characters introduced in 2001 Fictional murderers Fictional werewolves Fictional characters with disfigurements Ginger Snaps characters ","title":"Ginger Fitzgerald"},{"id":"51204069","text":"Mohamed Reza Banna (, born 5 May 1971) is an Iranian former cyclist.

Early life and state football Wills was educated at Scotch College in Melbourne, playing football with the third team in Year 11 and then alternating between the second and first team in Year 12. After graduating, he travelled to London to work at Harrow College. A year later, upon his return from England, Wills joined Old Scotch in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) in 2013. In 2013, he played 5 senior games and 15 reserves games, and in 2014 played 11 senior games and a single reserve game, totalling 32 games played for the club. He was named among the best in six of his senior games in 2014. In 2015, Collingwood's Victorian Football League (VFL) manager, Luke Gatti, invited Wills to trial for their top-up squad. He played six senior games for them before being drafted to their Australian Football League (AFL) side. A series of injuries, including a hamstring injury, sidelined him and prevented him from making any more appearances that season. AFL career Wills was drafted by the Collingwood Football Club with their third selection and sixty- third overall in the 2015 national draft. He made his debut in a nineteen point victory against West Coast in the 19th round of the 2016 season at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, laying 11 tackles. These 11 tackles put him as the VFL/AFL record-holder for most tackles laid in a game on debut. After his debut, he played another four games, totalling five games played in his debut season, in which he averaged 17 disposals and 8.6 tackles per game. In the 2017 season, Wills made only one senior appearance, after suffering a quad muscle injury in the pre-season and a calf muscle injury in April. Despite the lack of games, Wills signed a two-year contract extension at the end of the season. In the 2018 season, Wills didn't feature at all at the senior level. In the 2019 season, Wills made only three appearances in the first half of the season, before resurging with the last four games of the regular season, which were among the best games of his career, averaging 18.8 disposals, 9 contested possessions, and 6.8 tackles.

Former street The original street, which was named after the Earls of Monmouth who owned land here in the 17th century, ran from what is now Charing Cross Road to another former street called Broad Street (now part of St Giles High Street). Throughout the 18th century and for most of the 19th, Monmouth Street was famous for its old clothes shops. Gay wrote in his Trivia: \\"Thames Street gives cheeses, Covent Garden fruits, Moorfields old books, and Monmouth Street old suits.\\" Notable inhabitants in 1751‚Äì55 included the freemasons John Hamilton and John Holland. In the 19th century, Monmouth Street was widened to form the eastern part of Shaftesbury Avenue, and the name disappeared. Current street The current street was originally two separate streets. The part north of Seven Dials was called Great St Andrew's Street and the part south of Seven Dials Little St Andrew's Street. In the 1930s the whole street was renamed Monmouth Street, in an attempt to re-create the original street. The Covent Garden Hotel is situated at no. 10.

Biography  Born in a poor family from Holland, he nevertheless one day discovered a passion for science and the rigorous methods of the Chartists. At eighteen, he became secretary of the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre, then from 1897 to 1912, he held the same position at the Mercure de France. He then devoted to his scholarly work. He also shared with his friend Paul L√©autaud a passion for poetry that will lead them to publish jointly in 1900 their famous anthology Po√®tes d‚Äôaujourd'hui (1880‚Äì1900), reprinted many times. Suffering from a painful disease of syphilitic origin, the tabes dorsalis, he overcame his physical miseries to concentrate on his work. Adolphe was primarily engaged in the critical edition of the satiric, libertine and gallant poets and writers, but also addressed, through a series of regional anthologies, oral folklore of the French provinces, in collaboration with Arnold van Gennep. He also played an important role by the publisher Georges Cr√®s in the collection \\"Ma√Ætres du livre\\" in which he published critical editions of Verlaine, Baudelaire, Ronsard and Rousseau. He helped L√©on Bloy publish Le D√©sesp√©r√© (\\"Despairing\\").√âric Walbecq, ¬´ Les envois de L√©on Bloy sur le D√©sesp√©r√© ¬ª, Histoires Litt√©raires, #1, 2000, (p. 40‚Äì53).

He died prematurely at the age of fifty-five, in his Paris home of , after having published nearly one hundred books.

Biography Emilio Wilhelm Rams√∏e was born in Copenhagen, the second child of five. His father, Emilius Wilhelm Rams√∏e (1807‚Äì1858) was a professional oboe-player; his mother was Anne (n√©e Rasmussen) (1808‚Äì1889). He had four siblings, Kirstine (born 1833), Frederik (born 1840), Louis (born 1843), and Alvilda (born 1846). He was christened in 1837 at Garnison parish. Later the family moved to the area of N√∏rregade in neighborhood of N√∏rre Kvarter in Copenhagen. Career Rams√∏e began playing violin at very young age. At 17 years old, he became conductor at actors guild for traveling theater companies; he conducted concerts in Denmark and Norway. Between 1857 and 1864, he conducted several concerts and performances at the newly built 2,000-seat concert hall Alhambra which opened in 1857. It was during this time that Rams√∏e established his reputation as a conductor and composer; this led to his appointment as music-director at the then popular Folketheateret. From 1864 to 1875 he continued to conduct, while also composing and arranging various comedies. However, after a difference of opinion with the Folketheateret theater director, Michael Wallem Brun (1819‚Äì91), Rams√∏e left the theatre and moved to Stockholm. In approximately 1877, he moved to St Petersburg, first working as a viola player in the Italian opera orchestra, and later at the Bolshoi Theatre with the Russian opera orchestra. In 1887 he was engaged as Royal music director at the Mikhaylovsky Theatre opera and ballet house. He returned annually to Copenhagen for summer vacations and conducted the symphonic wind band of Rosenborg Br√∏ndkuranstalt, which played every morning in Rosenborg park. Marriage and later illness On 5 September 1863, Rams√∏e married Mathilde Marie Strandmann-Petersen (1841‚Äì1891) in Copenhagen. His last years were plagued by bad health; he died in St. Hans Hospital, Roskilde. He was 58 years old.

It is known from Africa through southeast Asia and Oceania to Polynesia. Description The rhizomes are dorsiventral (having upper and lower surfaces clearly distinct in appearance), and bear two rows of stipes, which sometimes have distinct joints where they attach. Distinct phyllopodia are present in some below the joint. The rhizome scales are brown, glabrous, and dull to glossy. Hairs, where present, are unbranched and branched, from whitish to brown in color. The leaf blades range from pinnatifid to pinnate- pinnatifid in cutting, bearing free veins which usually end in hydathodes on the upper surface of the leaf. Sori are borne beneath pinnae or lobes, sometimes slightly sunken into the leaf tissue, usually in two rows but rarely in one. The sori are circular to elliptic in shape; the sporangia lack hairs. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Barbara Parris in 2007 to receive some of the species of the polyphyletic genus Ctenopteris; Ctenopterella is a diminutive form of that name. She initially placed twelve species in the genus. In 2013, she described a new species, Ctenopterella gabonensis, from the Monts Doudou in Gabon, and transferred a Vietnamese species, Ctenopterella nhatrangensis, into the genus. In 2015, she transferred three more species from Ctenopteris, including one she had formerly placed in synonymy, in preparation for a monograph on the genus. The only phylogenetic study so far to include any Ctenopterella species sampled Ctenopterella denticulata only. It found that this species, Acrosorus friderici-et-pauli (the type of its genus), and Grammitis stenophylla form a clade sister to the combined clade of Oreogrammitis, Prosaptia, Radiogrammitis, and Themelium. None of the three taxa in the first clade are particularly close morphologically. Ctenopterella denticulata has since been transferred to the genus Chrysogrammitis as Chrysogrammitis denticulata.

He served as the second Bishop of Algiers from 1846 to 1866. He attempted to convert the Arabs to Catholicism. He denounced socialism, rampant among French colonists, as the devil. Early life Louis-Antoine-Augustin Pavy was born on March 13, 1805. Career Pavy was ordained as a priest in 1829. He served as the second Bishop of Algiers from 1846 to 1866. During his tenure, he was responsible for the construction of Notre Dame d'Afrique in Algiers. Like his predecessor, he attempted to convert the Arabs to Catholicism. His 1850 request to evangelise the Arabs in villages across the Constantine Province was denied by the Minister of War, who feared they would feel disrespected. Undaunted, he gave speeches denouncing Islam from his pulpit in Algiers. Meanwhile, Pavy made sure to cater to the French colonists who lived in Algiers. He was especially fearful of their growing adherence to socialism, which he compared to the devil.

Set on originally associated with it, the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboarded sides, and stone foundation. It is five bays wide and three deep, with its entrance centered on the east- facing facade. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and is topped by a half-round transom window and a broken gabled pediment. There is a keystoned Palladian window directly above the entrance. A 1-1/2 story wood frame ell extends west from the main block, forming what is probably the oldest portion of the house. The interior retains original Federal period fireplace mantels and other features. with The oldest portion of the house, its ell, was built about 1783 by Alvan McKenstry, one of Bethel's leading citizens and owner of the Bethel House Hotel. About 1800-1810, McKenstry hired Joseph Emerson, a local master builder, to build what is now the main block of the house. Its design is based on large part on Plates 31 and 32 of Asher Benjamin's Country Builder's Assistant. The house's location is near what was once considered to be the town center.

He was a son of the better known general Wang Jian. He played a key role in the Qin's wars of unification.http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/personswangben.html  Life  In 225 BCE, a 600,000 strong Qin army led by Wang Ben conquered more than ten cities on the northern border of Chu as a precautionary move to guard the flank from possible attacks from Chu while Qin was invading Wei. Wang Ben then led his forces north to attack and besiege Daliang, the capital of Wei. As Daliang was situated at the concourse of the Sui and Ying rivers and the Hong Canal, its geographical location gave it a natural defensive advantage. Besides, the moat around Daliang was very wide and all the five gates of the city had drawbridges, making it even more difficult for Qin forces to penetrate the city. The Wei troops used the opportunity to strengthen their fortifications and defences. Wang Ben came up with the idea of directing the waters from the Yellow River and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang. Wang Ben's troops worked for three months to redirect the water flow while maintaining the siege on Daliang, and succeeded in their plan. Daliang was heavily flooded and over 100,000 people died, including civilians. King Jia of Wei surrendered and Wei came under Qin's control. Qin established the commanderies of Dang and Sishui in the former Wei territories.http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E7%A7%A6%E7%81%AD%E9%AD%8F%E4%B9%8B%E6%88%98 In 222 BCE he led an army that invaded Liaodong and destroyed the remaining forces of Yan, capturing King Xin, and bringing an end to Yan.http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E7%A7%A6%E7%81%AD%E7%87%95%E4%B9%8B%E6%88%98 In the same year Wang Ben led a Qin army that conquered Dai, and captured King Jia of Dai (the last ruler of the state of Zhao).

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Array are located nearby and these experiments are currently making observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Their goals are to study how the universe began, what it is made of, and how it evolved to its current state. The Simons Observatory shares many of the same goals but aims to take advantage of advances in technology to make far more precise and diverse measurements. In addition, it is envisaged that many aspects of the Simons Observatory (optical designs, detector technologies and so on) will be pathfinders for the future CMB-S4 array. The Simons Observatory has been made possible by a combined $40.1 million grant from the Simons Foundation and a number of participating universities.. The Collaboration is large and multinational with over 250 scientists at over 35 institutions across the world.  Science goals  One of the primary goals of the Simons Observatory are polarization maps of the sky with an order of magnitude better sensitivity than the Planck satellite. These will enable better measure cosmological parameters but the maps will also enable a wide range of other science. Examples include gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects. With delensing the large- angle polarization signal it will be possible to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources. Details have been published in a forecasts Paper.  Frequencies  The CMB peaks at a frequency of 160.3GHz. At and just below this frequency the atmospheric opacity is low. As a result the majority of the Simons Observatory's detectors will operate from 90 to 150GHz. However, critical to sensitive measurements is coverage at other frequencies in order to remove foregrounds such as emission from our galaxy. Since these foregrounds have a different spectrum to the CMB by using higher and lower frequencies it is possible to separate them out. The exact band centers used by the Simons Observatory are 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz.  Telescopes  To achieve a high enough angular resolution for some of the science goals, a telescope with an aperture larger than ~5 meters is needed. To reduce systematic effects which become the dominate source of errors in very low noise maps, the Simons Observatory will build a 6 meter telescope and under illuminate the primary mirror to 5.5 meters. At the same time other science goals require very low noise on large angular scales - something a 6 meter telescope will struggle to achieve. For this reason the Simons observatory will also build three 0.5 meter telescopes and combine the data sets in analysis.  The Large Aperture Telescope (LAT)  The 6 meter diameter telescope has a Crossed Dragone design. At a frequency of 90GHz it has a field-of-view over 7.8 degrees. Currently it is under construction by Vertex Antennentechnik in Germany. This telescope is of an identical design to the higher frequency CCAT-prime telescope which is also under construction. 387x387px The detectors on the LAT will be housed in a single large cryostat over 2.4 meters in diameter. This will house up to 13 optics tubes consisting of three cooled silicon lenses (to refocus light from the secondary focus of the telescope onto the detectors) and a Lyot stop at a image of the primary mirror (to prevent stray light from the telescope structure reaching the detectors). One of these 13 tubes will operate at 27 & 39GHz, four will operate at 93 & 145GHz, two at 225 & 280 GHz and the rest are reserved for future expansion. This cryostat will be one of the largest millimeter-wave astronomical cameras ever built.  The Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs)  The small aperture telescopes are refracting telescopes with 3 aspheric silicon lenses and a rotating half wave plate. Each telescope has a field-of- view of over 35 degrees. Overcoming systematic effects, such as picking up signals from the ground in sidelobes, are critical to the measurement of the very largest angular scales so each telescope has co-moving screens and is mounted inside a fixed ground screen that reflects diffraction from the co- moving screens to the sky. 387x387px  Detectors  The Simons Observatory will use Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers. These devices will be cooled to 100mK inside cryostats using pulse tube coolers to cool to below 4 Kelvin and dilution refrigerators for the final 1K and 100mK cooling stages. Approximately 60,000 bolometers with roughly half on the LAT and the rest on the SATs. To readout the detectors a microwave multiplexing scheme will be used.  Current status  As of November 2019 none of the 4 telescopes are completed or at the site in Chile. However, final designs exist and construction will start shortly. A geological survey of the observatory site has been completed and preparations for installing site infrastructure (power, roads, internet, buildings) have started. The cryostats for all the telescopes have been built and initial thermal tests are being carried out.

With support significantly derived from charismatic authority, Erdoƒüanism has been described as the \\"strongest phenomenon in Turkey since Kemalism\\" and used to enjoy broad support throughout the country until the 2018 Turkish economic crisis which caused a significant decline in Erdoƒüan's popularity. Its ideological roots originate from Turkish conservatism and its most predominant political adherent is the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), a party that Erdoƒüan himself founded in 2001. Overview As a personified version of conservative democracy, key ideals of Erdoƒüanism include a religious inspired strong centralised leadership based primarily on electoral consent and less so on the separation of powers and institutional checks and balances. Critics have often referred to Erdoƒüan's political outlook as authoritarian and as an elective dictatorship. The election-centric outlook of Erdoƒüanism has often been described as an illiberal democracy by foreign leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. Erdoƒüanism is also strongly influenced by the desire to establish a 'New Turkey', departing from the founding Kemalist principles of the Turkish Republic and abolishing key enshrined constitutional ideals that are at odds with Erdoƒüan's vision, such as secularism. Supporters of Erdoƒüanism often call for a revival of cultural and traditional values from the Ottoman Empire and are critical of the pro- western social reforms and modernisation initiated by the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Grassroots support for Erdoƒüanism mainly originates from the development of a cult of personality around Erdoƒüan, as well as the predominance of charismatic authority. The role of Erdoƒüan personified as an individual agent of Turkish conservative values has manifested itself in the form of prominent campaign slogans for the Turkish Presidential election such as \\"Man of the nation\\", translated in Turkish as \\"Milletin Adamƒ±\\". History Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, whose ideals and political agenda have come to be referred to as 'Erdoƒüanism' The term 'Erdoƒüanism' first emerged shortly after Erdoƒüan's 2011 general election victory, where it was predominantly described as the AKP's liberal economic and conservative democratic ideals fused with Erdoƒüan demagoguery and cult of personality. The usage of the term increased in conjunction with a greater recognition of Erdoƒüan on the global stage, mostly due to his proactive foreign policy ideals based on Neo-Ottomanism, a core factor that Erdoƒüanism encompasses. Core values The American news publication Foreign Policy has described Erdoƒüanism as an ideology fundamentally based on a cult of personality forming around Erdoƒüan, referring to it as a form of populist authoritarianism similar to that of Putinism in Russia. Foreign Policy also describes Ottomanism (the glorification of the Ottoman Empire), Islamism, suspicion of western political intervention in the Middle East, the rejection of Kemalism, and confinement of the democratic process and elections as key attributes of Erdoƒüanism. Conflict with Islamism Though elements of Erdoƒüanism, particularly the political rhetoric used by its supporters, have been inspired from Islamism, the extensive cult of personality surrounding Erdoƒüan has been argued to have isolated hardline Islamists who are sceptical of his dominance in state policy. The central and overarching authority of Erdoƒüan, a central theme of Erdoƒüanism, has been criticised by Islamists who believe that devotion of followers should not be towards a leader, but rather to Allah and the teachings of Islam. As such, the overarching dominance of Erdoƒüan has furthered Islamist criticism, particularly by Islamist parties such as the Felicity Party (SP), who have claimed that Erdoƒüanism is not based on Islamism but is instead based on authoritarianism using religious rhetoric to maintain public support amongst conservative supporters.

Following a disagreement with others in the Tivoli Gardens management, Carstensen travelled to the Danish West Indies and joined the army there.

It was built in a \\"moorish style\\" and boasted 2,000 seats with balconies in the big concert hall. The Alhambra was very popular the first years, but during the winter-times there were almost no activities, since it was impossible to keep this huge hall heated. Also, the lack of proper lighting in the huge surrounding park-area brought along several night-time accidents in the unfinished park. In the end, the venue didn't stand the competition against the established Tivoli Gardens. and had to close down. The buildings were torn down in 1870.

Plot  Senguttuvan (Aadhi) and Elango (Daniel Annie Pope) are two small-time crooks who work for a local jewel smuggler named \\"Nochukuppam\\" Ramdoss (Munishkanth). Senguttavan is attracted to a young woman Chanakya (Nikki Galrani) whom he sees every morning at the bus stop, however he never manages to speak to her. Chanakya eventually gets married, however her husband doesn't treat her well and physically and verbally abuses her in public. Meanwhile, a Chinese businessman comes to the city looking to acquire an antique emerald medallion named \\"Maragatha Naanayam\\". This stone was owned by an ancient king named Irumporai and is rumoured to be cursed; anyone who laid their hands on the stone died due to a lorry accident, with the lorry rumoured to be driven by the spirit of King Irumporai. He hires a contractor named John (Mime Gopi), who has connections with local gangs that could do the job. He offers 10,00,00,000 for the contract, but no one is willing to do the job as they are afraid of the curse. Only Senguttavan, who is frustrated at the small-time work he is doing under Ramdoss, is interested in the offer as he wants to involve himself in something big and challenging. Elango convinces Senguttuvan to approach a local priest (Kota Srinivasa Rao) who could protect them from the curse. The priest hands Senguttavan and Elango a lemon, at which point the ghosts of the 132 people killed by the curse are revealed to them. The priest tells them that if they are going to pursue the stone, they will need to seek the help of one of the ghosts. Back home, Senguttuvan and Elango complete the ritual to summon one of the ghosts: Elango's uncle Chidambaram. Unfortunately, before the ghost could appear, the duo is interrupted by the news that Ramdoss has died due to a heart attack. During Ramdoss's burial, the lemon accidentally slips from Senguttavan's pocket and falls on Ramdoss's hand, as a result of which Chidambaram's ghost possesses Ramdoss's body and appears in front of Senguttavan and Elango the following morning, much to their shock. The ghost decides to use three recently dead people and possess them with ghosts of three other people killed by the curse to help Senguttavan and Elango in their mission. The first is an old beggar (Sangili Murugan) who died in his sleep alongside the road. The second is a man (Arunraja Kamaraj) who got decapitated in a freak accident. The third happens to be Chanakya, who hanged herself. Chidambaram successfully brings two of the ghosts to their new bodies, but one of them, a Tamil teacher, has trouble staying in the old beggar's body and keeps jumping in and out of the corpse. Senguttuvan, Elango, and the three ghosts, now in their borrowed bodies, pursue the emerald stone. Following an initial lead, they interrogate Pandurangan (M. S. Bhaskar) while posing as the henchmen of a powerful local gang leader \\"Twinkle\\" Ramanathan (Anandaraj). This leads them to recover an emerald medallion, which turns out to be a fake. However, their methods draw the attention of Ramanathan. He previously rejected the idea of pursuing the stone but changes his mind. After realizing that they recovered a replica, the group continues to piece clues together. They find the man who made the fake, who is now on his deathbed. Before he dies, the man gives them clues to who ordered the fake medallion - a local doctor named Krishnan (Gajaraj) who happens to be one of the men killed by the curse. They find his son, who is also a doctor, and kidnap him. Before they can get him to tell them where the original medallion is, they are caught by Ramanathan's henchmen and are taken to his torture chamber. They manage to escape the torturers and eventually find the original medallion. Despite Chidambaram's warning, Senguttuvan and Elango touch the stone and are thereby cursed. They arrange for a meeting with John and the Chinese businessman for the exchange, but on the way, they are pursued by the mysterious driverless lorry. John and the Chinese businessman are run over by the lorry and killed. Senguttuvan manages to elude the lorry initially and recover the suitcase full of money. They then run into the Tamil teacher, who is in the beggar's body. He tells them that they must return the stone to the King's grave to lift the curse. On the way to the gravesite, they are pursued by both the mystery lorry and Ramanathan's gang, who are hell bent on taking the stone from them. The group manages to elude both and get to the gravesite. Before they can return the stone, Ramanathan's gang shows up. Senguttavan makes a deal with Ramanathan that after he places the stone in the King's grave, he can take it, to which he agrees. Senguttuvan and Elango place the stone in the grave and are therefore released from the curse. Ramanathan has one of his henchmen recover the stone. Having completed the job, Senguttuvan and Elango bid goodbye to the four ghosts, who release themselves from the occupied bodies. The ghost occupying Chanakya's body allows an emotional Senguttavan to hear at last the voice of Chanakya and also a declaration of love from her. After Senguttavan and Elango bid a tearful farewell to Chidambaram, all four bodies are laid to rest. During the credits, while Senguttavan and Elango are boarding a bus to return home, they bump into Ramanathan again, who is now on the run. He tells them as his henchman had touched the stone, he and his gang were pursued by the mysterious lorry and his henchman was killed, while he barely managed to escape. But a few minutes later, a pilgrim (Brahmanandam) who had earlier encountered Ramanathan and his gang while they were in pursuit of Senguttavan, Elango and the three ghosts, returns the stone to him, thus activating the curse on Ramanathan and the pilgrim.

(June 24, 1918- May 27, 2005) was an American aerospace engineer of Indian origin who worked in the jet engine and rocket propulsion fields. Rao worked for General Electric in their Gas Turbine Division department and was a research scientist at Marquardt Aircraft, before working for Rocketdyne, where he designed the optimum thrust nozzle. Often referred to as the \\"Rao's nozzle\\", it is part of the standard design for rocket engines. The Rao Nozzle is used currently in rocket, missile, and satellite control systems worldwide. It is taught in universities that offer Aerospace Engineering, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (CalTech), and Georgia Institute of Technology. During his career, he also worked on aerodynamic and fluid dynamic design projects, such as chemical lasers, the space shuttle main engines scramjet and aerospike rocket engines, and wind-powered generators. Personal life and education  On June 24, 1918, Rao was born in Rajahmundry in the Andhra Pradesh province of southeastern India. His father was a school headmaster. Rao was born into a large Brahmin household, and is related to Gadicherla Harisarvottama Rao, a well-known freedom fighter for India's independence. Rao attended Madras Engineering College, and then came to the United States, where he received his D.Sc. in Aeronautical Engineering from New York University in 1949. He met and married Mary Fabrizio in New York, and they subsequently moved to Bangalore, India. Rao and Mary returned to America after their first son, Raman was born. Rao then worked at General Electric. Their second son, Krishna was born, and the family subsequently moved to Woodland Hills, California. In 1976, the Raos moved to Thousand Oaks. Rao died at the age of 86 on May 27, 2005. Career Nozzles of Saturn-V Nozzle of an extensible Cryogenic Engine Educator After receiving his D.Sc., Rao taught in Bangalore, India at the Graduate Research Institute. Aerospace engineer From 1952 to 1955, Rao worked for General Electric in their Gas Turbine Division. He was then a research scientist at Marquardt Aircraft until 1958. Rao then worked for Rocketdyne in California as a design analyst. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Rao began to use mainframe computers at Rocketdyne to make computations for the design of rocket nozzles. Kramer and Wheelock state, \\"Rao developed a method for determining the nozzle contour that would produce the maximum thrust for any given nozzle area ratio and length... The optimum turned out to be not only more efficient but also considerably shorter by about 60% than a 15-degree conical nozzle of the same area.\\" George P. Sutton, who worked with Rao at Rocketdyne, said that \\"bell shape or curved exit contour is used almost universally today for nozzles designed since about 1960 for large as well as small thrust chamber nozzles\\" and for both solid and liquid propellants. In 1963, the Advanced Propulsion Section of NASA published Computation of Plug Nozzle Contours by the Rao Optimum Thrust Method about a study that was performed to design a plug nozzle using Rao‚Äôs maximum thrust theory using a FORTRAN computer program. In 1983, Rao's design was modified, with a slightly different contour, to maximize performance. In 1961, Rao worked at National Engineering Science Company as Associate Director. By 1970, he formed his own company, G. V. R. Rao and Associates, through which he contracted with NASA. He worked at Rockwell International for Marshall Space Flight Center in 1988. During his career, he also worked on aerodynamic and fluid dynamic design projects, such as chemical lasers, the space shuttle main engines scramjet and aerospike rocket engines, and wind-powered generators. His patented inventions include Device for thrust spoiling and thrust reversal (1957), Quiet fan with non-radial elements (1975), Shock wave suppressing flow plate for pulsed lasers (1984), and Mixing aids for supersonic flows (1990).

While to some extent this is true, they nevertheless played a significant role, taking part in such activities including armed combat (which was frowned upon by the church), in the battles in the Holy Land. This article focuses on the First Crusades and identifies known participants. It also highlights some of the more famous women of the later crusades. For a discussion of the sociological and religious aspects of the mixing of women with the generally male crusaders, the reader is referred to the referenced documents. Further information can be found in Women of the Crusader States or in the companion article Crusades. While many women remained home to act as regents for their estates during the crusades, others accompanied their husbands and other family members on their quests, even going so far as to fight in emergency situations when their menfolk fell in battle. It was no surprise that noblewomen would participate in combat in certain situations, their upbringing likely preparing them for this possibility, going so far as to include lessons on riding into battle. However, it was not only noblewomen who participated in the crusades. Women who were of the common people were also present throughout the venture, performing tasks such as removing lice from soldiers' heads and/or washing clothes. In fact, the washerwoman was the only role for a woman approved by the Catholic Church and permitted during the First Crusade, as long as they were unattractive, for fear that the troops would engage with them in sexual relations. However, this stipulation was typically not obeyed and all types and classes of women took part in the crusades. Every time an army marched, several women would join them as sutlers or servants, as well as prostitutes. Unmentioned in victory, they took the blame for defeat and were purged from the campaign several times throughout the crusades, for relations with them were considered sinful among soldiers who had left their homelands to fight a holy cause and were supposed to be pure in thought and deed. In addition, numerous nuns also accompanied the religious men, namely priests and bishops, that traveled as part of the quests, while others actually took up arms, an anathema to their Muslim foes. The appearance of women was rare among western chroniclers whose focus was more male-dominated. However, mentions of female crusaders are more commonly found in Muslim accounts of the Crusades, but the truth of these stories are hard to prove as fact as the aggressiveness or unnaturalness of Christian women was often seen as a way for Muslims to demonstrate how ruthless and depraved their foes could be. During the later crusades, many women whose stories remain were from the Middle East region, including one of a Muslim woman who fought the crusaders.  Contemporaneous Historians  The story of women in the Crusades begins with Anna Comnena, the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. She wrote a valuable history of the First Crusade,Anna Comnena: Byzantine Princess (n.d). https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anna-Comnena providing a view of the campaign from the Byzantine elite's perspective, although her work has been described as a family panegyric rather than a serious history. She, unfortunately, was exiled to a monastery before the work could be finished. The challenges faced by women of the crusades can be summarized by writings by Fulcher of Chartres, chaplain of Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who stated: \\"Then the Franks, having again consulted together, expelled the women from the army, the married as well as the unmarried, lest perhaps defiled by the sordidness of riotous living should displease the Lord. These women then sought shelter for themselves in neighboring towns.\\" Fulcher noted that mass hysteria had surrounded the holy quest of the Crusades, richly demonstrated by the belief that even a lowly waterfowl led by a nun [see below], had been blessed by the Holy Spirit and would lead them to Jerusalem.  Nuns of the First Crusade  A large number of nuns are believed to have traveled to the Holy Land during the Crusades, but only three are known from the First Crusade, and for only one of these do we know a name. [Note that Riley-Smith uses the term \\"anonyma\\" to refer to a woman of unknown name and this write up does the same.] * Anonyma of Cambrai, was the religious leader of a sect traveling with Count Emich of Flonheim, who believed her goose to be filled with the Holy Spirit, even going so far as to allow the spirit-filled animal to direct the sect's course. The sect was not heard of again after the goose died. This story is reported by Fulcher and Albert of Aix. That Gulbert of Nogent suggested that the goose may then have been served as a holiday meal requires no further comment. * Anonyma, nun of the monastery of Santa Maria and Correa, Trier, who, as part of the People's Crusade, was taken by the Muslims during the Battle of Civetot that devastated the force of Peter the Hermit, who had returned to Constantinople for supplies. When she was liberated in 1097, she apparently eloped with her Turkish captor. Her name remains a mystery. * Americas, a nun of Altejas, who, following Pope Urban's direction, went to her bishop for his blessing, which was granted, to found a hospice for the poor.  Wives of the First Crusaders  According to Riley-Smith, there were seven of the wives of the first Crusaders that accompanied their husbands to the Holy Land. An eighth participated in the 1107 battles of Bohemond of Antioch- Tatanto against the Byzantine Empire (sometimes referred to as a crusade). They were as follows. * Godehilde, daughter of Raoul II of Tosny, Seigneur de Conches-en-Ouche, who accompanied her husband Baldwin I of Jerusalem, as well as a contingent of their household. While he was marching to Cilicia, she fell ill and died in Kahramanmara≈ü, Turkey, depriving him of the funding from her lands. He later entered into bigamous marriages with an Armenian, Arda, whom he abandoned, and Adelaide del Vasto. If the rumors of his homosexuality were true, his multiple marriages were certainly for personal gain and his behavior on the crusade did not meet the accepted standards of chivalry of the time. * Hadvide, daughter of Arnold I, Count of Chiny, who accompanied her husband Dodo of Cons, a confidant of Godfrey of Bouillon. Both Hadvide and Dodo returned from the crusade unscathed. Arnold, a conspirator against Godfrey, among his many other misdeeds, did not have his sons take the cross, as erroneously reported by a later count, the opportunistic Louis V. Hadvide's support of her husband appears to be the only redeeming act of this generation of the Chiny countship. * Elvira of Leon-Castile, illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, who traveled, while pregnant, with her husband Raymond IV of St. Gilles, Count of Toulouse. After her husband was killed at the siege of Tripoli in 1106, she gave birth to their son Alfonso Jordan, later Count of Toulouse, and then returned home to Castile. There she married Fernando Fern√°ndez de Carri√≥n and had three additional children. * Emeline, who traveled with her husband Fulcher (Folbert) of Bullion. No further information is known on either person. * Emma of Hereford, Countess of Norfolk, traveled with her husband Ralph I of Gael, a Breton leader first under Robert Curthose, and then with Bohemund I of Antioch during the siege of Nicaea. Ralph was a participant in the Revolt of the Earls against the rule of William the Conqueror. Emma's parents were William Fitz-Osbern and Adeliza (daughter of Roger I of Tosny), and so was cousin to Baldwin's wife Godehilde, described above. Both Emma and her husband died en route to Jerusalem. * Florine of Burgundy accompanied her husband Sweyn in the First Crusade. She, a warrior like her husband, is discussed in detail below. * Humberge of Le Puiset traveled with her husband Walo II of Chaumont-en-Vexin. Humberge was the sister of the Crusader Everard III of Le Puiset, Viscount of Chartres, and daughter of Hugues \\"Blavons\\" de Bretenil and Alix de Montlh√©ry (daughter of Guy I of Montlh√©ry). Walo was killed during the Siege of Antioch in 1098, but it remains unclear as to the fate of Humberge. Their son Drogo was also prominent in the First Crusade. * Edith, daughter of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, accompanied her husband Gerard of Gournay-en-Bray with both the armies of Hugh the Great and Robert Curthose. Their son Hugh II fought in the Second Crusade. * Mabel of Roucy, who accompanied her husband Hugh I of Jaffa to the Holy Land. * Helie of Burgundy, accompanied her husband Bertrand of Toulouse in his quest to claim the role of Count of Tripoli. * Anonyma of L√®ves accompanied her husband Ralph the Red of Pont-Echanfray, in the Crusade of Bohemond of Antioch-Taranto, 1107-1108. Anonyma was the daughter of Odeline of Le Puiset and Joscelin of L√®ves, and so was the cousin of Humberge of Le Puiset. Ralph had been a loyal knight of Bohemond's father Robert Guiscard. Ralph died in the White Ship disaster of 1120. * Emeline, accompanied her husband Fulcher of Bouillon, a knight in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon, captured and beheaded during the siege of Antioch. She was captured, taken to Azaz and married to a Turkish mercenary. * Corba of Thorigne, wife of Geoffrey Burel, Lord of Amboise, who participated in the Crusade of 1101. Corba was captured by the Turks and her ultimate fate is unknown.  Warrior Women of the Crusades  A number of women took the cross and battled the Muslims, some with their husbands, some without; numerous royal women fought as Crusaders, and at least one against them. The six most prominent examples of these warriors are given below, the most famous of which is Eleanor of Aquitaine. * Florine of Burgundy, a warrior-princess who accompanied her husband Sweyn the Crusader, Prince of Denmark in the First Crusade. Florine was the daughter of Odo I, Duke of Burgundy, and his wife Sybilla (an ancestor of Marie Antoinette), while Sweyn was one of up to twenty children of Sweyn II, King of Denmark, by various concubines. Florine and Sweyn commanded a force of 1,500 cavalries progressing across the plains of Cappadocia when they were ambushed by an overwhelming Turkish force. Both were killed along with most of their force. * Ida of Formbach-Ratelnbert (Ida of Cham), widow of Leopold II, Margrave of Austria. During the Crusade of 1101, Ida led an army marching towards Jerusalem. They were ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan I and, depending on the source, she was either killed or carried off to his harem. * Cecilia of Le Bourcq, Lady of Tarsus, sister of Baldwin II of Jerusalem and wife of Roger of Salerno, prince-regent of Antioch. Cecilia helped organize the defenses of Antioch in the Muslim attacks of 1119 in which her husband was killed. * Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem, daughter of Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Melisende, ruler of Jerusalem after her father's death, sent an army to aid the Crusader state of Edessa which was under siege and eventually fell. Her pleas to Pope Eugene III for help led to the disastrous Second Crusade. *Ermengard of Anjou, divorced wife of William IX of Aquitaine and daughter of Fulk IV of Anjou, who went on an unspecified crusade after 1118. * Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen consort of the Franks. Eleanor accompanied her husband Louis VII on the Second Crusade, as the leader of the soldiers from the Duchy of Aquitaine, which included some of her royal ladies-in- waiting. The crusade accomplished little, and the disagreements on strategy between the king and queen eventually led to the annulment of their marriage. Her subsequent marriage to Henry II of England produced a son, Richard the Lionheart. After becoming king, Richard led the English contingent in the Third Crusade, with Eleanor serving as regent in his absence. * Shajar al- Durr, Sultan (or, incorrectly, Sultana) of Egypt during the Seventh Crusade. As wife of sultan As-Salih Ayyub, who had become gravely ill, Shajar helped organize the defenses of Egypt. After the sultan's death, the army supported her in becoming the first female sultan. Shajar's forces defeated the leader of the crusade, Louis IX of France, at Damietta. The Caliph al-Musta'sim in Baghdad refused to allow her the throne and installed the Mamluk Izz al-Din Aybak in her place. Shajar married Aybak and ruled with him for seven years. Unsure of her position, Shajar had him murdered by her servants; subsequently, she was stripped and beaten to death by the servants of Aybak's 15-year-old son and former wife. Thrown naked from the top of the Red Tower, she lay in the surrounding moat for three days until finally being buried in a tomb near the Mosque of Ibn Tulun. * Margaret of Provence, Queen consort of France. Margaret accompanied her husband Louis IX and sister Beatrice on the Seventh Crusade. After her husband's capture, she led the negotiations for his release and, in fact, was the only woman to ever lead a crusade, if however briefly. Her bravery and decisiveness were chronicled by her contemporary, Jean de Joinville.  Other Women of the Crusades  The stories of numerous other women who played a role in the Crusades have been documented. Here is a list of those known at this time. All can be referenced from Volume III of Ranchman's \\"A History of the Crusades.\\" * Isabella I, Queen regent of Jerusalem during the Third Crusade. * Eudokia Angelina, first consort of Stefan the First-Crowned of Serbia and later the mistress of Alexios V Doukas, with whom she fled Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. * Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, wife of Emperor Alexios III Angelos, left behind in Constantinople as her husband fled during the Fourth Crusade. * Margaret of Hungary, daughter of B√©la III of Hungary, first married to Emperor Isaac II Angelos and then Boniface of Montferrat, leader of the Fourth Crusade. * Maria of Antioch-Armenia was Lady of Toron, a major Crusader castle in Lebanon when, at the end of the Sixth Crusade, land taken by Saladin was returned to Armenia. * Eleanor of Castile accompanied her husband Edward I of England on the Eighth Crusade and gave birth to their daughter Joan of Acre in the Holy Land. * Isabella of Aragon, Queen consort of France, accompanied her husband Phillip III of France on the Eighth Crusade. * Alice of Jerusalem, Princess consort of Antioch. * Constance of Antioch, Princess of Antioch. * Lucia of Tripoli, the last countess of Tripoli.  Regents of the Estates of the Crusaders  While the men of the Crusades died in frequent battles, the women lived in comparative indolence. They lived long lives and acted as regents to their estates and young children. As widows, they held a degree of independence that they had previously lacked, allowing them control over their own property, the opportunity to preside over courts and trade meetings, and fulfilling obligations of military and political service, in direct contravention of European gender norms of the period. As more and more property became concentrated in their hands it became obvious that women constituted one of the main sources of \\"continuity\\" in the Frankish Levant. Furthermore, for many women in the Frankish Levant marriage was a way for them to advance both socially and financially, allowing them to move up in status with their husband when he was alive and then prosper even more by inheriting more land when said husband died. For instance, Agnes of Courtenay, originally a noblewoman of Edessa, remarried multiple times and by the time of her death in 1186 was \\"... the first lady in the kingdom (of Jerusalem), wife of the Lord of Sidon, dowager lady of Ramla and Lady of Toron in her own right.\\" As a result of these frequent remarriages widowed princesses and countesses carried the substantial estates to their next husbands and became seen as a prize, with various European men leaving their homes for a landed wife in the Levant. According to the courts of Outremer, half to a third of the assets of the deceased went to the widow, while the other portion was held in reserve for his children or heirs. This system had dramatic consequences for both the Frankish Levant and Europe. In Europe land was mainly transferred through primogeniture during this period, making the power structure itself more fixed, with dowries becoming more money-based in an effort to keep land in the family. In comparison, in Outremer lands, often reverted to the Crown before there was a chance for nobles to establish their own dynasties before they were either killed or died, allowing the Crown to retain a higher degree of control than in Europe. Here is a partial list of those who stayed behind to manage the estates as their husbands took the cross. From the First Crusade: * Ermengarde of Anjou, daughter of Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, married to Alan IV, Duke of Brittany. She served as regent of the duchy in her husband's absence on the First Crusade and possibly went to Palestine, likely on the Second Crusade. * Arda of Armenia, the 2nd wife of Baldwin I of Jerusalem following the death of Godehilde (see above) and the first Queen consort of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. This was a politically convenient marriage that allowed Baldwin to become the first Count of Edessa. * Adelaide del Vasto, the 3rd wife of Baldwin I of Jerusalem, married apparently while he was still married to Arda. Adelaide's son Roger II of Sicily by her first marriage refused to support the Crusader states during the Second Crusade due to the treatment of his mother by Jerusalem. * Morphia of Melitene, wife of Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem. She was mother of Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem, discussed above. * Clementia of Burgundy, wife of Robert II, Count of Flanders, who formed an army for the First Crusade. * Ida of Leuven, daughter of Henry II, Count of Leuven and sister of Godfrey I of Leuven, was married to Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut, who served in the First Crusade with Godfrey of Bouillon. When her husband had vanished, Ida organized a search in the Holy Land to find him, but her efforts were to no avail as he had clearly died. * Constance of France, Princess of Antioch, daughter of Phillip I of France and Bertha of Holland. Constance first married to Hugh I, Count of Troyes, but their marriage ended in divorce on the grounds of consanguinity. She then married Bohemond I of Antioch, recently released by the Turks. She accompanied her husband to Apulia, where she gave birth to Bohemond II, Prince of Antioch. After her husband's death, she served as regent for her son. Imprisoned by Grimoald, Prince of Bari, she gave up her regency, dying in 1125. Her granddaughter was Constance, Princess of Antioch, who in turn had Empress Maria, Bohemund III of Antioch, and Agnes, Queen of Hungary. * Adela of Normandy, daughter of William the Conqueror, married to Stephen II, Count of Blois, half-brother to Hugh I, Count of Troyes. After Stephen's death in the minor Crusade of 1102, Adela became the regent of Stephen's estate, and Constance of France served in her court. Among the children of Adela and Stephen were the future King of England, Stephen. * Estefania, daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, and aunt to Constance, Queen of France. Estefania was married to Centule II, Count of Bigorre, whose successes in the First Crusade were minor, but played a major role in breaking the feudal connection with France. * Ad√®le of Marie and Sibyl of Ch√¢teau-Porcien, were both married to the scandalous Enguerrand I, Lord of Coucy. Ad√®le was granddaughter to Gilbert, Count of Roucy. Enguerrand repudiated Ad√®le on the grounds of adultery, with the blessing of Elinand, Bishop of Laon, and then kidnapped Sibyl who was at the time married to Godfrey I, Count of Namur. The kidnapped Sibyl was at the time pregnant with Enguerrand's child, Agn√®s de Coucy. Sibyl, in her favor, was the great- grandmother of Robert of Thourotte, Bishop of Langres and Li√®ge. Both Enguerrand and Thomas, his son by Ad√®le, while bitter enemies and rivals, both took the cross and fought in the First Crusade. Thomas succeeded his father as Lord of Coucy upon his death. * Mary of Scotland, daughter of Malcolm III, King of the Scots, married to Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, the brother of Godfrey of Bouillon. Eustace distinguished himself numerous times as a Crusader and returned unscathed to his estates. Their daughter Matilda was Queen consort of England, as wife of Stephen of England. * Talesa of Aragon, daughter of Sancho Ram√≠rez, Count of Ribagorza, and therefore granddaughter of Ramiro I, the first King of Aragon. Talesa was married to Gaston IV \\"le Crois√©\\", Viscount of B√©arn, and acted as regent for him and, after his death, for their son Centule VI after Gaston's death in 1131. Their descendants Gaston VI and Gaston VII were valiant participants in later crusades. * Hodierna, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Rethel, was married to H√©ribrand III, Lord of Hierges, and was regent of his estates during his absence during the First Crusade. Her brother was Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem. She secondly married Roger of Salerno, Prince of Antioch. * Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois, was daughter of Herbert IV, Count of Vermandois and Adele of Valois, and married to renowned Crusader Hugh the Great, Count of Vermandois, a title granted by right of his wife (jure uxoris). Hugh fought in the First Crusade and then in the minor Crusade of 1101, where he was wounded by the Turks and died that October. She was the last member of the Carolingian dynasty. * Hildegarde, daughter of Aimery IV of Thouars, a proven companion of William the Conqueror, was married to Hugh VI \\"the Devil\\" of Lusignan, who took the cross along with his brothers Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, a leader of the First Crusade, and Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona. * Gertrud de Louvain, daughter of Henry III, Count of Louvain, and Gertrude of Flanders, Duchess of Lorraine, was married to Lambert, Count of Montaigu, who played a major role in the First Crusade along with his father Conan and brother Gozelo. * Marguerite of Clermont, daughter of Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en- Beauvaisis (a member of the Crusader Army of Hugh the Great), was married to Charles the Good, Count of Flanders, a crusader who was offered the crown of Jerusalem, but refused. Later, Charles was hacked to death while in prayer in Bruges, Belgium, by rival knights.  Further reading  * Komnene, Anna, The Alexiad, translated by E.R.A. Sewter, ed.

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets that may be transiting their stars. On January 6, 2015, along with the notable stars of Kepler-438 and Kepler-440, it was announced that the star has an extrasolar planet (a super-Earth) orbiting within the habitable zone, named Kepler-442b. Nomenclature and history Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-442 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19012797+3916482. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 4138008, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-4742. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"Kepler-442\\". The discoverers referred to the star as Kepler-442, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planet. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\" etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planet candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, there was only candidate planet were detected, with an orbital period of 112.3053 days. The designation b derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-442, there was only one planet detected, so only the letter b is used. The name Kepler-442 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 442nd star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. Stellar characteristics Kepler-442 is a K-type main sequence star that is approximately 61% the mass of and 60% the radius of the Sun. It has a temperature of 4402 K and is about 2.9 billion years old, but the margin of error here is quite large. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is somewhat poor in metals, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of about ‚Äì0.37, or about 42% of the amount of iron and other heavier metals found in the Sun. The star's luminosity is a bit low for a star like Kepler-442, with a luminosity of around 11% of that of the solar luminosity. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14.976. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system The only known planet transits the star; this means that the planet's orbit appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Its inclination relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight it is, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planet's periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring the planet's transit of the star. Kepler-442b is a super-Earth with a radius 1.34 times that of Earth, and orbits well within the habitable zone. It is likely a rocky planet due to its radius. According to NASA, it was described as being one of the most Earth-like planets, in terms of size and temperature, yet found. It is outside of the zone (around 0.02 AU) where tidal forces from its host star would be enough to tidally lock it.

First Adrian The first Adrian was the cutter Industry, of 84 tons (bm). She was armed with eight 12-pounder carronades. She served under contract from 21 August 1804 to 25 August 1805. During her service she was renamed Adrian. Adrian was in company with the frigate when on 1 and 2 June 1805 Adrian captured the chasse- mar√©es Marie and Sophie. At the time Adrian was under the command of Lieutenant Joseph Bain Bett, who apparently transferred from the hired armed cutter Rhoda. Marie was one of three chasse-mar√©es that on 1 June he observed sailing to Brest. Adrian succeeded in first driving Marie ashore, and then capturing her. However, as the prize crew was retrieving her, a musket ball killed Adrians mate. Marie had been carrying a cargo of wine and brandy from Bordeaux to Brest. The other two chasse-mar√©es escaped.Leyland (Leyland (1902), Vol. 2, Vol 21, p.282. Before her contract with the Navy, Industry may have been the cutter Industry, William Johns, master, of 85 tons (bm), that received a letter of marque on 20 June 1803. This Industry was armed with six 1, 1¬Ω, and 2-pounder guns, and four swivel guns, and had a crew of 36 men. Second Adrian Although the second hired armed cutter Adrian captured several enemy merchant vessels, the usual sources carry no information about the vessel herself; we have no information regarding her dimensions, size, or armament. We have the names of two of her commanders covering about three years of some five years or more years of service, but no information on the duration of her contract with the Royal Navy. At some point in 1807 Adrian was under the command of Lieutenant John Forbes. On 28 July 1807 Adrian was under the command of Lieutenant John Carter when she took the Danish ship Thetis, Peder Belousen, master. On 30 January 1808 the schooner was reconnoitering the harbour at Brest when she hit the sunken Parquette Rock.{sfnpGosset1986p=66}} , Adrian, and the cutter all tried to get her off, but their efforts were in vain. The vessels in attendance were able to save Capelins crew. On 26 October 1809, Lieutenant Charles Marsh Cumby was appointed to command Adrian, a command that he held for 10 months.Gentleman's Magazine, (December 1849), vol. 32, p.651. While on Adrian, Cumby captured 14 merchant vessels, and \\"greatly annoyed the enemy's coasting trade.\\"Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.144. On 9 November Adrian, , , Christian VII, Milford, Naiad, Unicorn, and the hired armed cutter Nimrod were all in sight when captured the French brig Modeste. On 4 January 1810 Adrian captured Fortune. On 24 March, the brig Julie came into Plymouth. Adrian had captured Julie as she was sailing from Nantz to Brest,Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4444. Accessed 29 July 2016. on 6 March.

Regulations  Germany's Animal Welfare Act creates an offence of willfully or negligently inflicting substantial pain, suffering, or injury to an animal without reasonable cause. The Act specifies a list of prohibited acts, including overloading, training using significant pain, suffering or damage, abandonment, and force-feeding other than for health reasons. \\"Animal\\" is not defined in the Act, but the Act references vertebrates, warm-blooded animals, fish, cold-blooded animals, amphibians, reptiles, and cephalopods. The Act's duty of care and anti-cruelty requirements apply to farmed animals. Particularly relevant are the prohibitions on force-feeding and the use of devices which significantly limit the species-specific behavior of an animal. The Act requires stunning of warm-blooded animals before slaughter, with an exemption for religious slaughter. The Act gives powers to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to make secondary regulations on issues such as accommodation, training, transport, and slaughter. Secondary regulations also include the incorporation of European Union legislation on farm animal welfare. Regarding the use of animals in science, the Act encompasses elements of The Three Rs principles (replace the use of animals in research where possible, reduce the number of animals used, and refine methods to minimize pain, suffering, or distress). Facilities which test on vertebrates and cephalopods are required to have an Animal Welfare Officer. In 2002 the German Constitution was amended to include the protection of animals as a state goal. In 2014 Germany received a B out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index. This was lowered to a C grade in their 2020 Animal Protection Index.  Animals used for food   Animal agriculture  The German poultry industry consists of approximately 34 million laying hens, 60 million broilers, and 11 million turkeys. There are around 12.9 million head of cattle in total, including dairy cows and suckler cows. In 2011 Germany had Europe's largest pig population at over 27.4 million. In 2016, a German court ruled that chick culling, in which male chicks are killed by being gassed or ground alive, does not violate animal protection laws. Several million chicks are killed by these methods in Germany each year.  Veganism  A 2009 survey found that 9% of German respondents identified as vegetarian. Data on the prevalence of veganism is not available.  Animals used in research  In 2016, 2.19 million procedures were performed on animals in research. When animals killed for tissues or organs (but not undergoing any prior procedure) are included the number of animals is just under 2.80 million. The number of animals rose steadily from around 1.8 million in 2000 to over 3 million in 2014, before coming back down below 3 million. In 2016, 61% of procedures were classified as mild, 23% as moderate, 5% as severe, and 11% as non-recovery (in which the animal is anaesthetised and never woken up). In 2014, animal activists released graphic undercover footage of monkeys being used for brain research in Germany, provoking a public outcry. The monkeys in the video were bloodied, obviously distressed, and some were left in cages without food or water to make them compliant with the experimental procedures. A 2009 German opinion poll found that 89% of Germans agreed that the European Union protection laws should forbid all animal testing that causes pain and suffering.  Animal activism  The Albert Schweitzer Foundation for Our Contemporaries (ASF) is a German animal non-profit focused on helping farmed animals through corporate outreach campaigns to adopt higher-welfare policies (e.g. cage-free eggs), vegan outreach, and other activities. As of 2016 it is one of Animal Charity Evaluators' Standout Charities. SOKO Tierschutz is a German animal rights organization which conducts undercover investigations of farms and animal research laboratories. In December 2014, SOKO Tierschutz organized around 800 people to protest against research on non-human primates in Germany.

He was Capomastro delle Opere della Religione, the principal architect of the Order of St. John, from 1681 until Francesco Zerafa became his assistant in 1714 and eventually succeeded him. Biography In 1685 it was decided to build a new parish church for Lija. The town's parish priest, Don Anton Camillieri, invited Barbara and Lorenzo Gaf√† to prepare designs for the church, and Barbara's design was chosen. The church would be completed during the 18th century. He designed a skew arch at Sa Maison in Floriana, which was a marvel of construction and became known as the arco Barbara. This was built as part of the Floriana Lines fortifications, and it was completed in 1726. Several other buildings, such as the Church of St. James in Valletta, and Palazzo Vilhena and the Seminary in Mdina, are sometimes also attributed to Barbara. There is no proof about these claims and they were most likely designed by other architects. The Mdina Seminary was completed in 1740, around ten years after the death of Barbara.
