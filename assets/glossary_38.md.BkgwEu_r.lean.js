Due to a failure in a spacecraft system, the ground team was unable to actively command the satellite and spacecraft became just a passive object in Earth orbit by which some passive drag characteristics might be deduced.  Status  DANDE launched on 29 September 2013 and correctly separated from the launch vehicle. After a month of assessing spacecraft health, successful separation of the Lightband Adaptor Bracket (LAB) was conducted on 30 October over the Starfire Optical Range in Maui. The next step was planned to be spin- up and alignment. However, a failure in a spacecraft system prevented that. The DANDE team reported on 9 January 2014 that they had \\"been unable to actively command DANDE [but that they were] collecting passive drag data through analysis of the TLE's.\\"reports  Origin  DANDE was elected as an entry to the University Nanosat Program competition, a two-year program that is now in its seventh iteration. In 2009, DANDE won additional money and a future flight to orbit, propelling the project into an independent and master's research project. DANDE is the first CU student-built satellite launch opportunity in five years. To date, about 100 students have been involved in DANDE through construction, testing, and operations. The density of the atmosphere varies greatly due to space weather and other unknown processes. The International Space Station once dropped in height by tens of kilometers in a span of a few days and by understanding drag forces and composition of the atmosphere we can provide better data about this phenomenon. A basic internal view of the DANDE satellite.  Science  Drag induced by the neutral-atmosphere density is the major perturbation on satellites in low earth orbit. True density deviates as much as 21% from model predictions, introducing error into crucial government and private space operations with applications to situational awareness, space surveillance, laser communications, re-entry prediction, rendezvous and proximity ops. A need exists to measure physical or 'true' density, quantify density variations, and to provide in-situ model calibration data. DANDE Drag Equation The operating principle is to solve the full drag equation: Each variable is isolated either by an a priori knowledge or via in-situ measurement. The mass (m) and area (A) are based on the physical parameters that can be measured prior to launch. The Coefficient of Drag is simulated using the external geometry of the spacecraft in its science collection state. Density (œÅ), Acceleration (a), and a Wind Vector are sensed by two onboard instruments, the first is a high precision Accelerometer suite (ACC) that amplifies the Œºg drag signal in the along track axis of the spacecraft. Secondary to that is a Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) that can provide data products relating the wind vector with respect to the spacecraft ram-vector as well as the numerical density of the constituents in the atmosphere. The idea is that at orbital velocities the spacecraft traveling through even a stagnant atmosphere will have collisions with the species present at energies of several Electron-Volts (eV) of which there are still billions per cubic meter.https://sites.google.com/site/asen5050kemble/ DANDE is spherical in nature so the projected cross-sectional area is held nearly constant. This leverages a simplified attitude subsystem design as opposed to a full three- axis stabilized system. Further spinning about orbit normal allows the accelerometer instrument, located so the spin-axis is perpendicular to the acceleration sense axis, to accept in a modulated acceleration profile. There were issues that make having GPS on board the spacecraft prohibitive. As a student program the cost of an unlock GPS receiver that could provide data products in orbital scenarios was a chief concern, but the spacecraft attitude state would not be conducive to consistently providing a lock at all times when geolocating data. High Task Tracking is a possibility through Air Force Space Command Research and Analysis group, but that agreement does not solve all the needs at the beginning of the mission when the desire is to make contact and begin commissioning.

This species is endemic to a single mountain range in Western Australia.Lowrie, Allen. 2005. A taxonomic revision of Drosera section Stolonifera (Droseraceae), from south-west Western Australia. Nuytsia, 15(3): 355-394. Drosera monticola is a small herbaceous plant, usually growing from 2 to 7 centimeters tall. Like other members of its section, the habit of the taxon widely differs between the flowering and non-flowering forms that the plant takes in its life cycle. It is tuberous, producing bright red, globose tubers some six millimeters in diameter. Like other Drosera, the leaves of this taxon are reddish and circular, covered in carnivorous glands that allow it to capture and digest various types of arthropods. The reddish leaves grow in whorls around the erect stems of the plant. Unlike some members of the genus, the circular leaves of D. monticola are incapable of folding onto any prey that they catch. The flowering form of this taxon blooms from October to November, producing a glabrous raceme with terminal pink flowers. However, it also reproduces asexually by forming colonies. The mature seeds of the plant remain undescribed and unknown. This species is entirely endemic to the summits of Toolbrunup Peak and Bluff Knoll in the Stirling Range National Park, a range of mountains in Southwestern Australia. It is specifically limited to extremely high elevations, such as the cloud-lines of the mountain summits in its range. In these environments, it can only be found in winter- wet loamy soils collecting on ledges and depressions. While its discoverers have stated that the taxon can probably be found on the summits of other mountains within the Stirling Range, actual specimens have only been collected from the two peaks previously mentioned. It was first formally described as a subspecies of D. stolonifera by Allen Lowrie and N. G. Marchant in 1992. The type specimen was collected from the summit of Toolbrunup Peak, and labeled PERTH 02642964. In a 2005 journal article, Lowrie elevated the subspecies to the species level as Drosera monticola but did not properly cite the basionym of the proposed species, making the new scientific name invalid according to Article 33.4 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Thus that name was not valid and the taxon formally remained a subspecies of Drosera stolonifera. Lowrie corrected this error in a short note in the 2011 volume of the journal Nuytsia where he provided the correct page number for the basionym and finally validated the name Drosera monticola.Lowrie, Allen. 2011.

The eggs of A. walkeri are laid directly on the water surface in freshwater swamp habitats. Since its eggs are not resistant to desiccation, this species is restricted to swampy regions with plenty of water. Anopheles walkeri, as with many other anophelines, begins to become active later in the evening than most other mosquito species in its range. This species becomes especially active late at night when in search of a blood meal. Feeding activity is affected greatly by environmental conditions within its microclimate. Wind, low humidity and cool temperatures (around and below), are all negatively correlated with feeding aggression. Life cycle A. punctipennis; 67, A. crucians; 68, A. quadrimaculatus; 69, A. walkeri. Anopheles walkeri has a multivoltine life cycle. It produces a hardy winter egg which differs morphologically from the more vulnerable summer eggs by having enlarged floats on the dorsal side. By overwintering in egg form, this species is able to mature through one full larval generation before hibernating adults of other species are able to become active. The multivoltine life cycle means this species is active during both the swampy, open water conditions of early spring, as well as later in the year after the swampland has become thickened with plant growth. It takes about 10 days to mature through the larval stages and pupate, dependent on temperature and water conditions. Adults will typically mate within a few hours of emergence from their pupated form. The females then begin to seek out a blood meal to provide necessary protein to facilitate egg development. The female will then rest while the eggs develop. Once mature, the eggs are oviposited and the female begins the process all over again, feeding and laying for the 40 days or so that it lives for. Epidemiology Due to habitat preferences, coupled with particularly low rates of virus detection, Anopheles walkeri is considered to be an unlikely vector of West Nile virus to humans. In addition, it has not been shown to demonstrate any capacity of transmitting avian malaria (Plasmodium circumflexum and P. polare). However, specimens of A. walkeri in the southern United States have been shown to harbor the human infecting strains of malaria, Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, albeit infrequently (freq= <0.005).

Family and early life Andrew Snape Douglas was born in Edinburgh on 8 October 1761, the son of Dr. William Douglas, a medical doctor of Springfield, and Lydia Hamond, daughter of a London merchant and shipowner. William Douglas's death in 1770 led Andrew to sign on that year aboard his maternal uncle, Sir Andrew Snape Hamond's ship, the 32-gun frigate . The two sailed to North America, and after spending time along the coast, Douglas moved to the West Indies. With the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 he returned to North America and rejoined his uncle, now commanding the 44-gun . He received his commission as a lieutenant on 23 April 1778, and was made master and commander on 16 February 1780. He was to have been appointed to the armed ship Germain, but instead took command of a floating battery, and was present at the Siege of Charleston. He was subsequently promoted to post-captain on 15 May 1780 and appointed to the command of the captured American frigate . Instead he had in April 1780 become commander of the Roebuck, then serving as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot. He went on to capture the American ships on 14 April 1781 and Protector on 5 May. He was succeeded in the command of the Roebuck by Captain John Orde in July 1781. Command The Roebuck was ordered home in July 1781, but Douglas remained in American waters, having been given command of the 54-gun . He was employed in a senior position in Admiral Thomas Graves's fleet owing to his extensive knowledge of the American coasts. He was subsequently given command of a squadron of frigates and went on to enjoy considerable success in a number of cruises. Among his captures was the 32-gun French frigate Magicienne on 2 July 1781, an action that thwarted a planned French assault on British ships in the St John River. He then proceeded to end the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782). Douglas returned to England after the end of the war, initially spending time at Chatham Dockyard studying naval architecture, before going to sea again, mostly serving in the Mediterranean and the English Channel. Douglas commanded the 74-gun third rate from October 1787 during the period of the Spanish Armament.Royal Navy Biography, Or, Memoirs of the Services of All the Flag Officers..., John Marshall, p. 174 He was in command of the 32-gun , which had been appointed the guard ship at Weymouth, when the town was visited by King George III. Douglas conducted the King on his first voyage aboard a warship, and on 13 September 1789 King George appointed Douglas a knight bachelor.The Annual Register; Or, a View of the History, Politics, and Literature for the Year 1789, Edmund Burke, p. 267 Also in 1789 Douglas and his uncle Snape Hamond were members of the court for the court martial of the mutineers of the Bounty. Douglas was then in command of the 74-gun from 1790. French Revolutionary Wars Philip James de Loutherbourg's Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June. The Queen Charlotte, under Douglas's command and flying the flag of Lord Howe, engages the French. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793 led to Douglas being appointed to command the 38-gun frigate . He went on to capture five enemy vessels that year, and was involved in the capture of a French privateer and her prize, the Spanish galleon St Jago. Lord Howe arranged for Douglas to be commodore in charge of the fleet's frigates, occasionally sending him on detached cruises. He moved aboard Howe's flagship, the 100-gun first rate on 8 April 1794, apparently through the auspices of both his uncle and the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham. Now serving as Howe's flag captain Douglas fought at the Glorious First of June, sustaining a severe wound to the head but refusing to leave the deck. He was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 1 June 1795 and remained as captain of the Queen Charlotte after Howe was succeeded by Lord Bridport. He commanded his ship at the Battle of Groix in 1795, earning private praise for his courage in leading his ship whilst heavily outnumbered, but little public reward.

The traditional view, given by the U.S. Supreme Court, was that policy makers were confronted by a \\"tragedy of the commons\\" and were forced by circumstances to manage wireless services. Ronald Coase critiqued the idea that government control was inevitable, but argued that policymakers were unaware of market alternatives. Hazlett showed that radio broadcasting actually developed according to common law property rules and that the move to political control was the result of pressure by incumbent radio stations and key policy makers (including Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover) to foreclose competitive entry.

M. Lelen, PhD was an author, translator, poet, and philosopher who corresponded with many notable figures in his lifetime. Early life He was born Joseph Leleu at Sailly, France December 24, 1873. His family moved to Lille soon after. While growing up in Lille he met Th√©r√®se of Lisieux who had come to Lille on a visit with her family. They were both the same age (seven) at the time. Joseph Lelen, a French citizen, served in the French Army until 1894, together with author Hilaire Belloc, then a friend. Commitment to religious life He joined the Sulpician Order and became a Roman Catholic priest upon ordination at Notre Dame Cathedral of Paris on September 24, 1898. Father Lelen came to America in 1899 after working in France with the Sulpicians. He taught at Dunwoodie Seminary in Yonkers, New York. Later he traveled to France, then returned to North America serving in Canada and eventually New Orleans. The climate in New Orleans did not agree with Fr. Lelen and he requested and was granted assignment in Covington, Kentucky in 1907. His first assignment was as chaplain of Good Shepherd Convent in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. He became editor of \\"The Christian Year\\" the diocesan newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington in January 1912. He then served as pastor of St. Paul parish, Florence, Kentucky from 1915 to 1918. Father Lelen became pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Falmouth, Kentucky in 1918. He continued to write many books, pamphlets, magazine articles and newspaper articles. He was a regular contributor to The Falmouth Outlook, the weekly paper of Falmouth, Kentucky. He continued in this pastorate until he retired in 1954. Author and correspondent In 1952 his translation \\"The Confessions of St. Augustine\\", from the original Latin, was published in English, one of the first in this language. He was a prolific author of prayer books throughout his life. He corresponded with and met many notable figures, including Margaret Mitchell, Alice Brown, William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Jules Verne and Clare Boothe Luce. Upon his 1954 retirement he lived at the Glenmary Missionaries in Cincinnati. In September, 1963 the Papal Cross (Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice) bestowed by Pope Paul VI was granted to Father Lelen on the occasion of his 65th anniversary of his ordination. \\"The Cross of Honor\\" as it is known is bestowed upon laypersons and clergy who have given exceptional service to the Church. The medal hangs upon a gold and white ribbon. He died in Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio on May 23, 1964.

Mission  DLF's mission is to enable new research and scholarship of its members, students, scholars, lifelong learners, and the general public by developing an international network of digital libraries. DLF relies on collaboration, the expertise of its members, and a nimble, flexible, organizational structure to fulfill its mission. To achieve this mission, DLF: * Supports professional development and networking of members * Promotes open digital library standards, software, interfaces, and best practices * Leverages shared actions, resources, and infrastructures * Encourages the creation of digital collections that can be brought together and made accessible across the globe * Works with the public sector, educational, and private partners * Secures and preserves the scholarly and cultural record  History  The Digital Library Federation was formed on May 1, 1995 by twelve academic libraries, the New York Public Library, U.S. Library of Congress, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, and the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA). The purpose of the organization was to create a distributed, open, digital library. In September 1995, CPA received a nine-month planning grant from IBM for $100,000 on behalf of DLF to support the preparation of a technological and policy proposal with specific guidelines for creating and maintaining a national digital library. Over the next nine months, DLF convened a Planning Task Force to establish working groups to consider the key technical, financial, and organizational issues to forming a national digital library, resulting in three areas of focus in which DLF could play a role in building a digital library infrastructure: discovery and retrieval, rights and economic models, and archiving. A report was issued to IBM on June 1, 1996. Many of the DLF's early efforts formed around defining and elaborating technical architectures for digital libraries. This work focused on interoperability and metadata standards, and work was conducted intensively by the relatively small cadre of persons from the first institutions, most on a core \\"technical architecture committee\\" in DLF. For example, an early initiative led by one member of the committee, Bernie Hurley, was the articulation of an SGML DTD for encoding information about digital objects. That work, MOA2, ultimately evolved into METS. Similarly, in the area of interoperability, much of the early interest in interoperability moved form a focus on the Z39.50 protocol to work on Open Access Initiatives and OAI-PMH. DLF began under the wing of the Council on Library and Information Resources, but spun off into its own group after a few years. It was absorbed back into CLIR in 2010.  Organization  DLF has 190 members as of spring 2019. Members include larger research institutions in North America, small liberal arts colleges and their libraries, public libraries, museums, and cultural heritage organizations, but organizations such as the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) research library, and Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) are also members. The program is staffed by employees of the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The DLF program is governed by the CLIR board and a DLF advisory committee drawn from member institutions. Most of the group's activities are conducted by fellows and staff from member institutions who volunteer to coordinate a particular project or plan forum activities.  Programs and activities = General activities = DLF initiatives change with needs; as some projects come to fruition or find new support, the DLF invests in others, staying flexible as a catalyst for experiment and change. For example, the DLF has promoted work on the following: * Digital library structures, standards, preservation, and use * Archives for electronic journals * Online collections for use in teaching * Internet services that expand access to resources of use to scholars * Assessments of the future roles of libraries. = Conferences = Forums are convened annually and include a number of digital library practitioners from the member institutions and elsewhere. The forums serve as meeting places, market places, and congresses. As meeting places they provide an opportunity for the DLF Board, advisory groups, initiatives to conduct their business and to present their work to the broader membership. As market places, they provide an opportunity for member organizations to share experiences and practices with one another and in this respect support a broader level of information sharing between professional staff. As congresses, Forums provide an opportunity for the DLF to continually review and assess its programs and its progress with input from the broader membership community. = Contributions = DLF has played a significant role in the origin or evolution of these digital library initiatives: * ARTstor * Archivists' Toolkit * Cataloging Cultural Objects * DLF/OCLC Registry of Digital Masters * DPLA - The Digital Public Library of America * Global Digital Format Registry * Making of America * METS * OCKHAM Initiative * OAI * SUSHI Protocol (ANSI/NISO Z39.93) * TEI Lite  References  External links  * American digital libraries Library consortia ","title":"Digital Library Federation"},{"id":"21276785","text":"The World Education Forum is a premium body comprising representatives of major organisations involved in education and related activities across the world.

It was first serialized in IF magazine (May‚ÄìJuly, 1967) and first published in novel form in 1967. It was also known under the title Spaceman. Synopsis Down-on-his-luck college dropout Billy Danger shelters from a sleet storm in what he thinks is a corn silo, but which turns out to be a spaceship containing a party of upper-class hunters from the planet Zeridajh, from half- way across the Milky Way. They take him on as a gun-bearer, and after landing on a desert world, the two men are both killed, and Billy is left alone with the beautiful Princess Raire. Since only the men knew the password to re-enter the spaceship they are effectively marooned. They signal for help via a radio they find in an abandoned spaceship that has crashed into a nearby ravine. Unfortunately some none-too-friendly aliens answer the call and kidnap the princess, and then, clumsily, try to kill Billy. He survives, and is nursed back to health by a giant tabby cat who survived from the derelict spaceship. A more friendly bunch of aliens arrive and give him a ride to another planet, where he sets out in his quest to find the princess. He has many adventures across the galaxy, including being captured on a spying mission, where he is forced to ransom his friends' lives by giving up his right eye. Eventually he finds the princess, but she has been enslaved. He buys her freedom, and that of another human, but the human slave kidnaps the princess and he is forced into slavery himself.

In the United States, from the 1950s until the 1990s, tobacco industries wielded great influence in shaping public opinion on the health risks of tobacco. Despite the efforts of public health advocates, scientists, and those affected by smoking, both Congress and courts favored the tobacco industry in policy and litigation. It was not until the 1990s when public health advocates had more success in litigating against tobacco industries, including the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between major tobacco companies and 46 state attorneys general. Although public opinion in the United States on cigarette smoking is more unfavorable, many large tobacco companies continue to find success internationally. As of 2018, 169 states have signed the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which governs international tobacco control. However, many nations have had difficulty complying with the FCTC, with higher rates of smoking especially in developing nations. There are currently close to one billion smokers worldwide. Taxation Tobacco has been taxed by state governments in the United States for decades. The cumulative revenue of US tobacco taxation exceeded $32 billion in 2010, creating a major source of income for government. The Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act of 1978, a law which makes cigarette smuggling a felony punishable by up to 5 years in federal prison, is used to prosecute smugglers who avoid paying the taxes on cigarettes. The proposed Stop Tobacco Smuggling in the Territories Act of 2013 (H.R. 338; 113th Congress), if it passes during the 113th United States Congress, would update the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act to include American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, which were previously not covered by the law. However, although the bill passed the House, it died in the Senate. Cigarette advertising In several parts of the world, tobacco advertising and sponsorship of sporting events is prohibited. The ban upon tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the European Union in 2005 prompted Formula One management to look for venues that permit display of the livery of tobacco sponsors, and led to some of the races on the calendar being cancelled in favor of more 'tobacco-friendly' markets. As of 2007, only one Formula One team, Scuderia Ferrari, received sponsorship from a tobacco company; Marlboro branding appeared on its cars in three races (Bahrain, Monaco, and China), all in countries lacking restrictions on tobacco advertising. Advertising billboards for tobacco are still in use in Germany, while the majority of EU member states have outlawed them. MotoGP team Ducati Marlboro received sponsorship from Marlboro, its branding appearing at races in Qatar and China. On 1 July 2009, Ireland prohibited the advertising and display of tobacco products in all retail outlets. Lobby Major tobacco lobbying companies include Altria Group (the parent company of Philip Morris USA), Philip Morris International, and Reynolds American. = 20th Century = A. Bradford Hill, alongside Richard Doll, published several studies demonstrating a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. In the early 1950s, several studies demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Worried that these studies would negatively impact tobacco consumption, tobacco companies met together and hired the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton. In 1954, tobacco companies published a joint press release called \\"A Frank Statement\\", which cast doubt on studies linking smoking and cancer and called for more research. In addition, these tobacco industries formed the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which challenged the science of smoking's relation to cancer. TIRC's first director was Clarence Cook Little, whose background in genetic science gave TIRC the appearance of scientific credibility. Other scientists who were skeptical of the causal link between smoking and cancer also joined the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) of TIRC, although many of these scientists expressed concern over TIRC's strong denial of the link between cancer and smoking. In 1964, the Surgeon General released a report confirming the causal link between smoking and cancer. Tobacco industries formed the Tobacco Institute, a trade association that acted as a lobby for tobacco industries in Congress. This lobbying was generally successful, as the tobacco industry was well-funded and southern states relied on tobacco revenues. For example, after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) mandated warning labels on cigarette packages, tobacco companies successfully requested Congressional regulation in place of FTC regulation. The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) of 1965 originally required cigarette warning labels to include a warning of cancer, but this was removed from the final bill. Although tobacco companies had considerable influence throughout the twentieth century, anti-tobacco advocates also had some successes. In 1967, anti-tobacco advocates successfully argued that the fairness doctrine of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated time for anti-smoking advertisements equal to time allotted for smoking advertisements. In 1998, amidst growing evidence against tobacco companies, especially after the release of several industry documents, and growing public attitudes against smoking, states and tobacco companies entered a Master Settlement Agreement. This settlement included payments to states, restrictions on advertisements, and free access to internal industry research, although some have criticized the settlement for shielding the industry from future lawsuits, granting a monopoly to the largest tobacco companies, creating \\"client states\\" dependent on settlement payments, and shifting the cost of cigarettes to individual smokers rather than companies. In addition, tobacco companies have expanded their operations abroad, arguably undermining the impact of the settlement. = 21st Century = Tobacco companies continue to play a large role in politics, although not as extensively as in the twentieth century. In 1990, the contributions of tobacco lobbies totalled to over $70 million. In 2017, tobacco lobbies paid $21.8 million. Tobacco companies tend to donate more to Republican candidates, contributing over $50 million since 1990 to Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence. Proposals for relaxed electronic cigarette regulation, such as the Cole-Bishop Amendment in the 2017 omnibus bill and FDA Deeming Authority Clarification Act of 2017, have emerged, none have passed yet. In 2006, courts ordered tobacco companies to run anti-smoking advertisements, but tobacco companies delayed this order through multiple appeals until 2017. As of 2017, tobacco companies must now run advertisements detailing the negative health impacts of smoking for a year. Litigation The lawsuits brought against various tobacco manufacturers, attempting to hold them responsible for wrongful death, injury, or medical expenses related to cigarette smoking and other tobacco use. Cases have been brought both by individual plaintiffs and by government officials, including U.S. State Attorney General. Punitive damages for the plaintiff have often been awarded as a result of a successful litigation. However, the vast majority of court decisions have been in favor of the defendant tobacco companies.Stephen E. Smith, \\"'Counterblastes' to Tobacco: Five Decades of North American Tobacco Litigation\\", Windsor Review of Legal and Social Issues, vol. 14, Nov. 2002, pp. 1‚Äì32. =History= The history of tobacco litigation in the United States can be divided into three waves: (1) from 1954 to 1973, (2) from 1983 to 1992, and (3) from 1994 until today. During the first two waves, tobacco companies had enormous success, winning all but one of their cases, with the only case they lost, Cipollone v. Liggett, being reversed. During the first wave, a growing abundance of evidence linked tobacco to death and disease. Individual smokers filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry, claiming negligence in manufacturing and advertising, breach of warranty, and product liability. However, the tobacco industry responded by challenging the science of smoking causing disease and claiming that smokers assumed any risks. During the second wave, plaintiffs charged tobacco companies with failure to warn about the addiction and disease risk of cigarettes and strict liability. The tobacco companies argued that people assumed the risks of smoking and that federal laws preempted state laws, which the lawsuits were filed under. In addition, the tobacco industry poured a massive amount of money into these cases, trying to overwhelm plaintiffs with legal costs. An internal memorandum by an attorney for the RJ Reynolds tobacco company described their strategy as, ‚ÄúTo paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by spending all of our money, but by making that other son of a bitch spend all [of] his.‚Äù The third wave of tobacco litigation was much more successful for plaintiffs, with plaintiffs winning 41% of cases between 1995 and 2005. It also saw a greater number and variety of lawsuits overall. State attorney generals charged the tobacco industry of using misleading marketing, targeting children, and concealing the health effects of smoking. These cases resulted in settlements across all fifty states in the United States. Recently, there has been mixed success for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation. In Florida, a large class action lawsuit was rejected, because the court argued that each individual case must be proven. As a result, thousands of individual lawsuits were filed against tobacco companies, but many of these verdicts are now in appeal. Smokers have also challenged light cigarettes, alleging that tobacco companies falsely advertise light cigarettes as healthier. Tobacco companies argue that 'light' refers to the taste, not the filters, and also used preemption arguments.Edward L. Sweda, Jr., Mark Gottlieb & Christopher N. Banthin, Tobacco Control Legal Consortium, Light Cigarette Lawsuits in the United States: 2007 (2007). Although the Supreme Court ruled in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good (2008) that federal law does not preempt certain state consumer protection laws, no courts have ruled on these laws being violated. =Significant cases= * 1992: In Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. the US Supreme Court held that the Surgeon General's warning did not preclude suit by smokers against tobacco companies on several claims, and that the federal laws on tobacco regulation aren't worded to override state laws. * 1995: The Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) upheld the constitutionality of the federal Tobacco Products Control Act, but struck out the provisions which prevented tobacco advertising and unattributed health warnings. * March 2001: The US Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court's ruling that the Food and Drug Administration could not class tobacco as a pharmaceutical, so could not control its production through the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. (FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.) * June 2002: A District Court in Kansas awarded $15 million in punitive damages against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco after calling the company's conduct \\"highly blameworthy and deserving of significant punishment.\\" (David Burton vs. R.J. Reynold's Tobacco) * June 2002: A Miami jury held three cigarette companies liable for $37.5 million in a lawsuit involving an ex‚Äìsmoker who lost his tongue to tobacco‚Äìrelated oral cancer. (Lukacs vs. Philip Morris) * October 2002: A Los Angeles jury issued $28 billion in punitive damages against Philip Morris. This was later reduced to $28 million. (Betty Bullock vs. Philip Morris) * 2003: A Madison County, Illinois jury awarded $10.1 billion against the tobacco company Philips Morris for deceptive cigarette advertising in a class action led by attorney Stephen Tillery (Price v. Philip Morris).Korein Tillery will retry light cigarettes case against Philip Morris, Market Watch, October 25, 2011 * 2004: A New York jury issued $20 million to the wife of a long-term smoker who died of lung cancer at the age of 57. This was the first time that a New York court had held a tobacco company liable for an individual smoker's death. (Gladys Frankson vs. Brown and Williams Tobacco Corp) * 2005: In Imperial Tobacco v. British Columbia the Supreme Court of Canada found that the provincial Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act, which allowed the government to sue tobacco companies, was constitutionally valid. * 2007: Philip Morris USA v. Williams led to the US Supreme Court to tell the Oregon Court of Appeals to reconsider its earlier judgment and lower the case's punitive damages amount in light of State Farm v. Campbell. The appeals court ultimately upheld their original damages. * 2008: The Altria Group v. Good US Supreme Court case said that state law is not preempted by a federal law regarding cigarette advertisement regulations. =Grounds of claims= ; Civil Rights: Tobacco companies have marketed menthol cigarettes specific to African Americans; groups have pursued civil rights remedies in court.Jain, S. Lochlann \\"'Come Up to the Kool Taste': African American Upward Mobility and the Semiotics of Smoking Menthols\\" Public Culture 15(2), Spring 2003. http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/public_culture/v015/15.2jain.pdf ; Design defects : Claims of design defects allege that tobacco companies designed tobacco products with additional adverse health risks. Examples of design defects include cigarettes that increase addiction risks and deliberately choosing to not develop less harmful cigarettes. : In response, tobacco companies have argued that they have not intentionally made cigarettes more dangerous, but instead carefully and thoughtfully design the least hazardous tobacco product for smokers. ; Strict liability : Strict liability means that tobacco companies must be responsible for possible damages or injuries resulting from cigarettes. ; Product liability : The liability of the product lies on the manufacturer. ; Depriving of health hazards information : Lawsuits against tobacco companies have asserted that tobacco companies mislead the public on the risks of smoking, environmental smoke, and nicotine addiction. =Defenses= ; Volenti non fit injuria : Volenti non fit injuria, or \\"to a willing person, no injury is done\\", is a common law doctrine which states, when applied to these cases, that there is no damage to someone who willingly places themselves in a position where they are negatively affected by tobacco consumption. ; Contributory negligence : Contributory negligence is a common law defense to a claim based on negligence, that before the cases, the adverse effects were unknown. This has been one of the commonly used defences. Most of them will assert that it was the plaintiff himself that has contributed to his own injury as he has prior knowledge of the harm associated with tobacco smoking. Tobacco advertising fails to influence non-smokers :Tobacco companies argue that tobacco advertisements are intended for smokers choosing between brands of tobacco products. Moreover, advertising has a limited effect on influencing smoking behavior. Therefore, tobacco advertisements do not play a role in driving non-smokers to smoke. Epidemiology cannot show causation :Tobacco companies claim that epidemiological evidence cannot show direct causation in individuals. This reasoning was used in the 2005 McTear v. Imperial Tobacco Limited case in Scotland, arguing that the plaintiffs could not reasonably prove that the plaintiffs‚Äô smoking caused lung cancer. In addition, tobacco companies challenge the way epidemiological evidence is collected.  Tobacco politics and litigation outside of the United States = Introduction = Litigation also continues in several countries outside the United States. Citing third party reimbursement, several countries, such as Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, have filed lawsuits both in the United States and in their own courts against tobacco industries. Individual suits have also been filed in a multitude of countries, including Argentina, Finland, France, Japan, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey. = Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) = The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) represents an important landmark in international tobacco control governance. The treaty was formalized on February 27, 2005, and currently, 169 states have signed the treaty. The United States is one of seven countries that have signed but not ratified the FCTC. The FCTC encourages states to reduce tobacco production and use through measures like cigarette taxes, restrictions on advertising, clean air controls, plain packaging and tobacco smuggling legislation. Initially, the concept of an international tobacco control treaty received little enthusiasm. However, in 1998, Gro Harlem Brundtland became director general of the WHO, creating momentum for the FCTC. Organizations and events within the United States also played a key role in the creation and adoption of the FCTC globally. The American Public Health Association helped support the development of the FCTC, while the wave of successful tobacco litigation helped generate interest in tobacco control. In addition, the FCTC lacks mandates on transboundary tobacco issues. As a result, implementation of the treaty fell short, despite widespread ratification. In response, organizations such as Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation increased their philanthropic contributions to the WHO. This resulted in the creation of MPOWER, which focuses on implementation of FCTC. = Australia = In Australia, tobacco companies have faced several lawsuits, although not to the scale of litigation in the United States. In 1991, the Federal Court found advertisements denying environmental smoke to be misleading. In the 1999 case Nixon v. Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd, plaintiffs claimed tobacco companies misled them on the risks of smoking, although Courts ruled the case could not continue as representative proceedings (similar to class action lawsuits in the United States). Personal injury cases are less common in Australia, as unsuccessful plaintiffs must pay the legal fees of the defendant, less profit incentives exist for Australian lawyers, and momentum from successful tobacco litigation has not been generated. McCabe v British American Tobacco (2002) was the first personal injury case outside the United States to win a verdict against a tobacco company. The plaintiff Rolah McCabe, who was diagnosed with lung cancer, claimed British American Tobacco Australia misled her in estimating the risk for smoking cigarettes. The verdict was later overturned, although McCabe died before the court proceedings finished. This case has been influential in litigation and legislation concerning document destruction, as British American Tobacco destroyed several documents in this case. In 2005, a court-enforceable settlement between the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and Philip Morris (Australia) Limited, British American Tobacco Limited, and Imperial Tobacco Australia Limited, was reached. The companies agreed to stop describing cigarettes as ‚Äúlight‚Äù and ‚Äúmild‚Äù and provide $9 million for corrective advertising, in exchange for the ACCC to no longer pursue certain legal action against the companies. Afterwards, the companies started to describe cigarettes with terms such as ‚Äúrich‚Äù, ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, ‚Äúfine‚Äù, ‚Äúultimate‚Äù, ‚Äúrefined‚Äù, and ‚Äúchilled‚Äù. Tobacco companies have not been the only defendants in tobacco litigation. In cases regarding environmental smoke, the defendants are often the owners or managers of locations where environmental smoke occurs. In Meeuwissen v Hilton Hotels of Australia Pty Ltd (1997), the plaintiff argued environmental smoke in a nightclub constituted unlawful discrimination based on disability, and was awarded $AU2000 in compensation. Aside from disability discrimination, environmental smoke lawsuits have also cited common law negligence, occupational health and safety law, and occupiers‚Äô law. The result of such litigation has been increased bans on smoking in the workplace and certain public places. Tobacco companies have also initiated litigation domestically and internationally, claiming government measures against tobacco have infringed on their commercial rights. In 2011, the Australian government introduced plain packaging legislation. Philip Morris Asia Limited challenged this directive under a bilateral trade agreement with Hong Kong, but did not succeed. Cuba, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Indonesia also filed a World Trade Organization complaint, but the WTO upheld the plain packaging law in 2017. = China = Although China faces many tobacco-related health problems, with over 1.2 million tobacco-related deaths per year, the government has had a limited response. The tobacco industry provides 7 to 10 percent of tax revenue for the government, while also providing many jobs in agriculture, sales, and other businesses. In addition, the government considers anti- smoking measures as potentially destabilizing, given the resentment and unrest it could cause. The tobacco industry and some bureaucratic institutions oppose anti-smoking measures. In China, the tobacco industry is heavily monopolized. The largest firm is China National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC), which is also the world's largest tobacco firm and makes up about 32 percent of the global market. The CNTC is described as a ‚Äúde facto industrial and business agency‚Äù as it is also run by the national regulatory agency, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA). Some have criticized the STMA/CNTC for the overlap between government and business (zhengqi bu fen). Some regional governments also oppose tobacco control policies. For example, in Yunnan Province, tobacco is the largest industry, with tobacco taxes supplying one half of its local government revenue. Other provinces like Guizhou, Henan, and Sichuan, also rely heavily on revenue from tobacco production. The Chinese government has implemented some tobacco control measures. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the national government and local governments implemented various bans on smoking in public places. In 2005, the PRC ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In 2009, the government raised the tobacco consumption tax, although this did not reduce smoking, as the government required wholesale and retail prices to remain the same. In 2011, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed the 12th Five-Year Plan, which included a call to completely ban smoking in public places. However, many of these laws have been weakly enforced. = Japan = After the Meiji Restoration in the nineteenth century, Japan began taxing tobacco. Historically, tobacco revenue has been used to fund military endeavors. In the late nineteenth century, following the deficits from the Sino-Japanese War and in preparation for the Russo-Japanese War, the government imposed a monopoly over tobacco production. In 1985, this monopoly was privatized into what is now Japan Tobacco (JT), although the government still exhibits great influence over and benefits from tobacco tax revenue. In 1999, Japan Tobacco created its international branch, Japan Tobacco International (JTI). JTI is now the world's third largest transnational tobacco corporation (TTC). In 2014, the Tokyo High Court ruled that there was not definitive scientific evidence that passive smoking causes cancer, although the evidence they were presented was discredited outside of Japan. In 2017, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games hosted in Tokyo, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry called to ban smoking in public facilities. Japan has some of the least stringent tobacco control measures in the world. The food service industry, which includes public premises like restaurants and bars, strongly opposed this measure. In 2018, the plan for a total smoking ban was revised to include certain exceptions, such as separate rooms for smokers in restaurants in exempting ‚Äúsmall-scale‚Äù establishments. Nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are only permitted as medicinal products and no e-cigarettes have been approved. Regular cigarettes, and other tobacco products however (which are often considered to be more harmful to health) are then again not prohibited.Tobacco Control Laws: Japan = Russia = In Russia, smoking is very prevalent, with tobacco industries wielding great influence in Russian politics. Several Russian Duma members have also worked within the tobacco industry. After a protest caused by cigarette shortages in 1990, transnational tobacco companies began to invest in the Russian tobacco market, particularly in production. This growth in industry has been accompanied by an increase in smoking, and Russia has the highest rates of smoking in Europe. Although the Russian government has attempted to implement tobacco prevention and control programs, most of these have had limited success. In the mid-1990s, the Federal Ministry of Health recommended several tobacco control measures, but failed to provide funding for their enactment. In 1999, the Duma introduced national tobacco control legislation. However, this legislation was substantially watered down after measures like limitations on advertisement were removed. In 2006, the Duma passed limited tobacco advertising regulations, which still allowed for small warnings on cigarette packs without graphics. In 2010, Prime Minister Putin approved the ‚ÄúConcept of the Government Policy on Combating Tobacco Use for 2010-2015.‚Äù Although the concept set forth several goals and concrete policy suggestions, such as complete bans on all tobacco advertising, it was not legally binding. When the Ministry of Health and Social Development (MoHSD) proposed tobacco legislation based on the concept, the bill was suspended within two days. Although many Russian representatives helped develop the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Russia was one of the last countries to sign the FCTC. In 2017, the Ministry of Health proposed a cigarette ban that would apply to all born after 2014, although some have expressed concern that a ban would result in a cigarette black market. =UK= In England, cigarette and tobacco displays in supermarkets are banned.

He served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and of the United States Circuit Courts for the Ninth Circuit and previously was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and a Justice of the Supreme Court of California. Early life Ross was born in Belpre on June 30, 1845, in Culpeper County, Virginia. He attended the Virginia Military Institute, leaving school twice during the Civil War to assist the Confederate States Army and then returning for further training, graduating in 1864.Oscar T. Shuck, History of the Bench and Bar of California, page 657. Legal and judicial career in California In 1868, Ross moved to Los Angeles, California, and joined the law office of his uncle, Cameron E. Thom, a prominent lawyer and former state senator who would later serve as Mayor of Los Angeles. After studying law at Thom's office for two years, Ross was admitted to the bar of the district court. In 1875, he joined the bar of the state supreme court, having already become wealthy and famous through his partnership with his uncle. In October 1879, when adoption of a new constitution required elections for all court seats, Ross was elected to the Supreme Court of California and began his term on January 5, 1880. A Democrat, he was elected at age 34 without having served on the bench of any lower court. The newly elected justices drew lots to determine their length of term, and both he and John Sharpstein drew three-year terms. In October 1882, Ross was re-elected on the Democratic ticket along with Sharpstein to a 12-year term on the high court. In November 1885, he announced his plans to resign to return to private practice with law partner Stephen M. White effective January 1, 1886. Instead, Ross delayed his resignation and stayed on the court until October 1, 1886. Federal judicial service Ross was nominated by President Grover Cleveland on December 16, 1886, to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, to a new seat authorized by 24 Stat. 308. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 13, 1887, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on March 5, 1895, due to his elevation to the Ninth Circuit. Ross was nominated by President Cleveland on February 19, 1895, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Ninth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 28 Stat. 665. He was confirmed by the Senate on February 22, 1895, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals. He assumed senior status on May 31, 1925. His service terminated on December 10, 1928, due to his death in Los Angeles. Bequest creating Ross Essay Contest In his will, Ross bequeathed $100,000 to endow an essay contest administered by the American Bar Association.See Bruce I.

It was previously classified as Beloperone flaviflora. The species is endemic to the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean republic of Trinidad and Tobago where it is only known from near the peaks of mountains in the Northern Range. It is an erect herb with leaves up to long. It is suffering from habitat degradation and has become increasingly rare, being now rated as \\"critically endangered\\". Distribution Specifically, it is only known from several locations in the Heights of Aripo, one of the highest points in Trinidad's Northern Range. Justicia flaviflora is an erect herb with leaves up to 27.5 centimetres (11 inches) long and around 11 centimetres (4 inches) broad. The corolla of the flower is cylindrical, about 2.8 cm (1.1 in) long. Taxonomy The species was originally described as Beloperone flaviflora in 1922 by the English botanist William Bertram Turrill based on collections made by Robert O. Williams in the same year. Turrill considered it a close relative of a Mexican species, Beloperone tenera (now J. tenera). Its currently accepted name, Justicia flaviflora was coined by the American botanist Dieter C. Wasshausen in 1995, reflecting the predominant view that the members of the genus Beloperone should actually be considered members of the genus Justicia. As of 2006, the species was last known to have been collected in 1993. Collections of J. flaviflora are known to exist in the herbaria of the British Museum and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Status Although Justicia flaviflora is not listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List, the authors of a 2008 assessment of the endemic plant species of Trinidad and Tobago considered the species critically endangered. Reasons cited for this were the fact that the species is known only from only two localities, and that this area is shrinking. The species is experiencing a severe case of habitat degradation. The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria published in 2001 specifically states that a species is considered critically endangered if it has limited geographic range both in the extent of the species' occurrence (criterion B1) and the area (criterion B2) that the individuals occupy within that range.

It is known by a variety of common names, such as the candlestick fungus, the candlesnuff fungus, carbon antlers, or the stag's horn fungus. The fruit bodies, characterized by erect, elongated black branches with whitened tips, typically grow in clusters on decaying hardwood. The fungus can cause a root rot in hawthorn and gooseberry plants. Taxonomy Xylaria hypoxylon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1745,Linnaeus C. (1745).

Description Fruit bodies (ascocarps) are cylindrical or flattened with dimensions of tall √ó 2‚Äì8 mm thick. The erect ascocarps are often twisted or bent, and typically sparsely branched, often in a shape resembling a stag's antlers. Specimens found earlier in the season, in spring, may be covered completely in asexual spores (conidia), which manifests itself as a white to grayish powdery deposit. Later in the season, mature ascocarps are charcoal-black, and have minute pimple-like bumps called perithecia on the surface. These are minute rounded spore bearing structures with tiny holes, or ostioles, for the release of sexual spores (ascospores). The perithecia are embedded in the flesh of the ascocarp, the stroma, which is tough, elastic, and white. Within the perithecia, the asci are 100 √ó 8 ¬µm. Ascospores are kidney-shaped, black, and smooth, with dimensions of 10‚Äì14 √ó 4‚Äì6 ¬µm.

It is native throughout the range of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, growing between elevation in shaded arboreal forests and on limestone slopes. Description Salvia interrupta has apple-green three-lobed leaves of various sizes, with short white hairs on the underside, with the plant appearing to grow in a basal rosette. The flower stalks grow to 2 ft, with verticils of 5-10 flowers growing on small peduncles that are widely spaced along the stalk. The spacing explains the plant's epithet, \\"interrupta\\", and contributes to the elegance of the flower stalk. The nearly 4 cm flowers are large and violet, with a wide lower lip that has at its center two distinct white lines leading insects to the pollen and nectar glands inside. The stalks are square when young, becoming round when mature, with two distinct dark purple-brown lines running up the length of the stalk. The plant is sometimes confused with Salvia candelabrum, which has undivided leaves as compared to S. interrupta, due to the similarity of the flower stalks. Salvia ringens also looks similar to S. interrupta‚Äî it has longer petioles and repeat blooms more frequently. In cultivation, flowering usually begins in late spring or early summer and repeats heavily in October. The flower stalks last well as cut flowers. In his 1933 classic The English Flower Garden, William Robinson described Salvia interrupta as one of the most beautiful border plants. The dramatic flowering stalks tend to get lost in the midst of other plants, so it is better for the front of borders, where its tidy foliage can be seen when not in bloom. It also works well as a dramatic single specimen in a large pot. History Salvia interrupta was first scientifically described in 1801 by the Danish botanist Peder Kofod Anker Schousboe, who was the Danish consul at Tangier from 1801 to 1832. Schousboe was an avid collector of plants for the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden and described many species from Morocco and Mauritania. Prior to its formal 1801 description, it was first mentioned in an unofficial survey of Moroccan flora circa 1791-1793 by Schousboe. Soon after its discovery, S. interrupta was brought to Europe sometime before 1870. More than a hundred years later, the plant has become widely grown both in North America and continental Europe.

It is native to the Mexican states of Puebla, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz, growing in shady places such as the edge of forests. Its specific epithet, \\"involucrata\\", refers to the prominent flower bracts, which are large and colorful. Description Salvia involucrata grows five feet or taller before it starts blooming in late summer. The plant's flowers and bracts are a reddish, beetroot color. The bracts occur in pairs which envelop three flowers each, falling away as the flowers expand. The plant's leaves are small, flat mid-green, slightly cordate-shaped. Unusually, the leaves' petioles and veins share the flowers' beetroot-reddish hue. Genetically, the species has eleven (11) tetraploidal chromosomes. Cultivation Salvia involucrata and its cultivars 'Bethellii' and 'Boutin' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. 'Bethellii' was introduced in 1881 for its compact habit and large ovoid leaves. Another cultivar, common in France and Britain, is 'Deschamsiana', which was chosen in 1869 for the bright rose color of its inflated flowers. Cultivars that have found popularity in the U.S. include 'Hidalgo', 'El Butano', and 'El Cielo'‚Äîeach named after the place in Mexico where it was collected. Salvia involucrata breeds freely with other Salvia species, resulting in many hybrids at University of California Botanical Garden that show hybrid vigor. Some of these hybrid plants are known to grow up to six feet high, with a longer blooming period. 'Mulberry Jam', a smaller hybrid with upright growth, stronger stems, and continuous blooming from summer to frost was introduced in 1995 by Betsy Clebsch. As a garden plant, it prefers good drainage, half to three-quarter a day of sun, humus enriched soil, and deep watering once a week. Propagation is by division or cuttings, which can be rooted in late summer or early autumn. The plant will grow back from the ground after light freezes. In early spring, it should be pruned back to active nodes a few inches from the crown. In medicine Historically, S. involucrata along with several other members of its genus have been used as a memory-enhancer in traditional herbal medicine. Scientific studies seeking to verify this have shown that extracts of S. involucrata (along with other Salvia species) contained significant amounts of cerebral cortex-relevant compounds, including with those with binding affinity to acetylcholine receptors. The species has also been used at least once in the past as an indicator of carbon dioxide metabolism. In a 1919 study, Salvia involucrata was used to determine the effects of ether on the rate of CO2 respiration on dying cells. The study found that petals of S. involucrata immersed in ether consumed more oxygen as the cells expired.

Issued in 1844, it is her last published work. Published in two volumes, the text describes two European trips that Mary Shelley took with her son, Percy Florence Shelley, and several of his university friends. Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, between 1818 and 1823. For her, Italy was associated with both joy and grief: she had written much while there but she had also lost her husband and two of her children. Thus, although she was anxious to return, the trip was tinged with sorrow. Shelley describes her journey as a pilgrimage, which will help cure her depression. At the end of the second trip, Mary Shelley spent time in Paris and associated herself with the \\"Young Italy\\" movement, Italian exiles who were in favour of Italian independence and unification. One revolutionary in particular attracted her: Ferdinando Gatteschi. To assist him financially, Shelley decided to publish Rambles. However, Gatteschi became discontented with Shelley's assistance and tried to blackmail her. She was forced to obtain her personal letters from Gatteschi through the intervention of the French police. Shelley differentiates her travel book from others by presenting her material from what she describes as \\"a political point of view\\". In so doing, she challenges the early nineteenth-century convention that it was improper for women to write about politics, following in the tradition of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lady Morgan. Shelley's aim was to arouse sympathy in England for Italian revolutionaries, such as Gatteschi. She rails against the imperial rule of Austria and France over Italy and criticises the domination of the Catholic Church. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom. Though Shelley herself thought the work \\"poor\\", it found favour with reviewers who praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's political commentary on Italy was specifically singled out for praise, particularly since it was written by a woman. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Shelley was usually known only as the author of Frankenstein and the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Rambles was not reprinted until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s provoked a wider interest in Shelley's entire corpus. Background=Risorgimento= alt=Black-and-white half-length portrait of a thin, angular balding man From the Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century, Italy was divided into many small duchies and city- states, some of which were autonomous and some of which were controlled by Austria, France, Spain, or the Papacy. These multifarious governments and the diversity of Italian dialects spoken on the peninsula caused residents to identify as \\"Romans\\" or \\"Venetians\\", for example, rather than as \\"Italians\\". When Napoleon conquered parts of Italy during the French Revolutionary Wars (1792‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì15), he unified many of the smaller principalities; he centralised the governments and built roads and communication networks that helped to break down the barriers between and among Italians. Not all Italians welcomed French rule, however; Giuseppe Capobianco founded a secret society called the Carbonari to resist both French rule and the Roman Catholic Church. After Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Congress of Vienna left much of northern Italy in the hands of the Austrians, the Carbonari continued their resistance. The Carbonari led revolts in Naples and Piedmont in 1820 and 1821 and in Bologna, the Papal States, Parma, and Modena in the 1830s. After the failure of these revolts, Giuseppe Mazzini, a Carbonaro who was exiled from Italy, founded the \\"Young Italy\\" group to work toward the unification of Italy, to establish a democratic republic, and to force non-Italian states to relinquish authority on the peninsula. By 1833, 60,000 people had joined the movement. These nationalist revolutionaries, with foreign support, attempted, but failed, to overthrow the Austrians in Genoa and Turin in 1833 and Calabria in 1844. Italian unification, or Risorgimento, was finally achieved in 1870 under the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi.Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 248; Seymour, 487; Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 191. =Travelling and writing=1840 Mary Shelley and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four children died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley \\"a country which memory painted as paradise\\", as she put it.Qtd. in Bennett, 115. The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine and Midas. Mary Shelley had always wanted to return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip.Seymour, 476. The return was painful as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley. In June 1840, Mary Shelley, Percy Florence (her one surviving child), and a few of his friends‚ÄîGeorge Defell, Julian Robinson, and Robert Leslie Ellis‚Äîbegan their European tour. They travelled to Paris and then to Metz. From there, they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Freiburg, Schaffhausen, Z√ºrich, the Spl√ºgen, and Chiavenna.Bennett, 115‚Äì16. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and \\"convulsive shudders\\", symptoms of the meningioma that would eventually kill her.Seymour, 476‚Äì77. This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none of them spoke German, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at Lake Como, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer.Seymour, 477. The group then travelled on to Milan, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via Geneva and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: \\"[in Italy] I might live ‚Äì as once I lived‚Äîhoping‚Äîloving‚Äîaspiring enjoying ... I am placid now, & the days go by ‚Äì I am happy in Percy [Florence's] society & health ‚Äì but no adjuncts ... gild the quiet hours & dulness [sic] creeps over my intellect\\".Qtd. in Sunstein, 353. Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley's prose and began working on another edition of his poetry.Sunstein, 353. alt=Color photograph of Percy Shelley's flat, rectangular, marble tombstone, which reads \\"Percy Bysshe Shelley Cor Cordium Natus IV Aug MDCCXCII [Ob]iit VIII Jul MDCCCXXI[I] Nothing of him that doth fade, / But doth suffer a sea change / Into something rich and strange.\\" 1842‚Äì44 Sir Timothy Shelley gave his grandson Percy Florence an increase in his allowance for his twenty-first birthday, allowing Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to plan a second, longer trip to the Continent.Seymour, 480. In June 1842, Mary Shelley and her son left for a fourteen-month tour. They were accompanied by a few of his friends: Alexander Andrew Knox, a poet and classicist, whom Emily Sunstein, a biographer of Mary Shelley, describes as \\"reminiscent of [Percy] Shelley\\";Sunstein, 356. Henry Hugh Pearson, a musician who had written musical accompaniments for several of Percy Shelley's poems; and Robert Leslie Ellis. Mary Shelley hoped that the easy manners of the other young men would rub off on her awkward son, but instead they became petty and jealous of each other.Seymour, 482‚Äì84; Sunstein, 356. The group visited Li√®ge, Cologne, Coblenz, Mainz, Frankfurt, Kissingen, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Salzburg, the Tyrol, Innsbruck, Riva, Verona, Venice, Florence, and Rome.Bennett, 116. In Rome, Mary Shelley toured museums with the French art critic Alex Rio; Percy Florence was unimpressed with the culture and refused to see the art, infuriating his mother, who spent an increasing amount of her time seeing the country with Knox instead.Seymour, 485; Sunstein, 359. She also paid numerous visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley's grave in Rome.Sunstein, 359. After two months in the Sorrento Peninsula, the group was short of money; Percy Florence and his friends returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris.Sunstein, 359; Seymour, 486. In Paris, Mary Shelley associated with many of the Italian expatriates who were part of the \\"Young Italy\\" movement.Seymour, 487‚Äì88. Her recent travels had made her particularly sympathetic to their revolutionary message. One Italian patriot captivated her in particular: Ferdinando Gatteschi, a smart, handsome, would-be writer. He was young‚Äînot yet 30‚Äîand in exile, following his participation in a failed Carbonari rebellion against Austria in 1830‚Äì31.Sunstein, 360. Shelley was fascinated by Gatteschi; she described him as \\"a hero & an angel & martyr\\".Qtd. in Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 247. Jeanne Moskal, the most recent editor of Rambles, argues that Mary Shelley was attracted to Gatteschi because he resembled Percy Shelley: he was an aristocratic writer who had been cast off by his parents for his liberalism. Moskal argues that \\"the strength of [Shelley's] devotion overturned her previous resolve not to publish again\\".Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 247. At the end of September 1843, Mary Shelley proposed to her publisher, Edward Moxon, that she write a travel book based on her 1840 and 1842 Continental journeys. Interested in assisting Gatteschi, she wrote to Moxon that she was writing \\"for a purpose most urgent & desirable\\".Qtd. in Seymour, 488. She described the work as \\"light\\", \\"personal\\", and \\"amusing\\".Qtd. in Nitchie, 30. Moxon agreed to her proposal and advanced her ¬£60, which she promised to return if fewer than 300 copies of the work were sold.Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 49. (She subsequently gave this same amount to Gatteschi.)Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 250. By the end of January 1844, Shelley had already completed most of the first volume. As Sunstein writes, \\"once started on Rambles, she worked fast and with pleasure, but her head and nerves were bad at times, and her eyes got so weak and inflamed that she wrote only until noon.\\"Sunstein, 362. She left Paris at the end of January and returned to London, still infatuated with Gatteschi. The death of Sir Timothy Shelley, Percy Florence's grandfather, in April 1844, delayed the completion of the work. However, with material from Gatteschi on the Ancona uprising of 1831 and research help from German-speaking friends, Shelley finished.Sunstein, 362‚Äì63; Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 50. The text was largely drawn from correspondence written during her travels to her step- sister Claire Clairmont. Mary Shelley's last published work, which was dedicated to the travel writer and poet Samuel Rogers, came out on 1 August 1844.Nitchie, 29; Sunstein, 365. Despite Mary Shelley's attempts to assist Gatteschi financially, he tried to blackmail her one year later in 1845 using indiscreet letters she had written.Nitchie, 33; Spark, 116. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this.Sunstein, 370. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, but she must have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: \\"[The letters] were written with an open heart ‚Äì & contain details with regard to my past history, which it [would] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light.\\"Qtd. in Seymour, 505. Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was a danger to the state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters.Seymour, 506. On 11 October, Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in outrage that Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that \\"It is an awful power this seizure\\", but she did not regret using it.Qtd. in Sunstein, 371. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent ¬£250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.Spark, 116. Description of text alt=Map showing routes of Shelley's European trips. 1840 trip begins in Brighton, proceeds to Dover, crosses the Channel to Calais, proceeds south to Paris, east Metz, north to Coblenz, east to Frankfurt, south to Freiburg, south to Milan, west to Lyons, and north to Paris and Calais. 1842‚Äì43 trip begins in Southampton, proceeds to London, crosses the Channel to Antwerp, proceeds southeast to Frankfurt, northeast to Berlin, south to Prague, Salzburg, Padua, Rome, and Naples. The two volumes of Rambles are divided into three parts. Part I, which occupies part of the first volume, describes the four-month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence and his university friends in 1840. Parts II and III, which comprise the remainder of the first volume and the entirety of the second volume, describe the fourteen-month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence, Alexander Knox, and other university friends in 1842 and 1843. Part II covers June ‚Äì August 1842 and Part III covers August 1842 ‚Äì September 1843.Smith, 162. All three parts are epistolary and cover a wide range of topics: \\"these include personal narratives of the difficulty of a journey, on her varying health, her budgetary constraint; comments on whether [John] Murray's guide-book advice as to hotels, routes or sights was reliable; her subjective responses to the pictures, statues, cities and landscapes she has seen; reports on her occupations and those of her companions; historical disquisitions on such topics as the Tyrolean struggle against Napoleon, or the origins of the Carbonari; and authoritative analysis of the present and future state of Italian literature.\\"Orr. =Part I= In twelve conversational letters written in the first person, Mary Shelley charts her travels through Europe during 1840 and her reflections on accommodations, scenery, peasants, economic relationships between the classes, art, literature, and memories of her 1814 and 1816 journeys (recorded in History of a Six Weeks' Tour (1817)). In the first letter, she muses on her return to Italy: After landing in France, Shelley continues to happily anticipate her travels and the benefits she will derive from them. Travelling throughout Germany, she complains about the slowness of travel but is pleased to discover that her memories of the Rhine correspond to the reality. Shelley becomes ill in Germany and pauses at Baden-Baden to recover her health. Fearing Percy Florence's (referred to as P‚Äì in the text) love of boats and the water, especially difficult for her after her own husband drowned in a boating accident, she is reluctant to continue to Italy and Lake Como while at the same time desiring to do so. After Shelley recovers her health and spirits, the group proceeds to Italy where she is overcome with nostalgia: Shelley writes of her overwhelming happiness in Italy and her sadness at having to leave it. At the end of September, her money to return to England fails to arrive, so Percy Florence and his friends return without her. Her funds eventually arrive, and she journeys to England alone. In the letters covering her return journey, she describes the sublime scenery through which she travels, particularly the Simplon Pass and waterfalls in Switzerland. =Part II= Correggio's Nativity: \\"When, by the drawing down of the blinds, we were left nearly in darkness, the effect on this picture was miraculous. The child lay in living beams, which seemed to emanate from a focus, and spread rays of light around. I could not have believed that any coloured canvas could have shown such glowing radiance.\\"Shelley, Rambles, 1:244.alt=Nativity scene with angels and cherubs in the upper left-hand corner. Light is emanating from the center of the picture, where the Christ child is positioned, creating shadows and light all around the central group of Mary and the shepherds. Joseph and some animals are in the background. Part II, which consists of eleven conversational letters, covers the first part of Shelley's trip to Europe in 1842, specifically her journey from Antwerp to Prague; the names of her travelling companions are disguised in the text and she rarely alludes to them. She discusses art, sometimes spending several pages describing individual works of art; the benefits and drawbacks of travel by railway versus carriage; the German character and habits of the German people; the history associated with the sights she sees; the scenery and the weather; and her problems as a traveller, for example, her inability to speak German, the dirtiness of the inns, and exorbitant pricing for tourists. Shelley begins this section by musing on the benefits of travel: Briefly passing through a quick succession of German cities by railway, carriage, and boat, the group arrives at Kissingen, where they decide to remain for a month for Shelley to \\"take the cure\\" at the bath. While Shelley believes the waters will be efficacious, she chafes at the restrictions put on those attempting to better their health, such as rising at five or six and eating no delicacies. Her companions are increasingly frustrated by the schedule and the lack of entertainment at the spa. After leaving Kissingen, the group travels through the area around Weimar, seeing sights associated with Martin Luther and the writers Wieland, Schiller, and Goethe. They continue to Berlin and Dresden, where they spend time viewing art and attending the opera, leaving for Prague in August 1842. =Part III= Throughout 23 informal letters, Shelley describes her travels from Prague to southern Italy. She ponders the scenery of the areas she passes through, the history of Germany and Italy (e.g. the Tyrolenese rebellion of April 1809 and the activities of the Carbonari), the art of Baroque and Renaissance Italy, the literature of Italy, and offers opinions on Italy's recent governments, the national character of the German and Italian people, and Catholicism. She also ponders the changes in herself from who she was in the 1820s to who she is in the 1840s, particularly in relation to her grief: Genre=History of the travel narrative= alt=Left-looking half-length painted portrait of a woman in the early stages of pregnancy in a white dress Rambles is a travel narrative, part of a literary tradition begun in the seventeenth century. Through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Continental travel was considered educational: young, aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning European languages abroad and visiting foreign courts.Smith, 155. In the early seventeenth century, however, the emphasis shifted from classical learning to a focus on gaining experience in the real world, such as knowledge of topography, history, and culture. Detailed travel books, including personal travel narratives, began to be published and became popular in the eighteenth century: over 1,000 individual travel narratives and travel miscellanies were published between 1660 and 1800. The empiricism that was driving the scientific revolution spread to travel literature; for example, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu included information she learned in Turkey regarding smallpox inoculation in her travel letters.Smith, 156. By 1742, critic and essayist Samuel Johnson was recommending that travellers engage in \\"a moral and ethical study of men and manners\\" in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography. Over the course of the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour became increasingly popular. Travel to the Continent for Britain's elite was not only educational but also nationalistic. All aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites, with the intention of developing an appreciation of Britain from abroad. The Grand Tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with the intellectual elite, learning about other cultures, and preparing for leadership. However, it was condemned as trivial when the tourist simply purchased curio collectibles, acquired a \\"superficial social polish\\", and pursued fleeting sexual relationships. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Continent was closed to British travellers and the Grand Tour came under increasing criticism, particularly from radicals such as Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, who scorned its aristocratic associations. Young Romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity; they celebrated Madame de Sta—ël's novel Corinne (1807), which depicts proper travel as \\"immediate, sensitive, and above all [an] enthusiastic experience\\".Smith, 157. Travel literature changed in the 1840s as steam-powered ships and trains made Continental journeys accessible to the middle class. Guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller, who was unfamiliar with the tradition of the Grand Tour. The most famous of these was John Murray's Handbook for Travellers on the Continent (1836). By 1848, Murray had published 60 such works, which \\"emphasised comprehensiveness, presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology, history, and art galleries\\".Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 190. Whereas during the Romantic period, travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through the spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions, during the Victorian period, travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a \\"discourse of authenticity\\". That is, they claimed to have experienced the true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal, as opposed to the writers of generic guidebooks, whose response was specifically impersonal.Smith, 163. =Rambles as a travel narrative= Mary Shelley's Rambles both resembles and attempts to separate itself from other travel narratives of the time. Elizabeth Nitchie, in her description of the text, writes, for example, that there is \\"little novelty either in what [Shelley] saw or in her account\\" of the Alps, the Rhine, or Italy,Nitchie, 34. and Moskal notes that Shelley's \\"book participates in the travel-book convention of museum-going\\".Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 254. Although Shelley drew on Murray's famous handbooks and other guidebooks, she specifically attempted to differentiate her work from these. While Murray's guidebooks, for example, were generally apolitical, Shelley argues in the preface to Rambles that the uniqueness of her work is in its portrayal of the Italian people from \\"a political point of view\\".Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 188‚Äì90. Shelley had sold her publisher on the idea of a travel narrative by describing the forthcoming book as \\"light\\" and \\"amusing\\", in the style of Samuel Rogers, whose travel narrative of Italy, accompanied by illustrations by J. M. W. Turner, had been a best-seller in the late 1820s. Rogers's text had avoided politics and focused on picturesque and sublime scenery. Although Shelley dedicated Rambles to Rogers, her preface acknowledged the influence of Lady Morgan, whose travel work, Italy (1821), had been vocal in its criticism of Austria's rule over Italy and had been placed on the papal list of prohibited books.Seymour, 489. To make her politics more palatable to her audience, however, Shelley often uses analyses of literature and art to reinforce her points.Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 197. Shelley's travel narrative, with its \\"informal\\" and \\"subjective\\" focus on her personal experiences, reflects the Romantic emphasis on the individual.Kautz, 167. Unlike Augustus Bozzi Granville's The Spas of Germany (1837), which exudes a Victorian respect for order, political authority, and careful documentation, Shelley focuses on her own reactions to these experiences. She specifically criticises the surveillance and control methods used at the spas she visited, such as the strict dietary regimens and confiscation of letters.Kautz, 170; Dolan, 138‚Äì45. alt=Full-length painted portrait of a woman sitting at a table, writing, and leaning on her hand. There are roses on the table, which is covered with a red, velvet cloth. She is wearing a dark green dress, which reveals her bosom. She has short, brown curls. =Travel narratives by women writers= In choosing to focus her travel narrative on politics, Mary Shelley violated the mid-nineteenth century taboo against women discussing politics, particularly in the public sphere.Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 188‚Äì89. After the mid-1790s (partly as a result of the French Revolution), Britain experienced an \\"antifeminist reaction\\" and women were increasingly discouraged from writing on so-called \\"masculine\\" topics.Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 188. As Moskal explains, there was a \\"massive cultural prejudice that equate[d] masculinity with mobility\\", making travel writing itself a masculine genre; there was even a \\"masculinist aesthetic vocabulary\\".Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 189. Women in the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century wrote travel narratives anyway, but at a cost. Wollstonecraft is described as asking \\"men's questions\\" when she is curious about her surroundings and both Lady Morgan's and Elizabeth Barrett Browning's travel narratives received hostile reviews because they discussed political issues. Both Shelley and her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, exceeded the bounds of what would have been considered \\"the normal purview of the female writer\\" in their travel narratives. Shelley excitedly describes running the rapids in a canoe, for example, and describes the economic status and technological development of the areas she visits. In Paris, she comments on the lack of drains in the streets, in Berlin she visits a steel mill, and throughout the text she describes how the new railways are impacting on travel.Bennett, 116‚Äì17. Shelley's travel narrative is marked by a specific \\"ethic of travel\\"‚Äîthat one must learn to sympathise both physically and emotionally with those one encounters. Her travels are sentimental, and travel writing for her is \\"an exploration of the self through an encounter with the other\\".Schor, 237‚Äì39. Her language even mirrors that of her mother. Wollstonecraft describes the frontier of Sweden as \\"the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty\\" while Shelley describes the Simplon Pass as having \\"a majestic simplicity that inspired awe; the naked bones of a gigantic world were here: the elemental substance of fair mother Earth\\".Qtd. in Dolan, 154. Also like her mother, whose Letters from Sweden was foundational to the writing of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.Seymour, 489‚Äì90; Orr. Themes=Italian politics= alt=Painted portrait of a man seated in a chair, wearing a 19th-century suit, with a black jacket, white shirt, and brown trousers. He has short brown hair and is sitting in front of a brown background. Shelley's stated aim in Rambles is to raise awareness of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence.Bennett, 114. She addresses her readers as English citizens, arguing that they in particular \\"ought to sympathise in [the Italians'] struggles; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England\\".Qtd. in Bennett, 114. On a general level, she articulates an \\"opposition to monarchical government, disapproval of class distinction, abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties\\" similar to that in her historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830).Bennett, 118. The central theme of the second journey is \\"the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism, and the abuses of papal and priestly authority\\".Schor, 244. The solution to Italy's problems, according to Shelley, is neither \\"subjugation\\" nor \\"revolution\\" but rather \\"peaceful mediation\\". Ultimately, it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important, which is why she compares the past and present.Smith, 170. Rambles articulates the \\"Whiggish ideology of political gradualism\\",Smith, 169. and is similar to Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) in that it argues that \\"a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations\\".Schor, 246. Shelley's political frame for her travel narrative was a difficult one to sell to readers. Her audience wanted to support the revolutionaries, especially exiles living among them, such as Mazzini, but they were also fearful of the violence of the Carbonari and its nationalist ideology. They connected nationalism to their historic enemy‚ÄîNapoleonic France. In fact, other travel works published at the time made the argument that Napoleon was responsible for Italian unification.Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 191‚Äì92. Shelley therefore contends that the Risorgimento is primarily inspired by the English and only secondarily by the French (she never names Napoleon).Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 194. Shelley writes a history of Italian nationalism acceptable to English readers, in which the French are the tyrants oppressing the rising nation of Italy, which the Carbonari, although violent, has inspired and created. Her readers could therefore comfortably support Italian nationalism without supporting policies reminiscent of Napoleon.Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 196. She also placed most of her political commentary at the end of the text. As Moskal explains, \\"Shelley creates a structure in which the reader, having already befriended the traveller for some pages, receives this political matter from a friend, not from a stranger.\\"Moskal, \\"Gender and nationalism\\", 195. She also praises Italian literature, particularly the works of Alessandro Manzoni, Pietro Colletta, and Michele Amari, connecting it to Italian nationalism.Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 249‚Äì50. In writing about the Italian situation, Shelley is also advocating a general liberal agenda of rights for the working and middle classes, which had been crushed by the Reign of Terror and Napoleon. British reformers could look with hope towards Italy.Moskal, \\"Travel writings\\", 247. =National character= Throughout Rambles, Shelley describes the national character of the peoples she visits. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness, particularly the peasants: Shelley frequently laments the poor education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt.Nitchie, 39. She does not think much of the Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister Claire Clairmont, \\"I do dislike the Germans‚Äî& never wish to visit Germany again‚Äîbut I would not put this in print‚Äîfor the surface is all I know.\\"Qtd. in Nitchie, 37‚Äì38. Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, except to say that she was impressed by the public education system of Germany.Sunstein, 357. It was how political events affected people that Shelley was most interested in.Bennett, 117. In her History of a Six Weeks' Tour, she had paused several times to discuss the effects of war and she does so again with her description of the Hessians in Rambles:Nitchie, 38. alt=Half-length painted portrait of a woman wearing a black dress, sitting on a red sofa. Her dress is off the shoulder, exposing her shoulders. The brush strokes are broad. =Memory and healing= Shelley's trips to Italy were a way for her to revisit memories of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to \\"expiate\\" her survivor guiltMoskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 252‚Äì53. and Dolan that she needed to recover from a damaging trauma.Dolan, 133‚Äì34. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, \\"Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of my youth lie buried here.\\"Qtd. in Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 252. Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing,Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 253. and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home.Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 255. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically.Kautz, 171‚Äì72; Dolan, 143‚Äì44. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her \\"mind will ... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed\\".Qtd. in Dolan, 136. Shelley's first travel narrative and first published work, History of a Six Weeks' Tour, was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. Rambles, on the other hand, places Mary Shelley at the centre of the narrative.Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 256. It tells the story of \\"the recovery of paradise\\" and the fears of a mother.Orr. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: \\"I was agitated again by emotions‚Äîby passions‚Äîand those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour‚Äîa dread to see her child even at that instant expire‚Äîwhich then occupied me\\".Qtd. in Orr. Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Thomas Holcroft, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal grief is sublime. Reception alt=Page reads \\"Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842, and 1843. By Mrs. Shelley. In Two Volumes. Vol. I. London: Edward Moxon, Dover Street.\\" Of Rambles, Mary Shelley wrote to her friend Leigh Hunt: \\"It seems to me such a wretched piece of work, written much of it in a state of pain that makes me look at its pages now as if written in a dream.\\"Qtd. in Sunstein, 365. She disliked the work, describing it variously as \\"a poor affair\\" and \\"my poor book\\",Qtd. in Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 51. and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts. There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews.Nitchie, 42; Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 56, note 23. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, \\"with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour.\\"Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 53. Reviewers praised the work as \\"entertaining, thoughtful and eminently readable\\", although some thought it was too mournful in places.Seymour, 490. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the Atlas, praised her \\"rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension of all that is good, and beautiful and free\\".Qtd. in Moskal, \\"Introductory note\\", 52. They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling.Nitchie, 29. Shelley's commentary on the social and political life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of \\"a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks\\", a woman with a \\"masculine and original mind\\".Qtd. in Nitchie, 34. Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: \\"With her, as with all women, politics is a matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head ... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman.\\"Qtd. in Moskal, \\"Travel writing\\", 250; see also Seymour, 489. Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley was known as the author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. As late as 1961, Rambles had never been reprintedNitchie, 32. and, as scholar Elizabeth Nitchie explained, \\"scant use has been made of it, and copies of it are rather scarce.\\" However, she argued that some of Mary Shelley's \\"best writing\\" was in Rambles. Novelist Muriel Spark agreed in her book on Shelley, writing that Rambles \\"contains more humour and liveliness than occur in anything else she wrote\\".Spark, 126‚Äì27. In the 1970s, with the rise of feminist literary criticism, scholars began to pay attention to Shelley's other works. With the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s, Mary Shelley's \\"other\\" works‚Äîher short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels‚Äîbegan to be recognised as literary achievements.\\"Introduction\\", The Other Mary Shelley, 3‚Äì9.

It was introduced in 1955 and gained celebrity status during the 1960s as one of the primary basses used by Paul McCartney of The Beatles. History In 1955, Walter H√∂fner designed an electrically amplified, semi-acoustic bass guitar. The hollow body made this style of guitar very light and easy to play, as well as giving it a rich tone similar to that of the traditional double bass. The bass was first shown to the public at the Frankfurt Music Fair in the spring of 1956. A major boost for the bass came in early 1961 when it caught the eye of a young McCartney. In July 1961, before Stuart Sutcliffe decided to leave the Beatles, he briefly lent McCartney his bass guitar until the latter could earn enough to buy a bass guitar of his own in June 1961. McCartney was drawn to the H√∂fner because he felt that its symmetrical shape would mean that playing it left-handed would not look as awkward as using a cutaway guitar designed for a right- handed player: Following the popularity of the Violin Bass created by McCartney, H√∂fner began producing a similar alternative in terms of sound and size with a different shaped body called the H√∂fner 500/2 Club Bass in 1964. Description The H√∂fner 500 is a hollow-body instrument, though lacking soundholes, and is as such commonly referred to as a semi-hollow guitar. It is built using a fairly traditional style, similar to that of an acoustic guitar. It commonly features a thin maple body, a spruce top and a maple neck. The fretboard is traditionally made of rosewood, though more contemporary models have utilized other, similar tonewoods. The H√∂fner 500 features a two-piece bridge system, consisting of an adjustable ebony bridge, and a metal tailpiece. The H√∂fner 500 is also notable for its distinctive control layout, featuring two rotary knobs, as well as three sliding knobs, controlling tone and pickup selection. Earlier models, as well as certain reissues featured the two pickups spaced closely together, up against the heel of the neck, providing a fairly uniform tone, though most recent basses feature a more conventional \\"bridge/neck\\" pickup placement. The earlier models are often referred to as \\"Cavern basses\\", after the Cavern club, where Paul McCartney famously made use of this particular model. > \\"I remember going along there, and there was this bass which was quite > cheap. I couldn't afford a Fender. Fenders even then seemed to be about > ¬£100. All I could really afford was about ¬£30 ... so for about ¬£30, I found > this Hofner violin bass. And to me, it seemed like, because I was left- > handed, it looked less daft because it was symmetrical. Didn't look as bad > as a cutaway which was the wrong way. So I got into that.\\" McCartney eventually acquired two guitars of this model: his original 1961 model, and a 1963 model Afterward, McCartney mainly played the 1963 model, leaving the original as a backup. In 1964, he had his 1961 model refinished in sunburst and had a new updated pickup surround system installed around the original pickups, as one of the plastic original surrounds had snapped (the one nearest the neck). He can be seen using this bass in the \\"Revolution\\" promo video, strangely with the strap attached to the top of the headstock instead of the neck heel strap button. He continued to regularly use the violin bass until 1965 when he switched to a Rickenbacker 4001S; afterwards, he would rotate between the two. On 30 January 1969 the Hofner Bass made its last Beatle appearance at the Apple rooftop concert. Sometime during the recording of Let It Be, the 1961 model was stolen from Abbey Road Studios closet, along with George Harrison's Gretsch Tennessean and Rickenbacker 360/12. McCartney switched to using his 1963 model for the remainder of the album.\\"Let It Be\\" film, Apple Corps. He switched back to the Rickenbacker for the recording of Abbey Road and he even used it with Wings and his solo career. In 1988, while recording the Flowers in the Dirt album, a collaboration with Elvis Costello led to a request from Costello for McCartney to bring the 500/1 back from retirement. As of 2018, he is still in possession of the 1963 bass, and regularly uses it for performances.

Released in 1978, it is Coe's fourth independent album, after Penitentiary Blues, Requiem for a Harlequin and Buckstone County Prison. Nothing Sacred was noted for its profane and sexually explicit lyrics, and was released solely by mail order. Background In the late 1970s, Coe lived in Key West, Florida, and Shel Silverstein played his album Freakin' at the Freakers Ball for Coe, who proceeded to play a series of his own comedic songs. Silverstein encouraged him to record the songs, leading to the production of this album. Nothing Sacred was released as a mail order-only release, initially advertised in the back pages of the biker magazine Easyriders; another album of similar material, Underground Album, followed in 1982. The lyrics of Nothing Sacred are profane, often sexually explicit and describe an orgy in Nashville's Centennial Park and sex with pornographic film star Linda Lovelace. The album also contains a song targeting Anita Bryant, a musician notable for her strong opposition to LGBT rights, specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Miami-Dade County. In the song, bluntly titled \\"Fuck Aneta Briant\\" , Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that \\"In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you\\". The album also has a song criticizing Jimmy Buffett in response to a feud between the two musicians at the time. Buffett had accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of \\"Divers Do It Deeper\\" from Buffett's \\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\", stating \\"I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.\\" Coe wrote the song \\"Jimmy Buffett\\" in response, with Coe suggesting that he and Buffett \\"just both get drunk and screw\\".  Reception  The album was generally criticized as being profane and crude. Neil Strauss described the album's material as \\"among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter.\\" AllMusic, which did not review the album, gave it three out of five stars.

The department is a New York State Accredited Agency. The Southampton Town Police Department is headed by Chief Steven Skrynecki. History The area today known as Southampton Town was settled in 1640. As early as 1641, five marshals were appointed to keep order in the area. This was the beginning of the first organized police protection in the Town of Southampton. In 1922-23, the first two full time constables were hired, at a salary of $30.00 per month plus a fee for each arrest made. This was the first time uniformed patrol officers were seen in the Town of Southampton except for the New York State Troopers. In 1938, the Town of Southampton was separated into the West Precinct and the East Precinct. This improved the efficiency of policing. Patrols were assigned to certain sectors in each precinct area rather than moving throughout the township. The expanding need of police protection in each sector, lead to the appointment of new officers. On July 1, 1951 the Town of Southampton officially established the Southampton Town Police Department. The department initially consisted of 2 Captains, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Sergeant and 4 Police Officers.

The temple has also close ties with Prince Morinaga and the Imperial House. Nichiren, Matsubagayatsu and My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji Kamakura is known for having been in the 13th century the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism. Founder Nichiren was not born there: he came from Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture, and had come to Kamakura because at the time the city was the cultural and political center of the country.Mutsu (1995/2006:258-271) He built himself a hut in the Matsubagayatsu district where three temples (Ankokuron-ji, My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji, and Ch≈çsh≈ç-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honor of being his sole heir. All three say they lie on the very spot where he used to have his hut, however none of them can prove its claims. The Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book to Kamakura commissioned by Tokugawa Mitsukuni in 1685, already mentions a strained relationship between My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji and Ch≈çsh≈ç-ji.Kamiya (2006:141) However, when the two temples finally went to court, with a sentence emitted in 1787 by the shogunate's tribunals My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji won the right to claim to be the place where Nichiren had his hermitage. It appears that Ankokuron-ji did not participate in the trial because the government's official position was that Nichiren had his first hut there, when he first arrived in Kamakura, but that he made another near My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji after he came back from his exile in Izu in 1263. According to the temple's records, Nichiren first settled down here in 1253 and left for Minobu in 1272.Mutsu (1995/2006: 288-291) Every year in August a special ceremony called is held at the temple to commemorate the so-called \\"Matsubagayatsu Persecution\\", an episode in which Nichiren had to hide from his persecutors in the forest near Nagoe, towards Zushi, and was fed with ginger by a white monkey. Not only does the temple claim to have the ruins of the hut in which he used to live, but the very path Nichiren is supposed to have taken to escape to Nagoe leaves the temple from above the hill behind the main hall. History of the temple My≈çh≈ç-ji's mossy stairsThe site was originally occupied by a temple called , which was later transferred to Kyoto.Shirai (1076:293) Its first chief abbots were men from important families, and one of them was Nichiro, better known as Nichiei, the name he assumed when he became a priest, who was an uncle of Ashikaga Takauji and the temple's fifth chief abbot. Nichiei was a natural son of Prince Morinaga,A son of Emperor Go-Daigo imprisoned and executed in Kamakura by Ashikaga Tadayoshi in 1335. and for this reason he rebuilt the temple in 1357 dedicating it to his father.Kamakura Sh≈çk≈ç Kaigijo (2008:108) Nichiei was born from a woman called Minami no ≈ånkata, who attended the prince while he was a prisoner of the Ashikaga in the cave now at Kamakura-g≈´. He and his mother are buried within the temple, while Prince Morinaga's grave is in nearby Nikaid≈ç. Nichiei installed two cenotaphs in memory of his parents on top of the hill behind the main hall. During the Edo period the temple was protected and maintained by the Tokugawa and their vassals. The temple is supposed to have been entrusted to Nichiei by Nichiren himself. Main features Cenotaph to Prince MorinagaThe main hall near the entrance contains, among other things, a small bone fragment said to be a relic of Nichiren and an effigy of Prince Morinaga. Like all other buildings of the complex, it is always closed to the public.A Guide to Kamakura, Myohoji , accessed on January 17, 2008 The building to the left of the main hall is called Daigakuden, and hosts statues of Shaka Nyorai, Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and Inari My≈çjin, the kami of harvests.An example of the co-presence of Indian Buddhism and Japanese kami. For details about the fusion of Buddhism and native Japanese kami beliefs, see the article Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç. The Ni≈ç gate behind them leads to the 50-step mossy stairway which today is the temple's main claim to fame, and which has gained it the above-mentioned nickname \\"Kokedera\\". At the bottom of the stairs are two caves, of which one hosts a statue of Nichiren, while the other is a mausoleum to many of the priests that have lived here.

Early life Garnaev was born on in Balashov to a working-class Russian family. Having moved to the village of Lopasnya (located within present-day Chekhov) in 1934, he went on to complete his third semester at the Podolsk Industrial Technical School in the Moscow oblast before quitting in 1936 due to financial difficulties. He soon got a job at the Lianozovsky Car Repair factory, where he worked while attending the Mytishchi aeroclub. On 17 June 1937 he made his first solo flight before being drafted into the military the next year.  Aviation career  After graduating from the Engels Military Aviation School in 1939 he was sent to a fighter aviation unit in Transbaikalia. From 1940 to 1942 he worked as a flight instructor in Ulan-Ude before returning to a combat regiment. In 1945 he briefly saw combat in the Soviet-Japanese War as a navigator in the 718th Fighter Aviation Regiment, making eleven sorties in a Yak-9 during the conflict. Later that year he was sentenced to a prison in Voroshilov for carelessly handling classified documents, but he was released early in October 1948. He then got a job in 1949 as a technician at the Gromov Flight Research Institute, where he participated in the development of a mid-air refueling system before he was fired in 1950 because of his past conviction. However, he was soon allowed to return to the institute as a test parachutist in January 1951, which led to the kickstart of the test pilot career in December 1951. He went on to conduct a variety of test flights, flying various experimental aircraft and helicopters. In 1957 he became the first person the fly the Rafaelyants Turbolet, and as part of the training of cosmonauts to handle zero-gravity environments in 1960 he flew a modified Tu-104 with Amet-khan Sultan. His life was saved not once but twice by his parachute while conducting test flights, in 1962 during a Mi-6 flight and later in 1964 while flying a Ka-22. Throughout his career he conducted tests on various aircraft including the An-10, Il-28, Ka-22, Mi-3, Mi-4, Mi-6, Mi-10, MiG-15, MiG-21, Tu-14, Tu-16, and Tu-104. Tragically his life was cut short on 6 August 1967; he was killed in the line of duty when piloting a Mi-6PZh helicopter (registration number –°–°–°–†-06174) over France to fight forest forest fires.

Gormiti: The Invincible Lords of Nature (Italian: Gormiti: Gli Invincibili Signori della Natura), later changed to Gormiti: The Lords of Nature Return!, is a toy property based primarily on 2-inch tall non- articulated mini figures with a trading card game play aspect.Gormiti Official Site, Official Giochi Preziosi Gormiti Website. The toys were created in Italy in 2005 by Grani & Partners/Giochi Preziosi.  Toys  Two Gormiti toys: \\"Crabs the Avenger\\" and \\"Mimeticus\\" Gormiti is the name of plastic monsters mini figures, sold together with training cards containing a description of the same character. There are different game modes, and they are used by 4-8 years old children for free play and by adults as collection pieces. According to the mythology, Gormitis are the warriors of the island of Gorm, divided into two great armies (Good and Evil) in a Lord of the Rings-like set. The two armies are in turn divided into various peoples, usually tied to a natural element (People of the Sea, People of Lava ...) that characterizes appearance and powers. The mechanics of sale is similar to that of the figurines: the sale in closed sachets does not allow the choice, and involves the purchase of duplication which in turn feed a phenomenon of exchange. The remarkable success has led to the spread of a large secondary market: figurines, games and other children's products marked \\"Gormiti\\", dedicated magazines, DVDs and a theatrical show. Previously, in the 80s, the Giochi Preziosi distributed static figures of plastic sachets with similar aims, called Exogini, which were also a big hit. In that case it was however an Italianisation of existing static figures inspired by the Kinnikuman manga and anime, based on space wrestler. These figurines were similar to those produced in the USA and Japan, except for the difference of the names of the characters, and the plastic used, harder, and similar to that used for the regular Gormiti. TV series The first television series, Gormiti, was co-produced by Giochi Preziosi and Marathon Media and based on the original Gormiti characters. It was broadcast for the first time on Italia 1 and Canal J from 27 October 2008. It started on October 5, 2009 on Cartoon Network in the United States, and Latin America on Disney XD of the year 2011. It consisted of three seasons, Gormiti: The Lords of Nature Return!, Gormiti: The Supreme Eclipse Era! and Gormiti: The Neorganic Evolution. On January 3, 2011, Giochi Preziosi launched its series in Brazil, where it is the number one show on TV Globinho. Gormiti has been well known among boys in Brazil, long before the television show appeared. There are already over 200 Gormiti licensed toys on the market in Brazil. The series got good ratings worldwide and positive reviews; A second series, Gormiti Nature Unleashed, produced in CGI, began airing in Italy in 2012. Apart from the setting and some characters, it is unrelated to the first TV series. A third series, Gormiti, began airing in 2018.I Gormiti al MipJunior e MipCom Video game Owing to Giochi Preziosi's investment in the platform, Engine Software developed three Gormiti video games for the DigiBlast handheld between 2006 and 2007.

It leaves the lake just to the southwest of the village of Llangors and follows a course past the hamlets of Trefecca and Tredustan, then between the twin villages of Talgarth and Bronllys, forming the boundary of the national park in part. It then flows northeast past the village of Three Cocks otherwise known as Aberllynfi before entering the River Wye just upstream of Glasbury Bridge. The Afon Llynfi is joined by a number of tributary streams including the Tawel and Gwlithen on its left bank and the Nant Cwy (emptying directly into the lake) and Nant yr Eiddil on its right bank. The two largest tributaries are those of the Dulas which enters on the left just above Bronllys Castle Bridge and the River Ennig which enters just downstream on the opposite bank, having flowed through Talgarth.

Etymology The specific name, woodi, is in honor of taxidermist Nelson R. Wood (died 1920) of the Smithsonian Institution who collected the holotype.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Sceloporus woodi, p. 289). Description Held by human hand The adult Florida scrub lizard is about 5 inches (13 cm) in total length (including tail). It is gray or brownish with a longitudinal brown stripe down each side of the body. The male has turquoise patches on the throat and belly. The female usually lacks the throat patches but may have lighter patches on the abdomen.Branch LC, Hokit DG. \\"Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi )\\". Document WEC 139. Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Department, Florida Cooperative Extension, University of Florida IFAS. Published 2000, revised 2008, reviewed 2012. Highlands, Florida Reproduction Courtship and mating of S. woodi occur in spring. The female buries up to 5 clutches of 2 to 8 eggs each. Eggs take about 75 days to hatch, probably depending on ambient temperature. The last hatchlings of the year emerge in November. The lizard becomes sexually mature in 10 to 11 months. Habitat S. woodi is a species of the Florida scrub, including evergreen oak and sand pine scrub. It is found less often in the ecotone between scrub and sandhill habitat, flatwoods, and citrus groves. It is most common in dry habitat with open areas for basking and nesting with nearby pines or oaks for shelter. A closed canopy makes the habitat unsuitable.Hammerson, G. A. 2007. Sceloporus woodi. In: IUCN 2013. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. Downloaded on 21 July 2013. Conservation status S. woodi has a disjunct distribution with four main population areas, the Atlantic coast scrubs, the Gulf Coast scrubs, the inland central peninsula, and Ocala National Forest and environs. It occurs on the Lake Wales Ridge. It is common in the Ocala National Forest, but it is slowly declining in most of its range due to loss of habitat. It was more widespread before the intensive development of Florida's scrub zones and sandy ridges. Habitat loss to development, including the establishment of citrus groves, has reduced populations. Fire suppression causes habitat changes such as closure of the canopy, which eliminates the open spaces required by the species. This species occurs in widely spaced patches of a habitat type that is naturally fragmented, and it does not disperse far from its natal area. The main population groups have remained separate for many thousands of years, causing isolation that has led to the development of high genetic diversity in the species as a whole. During conservation efforts, it is important to maintain such diversity. ReferencesFurther reading *Behler JL, King FW (1979).

It is known for the temples on the banks of the Godavari and it has historically been one of the holy sites of the Hindu religion. It is one of the four cities that hosts the massive Sinhastha Kumbh Mela once every twelve years.  A historical perspective  Nashik was known by different names in different Yugas. According to Hindu legends, It was known as ‚ÄúPadmanagar‚Äù during Satya Yuga, ‚ÄúTrikantak‚Äù during Treta Yuga, ‚ÄúJanasthana‚Äù during Dvapara Yuga, and ultimately \\"Navashikh\\" or \\"Nashik\\" during Kali Yuga. During the Mughal period it was known as ‚ÄúGulshanabad‚Äù, the city of roses. Nashik has mythological, historical, social and cultural importance. The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of \\"Shurpanakha\\" and thus this city was named as \\"Nashik\\". After the fall of the Satavahana empire, the Abhiras or Ahirs ruled in the north east and the Chutus in Maharashtra and Kuntala. The Puranas state that ten Abhira tribes ruled for 67 years. The Nashik inscription speaks of king Madhuriputra Ishvarasena, the Abhir and a son of Shivadatla. This dynasty originated in A.D. 249‚Äì50, an era called Kalachuri or Chedi in later times. Classical Sanskrit poets like Valmiki, KƒÅlidƒÅsa and Bhavabhuti have paid rich tributes here. In 150 BC Nashik was the country's largest market place. From 1487 A.D, the province came under the rule of Mughals and its name was changed Gulshanabad (No such proofs for this name). It was also home of Emperor Akbar who wrote at length about Nashik in Ein-e- Akbari. It was also known as the 'Land of the Brave' during the regime of Maratha King Shivaji. The most important historical significance is that Kumbh Mela is conducted at Nashik once every twelve years, out of 4 places in India.  Ancient Nashik  Legend states that the name \\"Nashik\\" is derived from the Hindu epic Ramayana. During the exile of Lord Ram, Shoorpanakha, the sister of the demon king Raavan tried to seduce Ram. Angered, Ram ordered Lakshman to cut off Shoorpanakha's nose (nashika/naak). According to the Raamayan, Sita was abducted by Raavan from the area called Panchavati in the Western Ghats. Today, it is a popular religious destination within the city limits. Raam, Lakshman, Seeta at a Nashik Temple. The city got its present name in 1818 when the Peshwas got control of the city. The Peshwa rule however, did not last long and the British captured Nashik in the very same year. In 1840, one of the first modern libraries of Maharashtra (then, the Presidency of Bombay) was founded at Nashik. = Mauryan Dynasty = Nashik region was included in Mauryan Kingdom, as per inscription issued by Dharma Maha Matra of Ashoka found at Devtek in Chandrapur district. The inscription states capturing and killing of animals. Also rock-edicts of Ashoka mention the Rashtrika (Rashtrakuta dynasty)-Petenikas and the Bhoja-Petenikas. According to many scholars, Petenikas were inhabitants of Pratishthana, the Rashtrikas ruled as Maharathis, while the Bhojas held Vidarbha. This region was ruled by vassals of Mauryan Kingdom (Satvahan ancestors - regional chieftain of Mauryan Empire). = Satavahana Dynasty (207 BC - AD 199) = Just 50 years after king Ashoka's death, Satavahana came into prominence in Western Maharashtra. Its founder was Simuka. Just after Simuka ended his rule, his brother Krishna took control of the throne. It was during reign of Krishna that Nashik region was included in the Satavahana Empire. Krishna left an inscription in the cave which he excavated for Buddhist monks near nashik. The next ruler of the dynasty was Satakarni I. After his death, his wife, Nayanika/Naganika Satakarni, took control of the throne on behalf her sons, Vedishri and Shaktishri. Naneghat inscription describes Vedishri as a very brave king, who was a unique warrior on the earth and was the lord of Dakshinapatha (Deccan). Many years after the vedishree reign, most of Satavahana territories like Malwa, Nashik, Kathiawar of maharashtra were conquered by Shaka Kshatrapas. Nahapana, a Shaka Kshatrapa probably appointed by the contemporary Kushana Emperor, was ruling over Konkan, Poona, Nasik and some other districts of Maharashtra as well as some portion of Central India as far north as Ajmer . It was Nahapana who excavated pandav-leni. Several inscriptions of his son-in- law Ushavadata (Sanskrit, Rishabhadatta) have been incised in the Pandu-lena caves near Nasik. Ushavadata was the son of Dinika and had married Dakshamitra, the daughter of Nahapana. These records in the Nasik caves describe the charities and conquests of Ushavadata, who was evidently governing Northern Maharashtra and Konkan on behalf of his father-in-law. He got a cave excavated in the Trirashmi hill near Nasik and assigned it to the Buddhist monks. Later Gautamiputra Satakarni defeated Nahapana of shaka dynasty and regained the satavahana honour. He made a daring dash into Vidarbha and occupied Benakata (or the Wainganga district). Thereafter, he invaded Western Maharashtra and defeated Nahapana somewhere in the Nasik district. The Shaka king accepted satavahna vassalage, which is shown by his inscription in one of the Nasik caves, wherein he is called Benakatakasvami or the lord of Benakata (Wainganga district). According to the inscription, the king's mother, Gautami Balsari, writes about her son as follows: '...who crushed the pride and conceit of the Kshatriyas [the native Indian princes / Rajputs of Rajputana, Gujarat and central India]; who destroyed the Shakas [Western Kshatrapas], Yavanas [Indo-Greeks] and Pahlavas [Indo-Parthians]... who rooted out the Khakharata family [the Kshatrapas of Nahapana]...'. After defeating Nahapana, Gautamiputra called back his silver coins and restruck them. The hoard discovered at Jogal Tembhi in the Nasik district contained more than 10,000 silver coins so restruck. After Gautamiputra Satakarni most noteworthy successor was Yajnashri Satakari, who conquered all Maharashtra. This can be seen in inscriptions and coins that have been found over a large area. They show that he ruled over a large kingdom extending from Konkan in the west to Andhra desha in the east. He issued among other types the ship- type lead coins indicative of his rule on the maritime province of the Coromandel coast. Within fifty years after Yajnashri Satakarni the rule of the Satavahanas came to an end. By the mid-3rd century the Satvahan King dom fragamented into various parts, each having ruler who claims to be Satvahan descendent. The Satavahanas were liberal patrons of learning and religion. The early kings of the family performed Vedic sacrifices and lavished gifts on the Brahmanas. Krishna, Gautamiputra, Pulumavi and Yajnashri excavated caves and donated villages to provide for the maintenance, clothing and medicines of the Buddhist monks. During this period Nashik was very prosperous . It laid on trade route from Tagara and Pratishthana to Broach and was an important trading centre. The Nashik silk was so famous that so many European historian believe that the stylo of silk and gold brocade that Marco Polo (1290) found being woven at Baghdad and called as nasich and nac originally came from Nashik. These silks were known in Europe in the 14th century as nac, nacquts, nachis, naciz, and nasis. = Abhira Dynasty (220 - AD 377) = After fall of Satavahana empire, Abhira Dynasty came into prominence, the Abhiras ruled in the north east and the Chutus in Maharashtra and Kuntala. The Puranas state that ten Abhiras ruled for, 67 years. The Nashik inscription peaks of king Madhuriputra Ishvarasena, the Abhir and a son of Shivadatla. This dynasty originated in A. D. 249‚Äì50, an era called Kalachuri or Chedi in later times. During this time Nashik was called as Triashmi by some Sanskrit poets of Tribes. The founder of the Abhira dynasty was Rajan Ishvarasena, the son of Shivadatta, who has left an inscription in cave IX at Nasik. It records the investment of hundreds of Karshapanas in certain guilds at Nasik for providing medicines for the sick among the Buddhist mendicants residing in the Viharas of Trirashmi. Ishvarasena started an era commencing in 250 AD, which later became known as the Kalachuri-Chedi era. The earlier dates of this era come from Northern Maharashtra, Gujarat, Central India and Vidarbha. Judging by the expansion of this era, Ishvarasena and his descendants seem to have ruled a large territory comprising Gujarat, Konkan and Northern Maharashtra. Ishvarasena was followed by nine other kings of the family. They state that they ruled for 167 years. = Traikutakas (490 AD) = The Traikutakas took their family name from the mountain Trikuta which borders the Nasik district on the west. The names of three Traikutaka kings, viz., Indradatta, Dahrasena and Vyaghrasena have become known from their inscriptions and coins found in the Nasik district and Gujarat. Dahrasena performed an Ashvamedha and was, therefore, an independent king. A copper-plate grant discovered at Pardi in the Surat district records the donation, by Dahrasena, of the village Kaniyas- Tadakasarika in the Antarmandali vishaya to a Brahmana residing at Kapura. Dahrasena was succeeded by his son Vyaghrasena who had to acknowledge the supremacy of the Vakataka king Harishena. His copper-plate grant, dated in the year 241 (490 AD) of the Abhira era was discovered at Surat and records the donation of the village Purohita-palIika. = Vishnukundins = After the downfall of the Vakatakas in the beginning of the 6th century AD, Vidarbha was occupied for some time by the Vishnukundin king Madhavavarman I. He married a Vakataka princess who was probably a daughter or some other near relative of the last known Vakataka Emperor Harishena. He took advantage of the opportunity afforded by the downfall of the Vakatakas and extended his dominion far and Wide. He performed several Vedic sacrifices including eleven Ashvamedhas. That he had brought even Western Maharashtra under his rule is shown by his copper-plate grant discovered at Khanapur in the Satara district. His grandson Madhavavarman II describes himself as the lord of Trikuta and Malaya. So he may have ruled in Western Maharashtra for some time. = Kalachuris (AD 550 - 573) = The Vishnukundins were, however, ousted from Maharashtra and Vidarbha by the Kalachuri king Krishnaraja, who rose to power in about 550 AD. He ruled from Mahishmati, modern Maheshvara, in the former Indore State. His coins have been found over a wide territory extending from Rajputana in the north to Maharashtra in the south in the village Devlana in the Baglan taluka of the Nasik district. The hoard comprised 82 coins. The coins were known as Krishnarajarupakas and have been mentioned in the Anjaneri plates dated in the year 461 of the Abhira era (corresponding to 710-11 AD). They were therefore in circulation for at least 150 years after the time of Krishnaraja. Krishnaraja was succeeded by his son Shankaragana, whose copper plate, grant has been discovered at Abhona in the Nasik District.It is dated in the year 347 of the Abhira era, corresponding to 597 AD.The grant shows that Shankaragana was, like his father, ruling over an extensive kingdom stretching from Malva in the north to at least the Nasik and Aurangabad districts in the south.Shankaragana was succeeded by his son Buddharaja, who was involved in a struggle with the Chalukya king Mangalesha on the southern frontier of his kingdom soon after his accession. = Chalukyas of Badami (AD 543 - 754) = The Chalukyas of Badami rose to power in the first half of the 6th century AD. The Badami stone inscription of Pulakeshin I, who is the first independent ruler of this dynasty, is dated in 543 AD. He performed the Ashvamedha and several other Shrauta sacrifices. He was succeeded by his son Kirtivarman I, who made some conquests in South India and is described as the night of destruction to the Nalas (of the Bastar district), the Mauryas of Konkan and the Kadambas of Vanavasi (in North Kanara). When Kirtivarman died, his younger brother Mangalesha succeeded him. Mangalesha's reign ended in disaster and he lost his life in a civil war with his nephew Pulakeshin II. The capital of Pulakesin II in the beginning of his reign was Badami in the Bijapur district. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang calls him the lord of Maharashtra. This shows that he must have visited him somewhere in Maharashtra. Several identifications of his capital have been proposed by scholars from the description of it given by the Chinese pilgrim, but the most likely view seems to be that of Fleet and Burgess, who identify it with Nasik. Pulakeshin's grant dated in the Shaka year 552 (630 AD) was found at Lohaner in the Baglana taluka of the Nasik district. It is dated in the Shaka year 552 (630 AD) and records Pulakeshin's grant of the village Goviyanaka to a Brahmana residing at Lohanagara (modern Lohaner). Pulakeshin was killed in battle at Badami in circa 642 AD by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman, who conquered Vatapi and assumed the title of Vatapi-konda (the conqueror of Vatapi). Pulakeshin II was succeeded by his son Vikramaditya I (655-681 AD), after a long continued struggle. He appointed his younger brother Dharashraya Jayasimha to govern South Gujarat, North Konkan and the Nasik district. Jayasimha's Nasik plates are dated in the Abhira year 436 (685 AD) and record his grant of the village Dhondhaka on the occasion of the Vishuva or vernal equinox. Dhondhaka is identical with Dhondegaon, 12 miles north by west of Nasik. From two land-grants recently discovered at Anjaneri, a village near Trimbak in the Nasik district, we have come to know of a feudatory family which ruled over Northern Konkan and the Nasik district in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. This family claimed descent from Harishchandra, the famous legendary king of the Solar race. Svamichandra, who rose to power in the reign of Vikramaditya I, was the founder of this family, and flourished in circa 660 AD. Three generations of this family are known from the two sets of Anjaneri plates-Svamichandra, his son Simhavarman and the latter's son Bhogashakti alias Prithivichandra, who made the two grants. One of them is dated in the year 461 of the Abhira era, corresponding to 710-11 AD. It records the grant of eight villages and certain rites, dues and taxes in favour of the god Narayana, who was named Bhogeshvara evidently after king Bhogashakti, and was installed in a temple at Jayapura, modern Jarwar Budrukh near Anjaneri. The second set of Anjaneri plates tells us that Bhogashakti granted certain rights, privileges and exemptions to the merchants of Samagiripattana when he resettled the town and the neighbouring villages some time after their devastation. Bhogashakti's successor was probably overthrown by the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga, who, from his Ellora plates, is known to have occupied the Nasik district some time before 715 AD. Kirtivarman, the last of the Early Chalukyas, was defeated by Dantidurga some time before 754 AD, when lie issued his Samangad plates. Kirtivarman continued to rule for a few years more, but he had lost the paramount position in the Deccan. = Rashtrakuta Dynasty (AD 754 - 950) = The Rashtrakutas who succeeded the Chalukya in the Deccan originally hailed from Lattalura. When they rose to power they were probably residing in the Aurangabad district, where their earlier records have been found. Dantidurga was the real founder of the Rashtrakuta imperial power. Dantidurga made extensive conquests. Dantidurga was succeeded by his uncle Krishna I. who completed the conquests and shattered the power of the Early Chalukyas completely. Krishna I was not only a great conqueror but also a great builder. The Rashtrakuta family produced several great conquerors who boldly invaded North and South India and achieved memorable victories such as Druva, Govinda II . Several copper-plate grants of Govinda III have been found in the Vidarbha and Marathwada Divisions of Maharashtra. It is not possible to give a description of all of them, but we may refer to that discovered in the Nasik district. A set of plates was discovered at Wani in the Dindori taluka of the Nasik district. It was issued by Govinda III and is dated in the Shaka year 730 (808 AD) and records the grant of Ambakagram in the Vatanagara vishaya in the Nasikadesha to Brahmana Damodarabhatta, an inhabitant of Vengi, who belonged to the community of the Chaturvedins of that place. Govinda III was succeeded by his son Amoghavarsha I, who was a man of peaceful disposition, but whose reign was full of troubles. In later years, the Rashtrakuta feudatories, who rose in rebellion against Govinda IV, deposed him and placed his uncle Baddiga-Amogha varsha III on the throne. The latter was a man of quiet nature and spiritual temperament, who left the administration of the kingdom entirely to his ambitious and able son Krishna III. Like some of his illustrious ancestors, Krishna III also led an expedition in North India and captured the forts of Kalanjara and Chitrakuta. He succeeded his father in 939 AD. = Chalukyas (? - AD 1157) = The Rashtrakuta power became weak after the death of Krishna III. Within six years his large empire crumbled to pieces like a house of cards. Tailap II, the founder of the Later Chalukya dynasty, who was a Mahasamanta of the Rashtrakutas, suddenly came into prominence. The Paramara king Vakpati Munja planned to invade the Chalukya dominion but his wise minister Rudraditya advised him not to cross the Godavari, which was the boundary between the Chalukya and Paramara dominions. Munja did not heed his advice and was taken prisoner by Tailapa. He was placed in a prison where he was waited upon by Tailapa's sister Mrinalavati. He fell in love with her and foolishly disclosed to her the plan of his escape. She communicated it to Tailapa, who is said to have made him beg from door to door and then beheaded him. The most famous of the noteworthy successors after Talipa II was Vikramaditya VI, the founder of the Chalukya-Vikrama Samvat. He ascended the throne in 1075 AD. Tailap III, the last Chalukya king, was overthrown by the Kalachuri Bijjala, who was his Commander-in-Chief, in 1157 AD. = Yadavas (? - AD 1318) = In the last quarter of the 12th century AD, the Yadavas of Devagiri came into prominence. They had previously been ruling over Seunadesha (Khandesh) as feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. The founder of the family was Dridhaprahara, the son of Subahu. His capital was Shrinagara as stated in the Vratakhanda, while from an early inscription it appears to have been Chandradityapura, which is identified with the modern Chandor in the Nasik district. His son and successor was Seunachandra, from whom the country ruled over by him came to be known as Seunadesha. This corresponds to modern Khandesh. It comprised the country extending from Nasik to Devagiri.King Seunachandra established city called Seunpur/Sindiner (sinnar). From a stone inscription found at Anjaneri near Nasik it appears that there was a minor branch of the Yadava family ruling at Anjaneri. Seunadeva of this branch made some grant to a Jain temple. Seunadeva calls himself Mahasamanta and evidently was dependent on the main branch. This family ruled over a small district of which Anjaneri was the chief city. there were many noteworthy rulers in the Yadava dynasty . In 1294 AD Ala-ud-din Khalji invaded the kingdom of Ramachandra and suddenly appeared before the gates of Devagiri. Ramachandra was taken unawares and could not hold out long. He had to pay a heavy ransom to the Muslim conqueror. He continued, however, to rule till 1310 AD at least; for the aforementioned Purushottampuri plates are dated in that year. He was succeeded by his son Shankaragana some time in 1311 AD. He discontinued sending the stipulated tribute to Delhi. He was then defeated and slain by Malik Kafur. Some time thereafter, Harapaladeva, the son-in-law of Ramachandra, raised an insurrection and drove away the Muhammedans, but his success was short-lived. The Hindu kingdom of Devagiri thus came to an end in 1318 AD. During their rule a peculiar style of architecture called Hemadpanti after Hemadri or Hemadpant, a minister of Mahadeva and Ramachandra came into vogue. Temples built in this style are found in all the districts of Maharashtra.Marathi literature also flourished in the age of the Yadavas. Chakradhara, who propagated the Mahanubhava cult in that age, used Marathi as the medium of his religious teaching. Following his example, several of his followers composed literary works in Marathi. = Maratha period = Nashik area was under the control of Mughals until ‚ÄòAurangjeb‚Äôs death (i.e. 1707) * After 1707 Nashik area fully came under Maratha kingdom. * Chieftain Naroshankar Raje Bahadar built Rameshwara temple and hung the Naroshankar bell there. * Kapaleshwara temple was built in 1738. * Chieftain Chandrachud built Sundar Narayana temple in 1756. * Chieftain Aadekar rebuilt Kalaram temple in 1790. * Nijam Ul Mulk Asaf Jahan‚Äô died in 1748 and his son Nasir Jung became king. After Bajirao's death, his elder son Nanasaheb became the new Peshava. But in this new kingdom era also, Nijam and Maratha conflicts were continued. Nasir Jung got murdered in 1751 and Nijam's third son took the authority. He attacked Marathas from Aurangabad with the help of French people. But Marathas and Nijam's third son were agreed on peace talks and battle got cancelled in 1752. According to these peace talks Marathas received all Khandesh area between Godavari and Tapi river under their rule. In 1751, after Nijam's death Marathas started using the name ‚ÄòNashik‚Äô for the city. As it was called ‚ÄòGulshanabad‚Äô in Nijam's rule. In 1760‚Äì61, after ‚ÄòSalabat Jung‚Äôs defeat, Nashik was an important city for Peshavas. * In 1761 Madhavrao became new Peshava, after Nanasaheb‚Äôs death. * 1763 ‚Äì Vinayak Rao abandoned Nashik, Junnar and Sangamner cities. Peshavas appointed Balaji Sakharam as governor of a Bagal province. * Peshava‚Äôs were ruling this area till 1818. Thomas Hyslow and British army conquered Kopargaon and north side of Chandwad in 1818. * They conquered Thalner from Khandesh area, Chandwad fort on 7 March 1818. At the end of March 1818 , British army conquered total Nashik area in battle with Holkars. = British period = The British conquered the Maratha kingdom and declared Nashik as an important city as a Division. People from ‚ÄòBhilla‚Äô community started protest against British government. Almost 7000 people from south Nashik and north Ahemadnagar contributed in the protest march. ‚ÄòMagoji Naik‚Äô was the main leader in the march; he reunited all the tribal people. British army sent Lieutenants Henry T. Thatcher and L. Tailor to deal with the ‚ÄòBhilla‚Äô people. Before attacking ‚ÄòBhillas‚Äô, governor of Sangamner and Sinnar area asked ‚ÄòMagoji Naik‚Äô to surrender, but he refused. ‚ÄòBhogoji Naik‚Äô was another important leader from the ‚ÄòBhilla‚Äô people. After a tough battle British army could gain the control back in hand over Nashik area. Then there was a peace until 1860. * 1860 - Nashik received a rank of ‚Äòseparate district‚Äô. * 1861 - British started Anglo- vernacular school * 1864 - Nashik city received a ‚ÄòNagar Parishad‚Äô status. First newspaper in Nashik area started in this period which was called as ‚ÄòNashik news‚Äô. * 1877 - Gopal Hari Deshmukh and ‚ÄòNyayamurthi Mahadev Ranade‚Äô entered in social life of Nashik city. * 1899 - Veer Vinayak Sawarkar whose birthplace is Bhagur in Nashik secretly started ‚ÄòRashtrabhakta‚Äô organization. ‚ÄòMitramela‚Äô group also gave fame to Nashik. * Veer Sawarkar visited London and stayed there. He administered ‚ÄòMitramela‚Äô group from London. * Lokmanya Tilak conducted a protest march against British government in Nashik, on 31 May 1907. * Hutatma Anant Kanhere took part in ‚ÄòMitramela‚Äô group and in its social work. * Anant Kanhere shot dead Mr Jackson, a cruel collector of Nashik, on 21 December 1909. * Krishna Gopal Karve, Narayan Joshi, Ganesh Joshi were got interrogated in Mr Jackson's murder case. * British government hanged Mr. Kanhere, Karve, and Deshpande for Mr. Jakson's murder. * British army arrested Veer Sawarkar and kept in prison. * Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar also contributed in Nashik's development. * Dr Ambedkar fought for rights of untouched people and gave them right to enter Hindu temples. This is called as ‚ÄòKalaram Satyagraha‚Äô. British people conquered all Maratha kingdom and declared Nashik as an important city as a Division Some of the major events in history of Nashik in last three centuries were: * 1615: The city was captured by Moguls(Kaustubh Shimpi) from Nijamshah Sultan and name changed to \\"Gulshanabad\\". * 1634: The city was recaptured by Shahaji Raje for his new state of Nijamshah Headquartered in Pemgiri(Near Sangamner) * 1636: Shahaji Raje made Pact with Mogul Nashik again moved to Mogul rule * 1663: Netaji Palkar recovered \\"Chauthai\\" from Nashik for Shivaji of Pune * 1673: Jadhavrao and Siddi Halal left job of Mogul and joined army of Shivaji on Tribak Fort thus Nashik became part of Maratha rule * 1685: Aurangzeb Captured Nashik City during Sambhaji's rule. * 1695: City was raided by Santaji followed by Temporary Maratha Rule * 1719: Officially Shahu got right to collect \\"Chauthai\\" of City from Moguls of Delhi * 1725: The city frequently camped by Marathas who heading to Malwa, Gujrat for campaigns. * 1734: The city name was restored to 'NASHIK'. * 1862: Nashik Road railway station was built. * 1864: Nashik Municipality formed * 1869: Nashik district formed. Nashik also participated in the freedom struggle of India. On 21 December 1909, 17-year-old Anant Kanhere shot the Collector of Nashik, Jackson in a theatre named Vijayanand theatre, where he had gone to see a play Sharada. Jackson died on the spot. The people involved in the incident, Anant Laxman Kanhere, Krishnaji Gopal Karve and Vinayak Ramchandra Deshpande were sentenced to death by hanging and were hanged soon after. In 1930, the Nashik Satyagraha was launched under the leadership of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar for the entry of Dalits in Kalaram Mandir (Temple). In 1931, a meeting of the Bombay Province Charmkar Parishad was organised in Nashik to work out the Chambhars' position with regard to the Second Round Table Conference in which Babasaheb was going to participate. In 1932, Babasaheb organized his temple entry movement for the abolition of untouchability in Nashik. There is a confusion whether it is pronounced Nasik or Nashik. Before 1982 both the city and district were called by the name Nasik. On 7 November 1982 the population of Nasik City exceeded to 1.2 million, so as per incorporation rules, Nasik City became a Corporation. Since then the city name has changed to Nashik City.

Winner Take All Moyo's third book, Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World (2012), examines the commodity dynamics that the world will face over the next several decades, according to Moyo. In particular, it explores the implications of China's rush for natural resources across all regions of the world. Noting that the scale of China's resource campaign for hard commodities (metals and minerals) and soft commodities (timber and food) is one of the largest in history, Moyo presents her research and conclusions concerning the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources.Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World .

It is anchored by Walmart and Maxi. History Place Fleur de Lys opened on March 21, 1963 with anchors Simpsons-Sears (Sears), Steinberg and Zellers. Place Fleurs de Lys is notable for having the first ever Sears department store in the province of Quebec. On October 17, 1968, S.S. Kresge Co Lt√©e opened a Kmart store. As with Sears five years earlier, the Kmart at Place Fleurs de Lys was the first in the province. In March 1980, Place Fleur de Lys expanded from 650 000 square feet to 850 000 to reach 170 stores including a new Pascal hardware store. After Pascal closed, its former space of 75 000 square feet was converted into another mall expansion of 145 000 square feet anchored by a single level The Bay store which opened on October 7, 1992. Steinberg went bankrupt in 1992 and its store at Fleur de Lys was not converted into another supermarket. It was instead replaced on May 5, 1993 by Club Biz, an office supply retailer founded by former executives of the Steinberg supermarket chain, which operated until 1996. Club Biz at Place Fleur de Lys was the chain's only store located outside the Montreal area. Kmart closed on May 31, 1995 and the Zellers in the mall relocated in its space. Zellers at Fleur de Lys was the last remaining store of the chain in Quebec City by the time it closed on March 14, 2013. Target had acquired the lease of Zellers and opened a store at Fleur de Lys on October 18, 2013 as part of the retailer's second wave of openings in Quebec. In 2015, Walmart bought the lease of the former Target store. Sears lasted until the end of the chain on January 14, 2018. The departure of Sears came four months after the mall had lost another department store, The Bay, which closed on September 23, 2017.

On April 2, 2016, Hutchins became the winningest head coach in NCAA Division I Softball history when Michigan defeated Indiana, passing Margie Wright's record of 1,457 career wins. Softball and basketball player A native of Lansing, Michigan, Hutchins attended Everett High School, where she was an All-City basketball player from 1973 to 1975. Hutchins also played for the Lansing Laurels, an Amateur Softball Association fastpitch team that finished as high as fifth nationally. After graduating from high school, Hutchins attended Michigan State University, where she played on the Spartans varsity basketball and softball teams from 1976 to 1979. Hutchins was a Michigan State starting shortstop as a freshman and helped the Michigan State softball team win an Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) National Softball Championship. Coaching career After graduating from Michigan State in 1979, Hutchins attended Indiana University where she received a master's degree in physical education in 1981. She began her coaching career as an assistant coach at Indiana in 1981 and next became the head coach at Ferris State University in 1982. In 1983, she was hired as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan, a position she held from 1983 to 1984. She became the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines softball team in 1985. When she took over as head coach, Hutchins reportedly \\"had a tiny salary, an only slightly larger budget, and had to take care of her own field, throwing down lime and riding the lawn tractor.\\" Hutchins joked that there is still a dent in the fence from a day the tractor \\"just went wild.\\" Since Hutchins became Michigan's coach, the team has never had a losing season. Hutchins' teams have won 19 Big Ten Conference regular-season titles, nine Big Ten Conference Softball Tournament titles, and 18 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regional championships. She has been named Big Ten Coach of the Year on 17 occasions, National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) Regional Coach of the Year nine times, and NFCA National Coach of the Year twice. She led the Michigan softball team to its first (NCAA) Women's College World Series championship in 2005. The 2005 Michigan Wolverines softball team was the first team from East of the Mississippi River to win the Women's College World Series. The Ann Arbor News described the team's accomplishment this way: > \\"What happened during the past five months might be the most unlikely > accomplishment in the history of a storied athletics program, analogous to > setting out to win an NCAA hockey title at the University of New Mexico. > Then doing it. Now, before you dismiss that as hyperbole, consider a few > factors. Like the fact that, because of cold weather, the Wolverines played > their first 33 games on the road, roughly half the season. Try doing that in > football or basketball. Then there's recruiting. Softball is still a sport > dominated by West Coast talent. ... There's a reason no team East of the > Mississippi had won an NCAA softball title until now.\\" After Michigan defeated No. 1 ranked Arizona in March 2005, Hutchins told a reporter, \\"Yes, there is softball east of the Rockies.\\" The performance of the 2005 team also set Michigan records in several categories: * The team's 65 victories was the most in program history; * The team recorded 32 consecutive victories between February 13, 2005, and March 30, 2005; * The team's 103 home runs tied for the second most in NCAA history. * The team's first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After winning the World Series, Hutchins and her team visited the White House in July 2005, where they met with President George W. Bush, something Hutchins called \\"a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\\" In March 2000, she recorded her 638th win, giving her more career wins than any other coach in University of Michigan history in any sport, male or female. In 2007, she became the seventh coach in NCAA softball history, and the first in any sport at the University of Michigan, to reach 1,000 career wins. After winning her 1,000th game, Hutchins told a reporter that her greatest pride did not come from the 1,000 wins, but from her ability to influence how her players look at life, \\"to get them to work together and to meet standards, to show them they can lead as women.\\" When she was inducted into the NFCA Hall of Fame, her players presented her with a scrapbook with a note from one saying, \\"I came here a girl with potential and left here a woman with no limits.\\" Hutchins noted that those 15 words matter more than the 1,000 wins. On October 4, 2017, Hutchins signed a five-year contract extension with the Wolverines. Honors and personal life In 2000 Hutchins was inducted into the Greater Lansing Sports Hall of Fame. In 2006, she was inducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall of Fame. In 2011, she was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Hutchins is an avid mountain biker and runner, and continued playing organized softball and hockey until 1998.

Vinnerborg has won Guldpipan () three times, awarded to the premier official in Elitserien as voted by the players. Vinnerborg has officiated at seven IIHF sanctioned events, among them four consecutive World Championships between 2006‚Äî2009, and at the 2010 Olympics. He has officiated the World Championship gold medal game twice, 2007 in Moscow and 2008 in Qu√©bec. In 2010, Vinnerborg made history when he became the first European referee to officiate in the National Hockey League (NHL). Officiating career Vinnerborg played hockey for IF Troja/Ljungby, and in 1986, he represented Sm√•land in TV-pucken. He began his officiating career at minor hockey-level in 1987 after having quit playing ice hockey. He was a linesman at Allsvenskan- level for several years before he decided to take the referee education, in 2000, he became a referee in Elitserien. In 2006, Vinnerborg officiated at the 2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he was selected as the referee for the bronze medal game between Finland and USA. He was then selected to officiate at the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Riga, Latvia, where he officiated until the semifinals started. Vinnerborg and Thomas Andersson became Elitserien's first professional referees prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season. He was again selected to go the World Championship in 2007, and he was selected to officiate the final between Canada and Finland. Vinnerborg together with Brent Reiber officiated the 2008 IIHF European Champions Cup final between HC Sparta Prague and Metallurg Magnitogorsk, the tournament was one of three trials of the four-man official system which later was introduced at the Ice Hockey World Championships. Vinnerborg was awarded Guldpipan as Elitserien's premier referee during the 2007‚Äì08 season, as voted by the player. After receiving the award prior to game three of the 2008 Swedish Championship final between Link√∂ping HC and HV71, Vinnerborg faced controversy after making a critical error when not awarding a penalty to Link√∂ping HC, after HV71's defenceman Johan √Ökerman had intentionally shot a broken stick at the puck while being shorthanded. Link√∂ping lost the game and Vinnerborg was not chosen to officiate the next game, Link√∂ping's coach Janne Karlsson criticised the league since the four-man official system was not in use during the finals. For the third consecutive year Vinnerborg was selected to officiate at the World Championship, in 2008 held in Canada on NHL-sized rinks. Vinnerborg and fellow Swede Christer L√§rking were selected to officiate the gold medal game between Russia and Canada, making it Vinnerborg's second consecutive final appearance. They stood for a controversial but correct puck out penalty on Canada's Rick Nash in overtime, which led to Ilya Kovalchuk scoring the championship winning goal on the man advantage that followed. Vinnerborg suffered an injury to his neck and head after a collision with HV71's Mattias Tedenby during a pre-season game in 2008, which led to him missing the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. On 30 September 2008, during a game between hosts SC Bern and the New York Rangers, Vinnerborg and Don Koharski became the first tandem of National Hockey League (NHL) and IIHF referees in an international event. In May 2010, the NHL announced that Vinnerborg would be joining the NHL's officiating staff for the 2010‚Äì11 season, as the first European-trained NHL official. He will primarily be assigned to games in the American Hockey League (AHL) with some work at the NHL level. \\"His knowledge of the North American game and his work ethic and professionalism will make him a positive addition to the NHL staff,\\" said league director of officials Terry Gregson. He worked his first game in the NHL on November 16, 2010, a 2‚Äì1 win for the Dallas Stars over the visiting Anaheim Ducks. Personal life Vinnerborg lives in Ljungby with his wife Anna and their twin daughters Amanda and Vilma. He worked as a high school teacher in English and German before his career as a full-time professional referee.

Originally established in October 1815 as The Independent, it took its current name during the Second Restoration. A voice for Liberals, Bonapartists, and critics of the church, it was suppressed five times, reappearing each time under a new name. Its primary contributors were Antoine Jay, √âvariste Dumoulin, Adolphe Thiers, Louis Fran√ßois Auguste Cauchois-Lemaire, as well as Alexander Chevassut and his son- in-law Nicole Robinet de La Serve. During the 19th century, European monarchs were wary of the press and often suppressed it because they believed it could spark popular uprisings. Newspapers which covered national news were rare and read by few, especially since Germany and Italy were not yet nation-states. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"the first signs of a popular press\\" appeared in Continental Europe with La Presse in 1836, founded by √âmile de Girardin.\\"Publishing, history of.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 27 January 2009. At the same time, Louis V√©ron founded the Revue de Paris in 1829 and revived Le Constitutionnel in 1835. In 1848, it played a key role in the election of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte and was a major government newspaper of the Second French Empire. V√©ron asked Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve to write a weekly column on current literary topics. Sainte-Beuve called the now-famous collection Causeries du lundi (\\"Monday Chats\\"). His essays appeared in Le Constitutionnel from October 1849 to November 1852 and from September 1861 to January 1867 as well as in other papers. They were ruminations on authors and their works, with an emphasis on French literature.\\"Sainte-Beuve, Charles-Augustin.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 27 January 2009. Sainte- Beuve's reputation as one of the most important French literary critics of the day rested on these columns, in which he guided the literary tastes of the populace.Martin Travers, European Literature from Romanticism to Postmodernism: A Reader in Aesthetic Practice, Continuum International Publishing Group (2001), 90. Like other papers at the time, Le Constitutionnel had a \\"literary slant\\", which covered up their lack of national news, a slant, which according to Britannica, \\"persists to some degree in the modern era\\" in French newspapers. In 1862, Jules Mir√®s purchased the newspaper as its quality was worsening. Beginning in 1880, it saw a real decline and ceased publication in 1914.

Thus, classes, objects, use cases, components, nodes, node instances etc. can all be organized as packages, thus enabling a manageable organization of the myriad elements that a real-world UML model entails.  Usage  When organizing functional models (use case models, workflow models etc.), use packages to model the real-world modular structure of the system being modeled. When organizing source code, use packages to represent the different layers of the source code. For instance: * presentation layer * controller layer * data access layer * integration layer * business services layer When organizing component models, use packages to group the components according to ownership and/or reuse possibilities. For instance: * commercial-off-the-shelf products * open-source framework components * custom-built framework components * custom-built application components When organizing deployment models, use packages to represent the different types of deployment environments that you will be modeling.

He was best known for scoring for both sides in the 1946 FA Cup Final, becoming the first player to do so. Football career Turner was born in Brithdir, Caerphilly and, after school, he joined the Welch Regiment where he had a reputation as an all-round sportsman winning medals for rugby, athletics and hockey with Army teams, as well as playing football. On leaving the army, he returned to his place of birth where he made four appearances for the village team before a trial with Charlton Athletic. Turner signed in August 1933 and made his first team debut in the Football League Third Division South, with twenty appearances at centre half in the 1933‚Äì34 season as Charlton finished fifth in the table. In the next season, he started off at centre half, playing alongside Bill Dodgin and Frank Harris before the arrival of Don Welsh in February led to him being moved to right back. The team that manager Jimmy Seed had assembled went on to claim the Division title at the end of the season, and finished as runners-up in the Second Division in 1936, thus achieving back-to-back promotions. In their first season in Division One, Charlton finished in the runners-up spot, missing the League title by only three points to champions Manchester City, with the meanest defence in the division conceding only 49 goals. Turner continued to play regularly for Charlton up to the outbreak of the Second World War, as Charlton consolidated their place in the top flight with fourth place and third-place finishes in the next two seasons. By now, Turner's club form had brought him to the notice of the Welsh selectors and he made his international debut at Ninian Park on 17 October 1936 in a 2‚Äì1 victory over England. Wales followed this with victories over Scotland (2‚Äì1) and Ireland (4‚Äì1) to comfortably claim the 1937 British Home Championship. Turner made a total of eight appearances for Wales prior to the war, with five victories and three defeats. He continued to turn out regularly for Wales during the early part of the war, making a further eight appearances in wartime internationals. After the cessation of hostilities, there was no League football in 1945‚Äì46. The FA Cup was the main competition to be played this season; to make up for the lack of quality matches, all FA Cup rounds from round one up to and including the quarter- finals were made two-legged ties (rather than the traditional single matches) with the aggregate score determining who went through to the next round. After easy victories over Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End and Brentford, Charlton met Bolton Wanderers in the semi-final. Bolton were still suffering from the after-effects of the Burnden Park disaster in which 33 spectators were killed as a result of overcrowding. Charlton won the semi-final comfortably to set up a Cup Final against Derby County. The final was played at Wembley Stadium on 27 April 1946. The game was goalless until the 85th minute, when Jackie Stamps and a Charlton defender jumped up to head a centre from the right. As the ball was nodded out it went straight to Dally Duncan, who shot goalwards. Turner tried to kick the ball clear, but only managed to turn the ball into his own net. In the next minute Turner scored for his own side when he took a free-kick from the edge of the Rams' penalty area, and although goalkeeper Vic Woodley appeared to have the shot well covered, the ball struck a Derby player and was deflected past Woodley into the opposite corner of the net to which he was diving. Turner thus became the first player to score for both sides in an FA Cup Final, a feat subsequently repeated by Tommy Hutchison in 1981 and Gary Mabbutt in 1987. At the age of 36 years 312 days, Turner also became the oldest player to score in an FA Cup Final. The match finished level after 90 minutes, but in extra time Derby County scored three goals to win the match 4‚Äì1. Turner played one more season with Charlton, but was no longer a regular choice, and was used as cover for Peter Croker at right back or Herbert Johnson at right-half. Turner retired in 1947 after a 14-year Charlton career in which he played 196 matches. Apart from the cup- final goal, his only other goals were two penalties.  Coaching career  He moved to Dartford as player-coach 1947 and 1950 he spent a year in the Netherlands coaching Dortrecht FC.Interview with Bert Turner¬¥s daughter Jillian 2013The Essential History of Charlton Athletic.2001 He then left for Sweden where he coached Malm√∂ FF and Kalmar FF.

It is the auspicious birth day of Lord jagannath. It is an important festival for the Sanatana or Hindu dharma.This is the first occasion in the year as per the Hindu calendar, when the deities Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, Sudarshan, and Madanmohan are brought out from the Jagannath Temple (Puri) and taken in a procession to the Snana Bedi. There they are ceremonially bathed and decorated for a public audience with the devotees.The official website of the Puri Jagannath temple .  Religious Significance  gajanana besha It is a belief among devotees of Lord Jagannath that if they make a pilgrimage to see the deity on this day, they would be cleansed of all of their sins. Hundreds of thousands of devotees visit the temple on the occasion. The Skanda Purana mentions that King Indradyumna arranged this ceremony for the first time when the idols of the deities were first installed.  Ceremonies Conducted  The Anasara pata chitra paintings balabhadra on snana yatra On the eve of the Snana Yatra (which means the Divine Bathing festival, in Sanskrit), the idols of the deities are brought out in a grand procession from the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) to the Snana Bedi (bathing platform). Devotees come to view the deities. On the day of the Snana Yatra, the deities are bathed with 108 pots, of ritually purified water drawn from the northern well of the temple to the accompaniment of religious incantations. In the evening, at the conclusion of the bathing ritual, Jagannath and Balabhadra are dressed up in elephant headgear representing the God Ganesh. This form of the God is called the 'Gajavesha'. After the Snana Yatra the Gods are traditionally believed to fall ill and are kept in a sick room to recuperate in privacy under the care of the Raj Vaidya. During this period known as Anasara the Gods cannot be seen by devotees. At this time three pata chitra paintings are displayed for devotees to view instead It is said that with the Ayurvedic medication ('pnachan') administered by the Raj Vaidya the Gods recover in a fortnight and resume giving an audience to their devotees.Details of the ceremony During the Anasara period devotees head to the Alarnatha Mandira in Bramhagiri in the belief that Jagannath manifests as Alarnatha during this period  References  Festivals in Jagannath Festivals in Odisha Hindu festivals Religious festivals in India ","title":"Snana Yatra"},{"id":"21278408","text":"\\"I'm on the Outside (Looking In)\\" is a 1964 hit song by Little Anthony and the Imperials, issued on DCP Records. It was a Billboard Top 20 Pop hit, peaking at number 15. Written by Teddy Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein, this was the group's comeback single, ending a long period of inactivity. After the group's first hit-making period, with such hits as \\"Tears on My Pillow\\", \\"Two People In The World\\", and \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko Bop\\", lead singer \\"Little Anthony\\" Gourdine left the group for a solo career. Both he and the group released records separately, but none of them were hits. By 1963, both entities had faded from the charts. In the interim, The Imperials had gone through some membership changes as well. While original members Ernest Wright and group founder Clarence Collins had remained with the group, the other original members, Tracy Lord and Nathanial Rogers, left the group, and Sammy Strain joined the group. In late 1963, writer and producer Teddy Randazzo, a childhood friend of some of the group members and now a songwriter for Don Costa Productions, contacted the group, saying that he had written a song that he wanted them to record, and from that point on, things began to change for The Imperials. Gourdine, Wright, Collins, and Strain went to the studio and recorded \\"I'm On The Outside (Looking In)\\". With the help of New York disk jockey Murray the K, the song became an immediate hit and re-established The Imperials as a hitmaking force. This song was the first of a long string of hits by Randazzo for the group, which helped them transcend their status as a teen doo-wop group and established them as successful in the adult contemporary radio format. Cover versions were recorded by The Miracles, Johnny Mathis, Baby Washington, The Moments, and others.

Both are estimated to have been equivalent to F3 in intensity on the modern Fujita scale of tornado intensity, which was not devised until 1971. The March 20 tornado was the costliest tornado in Oklahoma history at the time. On March 25, meteorologists at the base noticed the extreme similarity between the weather conditions of that day and March 20, and later in the day issued a \\"tornado forecast\\", which was verified when a tornado struck the base that evening. This was the first official tornado forecast, as well as the first successful tornado forecast, in recorded history. March 20 tornado Weather forecasting was still crude and prone to large errors in the era before weather satellites and computer modeling. Thunderstorms were not even in the forecast for the evening of March 20. However, around 9:30 pm storms were reported about to the southwest, and at 9:52 a tornado was sighted near Will Rogers Airport away, along with a wind gust, moving northeast towards the base. At 10:00, the tornado reached the southwest corner of the base. Illuminated by nearly constant lightning, the tornado was highly visible as it bisected the base, tossing around planes which were parked in the open. The control tower reported a wind gust before the windows shattered, injuring several personnel with flying glass. The tornado dissipated at the northeast corner of the base. The tornado missed most structures on the base, but the damage to expensive military aircraft was substantial. The total damage cost came to around $10 million, or $ million in United States dollars. This was the most damaging tornado in Oklahoma up to that date. Investigation and tornado forecast In the aftermath of the first tornado, an official inquiry was conducted into the failure to predict the destructive tornado. Air Force investigators came to the conclusion that \\"due to the nature of the storm it was not forecastable given the present state of the art.\\" They also made recommendations that the meteorological community determine a tornado warning system for the public, as well as a protocol for protecting life and property at military bases. Both of these investigations began almost immediately. In the days following the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping to be able to identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future. On the morning of March 25, base meteorologists noticed that weather charts for the day were strikingly similar to those before the March 20 tornado. Forecasts issued by the Weather Bureau indicated that almost the same conditions would be present in the evening of March 25 as were present on March 20. In the morning, they issued a forecast for \\"heavy thunderstorms\\" effective for 5‚Äì6 pm that evening. This would allow the base's commander to alert base personnel that they may institute their brand-new tornado precautions. As the day wore on, conditions appeared more and more favorable for thunderstorms, and more and more similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas. March 25 tornado Damage to airplanes and cars from the March 25 tornado Although storms were relatively benign up to the point where they reached Tinker, a supercell formed just west of the base, and at around 6 pm a tornado touched down on the base for the second time in six days. This second tornado caused $6 million in damage, or $ million in dollars. However, due to precautions enacted because of the tornado forecast, no injuries were reported, and damage totals could have been much higher. Legacy The tornado prediction proved to be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance. Before this point, the Weather Bureau had a policy against issuing tornado warnings, mainly due to fear of panic by the public, and subsequent complacency if forecasts turned out to be false alarms. Due to lives and costs saved, Fawbush and Miller continued their tornado forecasts, which verified at quite a high rate over the next three years. At first, they kept their forecasts secret. In the spring and summer of 1949, they issued eighteen forecasts for tornadoes within a area, and all eighteen proved successful. In the subsequent years, while not explicitly using the word \\"tornado\\", the Weather Bureau used the pair's forecasts to predict \\"severe local storms\\". The synoptic pattern which occurred on March 25 later became known as the \\"Miller type-B\\" pattern and is recognized as one of the most potent severe weather setups.

It occurs in the semi-arid regions of the African continent (e.g. northern Nigeria and Uganda). Its larvae are found in small tubular nests in the mud at the bottom of temporary pools that frequently dry out during the lifetime of P. vanderplanki larvae. Under these conditions, the larvae's body desiccates to as low as 3% water content by weight. In the dehydrated state the larvae become impervious to many extreme environmental conditions, and can survive temperatures from 3 K to up to 375 K, very high (7000 gray) levels of gamma-rays, and exposure to vacuum. It is one of few metazoans that can withstand near complete desiccation (anhydrobiosis) in order to survive adverse environmental conditions. Slow desiccation (0.22 ml per day) enabled larvae to synthesize 38 Œºg trehalose/individual, and all of them recovered after rehydration, whereas larvae that were dehydrated 3 times faster accumulated only 6.8 Œºg trehalose/individual and none of them revived after rehydration. Late Embryo Abundant (LEA), anti-oxidant, and heat-shock proteins may also be involved in survival. This species is considered the most cold-tolerant insect species, able to survive liquid helium (‚àí270 ¬∞C) exposure for up to 5 min. with a 100% survival rate when desiccated to 8% water content.

The Fort Worth Public Libraries consist of 16 branches including the central library and two regional libraries. History In April 1892, 20 women formed the idea for the city's first library while meeting at the home of Jennie Scott Scheuber. Under the Fort Worth Public Library Association, this association received its state charter and with the financial support from Andrew Carnegie they brought the Fort Worth Public Library into existence. Carnegie donated building funds for the construction of more than 2,000 libraries in the United States and from 1886 to 1919 he donated $56 million. Carnegie suggested to the founding women that they ask the local gentlemen for \\"the price of a good cigar\\" to help raise the necessary local supporting funds. Sarah Gray Jennings donated the land at 915 Throckmorton Street on stipulation that it always be used for a library. When the City Council approved spending $4,000 per year to run the library, Carnegie contributed $50,000 for the building. The Carnegie Public Library of Fort Worth opened on October 17, 1901, at Ninth and Throckmorton streets.  The PWA Library  As early as 1926 it was becoming clear that the Carnegie funded building was no longer large enough to handle Fort Worth‚Äôs swelling population. The situation became worse during the onset of the Great Depression, when reading rooms became so full that the facility lacked enough chairs or lights at most hours of the day and night. The library board appealed to the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933 for funds with $400,000 in subsidies finally arrived in Fort Worth in 1937. A three story, triangular PWA Moderne structure designed by Joseph R. Pelich was built over the spot of the old neoclassical Carnegie library and opened in 1938. Mrs. Scheuber was retired from her role and head librarian and replaced with the professionally trained Harry Peterson, who converted the collection to the Dewey Decimal System and removed the library‚Äôs collection of relics to the local children‚Äôs museum. In 1967 the building received a Texas Historical Marker in 1967. In 1978 a new central library building was built at 300 Taylor Street. The old Art Deco building was returned to the ownership of the Sarah Gray Jennings estate in 1980, and although attempts were made to preserve the building as a performing arts center, the old library was razed in 1990 for a parking lot. Central Library Expansion Fort Worth's Central Library expansion officially opened October 22, 1999. On March 28, 2000 the Fort Worth Tornado caused over a million dollars in damage to the new Central Library. Central Library has a spacious Learning Commons for patrons to enjoy a book, magazine, or use a computer. The Central Library also offers its users free Internet access at the computer lab or with WiFi. Computer classes are available to promote information literacy.

The phenomenon of small talk was initially studied in 1923 by Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski in his essay \\"The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages\\", who coined the term \\"phatic communication\\" to describe it.Malinowski, B. (1923) \\"The problem of meaning in primitive languages\\", in: Ogden, C. & Richards, I., The Meaning of Meaning, Routledge, London The ability to conduct small talk is a social skill; hence, small talk is some type of social communication.  Purpose  In spite of seeming to have little useful purpose, small talk is a bonding ritual and a strategy for managing interpersonal distance.Bickmore, T. (1999) A Computational Model of Small Talk, accessed online at media.mit.edu It serves many functions in helping to define the relationships between friends, colleagues, and new acquaintances. In particular, it helps new acquaintances to explore and categorize each other's social position.Laver, J. (1975), \\"Communicative Functions of Phatic Communion\\", in: Kendon, A. / Harris, R. / Key, M. (eds.), The Organisation of Behaviour in Face-to-Face Interaction, pp.215‚Äì238, The Hague: Mouton. Small talk is closely related to the need for people to maintain a positive face and feel approved of by those who are listening to them. It lubricates social interactions in a very flexible way, but the desired function is often dependent on the point in the conversation at which the small talk occurs:Holmes, J. (2000) \\"Doing collegiality and keeping control at work: small talk in government departments\\", in: J. Coupland, (ed.) Small Talk, Pearson, Harlow UK. # Conversation opener: when the speakers do not know each other, it allows them to show that they have friendly intentions and desire some sort of positive interaction. In a business meeting, it enables people to establish each other's reputation and level of expertise. If there is already a relationship between the two talkers, their small talk serves as a gentle introduction before engaging in more functional topics of conversation. It allows them to signal their own mood and to sense the mood of the other person. # At the end of a conversation: suddenly ending an exchange may risk appearing to reject the other person. Small talk can be used to mitigate that rejection, affirm the relationship between the two people, and soften the parting. # Space filler to avoid silence: in many cultures, silences between two people are usually considered uncomfortable and/or awkward. Tension can be reduced by starting phatic talk until a more substantial subject arises. Generally, humans find prolonged silence uncomfortable, and sometimes unbearable. That can be due to human evolutionary history as a social species, as in many other social animals, silence is a communicative sign of potential danger.Joseph Jordania. \\"Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history\\". Kadmos 1, 2009: 272‚Äì277 In some conversations, there is no specific functional or informative element at all. The following example of small talk is between two colleagues who pass each other in a hallway: : William: Morning, Paul. : Paul: Oh, morning, William, how are you? : William: Fine, thanks. Have a good weekend. : Paul: Yes, thanks. Catch you later. : William: OK, see you. In that example, the elements of phatic talk at the beginning and end of the conversation have merged. The entire short conversation is a space- filler. This type of discourse is often called chatter. The need to use small talk depends upon the nature of the relationship between the people having the conversation. Couples in an intimate relationship can signal their level of closeness by a lack of small talk. They can comfortably accept silence in circumstances that would be uncomfortable for two people who were only casual friends.Jaworski, A. (2000) \\"Silence and small talk\\", in: J. Coupland, Small Talk, Pearson, Harlow UK. In workplace situations, small talk tends to occur mostly between workers on the same level, but it can be used by managers as a way of developing the working relationships with the staff who report to them. Bosses who ask their employees to work overtime may try to motivate them by using small talk to temporarily decrease their difference in status.Holmes, J. (1998) \\"Don't Under-Rate Small Talk\\", New Zealand Business, 12,9. The balance between functional conversation and small talk in the workplace depends on the context and is also influenced by the relative power of the two speakers. It is usually the superior who defines the conversation because they have the power to close the small talk and \\"get down to business.\\"Holmes, J. & Fillary, R. (2000) \\"Handling Small Talk at Work: challenges for workers with intellectual disabilities\\", International Journal of Disability 47,3.  Topics  The topics of small talk conversations are generally less important than their social function.Tracy, K. & Naughton, J. M. (2000) \\"Institutional identity-work: a better lens\\", in: J. Coupland, Small Talk, Pearson, Harlow UK. The selected topic usually depends on any pre-existing relationship between the two people, and the circumstances of the conversation. In either case, someone initiating small talk will tend to choose a topic for which they can assume a shared background knowledge, to prevent the conversation from being too one-sided. Topics can be summarised as being either direct or indirect.Ventola, E. (1979) \\"The Structure of Casual Conversation in English\\", Journal of Pragmatics 3: pp.267‚Äì298. Direct topics include personal observations such as health or looks. Indirect topics refer to a situational context such as the latest news, or the conditions of the communicative situation. Some topics are considered to be \\"safe\\" in most circumstances, such as the weather, sports, and television. Asking about the weather, however, should be avoided unless there exists a follow-up discussion. Otherwise, the conversation will stall, and it will be the conversation starter's fault. The level of detail offered should not overstep the bounds of interpersonal space. When asked \\"How are you?\\" by an acquaintance they do not know well, a person is likely to choose a simple, generalized reply such as \\"I am good, thank you.\\" In this circumstance, it would usually not be appropriate for them to reply with a list of symptoms of any medical conditions they were suffering from. To do so would assume a greater degree of familiarity between the two people than is actually the case, and this may create an uncomfortable situation.  Conversational patterns  A study of small talk in situations that involve the chance meeting of strangers has been carried out by Klaus Schneider.Schneider, K. (1988) Small Talk: Analysing Phatic Discourse, PhD thesis, Philipps-Universit√§t, Marburg, W. Germany. He theorizes that such a conversation consists of a number of fairly predictable segments, or \\"moves\\". The first move is usually phrased so that it is easy for the other person to agree. It may be either a question or a statement of opinion with a tag question. For example, an opening line such as \\"Lovely weather, isn't it?\\" is a clear invitation for agreement. The second move is the other person's response. In functional conversations that address a particular topic, Grice's maxim of quantity suggests that responses should contain no more information than was explicitly asked for.Grice, H. P. (1975) \\"Logic and Conversation\\", in: P. Cole & J. Morgan (eds.) Syntax and Semantics : Speech Acts, Vol.3, Academic, NY. Schneider claims that one of the principles of small talk contradicts the maxim of quantity. He suggests that politeness in small talk is maximised by responding with a more substantial answer. Going back to the example of \\"Lovely weather, isn't it?\\", to respond factually by just saying \\"Yes\\" (or even \\"No\\") is less polite than saying, \\"Yes, very mild for the time of year\\". Schneider describes that subsequent moves may involve an acknowledgement such as \\"I see\\", a positive evaluation such as \\"That's nice\\", or what's called \\"idling behaviour\\", such as \\"Mmm\\", or \\"Really?\\".  Gender differences  Speech patterns between women tend to be more collaborative than those of men, and tend to support each other's involvement in the conversation. Topics for small talk are more likely to include compliments about some aspect of personal appearance. For example, \\"That dress really suits you.\\" Small talk between women who are friends may also involve a greater degree of self disclosure. Topics may cover more personal aspects of their life, their troubles, and their secrets. This self-disclosure both generates a closer relationship between them and is also a signal of that closeness.Tannen, D. (1992) \\"How men and women use language differently in their lives and in the classroom\\", The Education Digest 57,6. By contrast, men's small talk tends to be more competitive. It may feature verbal sparring matches, playful insults, and putdowns. However, in a way these are also both creators and signals of solidarity; the men are signalling that they are comfortable enough with each other's company to be able to say these things without them being taken as insults.  Cultural differences  While Americans, in general, can easily pursue small talk with strangers, in some other cultures these conversations could be distinguished as a waste of time. Also, small talk rules and topics can differ widely between cultures. Weather is a common topic in regions where the climate has great variation and can be unpredictable. Questions about the family are usual in some Asian and Arab countries. In cultures or contexts that are status-oriented, such as China, Latin America and Japan,Hofstede, G. (2000) Culture's Consequences, revised edition, Beverly Hills, CA: Sage. small talk between new acquaintances may feature exchange of questions that enable social categorization of each other. Differences among members of various cultural groups in aspects of their attitudes to small talk and ways of dealing with small talk situations are considered to be rooted in their socioculturally ingrained perception of interpersonal relationships Cui, X.

Early life and career He was born in H√∏vik as the son of dean Oskar Albert Munck (1868‚Äì1956) and Mathilde Munthe-Kaas (1871‚Äì1906). He was also a great-grandson of Johan Storm Munch. He grew up in √òygarden, took his examen artium at Frogner School in 1916 and a degree in electrical engineering at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1921. In October 1925 he married Elisa Margrethe \\"Lisken\\" Anthonisen. Their son Oskar A. Munck became best known among their children. In 1924 he founded his own company, which came to be known as Sverre Munck Elektro-Mekanisk Industri. After a time of struggle, the company profited from the upward economic cycles of the late 1930s and the post-World War II period. The main products were cranes, elevators and tackles, but also trolleybuses and excavators. The company had production facilities in Bergen, Fusa, B√∏v√•gen, Hamar and Langesund, and also expanded abroad. Later career In 1946 Munck passed down the management of the company to his sons. He continued as chairman of the board. He was a local chairman and national board member of the Norwegian Engineer Association. In 1967 he bought the newspaper Morgenposten, which until then had been owned by the semi-secret libertarian organization Libertas. During Libertas' ownership, the former editor-in-chief Asbj√∏rn Engen had reportedly \\"politicized\\" the formerly \\"apolitical\\" newspaper. Munck's own political views has been described as idiosyncratic. He was a supporter of politician Bertrand Dybwad Brochmann during the 1930s. He was an opponent of national socialism, but also socialism and trade unionism. He was a strong proponent of individual \\"spiritual\\" development, and of a \\"quality democracy\\" instead of a \\"mass democracy\\". Norsk biografisk leksikon notes that \\"often, he was not understood\\" as a public debater. Similarly, his takeover of Libertas was not regarded well by everyone. The editor-in-chief who replaced Engen shortly before Munck's takeover, Christian leader Per Voks√∏, resigned with immediate effect in March 1967. Much of the staff followed. After a stint with Gunnar Kristiansen as acting editor-in-chief, Munck took over as editor, and sat until 1969. He was succeeded by Leif Husebye, sports editor who had remained with the newspaper during the 1967 tumults. Munck continued as newspaper owner, but died in January 1970 in Oslo. Morgenposten suffered from a downward trend, and ultimately went defunct in 1971.

It is the third highest skyscraper in the country after the twin towers of Parque Central Complex. The construction of the tower began in 1990 but was halted in 1994 due to the Venezuelan banking crisis. As of 2018, the building remains incomplete and unused. It was damaged due to two earthquakes on 21 and 22 August 2018. History=Construction and banking crisis= This tower in downtown Caracas is nicknamed \\"Torre de David\\" after David Brillembourg, the tower's main investor who died from cancer in 1993. During the banking crisis of 1994, the government took control of the building and it has not been completed since. The building lacks elevators, installed electricity, running water, balcony railing, windows, and even walls in many places. The complex has six buildings: El Atrio (Lobby and conference room), Torre A that is 190m tall and stands at 45-stories still includes a heliport, Torre B, Edificio K, Edificio Z, and 12 floors of parking. In 2001, the Venezuelan government made an attempt to auction off the complex, but no one made an offer. =Residence by squatters= Exterior of Centro Financiero Confinanzas (Torre de David) in December 2013. In the 2000s and 2010s, Caracas suffered from a housing shortage, with shortages amounting to about 400,000 Caracas homes in 2011. Construction of homes halted in Venezuela due to the fears of expropriations that occurred under the Bolivarian government while the government was also unable to build enough homes for Venezuelans. Citizens of Caracas soon began to occupy buildings surrounding the complex. The housing shortage led to occupation of the complex by squatters led by ex-convicts in October 2007, with over 200 families, representing about 40% of Caracas' \\"informal communities\\", taking over the center. Residents improvised basic utility services, with water reaching all the way up to the 22nd floor. They could use motorcycles to travel up and down the first 10 floors, but had to use the stairs for the remaining levels. The residents lived up to the 28th floor, with many bodegas, barbershops, beauty salons, and even an unlicensed dentist also operating in the building. Some residents even had cars, parked inside of the building's parking garage. The population grew to seven hundred families made of over 2,500 residents living in the tower by 2011 and had a peak population of 5,000 squatters. =Relocation= On 22 July 2014, the Venezuelan government launched so-called \\"Operation Zamora 2014\\" to evacuate hundreds of families from the tower and relocate them into new homes in C√∫a, south of Caracas, as part of its Great Housing Mission project. By June 2015, all of the residents were relocated to their new homes. Some of the government-provided homes designated for relocated tower residents were already occupied by squatters who had taken over the government facilities. =Possible future= The tower in 2014 draped with Bolivarian propaganda banners saying \\"Ch√°vez Lives\\" Alfredo Brillembourg, relative of the late David Brillembourg who was a main investor of the tower, founded Urban Think Tank, which call on international attention for developing \\"informal settlements\\". The group made a documentary on how to make potential improvements with the complex which won a Golden Lion at the 2012 Venice Architecture Biennale of the Venice Biennale. After relocation had proceeded in July 2014, newspaper Tal Cual reported that Chinese banks were interested in buying the tower and renovating it for its original use. On July 23, 2014, President Nicol√°s Maduro announced that the government had not yet decided what to do with the building, but was considering at least three possible options: \\"Some are proposing its demolition. Others are proposing turning it into an economic, commercial or financial center. Some are proposing building homes there. ...We're going to open a debate.\\" In April 2015, the head of the government of the Capital District, Ernesto Villegas, announced that the tower would be used temporarily as a center for emergency care. Villegas indicated that members of the National Guard, Fire Department, and officials from the Directorate of Civil Protection would be installed in the building to serve the public. However, in April 2016, it was reported that the Chinese bank proposal fell through and that the tower was not in use. Since then, the tower has remained incomplete. On 21 August 2018, the tower was significantly damaged by an earthquake which caused the partial collapse of the top five floors, resulting in the affected portion leaning outward by 25 degrees.

He entered the ISA (Instituto Superior de Arte) as a student in 1977, graduated in 1982, and studied until 1989, when he became a professor. He is very popular due to his unorthodox teaching methods, he sometimes leaves the Institute and the classes happen outside. Rene Francisco's determination to create interaction between students and professors led him to create Galer√≠a DUPP, Desde una Pedagog√≠a Pragm√°tica (through a pragmatic pedagogy) in 1989. Ren√© Francisco talks admiringly and expansively about the ISA, which isn‚Äôt for him only a school to learn to paint, but a school of ideas, where the professors try to shape the students. More than a few of Francisco‚Äôs former students, such as Alexandre Arrechea, Wilfredo Prieto and Duvier del Dago Fernandez, have gone on to achieve artistic prominence on their own. Ren√© Francisco is an artist who has done a lot for the cause of conceptual art and community development. His commitment to El Romerillo, one of Havana's most notorious slums, extends beyond artistic interest. In 2003 he received a grant from a foundation in Berlin that he decided to use to give an art project to the foundation and help residents of El Romerillo at the same time.

It was serialized in Sh≈çjo Comic magazine from 1984 to 1986. The individual chapters were collected in 12 tank≈çbon volumes published by Shogakukan between October 1984 and February 1987. The story follows the struggles of a teenage girl after she finds herself turning into a lycanthropy-leopard and having to battle her newly found predatory instincts. The series was adapted into 30-minute music video (original video animation) in 1988 and a series of six light novels from 1991 to 1992. It was also adapted into an 11-episode live- action Japanese television drama that was broadcast on TV Asahi in Japan in 1996. Purple Eyes in the Dark was awarded the 1987 Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh≈çjo manga category. Story Rinko Ozaki is a normal high school girl, but she has a fixation on a weird birthmark on her arm. Her biology teacher, Ms. Sonehara, has a peculiar interest in the birthmark, and it fires up when her childhood friend, Shin'ya Mizushima, tries to make a move on her. Not only that, Rinko also notices her eyes glow purple! The next day when Rinko is sexually assaulted, she finally discovers that her birthmark causes her to turn into a leopard. Characters ;Rinko Ozaki :A first year in high-school, she has a crush on her childhood friend Shin'ya Mizushima. When assaulted by some of her classmates, Rinko involuntarily transforms into a leopard and kills them. ;Shin'ya Mizushima :A third year high-school student, Shin'ya has known Rinko since they were very young. He first shelters Rinko after finding her unconscious after the deaths of their classmates. ;Kaoruko Sonehara :Rinko's biology teacher. Her and her father studied humans who could turn into beasts. She first suspects Rinko of being one of these humans after she sees her birthmark. She is a cruel woman who tries to conduct experiments on Rinko and even her sister Maiko, assuming that she can transform too because they have the same blood. ;Maiko Ozaki :Rinko's sister. She later dies when Sonehara experiments on her, thinking she too can transform. ;Professor Sonehara :Kaoruko's father, he also studied people who can transform into beasts. When he presents his evidence to the world of science, he is shamed and rejected, and in a state of madness sets himself on fire. Kaoruko douses the flames and he survives, but has succumbed to insanity. Kaoruko locks him in the basement of their villa home so that the world can presume he is dead instead of tainting his image and research with his insanity. ;Mitusgu Odagiri :A journalist who originally tries to expose Sonehara's research on humans that can turn into beasts, but he later pursues Rinko, and reveals that he has purple eyes too.

It is a shrub with spreading branches, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves and loose groups of red flowers, each on a short stalk so that the branch is visible between the flowers. Description Kunzea pulchella is a spreading shrub which usually grows to a height of between , often with few side-branches, the branches more or less hairy. The leaves are arranged alternately on a petiole up to long and have a leaf blade that is usually long, wide and egg-shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. Both sides of the leaves are silky-hairy. The flowers are arranged in loose groups of 6 to 14, each flower on a stalk long on the ends of branches which often continue to grow during the flowering period. There are leaf-like, egg-shaped bracts long and smaller bracteoles at the base of the flower and which fall off as the flower develops. The hypanthium is long and densely hairy on the outside. There are five hairy, pointed, triangular sepals long, which remain on the maturing fruit. The five petals are deep red, almost round and long. There are more than 70 bright red stamens long around each flower, the stamens three or four times as long as the petals. Some forms of the plant have white to pale cream-coloured flowers. Flowering occurs from June to November and is followed by fruit which is a broad, urn-shaped capsule, long with the erect sepals attached. The features of this species that distinguish it from others in the Myrtaceae are the red flowers, persistent sepals and deciduous fruit. The egg-shaped leaves and triangular sepals distinguish it from Kunzea baxteri which also has red flowers. The colour of the flowers is white in the east of the range, and pink forms occur at a north-south transition zone that includes Elachbutting, Frog Rock and Duladjin Rock. The white form may encourage pollination by nocturnal moths, supplementing the less reliable visits by the honeyeaters in the more arid region, Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley, who gave it the name Salisia pulchella and published the description in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 1966, Alex George revised the name to Kunzea pulchella and published the change in The Western Australian Naturalist. The specific epithet (pulchella) is the diminutive of the Latin word pulcher meaning \\"pretty\\", hence \\"beautiful little\\". Distribution and habitat Kunzea pulchella grows in sandy or clay soils, often near or over granite in open scrub. The species occurs at the granite outcrops of Western Australia, and amongst the most common shrubs of those features in the more arid wheatbelt and goldfields areas of the southwest region. The preferred site is a narrow fissure in granite, to which it will be tenaciously anchored. The species may assume a bonsai appearance as the aging sole resident of a minor flaw on the face of a granite outcrop. It grows over a widespread area in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Use in horticulture This kunzea is best suited to a climate with dry summers and wet winters but can be grown in eastern Australian states if grown from cuttings on Kunzea ambigua rootstock. Conservation Granite kunzea is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Department of Parks and Wildlife of Western Australia.

In 1912, Tetrode developed the Sackur‚ÄìTetrode equation, a quantum mechanical expression of the entropy of an ideal gas. Otto Sackur derived this equation independently around the same time.Walter Grimus,\\"100th anniversary of the Sackur‚ÄìTetrode equation,\\" Ann. Phys. (Berlin) 525 (2013) A32‚ÄìA35 link to article The Sackur‚ÄìTetrode constant, S0/R, is a fundamental physical constant representing the translational contribution to the entropy of an ideal gas at a temperature of 1 K and pressure of 100 kPa, where R is the gas constant. From Amsterdam, Tetrode corresponded with Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz and Paul Ehrenfest on quantum mechanics and wrote several influential papers on quantum mechanics which were published in the German physics journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik. In particular, the Machian notion that elementary particles only act on other elementary particles and not themselves was a key idea in the formulation of the Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman time-symmetric theory. Life Hugo Tetrode was a member of the rich, prominent Tetrode family. He was the oldest of the three children of Pieter Johan Conrad Tetrode, who served as director of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch national bank) from 1919 to 1934. Tetrode was born at Verlengde Vondelstraat 14 in what was then Nieuwer-Amstel but is now Vondelstraat 138 in Amsterdam. As a child, he lived on Amsterdam's canals, at Keizersgracht 573 and Herengracht 526. Tetrode left for Germany in 1911 to study mathematics, physics and chemistry at the University of Leipzig, but returned to Amsterdam a year later. In 1912, at the age of 17, he published his first research paper in the German physics journal Annalen der Physik. He published a total of six scientific papers, all on topics of statistical physics and quantum mechanics. He led a withdrawn life; it is said that Einstein and Ehrenfest once visited him in Amsterdam, but were sent away by a maid at the front door with the words Meneer ontvangt geen gasten (\\"Sir is not receiving guests\\"). Tetrode died at the age of 35, unmarried, after contracting a tuberculosis infection.

She was built for the P&O; company as the passenger and cargo steamer Tartar. The Navy purchased her in 1855 and she participated in several battles in Chinese waters, including having been sunk and recovered. The Navy sold her in 1866 and she went through several changes in ownership before she was broken up in 1876. P&O; company Tartar had a shallow-draught wooden hull, strengthened by diagonal planking and reinforced with iron scantlings.P&O; Heritage Ship Fact Sheet: Tartar. On 8 September 1853 she sailed from Southampton for the Far East where she was to provide a feeder service for the P&O; Line on the China coast. Cadiz towed Tartar for the first four days, but then Tartar completed the rest of voyage to Singapore mostly under sail. On 4 June 1854 Tartar sailed to the Paracel Islands to assist , which had run aground there on 26 May. Salvage efforts were abandoned on 10 June. Royal Navy Lieutenant Sholto Douglas commissioned Coromandel in October 1856 for operations on the Canton river. She served in the Arrow War (1856‚Äì1860) in China, firing the first shot of the war on 23 October 1856 during the capture of Canton. On 1 June 1857 she was at the Battle of Fatshan Creek, during which she ran aground. There she served as the flagship for Rear-Admiral Michael Seymour. From 2 July she served as a tender to . On 22 September she was under the command of Master William H. Vine. Coromandel was at all three of the battles of the Pei-ho or Taku Forts: First (1858), Second (1859), and Third Battle of the Taku Forts (1860). In the second, in 1859, she was sunk but was later raised, repaired, and returned to service. On 23 August 1859 she was the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Hope. On 25 October 1861 Coromandel was under the command of Lieutenant Duncan George Davidson and serving as tender to . From 29 October 1862 she was under the command of lieutenant Robert Peel Denniston and serving as a tender to . From 17 August 1863 she was under the command of Lieutenant George Poole. Euryalus participated in both the bombardment of Kagoshima on 16 August 1863 and the bombardment of Shimonoseki in September 1864; it is not clear whether Coromandel was in company. Later career The Navy sold Coromandel in 1866 to R. Byrne & Company, Hong Kong. In 1867 she was sold to Kishu, Japan, where her new owners reamed her Naruto. Glover & Co., of Hong Kong, purchased her in 1868, who converted her to screw propulsion. The company went bankrupt and she was sold to Wright & Co., of Nagasaki, who sold her to Iwatani Shozo, who sold her to Hunt & Co., managers in Japan for the Netherlands Trading Society. She then underwent extensive repairs. Fate In 1876 Hunt & Co. sold the vessel to shipbreakers. She had been laid up at Yokohama for some time during which her hull had suffered from white ants.

He left for the continent in 1601, travelling for his education to Paris, Orl√©ans, Tours and Saumur, where he stayed with Philippe de Mornay.Miles Kerr-Peterson, A Protestant Lord in James VI's Scotland: George Keith, Fifth Earl Marischal (Boydell, 2019), p. 108.

He went to London to attend court with his wife in 1610, staying for a year.Miles Kerr-Peterson, A Protestant Lord in James VI's Scotland: George Keith, Fifth Earl Marischal (Boydell, 2019), p. 109. Keith acted as his father's deputy in the Scottish parliament in June 1621 and succeeded to his father's earldom on the latter's death on 2 April 1623. He ratified his father's building of Marischal College by a charter of 1 October 1623 and attended James VI and I's funeral on 5 May 1625 at Westminster Abbey. He was made a baronet of Nova Scotia at the end of May 1625 and, on the new Scottish privy council's restructuring in March 1626, he was made a member of it. He also joined the Scottish council of war on 12 July 1626 and was put in command of three ships to transport troops to aid Christian IV of Denmark, Charles I's uncle. This caused tension with Scotland's lord high admiral, Alexander, earl of Linlithgow, but these were in the end resolved by Marischal's confirmation as commander of the king's navy in Scotland on 9 July 1631. He received Charles I on his entry into Edinburgh in 1633 after his coronation and then in 1634 fitted out another fleet, which he sent to the assistance of W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa.

IMPORTANT NOTE - This article appears to have its information on which William Keith is which, and its 5th, 6th and 7th Earl Marischals confused. Refer to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for 'Keith, William, SIXTH Earl Marischal (1614‚Äì1671), nobleman, was the son of William Keith, FIFTH Earl Marischal (c.1585‚Äì1635), and Lady Mary, daughter of John Erskine, Earl of Mar'. The confusion arises because in 1927 Thomas Innes revised the hierarchy to include the father of William de Keith (original 1st Earl Marischal), another William, who then became the 1st Earl. The subsequent Earls all moved up one, thus this William Keith (1585-1635) was originally 5th and became 6th. So it depends upon whether you are determining the line pre or post 1927.

It landed in December 1801 and, after initial success, ended in a French defeat at the battle of Verti√®res and the departure of French troops in December 1803. The defeat ended forever Napoleon's dreams of a French empire in the West.  Context  The French Revolution led to serious social upheavals on Saint- Domingue, of which the most important was the slave revolt that led to the abolition of slavery in 1793 by the civil commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel, in a decision endorsed and spread to all the French colonies by the National Convention 6 months later. Toussaint Louverture, a black former slave who had been recognized as Governor by France, re-established peace, fought off Spanish and British attempts to capture the island, and reestablished prosperity by daring measures. However, he went too far in hunting down governor Don Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a y Moreno (27 January 1801), who had remained in what had been the Spanish part of the island following the 1795 Peace of Basel. Toussaint had also challenged French imperial interests by promulgating a self-rule constitution on 12 July 1801, which declared himself governor for life. The isle of Hispaniola On 9 February 1801, after their defeat at Marengo, the Austrians split off from the Second Coalition and signed the Treaty of Lun√©ville with France. Naples then signed a peace treaty with the French at Florence and Russia under Paul I distanced itself from the coalition, with his successor Alexander I finally concluded a secret peace with Bonaparte on 10 October 1801. Britain was thus isolated and, after the first ministry of William Pitt the Younger fell on 13 March 1801, the new government began to consider making peace. Bonaparte (now First Consul) could thus concentrate on internal problems within France and its empire. His troops were idle and his officers eager for a chance for glory. In early 1801, Bonaparte decided to appoint his sister Pauline's husband, general Charles Leclerc, as head of a military expedition to reassert French authority over Saint-Domingue.Philippe R. Girard, \\"Liberte, Egalite, Esclavage : French Revolutionary Ideals and the Failure of the Leclerc Expedition to Saint- Domingue,\\" French Colonial History, Volume 6, 2005, pp. 55‚Äì77 Initially, Bonaparte planned to confirm the military ranks and lands acquired by Toussaint's officers, offer Toussaint the r√¥le of lieutenant of France, and guarantee freedom to the former slaves, while re-establishing Paris's authority over the island in the person of its capitaine g√©n√©ral. Histoire du consulat et de l'empire, faisant suite √† l'Histoire de la r√©volution fran√ßaise Page 185 Toussaint's two sons were then being educated in France and as proof to Toussaint of the French government's goodwill Bonaparte sent them back to their father with their tutor. By October, however, Bonaparte's opinion had shifted, as he interpreted Toussaint's July constitution as an unacceptable offense to French imperial authority. Henceforth, Bonaparte secretly directed Leclerc to disarm Toussaint's black-controlled government and deport his military officers to France. Bonaparte foresaw that Toussaint would probably put up resistance and so took all necessary measures to defeat him should that occur ‚Äì Toussaint had over 16,000 men available,5 000 in the north of the island, 4,000 in the west, 4,000 in the south and 3,000 in the Spanish province ‚Äì Histoire de l'exp√©dition des Fran√ßais √† Saint-Domingue sous le consulat de Napol√©on Bonaparte, page 33. so Leclerc was put in command of 30,000 men drawn from nearly all the French Revolutionary Armies as well as the disciplinary corps.Histoire du Consulat et du Premier Empire  Expedition  Villaret de Joyeuse Peace had not yet been conclusively signed with Britain (the Peace of Amiens would finally be signed on 25 March 1802) when on 14 December 1801 a French fleet of 21 frigates and 35 ships of the line (with one 120 gun ship) left Brest under Villaret de Joyeuse carrying 7,000‚Äì8,000 troops.Histoire de l'exp√©dition des Fran√ßais √† Saint-Domingue sous le consulat de Napol√©on Bonaparte, page 30. This fleet was followed by the squadron under contre-amiral Ganteaume which left Toulon on 14 February with 4,200 troops then by that under contre-amiral Linois which left Cadiz on 17 February with 2,400 troops. In the following months even more ships left France with fresh troops, including over 4,000 men from the artillerie de marine, a Dutch division and the Polish Danube Legion. Also included were a Spanish fleet of seven ships under Admiral Federico Gravina as well as a great deal of financial and material aid coming from Spanish Cuba. In total 31,131 troops were landed on Saint-Domingue, including some non-white figures such as Andr√© Rigaud and future Haitian president Alexandre P√©tion, both of whom Toussaint had expelled from the colony two years earlier in the War of Knives (after the Saint-Domingue expedition's failure, Rigaud would be imprisoned at the Fort de Joux by Napoleon, a few cells away from Toussaint himself). Admiral Louis-Ren√© Levassor de Latouche-Tr√©ville. The ships were due to join up in the Bay of Saman√°, which Villaret de Joyeuse reached on 29 January, closely followed by Latouche-Tr√©ville. Without waiting for Ganteaume and Linois, these two admirals divided up their combined fleets to arrive at different ports in order to surprise Toussaint. General Kerverseau was to land at Santo Domingo in the Spanish part of the island, General Jean Boudet was sent to take Port-au-Prince in ships under Latouche-Tr√©ville and Leclerc; Villaret de Joyeuse and Gravina sailed towards to Cap-Ha√Øtien. When Toussaint discovered the French ships in the bay of Saman√° he ordered Henri Christophe (head of the island's northern d√©partement), Jean-Jacques Dessalines (head of the western d√©partement) and Laplume (head of the southern d√©partement) to obey the squadrons' summons to a parley, to insist on a parley if none was offered, and (if a landing should occur) to threaten to destroy the towns and massacre the white inhabitants before retreating into the mountains.  Reconquest  Villaret arrived before Cap-Ha√Øtien on 3 February and an attack by land and sea began on 5 February. Christophe carried out his orders, setting light to the town and slitting the throats of part of the white population. On 6 February Rochambeau landed in the bay of Mancenille and captured Fort-Dauphin. Putting out the fires and putting up defensive works, Leclerc set up his main headquarters at Cap-Ha√Øtien before sending ships towards North America to resupply. During this time Latouche-Tr√©ville and Boudet took Port-au-Prince and L√©og√¢ne and obtained Laplume's surrender. Landing at Santo Domingo with 2,000 men, general Kerverseau took possession of a large part of the Spanish area of the island, then headed by Toussaint's brother Paul Louverture. The French part of the island In the first ten days the French occupied the island's ports, towns and a large part of the cultivated land. Taking refuge in the Arbonite massif, Toussaint was only left with a few brigades under generals Maurepas, Christophe and Dessalines. However, he also had a large number of white hostages. To dislodge him the French would have to overcome narrow gorges, impenetrable with thick tropical vegetation and ideal for ambushes. The squadrons under Ganteaume and Linois had arrived, however, with reinforcements and Leclerc still held his joker in the form of his own hostages, Toussaint's sons, both of whom carried a letter from Napoleon promising their father the role of Leclerc's deputy in command of the island if he surrendered. On 17 February Leclerc launched a simultaneous assault with the divisions he had formed. Rochambeau on the left set out from Fort-Dauphin towards Saint-Michel, whilst Hardy marched on Marmelade and Desfourneaux on Plaisance. At the same time general Humbert was to land at Port-de-Paix to climb up the Trois-Rivi√®res gorge, and Boudet move up from south to north. The aim was to surprise the enemy, force him to retreat to Les Gona√Øves and there encircle him. Despite the difficulties of the terrain and Maurepas's resistance, the plan worked well. On 23 February Desfourneaux's division entered Les Gona√Øves, then on fire. General Boudet occupied Saint-Marc, also on fire and filled with the blood of the throats cut on the orders of Dessalines, who managed to escape the trap. Maurepas and his 2,000 troops continued to resist but finally had to surrender to Humbert. The French forces besieging fort de la Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot were attacked in the rear by Dessalines then by Toussaint as they attempted to bring relief to the besieged, but the fort was finally forced to surrender and inside it were found large amounts of arms and munitions as well as many assassinated white residents. At Les Verrettes the French forces found a horrible spectacle. No longer able to follow the rebel forces' march, 800 men, women, children and old people had been killed, Histoire du consulat et de l'empire, faisant suite √† l'Histoire de la r√©volution fran√ßaise page 206 and the rebels there had also killed any prisoners they took. Running out of resources, the area controlled by the rebel forces became more and more restricted and the rebels more and more disheartened. Christophe offered to lay down his arms in exchange for being given the same lenient treatment as had been given Laplume and Maurepas and his surrender led to that of Dessalines and finally of Toussaint. Under house arrest, Toussaint was restored to his rank and properties by Leclerc. At the end of April and start of May order was re-established little by little on the island, trade resumed at the ports and the rebels (seemingly reconciled to their situation) held onto their lands and ranks.  French defeat  In retirement under house arrest at Ennery, Toussaint contemplated his revenge and saw the French forces (especially those who had only just arrived on the island) ravaged by his best ally, yellow fever, with around 15,000 dead in only two months. Toussaint continued corresponding with his leaders, encouraging them to be ever ready, although some of them did not want to restart the war, and warned Leclerc. Sensing danger, in June Leclerc called Toussaint to an interview, arrested him, put him on a ship and sent him to Europe, where he was held at the Fort de Joux. Martinique was returned to France by the Treaty of Amiens and the Law of 20 May 1802 confirmed that slavery would be continued there. News of the reestablishment of slavery on Guadeloupe reached Saint-Domingue and revolt threatened again. Leclerc judged it wisest to disarm the blacks, but this just made them more angry. At Basse- Terre on Guadeloupe, yellow fever had also broken out and on 3 September Richepanse died of it, to be replaced by Boudet. Rochambeau, who hated mulattoes more than blacks, succeeded to Boudet's post on Saint-Domingue. Toussaint's old enemy and rival Rigaud was ordered to embark for the United States of America. In the south of the island, where mulattoes were most numerous, they were equally offended and allied themselves with the blacks. The wind of revolt, blowing especially through the north, was also spreading in the south. Henri I, king of Haiti By August 1802, Leclerc's forces had begun to suffer from mass defections of black and mulatto troops. In October, the former rebel leaders Alexander Petion, Henri Christophe and Jean-Jacques Dessalines all deserted the French forces as well. The French forces, now numbering only 8,000 to 10,000 men and only just able to serve, were overwhelmed. After the recently defected Christophe massacred several hundred Polish soldiers at Port-de-Paix, Leclerc ordered the arrest of all remaining black colonial troops in Cap-Ha√Øtien, and executed 1000 of them by tying sacks of flour to their neck and pushing them off the side of ships. The French subsequently sent orders to arrest and imprison all the black troops in the colony still serving within the French forces. This included still-loyal officers such as Maurepas, who was drowned with his family in the harbor of Cap-Ha√Øtien on Leclerc's orders in early November. Taking refuge on Tortuga in an attempt to avoid yellow fever, Leclerc died of it on 1 November 1802. His wife Pauline Bonaparte had accompanied her husband to the island and, though she had not previously been a model of fidelity, his death threw her into despair ‚Äì she cut off her hair, put it in her husband's coffin, put his heart in an urn and had the rest of his remains repatriated to France. As the senior officer on the expedition, Rochambeau took over from Leclerc as supreme commander and tried in vain to suppress the new revolt. Rochambeau ordered 600 pit bulls from Cuba, and forbade anyone to feed them. The pit bulls were to live by eating only \\"negro meat\\" (viande des n√®gres). That led to larger revolts against the French, as a submissive slave diligently working in the fields would suddenly be devoured by dozens of hungry pit bulls. Today, the saying \\"manger la viande des n√®gres\\" still resounds deeply in Haiti and the world. Cap-Ha√Øtien seemed to be the last bastion of the anti-rebel forces and, when the rebels reached it, Christophe had already relieved one of the forts. Rochambeau recaptured it but at the height of the battle some 1,200 blacks being held prisoner on a ship in the bay threw its crew overboard. On 18 November 1803, near the Cap, the French were defeated at the battle of Verti√®res by the rebel general Jean-Jacques Dessalines and at the end of December the last French soldiers left the island. On their voyage back to France, Rochambeau was captured at the Blockade of Saint-Domingue by the British and then interned in Britain for nearly nine years as a parole prisoner.  Results  Little more than 7,000 to 8,000 of the 31,000 soldiers sent to Saint-Domingue survived and over 20 French generals died. On 1 January 1804 Dessalines proclaimed the colony of Saint-Domingue to be the second independent state in the Americas, under the name of Haiti, and was first made governor general for life before (on 6 October 1804) being crowned emperor as Jacques I. He massacred the last French colonists left on Haiti at the 1804 Haiti Massacre and followed a system of \\"caporalisme agraire\\" or serfdom that did not include slavery per se but was still aimed at maintaining sugar industry profits by force. Dessalines was assassinated on 17 October 1806 and the country split into a kingdom in the north under Christophe as Henri I and a republic in the south under Alexandre P√©tion. In 1826 Charles X of France demanded an indemnity of 150 million gold francs from the young republic in return for France recognising its independence. This debt to France was reduced to 90 million in 1838 and was finally paid off by the mid-20th century.  See also  * Reconquista (Santo Domingo), 1808‚Äì1809 * C.L.R.

Life and times=Early life and his rise in the UOM= Lorenzo Marcelo Miguel was born and raised in the working-class borough of Villa Lugano in Buenos Aires. Entering the labor force in 1945 as a peon in his neighborhood's CAMEA steel mill, Miguel took up amateur boxing as a pastime, winning 13 of the 19 matches he fought in; a knockout defeat at Buenos Aires' famed Luna Park led him to abandon the pursuit, however. His election as shop steward by his coworkers at CAMEA in 1952 first brought him to the attention of the leadership at the Union of Metallurgy Workers (UOM), a growing body within the CGT and its 62 unions. Miguel married a CAMEA coworker, Elena Ramos, with whom he has two children, in 1958, though the violent 1955 overthrow of the populist President Juan Per√≥n led to official harassment of many in the labor movement, including Miguel (who spent much of the 1959-62 period in jail). Following President Arturo Frondizi's restoration of the CGT's right to political activity, the UOM elected the conciliatory Augusto Vandor as their leader in early 1962 and with him, the frugal Lorenzo Miguel as treasurer.Clar√≠n President Frondizi was forced to resign following his overtures to the CGT and Peronists, leading the exiled Per√≥n to oppose further dialogue with the Argentine government. This was opposed by Vandor, however, who began calling for a \\"Peronism without Per√≥n\\" until a 1966 coup d'√©tat that installed the anti-labor President Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a forced organized labor to rally around their exiled benefactor. Reconciled with Per√≥n and the leader of a UOM with over 400,000 members (a fifth of the CGT), Vandor was Argentina's most powerful labor leader when he was assassinated in a brutal June 1969 assault on his bureau at the UOM, who, following an acrimonious power struggle, elected Miguel as Secretary General in March 1970. He leveraged this victory to advance a rival within the UOM, Jos√© Ignacio Rucci, as the new Secretary General of the CGT, then the largest labor union in South America. The pragmatic Miguel thus turned a rival into an ally, while impeding the more combative Light and Power workers' leader, Agust√≠n Tosco, from rising to the powerful post. =The Peronist revival= This opposition to leftists within the labor movement intensified following Peronists' return to power in a March 1973 electoral landslide. Finding common cause with Per√≥n's influential private assistant, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, Miguel helped him finance El Caudillo (\\"The Strongman\\"), a fascist periodical that served as the public relations arm of L√≥pez Rega's newly organized death squad, the Triple A. Miguel's ties to the group were first exposed after June 20, 1973, when UOM heavies reportedly helped the Triple A ignite a riot at a massive gathering in honor of Per√≥n's return to Argentina. The UOM's presumptive role, though minor, forced Miguel attend a summit with his archenemies, the violently leftist Montoneros, in which he denied complicity and arrived at a mutual understanding. This cordiality was shattered, however, by the September 25 assassination of CGT head Jos√© Ignacio Rucci, an act for which the Montoneros took credit and which turned Miguel into their implacable enemy. The UOM then took part in a February 1974 police coup that led to the violent exit of leftist C√≥rdoba Province Governor Ricardo Obreg√≥n Cano, elected in 1973 as a Peronist (FREJULI) candidate, and Miguel helped persuade the aging Per√≥n to promote a right-wing Admiral and personal friend, Emilio Massera, as Head of the Navy, as well as to break with leftist Peronists shortly before his July 1974 passing.La Fogata UOM's Buenos Aires headquarters then became a base of operations for the Triple A, one of whose operatives, Alejandro Giovenco, died when a bomb intended for the leftist Peronist Youth detonated in his possession, instead. The unwanted attention this brought on Miguel was compounded by the discovery of the murder of Hugo Dubchek - Miguel's bodyguard - reportedly during a large movement of arms through the building, in whose furnace his remains were found. The November 1974 election of leftist shop steward Alberto Piccinini at ACINDAR's important Villa Constituci√≥n steel mill prompted Miguel to help the company lobby President Isabel Per√≥n (the leader's widow) for an armed intervention, which took place in a March 1975 police assault on the facility. The resulting arrests led to the \\"disappearances\\" of over 100 of some of the first victims of the later infamous Dirty War. Miguel's allegiance with L√≥pez Rega was strained when, in May, the mercurial death squad leader prevailed on Mrs. Per√≥n to install a prot√©g√© as head of the critical Economy Ministry, Celestino Rodrigo. Rodrigo quickly unveiled an austerity package which, attempting to deal with the country's yawning trade gap, shocked markets with a sudden halving of the peso's value, which paralyzed new construction and industrial spending and threw the CGT (particularly steelworkers) against the plan. This forced Miguel to lead the reluctant CGT leadership into a general strike in July, the first ever against a Peronist administration. Mrs. P√©ron yielded by dismissing Rodrigo and L√≥pez Rega, who was exiled to Spain; but the crisis led most public figures to call for her resignation, raising the possibility of a military coup d'√©tat. Advising her to advance elections five months, Miguel became the leading voice among the few who still supported seeing the President complete her term in office. His call for loyalty, a stance he described as \\"verticalist\\", lost its little support following a new, sharp devaluation of the shredded peso in February 1976 and a violent March 24 coup resulted in Miguel's arrest, along with the President and thousands of others.Diario R√≠o Negro =Persecution, return and twilight= Miguel counted on his former alliance with Acindar CEO Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz (appointed Minister of the Economy by the new regime) and on his friendship with Admiral Massera who, as Head of the Navy became the second-highest ranking public official in Argentina. These connections protected him from torture; but Miguel's accounts were frozen and he remained in prison for three years and spent another year in house arrest, leading him to sever his ties to the disloyal Massera. Emerging from his reclusion in 1980, and participated in the reconstitution of 25 of the more active unions into the CGT-Brasil (named after their Brasil Street address), supporting the replacement of Ra√∫l Baldassini with the more confrontational Sa√∫l Ubaldini. Miguel also retook the reins of an UOM hobbled by the massive industrial layoffs brought about by Mart√≠nez de Hoz's policies. These developments turned him into a vocal opponent of the dictatorship. Following the worst economic crisis since the great depression and the tragic invasion of the Falklands, the dictatorship called for elections in 1983. Facing a divided Justicialist Party (Peronists), Miguel's support of former Senate leader √çtalo L√∫der (an ally during his mid 1970s attacks on the left) was instrumental to the party's securing a nominee, albeit two months late. The rival centrist UCR pointed to this move as evidence that L√∫der was supported by the violent right and was, by extension, likely to grant the anxious outgoing military leadership blanket pardons for their \\"Dirty War.\\" The argument resonated among voters, giving UCR nominee Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n an ample victory (the UCR's first against a Peronist candidate).Todo Argentina: 1983 Following promises to the contrary, Alfons√≠n turned to increasingly conservative policies in the face of an inherited financial crisis and massive inflation (the world's highest, at the time). Miguel, who led a decimated UOM with a membership (150,000) less than half of its 1970s level, became increasingly marginal to the national discourse; by 1990, he was relegated to helping mediate conflicts between Ubaldini and Alfons√≠n's successor, President Carlos Menem. Menem, a lifelong Peronist who had been nominated partly with Miguel's last-minute support, quickly took to privatizing Argentina's array of State enterprises, a surprise move opposed by the CGT for the many layoffs it caused. The now compliant Miguel was compelled to call off a strike even after Menem's 1991 sell-off of SOMISA, then Argentina's largest steelmaker, and to support Menem's 1995 reelection bid. Following a decade of Argentina's first (and only) anti-labor Peronist administration, an ally of Miguel's, Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde was soundly defeated in the 1999 presidential election. Suffering from a worsening kidney ailment, Miguel considered giving his support to San Luis Governor Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√°'s (unsuccessful) candidacy for President; but died in a Buenos Aires clinic at the end of 2002. He was 75.

Calabria () is at the very south of the Italian peninsula, to which it is connected by the Monte Pollino massif, while on the east, south and west it is surrounded by the Ionian and Tyrrhenian seas. Jews have had a presence in Calabria for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. Calabrian Jews have had notable influence on many areas of Jewish life and culture. The Jews of Calabria are virtually identical to the neighbouring Jews of Sicily but are considered separate. However, the Jews of Calabria and the Jews of Apulia are historically the same community, only today are considered separate. Occasionally, there is confusion with the southern Jewish community in Calabria and the northern Jewish community in Reggio Emilia. Both communities have always been entirely separate. Early history The history of the Jews in Calabria is presumed to date back several centuries before the common era. While there is evidence of Hellenized Jews living in the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia, there is no direct evidence of a Jewish presence in Calabria, then known as Bruttium, until much later. However, legends state that many Jewish captive slaves were brought to Calabria after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in the year 70. Other legends state that it was the Hellenized Jews from Egypt who introduced the Etrog to Calabria during the time of Magna Graecia. In fact, the prized Etrog known as the Diamante Citron also known as the, \\"Yanover Esrog, is still grown in Calabria to this day. The Calabrian town of Santa Maria del Cedro still features their Etrog heritage in its place name. It is believed by some Jews, especially the Chabad-Lubavitch, that Moses used a Calabrian Etrog during the first holiday of Sukkot books.google.com A Kosher Liqueur made from Calabrian etrogim is commercially available.chowhound.chow.com Today in Israel, one of the most cultivated trees used for reforestation is known as the Calabrian Pine www.wildflowers.co.il The Mishna, in the order of Moed, Eruvin 42-43, makes an undated reference to the ancient Calabrian settlement of Brindisi, also known as Plandarsin. It was in Brindisi/Plandarsin that Rabbis Gamliel, Akiva, and other Tannaim debate oral law concerning personal travel during Shabbat. The first dated mentioning of Jewish communities in Calabria were by Roman officials in the service of the Western Emperor Honorius in the year 398. Some ancient towns known to have had a Jewish community were Reggio (Rhegion) and Catanzaro (Katantheros). Today some physical remnants of the ancient Calabrian Jewish community still survives. For example, the remains of the 4th century, Bova Marina Synagogue are located in the town of Bova Marina Another example is an inscription that mentions Calabria in the Jewish catacombs of Monteverde in Rome. These catacombs were in use from the first to the 3rd century. Another popular legend states that after the Sack of Rome in 410, Gothic general Alaric carried his booty, including the Temple Treasure of Jerusalem, South with him on his way to Africa. When Alaric died suddenly while in Calabria, he was believed to have buried the Temple Treasure somewhere near the Calabria town of Consentia. In the year 925, an army of Fatimite Muslims, led by Ja'far ibn Ubaid, invaded Calabria which devastated the Jewish population. It was during this time that Shabbethai Donnolo, was made captive. He would later become the Byzantine court physician in Calabria, and wrote many of his most famous works on medicine and theology while in Calabria. Middle Ages During the early period of the Middle Ages, Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia forming the Catepanate of Italy were under Byzantine rule, and Calabria was an important commercial center. During this time the Calabrian Jewish population, estimated at around 12,000, flourished.www.lameziastorica According to some sources, some areas of Calabria may have had a Jewish population of up to fifty percent. Many Jews were prosperous merchants dominating such industries as silk trading and cloth dyeing.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Money lending was also an important source of revenue for the Calabrian Jews.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Many Jews of Calabria lived in special segregated neighborhoods known as La Giudecca. Remnants of these neighborhoods still exist in Calabrian towns such as Nicastro.www.lameziastorica.it At their height, the Jews of Calabria, along with the other Jews of southern Italy were second only to the Jews from the Iberian Peninsula. During the First Crusade, southern Italy, including both Sicily and Calabria fell to the Normans. For a time, this resulted in uniting both Jewish populations, as well as other Jewish communities in southern Italy under the flag of the Kingdom of Sicily. Norman conqueror, Robert Guiscard governed Calabria in 1061. Guiscard encouraged the Jews of Catanzaro to engage in several agricultural trades. In fact, unlike many of the Jewish communities of Western Europe, the Jews of Calabria largely escaped the atrocities associated with that period. Benjamin of Tudela mentioned the Jews of Calabria on his return trip to Spain around 1175. After several centuries of relative peace and prosperity under the rule of the Kingdom of Naples, the persecution of the Calabrian Jews started in 1288 with accusations of blood libel.findarticles.com Under Charles II of Anjou with the assistance of the friars of the Dominican Order, the decline of the Calabrian Jewish communities began. During this time many Calabrian Jews and their wealth began to move to other Jewish communities of France and Northern Italy. Meanwhile, other Calabrian Jews were pressured to convert to Christianity. These Jewish converts to Christianity in Southern Italy were known as Neofiti. In 1348, during the years of the Black Death, a Jew by the name of Agimet of Geneva, confessed under torture to poisoning the wells of Calabria among other places.

It was largely the work of the British statesman Duke of Newcastle, who considered an alliance with Austria crucial to prevent the further expansion of French power. It lasted from 1731 to 1756 and formed part of the stately quadrille by which the Great Powers of Europe continually shifted their alliances to try to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Its collapse during the Diplomatic Revolution ultimately led to the Seven Years' War. Background Duke of Newcastle was a prominent Austrophile and one of the architects of the Anglo- Austrian Alliance. In 1725 Austria had signed the Treaty of Vienna, offering material support to the Spanish in their efforts to try to take back Gibraltar from the British.Browning p.48 Britain was then allied to France, but the relationship was slowly declining, and by 1731, they would be considered enemies again.Simms p.215-221 When, in 1727, the Spanish besieged Gibraltar during the Anglo-Spanish War, British diplomats persuaded the Austrians not to assist the Spanish by offering a number of concessions. A humiliated Spain was forced to break off the siege and make peace.Browning p.55 A number of prominent Austrophiles had for some time been advocating a British alliance with Austria, as Austria was seen as the only country with land forces that could match the French on the Continent. Austrophiles received a boost when the greatest opponent of Austria, Lord Townshend was forced to resign from office in 1730. That cleared the way for a full rapprochement between London and Vienna and gave the Duke of Newcastle more control over British foreign policy. He was strongly convinced that an alliance with Austria was essential. Alliance Europe in the years after the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1727, the Austrians had agreed to suspend the Ostend Company, whose overseas trading had been a constant source of tension with the British. That laid the groundwork for the Treaty of Vienna, which instituted a formal alliance between the two powers. It was signed on 16 March 1731 by Prince Eugene, Count Sinzendorf, Count Starhemberg and the British envoy Earl of Chesterfield. One immediate result was the complete disbandment of the Ostend Company, which delighted the British government. Britain and Austria gave each other a reciprocal guarantee against aggression.Simms p.219 The British gave material support to the Austrians in the War of the Austrian Succession in the form of British troops and providing large financial subsidies that allowed Maria Theresa to secure the Austrian throne, in defiance of Salic Law. By 1745, Austria had appeared to be in serious danger of being completely overrun and partitioned by Prussia and France, but a British campaign against the French in Flanders drew away crucial French manpower, allowing the Austrians to counterattack. The British had also applied diplomatic pressure to persuade Prussia's Frederick the Great to agree a ceasefire at the Treaty of Dresden so that Austrian could turn its full attention against the French.Simms p.338 The Alliance was sometimes severely strained. The Austrians believed the British had done little to prevent France from occupying Brussels in 1746, which led to a further increase of conflicts. The worst was during the Congress of Breda, aimed at negotiating an end to the war and leading to the eventual settlement at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. The British, hoping for a swift conclusion, were annoyed by Austria's slow progress in agreeing the terms. They eventually threatened to sign the treaty alone if Austria did not agree to it within three weeks.Browning p.154 Austria reluctantly signed the treaty. It was particularly disturbed to have little material gains for their efforts in the war, but the British considered the terms received by the French to be very generous. However, the omens looked good for the alliance. The Austrians had an enthusiastic supporter in Newcastle and apparently had no other major ally to turn to.Browning p.56 The British regarded the alliance as part of the Newcastle System to maintain the security of Germany by creating an alliance between Britain, Hanover, Austria and the Dutch Republic. Collapse In Austria, there remained some nagging suspicion that the British were not fully committed to the alliance. Britain's absence from the War of the Polish Succession and its failure to insist on a return of Silesia to Austria at the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle were highlighted as signs of Britain's bad faith. Essentially, it was believed that Britain was interested in the alliance only when it suited its own goals. One of the leading anti-British influences was Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz, who became Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1753. Maria Theresa of Austria. British support was crucial in allowing her to retain her throne during the War of the Austrian Succession. Still, she strongly distrusted the British. In 1756, suspecting that Prussia was about to launch an invasion of Bohemia and fearing that the British would do nothing to help them because of a preoccupation with a dispute with France over the Ohio Country, Austria concluded an alliance with its traditional enemy, France. Britain, left out in the cold, made a hasty alliance with Prussia, hoping that the new balance of power would prevent war.Anderson p.128-29 Unable to control its Prussian ally, Frederick the Great, who attacked Austria in 1756, Britain honoured its commitment to the Prussians and forged the Anglo-Prussian alliance. Although Britain and Austria did not declare war against each other, they were now aligned in opposing coalitions in a major European war. During the Capture of Emden in 1758, British and Austrian forces came close to open warfare. In spite of its efforts during the war, Austria was ultimately unable to retake Silesia, and the 1763 Treaty of Paris confirmed Prussian control of it. Aftermath Britain had been growing increasingly less favourable to Austria, and the Austrophiles in Britain saw their influence decrease during and after the Seven Years' War. Austria was by now seen as increasingly autocratic and resistant to the spread of British liberal democracy. In 1778, when France entered the American War of Independence to try to assist the American colonists to gain their independence, Britain sought to gain Austrian support for their efforts to put down the rebellion. Austria's entry into the war, it was believed, would have drawn off French troops that were sent to America. However, Austria refused even seriously considering the proposal. Britain and Austria later again became allies during the Napoleonic Wars, but they were both part of a broader anti-French coalition, and the relationship was nowhere near as close as it had been during the era of the Alliance. Once again, British subsidies became crucial to putting Austrian armies in the field, such as during the Flanders campaign of 1793‚Äì1794, when they received ¬£1 million.

American Rifleman (December 2008) pp.58-68 as a replacement for the Campo-Giro 1913/1916, which had also been chambered in 9mm Largo. It was the standard issue sidearm in the Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War and also saw service in Germany during World War II. The pistol was mass-produced and many examples still exist today. The Spanish Navy, along with the German Luftwaffe and the Chilean Navy primarily used the smaller variant Astra 300 and the Wehrmacht later altered the Astra 400 into the Astra 600 to better handle the 9mm Luger. The 400 was considered heavy as in order to handle the power of the 9mm Largo round in a blowback action the 400 had a reinforced slide and tough spring. History The Spanish War Ministry of King Alfonso XIII began tests in 1919 to replace the Campo Giro pistol as the standard military sidearm. The 9mm Largo Astra modelo 400, patented by Pedro Careaga, was selected for the Spanish Army in August 1921, and was also adopted by other Spanish Armed forces. Astra pistols were supplied to Republican Spain and to the Basque government which controlled the plant until the Bombing of Guernica in April, 1937. Astra pistols were subsequently produced for Nationalist troops, while Republican forces made approximately 22,000 copies of the pistol in Terrassa (marked F. Ascaso) and Valencia (marked RE for Republica Espa√±ola). Astra production after the civil war was for Nationalist troops except serial numbers 92851 to 98850 for Nazi Germany. Astra continued private production until 1950 even though in 1946 the Spanish military adopted the Star Model A as the standard sidearm. Spanish military inventories were sold to civilian wholesalers between 1956 and 1965. A total of around 106,175 pistols were produced. Mechanics The Astra 400 is heavy compared to many contemporary service pistols of the time like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 was designed to be safe to fire with a simple blowback action unaided by any breech-locking devices.Mcnab, Chris The Great Book of Guns (2004) pp.145 This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong recoil spring. It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard to cock. The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the trigger guard.Fowler, AnthonyPistols, Revolvers, and Submachine Guns (2007) pp.136 The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs. Variants Astra made some experimental variants of the 400 chambered in 7.63mm Mauser,Hogg, Ian Pistols of the World (2004) pp.111 .32 ACP, and .30 Luger. 9mm Largo rounds were often in short supply outside of Spain. Though several other 9mm cartridges like the 9mm Luger and .380ACP could feed, be fired, and eject successfully, this was a capability of questionable use where 9mm Largo ammunition was available as chronograph tests show considerably higher muzzle velocities and thus energies with the 9mm Largo than 9mm Luger and .380. The 9√ó23mm Steyr cartridge is more similar in dimension to the 9mm Largo than both the 9mm Luger and .380 and performs better as well. The Astra 600, a slightly shorter and lighter version of the Astra 400 that is chambered in 9mm Luger,Smith, W.H.B. Book of Pistols and Revolvers (1968) pp.374 was later developed for export sales, primarily to Nazi Germany. A smaller variant for both domestic and export sales, the Astra 300, was offered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. By the end of 1947 171,300 were made and were primarily issued to security forces of the Spanish Navy and the German Luftwaffe.

Composition In February 2003, Munger began to seek out material for a song cycle for a soprano soloist and the University of Alaska Percussion Ensemble. The United States was preparing for the invasion of Iraq and Munger became attracted to the song cycle convention known as \\"Songs of Love and War,\\" highlighting the human response to war. He began to research (mainly on the Internet) other composers' approach to the subject while searching for poems for the composition, and learned of Rachel Corrie's death the following month.Munger, Philip.

He later recalled: > \\"And, within days, three memorial websites for Rachel, two of them entirely > spontaneous, showed up. Memorials in many forms poured in. What interested > me were the poems and songs coming from all around the globe: School kids > and octogenarians, Jewel wannabes and established songwriters, student > writers and poet laureates, Jews and Muslims from all continents; > Christians, Buddhists, sectarians\\". Munger wrote to poets requesting permission for their poems to be used as lyrics for his cantata. When the texts had been selected, he wrote to Rachel Corrie's family asking their permission (which was granted) to proceed. Choosing the texts proved difficult, and four texts originally chosen were ultimately excluded from the work. Said Munger: > \\"My hope was that the progression of the texts would reflect an arc of hope > for peace emerging from a climate of hatred and violence, a climate which > produces such meaningless cruelty as the destruction of over 1,000 houses in > South Rafah in a hunt for smuggling tunnels which has yielded between five > and 60 such tunnels, depending on which source one uses\\".

Bryson wrote that Munger said two days before the public forum that he talked the situation over with Department of Music chairwoman Karen Strid, who felt the cantata's debut performance April 27 should go ahead as planned; she finally concurred, however, after Munger argued it should be cancelled. Munger further argued that anyone who went into the meeting thinking his \\"concerns for student safety to be exaggerated or unwarranted, and who also left the meeting feeling the same way, should not be making such safety decisions.\\"  World premiere in London  The cantata eventually had its world premiere on November 1, 2005 at the Hackney Empire Theatre in London, England.Camden New Journal.

On December 21, 2011, the CRTC approved the sale of CJNW-FM from Yerxa to Harvard Broadcasting of Regina, Saskatchewan, making it a sister station to CKEA-FM. Yerxa cited health issues as a factor in the sale. = Power 107 and trademark dispute = Former logo as Power 107 On August 15, 2019, the station flipped to a self-described \\"rhythmic classic hits\\" format as Power 107. The new format focuses mainly on pop, rhythmic, and pop rock hits from the 1990s and 2000s, along with some recurrents. The station changed its call letters to CKPW-FM to match the new branding. The \\"Power\\" brand was formerly used by CKNG during their run as a Top 40 station from 1991 through 2004. This prompted that station's current owner Corus Entertainment to file a trademark lawsuit against Harvard in October 2019, alleging that CKPW's branding and imaging was deliberately intended to trade upon the goodwill of the Power 92 brand, including use of a similarly-designed black and white logo, and use of a nearly-identical catchphrase for its \\"phrase that pays\\" promotion. Corus previously held trademarks on the titles \\"Power 92\\" and \\"Power 107\\" (the latter in relation to its former use by sister station 107.3 CFGQ-FM in Calgary), but they expired in 2015 due to non- renewal. It continues to hold a trademark on the previous Power 92 logo, which was renewed through 2033. On November 18, 2019, a Calgary court approved an injunction by Corus Entertainment, ordering Harvard to cease using the Power 107 name or any variation of it. Harvard stated that it would not attempt to continue pursuing the matter in court, and planned to seek suggestions for a new name from listeners (who would also be entered in a contest to win $1,007). CKPW rebranded as Play 107.1 on December 20, 2019.

It is a shrub with large, scarlet, bottlebrush-like flower clusters, making it popular as a garden feature.Condingup Peak Description Kunzea baxteri is a spreading shrub which usually grows to a height of between and has branches which are more or less hairy. The leaves are arranged alternately on a petiole long and have a leaf blade that is usually long, wide and oblong to elliptic in shape with hairs along the edges. The flowers are arranged in large, profuse, conspicuous, bottlebrush-like clusters, up to long and wide. The clusters usually contain between 16 and 30 flowers on the ends of branches which continue to grow during the flowering period. There are leaf-like bracts long, wide at the base of the flowers which fall off as the flowers open. The hypanthium is long and hairy on the outside. There are five hairy, linear to lance-shaped sepals long which remain on the maturing fruit. The five petals are deep red, round to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base and long. There are between 40 and 50 bright red stamens long around each flower, the stamens four or five times as long as the petals. Flowering is most prolific from July to September but often occurs as late as March, depending on rainfall. The fruit is a cup-shaped or urn-shaped capsule long with the erect sepals attached. The fruit release the seeds when mature, unlike many others in the Myrtaceae. The features of this species that distinguish it from others in the Myrtaceae are the red flowers, persistent sepals and deciduous fruit. The oblong leaves and narrow sepals distinguish it from Kunzea pulchella which also has red flowers. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1836 by Johann Klotzsch, who gave it the name Pentagonaster baxteri and published the description in Allgemeine Gartenzeitung. In 1844, Johannes Conrad Schauer revised the name to Kunzea baxteri. The specific epithet (baxteri) honours William Baxter, an English gardener who collected seeds and plants for British nurserymen. Distribution and habitat Kunzea baxteri grows in coarse sandy soil or laterite, often near granite outcrops in heath, scrub or woodland. It is found from the coast to areas up to about inland in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Ecology Scarlet kunzea is pollinated by honeyeaters and mammals which are attracted to its large red flowers. Conservation Kunzea baxteri is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This kunzea has been grown in gardens for many years. It is best suited to a climate with dry summers and wet winters. It is, however, adaptable to more humid areas and those with moderate frosts but requires a sunny or partly-shaded area with well-drained soil. In has been grown from cuttings on Kunzea ambigua rootstock.

He is best known for his campaign in 530 to crush Northern Wei. With only 7,000 troops, he invaded Northern Wei and conquered the regions of Henan and Shandong. However, he lost them again after being counterattacked by a Wei force ten times larger. Despite this, his success in conquering Northern China, albeit briefly, with only 7,000 troops made him a famous commander in Chinese history. Campaign against the Northern Wei In 530 AD, Chen Qingzhi, with only 7,000 troops, invaded Northern Wei, to make Yuan Hao Emperor of Northern Wei. At Liangguo, Chen's 7,000 men defeated Qiu Daqian's Northern Wei army of 70,000 men in a battle that lasted half a day, and Qiu Daqian surrendered. Chen then attacked Kaocheng, held by Yuan Huiye with 20,000 Northern Wei imperial guards. The city fell and Yuan was captured. Next, Chen attacked Xingyang, but was unable to take it because of its strong garrison of 70,000 troops. A Northern Wei army of 300,000 under Yuan Tianmu and Erzhu Tumo'er was arriving soon to relieve Xingyang, so Chen rallied his men with a speech: \\"Ever since we entered Wei territory, we have been capturing land, slaughtering many people in the cities we took. You have killed many peoples' fathers and brothers, and taken many people's children as slaves. Yuan Tianmu's soldiers are all our bitter enemies now. We have only 7,000 men, but the barbarians have over 300,000. Today, the only way for us to survive against the odds is to resolve to fight and die. The barbarians have too many cavalry for us to handle, so we cannot engage them on the plain. We should take advantage of their not having arrived yet, and attack Xingyang with all we've got, capture it, and then hold out. Let's not hesitate. It's time to take some heads!\\" Chen then led his troops to storm the walls of Xingyang, capturing it at last. However, more than 500 Liang soldiers were killed or injured. Before long, Yuan Tianmu and Erzhu Tumo'er arrived with their 300,000 troops, straight from Ji'nan (in Shandong). They surrounded Xingyang, but Chen led 3,000 cavalry out and smashed them (against odds of 100 to 1). Next, Chen moved west and attacked the Hulao Pass, and the Wei commanding general Erzhu Shilong abandoned the Pass and fled. Luoyang was left open to attack by Chen, and the Northern Wei emperor Yuan Ziyou abandoned the city and fled across the Yellow River to Henei. Chen was thus able to enter the capital city with his army and set Yuan Hao up as the new Northern Wei emperor. Unfortunately, Yuan Hao did not wish to remain a puppet of the Liang dynasty, and refused Chen's request for more elite Liang reinforcements. To prevent Chen from getting reinforcements behind his back, he even wrote to Xiao Yan claiming that the situation was under control and that it would be unwise to send more Liang occupation troops in, in case it aroused more resentment among the people of the captured Northern Wei cities. Xiao Yan thus halted the movement of reinforcements from the Liang-Wei border. To make matters worse, Chen's soldiers committed abuses and atrocities on the people of Luoyang, losing all local support, while Yuan Hao also proved an inept and self-indulgent ruler. Within less than two months of Yuan Hao's entry into Luoyang, the Northern Wei loyalist counterattack succeeded despite fierce resistance from Chen's army, and Yuan Hao fled from the city. Chen led his troops on an orderly retreat, pursued by Erzhu Rong. But his army was caught in a flash flood at the Mount Song River (outside Luoyang), and almost completely destroyed - most of the troops either died or deserted. Chen himself escaped back to the south after shaving his head and disguising himself as a monk. Modern Research Modern historians believe that the numbers of soldiers that the Chinese tradition states are exaggerated. New research concludes that Chen merely defeated Yuan's vanguard of 5,000 barbarian horsemen led by Erzhu Tumo'er, and another vanguard of 9,000 men led by Lu An. Yuan Tianmu's 300,000 men never arrived at Xinyang. Luoyang, the capital of Northern Wei, was taken by Yuan Hao rather than Chen. Yuan Hao wasn't a puppet of Chen and probably had a bigger army. Yuan Tianmu debated with his staff and court dignitaries on whether to take Luoyang back right away, or to follow the fleeing Wei emperor north which he went with. There was no mention of Xingyang. Two months later, Northern Wei's first general, Erzhu Rong, came back with a large force to retake Luoyang. Chen was of course unable to stop that. The story of 3,000 versus 300,000 was in the Book of Liang, a version of history written by Chen's side. Records from Wei's side did not mention the same battle.

It formed part of the stately quadrille in which the Great Powers of Europe repeatedly switched partners to try to build a superior alliance.  Creation  Following the end of the War of the Spanish Succession by the Treaty of Utrecht, British and French interests converged as they wished to stop the expansion of Spanish and Russian power. Although British Whig politicians had attacked the Treaty of Utrecht under the slogan \\"No Peace Without Spain\\", given it seemingly placed Spain under French control, they soon developed close relations with Paris having returned to power following the Hanoverian succession. France faced an uncertain succession, as their King Louis XV was currently young and childless. Britain was wary of alienating the much-larger France. The two states co-operated during the War of the Quadruple Alliance to stop a Spanish attempt to conquer parts of Italy. Shortly afterwards they managed to check the Russian advance across the Baltic.  End  The birth of a Dauphin in 1729 began to dissolve the French interest in the alliance, as their future was increasingly secure. In Britain a group of Austrophiles suggested that Austria would make a better potential partner for Britain. The actions of the French Chief Minister Cardinal Fleury were increasingly hostile towards Britain. The French failure to support the British during the Anglo-Spanish War (1727‚Äì1729) convinced many that they were no longer a reliable ally but were instead returning to the traditional position of a rival. The end of the alliance was never formally declared, but by early 1731, it was widely considered to be over. In 1731, Britain, sensing the direction Cardinal Fleury was taking France, concluded an alliance with Austria. By 1742, Britain and France were on opposite sides during the War of the Austrian Succession and their colonial rivalry in North America continued. Some have suggested that between 1688 and 1815 Britain and France were 'natural enemies' and the period has become known as the Second Hundred Years' War, but the 17 years spent as allies has been used to challenge the theory that the two states were implacable enemies.

The following year, he was elected Mayor of Bootle He was selected as the Liberal candidate for Chester after the 1935 election The Liberal Magazine, 1938, Liberal Publication Dept, pp418, 523 but never fought the seat.

Rugby career Dixon, like Gus Risman and Billy Boston, was a product of South Church Street School in Cardiff's Butetown. Playing in the Cardiff RFC Youth team, he was already showing something of his future potential but was overlooked by Wales (RU) Youth. As a seventeen-year-old he signed for Halifax in 1961. Initially he played as a , providing many tries for his John \\"Johnny\\" Freeman, by coincidence also a former pupil of South Church Street School, but it was not until he moved to the back row of the pack in 1963 that he revealed his tremendous power. Dixon played left-, i.e. number 4, in Halifax's 10-0 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the 1963‚Äì64 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1963‚Äì64 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 2 November 1963. In 1964 he was a key player in the first Halifax side to win the championship since 1907. As Halifax's captain in the 1967 and 1968 seasons Dixon led the side by example and was rewarded with his first Great Britain cap in 1968. Transferred a few weeks later to Salford for a record ¬£15,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£431,500 in 2016), he played in the Challenge Cup Final of 1969 losing to Castleford. Had Salford won he would almost certainly have been awarded the Lance Todd Trophy. That same season he was the Championship's highest scoring forward with 20 tries. Dixon played in the Great Britain 1972 World Cup winning side and toured Australasia in 1974, playing in all three Tests against Australia (1 win, 2 losses) and all three in New Zealand (2 wins, 1 loss).

As an international he won 15 caps for Wales, and 14 for Great Britain. He played his last game for Salford in 1980, but played one last season in the Premiership winning Hull Kingston Rovers team during the 1980‚Äì81 season.

He left school at the age of 11 because of learning difficulties and was later diagnosed with dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder. His parents continued his education through homeschooling. He started making chocolates for friends and family and in 2005 he started his company Chokolit Ltd. to deal with the growing demand. Winner of \\" Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year Award \\" 2011 . He received the Lord Carter Award for excellence in the food industry, presented to him in The House Of Lords 2009, was nominated for a Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2007. He was also a finalist in the teen category of the 2007 Enterprising Young Brits Awards. Louis is now an active motivational speaker and business consultant. Early life and education Louis Barnett was raised by his parents Phil and Mary Barnett in the village of Kinver, Staffordshire. Besides his work as a chocolatier, he is a champagne connoisseur and an amateur photographer. Throughout school, Barnett struggled to meet the teachers' expectations. They were satisfied with his vocabulary and general knowledge, but they focused on his weak points like maths and written work. Because other children didn't understand him, he would get into fights and be the target of bullying. At the age of 11, after just six weeks of secondary school, his parents took him out of the regular schooling system and gave him a vocational homeschooling program. His problems were later discovered to be caused by dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder. His parents hired a tutor (Jan) who helped with his studies, but was also encouraged, by his parents to follow his interests. He decided to learn about chocolate and champagne. He has since taken up fencing to improve his coordination (which is affected by developmental coordination disorder). Career After a falconry experience day, Barnett spent 18 months working as a volunteer at a falconry centre. He started out cleaning and gardening, but was eventually trusted to fly the birds of prey in shows and corporate events. His experience resulted in the permission to keep his pet African eagle owl Jewl. One day he bought a book titled \\"Belgian Chocolate Cakes and Chocolate\\" from a nearby garden centre. He started by making chocolate mousse and cakes, but eventually he focused on making chocolates and he became the youngest person to go on a course (and get certified) at the Banbury branch of the prestigious Callebaut Chocolate Academy. and he also works as a public speaker. Chokolit Louis started making chocolates in his kitchen for friends and family, but when he started selling the chocolates to local businesses, he had to move the operation to the garage. Chokolit was founded in 2005 and funded with a local grant of ¬£5,000 and a ¬£500 loan from his grandparents to buy a special machine that regulates chocolate temperature. The name of the company was chosen because that was how he used to spell chocolate due to his dyslexia. Soon his parents' garage was too small to deal with the growing demand and production had to relocate to a new factory in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. The factory was officially opened by South Staffordshire MP Sir Patrick Cormack on 14 December 2007. The company's signature product is the edible chocolate box which Barnett created when he was 13 to cut down on packaging expenses chocolate handbags using 53% pure dark chocolate supplied by Callebaut. Barnett now works with his parents and exports his chocolates to many different countries around the world. Activism Barnett is involved in a lobby for the reclassification of palm oil In contrast to other vegetable oils which have been connected to the health and longevity of Mediterranean people, palm oil is saturated and not healthy. Despite this, palm oil is widely used in the confectionery industry which he believes devalues the product. It is also used as a bio fuel. He argues that the loss of rain forest to provide space for palm plantations causes the destruction of the only remaining habitat of Sumatran orang-utans and that together with the carbon dioxide formed by burning the oil it leads to a net increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In support of this effort he has released a range of chocolate bars called \\"Biting Back Bar\\" which he launched on 29 May 2008 at Chester Zoo, the first place to stock the bars. (PDF) The first bar, the \\"Orang-utan Biting Back Bar\\", contains dark chocolate bar and has a hint of orange. It is sold by Chokolit, and several British zoos. Early in 2008, the MP who opened Chokolit's Bridgnorth production facility arranged for Barnett to meet Prime Minister Gordon Brown and conservative leader David Cameron at the Houses of Parliament.

She was the prime author of the Novosibirsk Report and several books on the economy of the Soviet Union (specializing in agriculture) and in sociology of the countryside. She was a member of the Consulting Committee to the President of Russia from 1991 to 1992 and also a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Zaslavskaya was the founder of VCIOM and also its director in the years from 1987 to 1992. In 2000 she was the Laureate of the Demidov Prize and the honorary president of the Levada Center. Biography Tatyana Zaslavskaya was born in Kiev in 1927 and brought up in Moscow. She studied at the Physics Department of Moscow State University for three years, and then graduated from the Economics Department of the University in 1950. She finished her post- graduate study at the Institute of Economics of the USSR Academy of Sciences with the degree of Kandidat in 1956 under the supervision of Professor Vladimir Venzher (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –í–µ–Ω–∂–µ—Ä). In 1963 she joined the Novosibirsk Institute of Economics headed by Abel Aganbegyan (–ê–±–µ–ª –ê–≥–∞–Ω–±–µ–≥—è–Ω) to work in a command of young and talented scientists. In 1965 she did her Doctorate in Economics and in 1968 she was elected an Associate Member (—á–ª–µ–Ω- –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ—Å–ø–æ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ç) of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Research The analysis of the economic situation in Soviet agriculture led Zaslavskaya to the conclusion that the revealed problems cannot be explained without sociological analysis, which bordered with blasphemy within the canonical Marxist science, which postulated that the development of the society is derived from the economical relations, and not vice versa. At these times Soviet sociology was under the tight scrutiny of the Communist Party (from the position of bourgeois pseudoscience through a brief period of liberalisation during the Khrushchev Thaw to sharp criticism during the Leonid Brezhnev era). The remoteness and relative scientific freedom of the young department of the USSR Academy of Science at Novosibirsk allowed Zaslavskaya to do her research in sociology of the agricultural sector by studying the Siberian countryside, Altai Krai in particular. In the later years of the Soviet Union accurate detailed information regarding conditions in Soviet agriculture was considered a state secret when not censored outright. A major breach in security occurred in 1983 when the details of a classified paper, \\"for internal use only\\", the report from the closed conference in Novosibirsk by Tatyana Zaslavskaya regarding the crisis in Soviet agriculture, were published in the Washington Post.

In the USSR all copies of the ‚ÄúNovosibirsk manifesto‚Äù were withdrawn by the KGB. Later it became known as the Novosibirsk Report in the West and was often considered one of the first signs of perestroika. Although expressed in terms of Marxist theory, this paper‚Äîan outline of a proposed research project to study the social mechanisms of economic development as exemplifed in Siberian agriculture‚Äîwas sharply critical of current conditions.The Second Socialist Revolution, pages xii-xiii Zaslavskaya was the author of a number of works in Russian which deal with economics and social conditions in Soviet agriculture although some of her work was suppressed by Soviet censors. For example, The Methodology of Comparing Labour Productivity in Agriculture in the USSR and the USA, written together with M.I. Sidorova, was suppressed due to its pessimistic resultsThe Second Socialist Revolution, page 33 In 1988 Zaslavskaya came back to Moscow for the formation of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center VCIOM which she was the director of until 1992. Afterwards she became the honorable president of VCIOM and later the honorable president of the Analytical Center of Yuri Levada (the Levada Center since 2004). In 1993 she became the co- president of the Interdisciplinary academic center of social sciences (Russian: –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞). Since 1993 the ‚ÄúIntercenter‚Äù has been carrying out ten annual international conferences concerning the question: ‚ÄúWhere is Russia going?‚Äù under Zaslavskaya direction. Many representatives of different sciences (historians, jurists, sociologists, economists, political scientists, culturologists, and philosophers) participate in these conferences debating topics such as a better judgment of the post-communist transformation processes or modern problems and prospects of development of the Russian society. Zaslavskaya's arguments evolved over time. In the Second Socialist Revolution she imagined that the USSR was experiencing a democratic revolution that would make Russia genuinely socialist. In the next two decades she puzzled over the form and nature of the transition that actually took place in Russia arguing in 1999 that it was some kind of revolution but then in 2002 concluding that \\"there was no new social revolution in Russia.\\" She saw social change as occurring through crises involving \\"random transformation\\" as in the 1990s the Yelt'sin group lost control of the situation. This led her to try to devise various analyses of social groupings and models of change which tended to description and classification.T.Zaslavskaia, 'On the social mechanism of post communist transformation', Sociological Research, vol. 42 no.6, 2002, 00. 69-90.

This is different from visual acuity, which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example \\"20/20 vision\\"). A person can have problems with visual perceptual processing even if they have 20/20 vision. The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight, sight, or vision (adjectival form: visual, optical, or ocular). The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular biology, collectively referred to as vision science.  Visual system  In humans and a number of other mammals, light enters the eye through the cornea and is focused by the lens onto the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. The retina serves as a transducer for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. This transduction is achieved by specialized photoreceptive cells of the retina, also known as the rods and cones, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are transmitted by the optic nerve, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain. The lateral geniculate nucleus, which transmits the information to the visual cortex. Signals from the retina also travel directly from the retina to the superior colliculus. The lateral geniculate nucleus sends signals to primary visual cortex, also called striate cortex. Extrastriate cortex, also called visual association cortex is a set of cortical structures, that receive information from striate cortex, as well as each other. Recent descriptions of visual association cortex describe a division into two functional pathways, a ventral and a dorsal pathway. This conjecture is known as the two streams hypothesis. The human visual system is generally believed to be sensitive to visible light in the range of wavelengths between 370 and 730 nanometers (0.00000037 to 0.00000073 meters) of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, some research suggests that humans can perceive light in wavelengths down to 340 nanometers (UV-A), especially the young.  Study  The major problem in visual perception is that what people see is not simply a translation of retinal stimuli (i.e., the image on the retina). Thus people interested in perception have long struggled to explain what visual processing does to create what is actually seen. =Early studies= The visual dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) are shown. Much of the human cerebral cortex is involved in vision. There were two major ancient Greek schools, providing a primitive explanation of how vision works. The first was the \\"emission theory\\" of vision which maintained that vision occurs when rays emanate from the eyes and are intercepted by visual objects. If an object was seen directly it was by 'means of rays' coming out of the eyes and again falling on the object. A refracted image was, however, seen by 'means of rays' as well, which came out of the eyes, traversed through the air, and after refraction, fell on the visible object which was sighted as the result of the movement of the rays from the eye. This theory was championed by scholars who were followers of Euclid's Optics and Ptolemy's Optics. The second school advocated the so-called 'intromission' approach which sees vision as coming from something entering the eyes representative of the object. With its main propagators Aristotle (De Sensu), Galen (De Usu Partium Corporis Humani) and their followers, this theory seems to have some contact with modern theories of what vision really is, but it remained only a speculation lacking any experimental foundation. (In eighteenth-century England, Isaac Newton, John Locke, and others, carried the intromission theory of vision forward by insisting that vision involved a process in which rays‚Äîcomposed of actual corporeal matter‚Äîemanated from seen objects and entered the seer's mind/sensorium through the eye's aperture.) Both schools of thought relied upon the principle that \\"like is only known by like\\", and thus upon the notion that the eye was composed of some \\"internal fire\\" which interacted with the \\"external fire\\" of visible light and made vision possible. Plato makes this assertion in his dialogue Timaeus (45b and 46b), as does Empedocles (as reported by Aristotle in his De Sensu, DK frag. B17). Leonardo da Vinci: The eye has a central line and everything that reaches the eye through this central line can be seen distinctly. Alhazen (965 ‚Äì 1040) carried out many investigations and experiments on visual perception, extended the work of Ptolemy on binocular vision, and commented on the anatomical works of Galen. He was the first person to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes. Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) is believed to be the first to recognize the special optical qualities of the eye. He wrote \\"The function of the human eye ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different.\\" His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the line of sight‚Äîthe optical line that ends at the fovea. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal and peripheral vision. Issac Newton (1642‚Äì1726/27) was the first to discover through experimentation, by isolating individual colors of the spectrum of light passing through a prism, that the visually perceived color of objects appeared due to the character of light the objects reflected, and that these divided colors could not be changed into any other color, which was contrary to scientific expectation of the day. = Unconscious inference = Hermann von Helmholtz is often credited with the first modern study of visual perception. Helmholtz examined the human eye and concluded that it was incapable of producing a high quality image. Insufficient information seemed to make vision impossible. He therefore concluded that vision could only be the result of some form of \\"unconscious inference\\", coining that term in 1867. He proposed the brain was making assumptions and conclusions from incomplete data, based on previous experiences. Inference requires prior experience of the world. Examples of well-known assumptions, based on visual experience, are: * light comes from above * objects are normally not viewed from below * faces are seen (and recognized) upright. * closer objects can block the view of more distant objects, but not vice versa * figures (i.e., foreground objects) tend to have convex borders The study of visual illusions (cases when the inference process goes wrong) has yielded much insight into what sort of assumptions the visual system makes. Another type of the unconscious inference hypothesis (based on probabilities) has recently been revived in so-called Bayesian studies of visual perception. Proponents of this approach consider that the visual system performs some form of Bayesian inference to derive a perception from sensory data. However, it is not clear how proponents of this view derive, in principle, the relevant probabilities required by the Bayesian equation. Models based on this idea have been used to describe various visual perceptual functions, such as the perception of motion, the perception of depth, and figure-ground perception. The \\"wholly empirical theory of perception\\" is a related and newer approach that rationalizes visual perception without explicitly invoking Bayesian formalisms. = Gestalt theory = Gestalt psychologists working primarily in the 1930s and 1940s raised many of the research questions that are studied by vision scientists today. The Gestalt Laws of Organization have guided the study of how people perceive visual components as organized patterns or wholes, instead of many different parts. \\"Gestalt\\" is a German word that partially translates to \\"configuration or pattern\\" along with \\"whole or emergent structure\\". According to this theory, there are eight main factors that determine how the visual system automatically groups elements into patterns: Proximity, Similarity, Closure, Symmetry, Common Fate (i.e. common motion), Continuity as well as Good Gestalt (pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly) and Past Experience. = Analysis of eye movement = Yarbus, 1967) During the 1960s, technical development permitted the continuous registration of eye movement during reading, in picture viewing,Yarbus, A. L. (1967). Eye movements and vision, Plenum Press, New York and later, in visual problem solving, and when headset- cameras became available, also during driving. The picture to the right shows what may happen during the first two seconds of visual inspection. While the background is out of focus, representing the peripheral vision, the first eye movement goes to the boots of the man (just because they are very near the starting fixation and have a reasonable contrast). The following fixations jump from face to face. They might even permit comparisons between faces. It may be concluded that the icon face is a very attractive search icon within the peripheral field of vision. The foveal vision adds detailed information to the peripheral first impression. It can also be noted that there are different types of eye movements: fixational eye movements (microsaccades, ocular drift, and tremor), vergence movements, saccadic movements and pursuit movements. Fixations are comparably static points where the eye rests. However, the eye is never completely still, but gaze position will drift. These drifts are in turn corrected by microsaccades, very small fixational eye-movements. Vergence movements involve the cooperation of both eyes to allow for an image to fall on the same area of both retinas. This results in a single focused image. Saccadic movements is the type of eye movement that makes jumps from one position to another position and is used to rapidly scan a particular scene/image. Lastly, pursuit movement is smooth eye movement and is used to follow objects in motion. = Face and object recognition = There is considerable evidence that face and object recognition are accomplished by distinct systems. For example, prosopagnosic patients show deficits in face, but not object processing, while object agnosic patients (most notably, patient C.K.) show deficits in object processing with spared face processing. Behaviorally, it has been shown that faces, but not objects, are subject to inversion effects, leading to the claim that faces are \\"special\\". Further, face and object processing recruit distinct neural systems. Notably, some have argued that the apparent specialization of the human brain for face processing does not reflect true domain specificity, but rather a more general process of expert-level discrimination within a given class of stimulus, though this latter claim is the subject of substantial debate. Using fMRI and electrophysiology Doris Tsao and colleagues described brain regions and a mechanism for face recognition in macaque monkeys. The inferotemporal cortex has a key role in the task of recognition and differentiation of different objects. A study of the MIT shows that subset regions of the IT cortex are in charge of different objects. By selectively shutting off neural activity of many small areas of the cortex, the animal gets alternately unable to distinguish between certain particular pairments of objects. This shows that the IT cortex is divided into regions that respond to different and particular visual features. In a similar way, certain particular patches and regions of the cortex are more involved into face recognition than other objects recognition. Some studies tend to show that rather than the uniform global image, some particular features and regions of interest of the objects are key elements when the brain need to recognise an object in image. In this way, the human vision is vulnerable to small particular changes to the image, such as disrupting the edges of the object, modifying texture or any small change in a crucial region of the image. Studies of people whose sight has been restored after a long blindness reveal that they cannot necessarily recognize objects and faces (as opposed to color, motion, and simple geometric shapes). Some hypothesize that being blind during childhood prevents some part of the visual system necessary for these higher-level tasks from developing properly.Man with restored sight provides new insight into how vision develops The general belief that a critical period lasts until age 5 or 6 was challenged by a 2007 study that found that older patients could improve these abilities with years of exposure.Out Of Darkness, Sight: Rare Cases Of Restored Vision Reveal How The Brain Learns To See  The cognitive and computational approaches  In the 1970s, David Marr developed a multi-level theory of vision, which analyzed the process of vision at different levels of abstraction. In order to focus on the understanding of specific problems in vision, he identified three levels of analysis: the computational, algorithmic and implementational levels. Many vision scientists, including Tomaso Poggio, have embraced these levels of analysis and employed them to further characterize vision from a computational perspective. The computational level addresses, at a high level of abstraction, the problems that the visual system must overcome. The algorithmic level attempts to identify the strategy that may be used to solve these problems. Finally, the implementational level attempts to explain how solutions to these problems are realized in neural circuitry. Marr suggested that it is possible to investigate vision at any of these levels independently. Marr described vision as proceeding from a two-dimensional visual array (on the retina) to a three-dimensional description of the world as output. His stages of vision include: * A 2D or primal sketch of the scene, based on feature extraction of fundamental components of the scene, including edges, regions, etc. Note the similarity in concept to a pencil sketch drawn quickly by an artist as an impression. * A 2 D sketch of the scene, where textures are acknowledged, etc. Note the similarity in concept to the stage in drawing where an artist highlights or shades areas of a scene, to provide depth. * A 3 D model, where the scene is visualized in a continuous, 3-dimensional map. Marr's 2D sketch assumes that a depth map is constructed, and that this map is the basis of 3D shape perception. However, both stereoscopic and pictorial perception, as well as monocular viewing, make clear that the perception of 3D shape precedes, and does not rely on, the perception of the depth of points. It is not clear how a preliminary depth map could, in principle, be constructed, nor how this would address the question of figure-ground organization, or grouping. The role of perceptual organizing constraints, overlooked by Marr, in the production of 3D shape percepts from binocularly-viewed 3D objects has been demonstrated empirically for the case of 3D wire objects, e.g.Rock & DiVita, 1987; Pizlo and Stevenson, 1999 For a more detailed discussion, see Pizlo (2008).3D Shape, Z. Pizlo (2008) MIT Press) A more recent, alternative, framework proposes that vision is composed instead of the following three stages: encoding, selection, and decoding. Encoding is to sample and represent visual inputs (e.g., to represent visual inputs as neural activities in the retina). Selection, or attentional selection, is to select a tiny fraction of input information for further processing , e.g., by shifting gaze to an object or visual location to better process the visual signals at that location. Decoding is to infer or recognize the selected input signals, e.g., to recognize the object at the center of gaze as somebody's face. In this framework, attentional selection starts at the primary visual cortex along the visual pathway, and the attentional constraints impose a dichotomy between the central and peripheral visual fields for visual recognition or decoding.  Transduction  Transduction is the process through which energy from environmental stimuli is converted to neural activity. The retina contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer where transduction occurs is farthest from the lens. It contains photoreceptors with different sensitivities call rods and cones . The cones are responsible for color perception and are of three distinct types labelled red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which is embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own wavelength sensitivity) that respond across the spectrum of visible light. When the appropriate wavelengths (those that the specific photopigment is sensitive to) hit the photoreceptor, the photopigment splits into two, which sends a signal to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a signal to the ganglion cells, the axons of which form the optic nerve and transmit the information to the brain. If a particular cone type is missing or abnormal, due to a genetic anomaly, a color vision deficiency , sometimes called color blindness will occur.  Opponent process  Transduction involves chemical messages sent from the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one ganglion cell. There are two types of ganglion cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neurons constantly fire‚Äîeven when not stimulated. The brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the rate of firing of these neurons alters. Red light stimulates the red cone, which in turn stimulates the red/green ganglion cell. Likewise, green light stimulates the green cone, which stimulates the green/red ganglion cell and blue light stimulates the blue cone which stimulates the blue/yellow ganglion cell. The rate of firing of the ganglion cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color in the name of the ganglion cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green ganglion cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green ganglion cell. This is an opponent process. If the rate of firing of a red/green ganglion cell is increased, the brain would know that the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain would know that the color of the light was green.  Artificial visual perception  Theories and observations of visual perception have been the main source of inspiration for computer vision (also called machine vision, or computational vision). Special hardware structures and software algorithms provide machines with the capability to interpret the images coming from a camera or a sensor.

The most famous member of this family was the 16th-Century sculptor Willem Danielsz van Tetrode, who hailed from Delft. The coat of arms of the Tetrode family, showing three leaves of the yellow water-lily, is now used as the municipal coat of arms of Bloemendaal (which includes Overveen, formerly the estate of Tetterode). The family name refers to the medieval clearing of forest in the area of dunes directly west of Haarlem, in what is now Overveen, to make the land suitable for cultivation. Rode means \\"clearing of land\\" while Tet may have been the first name of the original owner of the land. The eldest known member of the family is Gerard van Tetrode, who in 1310 donated land in the centre of Haarlem to build St. John's monastery; the monastery's church still exists today as the Janskerk (St. John's Church). The family had a fiefdom called Tetterode in what is now Overveen, west of Haarlem. There they built a fortified house or castle called Saxenburg. The house was sketched by Rembrandt in 1651. Salomon van Ruysdael painted Haarlem from the dunes of Tetterode in the early 17th Century. The place name Tetterode disappears from maps around 1648. The Tetrodes were particularly prominent in Leiden, where members of this rich and influential family of brewers served as burgomasters and aldermen, sheriffs, militia officers and church officials. Aernt van Tetrode (circa 1430-1471), sheriff and priest in Wassenaar, is considered the founder of the South Holland branch of the family. His son Willem van Tetrode was a rich brewer who built a hofje for the elderly in Leiden, the Sint Stevenshofje (also called Convent van Tetterode). This 15th-Century hofje still exists today. Elisabeth van Tetrode was the grandmother of the Leiden- born painter Rembrandt (1606-1669). However, she was actually not a member of the Tetrode family but assumed the noble name because she had a cousin who had married into the Tetrode family.

European-Americans called him Cowkeeper, as he held a very large herd of cattle.  Names = Ahaya = The chief of the Alachua band of Seminoles was usually called \\"Cowkeeper\\" by the British while they ruled East Florida. William Bartram, who visited the Alachua Seminoles and has provided much of what we know about the man, refers to him only as \\"the Cowkeeper\\". John Richard Alden, in his 1944 book John Stuart and the southern frontier, gives Cowkeeper's Oconee name as \\"Ahaya\\". (\\"Ahaya\\" is a rare Seminole name.) Mark Boyd also states that the leader of the Alachua Seminoles was known to the English as \\"Ahaya\\" or \\"Cowkeeper\\". Some sources state that the Oconees moved to Florida under a chief named \\"Secoffee\\", and that it was Secoffee who was called \\"Cowkeeper\\". Kenneth Porter argues that Cowkeeper and Secoffee were different people, and finds \\"nothing to support the claim [that Cowkeeper was Secoffee] and much to disprove it\\". = Alachua = The name \\"Alachua\\" derives from la Chua, the name of the largest ranch in 17th century Spanish Florida. The center of the hacienda de la Chua was located on a bluff overlooking a sinkhole, now called the \\"Alachua Sink\\", that drains Paynes Prairie. There is evidence that the Timucua word for \\"sinkhole\\" was , meaning that the ranch was named after the sinkhole. The Spanish called a large area in the interior of Florida west of the St. Johns River, tierras de la Chua. English-speakers who ventured into interior Florida called the area \\"the Alachua Country\\". = Seminole = The name \\"Seminole\\" likely is derived from the Spanish , meaning \\"wild or untamed\\", as opposed to the christianized natives who had previously lived in the mission villages of Spanish Florida. Some of the Hitchiti- or Mikasukee-speakers who had settled in Florida identified themselves to the British as \\"cimallon\\" (Muskogean languages have no \\"r\\" sound, replacing it with \\"l\\"). The British wrote the name as \\"Semallone\\", later \\"Seminole\\". The use of \\"cimallon\\" by bands in Florida to describe themselves may have been intended to distinguish themselves from the primarily Muskogee-speakers of the Upper Towns of the Muscogee Confederacy (called the \\"Creek Confederacy\\" by the British). The term \\"Seminole\\" was first applied to Ahaya's band in Alachua. After 1763, when they took over Florida from the Spanish, the British called all natives living in Florida \\"Seminoles\\", \\"Creeks\\", or \\"Seminole-Creeks\\". While the name \\"Seminole\\" was commonly applied by whites to all Native Americans in Florida, even as late as 1842, at the end of the Second Seminole War, US Army officers referred to various bands in Florida as Seminoles, Mikasukis, Tallahassees, Creeks, and Uchees, with \\"Seminoles\\" or \\"Alachua Seminoles\\" often referring only to the people who had lived around the Alachua Prairie prior to 1813, and owed allegiance to Ahaya and his successors, King Payne, Bolek (Bowlegs) and Micanopy.  Early life  Ahaya was born to the Hitchiti-speaking Oconee, who lived in a town at a site now called \\"Oconee Old Town\\", on the Oconee River, in what is now central Georgia. In the late 1720s the Oconee people moved to the Chattahoochee River, among the Hitchiti- and Mikasuki-speaking Lower Towns of the Muscogee Confederacy. The Oconee move has been attributed to a desire by the Oconees to distance themselves from whites encroaching on their town and hunting grounds. After the decimation of the Apalachee and Timucua people and the collapse of the Spanish mission network in Florida at the beginning of the 18th century, many peoples of what is now the state of Georgia, including the Oconees, used Florida as a vast hunting ground. Ahaya may have become familiar with the lands surrounding the Alachua Savanna (now known as Paynes Prairie) on hunting trips into Florida. In 1740, James Oglethorpe, the governor of the Province of Georgia, mounted an invasion into Spanish Florida, laying siege to its capitol, St. Augustine. Ahaya, who had become chief of his town, led 45 men to join the siege. After their defeat in the Yamasee War (1715‚Äì1718) against the Province of Carolina, many of the Yamasee people moved to Florida and settled in the vicinity of St. Augustine. The Spanish government tried to entice peoples from the Lower Towns of the Creek Confederacy to move to unoccupied lands in Florida, but were unable to supply enough gifts to satisfy them. The bands of the Lower Towns found the gifts and trade goods of the British to be much more desirable than those of the Spanish, and many continued to join the British in raids into Spanish Florida.  In Florida  The Oconee became unhappy living among the Lower Towns of the Creek Confederacy, perhaps because too many close, sometimes hostile, neighboring towns made it hard to find fresh agricultural land when it became necessary to relocate to new fields. About the year 1750, Ahaya led his people south to Florida, intending to settle somewhere near the Atlantic coast. The Oconee's migration reached the country around the Alachua Savanna, or Paynes Prairie, where they stopped. The area around Paynes Prairie is part of the Middle Florida Hammock Belt, a series of mixed hardword and pine hammocks with the best soils in central Florida. The Oconee found abundant game and fish in the area, as well as many feral cattle and horses, descendants of the herds on Spanish ranches which had been abandoned early in the 18th century. The herds the Oconee gathered from those feral cattle led the British to call Ahaya \\"Cowkeeper.\\" The Oconee established a town, called \\"Alachua\\", \\"Latchaway\\" or \\"Latchewie\\", on the edge of the savanna or prairie. The new town of Alachua soon was one of the three largest established in Florida by people from the Muscogee Confederation. The Oconees in Alachua were joined by Hitchiti- speakers from the towns of Sawokli, Tomathli, Apalachicola, Hitchiti and Chiaha. The various Muskogean-speaking bands, who were coming to be known as Seminoles, continued to harass the Spanish, pushing them back into St. Augustine and San Marcos (on the Gulf coast south of the old Apalachee Province). Ahaya and his band fought the Yamasees and remnants of the Timucua, who were allied with the Spanish. A Seminole tradition held that the Seminoles had killed most of the Yamasee men in a battle near the St. Johns River and married their women. The Alachua Seminoles still owned many Yamasee slaves when Bartram visited them in 1773. In 1757, Ahaya visited the Governor of the Province of Georgia and expressed his hatred both for the Spanish and for any Indian tribes allied with them. He explained that he had had a vision that he would not find peace in the afterlife unless he killed 100 Spaniards. The smell of decaying fish and swarms of mosquitoes drove the Alachua Seminoles to abandon their original town site, and move to a new town, called \\"Cuscowilla\\", a couple of miles from the Alachua Savanna. A town named \\"Lockway\\" was reported to be on the edge of a savanna (presumably the Alachua Savanna) in 1767. This may have been the original site of the town.  Relations with British  In 1763, when Spain ceded Florida to the British following the Seven Years' War, in exchange for territory west of the Mississippi River, Ahaya was overjoyed. Ahaya traveled to St. Augustine in 1764 to meet with John Stuart, Indian Superintendent of the Southern Department of British North America. The new governor of East Florida, James Grant, convened a conference with towns of the Muscogee Confederation in 1765 at Picolata, near St. Augustine, resulting in the Treaty of Picolata. Representatives of 30 towns in the Muscogee Confederation attended the conference, with Cuscowilla and Apalachee Old Field (Tallahassee) being the only towns in East Florida represented. The British believed that the Lower Towns of the Muscogee Confederation controlled the land and people of Florida. The Treaty of Picolata ceded in Florida to the British. Cowkeeper was not present for the conference at Picolata, and Weoffke signed the treaty for Cuscowilla. Ahaya reportedly missed the conference because of family illness, but he may have been separating himself from the Muscogee Confederation. The British gave medals, two great and four small, to some of the chiefs at the conference, in proportion to their importance. In late December 1765, Ahaya traveled to St. Augustine with 60 of his people, and stayed there for eight days. Ahaya received a great medal and other gifts and provisions from the British. Governor Grant was impressed with Ahaya's intelligence, and reported that he and Ahaya had \\"parted on the best terms.\\" In 1767, two British traders were killed when they tried to interfere with Seminoles who were stealing cattle. The British called a conference to deal with the killings. The British wanted to maintain good relations with the Seminoles. Philoke, from Ahaya's town of Cuscowilla, who was the father of two of the Seminoles involved in the killing, was given a great medal by the British. In the early 1770s, Jonathan Bryan of Georgia hatched a scheme to acquire a large area of land in Florida. Bryan persuaded chiefs of the Lower Towns of the Muscogee Confederation to cede lands in Florida, including the area around the Alachua Savanna, to him. Ahaya was shocked when the bold man traveled as far south as Payne's Prairie to carve his name into a red oak tree, but his allies quickly intervened. Governor James Wright of Georgia informed the Lower Town Muscogee of Bryan's trickery, and Governor Patrick Tonyn of Florida issued an arrest warrant for him. The British felt it necessary to ask Ahaya and other chiefs in Florida if they intended to go to war over the issue. Bryan backed down, saying that he had not purchased a large amount of land, but had merely leased grazing rights to a small area. According to the Indian Superintendent John Stuart, Ahaya was no longer connected with the Muscogee Confederation by 1774. At the beginning of the American Revolution, the Muscogee towns (the \\"Upper Creeks\\") supported the British, while the Hitchiti- and Mikasuki-speaking towns, and other non- Muscogean-speaking groups (the \\"Lower Creeks\\") mostly gravitated to the emerging United States and to Spain. One exception was the Alachua Seminoles under Ahaya, by then the largest \\"Seminole\\" village in Florida, who remained loyal to the British. Ahaya always responded when called on by Governor Tonyn to help repel rebel invasions from Georgia, which were often led by the same Jonathan Bryan who had tried to grab the Alachua Seminole's land. In 1783, when the British ceded Florida back to Spain following defeat in the American Revolutionary War, Ahaya asked the British to take him with them. He also told the British that he would kill any Spaniard that entered his territory. After Ahaya's death in 1784, relations between the Seminoles and the Spanish improved.  Cuscowilla  In 1774, the naturalist William Bartram of Philadelphia traveled to Cuscowilla in the company of traders who had established a store there. Ahaya welcomed Bartam, called him Puc Puggee, or \\"the flower hunter,\\" and gave him free rein to explore his lands. Ahaya's people served Bartram a sweet \\"thin drink\\", and a jelly made from the roots of a local Smilax, related to sarsaparilla, and sweetened with honey. The Alachua Seminoles also consumed beef, and some pork and wild game. Cuscowilla had about thirty wood frame dwelling houses arranged around a town square, with a council house in the middle of the square. Several hundred people lived in the town, with others in outlying villages. Each house had a garden, growing maize, beans and squash. Common fields stretched from the town to the edge of the Alachua Savanna. They gathered coontie and wild potato. Bartram reported that Ahaya was waited on by Yamasee slaves. The Yamasee slaves at Cuscowilla spoke Spanish and wore Spanish-style crucifixes, indicating that they may have been previously resident at a Spanish mission village. According to Bartram, the Yamasee slaves were fairly well treated.

In engineering, a mechanism is a device that transforms input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement. Mechanisms generally consist of moving components that can include: * Gears and gear trains * Belt and chain drives * Cam and followers * Linkage * Friction devices, such as brakes and clutches * Structural components such as a frame, fasteners, bearings, springs, lubricants * Various machine elements, such as splines, pins, and keys. The German scientist Reuleaux provides the definition \\"a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion.\\" In this context, his use of machine is generally interpreted to mean mechanism. The combination of force and movement defines power, and a mechanism manages power to achieve a desired set of forces and movement. A mechanism is usually a piece of a larger process or mechanical system. Sometimes an entire machine may be referred to as a mechanism. Examples are the steering mechanism in a car, or the winding mechanism of a wristwatch. Multiple mechanisms are machines.  Kinematic Pairs  From the time of Archimedes through the Renaissance, mechanisms were viewed as constructed from simple machines, such as the lever, pulley, screw, wheel and axle, wedge, and inclined plane. Reuleaux focused on bodies, called links, and the connections between these bodies called kinematic pairs, or joints. To use geometry to study the movement of a mechanism, its links are modeled as rigid bodies. This means that distances between points in a link are assumed to not change as the mechanism moves that is, the link does not flex. Thus, the relative movement between points in two connected links is considered to result from the kinematic pair that joins them. Kinematic pairs, or joints, are considered to provide ideal constraints between two links, such as the constraint of a single point for pure rotation, or the constraint of a line for pure sliding, as well as pure rolling without slipping and point contact with slipping. A mechanism is modeled as an assembly of rigid links and kinematic pairs. Revolute pair cutaway view. =Links and joints= Reuleaux called the ideal connections between links kinematic pairs. He distinguished between higher pairs with line contact between the two links and lower pairs with area contact between the links. J. Phillips shows that there are many ways to construct pairs that do not fit this simple model. Lower pair: A lower pair is an ideal joint that has surface contact between the pair of elements, as in the following cases: * A revolute pair, or hinged joint, requires a line in the moving body to remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body must maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. * A prismatic joint, or slider, requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane parallel to this line in the moving body must maintain contact with a similar parallel plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. * A cylindrical joint requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body. It combines a revolute joint and a sliding joint. This joint has two degrees of freedom. * A spherical joint, or ball joint, requires that a point in the moving body maintain contact with a point in the fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom. * A planar joint requires that a plane in the moving body maintain contact with a plane in fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom. * A screw joint, or helical joint, has only one degree of freedom because the sliding and rotational motions are related by the helix angle of the thread. Higher pairs: Generally, a higher pair is a constraint that requires a line or point contact between the elemental surfaces. For example, the contact between a cam and its follower is a higher pair called a cam joint. Similarly, the contact between the involute curves that form the meshing teeth of two gears are cam joints. Dimensioned drawing of a slider-crank (left) and its kinematic diagram (right). Kinematic diagram A kinematic diagram reduces the machine components to a skeleton diagram that emphasizes the joints and reduces the links to simple geometric elements. This diagram can also be formulated as a graph by representing the links of the mechanism as edges and the joints as vertices of the graph. This version of the kinematic diagram has proven effective in enumerating kinematic structures in the process of machine design.Lung-Wen Tsai, 2001, Mechanism design: enumeration of kinematic structures according to function, CRC Press An important consideration in this design process is the degree of freedom of the system of links and joints, which is determined using the Chebychev‚ÄìGr√ºbler‚ÄìKutzbach criterion. Theo Jansen's Strandbeest, a group of planar walking mechanisms. Planar mechanisms While all mechanisms in a mechanical system are three- dimensional, they can be analyzed using plane geometry, if the movement of the individual components are constrained so all point trajectories are parallel or in a series connection to a plane. In this case the system is called a planar mechanism. The kinematic analysis of planar mechanisms uses the subset of Special Euclidean group SE, consisting of planar rotations and translations, denote SE. The group SE is three-dimensional, which means that every position of a body in the plane is defined by three parameters. The parameters are often the x and y coordinates of the origin of a coordinate frame in M measured from the origin of a coordinate frame in F, and the angle measured from the x-axis in F to the x-axis in M. This is often described saying a body in the plane has three degrees-of-freedom. The pure rotation of a hinge and the linear translation of a slider can be identified with subgroups of SE , and define the two joints one degree-of-freedom joints of planar mechanisms. The cam joint formed by two surfaces in sliding and rotating contact is a two degree-of-freedom joint. See Theo Jansen's Strandbeest walking machine with legs constructed from planar eight-bar linkages Spherical mechanisms It is possible to construct a mechanism such that the point trajectories in all components lie in concentric spherical shells around a fixed point. An example is the gimbaled gyroscope. These devices are called spherical mechanisms.J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, Geometric Design of Linkages, 2nd Edition, Springer 2010 Spherical mechanisms are constructed by connecting links with hinged joints such that the axes of each hinge passes through the same point. This point becomes center of the concentric spherical shells. The movement of these mechanisms is characterized by the group SO(3) of rotations in three-dimensional space. Other examples of spherical mechanisms are the automotive differential and the robotic wrist. Select this link for an animation of a Spherical deployable mechanism. An example of a spherical deployable mechanism The rotation group SO(3) is three- dimensional. An example of the three parameters that specify a spatial rotation are the roll, pitch and yaw angles used to define the orientation of an aircraft. Spatial mechanisms An example of a Stewart Platform, a spatial mechanism. A mechanism in which a body moves through a general spatial movement is called a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which can be viewed as a four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by rod ends, also called spherical joints or ball joints. The rod ends let the input and output cranks of the RSSR linkage be misaligned to the point that they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a general spatial movement. Robot arms, Stewart platforms, and humanoid robotic systems are also examples of spatial mechanisms. Bennett's linkage is an example of a spatial overconstrained mechanism, which is constructed from four hinged joints. The group SE(3) is six-dimensional, which means the position of a body in space is defined by six parameters. Three of the parameters define the origin of the moving reference frame relative to the fixed frame. Three other parameters define the orientation of the moving frame relative to the fixed frame.  Linkages  Theo Jansen's kinetic sculpture Strandbeest. A wind-driven walking machine. A linkage is a collection of links connected by joints. Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement. Perhaps the single most useful example is the planar four-bar linkage. However, there are many more special linkages: * Watt's linkage is a four-bar linkage that generates an approximate straight line. It was critical to the operation of his design for the steam engine. This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels. Also see the article Parallel motion. * The success of Watt's linkage lead to the design of similar approximate straight- line linkages, such as Hoeken's linkage and Chebyshev's linkage. * The Peaucellier linkage generates a true straight-line output from a rotary input. * The Sarrus linkage is a spatial linkage that generates straight-line movement from a rotary input. * The Klann linkage and the Jansen linkage are recent inventions that provide interesting walking movements. They are respectively a six-bar and an eight-bar linkage.  Compliant mechanisms  A compliant mechanism is a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements. These mechanisms have many advantages, including reduced part-count, reduced \\"slop\\" between joints (no parasitic motion because of gaps between parts), energy storage, low maintenance (they don't require lubrication and there is low mechanical wear), and ease of manufacture . Flexure bearings (also known as flexure joints) are a subset of compliant mechanisms that produce a geometrically well-defined motion (rotation) on application of a force.  Cam and follower mechanisms  Cam follower Mechanism- Force is Applied From Follower To Cam A cam and follower is formed by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the cam and follower determines the movement of the mechanism. In general a cam follower mechanism's energy is transferred from cam to follower. The cam shaft is rotated and, according to the cam profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam. The main benefit of this type of cam follower mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.  Gears and gear trains  Gears are a type of mechanism. The transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. Illustrations by the renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the involute tooth yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio. Some important features of gears and gear trains are: * The ratio of the pitch circles of mating gears defines the speed ratio and the mechanical advantage of the gear set. * A planetary gear train provides high gear reduction in a compact package. * It is possible to design gear teeth for gears that are non- circular, yet still transmit torque smoothly. * The speed ratios of chain and belt drives are computed in the same way as gear ratios. (See bicycle gearing.) Mechanism synthesis The design of mechanisms to achieve a particular movement and force transmission is known as the kinematic synthesis of mechanisms.Hartenberg, R.S. and J. Denavit (1964) Kinematic synthesis of linkages, New York: McGraw-Hill ‚Äî Online link from Cornell University.

The brand Pokkali has received a GI tag from the Geographical Indications Registry Office, Chennai. Its resistance to salinity is remarkable. The rice is cultivated from June to early November when the salinity level of the water in the fields is low. From mid-November to mid-April, when the salinity is high, prawn farming takes over. The prawn seedlings, which swim in from the sea and the backwaters after the rice harvest, feed on the leftovers of the harvested crop. Sluice gates are used to control the water flow to the fields. The rice crop, which get no other fertilizer or manure, draw nutrients from the prawns‚Äô excrement and other remnants. Since the tidal flows make the fields highly fertile, no manure or fertilizer need to be applied; the seedlings just grow the natural way. In order to survive in the water-logged field, the rice plants grow up to 130-140 cm. But, as they mature, they bend over and collapse with only the panicles standing upright. Harvesting takes place by end- October. Only the panicles are cut about 30 cm from top and the rest of the stalks are left to decay in the water, which in time become feed for the prawns that start arriving in November‚ÄìDecember. Then, the second phase of the Pokkali farming, the prawn filtration, begins. The organically-grown Pokkali is famed for its peculiar taste and its high protein content. Farmers claim that the rice‚Äîits grains are extra large‚Äîhas several medicinal properties. In the past, Pokkali provided the energy to fishermen to stay at sea all day.

Early life and education Dudley attended the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Massachusetts. Subsequently, he earned a B.A. degree from New College of Florida in 1974, and a PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982. Career Dudley worked at Goldman Sachs from 1986 to 2007 where he held the position of chief U.S. economist. In 2007 he was hired by then-president of the New York Federal Reserve Timothy Geithner to oversee the department in charge of buying and selling government securities.

He is best known for discovering the Winchester Manuscript of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur in 1934.  Biography  Oakeshott was born on 11 November 1903 in South Africa, the second son of doctor Walter Oakeshott and his wife Kathleen. His father practised in Lydenburg, Transvaal. After the death of his father, his mother brought the family back to England. From 1917 Oakeshott was educated at Tonbridge School, where he eventually became School Captain (Head of School). He won a Classics exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford in 1922, graduating in 1926 with first class honours in Greats. After graduation, Oakeshott taught at various schools. His first post was at Tooting Bec School, London, followed by the Merchant Taylors' School in 1927. From 1931 to 1938 he worked for Winchester College as an Assistant Master, where in 1934 he made his discovery of the Winchester Manuscript in their Fellows' Library. From 1936‚Äì1937 he took a leave of absence from teaching to serve on an inquiry into unemployment sponsored by the Pilgrim Trust, the findings of which were written up as Men without Work by William Temple (1938). Following the enquiry, Oakeshott returned to teaching, becoming High Master of St Paul's School, London in 1939, where he supervised the school's evacuation to Crowthorne in Berkshire. In 1946 he returned to Winchester College as headmaster, where he remained until elected Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford in 1954. He remained in this post until 1972, but also served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford between 1962 and 1964.Oakeshott, Walter Fraser (1903‚Äì1987), Harpers Magazine. His portrait was made by Jean Cooke, who had been commissioned for the work by Lincoln College. Oakeshott was elected as a member of the Roxburghe Club for bibliophiles in 1949.Membership information, Roxburghe Club, UK. On 14 June 1980 it was announced that Oakeshott was to be awarded the honour of Knight Bachelor by the Queen, for \\"services to medieval literature\\". He also received honorary doctorates from the University of St. Andrews and UEA (1984). He was a distant cousin of the English political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. The Winchester Manuscript of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur All editions of the Morte prior to 1934 were based on the edition printed by Caxton. In June of that year, when the library of Winchester College was being catalogued, Oakeshott discovered a previously unknown manuscript copy ‚Äì this was one of the most important medieval manuscripts discovered in the twentieth century. Newspaper accounts appearing on 25 June, 26 June, 25 August and 27 September 1934 outlined to the public the unfolding story of the recognition that what Caxton had published in 1485 was not necessarily exactly what Malory had written. The \\"Winchester Manuscript\\" is regarded as being mostly, but not always, closer to Malory's original than is Caxton's text, although both derive separately from an earlier copy. Curiously, microscopic examination of ink smudges on the Winchester manuscript showed the marks to be offsets of newly printed pages set in Caxton's own font, indicating that same manuscript had been in Caxton's print shop. Unlike the Caxton edition, the Winchester MS is not divided into books and chapters. Indeed, in his preface, Caxton takes credit for the division. Eug√®ne Vinaver, an already-established Malory scholar, arrived in Winchester on 27 June asking to see the manuscript. Though he was encouraged to produce an edition himself, Oakeshott acknowledged Vinaver's editorial superiority and eventually ceded the project to him. But on the basis of his initial study of the manuscript, Oakeshott concluded as early as 1935 that the copy from which Caxton printed his edition \\"was already subdivided into books and sections.\\"Walter F. Oakeshott, \\"Caxton and Malory's Morte Darthur,\\" Gutenberg-Jahrbuch (1935), 112‚Äì116. Based on a more exhaustive study of the manuscript alongside Caxton's edition, Vinaver reached similar conclusions, and in his 1947 edition ‚Äì polemically entitled The Works of Sir Thomas Malory ‚Äì Vinaver argued strongly that Malory had in fact not written a single book, but produced a series of Arthurian tales which were internally consistent and independent works. The unity of the work has been a subject of some controversy among scholars since. Oakeshott published an account of his remarkable discovery, \\"The Finding of the Manuscript,\\" in 1963, chronicling the initial event and his realisation that \\"this indeed was Malory,\\" with \\"startling evidence of revision\\" in the Caxton edition.Walter F.

Early life Peter Carpenter was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Peter S. and Jane Carpenter, who had eight other children. The elder Peter Carpenter was a ship's pilot who owned his own boat and worked the Bristol Channel and Western Approaches. Carpenter attended the National School in Grange Town, Cardiff, until age 14. He was a rugby union star at school. He apparently worked for a printer immediately after leaving school. At age 17, he joined Spillers & Baker Company as a clerk; around 1910, he became a representative for them at their Stockport office. Infantry service He joined the Public Schools Royal Fusiliers in 1915 and was assigned to 24 Training Battalion as an instructor. He played rugby on his battalion team. He transferred to 19 Battalion and went to France with them as a sergeant on 14 November 1915. He also played for this battalion's rugby team until he broke his leg during a match. He was then transferred to the Home Establishment. From there, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps,Bernad & Franks (2003), p.80. being appointed a probationary temporary second lieutenant on 17 March 1917. Flying service Carpenter began his flying career with 5 Reserve Squadron; his first flight was on 21 March 1917. He soloed on 7 April after five hours dual instruction. He moved on to advanced training after accumulating another seven hours 40 minutes stick time. In this phase of training, with 34 Reserve Squadron, he crashed on 11 June after engine failure. He was unhurt. He graduated advanced training with 84 hours flying time, and was assigned to fly a Sopwith Camel with 45 Squadron on 14 September 1917. On 20 September, he dove on four Albatros D.Vs near Ypres, Belgium, fired 30 rounds at one, and drove it down out of the fight. After a short fight with the other three, he made his exit. He destroyed his next four opponents, becoming an ace on 15 November. 45 Squadron was then transferred to the Italian Front. Carpenter went with it, and destroyed three more enemy aircraft during January 1918. On 29 January, three days after win number eight, he went on home leave until 20 February. Upon his return, he was transferred to 66 Squadron as \\"B Flight\\" leader, effective 27 February. He marked his first day as a flight leader with his ninth triumph. On 30 March 1918 his flight, consisting of himself, Harold Ross Eycott-Martin and Alan Jerrard, was involved in the combat that resulted in the Victoria Cross award to Jerrard; Carpenter claiming one of the six Albatros fighters claimed destroyed in this fight (although Austro-Hungarian records indicate three aircraft were only damaged).Shores et.al.

They are the only Australian members of Gekkonidae to lack claws, the endemic genus is also the smallest in size.  Description  Smaller geckos found in central and western Australia, the smallest of the Gekkota species found on the continent and notable for the absence of claws at the end of any the toes. An early osteological comparison to related taxa presented considerable and unusual variation, such as being clawless, but in particular the forked arrangement of phalangeal bones within the digits of the gecko. A genus, sometimes assigned to the Diplodactylidae family, whose tiny and superficially similar species have diverged in isolation at a range of habitats across a wide geographic area.  Taxonomy  The genus has been placed with the Diplodactylidae, a family allied to the Gekkota (geckos and limbless lizard species). This is a list of species recognised at the Australian Faunal Directory, the IUCN and elsewhere, *Crenadactylus horni ‚Äì Central Uplands clawless gecko *Crenadactylus naso ‚Äì Northern clawless gecko *Crenadactylus occidentalis ‚Äì Western clawless gecko *Crenadactylus ocellatus *Crenadactylus pilbarensis ‚Äì Pilbara clawless gecko *Crenadactylus rostralis ‚Äì Southwest Kimberley clawless gecko *Crenadactylus tuberculatus ‚Äì Cape Range clawless gecko Crenadactylus was erected in 1964 by the authors James R. Dixon and Arnold G. Kluge to separate the taxon described by John Edward Gray as Diplodactylus ocellatus in 1845 and referred to as a species of Phyllodactylus, the combination published by Boulenger. The authors identified the most remarkable characteristic of the new genus, the unique morphology of the phalange structures at the end of the digits. These later authors noted Gray's description of Diplodactylus bilineatus, specimens he had separated from the type at the British Museum, and placed this in synonymy with the name Gray had published just a few lines before. Another description published by Lucas and Frost, Ebenavia horni, was also referred to Dixon and Kluge's monotypic genus. In describing the new genus, Gray's note on the source of the holotype as \\"W. Australia\\" (Western Australia) could not be refined, so this was restricted to a nominated type locality at Darlington, Western Australia, inferred by comparison to specimens found at that location. Consideration of Crenadactylus as a single species, Crenadactylus ocellatus, was also recognised by various authorities as three to four subspecies. However, molecular evidence revealed the phylogeny of the genus indicated numerous 'hidden species', and a revision in 2016 of accepted and new descriptions recognised a total of seven species. A molecular analysis of northern populations in 2012 examined the reported ancient divergence and up to ten lineages in northwestern Crenadactylus, with indication of geographical ranges restricted to less than 100 km2. The study examined the conclusions of testing for cryptic species, published in 2010, within the poorly understood and rare populations of a purportedly monotypic species. The authors of the 2010 research had sought to test the ability of a genetic study to reveal hidden taxa, with implications for research and conservation of diversity, and the conclusion in this example was number of definable species was grossly underestimated; the authors comment on their surprise at the number of potential species discovered within a 'developed country'. The phylogenetic evidence supported the proposed divergence of populations during the Oligocene-Miocene period (circa 20‚Äì30 mya). A revision in 2016 of the genus, using genotyped specimens for a morphological study, elevated previous descriptions to the rank of species and published three new descriptions. The conclusion of the molecular and morphological revision acknowledged greater divergence within the group, and distinguishable species that have persisted in locations for millions of years.  Distribution and habitat  Prior to the reclassification of the Crenadactylus species, the population was recognised as occurring in a large distribution range that covered most of the western and central regions of Australia. The various species are found in habitat that includes the leaf-layer at the floor of woodlands, underneath rocks, in hummocks of Trioda vegetation in spinifex country, under logs and other dead woody litter, and beneath the rubbish piles introduced to their environment by human activity. The newly described species were sometime recognised as occurring in restricted ranges, becoming isolated and specialised within particular environments. The small size is a limiting factor to the species ability to move beyond the local ecology, but may have allowed them to persist in the environment with less vulnerability to the continent's climatic changes.

The Green Scapular (also called The Badge of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) is a Roman Catholic devotional article approved by Pope Pius IX in 1870. It is called a scapular due to its appearance, but is not descended from the scapulars that form part of the habit worn by religious orders.Ball, Ann. 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices, page 217, It can be more accurately described as a \\"cloth medal\\". The development of the green scapular is based on visions reportedly experienced in 1840 by Sister Justine Bisqueyburu, a member of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. Background Almost ten years after Saint Catherine Labour√©, a member of the same Congregation of the Daughters of Charity, reported several apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in 1830, at the motherhouse in the Rue du Bac, Paris, that resulted on the creation of the Miraculous Medal of Our Lady of Graces. According to Chris Maunder, the visions of the Rue du Bac inspired other similar accounts among the French Vincentian nuns during the 1840s.Maunder, Chris. Our Lady of the Nations: Apparitions of Mary in 20th-century Catholic Europe, Oxford University Press, 2016 A second Daughter of Charity, Sister Justine Bisqueyburu, reported a similar experience in 1840, that led to the creation of the Green Scapular. In 1846 Sister Apolline Andriveaut purportedly received a vision at Troyes, France, that formed the basis of the Red Scapular of the Passion. Justine Bisqueyburu=Early life= Justine Bisqueyburu was born on 11 November 1817 in Maul√©on, Lower Pyrenees, France, to Clement and Ursula Albine d'Anglade Bisqueyburu. Her father was a merchant. Orphaned at a young age, she was brought up by her maternal aunt. On January 28, 1840, during her retreat in preparation for entrance into the Daughters of Charity, Justine was in the chapel at Rue du Bac in Paris. While she was at prayer, the Virgin Mary appeared to her, dressed in a long white gown and a light blue mantle; her hair was not covered, and she said nothing. At the end of the retreat, the Virgin Mary appeared to Sr Justine again, and the vision recurred five times during the latter's novitiate. On each occasion, the vision was identical to the first; on each occasion, Our Lady said nothing. =Visions= Shortly after she had received the habit of the Daughters of Charity, Sr Justine was sent to teach the poor in Blangy. On September 8, 1840 (the Feast of the Nativity of Mary), while Sr Justine was at prayer, the Virgin Mary again appeared, holding in her right hand her heart surrounded by flames, and in her left a type of scapular consisting of a single piece of green cloth strung on green cords. On the cloth was an image of the Virgin as she had appeared to Sr Justine, holding her heart in her right hand. On the cloth's reverse was \\"a Heart all ablaze with rays more dazzling than the sun and as transparent as crystal\\". The heart was pierced by a sword, surmounted by a gold cross and with words in the shape of an oval around the heart: \\"Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us now and at the hour of our death\\". Sr Justine heard an interior voice say that the Virgin Mary wished the scapular to be promoted widely as an instrument in the conversion of souls. Sr Justine told her superior about the visions and, subsequently, her spiritual director, Jean- Marie Aladel, C.M.. =Later life= Sr Justine went on to serve in Constantinople. In 1856 she was sent to the military hospital at Valde-Grace in Paris, where she remained for two years. In 1858 she was commissioned to open the Military Hospital of Rennes; later that year she was placed in charge of a military hospital in Algiers, a position she held for nine years. In 1867, her superiors sent her to Italy in the service of the Papal Zouaves. After spending three days and three nights on the battlefield, she went to Rome to equip and organize three ambulances. She was held in high esteem at the Papal Court, were Pope Pius IX appreciated her valor, and occasionally allowed her to accompany him in his walks through the Papal gardens. To the end of her life, Sr Justine maintained silence about these visions, and spoke only with her superior and her spiritual director about them. The Green Scapular was approved by Pope Pius IX in 1870. Sister Justine Bisqueyburu died on September 23, 1903. right Description The Green Scapular with a small medal of Saint Benedict. The devotional scapular is made of green fabric. The obverse has an image of the burning heart of Mary (without the chaplet of roses), pierced by a sword and dripping blood, above which is a crux immissa, encircled by the words \\"Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us now and at our hour of death.\\" The reverse shows a full standing image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the radiant Immaculate Heart. It differs from other scapulars in that it consists of only one rectangular piece of cloth instead of two. Devotional use Since it is not the emblem of a confraternity but simply a double image attached to a single piece of cloth, no investiture is necessary. The only requirement is that the Green Scapular be blessed by a priest and worn or carried by the person wishing to benefit by it. The Green Scapular is frequently given out at hospitals in the hope of obtaining physical healings. The Scapular may also be worn about the neck, placed under the pillow, kept in a wallet, or placed in one's clothing. The prayer, \\"Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us now and at the hour of our death\\", should with confidence be said for or by the person. When invoked under this title and through this holy image, the Virgin Mary is said to obtain great favours from her Son, especially in the areas of physical health, peace of mind and spiritual conversion. She would particularly obtain the conversion of those who had fallen away from the faith, and non-believers.Gersghty, Richard. \\"Green Scapular\\", EWTN, May 24, 2009 See also * Brown Scapular * Blue Scapular * Red Scapular * Fivefold Scapular * Miraculous Medal ReferencesExternal links * Society of the Green Scapular * The Green Scapular and Its Favors by Rev.

His career has been hampered by suffering various knee injuries in his career. Career Luz was born in Esslingen am Neckar. He started his career at Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, but played for the VfB Stuttgart II side. Then in 2004 he joined TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on loan in the South Regional. After his loan spell at Hoffenheim he returned to VfB Stuttgart II. In July 2005 he signed for FC St. Pauli in the Regionalliga where he scored 13 goals for the club. He was part of the side that reached the German Cup semi finals. After his good form for St. Pauli in an impressive run they called their legendary 'B series', in which all Cup opponents played started with the letter B (Burghausen, Bochum, Berlin, Bremen, Bayern), in December 2005, Luz, scored the goal of the month in the second round of the DFB-Pokal against Hertha BSC in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The goal was voted as the second best goal of the season. They reached the semi finals of the cup but were eventually knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich. In total, Luz scored three goals in the cup run against Bundesliga sides. For the 2006‚Äì07 season, he wanted to sign for relegated Bundesliga club 1. FC K√∂ln, however, the move fell through. He helped St. Pauli in the first half of their 2006‚Äì07 promotion season. In the January winter break, Luz moved to 2. Bundesliga side FC Augsburg. The move drew criticism from the St. Pauli fans who were disappointed to see their talisman leave the club. The move saw him contribute to a voluntary salary cut, which was seen as a contribution to the transfer fee. He made his debut on the professional league level in the 2. Bundesliga for FC Augsburg on 21 January 2007 when he started in a game against 1. FC K√∂ln. In the second half of the 2007‚Äì08 season, he was regularly used but playing mainly the role of the substitute and mainly only in the closing stages. During his time at Augsburg he picked up a serious knee injury which required surgery and kept him out for a sustained period. In total, he played 28 matches and scored three goals for the club. After that season he moved to league rivals Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen in 2008. However his time at the club was hampered by knee injuries which limited his appearances. He played nine times during the 2010‚Äì11 season scoring three goals. Oberhausen finished the season in 17th place and were relegated from 2. Bundesliga. On 30 June 2011, his contract ran out in Oberhausen, he started training with VfB Stuttgart II to keep himself fit. In August 2011, he joined Leeds United on trial along with former teammate Dennis Grote. In August 2011, he played for Leeds against Farsley F.C. in which he scored a hat-trick and was named by the club on the official website. Luz trial spell was extended on 11 August and he was set to play for Leeds in a behind closed doors friendly. But he left on 19 August 2011, after failing to win a deal with the Elland Road club.

Standing between Cuckoo Lane and Holy Trinity Church and in the alley known as Trinity Churchyard, it was a modern version of the historic market cross, such as was common in many medieval market towns. History=Early Medieval Cross= From medieval times, a cross stood at the southern end of Cross Cheaping, where it met Broadgate, about 100 metres from where the new one stands. This was the market place, and place of executions, and the earliest reference to a cross here is in a document dated 1300. This cross would probably have been carved from local red sandstone in the shape of a tall shaft topped with a simple cross, as was the style in the rest of the city and surrounding area. =Fifteenth-century Cross= On 24 May 1423 the court-leet ordered that a new cross be made and on the Thursday after Saint Matthias day in 1423 the mayor, Henry Peyto, held a meeting in St Mary‚Äôs hall which officially sanctioned the building of a cross in Cross Cheaping. The Leet contributed ¬£50 and the mayor also made a personal contribution to pay for it. The City Annals describe this cross as standing on eight pillars, and it stood for over a hundred years before it became unsafe and part of the upper section had to be taken down in 1537. =Tudor Cross= Tudor Coventry Cross as shown on Bradford's Map 1748/9 By 1506 discussions had already begun about replacing it, and a fund started. In 1541, a former mayor of London, Sir William Hollyes, who had been born in Stoke, Coventry, left ¬£200 in his will for a new cross, and building started the same year.Coventry Cross at British History Online, in Victoria County History, County of Warwick Volume 8, 1969 An indenture details how the cross was to be made, based on one in Abingdon, Berkshire, and made of ‚Äòseasonable free-stone of the quarries of Attleborough and Rowington‚Äô. It was to be built on the same spot as the old cross and on every pinnacle of the lower storey have ‚Äòa beast or fowl holding up a fan‚Äô. On each pinnacle of the second storey there was to be ‚Äòthe image of a naked boy with a target and holding up a fan‚Äô. The cross was 57 feet high, in four sections, with statues in the top three storeys: the lower of these holding statues of Henry VI, King John, Edward I, Henry II, Richard I and Henry. Above these were Edward III, Henry II, Richard III, St Michael and St George. The top storey held statues of St Peter, St James, St Christopher and two monks, with representations of Liberty and Justice at the highest point. Several of these statues were said to have been taken from Whitefriars and set in the cross. The new Coventry Cross was completed in 1544. It was brightly painted, and covered with gold. The city treasurer's accounts of 1545 include the entry \\"To Matthew Gilder for gildyng the crosse ¬£8 6s. 8p.\\" The nearby Golden Cross public house, erected some 40 years later at 8 Hay Lane, was probably named after it, as well as the 16th-century Coventry Cross public house at 29 Cross Cheaping.Locally Listed Buildings , Coventry City Council. Retrieved 2011-09-12. Henry VI as it stands in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. The City carried out repairs to the cross in 1608‚Äì9, and replaced a figure of Jesus with one of Lady Godiva. During the Commonwealth, as a result of puritan objections, six sets of royal coats of arms were removed from the cross in December 1650. According to the diary entry of John Evelyn on 3 August 1654, the cross was still in good condition. In 1688 major restoration work included re-gilding of most of the cross, and it was said at the time that on a sunny day people could hardly bear to look directly at it. The 1544 cross stood for two centuries, but then decay was once more setting in. A map drawn by Samuel Bradford in 1748/9 shows the cross in detail. But in 1753 and 1755 the top two stages were removed to avoid danger of collapse. In 1771 Coventry Council authorised the demolition of the cross, though some remains were still there after 1778 when a visitor to Coventry wrote that the decayed cross \\"...has no longer anything to please\\". The cross was then totally removed and its parts reused. Three of the statues still survive: two are currently in St Mary's Guildhall, while a statue of Henry VI is in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. Henry VI Henry VI was a figure of particular importance in the Coventry area. A Lancastrian king, he was put to death in the Tower. A cult of veneration then grew to 'Henry the Martyr', and despite early attempts to ban it (in 1479 the Archbishop of York banned veneration of his image), it continued to grow, encouraged by Henry VII. In 1494 Pope Alexander VI set up a commission of enquiry to look into miracles attributed to him and by 1499 his cult was even bigger than that of Thomas Becket. It was particularly strong in Coventry which supported the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, and which in 1456 was home to Queen Margaret, wife of Henry VI, who moved the court there as London grew increasingly Yorkist in sympathy. The veneration of Henry VI only came to an end with the Dissolution of the Monasteries. =20th/21st century= In the 1930s it was proposed to build a replica of the 1544 cross, but work did not begin until the 1960s, with the cross being finally unveiled in 1976, 100 metres from the original position. Based on its medieval precursor, it has four tiers and is surrounded by a flight of four steps. In 2007 the City Council considered relocating the Cross to form the centrepiece of a new public square at Ironmonger Row and the Burges, but a public consultation indicated that it should not be moved. In 2018 the council wanted to have it taken down, but the people of Coventry started a petition to stop this. This failed, and by January 2019 the cross had been removed.

Part of the ceremonial county of Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset occupies an area of , two-thirds of which is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but BANES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and the Chew Valley. The area has a population of 170,000, about half of whom live in Bath, making it 12 times more densely populated than the rest of the area. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, strict limitations are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. Bath and North East Somerset has 663 Grade I listed buildings, one of the highest concentrations in the country, covered by about 120 Historic England listings. The oldest sites within Bath are the Roman Baths, for which the foundation piles and an irregular stone chamber lined with lead were built during the Roman occupation of Britain, although the current building is from the 18th century. Bath Abbey was a Norman church built on earlier foundations, although the present building dates from the early 16th century and shows a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced parapet. The medieval era is represented by the remains of the city walls in Upper Borough Walls. Most of Bath's Grade I listed buildings are made from the local golden-coloured Bath Stone, and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is Georgian, which evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular during the early 18th century. This led to the entire city's designation as a World Heritage Site. Much of the development, and many of the buildings, were the vision of John Wood, the Elder. The Circus is seen as the pinnacle of Wood's work: it consists of three long, curved terraces that form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration for which was the Colosseum in Rome. The best known of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by Wood's son, John Wood, the Younger. Around 1770 the neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. The heart of the Georgian city was the Pump Room, which together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms was designed by Thomas Baldwin, a local builder responsible for many other buildings in the city, including the terraces in Argyle Street. Great Pulteney Street, where Baldwin eventually lived, is another of his works: this wide boulevard, constructed and over long and wide, is lined on both sides by Georgian terraces. Outside the city of Bath, most of the Grade I listed buildings are Norman or medieval- era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless, Gothic church towers. Manor houses such as Claverton Manor, which now houses the American Museum in Britain, and the 18th-century Newton Park, which has a landscape garden designed by Capability Brown, also appear in the list; Newton Park now forms part of the Bath Spa University. The most recent building is the agricultural Eastwood Manor Farm Steading, completed in 1860.

It was first serialised between 1 January 1963 and 14 June 1964 in the Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao. The novel is the first part of a trilogy, and is followed by Longfeng Baochai Yuan and Huijian Xinmo. Plot The novel is set in the Tianbao era (742‚Äì756) of the Tang dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. The emperor appoints the incompetent Yang Guozhong as chancellor because his cousin, Yang Yuhuan, is the emperor's favourite concubine. Nepotism and cronyism prevail as Yang Guozhong places his relatives and supporters in high- ranking posts in the Tang government, which becomes increasingly corrupt over time. The power-hungry barbarian An Lushan wins the emperor's trust through flattery and gets promoted to the position of jiedushi (military governor) of Fanyang. An Lushan wields great power in his hands and secretly builds up his military forces in preparation for a rebellion. In the wulin (martial artists' community), the outlaw leaders Dou Lingkan and Wang Botong compete fiercely for the position of chief of the wulin. Dou Lingkan and his brothers have the support of Duan Guizhang, a renowned swordsman who is also Dou's brother-in- law. On the other hand, Wang Botong cooperates with An Lushan to achieve his goal, recruits several followers, and sends his children to be tutored by martial arts experts. Duan Guizhang maintains a close friendship with Shi Yiru, a former bureaucrat. Their wives give birth to a boy, Duan Keye, and a girl, Shi Ruomei, respectively. An Lushan sends his men to bring Duan Guizhang to meet him but Duan was not in then, so Shi Yiru went in his place and ends up being held hostage in An's residence. Duan Guizhang and Tie Mole, Dou Lingkan's godson, go to rescue him. They fail and Shi Yiru dies while Duan Guizhang is seriously injured. They are saved from An Lushan's men by Nan Jiyun and Huangfu Song. Kongkong'er, one of Wang Botong's henchmen, shows up and steals the baby Duan Keye in order to force Duan Guizhang not to side with Dou Lingkan. Dou Lingkan is killed by Wang Botong's daughter, Wang Yanyu, in a fight and loses his title as the chief of the wulin. Tie Mole escapes with Nan Jiyun's help when the Dou family is destroyed and he vows to avenge his godfather. Duan Guizhang sends Tie Mole to learn martial arts from a reclusive master. Seven years later, after Tie Mole has achieved a certain level of prowess in martial arts, he returns to civilisation but finds himself stranded in the chaos of the An Shi Rebellion. Tie Mole embarks on a series of adventures. He undermines the support for An Lushan's rebel forces by capturing Wang Botong's stronghold, exposes the truth behind a 20-year-long mystery, and helps to clear Huangfu Song's name. At the same time, he also finds himself entangled in a love triangle with Wang Yanyu and Han Zhifen. He saves Emperor Xuanzong and flees with the imperial forces after the capital cities Luoyang and Chang'an fell to An Lushan's rebel armies. He is also involved in the incident at Mawei courier station, when the discontented Tang soldiers blamed Yang Guozhong for their plight, killed him, and demanded that Emperor Xuanzong execute Yang Yuhuan. The Battle of Suiyang is featured in the later chapters and many heroes, including Nan Jiyun, sacrifice themselves to defend the city from An Lushan's forces. Tie Mole, Han Zhifen and the other survivors continue their legacy by recruiting heroes to assist the Tang government in suppressing the rebellion.

In the mid-1990s, 5,000 to 8,000 Ukrainians lived in Paraguay, clustered in small communities near the southeastern city of Encarnacion, which borders the Argentine province of Misiones (the heartland of Ukrainian immigration to that country). The majority of Ukrainians in Paraguay work as farmers, cultivating rice, corn, wheat and yerba mate.Mykhailo Rubinec and Ann Lencyk Pawliczko. (1994). \\"Ukrainians in Paraguay.\\" In Ann Lencyk Pawliczko (Ed.) Ukraine and Ukrainians Throughout the World. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 455‚Äì458. History Ukrainians settled in Paraguay much later than they did in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, whose Ukrainian settlements date to the late nineteenth century.Serge Cipko and John C. Lehr. (2006). Ukrainian Settlement in Paraguay. Prairie Perspectives, Winnipeg: University of Winnipeg, pp. 31-46 The first large groups of Ukrainians who settled in Paraguay arrived from neighboring Argentina in the late 1920s during an economic crisis in that country. These migrants had been originally from the Volhynia region in northwestern Ukraine, and named their settlement Nueva Volyn or New Volhynia. They were joined, in the late 1930s, by immigrants coming directly from the Polesia, Volhynia, Galicia and Transcarpathia regions of Ukraine. Following World War II, several hundred Ukrainian refugees arrived from displaced- persons camps in Europe as well as from the Ukrainian exile community in China and Manchuria which was forced to flee Communist invasion. The origin of most of the Ukrainian settlers have resulted in Paraguay being one of the few countries in the Ukrainian diaspora outside the former Soviet Union where the majority of people belong to the Orthodox rather than the Catholic Church. The Ukrainian immigrants gave Ukrainian names such as Nova Volyn or Tarasivka to their settlements but were forced to change those names to Spanish-language ones by the Paraguayan government. By the late 1940s there were approximately 10,000 Ukrainians living in Paraguay., currently there is an estimate of 40000 Ukrainians living in Paraguay, according to the website of the Ukrainian World Congress. Subsequently, many Ukrainians from Paraguay, particularly the intelligentsia, emigrated to Argentina, Canada or the United States. Those who remained continue to attend Ukrainian Churches but have otherwise largely assimilated into Paraguayan society. Many of them have become prosperous, owning large tracts of land and leasing it to others.Welcome to Ukraine Magazine interview with Vasyl Ilashchuk, director of a documentary film about Ukrainians abroad, 2005 Society Encarnaci√≥n Itap√∫a is the heartland of the Ukrainian Paraguayan community. Encarnaci√≥n, which boasts a Ukrainian Community Centre, an Orthodox and a Catholic church, is the centre of Ukrainian community life in Paraguay. During the late 1930s the Ukrainian Prosvita society organized Ukrainian reading rooms, libraries and community centres. The Ukrainian youth organization operated until 1955. In the 1970s, during a ceremony attended by Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner, a statue to Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko was unveiled in the city. Generally, Ukrainian community and cultural life - with the exception of the churches - has declined in Paraguay due to the emigration of much of the intelligentsia to Argentina and North America. In terms of religion, over half of Paraguayan Ukrainians belong to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Approximately 30% belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the rest belong to Baptist, Stundite or Mennonite Churches. There are currently six Orthodox parishes in Paraguay.

The first king of the Wangchuck dynasty, Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck (1862‚Äì1926), was a charismatic figure who came to power against a turbulent background of incessant and complex feuding in that chaotic warrior state. He adopted as the unique symbol of his authority a satin and silk crown surmounted by the head of a raven.Bhutan celebrates coronation of new king The bird represents a form of Mahakala, Bhutan's guardian deity. The prototype of the founding monarch's Raven Crown had first been devised as a battle helmet for his father, Jigme Namgyel (1825‚Äì1881). Known as the Black Ruler, he had worn it in bloody struggles against his many rivals within the country and against the British who tried, unsuccessfully, to subdue him.

The Mendip district covers a largely rural area of ranging from the Mendip Hills through on to the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 11,000. The administrative centre of the district is Shepton Mallet. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. There are 90 Grade I listed buildings in Mendip. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. The greatest concentrations of Grade I listed buildings are in Wells and Glastonbury. In Wells these are clustered around the 10th-century Cathedral Church of St Andrew, better known as Wells Cathedral, and the 13th- century Bishop's Palace. Glastonbury is the site of the Abbey, where construction started in the 7th century, and its associated buildings. The ruined St Michael's church, damaged in an earthquake of 1275, stands on Glastonbury Tor, where the site shows evidence of occupation from Neolithic times and the Dark Ages. The Chalice Well has been in use since Pre-Christian times. Glastonbury Abbey had a wider influence outside the town: tithe barns were built at Pilton and West Bradley to hold tithes, and a Fish House was built at Meare along with a summer residence for the Abbot (now Manor Farmhouse). Medieval structures include Farleigh Hungerford Castle, fortified around 1370, and The George Inn at Norton St Philip, used as an army headquarters during the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, and then as a courtroom to try the rebels in the Bloody Assizes. Manor houses such as the 15th-century Seymours Court Farmhouse at Beckington and The Old Manor at Croscombe. Mells Manor followed in the 16th century and in the 17th century Southill House in Cranmore was built. Ston Easton Park and Ammerdown House in Kilmersdon were both completed in the 18th century. The most recent buildings included in the list are churches: the Church of St Peter at Hornblotton, built in 1872‚Äì74 by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson to replace a medieval church on the same site, and Downside Abbey at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, more formally known as \\"The Basilica of St Gregory the Great at Downside\\", a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery and the Senior House of the English Benedictine Congregation. The current buildings were started in the 19th century and are still unfinished.

Overall, the land has a Mediterranean climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The climate induces characteristic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub vegetation. Plant life immediately near the Mediterranean is in the Mediterranean Floristic region, while mountainous areas further from the sea supports the Sub-Mediterranean Floristic province. An important factor in the local climate and ecology of the lands in the Mediterranean basin is the elevation: an increase of elevation by causes the average air temperature to drop by 5 C/ 9 F and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into life zones of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation. Mediterranean vegetation shows a variety of ecological adaptations to hot and dry summer conditions. As Mediterranean vegetation differ both in species and composition from temperate vegetation, ecologists use special terminology for the Mediterranean altitudinal zonation: * Eu-mediterranean belt: 20- 16 ¬∞C (avg annual temperature) * Sub-mediterranean belt: 15- 12 ¬∞C * Hilly region: 11- 8 ¬∞C * Mountainous belt: 7- 4 ¬∞C * Alpine belt: 3- 0 ¬∞C * Subnival belt: 0- minus 4 ¬∞C Even within the Mediterranean Basin, differences in aridity alter the life zones as a function of elevation. For example, the wetter Maritime and Dinaric Alps have a North-Mediterranean zonation pattern, while the southern Apennine Mountains and the Spanish Sierra Nevada have a moderate Eu- Mediterranean zonation pattern. Finally, the drier Atlas Mountains of Africa and Taurus Mountains of the Near East have a Xero-Mediterranean pattern. Examples of each of these altitudinal zonation patterns is described below, by examining the climate and ecology of several locations around the Mediterranean Basin. Dinaric Alps of the Balkan Peninsula Orjen vegetation profile. ME: meridional (subtropic belt); NE: nemoral (temperate zone); BO: boreal (taiga zone); AL: alpine (tundra zone). An example of the wetter (or maritime) pattern comes from the Orjen range in the southeastern coastal Dinaric ranges of Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Above of elevation, the Orjen range lies in the Dinaric Mountains mixed forests ecoregion (as defined by the World Wildlife Fund). This ecoregion is known for its humidity, compared to other mountain ranges of the Mediterranean. Life zones in the Orjen range, with corresponding elevation ranges and indicator species are: * Eu-mediterranean (lower subtropical belt, ME=meridional) , Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera), Olive tree (Olea europaea). More humid habitats show Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis) and Oleander (Nerium oleander) formations. * Supra-mediterranean (upper subtropical belt) , Macedonian Oak (Quercus trojana) and Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis); above Turkey Oak (Quercus cerris) and Hungarian Oak or Italian Oak (Quercus frainetto). With more humidity: Forests of Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Downy Oak or Pubescent Oak (Quercus pubescens) and European Hophornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.). * Oro-mediterranean (temperate zone, NE= Nemoral) , Forest of Common Beech (Fagus sylvatica) over calcareous soil. Dinaric calcareous block fir forest; European Silver Fir (Abies alba). * Alti- mediterranean (taiga zone, BO= Boreal); , European Beech (Fagus sylvatica), Bosnian Pine (Pinus heldreichii), Greek Maple (Acer heldreichii) at the Tree line. The less humid regions have Juniper (and for example: Iris orjenii, Viola chelmea) over Sesleria robusta grasses. * Cry-omediterranean (tundra zone, AL= Alpine); , Xerophytes. Trifolium, Narcissus, Gentiana nivalis, Draba hoppeanae, Androsace alpina. =Climate= Examples of climate near the Orjen range include eu-mediterranean at the Podgorica Airport: and Crkvice in the supra-mediterranean belt: Note how the mean temperature near sea level is comparable to the high temperature at Crkvice, 940 meters higher. Sierra Nevada of Spain The Sierra Nevada of central Spain is an example of eu- mediterranean zonation arising from moderate aridity. The Sierra Nevada lie in the Iberian conifer forests ecoregion, which contain conifers above elevation, with mixed oak woodland below. The base of the mountains have a continental Mediterranean climate, which gets progressively cooler as the elevation increases: * Thermomediterranean zone (Lowland); under elevation. Summers are hot here and winters almost nonexistent. This zone is mostly used for agriculture, but studies say Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), Common Juniper (Juniperus communis), (Aristolochia baetica) and Mediterranean Smilax or Common Smilax (Smilax aspera) would normally grow here. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Purret (Ulex parviflorus) and Gum Rockrose (Cistus ladanifer) are present on poor soils or after forest fires. * Mesomediterranean zone (Submontane) elevation. The summers are here still hot but frosts are normal in the winters. In this zone Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), wild Olive (Olea europaea) and Mediterranean Smilax or Common Smilax (Smilax aspera) grow. Poor sandy soils have few species with the Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), the Common Junipers, (Juniperus communis), Daphne gnidium and Etruscan honeysuckle (Lonicera etrusca). * Supramediterranean zone (Mid-Montane) elevation. The summers are here temperate and frosts and snow are frequent in winter. Quercus pyrenaica predominates, Portuguese Oak (Quercus faginea) and maple appear too; these three species make up the forest. More frequent are the Sessile Oaks (Quercus petraea) between 1,300 and 1,750 m. The Sessile Oaks are dominated by the Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex) and, depending on soil and altitude, by bushes as Common Juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), barberry (Berberis hispanica), (Daphne gnidium), Butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and Common Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) over basic soils. * Oromediterranean zone (Subalpine) elevation. In this zone, coniferous plants and sparse Juniperus thurifera appear. The vegetation is composed by trees and bushes (Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris), Savin Juniper (Juniperus sabina), Juniperus communis subsp. hemisphaerica, Prunus ramburii) and other bushes (Vella spinosa, Erinacea anthyllis, Bupleurum spinosum). On better soils the Common Juniper, Juniperus communis and Cytisus appears, forming communities with Arenaria imbricata, Festuca indigesta. The endemic flora is present too: Genista versicolor, Arenaria pungens, Potentilla nevadensis. * Cryo-oromediterranean zone (Alpine); elevation. Ligneous plants can not grow here because of the seasonal dryness typical of the Mediterranean climate and the presence of snow for more than 8 months. The vegetation has similarities to the Arctic tundra, with the Mat- grass (Nardus stricta) as the most common species. = Climate = Almer√≠a, near sea level, is an example of a Thermo-mediterranean climate, among the warmest locations on the European continent: Prado Llano, in the Albergue Juvenil of Cordoba has an oromediterranean climate because it is approximately higher:  Corsica  The mountains of Corsica are in the Corsican montane broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion, with a pattern of forest zones that are strongly dependent on altitude (due to the increase in moisture): * Thermomediterranean vegetation belt, (south) and (north); Pistacia lentiscus shrubs and dense mediterranean coastal scrub (maquis) with Quercus ilex, Phillyrea, Myrtus communis and wild olive (Olea europea var. sylvestris).

Though born in Helsinki, his family soon afterwards moved to the city of Lappeenranta, where he spent his childhood. After finishing school in Lappeenranta, he initially studied philosophy at the University of Helsinki before switching to studying architecture at Helsinki University of Technology, graduating in 1985. He completed a PhD in architecture theory, with a thesis titled \\"Constructing Architecture\\", at Tampere University of Technology in 1992. Kari Jormakka's main theoretical position is characterized by studies in the ontology of architecture, defining the constructed nature of buildings as works of interpretation. As such a work may then be significantly determined by the period when it was created, a position that Jormakka critiqued through theories of Zeitgeist primarily associated with Friedrich Hegel and, in regard to modernist works, Arthur C. Danto. In \\"Eyes that do not see\\" (2011), the last published work during his lifetime, Jormakka applied these ideas to the theory of Functionalism best associated with the thinking of architect Le Corbusier and his fellow functionalists. At the time of his death Jormakka was Professor of Architecture Theory at Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria. Previously he taught at the Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Ohio State University, and was a visiting professor at Harvard University.

The campaigns in which he was involved include the Saint-Domingue expedition. He was made a grand officer of the L√©gion d'honneur on 2 June 1809 and a knight of the Order of the Iron Crown, as well as a Comte de l'Empire in 1808. His name is engraved on the 16th column of the east side of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Life=To 1801= Boudet began his military career as a sous-lieutenant in the l√©gion de Maillebois, before becoming a dragoon in the r√©giment de Penthi√®vre in 1785. Later, on the formation of the National Guards, he entered a battalion of volunteers in Gironde as a lieutenant in 1792. In 1793 he gained distinction for his bravery at the 1793 fighting at Ch√¢teau-Pignon and assisted at the Siege of Toulon as a captain, then in 1794 he fought in the War in the Vend√©e. He set off from √Æle de R√© for Guadeloupe (then occupied by the British) with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, beside Victor Hugues, on 21 April 1794. He was landed at Pointe des Salines and captured fort Fleur d'√©p√©e and the town of Pointe-√†-Pitre, strongly defended by the British. He was made chef de brigade on 18 June 1794 and then g√©n√©ral de brigade and supreme commander of all land forces on Guadeloupe on 14 December 1795. On 28 December 1794, at Pointe-√†-Pitre, he married Marie Joseph Elisabeth Augustine Darboussier. He completed the conquest of the island by a long series of brilliant feats of arms and the French Directory (via Victor Hugues and Lebas) raised him to the rank of g√©n√©ral de division. Boudet headed some dragoons to punish the rebellion of Le Lamentin in December 1797 and then, after two years and having made the island defensible, he returned to France in April 1799 to take part in the Dutch campaign, under the command of general Brune. After 18 brumaire, he joined the arm√©e de r√©serve, commanded by Berthier and being readied for Italy. He led the vanguard in the second Italian campaign of Napol√©on Bonaparte and gained distinction at the head of his division, especially at Lodi and Marengo, being wounded at the latter. =Saint- Domingue= Just as peace accords were being signed with the British at London (1 October 1801) he was chosen the expedition being prepared for Saint- Domingue due to his colonial experience (as were other leaders of this expedition, such as Edme √âtienne Borne Desfourneaux and Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Rochambeau). On 8 October he was put in command of the troops gathered at Rochefort, which would form the core of his division on Saint-Domingue. Leaving Brest on 11 December 1801 and landing at Port-au-Prince on 5 February 1802, he treated its black, white and creole inhabitants equally and was thus made very welcome. Operating in isolation from the rest of his supreme commander Charles Leclerc's troops, Boudet easily captured Leogane (11 February) then followed Dessalines's bloody trail as far as Saint-Marc (25 February), then to the redoubt at Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot. He assaulted the redoubt on 11 March, being wounded in the heel by shrapnel and forced to abandon his command of the division to Rochambeau. The Haitian historian A. Beaubrun- Arnouin (slightly suspected of pro-French bias) writes that Boudet was almost unique in his humanity towards enemy soldiers or prisoners, gaining respect even from his enemies. During this time Magloire P√©lage's provisional government on Guadeloupe, wishing to prove its loyalty to the government of mainland France, demanded that Leclerc send him Boudet to take command of the island until Paris officially sent it a new governor. He was still highly appreciated by Guadeloupe's inhabitants since his previous time on the island and thus left Saint-Domingue for Guadeloupe on 21 April 1802, but unfortunately general Antoine Richepanse's expedition reached the island before him (6 May) and Richepanse's brutal command immediately ignited a revolt there by Louis Delgr√®s and his companions. Boudet reached the island on 28 May but his presence there rapidly became useless and he returned to Saint- Domingue, where he was put at the head of the division in the north in September before being sent back to France by Leclerc on 28 September to inform Bonaparte of the dramatic situation. This was a trusted mission given to an officer whose merit he praised, though in correspondence Leclerc later accused him of embezzlement during his time on Saint-Domingue. =Europe= General Boudet was welcomed back to France as a hero and made commander of the 1st Infantry Division in the corps of general Claude-Victor Perrin (26 October 1803) in the northern Netherlands. He then moved to the corps under general Auguste Fr√©d√©ric Louis Viesse de Marmont, at the Utrecht camp (5 February 1804). He took part in the 1805 campaign under Marmont before being sent to the arm√©e d‚ÄôItalie in 1806. In 1807 he was in Germany and took part in the siege of Colbert under the command of Murat and, after the Treaties of Tilsit, captured Stralsund. In return for Boudet's services, Napol√©on made him a comte d'Empire in 1808 and gave him land with a revenue of 30,000 francs in Swedish Pomerania. He took up garrison duties in the Hanseatic towns and was in the front rank during the Austrian campaign of 1809 at the head of the 4th Division of the 4th Army Corps commanded by marshal Andr√© Mass√©na. General Boudet assisted in the capture of Vienna then distinguished himself in the fierce defence of the village of Essling (21‚Äì22 May 1809), turning a granary into an impregnable bunker. As Napoleon himself admitted, it was to general Boudet's conduct that the French owed their victory at Aspern. He lost his artillery at Wagram on 6 July, however, leading to fierce public criticism of Napoleon. He died on 14 September, shortly after a humiliating interview with Napoleon earlier that day, either by suicide or dying of despair.

Kepler wrote the book following the appearance of the supernova SN 1604, also known as Kepler's Supernova. This star appeared in the constellation Ophiuchus, the Greek (·ΩàœÜŒπŒø·ø¶œáŒøœÇ Ophioukhos) \\"serpent-bearer\\" which is also known in Latin as Serpentarius . The SN 1604 supernova was observable for almost a year, from October 1604 to October 1605. Observation conditions were good, particularly when it was first visible. A conjunction of Jupiter and Mars happened to be taking place near the place where the supernova appeared, meaning that astronomers happened to be looking in its direction. As a result there were many witnesses to its appearance, but Kepler's observations were particularly meticulous. The care he took not only to record his own observations but to compile the observations of other astronomers make De Stella Nova a very important record both of the supernova itself, and of the astronomy of the early 17th century.  Position  As soon as the ‚Äònew star‚Äô appeared, Kepler began recording his observations, measuring its angular distance from known stars such as œÉ Sagittarii, Œ∑ Ophiuchi, Œ± Ophiuchi, Œ∂ Ophiuchi, Œ± Aquilae and Œ± Scorpii. With a typical error of less than one minute of arc, remarkable for observations made with the naked eye, he established that it had no noticeable movement. The low declination of the supernova over the latitude Kepler was observing from (Prague, around 50¬∞ north) likely caused atmospheric refraction, explaining most of Kepler‚Äôs errors. It is hard to be sure however, since Kepler‚Äôs book gives no indication of the times or atmospheric conditions of his observations. Kepler also mentions the measurements made by David Fabricius in Osteel, which agreed with his own. (They were so precise that in 1943 they allowed Walter Baade to locate the supernova remnant, SNR G4.5+6.8). Kepler‚Äôs measurements allowed him to be certain that the ‚Äònew star‚Äô showed no parallax. Thus, as suggested by the supernova observed 32 years previously by Tycho Brahe (SN 1572), the Aristotelian doctrine that the distant stars were fixed in the firmament must be false.  Light curve  Kepler also mentioned his measures of the object‚Äôs brightness, which compared it with Jupiter, Venus, Mars and several nearby stars. These were sufficiently precise and extended over a year, allowing the supernova‚Äôs light curve to be reconstructed.

Celebrated annually on 26 January, it marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British ships at Port Jackson, New South Wales, and the raising of the Flag of Great Britain at Sydney Cove by Governor Arthur Phillip. In present-day Australia, celebrations reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards and citizenship ceremonies welcoming new members of the Australian community. The meaning and significance of Australia Day has evolved and been contested over time, and not all states have celebrated the same date as their date of historical significance. Unofficially, or historically, the date has also been variously named Anniversary Day, Foundation Day and ANA Day. It is also known as Invasion Day and National Day of Mourning. The date of 26 January 1788 marked the proclamation of British sovereignty over the eastern seaboard of Australia (then known as New Holland). Although it was not known as Australia Day until over a century later, records of celebrations on 26 January date back to 1808, with the first official celebration of the formation of New South Wales held in 1818. On New Year's Day 1901, the British colonies of Australia formed a federation, marking the birth of modern Australia. A national day of unity and celebration was looked for. It was not until 1935 that all Australian states and territories adopted use of the term \\"Australia Day\\" to mark the date, and not until 1994 that the date was consistently marked by a public holiday on that day by all states and territories. In contemporary Australia, the holiday is marked by the presentation of the Australian of the Year Awards on Australia Day Eve, announcement of the Australia Day Honours list and addresses from the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. It is an official public holiday in every state and territory. With community festivals, concerts and citizenship ceremonies, the day is celebrated in large and small communities and cities around the nation. Australia Day has become the biggest annual civic event in Australia.National Australia Day Council Annual Report 2010‚Äì11 p. 3 Some Indigenous Australian events are now included. However, since at least 1938, the date of Australia Day has also been marked by Indigenous Australians, and those sympathetic to the cause, mourning what is seen as the invasion of the land by the British and the start of colonisation, protesting its celebration as a national holiday. These groups sometimes refer to 26 January as Invasion Day, Survival Day, or Day of Mourning to observe it as a counter-celebration and advocate that the date should be changed, or that the holiday should be abolished entirely. History=Arrival of the First Fleet= On 13 May 1787 a fleet of 11 ships, which came to be known as the First Fleet, was sent by the British Admiralty from England to New Holland. Under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, the fleet sought to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay on the coast of New South Wales, which had been explored and claimed by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. The settlement was seen as necessary because of the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America. The Fleet arrived between 18 and 20 January 1788, but it was immediately apparent that Botany Bay was unsuitable. On 21 January, Phillip and a few officers travelled to Port Jackson, to the north, to see if it would be a better location for a settlement. They stayed there until 23 January; Phillip named the site of their landing Sydney Cove, after the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. They also made contact with the local Aboriginal people. They returned to Botany Bay on the evening of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out. On 25 January the gale was still blowing; the fleet tried to leave Botany Bay, but only made it out, carrying Arthur Phillip, Philip Gidley King, some marines and about 40 convicts; they anchored in Sydney Cove in the afternoon. Meanwhile, back at Botany Bay, Captain John Hunter of made contact with the French ships, and he and the commander, Captain de Clonard, exchanged greetings. Clonard advised Hunter that the fleet commander was Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse. Sirius successfully cleared Botany Bay, but the other ships were in great difficulty. was blown dangerously close to rocks; Friendship and became entangled, both ships losing booms or sails; Charlotte and the Friendship actually collided; and nearly ran aground. Despite these difficulties, all the remaining ships finally managed to clear Botany Bay and sail to Sydney Cove on 26 January. The last ship anchored there at about 3 pm.David Hill, 1788: The Brutal Truth of the First Fleet, pp. 147‚Äì150 Capt. Arthur Phillip raising the British flag at Sydney Cove, 26 January 1788. Oil sketch by Algernon Talmage, 1937. Foundation of Australia plaque, Loftus Street, Circular Quay So it was on 26 January that a landing was made at Sydney Cove and clearing of the ground for an encampment immediately began. Then, according to Phillip's account: The formal establishment of the Colony of New South Wales did not however occur on 26 January as is commonly assumed. It did not occur until 7 February 1788, when the formal proclamation of the colony and of Arthur Phillip's governorship were read out. The vesting of all land in the reigning monarch King George III also dates from 7 February 1788. =First fifty years: 1788 to 1838= Although there was no official recognition of the colony's anniversary, with the New South Wales Almanacks of 1806 and 1808 placing no special significance on 26 January, by 1808 the date was being used by the colony's immigrants, especially the emancipated convicts, to \\"celebrate their love of the land they lived in\\" with \\"drinking and merriment\\".Clark, Manning in The 1808 celebrations followed this pattern, beginning at sunset on 25 January and lasting into the night, the chief toast of the occasion being Major George Johnston. Johnston had the honour of being the first officer ashore from the First Fleet, having been carried from the landing boat on the back of convict James Ruse. Despite suffering the ill-effects of a fall from his gig on the way home to Annandale, Johnston led the officers of the New South Wales Corps in arresting Governor William Bligh on the following day, 26 January 1808, in what became known as the \\"Rum Rebellion\\". Almanacs started mentioning \\"First Landing Day\\" or \\"Foundation Day\\" and successful immigrants started holding anniversary dinners. In 1817 The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported on one of these unofficial gatherings at the home of Isaac Nichols: 1818 was the 30th anniversary of the founding of the colony, and Governor Lachlan Macquarie chose to acknowledge the day with the first official celebration. The Governor declared that the day would be a holiday for all government workers, granting each an extra allowance of \\"one pound [c. 450g] of fresh meat\\", and ordered a 30-gun salute at Dawes Point ‚Äì one for each year that the colony had existed. This began a tradition that was retained by the Governors that were to follow. The first in what would become the Sydney Regatta tradition, 26 January 1838. Foundation Day, as it was known at the time, continued to be officially celebrated in New South Wales, and in doing so became connected with sporting events. One of these became a tradition that is still continued today: in 1837 the first running of what would become the Australia Day regatta was held on Sydney Harbour. Five races were held for different classes of boats, from first class sailing vessels to watermen's skiffs, and people viewed the festivities from both onshore and from the decks of boats on the harbour, including the steamboat Australian and the Francis Freelingthe latter running aground during the festivities and having to be refloated the next day. Happy with the success of the regatta, the organisers resolved to make it an annual event. However, some of the celebrations had gained an air of elitism, with the \\"United Australians\\" dinner being limited to those born in Australia. In describing the dinner, the Sydney Herald justified the decision, saying: The following year, 1838, was the 50th anniversary of the founding of the colony, and as part of the celebrations Australia's first public holiday was declared. The regatta was held for a second time, and people crowded the foreshores to view the events, or joined the five steamers (Maitland, Experiment, Australia, Rapid, and the miniature steamer Firefly) to view the proceedings from the water. At midday 50 guns were fired from Dawes' Battery as the Royal Standard was raised, and in the evening rockets and other fireworks lit the sky. The dinner was a smaller affair than the previous year, with only 40 in attendance compared to the 160 from 1837, and the anniversary as a whole was described as a \\"day for everyone\\". =Centenary celebration: 1839 to 1935= NSW state banquet to commemorate \\"the first 100 years of Australian settlement\\", 26 January 1888 Prior to 1888, 26 January was very much a New South Wales affair, as each of the colonies had their own commemorations for their founding. In Tasmania, Regatta Day occurred initially in December to mark the anniversary of the landing of Abel Tasman. South Australia celebrated Proclamation Day on 28 December. Western Australia had their own Foundation Day (now Western Australia Day) on 1 June. In 1888, all colonial capitals except Adelaide celebrated \\"Anniversary Day\\". In 1910, South Australia adopted 26 January as \\"Foundation Day\\", to replace another holiday known as Accession Day, which had been held on 22 January to mark the accession to the throne of King Edward VII, who died in May 1910. The first Australia Day was established in response to Australia's involvement in World War One. In 1915, the mother of four servicemen thought up the idea of a national day, with the specific aim of raising funds for wounded soldiers, and the term was coined to stir up patriotic feelings.} In 1915 a committee to celebrate Australia Day was formed, and the date chosen was 30 July, on which many fund-raising efforts were run to support the war effort. It was also held in July in subsequent years of World War I: on 28 July 1916, 27 July 1917,Adelaide Advertiser, 25 July 1917, Trove and 26 July 1918.Adelaide Advertiser, 27 July 1918, Trove Victoria adopted 26 January as Australia Day in 1931, and by 1935, all states of Australia were celebrating 26 January as Australia Day (although it was still known as Anniversary Day in New South Wales). The name \\"Foundation Day\\" persisted in local usage. =Sesquicentenary= Sesquicentenary parade in Sydney, 26 January 1938 The 150th anniversary of British settlement in Australia in 1938 was widely celebrated. Preparations began in 1936 with the formation of a Celebrations Council. In that year, New South Wales was the only state to abandon the traditional long weekend, and the annual Anniversary Day public holiday was held on the actual anniversary day ‚Äì Wednesday 26 January. The Commonwealth and state governments agreed to unify the celebrations on 26 January as \\"Australia Day\\" in 1946, although the public holiday was instead taken on the Monday closest to the actual anniversary. =Bicentennial year= Sydney Harbour, 26 January 1988 In 1988, the celebration of 200 years since the arrival of the First Fleet was organised on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities. Over 2.5 million people attended the event in Sydney. These included street parties, concerts, including performances on the steps and forecourt of the Sydney Opera House and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, and the opening of the Powerhouse Museum at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.  Contemporary celebrations  Since 1988, participation in Australia Day has increased, and in 1994 all states and territories began to celebrate a unified public holiday on the actual day for the first time. Previously, some states had celebrated the public holiday on a Monday or Friday to ensure a long weekend. Research conducted in 2007 reported that 28% of Australians polled attended an organised Australia Day event and a further 26% celebrated with family and friends. This reflected the results of an earlier research project where 66% of respondents anticipated that they would actively celebrate Australia Day 2005.Elliott and Shanahan Research (2004). Newspoll Omnibus Survey Australia Day 2005 500,000 people watch the City of Perth Skyworks at Applecross, Western Australia on Australia Day, 2006 Outdoor concerts, community barbecues, sports competitions, festivals and fireworks are some of the many events held in communities across Australia. These official events are presented by the National Australia Day Council, an official council or committee in each state and territory, and local committees. In Sydney, the harbour is a focus and boat races are held, such as a ferry race and the tall ships race. In Adelaide, the key celebrations are \\"Australia Day in the City\\" which is a parade, concert and fireworks display held in Elder Park, with a new outdoor art installation in 2019 designed to acknowledge, remember and recognise Aboriginal people who have contributed to the community.

National Days: Constructing and Mobilising National Identity, Palgrave Macmillan, Hampshire, p. 79 The Perth Skyworks is the largest single event presented each Australia Day. The Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship Secretary, Andrew Metcalfe, hand out citizenship certificates to new Australian citizens (2011) Citizenship ceremonies are also commonly held, with Australia Day now the largest occasion for the acquisition of Australian citizenship. On 26 January 2011, more than 300 citizenship ceremonies took place and around 13,000 people from 143 countries took Australian citizenship.Department of Immigration and Citizenship (2011) Annual Report 2010‚Äì2011, p. 247 In recent years many citizenship ceremonies have included an affirmation by existing citizens. Research conducted in 2007 reported that 78.6% of respondents thought that citizenship ceremonies were an important feature of the day. The official Australia Day Ambassador Program supports celebrations in communities across the nation by facilitating the participation of high-achieving Australians in local community celebrations. In 2011, 385 ambassadors participated in 384 local community celebrations.National Australia Day Council Annual Report 2010‚Äì11 p. 7 The Order of Australia awards are also a feature of the day. The Australia Day Achievement Medallion is awarded to citizens by local governments based on excellence in both government and non-government organisations. The Governor- General and Prime Minister both address the nation. On the eve of Australia Day each year, the Prime Minister announces the winner of the Australian of the Year award, presented to an Australian citizen who has shown a \\"significant contribution to the Australian community and nation\\" and is an \\"inspirational role model for the Australian community\\". Subcategories of the award include Young Australian of the Year and Senior Australian of the Year, and an award for Australia's Local Hero. Awards announcement on Australia Day Eve, 25 January 2005 Australia Day barbecue at Berridge Park, Denmark, Western Australia Research in 2009 indicated that Australians reflect on history and future fairly equally on Australia Day. Of those polled, 43% agreed that history is the most important thing to think about on Australia Day and 41% said they look towards \\"our future\\", while 13% thought it was important to \\"think about the present at this time\\" and 3% were unsure.Newspoll research conducted in November 2009 for the National Australia Day Council Despite the date reflecting the arrival of the First Fleet, contemporary celebrations are not particularly historical in their theme. There are no large-scale re- enactments and the national leader's participation is focused largely on events such as the Australian of the Year Awards announcement and Citizenship Ceremonies.National Australia Day Council, Annual Report 2008‚Äì2009, p. 8 Possibly reflecting a shift in Australians' understanding of the place of Indigenous Australians in their national identity, Newspoll research in November 2009 reported that ninety percent of Australians polled believed \\"it was important to recognise Australia's indigenous people and culture\\" as part of Australia Day celebrations. A similar proportion (89%) agreed that \\"it is important to recognise the cultural diversity of the nation\\".Newspoll Omnibus Survey.pdf Despite the strong attendance at Australia Day events and a positive disposition towards the recognition of Indigenous Australians, the date of the celebrations remains a source of challenge and national discussion. Change the date movement An Invasion Day rally in Brisbane, 2007 Some Australians regard Australia Day as a symbol of the adverse impacts of British settlement on Australia's Indigenous peoples. In 1888, prior to the first centennial anniversary of the First Fleet landing on 26 January 1788, New South Wales premier Henry Parkes was asked about inclusion of Aboriginal people in the celebrations. He replied: \\"And remind them that we have robbed them?\\" The celebrations in 1938 were accompanied by an Aboriginal Day of Mourning. A large gathering of Aboriginal people in Sydney in 1988 led an \\"Invasion Day\\" commemoration marking the loss of Indigenous culture. Some Indigenous figures and others continue to label Australia Day as \\"Invasion Day\\", and protests occur almost every year, sometimes at Australia Day events. Thousands of people participate in protest marches in capital cities on Invasion Day/Australia Day; estimates for the 2018 protest in Melbourne range into tens of thousands. The anniversary is also termed by some as \\"Survival Day\\" and marked by events such as the Survival Day concert, first held in Sydney in 1992, celebrating the fact that the Indigenous people and culture have survived despite colonisation and discrimination. In 2016, National Indigenous Television chose the name \\"Survival Day\\" as its preferred choice on the basis that it acknowledges the mixed nature of the day, saying that the term \\"recognises the invasion\\", but does not allow that to frame the entire story of the Aboriginal people. In response, official celebrations have tried to include Indigenous people, holding ceremonies such as the Woggan-ma-gule ceremony, held in Sydney, which honours the past and celebrates the present. In August 2017 the council of the City of Yarra, a district of Melbourne, resolved unanimously that it would no longer refer to 26 January as Australia Day and would cease to hold citizenship ceremonies on that day; an event acknowledging Aboriginal culture and history was to be held instead. The City of Darebin later followed suit. The federal government immediately deprived the councils of their powers to hold citizenship ceremonies. Byron Shire Council became the third council to have its power to have citizenship ceremonies stripped. On 13 January 2019, prime minister Scott Morrison announced that, with effect from Australia Day 2020, all local councils would be required to hold citizenship ceremonies on and only on 26 January and 17 September; there would also be a dress code, banning thongs and board shorts. Crowds estimated as high as 80,000 turned out in an \\"Invasion Day\\" protest in Melbourne alone in 2019, and rallies were held across the country. On 12 November 2019, following an online survey, the Inner West Council became the first local authority in Sydney to end Australia Day celebrations, encouraging residents instead to attend the Aboriginal Yabun festival held on that day. The council will still hold a citizenship ceremony on that day. =Suggested changes to the date= Invasion Day rally, Melbourne 2019 Both before the establishment of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and in the years after its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls during school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act. Amongst those calling for change have been Tony Beddison, then chairman of the Australia Day Committee (Victoria), who argued for change and requested debate on the issue in 1999; and Mick Dodson, Australian of the Year in 2009, who called for debate as to when Australia Day was held. Such a move would have to be made by a combination of the Australian Federal and State Governments, and has lacked sufficient political and public support. In 2001 Prime Minister John Howard stated that he acknowledged Aboriginal concerns with the date, but that it was nevertheless a significant day in Australia's history, and thus he was in favour of retaining the current date. He also noted that 1 January, which was being discussed in light of the Centenary of Federation, was inappropriate as it coincided with New Year's Day. In 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave a \\"straightforward no\\" to a change of date, speaking in response to Mick Dodson's suggestion to reopen the debate. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, echoed Rudd's support of 26 January, but, along with Rudd, supported the right of Australians to raise the issue. At the State level, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees stated that he was yet to hear a \\"compelling argument\\" to support change; and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh expressed her opposition to a change. In June 2017 the annual National General Assembly of the Australian Local Government Association voted (by a majority of 64‚Äì62) for councils to consider how to lobby the federal government for a date change.  Polling  In 2004, a Newspoll poll that asked if the date of Australia Day should be moved to one that is not associated with European settlement found 79% of respondents favoured no change, 15% favoured change, and 6% were uncommitted. Historian Geoffrey Blainey said in 2012 that he believed 26 January worked well as Australia Day and that it was at that time more successful than it had ever been. A January 2017 poll conducted by McNair yellowSquare for Guardian found that 68% of Australians felt positive about Australia Day, 19% were indifferent and 7% had mixed feelings, with 6% feeling negative about Australia Day. Among Indigenous Australians, however, only 23% felt positive about Australia Day, 31% were negative and 30% had mixed feelings, with 54% favouring a change of date. A September 2017 poll conducted by Essential Polling for The Guardian found that 54% were opposed to changing the date; 26% of Australians supported changing the date and 19% had no opinion. Federation Pavilion, Centennial Park, Sydney, 1 January 1901 A poll conducted by progressive public policy think tank The Australia Institute in 2018 found that 56% do not mind what day it is held. The same poll found that 49% believe that the date should not be on a date that is offensive to Indigenous Australians, but only 37% believed the current date was offensive. Prior to Australia day 2019, the conservative public policy think tank Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) released a poll that 75% of Australians wanted the date to stay, and the new right wing group Advance Australia's poll had support at 71%, although both groups asked questions about pride in being Australian prior to the headline question.  Suggested alternative dates  ;Federation of Australia (1 January): As early as 1957, 1 January was suggested as a possible alternative day, to commemorate the Federation of Australia. In 1902, the year after Federation, 1 January was named \\"Commonwealth Day\\". However, New Year's Day was already a public holiday, and Commonwealth Day did not gather much support. ;Federation of Australia 1901 alternative date (19 January): Proposed as an alternative because it is only one week earlier than Australia Day and can represent the year of Federation 19.01. ;Anzac Day (25 April): There has been a degree of support by some in recent years for making Anzac Day, 25 April, Australia's national day, including in 1999, by Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Peter Hollingworth. In 2001, following comments made during a review into the future of Anzac Day, the idea of a merger was strongly opposed by Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, who clarified his earlier position. ;Mate (8 May): Starting 2017, there has been a partly serious suggestion to move Australia day to 8 May. This is primarily because of the homophonous quality between and the Australian idiom \\"mate\\", but also because the opening of the first Federal Parliament was on 9 May. ;Opening of the first Federal Parliament (9 May): The date 9 May is also sometimes suggested, the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in Melbourne in 1901, the date of the opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, and the date of the opening of the New Parliament House in 1988. The date has, at various times, found support from former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Tony Beddison, and Geoffrey Blainey. However, the date has been seen by some as being too closely connected with Victoria, and its location close to the start of winter has been described as an impediment. ;Anniversary of the 1967 referendum (27 May): The anniversary of the 1967 referendum to amend the federal constitution has also been suggested. The amendments enabled the federal parliament to legislate with regard to Indigenous Australians and allowed for Indigenous Australians to be included in the national census. The public vote in favour was 91%. ;Wattle Day (1 September): Wattle Day is the first day of spring in the southern hemisphere. Australia's green and gold comes from the wattle, and it has symbolised Australia since the early 1800s. Wattle Day has been proposed as the new date for Australia Day since the 1990s and is supported by the National Wattle Day Association. ;Tenterfield Oration (24 October): \\"A more meaningful day is October 24, when in 1889 Sir Henry Parkes, the 'Father of Federation', gave his pivotal speech at Tenterfield in NSW, which set the course for federation.\\" ;Eureka Stockade (3 December): The Eureka Stockade on 3 December has had a long history as an alternative choice for Australia Day, having been proposed by The Bulletin in the 1880s. The Eureka uprising occurred in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush, and saw a failed rebellion by the miners against the Victorian colonial government. Although the rebellion was crushed, it led to significant reforms, and has been described as being the birthplace of Australian democracy. Supporters of the date have included senator Don Chipp and former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. However, the idea has been opposed by both hard-left unions and right- wing nationalist groups, both of whom claim symbolic attachment to the event, and by some who see it as an essentially Victorian event.

Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon guns). A large-caliber gun is also referred to as a cannon. The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within the barrel tube, produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns). The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle. Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns). The first devices identified as guns appeared in China from around CE 1000. By the 12th century, the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century. Etymology The origin of the English word gun is considered to derive from the name given to a particular historical weapon. Domina Gunilda was the name given to a remarkably large ballista, a mechanical bolt throwing weapon of enormous size, mounted at Windsor Castle during the 14th century. This name in turn may have derived from the Old Norse woman's proper name Gunnhildr which combines two Norse words referring to battle.Merriam-Webster, Inc. (1990). The Merriam-Webster's New Book of Word Histories. Basic Books. pg.207 In any case the term gonne or gunne was applied to early hand-held firearms by the late 14th or early 15th century. History Hand cannon from the Chinese Yuan Dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) Western European handgun, 1380 Depiction of a musketeer (1608) The first device identified as a gun, a bamboo tube that used gunpowder to fire a spear, appeared in China around AD 1000. The Chinese had previously invented gunpowder in the 9th century. \\"With its ninth century AD origins in China, the knowledge of gunpowder emerged from the search by alchemists for the secrets of life, to filter through the channels of Middle Eastern culture, and take root in Europe with consequences that form the context of the studies in this volume.\\" \\"Without doubt it was in the previous century, around +850, that the early alchemical experiments on the constituents of gunpowder, with its self- contained oxygen, reached their climax in the appearance of the mixture itself.\\" An early type of firearm (or portable gun) is the fire lance, a black-powder‚Äìfilled tube attached to the end of a spear and used as a flamethrower; shrapnel was sometimes placed in the barrel so that it would fly out together with the flames. The earliest depiction of a gunpowder weapon is the illustration of a fire-lance on a mid-10th century silk banner from Dunhuang. The De'an Shoucheng Lu, an account of the siege of De'an in 1132, records that Song forces used fire-lances against the Jurchens. In due course, the proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to maximise its explosive power. To better withstand that explosive power, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal. And to take full advantage of that power, the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely. With this, we have the three basic features of the gun: a barrel made of metal, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the powder charge exerts its full potential in propellant effect. Breech-loading guns called cetbang were used by the Majapahit Empire during the conquest of Nusantara in 1336‚Äì1350. The knowledge of making powder weapons in Java is thought to have originated from the Mongol invasion in 1293.Song Lian. History of Yuan. These swivel guns mounted on various vessels of the Majapahit navy were used to great effect against traditional boarding- style warfare of other kingdoms in the archipelago. One theory of how gunpowder came to Europe is that it made its way along the Silk Road through the Middle East; another is that it was brought to Europe during the Mongol invasion in the first half of the 13th century. English Privy Wardrobe accounts list \\"ribaldis\\", a type of cannon, in the 1340s, and siege guns were used by the English at Calais in 1346.David Nicolle, Cr√©cy 1346: Triumph of the longbow, Osprey Publishing; June 25, 2000; . The earliest surviving firearm in Europe has been found from Otep√§√§, Estonia and it dates to at least 1396. Around the late 14th century in Europe, smaller and portable hand-held cannons were developed, creating in effect the first smooth-bore personal firearm. In the late 15th century the Ottoman empire used firearms as part of its regular infantry. The first successful rapid-fire firearm is the Gatling Gun, invented by Richard Gatling and fielded by the Union forces during the American Civil War in the 1860s. The world's first sub-machine gun (a fully automatic firearm which fires pistol cartridges) able to be maneuvered by a single soldier is the MP 18.1, invented by Theodor Bergmann. It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Stosstruppen (assault groups specialized in trench combat). The first assault rifle was introduced during World War II by the Germans, known as the StG44. It was the first firearm which bridges the gap between long range rifles, machine guns, and short range sub-machine guns. Since the mid-20th century guns that fire beams of energy rather than solid projectiles have been developed, and also guns that can be fired by means other than the use of gunpowder. Operating principle Most guns use compressed gas confined by the barrel to propel the bullet up to high speed, though devices operating in other ways are sometimes called guns. In firearms the high- pressure gas is generated by combustion, usually of gunpowder. This principle is similar to that of internal combustion engines, except that the bullet leaves the barrel, while the piston transfers its motion to other parts and returns down the cylinder. As in an internal combustion engine, the combustion propagates by deflagration rather than by detonation, and the optimal gunpowder, like the optimal motor fuel, is resistant to detonation. This is because much of the energy generated in detonation is in the form of a shock wave, which can propagate from the gas to the solid structure and heat or damage the structure, rather than staying as heat to propel the piston or bullet. The shock wave at such high temperature and pressure is much faster than that of any bullet, and would leave the gun as sound either through the barrel or the bullet itself rather than contributing to the bullet's velocity. Components=Barrel= Rifling of a 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun. Barrel types include rifled‚Äîa series of spiraled grooves or angles within the barrel‚Äîwhen the projectile requires an induced spin to stabilize it, and smoothbore when the projectile is stabilized by other means or rifling is undesired or unnecessary. Typically, interior barrel diameter and the associated projectile size is a means to identify gun variations. Bore diameter is reported in several ways. The more conventional measure is reporting the interior diameter (bore) of the barrel in decimal fractions of the inch or in millimetres. Some guns‚Äîsuch as shotguns‚Äîreport the weapon's gauge (which is the number of shot pellets having the same diameter as the bore produced from one English pound (454g) of lead) or‚Äîas in some British ordnance‚Äîthe weight of the weapon's usual projectile. =Projectile= A gun projectile may be a simple, single-piece item like a bullet, a casing containing a payload like a shotshell or explosive shell, or complex projectile like a sub-caliber projectile and sabot. The propellant may be air, an explosive solid, or an explosive liquid. Some variations like the Gyrojet and certain other types combine the projectile and propellant into a single item. Terminology The term gun may refer to any sort of projectile weapon from large cannons to small firearms including those that are usually hand- held (handgun). The word gun is also commonly used to describe objects which, while they are not themselves weapons, produce an effect or possess a form which is in some way evocative of a handgun or long gun. The use of the term \\"cannon\\" is interchangeable with \\"gun\\" as words borrowed from the French language during the early 15th century, from Old French canon, itself a borrowing from the Italian cannone, a \\"large tube\\" augmentative of Latin canna \\"reed or cane\\". Recent scholarship indicates that the term \\"gun\\" may have its origins in the Norse woman's name \\"Gunnildr\\" (which means \\"War-sword\\"), which was often shortened to \\"Gunna\\". The earliest recorded use of the term \\"gonne\\" was in a Latin document circa 1339. Other names for guns during this era were \\"schioppi\\" (Italian translation-\\"thunderers\\"), and \\"donrebusse\\" (Dutch translation-\\"thunder gun\\") which was incorporated into the English language as \\"blunderbuss\\". Artillerymen were often referred to as \\"gonners\\" and \\"artillers\\" Early guns and the men who used them were often associated with the devil and the gunner's craft was considered a black art, a point reinforced by the smell of sulfur on battlefields created from the firing of guns along with the muzzle blast and accompanying flash. The word cannon is retained in some cases for the actual gun tube but not the weapon system. The title gunner is applied to the member of the team charged with operating, aiming, and firing a gun. Autocannons are automatic guns designed primarily to fire shells and are mounted on a vehicle or other mount. Machine guns are similar, but usually designed to fire simple projectiles. In some calibers and some usages, these two definitions overlap. In contemporary military and naval parlance the term gun has a very specific meaning and refers solely to any large-calibre, direct-fire, high-velocity, flat-trajectory artillery piece employing an explosive-filled hollowed metal shell or solid bolt as its primary projectile. This later usage contrasts with large-calibre, high-angle, low-velocity, indirect-fire weapons such as howitzers, mortars, and grenade launchers which invariantly employ explosive-filled shells. In other military use, the term \\"gun\\" refers primarily to direct fire weapons that capitalize on their muzzle velocity for penetration or range. In modern parlance, these weapons are breech-loaded and built primarily for long range fire with a low or almost flat ballistic arc. A variation is the howitzer or gun-howitzer designed to offer the ability to fire both low or high-angle ballistic arcs. In this use, example guns include naval guns. A less strict application of the word is to identify one artillery weapon system or non-machine gun projectile armament on aircraft. A related military use of the word is in describing gun- type fission weapon. In this instance, the \\"gun\\" is part of a nuclear weapon and contains an explosively propelled sub-critical slug of fissile material within a barrel to be fired into a second sub-critical mass in order to initiate the fission reaction. Potentially confused with this usage are small nuclear devices capable of being fired by artillery or recoilless rifle. In civilian use, the captive bolt pistol is used in agriculture to humanely stun farm animals for slaughter. Shotguns are normally civilian weapons used primarily for hunting. These weapons are typically smooth bored and fire a shell containing small lead or steel balls. Variations use rifled barrels or fire other projectiles including solid lead slugs, a Taser XREP projectile capable of stunning a target, or other payloads. In military versions, these weapons are often used to burst door hinges or locks in addition to antipersonnel uses.

After attending high school, Beck attended the West Virginia University, Bucknell University and Lafayette College. He made his professional debut in the National Football League in 1921 with the Buffalo All-Americans. He played for the All-Americans for 1 year, before leaving the NFL. He later returned to the NFL in 1925 as star with both the Pottsville Maroons and the Frankford Yellow Jackets.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BeckCa20.htm When not playing football, Beck worked as a police officer for the Harrisburg Police Department. High school Beck attended Harrisburg Tech, located on Walnut Street. The school closed after the 1925-26 school year. In 1918 and 1919 Beck helped the Tech Maroons win back-to-back state championships in football. In 1919 Beck and the Maroons won the high school national championship. At halfback Beck score 34 touchdowns, many on long runs. He is still considered one of the greatest running backs ever developed in Pennsylvania. Beck totalled an amazing 445 points in his three years of high school. He scored six touchdowns in each of three games, and five in four more. He returned four kickoffs for touchdowns. In one 1919 game, Beck scored four touchdowns in the first seven minutes. Buffalo All-Americans Professionally he played in the American Professional Football Association, later known as the National Football League, for the Buffalo All-Americans. Pottsville Maroons In 1922, the then-independent Pottsville Maroons attracted the sponsorship of several area businessmen. These men upgraded the club by luring talented pro players such as Benny Boynton, Stan Cofall and Beck to the team. In 1924 Beck helped the Maroons win the 1924 Anthracite League championship. This move placed Carl with his brother, Clarence, on the Maroons team. In 1925 the Maroons entered the NFL. That year Carl played on the Maroons team that won the 1925 NFL Championship, before it was stripped from the team due to a disputed rules violation. Bethlehem Bears In 1926 played for the Bethlehem Bears of the Eastern League of Professional Football. While with the Bears, Beck scored a touchdown in a game against Clifton Heights Black & Orange for a 10-0 Bears win. However, he and several other Bears players were mysteriously absent from the very next game against the Shenandoah Red Jackets. This move was supposedly a walk-out. As a result, manager, Gyp Downey, tried to ban all of the involved players from playing in the league. However, he withdrew his motion the very next week and the players returned to the team. In a game against the Gilberton Catamounts Carl tackled Gilberton's halfback, future- Hall of Famer, Fritz Pollard, in the open field, to preserve a 9-0 win for the Bears. The Bethlehem would finish the season in second place. Beck went on to receive first team All-Eastern League honors in 1926. While he only scored two touchdowns, including one in non-league play, for the Bears, his strong running ability was a key component of the team's success.

The chariot was the first of its kind to be found in Scotland and shows Iron Age Scotland in direct contact with the European Continent. The Newbridge chariot was buried intact, a method consistent with the burial practices of Continental Europe rather than Yorkshire.  Excavation  East wheel The excavation of the Newbridge chariot burial was carried out by a team from Headland Archaeology and conservators from the National Museum of Scotland.Carter, S. and F. Hunter (2003). 'An Iron Age chariot burial from Scotland.' Antiquity 77, pp. 531-535. The excavation revealed that the pit would have been little larger than the chariot. It was dug to the depth of the axle then two smaller pits were cut into its base to receive the wheels. A narrower slot accommodated the chariot pole but broadened at the end for the yoke. From the outset it was clear that the iron tyres and other metal fittings around each wheel were well-preserved and it was decided to lift each wheel in a block of soil, allowing specialist excavation and conservation under laboratory conditions. Unfortunately, the poor preservation conditions meant that all traces of a human body had disappeared but given the strong parallels of inhumations accompanying chariot burials there is no reason to doubt the former presence of a body in the pit. The burial may have been part of a larger prehistoric cemetery and enclosure, which surrounded it. The only other area of Britain where chariot burials have been found is of the Arras culture in East Yorkshire,Stead, I.M. 1979. The Arras Culture. York: Yorkshire Philosophical Society. in which most of the chariots were dismantled before burial. The Newbridge example was buried intact in a similar manner to burials in mainland Europe. Chariot construction techniques indicate links with the building traditions of both Yorkshire and Continental Europe. A 5th century BC date for the Newbridge chariot burial places it within the context of La Tene A, consistent with its similarities to European examples and predating known Yorkshire examples. Apart from the wheels and harness fittings there were few other finds. Some horse gear was recovered near the yoke of the chariot.

Scoring 13 goals in 34 games in a period of 2 seasons, the youngster was soon signed by the Latvian Higher League club FK J≈´rmala in 2004. Playing there for the next 4 seasons, Mala≈°enoks managed to become one of the team's leaders, and in 2008 he was the second top scorer of the championship with 13 goals in 29 matches, just one goal behind the leader Vƒ´ts Rimkus. In 2008 his contract with FK J≈´rmala expired and Skonto Riga were keen on signing him, but the player himself decided to look for a club abroad. In the winter transfer period of 2009 Mala≈°enoks went on trial with the Bulgarian club Cherno More Varna and Scottish side Dundee, but didn't stay with these teams and returned to Latvia. On 11 February he signed a one-year contract with FK Ventspils. Before the start of the season Mala≈°enoks was loaned to Tranzit - another club from the city of Ventspils. He played there until September 2009, when an offer from the Maltese Premier League appeared. He joined Hibernians on trial and signed a contract with them till the end of the season on 25 September 2009. He played 14 matches and scored 4 goals in Malta. In 2010, when his contract with the Maltese side had already ended, Mala≈°enoks returned to Latvia and joined the higher league debutant club FK Jelgava. He was voted the best player of the championship in May. With 11 goals in 23 games Mala≈°enoks was the club's top scorer in the 2010 season. In 2011, he was once again voted as the player of the month - this time July. That season Mala≈°enoks added 6 more goals to his name in 14 matches and received a contract offer from Russia in mid- summer. Despite being injured, he signed a two-year contract with Volgar- Gazprom Astrakhan on 31 August 2011. Because of the injury, he didn't play until the end of the year. In August 2012 Mala≈°enoks re-joined his previous club FK Jelgava. He managed to score only 1 goal in 18 league matches for the club. In March 2013 Mala≈°enoks moved to the Latvian Higher League club FC J≈´rmala. Scoring 4 goals in 11 matches, Mala≈°enoks moved back to Jelgava in July 2013, as the club was in a need of a forward and offered him a contract. In 2014 Mala≈°enoks helped Jelgava win the Latvian Cup and attain bronze medals of the domestic championship for the first time in the club's history.

With Albert \\"Ollie\\" Adelman and wife Edith had three young sons (Lynn, Gary & Craig) in 1948 when Ollie asked Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for the family on his lot at Fox Point. The house should cost about $75,000. Albert was the son of Benjamin Adelman, who founded a large laundry and dry cleaning business in the Milwaukee area. Wright designed a number of projects for the Adelman family, including a laundry plant, three homes for Benjamin, and two for Albert. Of these, only this house and the Benjamin Adelman Residence in Phoenix (1951), were actually built. Wright's first design for the house, with brick walls and tile roof, would have cost $325,000 to build, far beyond Adelman's budget. Eventually Wright scaled down his plans to fit Adelman's budget. The Adelman house brings together the long, low profile of some of Wright's turn-of-the- century Prairie school homes with Wright's Usonian ideals for low-maintenance buildings. It is built of buff-colored concrete block and cypress, neither of which requires paint or plaster. The roof is covered with hand split cedar shakes and has wide overhangs. Wright also designed many of the interior furnishings: shelves, wardrobes, desks and sofas. The long home has three bedrooms on one end, a kitchen and dining room at the other end, and a large living/reception area in the center.

The lot has a deep, wooded ravine at one end. The house sits at the rear of the lot, overlooking the ravine, and faces south/southeast to take maximum advantage of natural light. The house, still occupied by members of the Adelman family, was restored in 2015 by Kubala Washatko Architects.https://www.architectmagazine.com/project-gallery/albert-and-edith- adelman-residence-restorationhttp://tkwa.com/ References * Storrer, William Allin.

It was invented by Joseph Fourier. Method The following exposition assumes that the numbers are broken into two-digit pieces, separated by commas: e.g. 3456 becomes 34,56. In general x,y denotes x*100 + y and x,y,z denotes x*10000 + y*100 + z, etc. Suppose that we wish to divide c by a, to obtain the result b. (So a √ó b = c.) :frac{c}{a}=frac{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5dots}{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5dots}=b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5dots = b Note that a1 may not have a leading zero; it should stand alone as a two- digit number. We can find the successive terms b1, b2, etc., using the following formulae: :b_1=frac{c_1,c_2}{a_1}mbox{ with remainder }r_1 :b_2=frac{r_1,c_3 - b_1times a_2}{a_1}mbox{ with remainder }r_2 :b_3=frac{r_2,c_4 - b_2times a_2 - b_1times a_3}{a_1}mbox{ with remainder }r_3 :b_4=frac{r_3,c_5 - b_3times a_2 - b_2times a_3 - b_1times a_4}{a_1}mbox{ with remainder }r_4 dots Each time we add a term to the numerator until it has as many terms as a. From then on, the number of terms remains constant, so there is no increase in difficulty. Once we have as much precision as we need, we use an estimate to place the decimal point. It will often be the case that one of the b terms will be negative. For example, 93,‚àí12 denotes 9288, while ‚àí16,32 denotes ‚àí1600 + 32 or ‚àí1568. (Note: 45,‚àí16,32 denotes 448432.) Care must be taken with the signs of the remainders also. The general term is :b_i=frac{r_{i-1},c_{i+1} - textstyle sum_{j=2}^i b_{i-j+1}times a_j}{a_1}mbox{ with remainder }r_i =Partial quotients with more than two digits= In cases where one or more of the b terms has more than two digits, the final quotient value b cannot be constructed simply by concatenating the digit pairs. Instead, each term, starting with b_1, should be multiplied by 100, and the next term added (or, if negative, subtracted). This result should be multiplied by 100, and the next term added or subtracted, etc., until all terms are exhausted. In other words, we construct partial sums of the b terms: :B_1 = b_1 :B_i = 100b_{i-1} + b_i The last partial sum is the value for b. Example Find the reciprocal of œÄ ‚âà 3.14159. :frac{1}{pi}=frac{10,00,00dots}{31,41,59dots}=b_1,b_2,b_3dots = b :b_1=frac{10,00}{31}=32mbox{ with remainder }8 :b_2=frac{8,00 - 32times 41}{31}=frac{-512}{31}=-17mbox{ with remainder }15 :b_3=frac{15,00 + 17times 41 - 32times 59}{31}=frac{309}{31}=10mbox{ with remainder }-1.

Early life, family, and education Wells was born in Buchans Junction, Newfoundland, at a time when Newfoundland and Labrador was under formal administration as a 'Commission of Government' from the United Kingdom, since 1933, because of serious financial management issues caused largely by the Great Depression.Hoy, p. 15 The Dominion, which saw a return to greater prosperity during World War II, because of Allied military spending, became the tenth province of Canada in 1949, after a referendum process which ultimately won by a narrow margin. Its citizens then became Canadian citizens. Wells grew up from age seven in the village of Stephenville Crossing, in the western part of Newfoundland. Wells was the second-oldest of nine children of Ralph Wells and Maude (nee Kirby) Wells; his father was a railway express messenger and freight handler. The Wells family was poor, and devoutly religious, with the Anglican parish church located very close to their home; the family assisted the parish priest with church operations.Hoy, 1992, pp. 5-13 Wells completed high school with grade 11 in 1952 at age 15, and then worked as a record-keeper for a construction company operating at the United States Air Force's nearby Harmon Base, as well as a plumber's assistant, for three years, to earn money for university; his earnings also helped to support his family.Hoy, pp. 13-17 =Memorial University= Wells graduated from Memorial University of Newfoundland with a BA in Political Science in 1959, with a B average. He was mentored at Memorial by political science professor Mose Morgan, who was also a key university administrator. Morgan strongly influenced Wells with his own federal administrative governance theories.Hoy, pp. 27-29 With his father's sudden death in 1959, Wells helped to support his family when possible by working in Stephenville Crossing. Wells was very active in extra-curricular activities at Memorial. He played ice hockey as a goaltender with the Memorial varsity team, was a co- founder of the university's student Liberal Club, served one term in student government, and assisted with the yearbook's production.Hoy, pp. 30-32 =Dalhousie Law School= Wells graduated on schedule from the three-year law program at Dalhousie Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia with a LL.B in 1962. He ranked in the middle of his class at Dalhousie Law, where future Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney was a classmate for one year before failing.Hoy, 1992, pp.34-42 Early legal career Wells had served in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve, with the Reserve Officer Training Corps, throughout his post- secondary years, including having his third year of law studies financially supported in full. Following law school graduation, he articled in Halifax, and was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia. Wells was then required to serve as a lawyer with the Forces for three years following graduation; he did this with the Judge Advocate General's Office in Ottawa, but bought his way out after two years. He then began private legal practice in Corner Brook in summer 1964, joining the established firm of Kevin Barry.Hoy, 1992, pp. 43-45 Marriage, family Wells married Eleanor Bishop, whom he had known since childhood, on August 20, 1962, in Stephenville Crossing, shortly after law school graduation. Bishop grew up as the daughter of the village's leading business family, and herself graduated from the nursing program at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Halifax.Hoy, p. 31 and p. 40 The couple has three children: Mark, Heidi, and David.Hoy, 1992, p. 43 Entry into Newfoundland politics: elected, chosen for Cabinet Wells entered the Cabinet of Premier Joey Smallwood in August 1966, and was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly for the district of Humber East in the 1966 general election, as a member of the Liberal Party. Wells and John Crosbie resigned from Cabinet on May 14, 1968 over concerns with Premier Smallwood's handling of financing for the Come By Chance Refinery project, which subsequently failed. Resumes legal career Wells left politics in 1971, and resumed his legal practice full-time, gradually developing his career and becoming one of the province's most successful lawyers. With most of his clients based in the St. John's region, Wells transferred his practice to the provincial capital in 1979.Hoy, 1992 CBA Committee on the Constitution While in private practice, Wells was a member of the Canadian Bar Association. In 1977, in the aftermath of the election of the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois government in 1976, Wells was asked to sit on the CBA Committee on the Constitution. The mandate of the Committee was to study and make recommendations on the Constitution of Canada.CBA Resolution 77-01-A: Constitution of Canada - Special Committee; reproduced in Canadian Bar Association: Towards a new Canada - Committee on the Constitution, p. xv. The members of the Committee were drawn from each province of Canada, and included two future provincial premiers (Wells and Joe Ghiz), a future Supreme Court of Canada justice, two future provincial chief justices, and a future Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations. The Committee presented its report to the CBA at the next annual meeting, in 1978. The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations for constitutional change, including a completely new constitution, abolishing the monarchy, changing the Senate, entrenching language rights and a bill of rights, and changing the balance of powers between the federal government and the provinces. Return to provincial politics, becomes premier In 1987, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Leo Barry. Graham Flight, the party's incumbent MHA in Windsor-Buchans, resigned to allow him to contest the seat in a by-election.Newfoundland and Labrador Votes 2007: Grand Falls- Windsor/Green Bay South. cbc.ca. In the 1989 general election, Wells led the party to power, defeating Tom Rideout and ending 17 years of Progressive Conservative rule. In that election, the Progressive Conservatives won a slightly higher percentage of the popular vote (one percentage point). Nonetheless, the Liberals won 31 of the 52 seats in the provincial legislature and formed a majority government. Wells ran in his home riding of Humber East instead of Windsor-Buchans, but was defeated by Lynn Verge, despite having led his party to victory. Subsequently, another member of his caucus, Eddie Joyce, resigned and Wells was acclaimed as the new member for the electoral district of Bay of Islands.Newfoundland and Labrador Votes 2007: Bay of Islands. cbc.ca. Wells became a major figure on the national political stage at the time of the Meech Lake Accord for his opposition to several of its provisions. Wells cancelled the scheduled vote on the agreement in the Newfoundland Legislative Assembly after the Accord failed in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly, where native MLA Elijah Harper prevented the Assembly from ratifying the Accord, on the grounds that the Accord was devised without proper aboriginal input. The Accord would have required ratification by all ten provincial legislatures and parliament to come into effect. (Wells also noted that, in addition to the failure in Manitoba, the Accord was headed for a likely defeat in the Newfoundland House of Assembly.) Wells later participated in discussions that led to the development of a set of constitutional proposals known as the Charlottetown Accord. The Wells administration reformed the province's educational system, implemented far-reaching economic reforms, concluded an agreement to develop the province's first offshore oil field, and coped with the consequences of the collapse of cod stocks off the coast of the province, due to foreign over-fishing, all at the time of a severe economic recession. Retirement from politics Wells retired as Premier in January 1996 and returned to private legal practice. In 1998, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (Court of Appeal) and was appointed Chief Justice in 1999. He retired from that post in March 2009. On November 8, 2012 Wells formally retired as a justice of the court. ReferencesSee also * \\"Clyde Wells: A Political Biography\\", by Claire Hoy, 1992, Stoddart Publishers, Toronto, .

Ten years later she made her New York debut in 1827. Her acting career lasted for 72 years and in her later life she was commonly called \\"the oldest living actress\\". The British stage Clara Fisher was born in London England, on July 14, 1811. Her father was Frederick George Fisher, a librarian and well- known amateur actor. Her earliest memories were of attending concerts and plays with her family. At age five her father enrolled her in acting lessons. Her first performance was on December 10, 1817 at the Drury Lane Theatre as Lord Flimnap in the production of David Garrick's Lilliput, where she \\"astonished the audience with her great talent\\". After her success at Drury Lane, Clara moved on to successful engagements at Covent Garden. By her teens she had successfully performed Richard III, Shylock, Douglas, and Dr. Pangloss. She was hailed as Britain's \\"child wonder\\" and was regarded as the most successful child actor of her time. She performed on the provincial theatre circuits, including the Stamford Circuit theatres at Newark and Grantham in December 1825. The American stage Portrait of Clara Fisher In 1827, at the age of sixteen, Clara Fisher, along with her family, emigrated to the United States. She made her debut on the American stage at the Park Theatre to rave reviews. She was the \\"favorite Star\\" of every city where she performed. She \\"electrified\\" audiences with her portrayals of Ophelia, Viola, Cherubino and Susanna. She sparked a \\"Clara Fisher craze\\". Poems were written about her and her name was given to babies, hotels, stagecoaches, race horses, steamboats and almost anything else Americans could think of. Her plays were attended by the social and political elite of the time. In December 1834, Fisher married James Gaspard Maeder (1809-1876), a composer and vocal coach who wrote an opera for her entitled Peri, or the Enchanted Fountain. Together, they opened a theater in New Orleans and had seven children. Fisher performed with most of the great actors of the time like William Charles Macready, Edmund Kean, Edwin Booth (brother of John Wilkes Booth), John Brougham, Joseph Jefferson, Laura Keene and Edwin Forrest. Due to her immense popularity and success she was able to earn a large fortune that allowed her to retire in 1844. Bad investments and extravagant tastes forced her to resume acting six years later. Later years The actress in her later years Clara Fisher continued to act from 1850 to 1888. Though her popularity declined and she was forced to play the roles of older women, she was still given respect for the strength of her dramatic work and was often referred to as \\"the oldest living actress\\". After her second retirement she wrote her autobiography which she finished in 1897. Clara Fisher died on November 12, 1898 at the home of her daughter in Metuchen, New Jersey. She is buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in New York.

In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. Sedgemoor is a low-lying area of land close to sea level between the Quantock and Mendip hills, historically largely marsh (or moor). It contains the bulk of the area also known as the Somerset Levels, including Europe's oldest known engineered roadway, the Sweet Track. There are 53 Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor, 14 of which are in Castle Street, Bridgwater. In 1723‚Äì1728, Castle Street was built on the site of the demolished Bridgwater Castle, as homes for the merchants trading in the town's port. Outside the town of Bridgwater, the largest concentration of Grade I listed buildings are in the village of Cannington, where the 12th-century Cannington Court and 14th-century Church of St Mary were both associated with a Benedictine nunnery. Cannington is also the site of the 13th-century Gurney Manor and Blackmoor Farmhouse, which was built around 1480 with its own chapel. Most of the Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor are Norman- or medieval-era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. Many of the more recent structures in the list are manor houses such as Halswell House, where the south range was built in the 16th century for Sir Nicholas Halswell and the main north range in 1689 for Sir Halswell Tynte. The most recently constructed building in the list is the Corn Exchange in Bridgwater, built in 1834.

However, the 1794 decree was only implemented in Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and Guyane, and was a dead letter in Senegal, Mauritius, Reunion and Martinique, the last of which had been conquered by the British, who maintained the institution of slavery on that Caribbean island.Sue Peabody, French Emancipation https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199730414/obo-9780199730414-0253.xml Accessed 27 October 2019. R√©union hindered its implementation. Martinique refused to ratify it due to a royalist insurrection there, similar to that in the Vend√©e, which had been in revolt since 16 September 1793 and had, represented by planter Louis-Fran√ßois Dubuc, signed the Whitehall accord of submission to Britain. On 6 February 1794 the British began their military conquest of Martinique, completed on 21 March 1794, and thus the island avoided the abolition of slavery. The Law of 20 May 1802 had the express purpose of restoring slavery in Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and French Guiana, and was passed when Napoleon turned his attention to the French colonies in the peace that followed the 1802 Treaty of Amiens, which also restored Martinique to France.

It is a significant means of exporting energy from the light-rich photic zone to the aphotic zone below which is referred to as the biological pump. Export production is the amount of organic matter produced in the ocean by primary production that is not recycled (remineralised) before it sinks into the aphotic zone. Because of the role of export production in the ocean's biological pump, it is typically measured in units of carbon (e.g. mg C m‚àí2 d‚àí1).The term was first coined by the explorer William Beebe as he observed it from his bathysphere. As the origin of marine snow lies in activities within the productive photic zone, the prevalence of marine snow changes with seasonal fluctuations in photosynthetic activity and ocean currents. Marine snow can be an important food source for organisms living in the aphotic zone, particularly for organisms which live very deep in the water column. Composition Marine snow is made up of a variety of mostly organic matter, including dead or dying animals and phytoplankton, protists, fecal matter, sand, and other inorganic dust. Most trapped particles are more vulnerable to grazers than they would be as free floating individuals. Aggregates can form through abiotic processes i.e. ballasting and biotic processes i.e. extrapolymeric substances(EPS). These are natural polymers exuded as waste products mostly by phytoplankton and bacteria. Mucus secreted by zooplankton (mostly salps, appendicularians, and pteropods) also contribute to the constituents of marine snow aggregates. These aggregates grow over time and may reach several centimeters in diameter, traveling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. Marine snow often forms during algal blooms. As phytoplankton accumulate, they aggregate or get captured in other aggregates, both of which accelerate the sinking rate. Aggregation and sinking is actually thought to be a large component of sources for algae loss from surface water. Most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. The small percentage of material not consumed in shallower waters becomes incorporated into the muddy \\"ooze\\" blanketing the ocean floor, where it is further decomposed through biological activity. Marine snow aggregates exhibit characteristics that fit Goldman's \\"aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis\\". This hypothesis states that phytoplankton, microorganisms and bacteria live attached to aggregate surfaces and are involved in rapid nutrient recycling. Phytoplankton have been shown to be able to take up nutrients from small local concentrations of organic material (e.g. fecal matter from an individual zooplankton cell, regenerated nutrients from organic decomposition by bacteria). As the aggregates slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean, the many microorganisms residing on them are constantly respiring and contribute greatly to the microbial loop. Aggregate dynamics Aggregates begin as the colloidal fraction, which typically contains particles sized between 1 nm and several micrometers. The colloidal fraction of the ocean contains a large amount of organic matter unavailable to grazers. This fraction has a much higher total mass than either phytoplankton or bacteria but is not readily available due to size characteristics of the particles in relation to potential consumers. The colloidal fraction must aggregate in order to be more bioavailable. = Ballasting effect = Aggregates that sink more quickly to the bottom of the ocean have a greater chance of exporting carbon to the deep sea floor. The longer the residence time in the water column the greater the chance of being grazed upon. Aggregates formed in high dust areas are able to increase their densities compared to aggregates formed without dust present and these aggregates with increased lithogenic material have also been correlated with POC fluxes. Aggregates that are able to increase their ballast effect can only do so in the surface ocean as minerals have not been observed to accumulate as they move down the water column. = Fragmentation = :Once particles have aggregated to several micrometers in diameter, they begin to accumulate bacteria, since there is sufficient site space for feeding and reproduction. At this size it is large enough to undergo sinking. It also has the components necessary to fit the \\"aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis\\". Evidence for this has been found by Alldredge and Cohen (1987) who found evidence of both respiration and photosynthesis within aggregates, suggesting the presence of both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms. During zooplankton's vertical migration the abundances of aggregates increased while size distributions decreased. Aggregates were found in the abdomen in zooplankton indicating their grazing will fragment larger aggregates. ;Surface coagulation :Aggregates may also form from colloids trapped on the surface of rising bubbles. For example, Kepkay et al. found that bubble coagulation leads to an increase in bacterial respiration since more food is available to them. ;Filtration :Particles and small organisms floating through the water column can become trapped within aggregates. Marine snow aggregates are porous, however, and some particles are able to pass through them.  Particle associated microorganisms  Planktonic prokaryotes are further defined into two categories, free-living or particle associated. The two are separated by filtration. Particle-associated bacteria are often difficult to study, because marine snow aggregates are often ranging in sizes from 0.2 to 200 Œºm, sampling efforts are often difficult. These aggregates are hotspots for microbial activity. Marine bacteria are the most abundant organisms in aggregates followed by cyanobacteria and then nanoflagellates. Aggregates can be enriched about one thousand times more than the surrounding seawater. Seasonal variability can also have an effect on microbial communities of marine snow aggregates with concentrations being the highest during the summer. As illustrated in the diagram, phytoplankton fix carbon dioxide in the euphotic zone using solar energy and produce particulate organic carbon (POC). POC formed in the euphotic zone is processed by marine microorganisms (microbes), zooplankton and their consumers into organic aggregates (marine snow), which is then exported to the mesopelagic (200‚Äì1000 m depth) and bathypelagic zones by sinking and vertical migration by zooplankton and fish.Basu, S. and Mackey, K.R.

Export flux is defined as the sedimentation out of the surface layer (at approximately 100 m depth) and sequestration flux is the sedimentation out of the mesopelagic zone (at approximately 1000 m depth). A portion of the POC is respired back to CO2 in the oceanic water column at depth, mostly by heterotrophic microbes and zooplankton, thus maintaining a vertical gradient in concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This deep-ocean DIC returns to the atmosphere on millennial timescales through thermohaline circulation. Between 1% and 40% of the primary production is exported out of the euphotic zone, which attenuates exponentially towards the base of the mesopelagic zone and only about 1% of the surface production reaches the sea floor. The largest component of biomass are marine protists (eukaryotic microoorganisms). Marine snow aggregates collected from the bathypelagic zone were found to consist largely of fungi and labyrinthulomycetes. Smaller aggregates do not harbor as many eukaryotic organisms which is similar to what is found in the deep ocean. The bathypelagic aggregates mostly resembled those found in the surface ocean. It implies higher rates of reminerlization in the bathypelagic zone. Numerically, the largest component of marine snow are the prokaryotes that colonize the aggregates. Bacteria are largely responsible for the remineralisation and fragmentation of aggregates. Remineralization occurs typically below 200 m depth. Microbial communities that form on the aggregates vary from the communities in the water column. The concentration of attached microbes are typically orders of magnitude larger than free-living microbes. Isolated bacterial cultures have up to 20-times more enzymatic activity within 2 hours of aggregate attachment. The dark ocean harbors around 65% of all pelagic Bacteria and Archaea.(Whitman et al., 1998) It was previously thought that due to fragmentation, bacterial communities would shift as they travel down the water column. As seen in experiments, it now appears that the communities that form during aggregation remain associated with the aggregate and any community changes are due to grazing or fragmentation rather than new bacterial colony formation. = Carbon cycling = The deep ocean harbors more than 98% of the dissolved inorganic carbon(DIC) pool. Along with a rapid sedimentation rate that results in low particulate organic carbon(POC) inputs It is yet to be resolved what effect microbes have on the global carbon cycle. Studies show that microbes in the deep ocean are not dormant, but are metabolically active and must be participating in nutrient cycling by not only heterotrophs but by autotrophs as well. There is a mismatch from the microbial carbon demand in the deep ocean and the carbon export from the surface ocean. DIC fixation is on similar orders of magnitude as heterotrophic microbes in the surface ocean. Model based data reveal DIC fixation ranges from 1 mmol C m‚àí2 d‚àí1 to 2.5 mmol C m‚àí2 d‚àí2.  Microenvironments  Large aggregates can become anoxic which give rise to anaerobic metabolisms. Typically anaerobic metabolisms are confined to areas where it is more energetically favorable. Give the abundance of denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria it is thought that these metabolisms are able to thrive within marine snow aggregates. In a model developed by Bianchi et al., it shows the various redox potentials within an aggregate. Implications Because of the relatively long residence time of the ocean's thermohaline circulation, carbon transported as marine snow into the deep ocean by the biological pump can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years. That is, when the marine snow is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved carbon dioxide, these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to ocean circulation. Consequently, enhancing the quantity of marine snow that reaches the deep ocean is the basis of several geoengineering schemes to enhance carbon sequestration by the ocean. Ocean nourishment and iron fertilisation seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in marine snow reaching the deep ocean. These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system. Increases in ocean temperatures, a projected indicator of climate change, may result in a decrease in the production of marine snow due to the enhanced stratification of the water column. Increasing stratification decreases the availability of phytoplankton nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid, and could lead to a decrease in primary production and, thus, marine snow. The microbial communities associated with marine snow are also interesting microbiologists. Recent research indicates transported bacteria may exchange genes with previously thought to be isolated populations of bacteria inhabiting the breadth of the ocean floor. In such an immense area there may be as yet undiscovered species tolerant of high pressures and extreme cold, perhaps finding use in bioengineering and pharmacy.

The somatosensory system is a complex system of sensory neurons and neural pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body. The axons (as afferent nerve fibers) of sensory neurons connect with, or respond to, various receptor cells. These sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and nociception, giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron, such as a thermoreceptor which carries information about temperature changes. Other types include mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and nociceptors which send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing. Sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin, epithelial tissues, muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system. Touch is a crucial means of receiving information. This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people.Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses,O. Franzen, R. Johansson, L. Terenius (1996) Somesthesis and the Neurobiology of the Somatosensory Cortex with the understanding that somesthesis includes the sense of touch, proprioception (sense of position and movement), and (depending on usage) haptic perception. The mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called somatotopy. In the cortex, it is also referred to as the cortical homunculus. This brain-surface (\\"cortical\\") map is not immutable, however. Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.  System overview  This diagram linearly (unless otherwise mentioned) tracks the projections of all known structures that allow for touch to their relevant endpoints in the human brain. = Sensory receptors = The four mechanoreceptors in the skin each respond to different stimuli for short or long periods. Merkel cell nerve endings are found in the basal epidermis and hair follicles; they react to low vibrations (5‚Äì15 Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges. Due to having a small receptive field (extremely detailed info), they are used in areas like fingertips the most; they are not covered (shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods. Tactile corpuscles react to moderate vibration (10‚Äì50 Hz) and light touch. They are located in the dermal papillae; due to their reactivity, they are primarily located in fingertips and lips. They respond in quick action potentials, unlike Merkel nerve endings. They are responsible for the ability to read Braille and feel gentle stimuli. Pacinian corpuscles determine gross touch and distinguish rough and soft substances. They react in quick action potentials, especially to vibrations around 250 Hz (even up to centimeters away). They are the most sensitive to vibrations and have large receptor fields. Pacinian corpuscles react only to sudden stimuli so pressures like clothes that are always compressing their shape are quickly ignored. They have also been implicated in detecting the location of touch sensations on handheld tools. Bulbous corpuscles react slowly and respond to sustained skin stretch. They are responsible for the feeling of object slippage and play a major role in the kinesthetic sense and control of finger position and movement. Merkel and bulbous cells - slow-response - are myelinated; the rest - fast-response - are not. All of these receptors are activated upon pressures that squish their shape causing an action potential.Par√©, Michel, and Catherine Behets. \\"Paucity of Presumptive Ruffini Corpuscles in the Index Finger Pad of Humans.\\" Wiley Online Library. 10 Feb. 2003.

BA3 receives the densest projections from the thalamus. BA3a is involved with the sense of relative position of neighboring body parts and amount of effort being used during movement. BA3b is responsible for distributing somatosensory information, it projects texture information to BA1 and shape and size information to BA2. Region S2 (secondary somatosensory cortex) divides into Area S2 and parietal ventral area. Area S2 is involved with specific touch perception and is thus integrally linked with the amygdala and hippocampus to encode and reinforce memories. Parietal ventral area is the somatosensory relay to the premotor cortex and somatosensory memory hub, BA5. BA5 is the topographically organized somato memory field and association area. BA1 processes texture info while BA2 processes size + shape info. Area S2 processes light touch, pain, visceral sensation, and tactile attention. S1 processes the remaining info (crude touch, pain, temperature). BA7 integrates visual and proprioceptive info to locate objects in space. The insular cortex (insula) plays a role in the sense of bodily-ownership, bodily self-awareness, and perception. Insula also plays a role in conveying info about sensual touch, pain, temperature, itch, and local oxygen status. Insula is a highly connected relay and thus is involved in numerous functions.  Structure  The somatosensory system is spread through all major parts of the vertebrate body. It consists both of sensory receptors and afferent neurons in the periphery (skin, muscle and organs for example), to deeper neurons within the central nervous system. General somatosensory pathway All afferent touch/vibration info ascends the spinal cord via the posterior (dorsal) column-medial lemniscus pathway via gracilis (T7 and below) or cuneatus (T6 and above). Cuneatus sends signals to the cochlear nucleus indirectly via spinal grey matter, this info is used in determining if a perceived sound is just villi noise/irritation. All fibers cross (left becomes right) in the medulla. A somatosensory pathway will typically have three neurons:Saladin KS. Anatomy and Physiology 3rd edd. 2004. McGraw-Hill, New York. first-order, second-order, and third-order. # The first-order neuron is a type of pseudounipolar neuron and always has its cell body in the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerve with a peripheral axon innervating touch mechanoreceptors and a central axon synapsing on the second- order neuron. If the somatosensory pathway is in parts of the head or neck not covered by the cervical nerves, the first-order neuron will be the trigeminal nerve ganglia or the ganglia of other sensory cranial nerves). # The second- order neuron has its cell body either in the spinal cord or in the brainstem. This neuron's ascending axons will cross (decussate) to the opposite side either in the spinal cord or in the brainstem. # In the case of touch and certain types of pain, the third-order neuron has its cell body in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus and ends in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe in the primary somatosensory cortex (or S1). tickled by an older sister. Photoreceptors, similar to those found in the retina of the eye, detect potentially damaging ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet A specifically), inducing increased production of melanin by melanocytes. Thus tanning potentially offers the skin rapid protection from DNA damage and sunburn caused by ultraviolet radiation (DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B). However, whether this offers protection is debatable, because the amount of melanin released by this process is modest in comparison to the amounts released in response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B radiation. =Tactile feedback= The tactile feedback from proprioception is derived from the proprioceptors in the skin, muscles, and joints. =Balance= The receptor for the sense of balance resides in the vestibular system in the ear (for the three-dimensional orientation of the head, and by inference, the rest of the body). Balance is also mediated by the kinesthetic reflex fed by proprioception (which senses the relative location of the rest of the body to the head). In addition, proprioception estimates the location of objects which are sensed by the visual system (which provides confirmation of the place of those objects relative to the body), as input to the mechanical reflexes of the body. =Fine touch and crude touch= The cortical homunculus, a map of somatosensory areas of the brain, was devised by Wilder Penfield. Fine touch (or discriminative touch) is a sensory modality that allows a subject to sense and localize touch. The form of touch where localization is not possible is known as crude touch. The posterior column‚Äìmedial lemniscus pathway is the pathway responsible for the sending of fine touch information to the cerebral cortex of the brain. Crude touch (or non-discriminative touch) is a sensory modality that allows the subject to sense that something has touched them, without being able to localize where they were touched (contrasting \\"fine touch\\"). Its fibres are carried in the spinothalamic tract, unlike the fine touch, which is carried in the dorsal column. As fine touch normally works in parallel to crude touch, a person will be able to localize touch until fibres carrying fine touch (Posterior column‚Äìmedial lemniscus pathway) have been disrupted. Then the subject will feel the touch, but be unable to identify where they were touched. =Neural processing of social touch= The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. Affective touch is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex and is processed in a similar way to emotions invoked by sight and sound, as exemplified by the increase of adrenaline caused by the social touch of a loved one, as opposed to the physical inability to touch someone you don't love. Meanwhile, the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood-oxygen-level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity. =Individual variation= A variety of studies have measured and investigated the causes for differences between individuals in the sense of fine touch. One well-studied area is passive tactile spatial acuity, the ability to resolve the fine spatial details of an object pressed against the stationary skin. A variety of methods have been used to measure passive tactile spatial acuity, perhaps the most rigorous being the grating orientation task. In this task subjects identify the orientation of a grooved surface presented in two different orientations, which can be applied manually or with automated equipment. Many studies have shown a decline in passive tactile spatial acuity with age; the reasons for this decline are unknown, but may include loss of tactile receptors during normal aging. Remarkably, index finger passive tactile spatial acuity is better among adults with smaller index fingertips; this effect of finger size has been shown to underlie the better passive tactile spatial acuity of women, on average, compared to men. The density of tactile corpuscles, a type of mechanoreceptor that detects low-frequency vibrations, is greater in smaller fingers; the same may hold for Merkel cells, which detect the static indentations important for fine spatial acuity. Among children of the same age, those with smaller fingers also tend to have better tactile acuity. Many studies have shown that passive tactile spatial acuity is enhanced among blind individuals compared to sighted individuals of the same age, possibly because of cross modal plasticity in the cerebral cortex of blind individuals. Perhaps also due to cortical plasticity, individuals who have been blind since birth reportedly consolidate tactile information more rapidly than sighted people. Clinical significance A somatosensory deficiency may be caused by a peripheral neuropathy involving peripheral nerves of the somatosensory system. This may present as numbness or paresthesia. Society and culture Haptic technology can provide touch sensation in virtual and real environments. In the field of speech therapy, tactile feedback can be used to treat speech disorders.

The club met at the Crown and Anchor on Arundel Street, in London.  Membership  The original inspiration for its formation came from the Rev. Sydney Smith's older brother, Robert - nicknamed \\"Bobus\\" after gaining the reputation at Eton for being such a clever Latin \\"versifier\\". The founding members were a group of friends who first met at the house of James Mackintosh in February, 1798. As well as Mackintosh, the group comprised Samuel Rogers, James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, Richard \\"Conversation\\" Sharp, the historian John Allen and Robert Smith and by 1801 what had started as a small clique of friends had become a properly constituted club comprising the following members, * Richard Porson * Smithson Tennant * John Courtney * Bryan Edwards * \\"Bobus\\" Smith * Jo. Richardson * John Allen * Samuel Rogers * Charles Butler * Richard Sharp * James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger * James Mackintosh * William Dickinson * John Whishaw * Josiah Wedgwood II * Pierre Etienne Louis Dumont * Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland * Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baronet Within seven years the club expanded to include such additional illustrious names as * Thomas Moore * John Wedgwood * Henry Brougham * Thomas Creevey * William Smith * Lord Petty * George Philips * Francis Horner * Rev. Peter Elmsley * Samuel Romilly * John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley * Rev. Sydney Smith * John Hoppner * Samuel Boddington The King of Clubs had by now become well known throughout London as an exclusive Whig dining club where erudite conversation on all matters pertaining to books, authors and literature took place, but where the discussion of politics was positively excluded. Tom Campbell described the club as \\"a gathering-place of brilliant talkers, dedicated to the meetings of the reigning wits of London\\". The annual subscription had originally been set at 2 guineas but this was reduced to ¬£2 in 1804, raised to 3 guineas in 1808, and finally fixed at ¬£3 in 1810. As a dining club, an additional charge of 10 shillings and 6 pence was made for dinner, a considerable sum in those days, and princely suppers were held in Harley Street and later at the Crown and Anchor,see Walford's reference in London, Old and New vol. 3, page 75. Arundel Street, in the Strand. The Crown and Anchor was the very inn where Samuel Johnson and James Boswell had once enjoyed supping together; and it was especially popular among the Whigs after it had hosted a great banquet in honour of Fox's birthday in 1798, when an enormous crowd of 2000 Reformers had toasted The People ‚Äì the Source of Power! Such was the popularity of the King of Clubs, and so sought after did membership become, that in 1808 a decision was taken to limit membership to a maximum of thirty people who were resident in England. By this time the membership had gained: * Lord Melbourne * Earl Cowper * William Blake * Abercromby (Lord Dunfermline) * Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton * Charles Kinnaird, 8th Lord Kinnaird * Henry Luttrell * R.P. Knight * Thomas Malthus * Lord John Townshend MP * John Fleming * John Playfair * George Lamb * Lord King * Henry Hallam * David Ricardo * Lord Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman In 1797 Bobus Smith, the originator of the club, accepted a seven-year posting in India as Advocate General of Bengal. His move abroad was a great loss to the King of Clubs and while he was away he asked Richard Sharp to perform a number of duties for him: Sydney Smith came to London and took his brother's place at the club in 1803/4, having previously worked with Francis Jeffrey and Henry Brougham on the Edinburgh Review, a renowned Whig literary magazine, which, with Allen, he had helped to initiate. When he arrived in the city, the irrepressible Sydney formed an immediate attachment to the King of Clubs and his unique sense of humour quickly endeared him to other members and gave meetings an added piquancy. The club lost another of its original members when Sir James Mackintosh, recently knighted, accepted the post of Recordership of Bombay in 1804 and followed in Bobus's footsteps. A record book of the King of Clubs has been preserved and a typical meeting of about this time (1804) lists the following members in attendance: * Richard Porson * Richard Sharp * James Scarlett * Sir James Mackintosh * Rev. Sydney Smith * Samuel Boddington * Hon. William Drummond * George Philips Manchester * Henry Luttrell * David Ricardo * Charles Kinnaird, 8th Lord Kinnaird Lower Grosvenor St  Meetings  Meetings of the King of Clubs did not always take place at the Crown and Anchor, and after 1819 they were held at the Freemasons' Tavern, at Grillions in Albemarle Street, and latterly at the Clarendon Hotel. A surviving account from one of the club's early meetings shows that a dinner for twelve members cost a ¬£24, which included two bottles of Madeira, three bottles of Sherry, two bottles of Port and three bottles of Claret. Despite such unashamed conviviality there is no evidence that alcohol in any way impeded the flow or the quality of the conversation that took place, and we may imagine that the reverse was probably the case since the atmosphere was always a happy blend of the jovial and the serious. It was expected that members should give time to the preparation of their bon-mots, witticisms and anecdotes so that in due course these could be woven into the discussion as productively and effectively as possible. Peter William ClaydenClayden, P. W. 'The Early Life of Samuel Rogers', page 423 Smith, Elder & Co. 1887 recalls how on one occasion Sharp, in fun, chanced upon Boddington's notes before a meeting, made a mental note of all his stories and brought them into the conversation before Boddington could relate them himself. The preparation that members were expected to undertake before attending meetings of the King of Clubs does not seem to have spoiled either the spontaneity of what occurred or the enjoyment of those who attended. Yet when Francis Horner had his first experience of the club, on 10 April 1802, he gained a very mixed impression, finding the conversation less animated than he had anticipated but attributing this to the absence of Sydney Smith: Horner regretted that there was no discussion of political ideas and complained that Sharp and Mackintosh seemed to be too much in agreement with one another, \\"as if they belonged to a kind of sect\\". In a sense this remark was quite true, but Horner was quite happy to become a member of the sect himself that year and Clayden confirms that by 1804 Mackintosh and Sydney Smith had established \\"a kind of society\\" which still held parties \\"once or twice every week\\" in their own homes. In effect these were a continuation of the informal meetings which had started in 1798 and which Horner was now happy to attend. As far as the more formal meetings of the club were concerned there was broad agreement by members that James Mackintosh and Sydney Smith were the most brilliant contributors.see for example,Letter from Sydney Smith to James Mackintosh, 20.2.1805. MS National Library of Scotland Tom Moore felt that certain of the group, Mackintosh included, invested so much of their time and energy in club proceedings that their literary and professional careers suffered as a direct consequence, but whatever the risks, the King of Clubs enjoyed immense status as a place where superb conversation might be found and accordingly membership became more keenly sought than ever. In 1809, and mindful of those times when he had been in financial straits, Sydney Smith wrote dryly to Lady Holland: Smith added pointedly: At one stage it was proposed by Mackintosh that the conversation and witticisms of their meetings should be recorded in a literary magazine, to be called The Bachelor. It was felt that there existed more than sufficient material to support a twice-weekly publication, but although the idea had the support of Rogers, Robert Smith, Scarlett and Sharp, the project never materialised. Consequently, though the Club's meetings spanned a quarter of a century, few details have survived of the bonhomie, the magic and the sparkling conversation that went on at them. The reason for the final demise of the club is not known but the poet Thomas Campbell became a frequent guest and in the following letter to a friend he reflects on some of the reasons why he himself gradually became disenchanted:  Ending  As a creative phenomenon perhaps it was inevitable that the King of Clubs should enjoy an initial period of rapid growth, reach a high point of maturity, and then suffer a final decline. Perhaps the appeal of such a club went out of fashion, or perhaps more likely it simply outgrew itself and became a victim of its own success. As more and more people with diverse personalities and different conversational skills became members, the dynamics of the group must inevitably have changed and in Campbell's view the club was ultimately consumed in the heat of its own incandescence. But as it came towards its end, the final glowing embers were not easily extinguished in the hearts of members and many warm memories were kept alive. A good number of those who had attended meetings for much of their lives would reflect nostalgically in old age on what wonderfully pleasurable times had been spent at the club. Richard Sharp summed up the sentiment at the very end of his life, when he wrote to Scarlett on 13 November 1834: ReferencesExternal links *An early description of the club in W.P.

The academic field concerned with hearing is auditory science. Sound may be heard through solid, liquid, or gaseous matter. It is one of the traditional five senses; partial or total inability to hear is called hearing loss. In humans and other vertebrates, hearing is performed primarily by the auditory system: mechanical waves, known as vibrations, are detected by the ear and transduced into nerve impulses that are perceived by the brain (primarily in the temporal lobe). Like touch, audition requires sensitivity to the movement of molecules in the world outside the organism. Both hearing and touch are types of mechanosensation.  Hearing mechanism The middle ear uses three tiny bones, the malleus, the incus, and the stapes, to convey vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. There are three main components of the human auditory system: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. =Outer ear= The outer ear includes the pinna, the visible part of the ear, as well as the ear canal, which terminates at the eardrum, also called the tympanic membrane. The pinna serves to focus sound waves through the ear canal toward the eardrum. Because of the asymmetrical character of the outer ear of most mammals, sound is filtered differently on its way into the ear depending on the location of its origin. This gives these animals the ability to localize sound vertically. The eardrum is an airtight membrane, and when sound waves arrive there, they cause it to vibrate following the waveform of the sound. Cerumen (ear wax) is produced by ceruminous and sebaceous glands in the skin of the human ear canal, protecting the ear canal and tympanic membrane from physical damage and microbial invasion. =Middle ear= The middle ear consists of a small air-filled chamber that is located medial to the eardrum. Within this chamber are the three smallest bones in the body, known collectively as the ossicles which include the malleus, incus, and stapes (also known as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, respectively). They aid in the transmission of the vibrations from the eardrum into the inner ear, the cochlea. The purpose of the middle ear ossicles is to overcome the impedance mismatch between air waves and cochlear waves, by providing impedance matching. Also located in the middle ear are the stapedius muscle and tensor tympani muscle, which protect the hearing mechanism through a stiffening reflex. The stapes transmits sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window, a flexible membrane separating the air-filled middle ear from the fluid-filled inner ear. The round window, another flexible membrane, allows for the smooth displacement of the inner ear fluid caused by the entering sound waves. =Inner ear= The inner ear is a small but very complex organ. The inner ear consists of the cochlea, which is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled tube. It is divided lengthwise by the organ of Corti, which is the main organ of mechanical to neural transduction. Inside the organ of Corti is the basilar membrane, a structure that vibrates when waves from the middle ear propagate through the cochlear fluid ‚Äì endolymph. The basilar membrane is tonotopic, so that each frequency has a characteristic place of resonance along it. Characteristic frequencies are high at the basal entrance to the cochlea, and low at the apex. Basilar membrane motion causes depolarization of the hair cells, specialized auditory receptors located within the organ of Corti. While the hair cells do not produce action potentials themselves, they release neurotransmitter at synapses with the fibers of the auditory nerve, which does produce action potentials. In this way, the patterns of oscillations on the basilar membrane are converted to spatiotemporal patterns of firings which transmit information about the sound to the brainstem. =Neuronal= The lateral lemnisci (red) connects lower brainstem auditory nuclei to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain. The sound information from the cochlea travels via the auditory nerve to the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem. From there, the signals are projected to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain tectum. The inferior colliculus integrates auditory input with limited input from other parts of the brain and is involved in subconscious reflexes such as the auditory startle response. The inferior colliculus in turn projects to the medial geniculate nucleus, a part of the thalamus where sound information is relayed to the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. Sound is believed to first become consciously experienced at the primary auditory cortex. Around the primary auditory cortex lies Wernickes area, a cortical area involved in interpreting sounds that is necessary to understand spoken words. Disturbances (such as stroke or trauma) at any of these levels can cause hearing problems, especially if the disturbance is bilateral. In some instances it can also lead to auditory hallucinations or more complex difficulties in perceiving sound.  Hearing tests  Hearing can be measured by behavioral tests using an audiometer. Electrophysiological tests of hearing can provide accurate measurements of hearing thresholds even in unconscious subjects. Such tests include auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABR), otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and electrocochleography (ECochG). Technical advances in these tests have allowed hearing screening for infants to become widespread. Hearing can be measured by mobile applications which includes audiological hearing test function or hearing aid application. These applications allow the user to measure hearing thresholds at different frequencies (audiogram). Despite possible errors in measurements, hearing loss can be detected.  Hearing loss  There are several different types of hearing loss: Conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed types. *Conductive hearing loss *Sensorineural hearing loss *Mixed hearing loss There are defined degrees of hearing loss: * Mild hearing loss - People with mild hearing loss have difficulties keeping up with conversations, especially in noisy surroundings. The most quiet sounds that people with mild hearing loss can hear with their better ear are between 25 and 40 dB HL. * Moderate hearing loss - People with moderate hearing loss have difficulty keeping up with conversations when they are not using a hearing aid. On average, the most quiet sounds heard by people with moderate hearing loss with their better ear are between 40 and 70 dB HL. * Severe hearing loss - People with severe hearing loss depend on powerful hearing aid. However, they often rely on lip-reading even when they are using hearing aids. The most quiet sounds heard by people with severe hearing loss with their better ear are between 70 and 95 dB HL. * Profound hearing loss - People with profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language. The most quiet sounds heard by people with profound hearing loss with their better ear are from 95 dB HL or more. = Causes = *Heredity *Congenital conditions *Presbycusis *Acquired Noise-induced hearing loss Ototoxic drugs and chemicals Infection = Prevention = Hearing protection is the use of devices designed to prevent Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL), a type of post-lingual hearing impairment. The various means used to prevent hearing loss generally focus on reducing the levels of noise to which people are exposed. One way this is done is through environmental modifications such as acoustic quieting, which may be achieved with as basic a measure as lining a room with curtains, or as complex a measure as employing an anechoic chamber, which absorbs nearly all sound. Another means is the use of devices such as earplugs, which are inserted into the ear canal to block noise, or earmuffs, objects designed to cover a person's ears entirely. = Management = The loss of hearing, when it is caused by neural loss, cannot presently be cured. Instead, its effects can be mitigated by the use of audioprosthetic devices, i.e. hearing assistive devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. In a clinical setting, this management is offered by otologists and audiologists. = Relation to health = Hearing loss is associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia with a greater degree of hearing loss tied to a higher risk. There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and hearing loss.  Hearing underwater  Hearing threshold and the ability to localize sound sources are reduced underwater in humans, but not in aquatic animals, including whales, seals, and fish which have ears adapted to process water-borne sound.  In vertebrates  A cat can hear high-frequency sounds up to two octaves higher than a human. Not all sounds are normally audible to all animals. Each species has a range of normal hearing for both amplitude and frequency. Many animals use sound to communicate with each other, and hearing in these species is particularly important for survival and reproduction. In species that use sound as a primary means of communication, hearing is typically most acute for the range of pitches produced in calls and speech. =Frequency range= Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called audio or sonic. The range is typically considered to be between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as ultrasonic, while frequencies below audio are referred to as infrasonic. Some bats use ultrasound for echolocation while in flight. Dogs are able to hear ultrasound, which is the principle of 'silent' dog whistles. Snakes sense infrasound through their jaws, and baleen whales, giraffes, dolphins and elephants use it for communication. Some fish have the ability to hear more sensitively due to a well-developed, bony connection between the ear and their swim bladder. This \\"aid to the deaf\\" for fishes appears in some species such as carp and herring.  In invertebrates  Even though they don‚Äôt have ears, invertebrates have developed other structures and systems to decode vibrations traveling through the air, or ‚Äúsound.‚Äù Charles Henry Turner (zoologist) was the first scientist to formally show this phenomenon through rigorously controlled experiments in ants Turner CH. 1923. The homing of the Hymenoptera. Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis 24: 27‚Äì45 . Turner ruled out the detection of ground vibration and suggested that other insects likely have auditory systems as well. Many insects detect sound through the way air vibrations deflect hairs along their body. Some insects have even developed specialized hairs tuned to detecting particular frequencies, such as certain caterpillar species that have evolved hair with properties such that it resonates most with the sound of buzzing wasps, thus warning them of the presence of natural enemies. Tautz, J√ºrgen, and Michael Rost√°s. \\"Honeybee buzz attenuates plant damage by caterpillars.\\" Current Biology 18, no. 24 (2008): R1125-R1126. . Some insects possess a tympanal organ. These are \\"eardrums\\", that cover air filled chambers on the legs. Similar to the hearing process with vertebrates, the eardrums react to sonar waves. Receptors that are placed on the inside translate the oscillation into electric signals and send them to the brain. Several groups of flying insects that are preyed upon by echolocating bats can perceive the ultrasound emissions this way and reflexively practice ultrasound avoidance.

The South Somerset district occupies an area of , stretching from its borders with Devon and Dorset to the edge of the Somerset Levels. The district has a population of about 158,000, and has Yeovil as its administrative centre. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. There are 94 Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers‚Äîa collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers‚Äîbut there are other religious buildings as well. Muchelney Abbey consists of the remains and foundations of a medieval Benedictine Abbey and an early Tudor house dating from the 16th century, formerly the lodgings of the resident abbot. Stavordale Priory was built as a priory church in the 13th century and was converted into a private residence in 1533. The Hamstone Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is a 14th-century former priest's house of the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, which after 1518 become a farm known as Parsonage Farmhouse. It remained a farm until about 1960, and has been owned by the National Trust since 1946. Since the Reformation the 13th century Hanging Chapel in Langport has been a town hall, courthouse, grammar school, museum, and armoury before becoming a masonic hall in 1891. The house known as The Abbey in Charlton Mackrell takes its name from the site on which it was built, the Chantry Chapel of the Holy Spirit, founded in 1237. Naish Priory, built around 1400 in East Coker, was never a priory, and similarly the Abbey Farm House and Abbey Barn in Yeovil which date from around 1420, have always been in lay-ownership; \\"abbey\\" was added to their names in the 19th century. The Burton Pynsent Monument was designed in 1757, by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown for William Pitt, as a monument to Sir William Pynsent. King Alfred's Tower, a high triangular edifice, stands near Egbert's stone, where it is believed Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, rallied the Saxons in May 878 before the Battle of Edington. The tower's funder, Henry Hoare, planned for it to commemorate the end of the Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III. The other Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset are manor houses, built over long periods by local Lords of the Manor. In 1907, the Tudor Barrington Court became the first country house acquired by the National Trust, on the recommendation of the antiquarian Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley. Newton Surmaville was built between 1608 and 1612 for Robert Harbin, a Yeovil merchant, on the site of an earlier building, but was extensively altered and enhanced in the 1870s. Lytes Cary and its associated chapel and gardens have parts dating to as early as the 14th century. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner praised it, saying \\"Yet all parts blend to perfection with one another and with the gentle sunny landscape that surrounds them.\\" The 17th century house at Tintinhull is surrounded by a small 20th century Arts and Crafts garden. Ven House, which stands on an artificially raised terrace, has a rectangular plan of seven bays by five bays, and is built of red brick in Flemish bond, with local Hamstone dressings; its north and south fronts are divided by two giant Corinthian pilasters. The small William and Mary style house was completed sometime between 1698 and 1700. It was enlarged between 1725 and 1730 by Decimus Burton, who provided a new drawing room for Sir W. Medleycott and also an orangery attached to the house. Brympton d'Evercy, built in stages between about 1220 and the 18th century, has been described, by Auberon Waugh, as \\"the most beautiful house in England\\".

Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis.Human biology (Page 201/464) Daniel D. Chiras. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2005. The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000Boron, W.F., E.L. Boulpaep. 2003. Medical Physiology. 1st ed. Elsevier Science USA. taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami). Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another. Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th Edition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354 The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth‚Äîother factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose;Smell - The Nose Knows washington.edu, Eric H.

As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.Why do two great tastes sometimes not taste great together? scientificamerican.com. Dr. Tim Jacob, Cardiff University. 22 May 2009. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons. Among humans, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. Humans can also have distortion of tastes through dysgeusia. Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities. Basic tastes Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods‚Äô nutritional value. Digestive enzymes in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this are the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. Bitter foods are generally found unpleasant, while sour, salty, sweet, and umami tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation. The five specific tastes received by taste receptors are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and savoriness, often known by its Japanese term \\"umami\\" which translates to ‚Äòdeliciousness‚Äô. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified, (a partial translation from ) but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste. One study found that both salt and sour taste mechanisms detect, in different ways, the presence of sodium chloride (salt) in the mouth. However, acids are also detected and perceived as sour. The detection of salt is important to many organisms, but specifically mammals, as it serves a critical role in ion and water homeostasis in the body. It is specifically needed in the mammalian kidney as an osmotically active compound which facilitates passive re-uptake of water into the blood. Because of this, salt elicits a pleasant taste in most humans. Sour and salt tastes can be pleasant in small quantities, but in larger quantities become more and more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals acids, which can cause serious tissue damage. Bitter is a generally negative flavor, though its method of action is unknown. It has the characteristic of accustomed enjoyment. Sweet taste signals the presence of carbohydrates in solution. Since carbohydrates have a very high calorie count (saccharides have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy (sugars) and storage of energy (glycogen). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had. The savory taste (known in Japanese as \\"umami\\") was identified by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, which signals the presence of the amino acid L-glutamate, triggers a pleasurable response and thus encourages the intake of peptides and proteins. The amino acids in proteins are used in the body to build muscles and organs, transport molecules (hemoglobin), antibodies, and the organic catalysts known as enzymes. These are all critical molecules, and as such it is important to have a steady supply of amino acids, hence the pleasurable response to their presence in the mouth. Pungency (piquancy or hotness) had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste. In 2015, researchers suggested a new basic taste of fatty acids called fat taste, although oleogustus and pinguis have both been proposed as alternate terms. =Sweetness= The diagram above depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sweet taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is one taste cell of the taste bud, and object C is the neuron attached to the taste cell. I. Part I shows the reception of a molecule. 1. Sugar, the first messenger, binds to a protein receptor on the cell membrane. II. Part II shows the transduction of the relay molecules. 2. G Protein-coupled receptors, second messengers, are activated. 3. G Proteins activate adenylate cyclase, an enzyme, which increases the cAMP concentration. Depolarization occurs. 4. The energy, from step 3, is given to activate the K+, potassium, protein channels.III. Part III shows the response of the taste cell. 5. Ca+, calcium, protein channels is activated.6. The increased Ca+ concentration activates neurotransmitter vesicles. 7. The neuron connected to the taste bud is stimulated by the neurotransmitters. Sweetness, usually regarded as a pleasurable sensation, is produced by the presence of sugars and substances that mimic sugar. Sweetness may be connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) coupled to the G protein gustducin found on the taste buds. At least two different variants of the \\"sweetness receptors\\" must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human detection threshold for sucrose is 10 millimoles per liter. For lactose it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 millimoles per liter. ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin. The gustducin then activates the molecule adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the production of the molecule cAMP, or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway. =Sourness= The diagram depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sour or salty taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1. If the taste is sour, H+ ions, from an acidic substances, pass through H+ channels. Depolarization takes place II. Part II is the transduction pathway of the relay molecules.2. Cation, such as K+, channels are opened. III. Part III is the response of the cell. 3. An influx of Ca+ ions is activated.4. The Ca+ activates neurotransmitters. 5. A signal is sent to the neuron attached to the taste bud. Sourness is the taste that detects acidity. The sourness of substances is rated relative to dilute hydrochloric acid, which has a sourness index of 1. By comparison, tartaric acid has a sourness index of 0.7, citric acid an index of 0.46, and carbonic acid an index of 0.06. Sour taste is detected by a small subset of cells that are distributed across all taste buds called Type III taste receptor cells. H+ ions (protons) that are abundant in sour substances can directly enter the Type III taste cells through a proton channel. This channel was identified in 2018 as otopetrin 1 (OTOP1). The transfer of positive charge into the cell can itself trigger an electrical response. Some weak acids such as acetic acid, can also penetrate taste cells; intracellular hydrogen ions inhibit potassium channels, which normally function to hyperpolarize the cell. By a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions through OTOP1 ion channels (which itself depolarizes the cell) and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter. The most common foods with natural sourness are fruits, such as lemon, grape, orange, tamarind, and bitter melon. Fermented foods, such as wine, vinegar or yogurt, may have sour taste. Children in the US and UK show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy containing citric acid or malic acid is common. =Saltiness= The simplest receptor found in the mouth is the sodium chloride (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions. Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is. A sodium channel in the taste cell wall allows sodium cations to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens voltage-dependent calcium channels, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to neurotransmitter release. This sodium channel is known as an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug amiloride in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered. The size of lithium and potassium ions most closely resemble those of sodium, and thus the saltiness is most similar. In contrast, rubidium and caesium ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly. The saltiness of substances is rated relative to sodium chloride (NaCl), which has an index of 1. Potassium, as potassium chloride (KCl), is the principal ingredient in salt substitutes and has a saltiness index of 0.6. Other monovalent cations, e.g. ammonium (NH4+), and divalent cations of the alkali earth metal group of the periodic table, e.g. calcium (Ca2+), ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an action potential. But the chloride of calcium is saltier and less bitter than potassium chloride, and is commonly used in pickle brine instead of KCl. =Bitterness= The diagram depicted above shows the signal transduction pathway of the bitter taste. Bitter taste has many different receptors and signal transduction pathways. Bitter indicates poison to animals. It is most similar to sweet. Object A is a taste bud, object B is one taste cell, and object C is a neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of a molecule.1. A bitter substance such as quinine, is consumed and binds to G Protein-coupled receptors.II. Part II is the transduction pathway 2. Gustducin, a G protein second messenger, is activated. 3. Phosphodiesterase, an enzyme, is then activated. 4. Cyclic nucleotide, cNMP, is used, lowering the concentration 5. Channels such as the K+, potassium, channels, close.III. Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron. Bitterness is one of the most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, South American mate, coca tea, bitter gourd, uncured olives, citrus peel, many plants in the family Brassicaceae, dandelion greens, horehound, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and gentian in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in tonic water. Bitterness is of interest to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchersLogue, A.W. (1986) The Psychology of Eating and Drinking. New York: W.H. Freeman & Co. since a large number of natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, and among leaf-eating primates there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves.Jones, S., Martin, R., & Pilbeam, D. (1994) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable.Johns, T. (1990). With Bitter Herbs They Shall Eat It: Chemical ecology and the origins of human diet and medicine. Tucson: University of Arizona Press Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species. The threshold for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages a concentration of 8 ŒºM (8 micromolar).Guyton, Arthur C. (1991) Textbook of Medical Physiology. (8th ed). Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1. For example, brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected at a much lower solution threshold. The most bitter natural substance is amarogentin a compound present in the roots of the plant Gentiana lutea and the most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an aversive agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. It was discovered accidentally in 1958 during research on a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland. Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as TAS2R38 coupled to the G protein gustducin are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances. They are identified not only by their ability to taste for certain \\"bitter\\" ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric). The TAS2R family in humans is thought to comprise about 25 different taste receptors, some of which can recognize a wide variety of bitter-tasting compounds. Over 670 bitter-tasting compounds have been identified, on a bitter database, of which over 200 have been assigned to one or more specific receptors. Recently it is speculated that the selective constraints on the TAS2R family have been weakened due to the relatively high rate of mutation and pseudogenization. Researchers use two synthetic substances, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) to study the genetics of bitter perception. These two substances taste bitter to some people, but are virtually tasteless to others. Among the tasters, some are so- called \\"supertasters\\" to whom PTC and PROP are extremely bitter. The variation in sensitivity is determined by two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus. This genetic variation in the ability to taste a substance has been a source of great interest to those who study genetics. Gustducin is made of three subunits. When it is activated by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate phosphodiesterase, a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes potassium ion channels. Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR. =Umami= Savory, or umami is an appetitive taste . It can be tasted in cheese and soy sauce. A loanword from Japanese meaning \\"good flavor\\" or \\"good taste\\",Êó®Âë≥ definition in English Denshi Jisho‚ÄîOnline Japanese dictionary is considered fundamental to many East Asian cuisines and dates back to the Romans' deliberate use of fermented fish sauce (also called garum). Umami was first studied in 1907 by Ikeda isolating dashi taste, which he identified as the chemical monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is a sodium salt that produces a strong savory taste, especially combined with foods rich in nucleotides such as meats, fish, nuts, and mushrooms. Some savory taste buds respond specifically to glutamate in the same way that \\"sweet\\" ones respond to sugar. Glutamate binds to a variant of G protein coupled glutamate receptors. L-glutamate may bond to a type of GPCR known as a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR4) which causes the G-protein complex to activate the sensation of umami. Measuring relative tastes Measuring the degree to which a substance presents one basic taste can be achieved in a subjective way by comparing its taste to a reference substance. Sweetness is subjectively measured by comparing the threshold values, or level at which the presence of a dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances. Substances are usually measured relative to sucrose, which is usually given an arbitrary index of 1 or 100. Rebaudioside A is 100 times sweeter than sucrose; Fructose is about 1.4 times sweeter, glucose, a sugar found in honey and vegetables, is about three-quarters as sweet; and lactose, a milk sugar, is one-half as sweet. The sourness of a substance can be rated by comparing it to very dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). Relative saltiness can be rated by comparison to a dilute salt solution.Food Chemistry (Page 38/1070) H. D. Belitz, Werner Grosch, Peter Schieberle. Springer, 2009. Quinine, a bitter medicinal found in tonic water, can be used to subjectively rate the bitterness of a substance. Units of dilute quinine hydrochloride (1 g in 2000 mL of water) can be used to measure the threshold bitterness concentration, the level at which the presence of a dilute bitter substance can be detected by a human taster, of other compounds.Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials, Pg. 38 World Health Organization, 1998. More formal chemical analysis, while possible, is difficult. There may not be an absolute measure for pungency, though there are tests for measuring the subjective presence of a given pungent substance in food, such as the Scoville scale for capsaicine in peppers or the Pyruvate scale for pyruvates in garlics and onions. Functional structure Taste buds and papillae of the tongue In the human body a stimulus refers to a form of energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. Sensory receptors are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical action potential which can be understood by the brain, the body's control center. Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory neurons modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from sensory receptors all over the body. Taste is a form of chemoreception which occurs in the specialised taste receptors in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste these receptors can detect which are recognized: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each type of receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that \\"gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, [a]lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant\\". Researchers believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make \\"keep or spit out\\" decisions when there is more than one tastant present. \\"No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli.\\"David V. Smith, Robert F. Margolskee: Making Sense of Taste (Scientific American, September 1, 2006) As well, serotonin is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of microvilli of the taste cells. ;Sweetness Sweetness is produced by the presence of sugars, some proteins, and other substances such as alcohols like anethol, glycerol and propylene glycol, saponins such as glycyrrhizin, artificial sweeteners (organic compounds with a variety of structures), and lead compounds such as lead acetate. It is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Many foods can be perceived as sweet despite of the sugar content, alcoholic drinks can taste sweet despite of having sugar or not, some plants such as liquorice, anise or stevia are sometimes used as sweeteners. Rebaudioside A is a steviol glycoside coming from stevia that is 200 times sweeter than sugar. Lead acetate and other lead compounds were used as sweeteners, mostly for wine, until lead poisoning became known. Romans used to deliberately boil the must inside of lead vessels to make a sweeter wine. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to a G protein that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, gustducin.How the Taste Bud Translates Between Tongue and Brain nytimes.com, 4 August 1992. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals. ;Saltiness Saltiness is a taste produced best by the presence of cations (such as , or ) and is directly detected by cation influx into glial like cells via leak channels causing depolarisation of the cell. Other monovalent cations, e.g., ammonium, , and divalent cations of the alkali earth metal group of the periodic table, e.g., calcium, , ions, in general, elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue. ;Sourness Sourness is acidity,outlines of chemistry with practical work (Page 241) Henry John Horstman Fenton. CUP Archive.Focus Ace Pmr 2009 Science (Page 242/522) Chang See Leong, Chong Kum Ying, Choo Yan Tong & Low Swee Neo. Focus Ace Pmr 2009 Science. and, like salt, it is a taste sensed using ion channels.channels in sensory cells (Page 155/304) Stephan Frings, Jonathan Bradley. Wiley-VCH, 2004. Undissociated acid diffuses across the plasma membrane of a presynaptic cell, where it dissociates in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle. The protons that are released then block potassium channels, which depolarise the cell and cause calcium influx. In addition, the taste receptor PKD2L1 has been found to be involved in tasting sour. ;Bitterness Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as TAS2R38 are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances. They are identified not only by their ability to taste certain bitter ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric). ;Savoriness The amino acid glutamic acid is responsible for savoriness,What Is Umami?: What Exactly is Umami? Umami Information Center but some nucleotides (inosinic acid and guanylic acid) can act as complements, enhancing the taste.Umami Food Ingredients Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 2007.What Is Umami?: The Composition of Umami Umami Information Center Glutamic acid binds to a variant of the G protein-coupled receptor, producing a savory taste. Further sensations and transmission The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the somatosensory system. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The facial nerve (VII) carries taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) carries taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity. The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) provides information concerning the general texture of food as well as the taste-related sensations of peppery or hot (from spices). =Pungency (also spiciness or hotness)= Substances such as ethanol and capsaicin cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat is caused by the food's activating nerves that express TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from chili peppers, piperine from black pepper, gingerol from ginger root and allyl isothiocyanate from horseradish. The piquant (\\"hot\\" or \\"spicy\\") sensation provided by such foods and spices plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world‚Äîespecially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as Ethiopian, Peruvian, Hungarian, Indian, Korean, Indonesian, Lao, Malaysian, Mexican, New Mexican, Singaporean, Southwest Chinese (including Sichuan cuisine), Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines. This particular sensation, called chemesthesis, is not a taste in the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and a different set of nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as \\"hot\\" results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, surface of the eye or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to hotness agents. =Coolness= Some substances activate cold trigeminal receptors even when not at low temperatures. This \\"fresh\\" or \\"minty\\" sensation can be tasted in peppermint, spearmint and is triggered by substances such as menthol, anethol, ethanol, and camphor. Caused by activation of the same mechanism that signals cold, TRPM8 ion channels on nerve cells, unlike the actual change in temperature described for sugar substitutes, this coolness is only a perceived phenomenon. =Numbness= Both Chinese and Batak Toba cooking include the idea of È∫ª (m√° or mati rasa), a tingling numbness caused by spices such as Sichuan pepper. The cuisines of Sichuan province in China and of the Indonesian province of North Sumatra often combine this with chili pepper to produce a È∫ªËæ£ m√°l√†, \\"numbing-and-hot\\", or \\"mati rasa\\" flavor. Typical in northern Brazilian cuisine, jambu is an herb used in dishes like tacac√°. These sensations although not taste fall into a category of chemesthesis. =Astringency= Some foods, such as unripe fruits, contain tannins or calcium oxalate that cause an astringent or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include tea, red wine, rhubarb, some fruits of the genus Syzygium, and unripe persimmons and bananas. Less exact terms for the astringent sensation are \\"dry\\", \\"rough\\", \\"harsh\\" (especially for wine), \\"tart\\" (normally referring to sourness), \\"rubbery\\", \\"hard\\" or \\"styptic\\". When referring to wine, dry is the opposite of sweet, and does not refer to astringency. Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as \\"dry\\", and \\"dry\\" wines are not necessarily astringent. In the Indian Ayurvedic tradition, one of the six tastes is astringency (kasaaya). In Sinhala and Sri Lankan English it is referred to as . In Tamil it is referred to as Thuvarppu. =Metallicness= A metallic taste may be caused by food and drink, certain medicines or amalgam dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste may be caused by galvanic reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current. Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the TRPV1 receptors. Many people consider blood to have a metallic taste. A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms dysgeusia or parageusia, referring to distortions of the sense of taste, and can be caused by medication, including saquinavir, zonisamide, and various kinds of chemotherapy, as well as occupational hazards, such as working with pesticides. =Fat taste= Recent research reveals a potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted as a possible lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), and it has been localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat. Other possible fat taste receptors have been identified. G protein-coupled receptors GPR120 and GPR40 have been linked to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid (linoleic acid and oleic acid), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids. Monovalent cation channel TRPM5 has been implicated in fat taste as well, but it is thought to be involved primarily in downstream processing of the taste rather than primary reception, as it is with other tastes such as bitter, sweet, and savory. Proposed alternate names to fat taste include oleogustus and pinguis, although these terms are not widely accepted. The main form of fat that is commonly ingested is triglycerides, which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids via lipases. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, a high concentration of fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible. To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish fat taste from other tastes, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual \\"creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides\\", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of fatty acids is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as \\"more of a warning system\\" that a certain food should not be eaten. There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities. Foods whose flavor to which fat taste makes a small contribution include olive oil and fresh butter, along with various kinds of vegetable and nut oils. = Heartiness = Kokumi (k/uÀàkuÀêmi/, Japanese: from ) is translated as \\"heartiness\\", \\"full flavor\\" or \\"rich\\" and describes compounds in food that do not have their own taste, but enhance the characteristics when combined. Alongside the five basic tastes of sweet, sour, salt, bitter and savory, kokumi has been described as something that may enhance the other five tastes by magnifying and lengthening the other tastes, or \\"mouthfulness\\". Garlic is a common ingredient to add flavor used to help define the characteristic kokumi flavors. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) are receptors for \\"kokumi\\" substances. Kokumi substances, applied around taste pores, induce an increase in the intracellular Ca concentration in a subset of cells. This subset of CaSR-expressing taste cells are independent from the influenced basic taste receptor cells. CaSR agonists directly activate the CaSR on the surface of taste cells and integrated in the brain via the central nervous system. However, a basal level of calcium, corresponding to the physiological concentration, is necessary for activation of the CaSR to develop the kokumi sensation. =Calcium= The distinctive taste of chalk has been identified as the calcium component of that substance. In 2008, geneticists discovered a calcium receptor on the tongues of mice. The CaSR receptor is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and brain. Along with the \\"sweet\\" T1R3 receptor, the CaSR receptor can detect calcium as a taste. Whether the perception exists or not in humans is unknown. =Temperature= Temperature can be an essential element of the taste experience. Heat can accentuate some flavors and decrease others by varying the density and phase equilibrium of a substance. Food and drink that‚Äîin a given culture‚Äîis traditionally served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, with a few exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups‚Äîagain, with exceptions‚Äîare usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are soft drinks. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season. =Starchiness= A 2016 study suggested that humans can taste starch (specifically, a glucose oligomer) independently of other tastes such as sweetness. However, no specific chemical receptor has yet been found for this taste. Nerve supply and neural connections This diagram linearly (unless otherwise mentioned) tracks the projections of all known structures that allow for taste to their relevant endpoints in the human brain. The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates a third of the tongue including the circumvallate papillae. The facial nerve innervates the other two thirds of the tongue and the cheek via the chorda tympani.Eliav, Eli, and Batya Kamran. \\"Evidence of Chorda Tympani Dysfunction in Patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome.\\" Science Direct. May 2007. Web. 27 March 2016. The pterygopalatine ganglia are ganglia (one on each side) of the soft palate. The greater petrosal, lesser palatine and zygomatic nerves all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the nasal cavity; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the lacrimal nerve that activate the lacrimal gland; which is the reason that spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are maxillary nerves (from the trigeminal nerve). The special visceral afferents of the vagus nerve carry taste from the epiglottal region of the tongue. The lingual nerve (trigeminal, not shown in diagram) is deeply interconnected with the chorda tympani in that it provides all other sensory info from the anterior ‚Öî of the tongue.Mu, Liancai, and Ira Sanders. \\"Human Tongue Neuroanatomy: Nerve Supply and Motor Endplates.\\" Wiley Online Library.

Other concepts=Taste as a philosophical concept= Taste can be objective in terms of the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) but it can also be subjective in terms of what we deem \\"good\\" and \\"bad.\\" Taste is \\"subjective, objective, and qualitative\\".Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print. In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. \\"'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)\\". We cannot tell someone they do not think something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement =Supertasters= A supertaster is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae. Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food to get the same satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.) =Aftertaste= Aftertastes arise after food has been swallowed. An aftertaste can differ from the food it follows. Medicines and tablets may also have a lingering aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as aspartame (artificial sweetener). =Acquired taste= An acquired taste often refers to an appreciation for a food or beverage that is unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it, usually because of some unfamiliar aspect of the food or beverage, including bitterness, a strong or strange odor, taste, or appearance. Clinical significance Patients with Addison's disease, pituitary insufficiency, or cystic fibrosis sometimes have a hyper-sensitivity to the five primary tastes. =Disorders of taste= * ageusia (complete loss of taste) * hypogeusia (reduced sense of taste) * dysgeusia (distortion in sense of taste) * hypergeusia (abnormally heightened sense of taste) History Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healing science, has its own tradition of basic tastes, comprising sweet, salty, sour, pungent, bitter & astringent.Ayurvedic balancing: an integration of Western fitness with Eastern wellness (Pages 25-26/188) Joyce Bueker. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2002. In the West, Aristotle postulated in c. 350 BCOn the Soul Aristotle. Translated by J. A. Smith. The Internet Classics Archive. that the two most basic tastes were sweet and bitter.Aristotle's De anima (422b10-16) Ronald M. Polansky. Cambridge University Press, 2007. He was one of the first identified persons to develop a list of basic tastes.Origins of neuroscience: a history of explorations into brain function (Page 165/480) Stanley Finger. Oxford University Press US, 2001. The Ancient Chinese regarded spiciness as a basic taste. Research The receptors for the basic tastes of bitter, sweet and savory have been identified. They are G protein-coupled receptors. The cells that detect sourness have been identified as a subpopulation that express the protein PKD2L1. The responses are mediated by an influx of protons into the cells but the receptor for sour is still unknown. The receptor for amiloride-sensitive attractive salty taste in mice has been shown to be a sodium channel. There is some evidence for a sixth taste that senses fatty substances. In 2010, researchers found bitter taste receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered. They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

It has been known for some time that these categories may not be comprehensive. In Guyton's 1976 edition of Textbook of Medical Physiology, he wrote: > On the basis of physiologic studies, there are generally believed to be at > least four primary sensations of taste: sour, salty, sweet, and bitter. Yet > we know that a person can perceive literally hundreds of different tastes. > These are all supposed to be combinations of the four primary > sensations...However, there might be other less conspicuous classes or > subclasses of primary sensations\\", b. Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. In fact there is a \\"plethora of methods\\" Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes. Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin & Margolskee (1994) for example, is essentially the same as that of Svrivastava & Rastogi (2003), Guyton & Hall (2006), and Joesten et al. (2007). The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they derive. As for the assignment of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points. Glucose remains about three- quarters as sweet as sucrose whether displayed as 75 or 0.75. ReferencesFurther reading Sensory systems Gustatory system ","title":"Taste"},{"id":"21282081","text":"G. V.

The ruins of the house are still visible just outside the grounds of the school. These two figures give their names to the two main buildings of the modern school. The grammar school's first headmaster was Reginald Hill. The grammar school later had separate boys and girls schools. Marple Hall County Grammar School for Girls opened in 1965 and had 750 girls in 1967, and 1000 by 1971. Marple Hall Grammar School for Boys had 1000 boys in 1972. In 1967 the girls school had a six form entry. The head teacher of the girls school up to 1974 was Miss Una Drake. =Comprehensive= The school was converted into the mixed sex Marple Hall County High School in September 1974 with a nine form entry. The joint headmaster, Derek J Saville, was appointed in September 1973. It was originally to be called Marple Hall County Comprehensive. From April 1974, the school was administered by Stockport MBC. The new school taught Russian in the sixth form and had 1900 boys and girls, with 450 in the sixth form. From 1974 until 1980, the school had comprehensive year groups and grammar (selective intake) year groups. The last selective intake, from entry in 1973, left in 1980; the first year group of comprehensive intake left in 1979 (after GCE O levels) and 1981 (after GCE A levels). Following Mr Saville's retirement, the sixth form was closed in 1990 after the arrival of the new Head, Margaret Cuckson. Miss Cuckson remained at Headteacher until 2004 when she was replaced by Mrs Lesley Calderbank and under whose tenure the school was in the news for having a year nine Maths class being taught by ten different teachers in two terms.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4439901.stm The previous Head, Dr Rose Hegan, took over in September 2010.

He creates a Trust with a sum of Rs. 47,200 out of which Rs. 10,000 was earmarked for the construction of a building for it. He did not live to see the building created; having contracted a fatal disease on a pilgrimage to Badri Nath in 1901, he died on 15 May 1902. He had satisfaction, however, of hearing just before he breathed his last that the foundation stone of the building had been laid. Lala Ram Charan Das another wealthy philanthropist had undertaken at his instance to put up a building for the library which he did at a cost of exceeding Rs. 22,000/- himself meeting the amount spent in excess of the sum of Rs. 10,000/- provided in the Trust. The building was formally opened on 12 May 1913 at a function presided over by Dr. Sir Sundar Lal. Speaking on the occasion Malaviya dwelt on the importance of propagating knowledge (Vidyadan), citing the Hindu Shastras in support of his views. Malaviya identified himself closely with the library. He had not taken a conspicuous part in establishing the library as he was away in Kalakankar editing the Hindustan till about a month before its foundation, but he was an enthusiastic supporter of the movement which it represented. His cousin Jai Govind Malaviya who was the principal teacher of Sanskrit at the Government High School Allahabad, had given it his priceless collection of Sanskrit manuscripts which together with the Hindi collection donated by Brij Mohan Lal Bhalla constituted the initial stock of the library. He was a member of the first Managing Committee which drew up its constitution and defined its aims and objects at its meeting on 26 November 1889. These were conceived in a liberal spirit and reflect the vision of the promoters. The books in the library were to be available to anyone who asked for them. The Library was to acquire books in Hindi and Sanskrit. It would accept books in other languages as gifts but not purchase them at a price. It would subscribe for at least ten journals-dailies, weeklies and monthlies. It was also to encourage writers of good books. A further object, later added at the time of registration of the Trust (but never implemented) was to collect manuscripts of Sanskrit and Hindi books and to edit and publish them within the limits of available funds. The Library received the constant care of its promoters, Lal Behari, Balkrishna Bhatt and Jai Govind Malaviya who met daily on the upper story of the house of Brij Mohan Lal Bhalla. Malaviya joined them frequently.

Background Bred and raced by Prince Ahmed bin Salman's The Thoroughbred Corp., Spain was out of the winning mare Drina. Her sire was Thunder Gulch, a winner of five Grade I races including the 1995 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. Spain was conditioned for racing by U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Racing career At age two, she made six starts, winning once. At age three, Spain had her best year. She got her first Grade I win in the La Brea Stakes at Santa Anita Park, then capped off her year with a win in the 2000 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs. Given little chance by bettors of defeating notable fillies such as Surfside and the heavily favored Riboletta, Spain was sent off at odds of more than 55:1. Her victory resulted in a winning $2 bet paying $113.80, the second- highest in Breeders' Cup history. For jockey Victor Espinoza, it marked his first Breeders' Cup win. Spain returned to racing at ages four and five. In 2001, she won the La Ca√±ada Stakes and ran second to Unbridled Elaine in the 2001 Breeders' Cup Distaff. As a five-year-old in 2002, at Churchill Downs, Spain won the Louisville Stakes and, while in foal to Storm Cat, won the Fleur de Lis Handicap. She was retired after that race having earned a record $3,540,542. Assessment In the 2000 International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), Spain was given a rating of 122, ranking her equal with Jostle as the second best three-year-old filly in the world (and the best in America), four pounds below the top-rated French filly Egyptband. Breeding record Following the death of Prince Ahmed bin Salman in 2002, Spain was sold to Gerry Dilger of Dromoland Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for $5.3 million at the November 2003 Keeneland Sales while carrying her second foal by Storm Cat, eventually named Calcaria. During the same auction, Gerry Dilger also paid a North American record price for a weanling colt when he paid $2.4 million for Spain's first foal by Storm Cat, named Carpocrates. For her new owner, Spain produced another foal by Storm Cat in 2005. A colt named Plan, he won in Ireland for owner Michael Tabor before being sold to IEAH Stables, for whom he races in the United States. Plan came in second in his only race in the United States, the grade one Secretariat Stakes. In 2006, Spain produced Dreamtheimpossible by Giant's Causeway. The horse raced at age two in 2008 in Ireland and England for owner Susan Magnier. On May 1, 2017 Spain foaled a colt by Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.

The Nazis governed Germany between 1933 and 1945. There has been disagreement over whether Adolf Hitler aimed solely at European expansion and domination, or whether he planned for a long-term global empire.  Continentalists vs. globalists =Moltman and Hillgruber= The argument for what these aims meant in literal terms originates from the 1960s by historians Gunter Moltman and Andreas Hillgruber Hillgruber; A, F. ‚ÄòHitlers Strategie: Politik und Kriegf√ºhrung, 1940-1941‚Äô Bernard & Graefe Verlag f√ºr Wehrwesen, 1965 who, in their respective works, claim that it was Hitler's dream to create ‚ÄòEutopia‚Äô and eventually challenge the United States. This thesis puts these two historians in the ‚ÄòGlobalists‚Äô category, with opposition labelled ‚ÄòContinentalists‚Äô. Evidence for these claims comes from Germany's preparation for war in the years 1933-39 with increased interest in naval building, and Hitler's decision to declare war on the U.S. after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which shows Hitler's determination. The Globalists use this as an argument for how Hitler's ideology was shaped; i.e., the U.S. could only be defeated if Germany conquered Europe and allied with Britain. It is said with general agreement that this viewpoint expressed by Hitler was written with the mindset that the U.S. was of little interest to Germany, and did not pose a threat to her existence. However, noted through speeches and recorded conversations, after 1930, Hitler viewed the United States as a \\"mongrel state\\", incapable of unleashing war and competing economically with Germany due to the extreme effects of the Great Depression. Even in the late 1930s, as Continentalists argue against world conquest, Hitler seems to still disregard the US's power in the world, and believes that only through German-American citizens can the U.S. revive and prosper. This may shed light as to why Hitler made the decision to declare war on the United States after Pearl Harbor, and continued to focus on European expansion in the late 1930s. However, while Hildebrand believes Hitler had a carefully premeditated Stufenplan (step-by- step) for Lebensraum, Hillgruber claims he intended intercontinental conquest afterwards.McDonough, F., (2002), Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement, p.77, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press Likewise, Noakes and PridhamNoakes, J., and Pridham, G., (1997), ‚ÄòNazism 1919-1945. Volume 3: Foreign Policy, War and Racial Extermination‚Äô, p.8, Exeter, University of Exeter Press. believe that taking Mein Kampf and the Zweites Buch together, Hitler had a five-stage plan; rearmament and Rhineland re-militarisation, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland to become German satellites, defeat France or neutralise her through a British alliance, Lebensraum in Russia and finally world domination. GodaTomorrow the World: Hitler, Northwest Africa, and the Path toward America by Norman J. W. Goda, 1999 agrees, believing that his ultimate aim was the defeat and overthrow of the United States, against whose threat he would guarantee the British Empire in return for a free hand to pursue Lebensraum in the East. Hitler had long-term plans for French North Africa and in 1941 begun to prepare a base for a transatlantic attack on the United States. Donald Cameron Watt, who in 1990 believed that Hitler had no long terms plans,Watt, D.C., (1990), ‚ÄòHow War Came‚Äô, p.32, London, Mandarin now agrees with Goda and believes that Hitler refused to make concessions to Spanish and Italian leaders Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini in order to conciliate a defeated France so that such preparations could proceed.http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/460/256.extract =Jochen Thies= There are other arguments for the case of the Globalists; Jochen Thies has been noted to say that plans for world domination can be seen in Hitler's ideology of displaying power. The creation of magnificent buildings and the use of propaganda to demonstrate German strength, along with the message to create a Reich to last a thousand years, clearly show Hitler's aspirations for the future. Although this seems a weak argument to make; clearly these messages are a result of Nazi Ideology intent on creating followers and boosting morale, what stems from this is the idea of ‚Äòglobal character‚Äô in reference to war. There is no doubt that Hitler dreamed about the future of his Homeland, and in preparations for war, must have thought about the consequences of victory over the USSR. His struggle, as he would reference in his book Mein Kampf, would and eventually did take on a global character, as he found his country fighting wars on many fronts across the world. The Globalist mindset for Hitler's foreign policy can be supported by the spiraling events of World War II, along with his second book and the debatable meaning of Lebensraum; although the Continentalists can use Lebensraum as evidence to counter. =Fritz Fischer= Fritz Fischer, a continentalist historian who has done extensive work on German history, claims in his book From Kaiserreich to Third Reich: Elements of Continuity in German History, 1871-1945Fischer; F From Kaiserreich to Third Reich: Elements of Continuity in German History, 1871-1945 Allen & Unwin, 1986 that foreign policy was just a continuous trend from Otto von Bismarck‚Äôs imperialistic policies; that Hitler wanted an empire to protect German interests at a time of economic instability and pressure from competing global empires.  Other views =Martin Broszat= Martin Broszat, a functionalist historian, has been noted many times to point towards an ideological foreign policy fuelled by antisemitism, anti-communism and Lebensraum. He says that Hitler acted towards these three ideals to inspire popularity in his regime and to carry on the amazing transformation he ignited upon coming to power. In relation to foreign policy, this meant the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles and the reuniting of German territories lost after World War I, along with the eradication of Jews and communists around the world. He provides evidence with preparations made in 1938 to take land in the East of Europe, which fits in with the ideology of colonization, economic independency, and the creation of the Third Reich. Broszat offers a Continentalist case in declaring that Hitler was still dreaming of Eutopia when he did not include Poland in his plans before 1939, and focused upon Czechoslovakia and Austria instead; easily attainable territories. Broszat argues against world conquest in this respect, and notes that the escalating ideological radicalism of the Nazis' anti- Semitic views prevented them from being able to launch a truly serious attempt to take over the world. Germany found itself unwillingly in a world war, not a European one. =A. J. P. Taylor= In 1961, A. J. P. Taylor produced a book entitled The Origins of the Second World War,Taylor, A.J.P Origins of the Second World War Simon & Schuster 1961 which paints a completely different picture of how Nazi foreign policy was shaped and executed. Taylor's thesis was that Hitler was not the demoniacal figure of popular imagination but in foreign affairs a normal German leader, and compared the foreign policy of the Weimar Republic to that of Hitler, i.e., wanting the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles and wanting her former territories back but by peaceful means, not aggressive. His argument was that Hitler wished to make Germany the strongest power in Europe but he did not want or plan war. The outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone's part. In addition, Taylor portrayed Hitler as a grasping opportunist with no beliefs other than the pursuit of power and to rid himself of the Jewish question. He argued that Hitler did not possess any sort of long-term plan and his foreign policy was one of drift and seizing chances as they offered themselves. He assigns blame on the harsh restrictions of Versailles, which created animosity amongst Germans, and when Hitler preached of a greater Germany, the public believed in his words and was ready to accept. However, the idea put forward that he was a gifted opportunist who, although Taylor completely rules out long term planning, was shrewd enough to seize upon opportunities when they appeared has a lot of evidence. For example, he used the appeasement policies of Britain and France to deliberately defy them in March 1935 when he announced conscription into the army and creation of the Luftwaffe. He gambled upon the Austrian government to not oppose him when he invaded Vienna in March 1938 after realizing Britain and France would never intervene. He used the opportunity of the September 1938 Munich conference to make Britain and France accept his demands for Lebensraum in Czechoslovakia. He used the breakdown in relations between Britain-France and the Soviet Union to sign the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact to solidify his future actions against Poland and the Netherlands-Belgium. Taylor's point on this debate sparked uproar and widespread rebuttal, but the whole argument on the nature of Nazi foreign policy was created from his work.

In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. The district of Taunton Deane Area covers a population of approximately 100,000 in an area of . It is centred on the town of Taunton, where around 60,000 of the population live and the council are based, and includes surrounding suburbs and villages. There are 38 Grade I listed buildings in Taunton Deane. The oldest buildings are churches built before the end of the 12th century, and the Castle Bow, which has been incorporated into the Castle Hotel in Taunton but was originally a gateway into Taunton Castle. The castle was created between 1107 and 1129, when William Giffard, the Chancellor of King Henry I, fortified the bishop's hall. It was his successor, Henry of Blois, who transformed the manor-house into a castle in 1138, during the Civil War that raged during the reign of his brother, King Stephen. Taunton is also the site of Gray's Almshouses, which dates from 1635, and a building in Fore Street from the 16th century. Most of the Grade I listed buildings in Taunton Deane are Norman or medieval era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. Many of the more recent structures in the list are manor houses such as Cothay Manor and Greenham Barton which were built in Stawley in the 15th century. Poundisford Park and Cothelstone Manor were both built in the 16th century and Hatch Court in 1755. The most recent building included in the list is Hestercombe House, which was rebuilt in 1909.

It is a north-south roadway from Lake Shore Boulevard to Queen Street. Originally laid out in the 19th century as two-lane residential street, its traffic and land use has changed considerably from a suburban/semi-rural street to a main arterial connecting to an expressway. The road is named for Robert Sympson Jameson, former Attorney General of Upper Canada. History Of JamesonRoad In Toronto Jameson Avenue was built in the 1880s as part of the then Village of Parkdale's development, connecting Queen Street to the Lake Ontario waterfront. Parkdale Collegiate Institute, built in 1888 near Queen Street, was one of the first structures to rise alongside the street. Near the foot of the street at Springhurst Avenue and Jameson, the South Parkdale railway station was built in 1879, on the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). After the 1889 annexation of Parkdale into the City of Toronto, the pace of development increased around Jameson Avenue, and the street became lined with single-family dwellings, many of them quite large along the full length of the street down to the waterfront. Several still exist today. The first change in the character of the street came in the 1910s, when the GTR lowered the level of the railway tracks to below that of Jameson, and closed the railway station, replacing it with Sunnyside station to the west. As the City of Toronto grew, and the development of the suburbs to the west, east-west automobile traffic in the area increased. The completion of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) in 1940 meant that Lake Shore Road, and by extension Parkdale, became a major connecting path between downtown Toronto and the highway. King and Queen Streets started to carry large amounts of commuter traffic. When the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto was created in 1953, one of the first projects proposed was a connector highway between the QEW and downtown. This became the Gardiner Expressway. The Gardiner Expressway's right-of-way was laid out just south of the existing GTR rail lines, at the same level. This right-of-way meant the demolition of over 50 homes at the foot of Jameson. An interchange with the expressway at Jameson was also created, which eliminated pedestrian access to the waterfront from the neighbourhood, necessitating a pedestrian bridge. The section of Jameson leading to the lakeshore was removed. The street was not renumbered and the lowest numerical address on the street is 79. The building of the highway changed the street from a residential neighbourhood street to an arterial roadway. The land use changed considerably after that, changing from single-family dwellings to the multi-storey apartment buildings that line Jameson on both sides from Springhurst to Queen Street today. Recently, plans have been made to revamp the area of the demolished neighbourhood, moving the eastbound Lake Shore Boulevard to north of the Gardiner, freeing up space for park uses and enhancing access to the waterfront. As of July 2009, the project still requires approval and funding from Toronto City Council.

The FWS is a partnership worked out between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), other Federal agencies, and labor organizations.  History  Before the FWS, there was no central authority to establish wage equity for Federal trade, craft, and laboring employees. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the former Civil Service Commission to work with Federal agencies and labor organizations to study the different agency systems and combine them into a single wage system that would be sensible and just. President Johnson called for common job-grading standards and wage policies and practices that would ensure interagency equity in wage rates. He established two basic principles for these policies and practices: Wages will be set according to local prevailing rates, and; there will be equal pay for equal work and pay distinctions in keeping with work distinctions. Congress established the FWS by law in 1972. It created a joint labor-management Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) with an independent Chairman. Agencies and labor unions are members of the Committee. FPRAC studies all matters pertaining to prevailing rate determinations and advises the Director of the OPM on appropriate pay policies for FWS employees.  Purpose  The goal of the system is to pay employees according to local prevailing rates. The regular pay plan covers most trade, craft, and laboring employees in the executive branch. The FWS does not cover United States Postal Service employees, legislative branch employees, or employees of private sector contracting firms. Special pay plans cover certain employees in special circumstances. The OPM authorizes special pay plans when unusual labor market conditions seriously handicap agencies in recruiting and retaining qualified employees.  Procedure  OPM prescribes basic policies and procedures to ensure uniform pay-setting. OPM specifies procedures for agencies to design and conduct wage surveys, to construct wage schedules, to grade levels of work, and to administer basic and premium pay for employees. To issue common job-grading standards for major occupations, OPM occupational specialists follow specific steps to develop new standards and to update existing standards. They make full occupational studies, which include onsite visits to interview employees, supervisors, and union representatives. Specialists write standards and ask agencies and unions for comments that are carefully considered and, where appropriate, incorporated into final job-grading standards. Federal agencies are required to apply these standards. OPM defines the geographic boundaries of individual local wage areas and reviews survey job descriptions to ensure that they are accurate and current. In addition, OPM works with agencies and unions to schedule annual local wage surveys in each wage area. Wage adjustments become effective in accordance with what is commonly referred to as the 45-day law. This law states that the Government has 45 working days to put FWS pay adjustments into effect after each wage survey starts. Wage schedules are effective with the first pay period after the 45-day period expires. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) is the lead agency responsible for issuing FWS wage schedules. For each wage area, OPM identifies a \\"lead\\" agency. The \\"lead\\" agency is responsible for conducting wage surveys, analyzing data, and issuing wage schedules under the policies and procedures prescribed by OPM. All agencies in a wage area pay their hourly wage employees according to the wage schedules developed by the lead agency. OPM has identified the Department of Defense as the lead agency for each local wage area. OPM does not conduct local wage surveys.  Labor unions  Labor organizations play an important role in the wage determination process by providing representatives at all levels of the wage determination process. The employee unions having the greatest number of wage employees under exclusive recognition designate two of the five members of a lead agency's national level wage committee. Locally, the union with the most employees under exclusive recognition in a wage area designates one of the three members of each Local Wage Survey Committee. In addition, labor organizations nominate half of the Federal employees who collect wage data from private enterprise employers. A partnership team of one labor data collector and one management data collector visits each surveyed employer. Under the FWS, each employer bases pay on what private industry is paying for comparable levels of work in a given local wage area. Employees are paid the full prevailing rate at step 2 of each grade level. Step 1, the lowest step in the FWS, is 4 percent below the prevailing rate of pay. Steps 3, 4, & 5, are four, eight, & 12 percent above the prevailing rate of pay, respectively.  Other systems  The General Schedule (GS) is a separate pay system covering most white-collar civilian Federal employees. Surveys of non-Federal employers, including State and local governments, determine the pay for GS employees. There are a number of other differences between the GS and FWS in terms of occupational coverage, geographic coverage, pay ranges, and pay adjustment cycles.

The concert took place on 18 September 1976 in Hyde Park, London. It was part of a brief summer tour of the UK by the band; they also played in Edinburgh and Cardiff on this tour. The Hyde Park gig was a free concert, which drew in a crowd of over 150,000, which was one of the largest audiences for any concert in London. The free concert was organised by Richard Branson, an entrepreneur at the time. There is more than one audio source of this concert as well as a video. According to Roger Taylor, the drummer of Queen, the complete show was supposed to be shown on TV in early 1977 but was never aired. Since then, the footage has leaked out to collectors, though in terrible quality. Over the years, some of the footage has been shown in various documentaries and there are rumors of a future official release.

It is located on the western side of Portland, where it lies west of the villages Weston and Easton. The quarry is operated by Albion Stone and became the site of the first Portland Stone mine. In October 2002 the firm successfully initiated Portland's first ever underground mining operation, which was a precursor to Jordans Mine, which would start in 2008.http://www.dorsetgeologistsassociation.com/Portland- Stone/Portland_Stone_Document_-_7_June_12.pdf It has also been the selected site for the planned Mass Extinction Memorial Observatory.

The quarry has been in operation since the late 1700s, when it was made up of various small individual family run quarries.http://www.nigelcopsey.com/reports/training/training_portland_stone.pdf In 1979 Albion Stone secured the lease for the quarry from the Crown Estate. From this time the quarry gradually extended south towards the Weston Estate.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680715/ Bowers had long become a deep quarry and, as a result of an 8-metre stand-off of untouched ground alongside the boundary and the gentle slope of up to 15 metres of overburden above the Portland Stone beds, a significant quantity of dimension stone was to be potentially wasted alongside the boundary. In 1998 the firm received planning permission for the first Portland Stone trial mine at Bowers Quarry. As an experiment, the mining technique was to reduce the environmental impact of the stone industry on Portland.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680715/ The Bowers Mine trials began in 2002, and were completed in 2005.http://www.albionstone.com/about-us/our-history/ In the spring of 2006 the High Wall extraction in Bowers Quarry commenced.http://www.albionstone.com/about-us/our-history/ The extraction from Bowers Quarry today is completely underground through mining. Bowers is largely quarried for Bowers Roach, Whitbed and Basebed.http://www.albionstone.com/portland-stone/beds/bowers-roach In 2005 Albion Stone revealed a new mining plan for the Jordans Quarry, which started in 2008 and was also a success.http://www.dorsetgeologistsassociation.com/Portland- Stone/Portland_Stone_Document_-_7_June_12.pdf In 2013, Dorset County Council approved a new planning application, allowing Albion Stone to extend the existing mine under the playing fields to the south. The ground is now on a long lease from the county to Albion Stone and new portals have been dug into the faces of Bowers Quarry to access the extended area. These reserves of Portland stone are estimated to last 20‚Äì30 years. As part of the application, a phased restoration plan has been agreed covering the entire quarry.http://webapps.westdorset- dc.gov.uk/PlanningApps/Pages/Planning.aspx?App=WP/13/00449/DCC In 2006 the MEMO project was established by Sebastian Brooke.

The British Rabbit Council (BRC) recognises six varieties: Argent√© Bleu, Argent√© Brun, Argent√© Cr√®me, Argent√© de Champagne, Argent√© Noir, and Argent√© St Hubert. The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) recognises the Champagne d'Argent and the Cr√®me d'Argent. A rare variety, the Argent√© Clair, is not currently recognised by either the BRC or ARBA. The names of the Argent√© breeds (Brun, Noir, etc.) refer not to the top-colour (which is always silver), but rather to the lower portions of the hair shaft. At birth, Argent√©s are of a solid color, with adult colouring beginning to show as early as six weeks and as late as four months of age. Argent√© rabbits are small and neat with well-developed hind quarters and slightly arched backs. Strong traits of being cobby or racy are undesirable in Argent√©s. With broad heads and straight front legs, Argent√©s are short and fine in bone. Due to their good nature, they are known as excellent pets.  Argent√© Bleu The Argent√© Bleu has erect ears that are short, rounded, and proportionate in breadth. Bleus weigh approximately and their coats, which lie close to their bodies, are very dense, glossy, and silky. The undercolour of the Argent√© Bleu is lavender blue. In shows, it is desirable for the colour to be even and moderately interspersed with longer dark blue hairs to give a distinct bluish effect when viewed from a distance. Eyes are bold and blue, and toenails are coloured. In rabbit shows, the following are considered faults in the Argent√© Bleu: dark or too long ears, too dark muzzle, and/or washy undercolour. Creamy or yellow tint (especially around the neck and cheeks), a large paunch, a bony or angular frame, or fur that is too harsh, thin, wooly, or short is frowned upon. Dewlaps in either sex are considered a serious fault. White-topped or very dark exhibits are discouraged. White toenails are a minor fault. Argent√© Brun The Argent√© Brun is recognised by the BRC [\\"Argente Brun (UK)\\"] and by ARBA [\\"Argente Brun (US)\\"]. Their differences are noted below. The Argent√© Brun (UK) weighs approximately . The BRC standard states: \\"Undercolour as deep brown as possible, body colour brownish-white, the whole evenly and moderately interspersed with longer dark brown hairs to give a distinct brownish effect when viewed from a distance.\\" The coat is described as \\"Very dense, glossy, silky and lying close to the body. Desired length between .\\" The Argente Brun (UK) originated in England. The Argent√© Brun (US) may be a maximum of . The ARBA standard states: \\"Surface color is to be an even silvered or frosted chocolate brown throughout. While evenness is stressed, slightly darker muzzle butterfly, ears and feet are desirable. Longer, dark brown guard hairs are to be evenly interspersed over the entire pelt. The under color is to be a rich chocolate ideally carried right to the skin.\\" The Argente Brun (US) originated in Canada. Argent√© Clair The Argent√© Clair, called Light Groot Silver in Germany, is a rare breed that is not currently recognised by the BRC or ARBA. It is similar in appearance to the Champagne d'Argent, but heavily silvered and with recessive dilute blue as an undercoat (instead of black). Argent√© Cr√®me (UK) The breed that is recognised by the BRC as the Argent√© Cr√®me is similar to the breed that is recognised by ARBA as the Cr√®me d'Argent The Argent√© Cr√®me (much smaller than the Cr√®me d'Argent) weighs approximately and, like the Bleus and Bruns, has a very dense, glossy, silky coat that lies close to the body. Argent√© Cr√®mes have an orange undercolour that go down to the skin and their outer color is a silver giving them a creamy complection. In shows, it is desirable for the whole body to be evenly and moderately interspersed with longer orange hairs to give a distinct creamy effect when viewed from a distance. A white underbelly is permissible but a coloured underbelly is encouraged. Their eyes are bold and dark brown, and their toenails should be horn coloured. In shows, Cr√®mes follow the same guidelines for faults as Bleus and Bruns with the addition of: light soiling of the feet, ears and genital organs, bare pads, fur slightly soiled or matted, and/or long toe nails. Argent√© de Champagne (UK) An Argent√© de Champagne rabbit The breed that is recognised by the BRC as the Argent√© de Champagne is similar to the breed that is recognised by ARBA as the Champagne d'Argent. The Argent√© de Champagne weighs . Its undercolour is described as dark slate blue, with a bluish white body. It is preferred that they have long jet black hairs interspersed in their fur to create a silvery tone when viewed from a distance. It can also be all black. In show judging, the following are considered faults: dark ears, creamy or yellow tint, especially noticeable around the neck and cheeks. A large paunch, or a bony or angular frame are discouraged. Fur should not be harsh, thin, wooly or too short. Dewlaps in either sex are a serious fault. White topped or too dark exhibits are discouraged. White toe-nails are a minor fault. The Argent√© de Champagne is one of the oldest known rabbit breeds. At that time known as the French Silver for its silvery coat, it was once prized for its pelt in spite of the fact that it was a common breed. Kits are born pure black and begin turning silver gray at about 3 weeks. By 6 months old they are typically a shade of silver grey. Argent√© Noir The Argent√© Noir weighs approximately . Its coat is grayish white, with deep slate blue undertones to create a silvery effect from a distance. The eyes are a distinctive bold brown. In show judging, the following are considered faults: dark or too long ears, too dark muzzle, or washy undercolour. Creamy or yellow tint is discouraged, most noticeably around the neck and cheeks. A large paunch or bony or angular frame are discouraged. Fur should not be harsh, thin, wooly or too short. Dewlaps in either sex are a serious fault. White topped or too dark exhibits are discouraged. White toenails are a minor fault. Argent√© St Hubert Argent√© Saint Hubert The Argent√© St Hubert weighs approximately . Its under colour is dark blue at the base with an orange intermediate band with narrow top chestnut band. Body colour is creamy white interspersed with black guard hairs to give a creamy chestnut shade. Champagne d'Argent (US) The breed that is recognised by ARBA as the Champagne d'Argent is similar to the breed that is recognised by the BRC as the Argent√© de Champagne. The Champagne d'Argent weighs . Color is described thus: \\"The surface color should be as near the color of skimmed milk, old silver, or light ultramarine (meaning washed out blue) as is possible. Fur over entire body should carry a liberal sprinkling of longer black guard hairs. It was to have a rich sheen and surface color that was uniform over the usable pelt, with no tinge of brassiness or foreign color.\\" Cr√®me d'Argent (US) The breed that is recognised by ARBA as the Cr√®me d'Argent is similar to the breed that is recognised by the BRC as the Argent√© Cr√®me. The Cr√®me d'Argent (much larger than the Argent√© Cr√®me) weighs . Its coat is \\"creamy-white in color with an orange cast carried throughout the fur of the body. The undercoat is bright orange and this color carries to the skin. The entire coat is interspersed with orange guard hairs.\\" The Cr√®me d'Argent's origins are in France in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, where its unusual fur was quite popular. In the 1920s and 1930s, some specimens were imported to the United States from France, Germany and England. (The first rabbits of the breed were brought to the US in 1924 or shortly before.) Although the breed struggled at first, its lovely coloration appealed to American fanciers. Today, the Cr√®me d'Argent is a rare breed. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, an organization devoted to breed preservation, lists the Cr√®me d'Argent on its \\"Watch\\" list. At the time of this writing, fewer than 100 Cr√®me d'Argents are being registered each year in the United States. Only 43 specimens were shown at the 2006 ARBA National Convention & Show.

The 2020 EuroSTAR Software Testing Conference will take place online November 17 to November 19, 2020. History of EuroSTAR Software Testing The first EuroSTAR conference took place in London in October 1993 as a sister conference of (US-based) STAR Conferences organised by William C. Hetzel and Gelperin in conjunction with the British Computer Society. EuroSTAR stands for European Software Testing Analysis & Review. EuroSTAR is the longest running and largest European software testing and quality assurance conference that takes place in a different European city each year. Cities visited so far include London (1993, 1995) Brussels (1994, 1997) Amsterdam (1996, 2003, 2012), Edinburgh (1997, 2002), Munich (1998), Barcelona (1999), Copenhagen (2000, 2005, 2010, 2017), Manchester (2006, 2011), Stockholm (2001, 2007, 2009), Cologne (2004), The Hague (2008, 2018), Dublin (2014), Maastricht (2015), and Prague (2019). The annual conference has been the origin of many notable milestones in the history of software testing including the introduction of the W-Model by Paul Herzlich in 1993, the foundation of Dutch Special Interest Group in Software Testing (SIGIST) TestNet at EuroSTAR 1996 and the foundation of the Test Lab (2009) which has since become a focal point at many international conferences on software testing. Proceedings at EuroSTAR have been cited in many publications on software testing and the conference is regularly featured on best international software testing conference lists and IT journals. EuroSTAR European Testing Excellence Award  The EuroSTAR European Testing Excellence Award has been awarded at the annual EuroSTAR Conference since 1998. The award seeks to recognise significant contributions to the field of software testing in Europe. Notable past winners of the European Testing Excellence Award include Martin Pol, Dorothy Graham, Tim Koomen, Geoff Thompson and Gerald Weinberg.

The escaping air tends to reduce the oral air pressure and impede the proper production of the consonant. Secondary effects sometimes noted with nasal emission are the development of improper compensatory pronunciation habits, including using a very soft voice that uses less breath pressure. Nasal emission can be detected by a number of simple techniques, such as looking for the fogging of a mirror held under the naresKummer, A. W. (2006, Feb. 7).

In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. The district of West Somerset covers a largely rural area, with a population, according to the 2011 census, of 35,300 in an area of . The largest centres of population are the coastal towns of Minehead and Watchet. The council's administrative headquarters are in the village of Williton. There are 33 Grade I listed buildings in West Somerset. The oldest is either Culbone Church, one of the smallest churches in England, and pre-Norman in origin, or Tarr Steps, which may originate in the Bronze Age, although other sources date them from around 1400. Dunster has the greatest concentration of Grade I listed buildings, including Dunster Castle, which was built in 1617 on a site which had supported a castle for the previous 600 years; the Yarn Market, which was built in 1609; Gallox Bridge, which dates from the 15th century and the Priory Church of St George which is predominately from the 15th century but includes part of the earlier church on the same site. Other sites include manor houses such as the medieval buildings at Nettlecombe Court and Orchard Wyndham. Somerset has many religious structures, most of which are from the Norman or medieval eras. Some of the churches are part of the Somerset towers, a collection mostly spireless Gothic church towers.

He was the first Warden, (since renamed Ranger), for the Lake District National Park, and commonly detailed life in the lake district in his books. Life and Works Wyatt was born in Ashton-under-Lyne in 1925, son of a cotton mill Overlooker. He spent his early years living in the area and began his working life as a copy boy for a Manchester-based newspaper. His first experience in the Lakelands was during his years in the 3rd Ashton Scout Group, on a camping trip above Windermere. He later said, \\"Somehow I felt as if I belonged. It was Overwhelming. It was almost as if I had returned home after a long absence\\".Smith, Roly:\\"John Wyatt, Lakeland ranger at home in the country but not on committees , \\"The Guardian\\", 5/15/2006 He left school at the age of 15 and went to work as a copy boy in the Manchester Office of the Daily Telegraph. During World War II, Wyatt joined the Royal Navy where he worked as a radio operator. Finally returning to his work after the war, Wyatt decided to move to the countryside and he became a forestry worker and campsite warden at Great Tower, Windermere. Wyatt became the park ranger in the Lake District national park in 1961, as the park introduced new regulations to cope with increasing tourism in the area. This made him the first Ranger for the park, having to patrol practically all of the Lakeland's on his own for around two years. Wyatt was set to work monitoring footpaths, checking up on local farmers and points of interest and delivering lectures on the locality. However, later in 1963 the Lakes hired another ranger to help, with Wyatt being assigned to the southern parts of the park. Later still, in the 1970s, the park hired more rangers and so, in 1973, he was declared chief ranger, where his work became more and more administrative.\\"Mr.J.
