Cry34/35Ab1 binary toxins bind to the insect's brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of cells in the epithelial lining of midgut, where they form pores; this leads to necrosis and, eventually, the insect's death. The Cry35Ab1 (45 kDa) protein does not convey specificity in the absence of Cry34Ab1, indicating that the smaller 14 kDa Cry34Ab1 protein is critical for BBMV binding and recruitment of Cry35Ab1 to induce insecticidal effect. Cry34Ab1 is unrelated to Bt delta-endotoxins. It is an aegerolysin () composed of two beta sheets in a beta-sandwich structure; the total protein is composed of 117 amino acid residues and contains a hydrophobic core.

Turner (born February 14, 1944) is a professor of international law and national security law at the University of Virginia and the co-founder of its Center for National Security Law. He has testified before the United States Congress numerous times, served as a legal advisor to the Departments of State and Defense and as a White House Counsel during the Reagan administration, published articles in national newspapers, been interviewed on national television programs and been cited often by other legal scholars on national security law, international law and the separation of powers doctrine.  Education  Turner earned his BA in Government with honors from Indiana University in 1968. While attending the university, he became chairman of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists Conservative League. Later, he became the National Research Director for Student Committee for Victory in Vietnam and engaged in debates with national anti-war protestors and college professors who opposed the war. As National Research Director, he produced a series of pamphlets called Vietnam Cliches that documented facts about the war that were in opposition to antiwar views. He undertook graduate work in history and political science at Stanford University in 1972 and 1973 while in the employ of the Hoover Institution and resumed his graduate studies enrolling in Government and Foreign Affairs coursework in 1979-1981 while attending law school at the University of Virginia, where he earned his J.D degree. He earned a Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) degree from UVA in 1996.  Career  In 1968, Turner served briefly as a correspondent in Vietnam for the Indianapolis News. He then was commissioned as a Captain in the US Army through the ROTC program and assigned to the intelligence services. He served in Vietnam from 1968 through 1971, primarily assigned to MACV on detail to the US Embassy as Assistant Special Projects Officer, North Vietnam/Viet Cong Affairs Division. One of his duties was interviewing senior communist defectors and POWs. In that position, he accumulated first-hand knowledge of Vietnamese communism from those he interviewed, an experience that led to his book, Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development.* Another of his duties was briefing US and foreign media. In his capacity as Special Projects Officer, he also authored a top secret monograph on Viet Cong assassination policy. In 1971 he became a Research Assistant/Associate at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, where \\"he contributed ten chapters on communist movements in Southeast Asia to the Yearbook on International Communist Affairs (1972).\\" While at Stanford, he attended graduate courses in History and Political Science. In 1972 he became a Public Affairs Fellow. He spent his first year researching at Stanford and completing his book on Vietnamese Communism and his second year on Capitol Hill. During that period, he also served as Associate Editor (Asia and Pacific) for the Yearbook on International Communist Affairs (1973-1974). When his fellowship was complete, Turner became Special Assistant and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator Robert P. Griffin of Michigan for five years. He served as Senator Griffin's national security advisor and was responsible for Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence issues. While there, he helpded draft the language that created the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. In April 1981, Turner co-founded the Center for National Security Law with John Norton Moore. It was \\"the first organization focused expressly on national security law in the nation, and probably in the world.\\" That same year he took a leave of absence to become the Special Assistant to the UnderSecretary of Defense for Policy as well as Counsel to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board, where he served for two years. Then he served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative and Governmental Affairs for the United States Department of State until 1985. The following year, Turner became the first President and CEO of the United States Institute of Peace which was established by Congress in 1984, holding the position from 1986 to 1987. Two years later, he became the Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security. He held the post until 1992. He also served as editor of the ABA National Security Law Report. in 1991, Turner co-edited and published National Security Law and Policy, now in its third edition. At the time of its creation, the field of national security law did not exist as a separate discipline in the legal profession. Turner went on to become a three-term chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security. In 1994, he received a one-year appointment to the US Naval War College and became the Charles H. Stockton Professor of International Law, \\"one of [the] oldest and most prestigious academic chairs\\" at the college. That same year, he was described, in a Michigan Law Review article, as (one of the) \\"two most distinguished and careful commentators\\" in the area of the law and the Vietnam War. In 2000, Turner chaired an academic study investigating the paternity of Sally Hemings children. The year-long research project concluded that the most likely father of Hemings' children was the mentally-challenged younger brother of Thomas Jefferson, Randolph Jefferson. A book detailing the commission's findings was published in 2011. In his 2012 book \\"Master of the Mountain\\", Henry Wiencek described Turner as ‚ÄúJefferson‚Äôs chief scholarly defender‚Äù. Turner is often consulted on national security matters by news reporters and is a contributor to the Wall Street Journal on several issues; national security, surveillance laws, the Hemings controversy and the Vietnam War. He is a contributor to the Washington Post and USA Today as well. He has also spent a lifetime speaking and writing about the Vietnam war and has, for many years, taught graduate and undergraduate seminars on the Vietnam War at UVA. He has testified before \\"more than a dozen\\" committees in the House and Senate on national security matters, international law and the separation of powers doctrine, as well as other issues, and his books and articles have been cited hundreds of times by other legal scholars and are used in courses at Yale and other law schools.

Its reservoir stores around 20 million cubic metres and is fed by the River Olef.  Description  The Olef Dam was built between 1954 and 1959 for two purposes: to protect the surrounding municipalities from floods; and to supply drinking water. In 1965 the valley was completely filled with water for the first time and the dam officially opened. There were two subsequent construction phases to reinforce it: 1962‚Äì1965 and 1982‚Äì1986. The dam is made of concrete and is of the buttress type and is unique in Germany.There is only one other buttress dam in Germany, the Linach Dam, but it is a subgroup of the Gew√∂lbereihenstaumauer type. Other uses of the dam are to raise low water levels, industrial water processing and hydropower generation. The power station capacity is 3 MW, its annual energy production is 2.6 GWh. The storage power station is operated by RWE Innogy. The dam belongs to the Wasserverband Eifel-Rur. Because of its proximity to the Belgian border, its western half is within the safety template of the Elsenborn Training Area in the Belgian municipality of B√ºtgenbach. The dam had to be reinforced twice because large variations in temperature and shrinkage of the concrete produced greater internal stresses than were foreseen, leading to cracks. The initially open downstream side was sealed in order to limit the temperature variations. The shortest circular route around the reservoir is 13 km long. It runs along the lakeshore and is open to cyclists. Its northern side is largely tarmacked. In early April 2007 the downstream face of the dam was decorated by artist, Klaus Dauven, with high pressure cleaners as part of Project Wildwechsel. It portrays forest and river animals from the area.

The song aired only once in the USSR in the program \\"The Music Kiosk\\", because it was banned afterwards the severely critical article by Sergey Obraztsov in the newspaper \\"Soviet Culture\\". After 28 years, in 2012, \\"Night\\" was first recorded by Noskov on his solo album Bez nazvaniya.

By early 1984, Tukhmanov, tired of the group's constant bans and the need to overcome them, completely took off the already ephemeral duties of a producer and group leader, and so the group practically disbanded. The key musician, the soloist of \\"Moscow\\", Nikolai Noskov, for whom Tukhmanov wrote almost all the songs of the group, and who at that time already began to work in the ensemble \\"Singing Hearts\\", he offered to start a solo career and for this purpose wrote the first song \\"Night\\" based on fragments of the unfinished poem of Vladimir Mayakovsky written around the time of his death, 1930 (started in 1928). Sergey Obraztsov In 1984, the song was recorded in Tukhmanov's studio and aired on the TV show \\"The Music Kiosk\\". The show was seen by Sergey Obraztsov, one of the major officially recognized theater figures of the USSR, a puppeteer who wrote a devastating article on the song in the newspaper \\"Soviet Culture\\". At the conclusion of his article, Obraztsov wrote: \\"I hope that this song will sound no more\\", after which \\"Night\\" was completely banned. Tukhmanov, after almost thirty years, recalled this: \\"An item appeared in the newspaper, in which it was written: how can you take such holy verses and make a pop song out of them?\\" Noskov found out some things regarding the prohibition, although no one even contacted him regarding this incident: \\"Tukhmanov said that the authorities do not like my vocal timbre\\". For Nikolai Noskov, the ban on the song became a landmark; not only the song was banned, but also him: \\"It seemed to me that if a composer like Tukhmanov made a song for Mayakovsky's verses, then perhaps it would not attract the attention of Soviet censorship. But I was wrong, the song became forbidden, like the one who performed it ...\\" During the perestroika and after the collapse of the USSR, the ban on the song was lifted by itself, but Nikolai Noskov, who was first employed in the Gorky Park group, and then with his own songs in the solo career, performed \\"Night\\" rarely. Later the song returned to his repertoire, and in 2012, 28 years after the appearance of the song, Noskov first recorded it on his solo album Bez nazvaniya. In 2013, \\"Night\\" was performed by Nikolai Noskov in the television episode of \\"The Property of the Republic\\" entirely dedicated to the songs of David Tukhmanov, among eleven other Tukhmanov songs.

It flew in 1928 but an old and unreliable engine prevented its development. Design and development Light aircraft design was slow to start in Poland but from 1924 the Airborne and Antigas Defence League, generally known by their Polish acronym L.O.P.P., began to fund amateur builders. One of the first recipients was Jozef Medwecki, an aircraft designer with the Samolot company, who built the short-lived Medwecki HL 2. Michael Offierski, a colleague of his in the Samolot design office, also obtained L.O.P.P. funding and built the O.2; like the HL 2 it was a low power two-seater but had in contrast a low wing. Like Medewecki, Offierski built it in Samolot's factory in his spare time. He began in late 1927 after the demise of the ML 2, using its troublesome air-cooled Anzani engine. The O.2 had a two part, rectangular plan wing built around two spars and ply covered. The airfoil was aerodynamically semi-thick and the thickness was constant over the span. Each part was mounted on a lower fuselage longeron with light dihedral and braced to the upper longerons with pairs of parallel wooden struts to the spars. Ailerons filled over half the trailing edges. Behind the engine the fuselage structure had a rectangular section. Apart from rounded decking, the ply covering was flat. There were two open cockpits in tandem, one between the wing bracing struts and the other just ahead of the trailing edge. The O.2 was provided with dual controls, with the instruments in the front cockpit visible from the rear. Fuel tanks were also in the fuselage. The O.2's empennage was conventional. Its strut braced tailplane and separated, broad chord elevators were rectangular in plan and the vertical tail was straight-edged but tapered, with the rudder working between the elevators. Its fixed landing gear was also standard for the time, its mainwheels on a single axle with rubber cord shock absorbers, supported on V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. It was intended that the O.2 should compete in the Second National Lightplane Contest in late October 1928. The exact date of its first flight is unknown, though it managed a few flights in September and October. Its unreliable Anzani engine frustrated the O.2's development and prevented its participation in the Contest, after which it was abandoned.

Historical context Eliza Potter‚Äôs narrative was published in 1859 prior to the Civil War. She writes her narrative as a free black woman of mixed race during the antebellum era who travels throughout the United States and Europe. Summary =The Preface: \\"The Author's Appeal\\"= In Eliza Potter‚Äôs preface to her narrative, Potter states the reason for writing her book: ‚Äú[I]nfluenced by the earnest persuasions of may ladies and gentlemen, I have at last concluded that I might just as well note down a few of my experiences for their amusement as not.‚Äù Potter tells her audience that the purpose of her writing is to give her audience the gossip that they had requested from her. Also in her preface, Potter compares the importance of her profession as a hairdresser to that of a physician or clergyman: ‚ÄúBut no where do hearts betray themselves more unguardedly than in the private boudoir . . . Why, then, should not the hair- dresser write, as well as the physician and clergyman.\\" Potter explains that her work as a hairdresser is equally as valuable to other vocations. =Chapter One: \\"My Debut\\"= Potter begins her chapter by explaining the nature of her writing style. She calls this disorganized way of writing ‚Äúa little harum scarum.‚Äù She then begins her story by saying that she grew up in New York and worked in service of people, but always desired to travel. In the chapter, she details her travels to various cities in Canada, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, Washington City, and Paris. During this time, Potter states that she worked as a hairdresser to several different ladies. Also within the chapter, Potter comments on her ideas of lady hood and the slave trade. =Chapter Two: \\"England\\"= In ‚ÄúEngland,‚Äù Potter reveals the way she is treated as a free black woman during the antebellum era in various parts of the world. She travels with the S. family in this chapter and records her experiences. Potter also notes the differences between how servants are treated in Europe versus America. =Chapter Three: \\"America\\"= At the beginning of the chapter, Potter tells how she lived with a family in Cincinnati. Desiring to travel again, Potter leaves for Memphis and accounts how salves are treated there. She then goes to New Orleans but does not leave the ship. Later in the chapter, Potter tells about some of the women whose hair she dresses and gossip of a woman whose husband left her. =Chapter Four: \\"Saratoga\\"= Eliza Potter details her experiences at the United States Hotel. She tells about the ballroom, describes ladylike attire, and depicts fashion in the U.S. In this chapter, Potter discloses several stories of gossip but explains that she ‚Äúmerely write[s] them out for the amusement of those who may wish to indulge themselves in a little gossip.‚Äù She also mentions how chambermaids are treated. Later, she gives accounts of marriages and deaths in high life. =Chapter Five: \\"Leaving Saratoga - Burning of the Baggage Car - Visit to New York\\"= Potter starts her chapter by saying that she has returned to Albany, but she first wants to tell a story of when she left and the baggage cart caught flame. She attempts to retrieve her clothing and describes her amusement when gentlemen questioned her ability to have an expensive wardrobe. After this event, Potter depicts various mansions in New York. =Chapter Six: \\"New Port - The Maid's Story\\"= Potter states that she is now going to go back in time to when she worked at Saratoga to tell a story. In the chapter, Potter describes her own dress at a ball in comparison to other white ladies in high life. She states that her ‚Äúown dress was the brightest crimson that could be found.‚Äù Afterwards, she retells a story that a maid told her about how a woman in high life cheated on her husband. =Chapter Seven: \\"Minnie\\"= Potter reminisces on her experience working for a family in Kentucky and the story of one of their daughters Minnie. A gentlemen by the name of Noble fall in love with Minnie, but Potter says, ‚ÄúMinnie, young as she was, already loved another.‚Äù Minnie marries Noble to the delight of her mother. However, Minnie proves to be unhappy since Noble attempts to control her. Potter then explains how Minnie leaves Noble. =Chapter Eight: \\"Natchez - New Orleans\\"= In ‚ÄúNatchez ‚Äì New Orleans‚Äù, Potter explains how women use her work as a hairdresser to make themselves beautiful despite in reality being ugly. She also provides an account of race relations and how a woman of color proved to be the ‚Äúmost tyrannical, overbearing, cruel task-mistress that ever existed.‚Äù Additionally, Potter discloses the story of when she critiques a woman in high life. When a lady and man conversed in front of her in French to conceal their conversation, Potter chastises the woman. She closes her chapter by describing the unjust treatment of slaves. =Chapter Nine: \\"Cincinnati\\"= Potter begins her chapter by giving a description of her profession. She then shifts her focus to explain how parties are conducted in France and England (121). Potter then explains her time in servitude to Mr. L. Potter believes Mr. L is a true gentleman who has done numerous good deeds under her observation. Potter also expounds upon her views of slavery and abolitionists. Later in the chapter, Potter gives her explanation of what constitutes a lady. She closes her narrative by giving her opinion to a lady at the opera. Critical analysis *In Francis Smith Foster‚Äôs book, Written by Herself: Literary Production by African American Women 1746-1892, she discusses how African American women ‚Äúconsciously revised [literary] tradition to more accurately conform to their truths and their visions. . . . And they were testing ways in which the English language and its literature might better serve them as African American women writers.‚Äù *Rnyetta Davis argues that Potter‚Äôs ‚Äúadeptness at pointing out white women‚Äôs performances shows not only her ability to spot frauds, but also illustrates her refusal to pass for something she is not. Unlike the fraudulent women she encounters, Potter does not wear false, fake or borrowed jewelry, or shoes and clothing that are too small.‚Äù *Xiomara Santamarina in her book Belabored Professions states that by maintaining distance, Potter receives her white audience‚Äôs trust and seemingly remains in her societal designated sphere: ‚ÄúHaving established her independence from her clients as wage laborer appears to have worked to Potter‚Äôs advantage, since it could be viewed as adhering to racial and class hierarchies.‚Äù *Lisa Ze Winters argues that New Orleans, a state where slavery was legal, would cause Potter to share her beliefs: ‚ÄúA city as infamous for the size of its slave market . . . could not function merely as a discursive site for Potter. . . . Indeed, Potter consistently reminds her readers of the terror faced by any black woman, slave or free, moving across a U.S. landscape.‚Äù References 1859 books American memoirs Hairdressers ","title":"A Hairdresser's Experience in High Life"},{"id":"55915250","text":"The Cessna 408 SkyCourier is an American twin-turboprop, high-wing, utility aircraft under development by Textron Aviation.

After earning an M.A. from the University of Toronto, Siegler attended Brandeis University, where he studied cinema and documentary film production and received an M.F.A. in 1973. He began writing and producing independent documentary films including \\"With Intent to Harm\\" and \\"Patriotism, Inc,\\" and in 1976 went to work at WKYC-TV, the NBC-owned station in Cleveland, Ohio. He produced seven documentaries there, including the Emmy-award winning \\"They Shall Take up Serpents.\\" He moved to Los Angeles in 1978 to attend the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies. Career In 1978 Brandon Tartikoff hired Siegler as a current program executive at NBC Television network. The two remained friends until Tartikoff's death in 1997, a relationship described in Tartikoff's 1992 autobiography, The Last Great Ride.The Last Great Ride, Brandon Tartikoff, Random House, 1992 Siegler moved to CBS in 1980, first as vice president of drama development at CBS television network (1980)Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jun 17,1980, p. 5: \\"Siegler VP CBS Drama\\"Variety, April 9, 1980, \\"Siegler Upped to CBS Drama VP\\" and then as vice president of comedy, where he developed programs such as Simon and Simon, Falcon Crest, and Magnum, P.I. Following his tenure at CBS he became senior vice president of Warner Bros television, and there developed series such as Head of the Class, Growing Pains, V, and Night Court. He left Warner Bros in 1986 to found the television studio of the new TriStar Pictures,Variety, March 3, 1986, p. 1: \\"Siegler Named President of New TriStar Pictures TV Studio\\"Variety, June 4, 1986, p. 1: \\"TriStar TV Off to a Fast Start\\"Variety, Feb 13, 1989, p. 1: \\"$37M Plus in TV Production for TriStar TV\\" a venture partially owned by Coca-Cola and HBO. Within a year TriStar merged with the larger and older Columbia Pictures Television (now called Sony Pictures Television) and Siegler became president of the merged entity. That studio was responsible for television series, movies, soap operas and mini-series, including Married... With Children and The Young and the Restless. In 1993 Siegler left Columbia to invest time and money in \\"new media\\" ventures. He joined the boards of Tsunami Media (with CEO Ed Heinbockel and board member Steve Bannon), an early online game company, and American Cybercast, the first online entertainment company to produce episodic, advertiser-supported series (\\"The Spot\\", \\"The Pyramid\\") for the internet. He partnered with Jim Clark, the computer scientist who had previously founded Silicon Graphics in 1981, in an interactive video game television channel to be produced in conjunction with Nintendo, but the project never went beyond the planning stage.Hollywood Reporter, June 1, 2000, p 4 During this time Clark, who had begun pondering the World Wide Web and the commercial possibilities of the internet, invited University of Illinois graduate student Marc Andreessen to his home in Atherton, California, in late 1993 to explain the internet and Andreessen's innovative navigator (\\"a yellow pages for the internet\\") that he called a browser. The University of Illinois internet navigation project had been called Mosaic, and that was the name adopted by Clark for its commercial application, Mosaic Communications. Siegler was a seed investor in that company, shortly renamed Netscape Communications. Netscape was sold to AOL in 2002 for $4.2B.The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story, Michael Lewis, Norton, 1999 Other investments followed, including Savage Beast Technologies, later renamed Pandora Music, where Siegler served as board Chairman from 1998-2001. In 2002 Siegler joined Strauss Zelnick as a partner in ZelnickMedia, a private equity firm focused on the media and communications companies which employed revenue models different from those being employed by broadcast television. ZelnickMedia currently has a controlling interest in Take Two Media, the company behind the \\"Grand Theft Auto\\" online game series.Variety, April 23, 2002, p 6 Siegler ended his association with ZelnickMedia in 2009 and formed Mediasiegler, LLC as a vehicle for his continued media investing. Personal life In 1990 Siegler competed on the United States team in the Ninth Annual World Championships of Elephant Polo, held at an airstrip near Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal. The event was chronicled in Mad Dogs and Pachyderms in the December 16, 1991 issue of Sports Illustrated.Sports Illustrated Dec 16, 1991. p140. \\"Mad Dogs and Pachyderms\\" Siegler has been married three times and has had a son and a daughter. His daughter died in 2010 at the age of 13. He currently serves on two boards, The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and The Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan investigative journalism organization in Washington, DC.

The parish is a member of the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester.  History  The official founding date is 1807, when a piece of land was given to the Episcopal community in Clifton Springs by Mr. John Shekel. A small, wooden structure was built in 1808, which became the First Episcopal Church of Clifton Springs. The building served as the worship home for the Episcopal community until around 1820, when, due to dwindling numbers, the congregation sold the building to the local Methodist community. The Episcopal community gathered to worship in one another's homes until 1841, when the group grew too large, and a new building project was begun. The Second Episcopal Church of Clifton Springs was only in use for around 40 years, though, because in 1967, the current rector suggested a new edifice be built. In 1879, the cornerstone was laid for the current St. John's structure. The building, made of Medina sandstone (from Medina, New York), was completed in 1883 and consecrated in 1884. In 2018, St. John's was inducted into the Medina Sandstone Hall of Fame, which judges structures \\"based on their age, longevity, beauty and architectural uniqueness.\\" In 1967, St. John‚Äôs in Clifton Springs, St. John's in Phelps, and Trinity Mission in Shortsville were merged into one parish ‚Äì St. John‚Äôs in Clifton Springs.

She is known for her research pertaining to sexual assault and violence against women and children and the effects of treatment by law enforcement and medical staff on victims' psychological and physiological well-being. Campbell has been involved in criminal justice research on the investigation of Detroit's untested rape kits, wherein DNA evidence obtained in thousands of rape kits was left in storage and not analyzed. She has received numerous awards for her work including the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues Louise Kidder Early Career Award (2000), the American Psychological Association (APA) Early Career Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest (2008), the APA Division 27 Council on Educational Program‚Äôs Excellent Educator Award (2015), and the U.S. Department of Justice Vision 21 Crime Victims Research Award (2015).  Biography  Campbell received her B.S. degree in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1991. She then went on to graduate school at Michigan State University, where she obtained her M.A. in ecological community psychology in 1993 and her Ph.D in ecological community psychology in 1996. After graduating, she joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Michigan State University. Campbell received funding for \\"The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative\\" from the Bureau of Justice. She has received other grants from the National Institute of Justice, National Institute of Mental Health, American Evaluation Association, and Michigan Department of Community Health. Campbell co-created the Rape Prevention and Education Model that provides social workers with guidelines on how to address factors that increase risk of sexual assault. She is the author of Emotionally Involved: The Impact of Researching Rape (2002), a book about the emotional effects of conducting research involving victims of traumatic events. Along with teaching and research, Campbell has engaged in police department training in cities such as Houston, Texas, Detroit, Michigan, and Washington, D.C. She has also been involved in training initiatives of the International Association of Forensic Nurses.  Research  Campbell has examined how mistreatment of sex crime victims by law enforcement and medical staff leads to secondary victimization. In \\"The Neurobiology of Sexual Assault\\", she discussed an incident where a woman tried to report a sex crime, but was discouraged by a detective who did not believe her story. Campbell's research team tracked sexual assault cases in six different communities over twelve years and found that 86% of the victims did not go through with prosecution. Their findings indicated that victims of sex crimes are often shunned by law enforcement. Overall, 90% of sexual assault victims experienced some aspect of secondary victimization, which left them feeling hopeless and with varying degrees of depression and anxiety. In 70% of cases, victims reported that law enforcement officers asked them what they had been wearing. In such cases, law enforcement officers may have had a preconceived idea that the victim provoked the attack. This tendency to blame the victim for the sexual assault may lead the victim to relive the experience of being traumatized. Campbell and colleagues also reported that 69% of the victims were discouraged from continuing with litigation, with 51% of the victims stating that law enforcement told them that the assault was not serious enough to pursue. Campbell found that law enforcement officers tend to ask questions such as \\"Why didn't you fight back?\\", \\"Why didn't you scream?\\", or \\"Why didn't you call for help?\\". Her research found that many sexual assault victims went into tonic immobility, a neurobiological condition where the victim is in paralysis. Campbell refers to this as \\"fight, flight, or freeze\\". When in a traumatic situation, a person will usually fight or try to escape; however, in many cases the person may become immobilized and not know what to do. During a sexual assault, opiates are released in the body, which may lead the victim to feel emotionless and limp, as if their body were shutting down. These reactions may be misinterpreted by law enforcement; the victim may appear to not care and not be taking the situation seriously, which might lead detectives to close the case. In Campbell's research, law enforcement officials were reported to say things like \\"I know she's lying\\" or \\"her story doesn't add up.\\" Campbell found that during a sexual assault the hormone cortisol is released, which affects the part of the brain responsible for memory and may explain why victims have a hard time recollecting what happened. In conducting research on the effects of stress on memory, she found that processes of memory consolidation helped victims to recall the events. That is, victims were better able to recall details after taking time to relax and reflect back on the events than when they were subjected to intense interrogation.

It is allegorical in that the story of a fantastic voyage disguises a satire on contemporary society. Background Popanilla was published in 1828, a period of Disraeli's life described by one of his biographers as ‚Äúalmost a blank‚Äù. It had been submitted to the publisher John Murray four years earlier entitled \\"The Adventures of Mr. Aylmer Papillion\\" but was rejected. As an allegorical novella describing a fantastic voyage, it was influenced by Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and probably by works of Samuel Johnson and Voltaire. Synopsis Fantaisie is an undiscovered remote and idyllic island in the Indian Ocean with mermaids and serpents. One day the indigenous people's sunset is disturbed by a ship, which they presume to be a sea monster, sinking. Popanilla is on the beach looking for the hair lock of his mistress which he has lost. He comes across a sea chest and investigates its contents, namely books. After a spell in seclusion reading the books, Popanilla returns to his community and tries to convince the king and the assembly that they should develop as an island. They do not understand what he means and the king banishes him. However his ideas gain traction with the young men on the island, such that the king summons him back. Sarcastically the king says that he should seek what is required for the island's development and has him despatched on a canoe out in the ocean. After 3 days on the ocean, Popanilla comes to a civilised island (Vraibleusia) where he is shown round its capital (Hubbabub) by Skindeep. He learns that, despite being the richest nation in the world, it is heavily in debt. Popanilla exchanges the gold he brought from Fantaisie for the island's currency, pink shells which, although readily available on the island's beach, can only be collected on pain of death, other than by the authorities. Skindeep is not able to answer the ‚ÄúGreat Shell Question‚Äù, i.e. what would happen if everyone enacted their entitlement to convert their shells to gold. All the island's corn is supplied by the centuries-old ‚ÄúAboriginal Inhabitant‚Äù since this has always been the case. alt=A young man of vaguely Semitic appearance, with long and curly black hair Popanilla is a star attraction of Vraibleusia and is proclaimed as the Ambassador for Fantaisie. He is invited to meet an ancient patched-up statue which can speak no wrong and is the ultimate power on the island, his decrees causing the stock market to ebb and flow. A massive fleet full of goods is prepared to set sail for Fantaisie. Vast quantities of pink shells are issued to finance the fleet, leading to a massive stock boom which creates a nouveau riche strata sadly lacking in manners. Whilst the fleet is away, an island off the coast of Vraibleusia is spotted and Popanilla worries that he will be much less of a celebrity as a result. The island, however, turns out to be an uninhabited rock but the Vraibleusians colonise it nonetheless. Popanilla is then appointed to a role with horticultural responsibilities so reads a \\"chapter on fruit\\" which the novel includes. The chapter explains that fruit on Vraibleusia was originally under the control of the \\"market gardener\\". Then the inhabitants discovered delicious pine-apples from a foreign country which over time came under the control of the \\"Prince of the World\\" who knew nothing of the market gardener. In order to protect domestic markets, imported pine- apples were banned and Vraibleusian ones produced instead. The problem was that they tasted disgusting and so this inspired demand for all sorts of other fruit, of which crab-apples were particularly prominent. This in turn inspired a backlash against the pine-apple producers. The statue was broken and its head fell off before some time later a \\"stout soldier\\" salvaged the head and ruled by its authority since he was the only person who could understand what it was saying. After the stout soldier's death, the head was rejoined to the body and the statue's patched-up mechanisms resumed working. Vraibleusia plunges into economic depression and violence as a consequence of the fleet returning, having not found Fantaisie. Popanilla is arrested for high treason. After a spell in prison, Popanilla is tried for stealing 200 camelopards, which he has never seen in his life. It turns out this is a traditional charge as a precursor to the treason indictment even though camelopards have been long extinct on Vraibleusia. After various witnesses are unconvincing in their defence of Popanilla, by virtue of the intervention of a \\"remarkably able young man\\", the judge instructs the jury to acquit him which they do. Popanilla resolves to emigrate and the novel ends with speculation on what may have happened to Popanilla's second voyage. Analysis and interpretation Many of the characters and geographies in Popanilla represent people and places in Disraeli's contemporary society. Vraibleusia represents England and its capital Hubbabub, London.Diniejko The initials \\"SDK\\" which appear on the luggage Popanilla finds washed up on the shores of Fantaisie stand for \\"Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge\\".Diniejko The \\"remarkably able young man\\" who gets Popanilla acquitted at the end of the novel is Robert Peel.Diniejko The statue is \\"Disraeli's ironic personification of the English monarchy\\".Schwarz p80 The \\"Aboriginal Inhabitant\\" is used as a vehicle for ridiculing the Corn Laws. According to one critic, \\"[Popanilla] satirises ideas and institutions that the author would later champion\\".Dyer p138 Disraeli's biographer Robert Blake wrote that Popanilla ‚Äútakes off the more absurd extravagances of the Benthamites‚Ä¶It also laughs at the Corn Laws and the colonial system.‚Äù Blake pp53-4 =Colonial system= Disraeli, who would go on to be Prime Minister of Great Britain when its empire approached its height, satirises the colonial system when Popanilla asks Skindeep about the governance of an uninhabited territory: > 'Upon what system,' one day enquired [Popanilla] of his friend Skindeep, > 'does your Government surround a small rock in the middle of the sea with > fortifications, and cram it full of clerks, soldiers, lawyers and priests?' > 'Why, really, your Excellency, I am the last man in the world to answer > questions; but I believe we call it THE COLONIAL SYSTEM'. =Benthamism and Utilitarianism= The main target of Popanilla's satire is utilitarianism. Prior to discovering the knowledge of Benthamite theory brought to him by the shipwrecked books, Popanilla lives in a \\"state of nature\\" similar to paradise.Schwarz p79 Popanilla's advocacy of man being a \\"developing animal\\" is \\"a parody of utilitarianism\\".Schwarz p79 Popanilla observes all the features and absurdities of the highly developed Vraibleusia culminating in the economic ruin, depression and violence following the expeditionary fleet's failure but still maintains to one of its victims, Skindeep, that he (Skindeep) is happy because: > he might therefore still be a useful member of society; that, if he were > useful, he must therefore be good; and that if he were good, he must > therefore be happy; because happiness is the consequence of assisting the > beneficial development of the ameliorating principles of the social > action.Bradenham ed. p98 =Religion= The chapter on fruit is a parody of English ecclesiastical history. Catholics are represented by the pineapple eaters, Puritans by the crab eaters and Anglicans by consumers of inferior pineapples whilst \\"the market gardener\\" is a reference to Christ (who was mistaken for a gardener by Mary Magdalene) and the Prince of the World the Pope.Schwarz pp80-1Dyer p134 =Other themes= Critics have also suggested that the novel lampoons sexual licence, silver-fork novels of the sort Disraeli would later write, and stock market bubbles.Schwarz p79Dyer p131 Reception Despite amusing both John Bright and Robert Plumer Ward, Popanilla \\"attracted little attention at the time or since\\".Blake p54Diniejko  References  Novels by Benjamin Disraeli 1828 British novels ","title":"Popanilla"},{"id":"55915475","text":"Deutsche Arbeiter-Marseillaise (English: German Worker Marseillaise) is a song written in 1864 by Jacob Audorf for the General German Workers' Association to the melody of the Marseillaise.

History  Jarrett was born in Adelaide, the fourth son of Aaron Jarrett (died 1910) and his wife Martha Emily Jarrett (died 1919) n√©e Palmer, farmers near Maitland. He followed his parents sas a farmer, with a property near Maitland, which he sold up in 1920 and moved to Adelaide. He entered a partnership with his cousin (?) Lendon Arthur Harper (1892‚Äì1971) as Harper & Jarrett, general engineers at Clarence Park. In August 1923 they floated, with one Arthur Landseer Colville (1884‚Äì1973), Millswood Auto and Radio Company with ¬£30,000 capital, to take over their business assets and develop a radio broadcasting facility at Millswood. Harper was appointed general manager, and S. L. Copley sales manager. Directors included Harper, Jarrett, S. J. Hunt, E. F. Gryst and R. G. Germein. The company entered into negotiations with J. C. Williamson Limited and J. & N. Tait to secure entertainment programmes and together founded the South Australian Broadcasting Company to formalise the relationship, with no doubt an eye to creating a monopoly. The company's business plan was to broadcast high-class radio programmes from their transmitting station 5MA and to gain income from sale of receivers fixed on their wavelength of 850 metres (this followed the Government passing laws in August 1923 that standardised the \\"Sealed Set\\" model of broadcast listening as recommended by Ernest Fisk) and signed a contract with AWA for provision of transmitter and receivers. In October 1923 they demonstrated one of their radios installed in a motor-car, picking up signals from a transmitter located at Alberton. They appointed agents in country areas where they had proved their signal could be received reliably, opened a retail store at 113 Gawler Place, and engaged salesmen to sell receivers on commission. By December 1923 5MA was one of only six stations throughout Australia which were licensed to broadcast under this system. An AWA 250-watt transmitter was installed at 261 Goodwood Road in April 1924, pending supply of a 3000-watt unit. Their plans unravelled a few months later, when the Government reversed its \\"sealed set\\" policy, replacing it with a system of publicly supported stations (\\"A-class\\") and those which supported themselves by advertising or otherwise (\\"B-class\\"), and tuneable receivers becoming legal if licensed. This cost dearly those who had invested in \\"sealed sets\\". To compound matters for Jarrett and partners, the wavelength they had opted for (850m or 350kHz), though an excellent choice for long- distance broadcasting, was outside the medium-wave broadcast band (530 ‚Äì 1700kHz), so could not be picked up by ordinary radios. They had lost their position as South Australia's prime broadcaster to 5CL, which won the State's allocated \\"A-class\\" licence. They opened a store, warehouse and factory at 109 King William Street in 1924. 107‚Äì109 was in 1962 the Ambassadors Hotel. In 1925 he sold the Gawler Place business for ¬£275; it became \\"Metro Electrical Radio\\" in 1926 with proprietors named as Jarrett and Rosslyn Arnold \\"Ross\\" Thomas (1900‚Äì1979). Jarrett, who was worth ¬£25,000 (many millions of dollars in today's currency) after selling his farm, attempted to regain his lost fortune by buying and selling real estate in partnership with Alfred Leslie Wyly (1867‚Äì ), and by 1937 was bankrupt.

The piece was most likely composed in the early years of Bach's tenure at Weimar (1708‚Äì1717).

New Bach Edition (NBE), Series IV: Organ Works, Vol. 7: Six Sonatas and Various Individual Pieces. B√§renreiter, 1984 (Score) and 1988 (Critical Commentary) Breitkopf's 21st-century new Urtext edition also uses this name for BWV 572. Most printed editions entitle it a Fantasia, but there is little suggestion of improvisation, particularly in the main, central movement. Many recitalists refer to it in their programmes as \\"Piece d'Orgue\\", its title in all the contemporary copies; but this, according to Peter Williams, is possibly misleading, as there is little French about the music itself, except the use of ninths and sevenths in the style of de Grigny (in the middle alla breve section) and the possible allusion to French plein jeu music (by the choice of the key of G major). The work could more accurately be described as a toccata, since it shares in the tradition of sectional toccatas (as conveyed by Buxtehude) with a central contrapuntal section that is surrounded by a toccata-like framework. Structure The piece starts in compound quadruple meter (). This movement is very dynamic and cheerful, and features complete absence of the pedal. The broken chords shared between left and right hand do not seem to have a parallel in any work by another composer, though Williams notes a similarity in the \\"idea of running semiquavers for hands followed by a sustained durezza passage with pedals\\" with a prelude by Christian Friedrich Witt. The youthful vigor and digital dexterity of the opening movement leads to a broken tonic pedal point, which then transitions to the contrapuntal central section which features five voices. In contrast to the first movement, it employs the entire range of the instrument. The dense texture of the movement makes it more idiomatic for the instrument and more typical for Bach. The movement uses long held chords with many suspensions to great effect, an idiom which Bach employed with relative frequency in his mature works. The contrapuntal section fails to resolve back to its key chord, and instead leads into a coda which shows close similarities to the final line of BWV 565, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor.

Regarding his Islamic belief, he was a Sufi murshid (scholar of spirituality) belonging to the Shattari tariqa based in Minangkabau region. pp.304-307. Biography =Early life and education= Burhanuddin was born under the name Pono. He was born in the coastal city of Ulakan (today's Pariaman) within a sub-district of Padang Pariaman Regency. During his childhood, he was not aware of the teaching of Islam, because his parents and society had not been familiar with the religion. He and his father embraced Buddhism instead. Later, at the invitation and preaching of a Gujarat merchant who then spread Islam in Pekan Batang Bengkawas (now Pekan Tuo), young Burhanuddin and his father left Buddhism and converted to Islam. At the age of maturity, Burhanuddin began to wander and leave the place of his parents. He studied in Aceh under Sheikh Abdur Rauf as-Singkili, an influential Mufti of Aceh Sultanate, who was a disciple and follower of Sheikh Ahmad al-Qusyasyi from Medina.\\"Chaerul Umam: Islam Dalam Karya Visual Masih Minim\\", Kompas, 1 April 2004. Sheikh Ahmad had authorized both As-Singkili and Burhanuddin to spread Islam in their respective regions. For ten years, Burhanuddin learned various sciences of Islam and tariqa from As-Singkili. Among the fields he studied include science in Arabic language, tafsir, hadith, fiqh, tawheed (science of monotheism), tasawwuf (science of Islamic mysticism), aqidah (Islamic creed), sharia and the concepts concerning tariqa, such as haqiqa and marifa. =Proselytization= After thirty years of studying in Aceh, Burhanuddin returned to his native Minangkabau to spread the teachings of Islam there. In 1680, he returned to Ulakan and established a surau (Islamic assembly building) in Tanjung Medan, located in a complex of about five hectares. There, he spread the teachings of Islam as well as developed the Shattari tariqa. In this surau, many religious and social activities were performed, such as the daily prayers, study of religion, musyawarah (consensus-based decision making), da'wah (proselytization) and the learning of arts and martial arts.Penelitian Rumah Ibadah Bersejarah: Surau Gadang Syekh Burhanuddin Ulakan Padang Pariaman Sumate. Kemenag. Retrieved 29 April 2014. The surau grew rapidly and later became a pesantren (boarding school style Islamic seminary). Burhanuddin received tremendous respect from the people, and the teachings he brought were widely accepted there. Students came to learn both from within the Minangkabau region and outside of it including Riau, Jambi, and Malacca. Through his boarding school, Burhanuddin taught various Islamic disciplines to his santris (students of pesantren), such as tafsir, hadith, fiqh, aqidah, and others. He also provided da'wah through pengajian (religious studying) to the community. With the effort of Burhanuddin, the teachings of Islam quickly spread in the Minangkabau region. =Death= Burhanuddin died ten years after the establishment of the pesantren.

Genre, authorship and date  Utatane no S≈çshi is a work of the otogi-z≈çshi genre. Tradition attributes it to a daughter of the 15th-century courtier and poet Asukai Masachika. One of the surviving manuscripts, an emakimono (illustrated hand-scroll), was contained in a box whose inscription crediting two mid-15th-century men as responsible for the manuscript: Tosa Mitsunobu is credited with the illustrations and Iio Mototsura (È£ØÂ∞æÂÖÉÈÄ£, 1431‚Äì1492) with the calligraphy. Although this dates the manuscript, the work itself may be older, as its depiction of courtly life evokes the Heian period more than the chaos of the Sengoku period.  Plot  The work opens by quoting a waka poem of Ono no Komachi, utatane ni / koishiki hito wo / miteshi yori / yume ch≈ç mono wa / tanomi someteki, which portrays the poet longing for her lost lover coming to believe in her dreams as they are the only place where she can meet him. The female protagonist, a lonely young noblewoman, receives a romantic gift in a dream, but is unable to identify her dream suitor. When she next sleeps, she dreams that she meets the young man, described as fairer than Shining Genji, but she is still unable to learn his identity before he says he must leave. Distraught, the lady determines to visit Ishiyama-dera and pray to Kannon, and sets out on foot in a fashion that mirrors Tamazakura from The Tale of Genji. At the temple, she encounters a man, named Sadaish≈ç, who has the same voice as the figure in her dream, and listens in on his conversation with another man. She overhears the man say that he has seen a beautiful woman in his dreams and longs to meet her in reality. The lady decides that it would be unseemly to reveal herself to the man, choosing to place her faith in Kannon instead. Later, while visiting an associate, she falls off a bridge into a river. Shrieking for help, she is saved by a boat that happens to be passing by. On the boat is Sadaish≈ç, who is overcome by her beauty; she forgets her embarrassment, and the two are united.

Early life and education Sutherland earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Tufts University in 1967. He went on to study film at the University of Southern California (USC). Career Sutherland began producing documentaries a decade after leaving USC. One of his earliest films, Down Around Here, which he began filming while working at his father's tire store in the 1970s, profiled a gritty diner that Sutherland frequented. Matt Ashare of The Phoenix called the film \\"a poignant and remarkably resonant sketch of Boston's rapidly fading past.\\" Much of his early work focuses on art and artists, including Paul Cadmus and Jack Levine. Of Paul Cadmus: Enfant Terrible at 80, New York Times critic John O'Connor said, \\"Television has never been completely at ease in dealing with art and artists... Then, every once in a great while, a film comes along to demonstrate other possibilities, other approaches. One such production is Paul Cadmus: Enfant Terrible at 80...Mr. Cadmus has been served well by Mr. Sutherland... The intense close-up succeeds in illuminating something of the artistic process that, no matter the finished style, is always profoundly serious.\\" A reviewer for The Boston Globe said of Sutherland's 1989 film Halftime: Five Yale Men at Midlife, \\"A relentlessly stunning film. With the possible exception of The Thin Blue Line, no documentary in recent memory delivers more psychological insight--or emotional wallop. The pacing is flawless, the editing superb.\\" According to the Baltimore Sun, Sutherland is \\"considered by those who know documentaries to be one of the nation's greatest practitioners of the form\\". His films have been cited for their \\"depth of intimacy and long-form commitment to the filmmaking process\\" with some productions taking as long as three years or more to film. Also notable is his unique audio style. For his most recent film, Kind Hearted Woman, Sutherland used up to six microphones at a time to produce over 300 hours of audio recordings, which he eventually edited down for the 5-hour film. Of the result, Brian Lowry of Variety said, \\"Those familiar with Sutherland‚Äôs work know he seeks out personal stories and follows them at an unhurried, almost-hypnotic pace, extracting intimate portraits through years of painstaking filming. He has done that and then some with [Kind Hearted Woman].\\" Mark Rogers of Slant Magazine called Kind Hearted Woman \\"one of the most compelling documentaries on modern Native American life to date.\\" Sutherland's Jack Levine: Feast of Pure Reason was cited by The Boston Herald as one of the ten best films of 1986, and it won 23 awards, including a Blue Ribbon from the American Film Festival. Out of Sight, one of Sutherland's feature-length films, played at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1994. Gerald Peary of The Improper Bostonian said of the film, \\"Out of Sight is an uncompromised, unexpected take on a blind woman, but what a blind woman! Put away all your politically correct assumptions...Starin is a hellion out of a 1940's Hollywood film noir.\\" The Television Critics Association nominated his 1998 production The Farmer's Wife in the Best Program of the Year, Best Miniseries & Specials, and Best News & Information Program categories. Country Boys was nominated in the Outstanding Achievement in News & Information category in 2006. Writing for MTV News, Shirleen Holt named two of Sutherland's films among the five best documentaries available on DVD while Erik Ernst of Wisconsin Public Television has called his productions \\"some of the most important documentaries ever to air on public television\\". He is currently working on a new film, Semper Fidelis (working title), which follows Elizabeth Perez, a US Marine veteran, as she fights to reunite her family after her husband, Marcos, is deported. The film is set to air late in 2018.

Ellis' murder has remained unsolved after 50 years despite periodic cold case inquiries and the availability of the offender's DNA sample which has been tested against 200 men. History Ellis, who grew up in Stevenage, joined the WRAF on 28 April 1967 and accomplished her basic training at RAF Spitalgate in Grantham, Lincolnshire. At the time of her murder, Ellis was working in the kitchens of the St. Mary's Hospital catering department on the camp at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire. On the night of 11 November 1967, Ellis was due to babysit for Wing Commander Roy Watson and his wife. The Wing Commander arrived at the WRAF block at 7:40 pm to pick Ellis up, but she was not there. He waited for 15 minutes before leaving and coming back 10 minutes later with his wife, who could, under the RAF rules of the time, enter the female block. Ellis was not in the block. It was reported some time later that the police believed Ellis had got into the wrong car as she had never met Wing Commander Watson before. Ellis was last seen alive at 8:00 pm on 11 November, but as there were two functions on at the camp that night (disco and bingo) the camp was very busy with hundreds of people on the base. Her body was found by a dogwalker the next day (12 November) in Rowborough Copse, a piece of woodland on the western edge of the camp where a disused railway line used to bring supplies into the camp. She had been beaten, sexually assaulted, and strangled and an effort had been made to hide her body under foliage. Police did question a man about the murder, but no charges were ever brought. Cold case On the 40th anniversary of her death, a cold case inquiry was launched by Thames Valley Police as part of a greater investigation into unsolved crimes going back over 50 years. The detective superintendent in charge of the case appealed for witnesses to come forward. In 2012, police were also looking at an attack on a student nurse in Tring that at the time was tentatively linked to Ellis' death. The woman was raped and hit over the head with a blunt instrument, and police believed the attacker was leaving her for dead, but miraculously, she survived. The attack occurred only away from where Ellis was found murdered and whilst there were no definitive links, certain characteristics were very similar. In November 2017, Thames Valley Police again announced that they were looking at the case. This time, however, they had a DNA sample which had been tested against 200 men, as well as the national DNA database. DNA analysis indicated that the sample belonged to a male and whilst the family of Ellis remained hopeful, they acknowledged that the perpetrator could be dead, as his age was assumed to be between his late sixties and early eighties. The reports, correspondence and statements about the case are sealed in the National Archives with a prospective opening date on 1 January 2070.

Atilla (17-mj- b 2197, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York) is an Iranian sanctions case in New York. Mehmet Hakan Atilla an executive at Halkbank was accused of conspiring with Iranian-Turkish businessman Reza Zarrab, using the U.S. financial system to conduct transactions on behalf of Iran and other Iranian entities, which were barred by United States sanctions, and to delude U.S. financial institutions by concealing the true nature of these transactions. Atilla found guilty for bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. Background In December 2013 an investigation involved Reza Zarrab, Iranian billionaire Babak Zanjani, the sons of three ministers (Erdoƒüan Bayraktar, Muammer G√ºler and Zafer √áaƒülayan) in the Turkish government and Egemen Baƒüƒ±≈ü revealed a system to help Iran bypass US sanctions against the country concerning the SWIFT payment system, in a scheme based on Turkish public bank Halkbank, whereby money was transferred to front companies in China and Turkey, and gold bought with that money transferred to Iran via Dubai. However, Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the investigation as a \\"judicial coup\\" against his government, dismissed the prosecutors and police officials investigating the corruption scheme. The accused parties released soon after. On 19 March 2016, Reza Zarrab was arrested in Miami, Florida, for conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. Halkbank Deputy Chief Executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was in connection with Zarrab, was also arrested in the United States in March 2017 with similar offenses. U.S. v Zarrab (15-cr-867, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York) is an Iranian sanctions case in New York. it is still unresolved. In March 2016, Turkish-Iranian gold dealer Reza Zarrab was arrested in Miami. Kamelia Jamshidy, an employee of Zarrab's, and Hossein Najafzedah of Bank Mellat were also named in the federal indictment. Zarrab had an office in Trump Towers Istanbul. Zarrab is accused of violating the Iranian sanctions regime by concealing bank transactions that transferred gold and American currency to the Iranian government. Zarrab, Jamshidy and Najafzedah have been charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions law, bank fraud, and money laundering. Bloomberg has reported that Iran used the state-run Turkish Bank Turkiye Halk Bankasi to process hundreds of millions of dollars in oil revenue. Prosecutors allege that these transactions were fraudulently concealed as food shipments and other commerce allowed under sanctions. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman of the Southern District of New York. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and members of his administration have made several requests to the United States to drop the case. Prosecutors have noted that Zarrab has close ties with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and donated $4.5 million to a charity founded by his wife Emine Erdoƒüan. Case Mehmet Hakan Atilla, deputy chief executive officer at state-owned Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS, accused of conspiring with Zarrab to launder money and violate sanctions on Iran, funneling Iranian funds illegally by using the U.S banking system. In November , 2017, Zarrab cooperated with federal prosecutors and has become key witness in the prosecution of Mehmet Hakan Atilla.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/does-cooperating-witness-have- info-flynn-tie-turkey-n821341 In his testimony Zarrab explained how he paid 50 million dollar in bribes to Turkish Minister of Economic Affairs Zafer Caglayan, on a screen Zarrab showed the amounts and dates of the payments records that were sent to Turkish officials in the inner circle of President Erdogan. Moreover, he claimed Turkish President Erdoƒüan, prime minister at that time, had personally given orders to start transactions on behalf of Iran. Mehmet Hakan Atilla was found guilty on five charges related to conspiracy and bank fraud including violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, crimes to deceive the U.S. and defrauding U.S. banking system, but was acquitted of money laundering.

She was a bilingual writer, using both English and Chinese. Li was known for her plays, short stories and especially for her newspaper column, \\"Bamboo Green.\\"  Biography  Li was born in Shanghai in 1923. Her father, Li Kuo Ching, left to work in the United States, leaving Li's mother to raise her in China. He eventually abandoned his family when Li's mother would not move to the U.S. When China was invaded by Japan in 1937, she moved to Hunan, and then to Hong Kong. She went to Mills College in 1940, where graduated with a degree in chemistry. After she graduated at Mills, she worked for a short time in an aluminum smelting plant in New Jersey as a lab assistant. She started studying organic chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but transferred to Cornell University where she earned her master's degree in literature in 1946. At Cornell, her master's these was on Chinese folk literature. In July 1946, she married Ho Rih Hwa, who was also a student at Cornell. She and her father also reconciled at this time. Her father sent her to Bangkok in 1948, where she became the chief chemist analyzing tungsten ores that her father exported, trading with the Wah Chang Group company. Her family then moved to Yangon in 1949. Later, Li helped her father set up tapioca factories and other food-related ventures. Li's daughter, Ho Minfong, was born in Yangon in 1951. Minfong would go on to become a noted writer. Her son, Ho Kwon Ping, was born in Hong Kong in 1952 and later became a businessman. Li has another son, Kwon Cjan, who is also involved in business. In 1952, Li returned to work for the company, and was eventually made the vice-chair of Wah Chang. Li's husband became Singapore's ambassador to Thailand in 1967. After Thailand, he was made the ambassador to several European countries and entities, meaning that Li lived in Europe until the early 1970s, when they moved to Singapore. Li died on 3 August 2011 after going into a coma following a massive brain haemorrhage. She died in the National University Hospital. Li was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014.  Work  The Sword Has Two Edges had its origins in research she started in 1956 on the story of San Guo Shi Yan Yi. Li wrote the manuscript quickly and when she was asked to rewrite it as a comedy, she put it away, only to revisit the story in 1971. A member of the Experimental Theatre Group, D. Murugan, decided to produce the play in 1977. Her next play, Trials and Turbulence of the Twilight Years won a first place award in its category from the Ministry of Culture in 1978. In 1981, her play, The Late Storm was produced. Li wrote a popular column in English and Chinese, called \\"Bamboo Green\\" which ran between 1979 and 1984 in The Straits Times. In 1986, a compilation of her columns, A Joss Stick for My Mother was released. Li revived the column in 1993, and continued to write it until 1998. The column educated Singaporeans on Chinese history, literature, life and culture. Li then started writing a Chinese column for the Lianhe Zaobao between 1998 and 2009. Li published the Chinese version of her memoir, A Daughter Remembers, in 2010, with the English translation coming out after her death.

Schools  * Nashoba Regional High School * Stow  Hale Middle School  The Center School * Bolton  Florence Sawyer School * Lancaster  Mary Rowlandson Elementary School  Luther Burbank Middle School  Governance  The district is primarily run by a single superintendent, who answers to an eight member school board, which is made up of citizens of the three towns that the district serves. There was also previously an assistant superintendent, whose position was removed in February, 2011 due to budget cuts.  History  = Before the district = Early students in the area that would eventually become the district were usually taught privately, often by the minister. The first record of schooling in Stow dates to December 13th, 1714, when a schoolmaster was chosen. Initially teaching was done in private houses, but in 1733, three school- houses were built. By 1789, the town had grown to five school-houses, at which time the state legislature mandated the creation of small school districts that would serve a fraction of a town. Correspondingly, each school-house was turned into a district. These small schools only taught up to a middle school education. Shortly after 1823, Stow created an academy, aptly named Stow Academy, to teach \\"the languages and higher branches of English.\\" Students came to this school from across Massachusetts, New England, as well as Louisiana, Maryland, and what would later become Canada. The academy closed down about twenty years later, likely because the other area schools had improved in quality. Stow established Hale High School in 1871 after a donation of $5000 from Elijah Hale. The school used the building and grounds of Stow Academy until 1903, when the building was rebuilt. As transportation became easier in the early 1900s, this early school district system was done away with completely, replacing the local primary schools with ones for entire towns ‚Äì Stow opened Union School in 1902. = Formation = The Nashoba Regional School District was established in March, 1951 and was originally planned to serve about 400 students. In March, 1953, Stow withdrew from the district, although it later rejoined. Nashoba Regional High School opened in 1961 and by 1966 had 535 students enrolled. The old Stow high school, Hale High School, began to be used for junior high school students and changed its name to Hale Junior High School. The original Hale building burned down in 1963 and was rebuilt in 1964. The new high school had an innovative \\"Curriculum Materials Center\\" that had a focus on electronic media, which was new at the time. = History = In first couple of decades of the district, it only served students from grades 9 through 12, with younger students in elementary superintendency union districts. Even after the district grew to encompass students starting in kindergarten, pre-highschool students had little exposure to students from the other towns in the district, other than through programs like sports camps, like the Nashoba Summer Baseball Camp, which was founded in 2002. In 2010, a summer theatre camp was started at the high school to help students from the three towns get to know each other. The district also includes education programs for preschoolers. In the early 2000s, the district faced some financial issues. In September, 2002, the district eliminated media specialists (ie. librarians) at all the schools in the district other than the high school. After the layoffs, the libraries at the schools were run by volunteers, including retired librarians and the former librarians. In October, the next month, the state put the finances of the district under the control of the state government due to a $3.4 million deficit. The district got a new superintendent, Michael Wood, to help the district financially recover. The district participated in a school choice program that was ended in 2015, due to a lack of space available for incoming students, especially in the high school, although already enrolled students were allowed to remain. It had been proposed and turned down in previous years, due to concerns that the district needed the extra funding provided by the program and that siblings of school choice students should be allowed to attend the same school. Another space saving measure has been to add portable classrooms. In 2012, the district began hiring part-time armed school resource officers to work part time in the high school to help both educate the students in safety and directly protect students from threats. Other security measures, like a buzzer by the entrance, have also been implemented. In 2013, the district instituted a bring your own device program, allowing high school students to bring their personal electronic devices for use in education. In 2015, the district started a program that provided all eighth graders with Chromebooks in order to enhance the learning experience for students.

It is part of the A47 trunk road. History The Acle Straight, heading towards Great YarmouthThe road was originally proposed as a turnpike on 3 May 1830 following an Act of Parliament and engineered by William Thorold. Its purpose was to provide quicker access between the two towns over the Halvergate Marshes. It was designed as two straight sections, connected by a bend halfway along which included a branch road between Seven Mile House and Halvergate. This reduced the distance from Great Yarmouth to Norwich by . The road was constructed by digging two parallel ditches, feet apart, with a surface comprising brushwood, gravel and soil from the ditches. It was largely complete by April 1831 and opened later that year. Tolls were removed from the road in 1861, though they remained on the Yarmouth Suspension Bridge over the River Bure into the town centre until 1920. In 1882, the railway line between Acle and Great Yarmouth was built parallel to the Acle Straight. The Stracey Arms Windpump was built in 1883 near the Halvergate branch road junction. It was Grade II* listed in 1982. A similarly named pub, the Stracey Arms, opened next door to the windmill. It subsequently became popular with boaters on the Norfolk Broads as it sat directly between the Acle Straight and the River Bure and had private moorings. In 2015, it was converted into a Hindu temple. The Acle Straight experienced problems with subsidence. In 1908, a deep pile was planned, but was abandoned after testing found the ground was stable up to a depth of . Traffic The road is a notorious accident spot, with numerous fatalities. As it runs through the middle of uninhabited wetlands, there is no practical alternative route, and detours can be up to . There have been proposals to widen the road to dual carriageway, but these have been rejected owing to environmental concerns. Cultural references Several ghost stories have featured the Acle Straight. A driver passing the turning to the Halvergate branch spotted a man walking out into the middle of the road. Unable to stop, he drove straight through him. There have also been reports of a horse and cart crossing directly in front of oncoming traffic, and drivers have reported wanting to perform an emergency stop for no reason. The Acle Straight is mentioned in the song \\"Stuck In A Rut\\" by local band The Darkness. The lyrics refer to the group trying to get out of their hometown of Lowestoft, with the road as one possible escape route.

It is the 20th overall episode of the series and is written by Ray Utarnachitt and directed by Kevin Bray. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on April 26, 2012. Plot =Flashbacks= In 2010, Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Stanton (Annie Parisse) are on a mission in Morocco. While Stanton interrogates a suspect, Reese calls Jessica (Susan Misner). She needs to talk to him and Reese flies home the next day to meet her. However, they are told by Snow (Michael Kelly) and Corwin (Elizabeth Marvel) to go to a ghost town named Ordos in China and retain a stolen laptop. After everyone leaves, Snow tells Reese that he must kill Stanton after having communicated with an intermediary of Hezbollah. Arriving at Ordos, Reese and Stanton find nearly everyone killed. Stanton interrogates a wounded man and when he confirms that \\"they\\" stole it, she kills him and lies to Reese saying she put him out of mercy. They then retrieve the stolen laptop and steals it from Reese. She shoots him in the gut but they then realize that both were told to kill each other as everyone who came in contact with the Machine. Reese flees just as CIA operatives drop bombs on the building, supposedly killing Stanton. =Present day= Reese helps Carter (Taraji P. Henson) to get a potential killer and saving the husband who was cheating on her. Then, Finch (Michael Emerson) notifies him that they got a new number: Tommy Clay (Pablo Schreiber). Clay works in an armored car sale service and shows no sign of criminal records nor any illegal activity. Reese poses as a trainee in the armored truck where Clay and his partner, Murray Langston (Lenny Venito), operate. When the team picks up platinum valued at $1.25 million, the vehicle explodes and Reese is shot by Clay. Reese awakes in a hospital and is rescued by Carter. Finch tracks Clay to a motel, where his two partners in crime have been killed. Fusco (Kevin Chapman) arrives and realizes that HR is involved in the robbery as Finch finds Clay's partner, a waitress named Ashley (Virginia Kull). Reese finds Clay, and realizes that Clay is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, just before Clay is killed by Ashley. Ashley leaves with the platinum, but is killed by Captain Arthur 'Artie' Lynch (Michael Mulheren), a member of HR, who is in turn killed by Fusco coming to Reese's rescue. Snow and his partner follow a lead that they believe will lead to Reese. They arrive at a hotel, where the partner is killed and Snow is taken hostage by Kara, revealed to have survived the air strike.

This was an 8% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 13.69 million viewers with a 3.0/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night beating The Mentalist, but behind Rules of Engagement, and The Big Bang Theory although being first in terms of viewership, second on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Rules of Engagement, Grey's Anatomy, American Idol, and The Big Bang Theory. =Critical reviews= \\"Matsya Nyaya\\" received positive reviews from critics. Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"By now it's become clear that there are basically two ways to watch Person of Interest. Either you're just there for the fun of the procedural POI of the week format or you're into it for the bigger picture. Last night's episode proved that those of us that have been paying close attention to the flashbacks of the characters have some nice payoff story-wise in the coming final episodes of the first season.\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"Person of Interest returned tonight with the most peculiarly titled episode of the season, 'Matsya Nyaya'. After Reese and Carter wrap up a case involving a cheating husband in the first scene, they get their number for this weeks PoI: Tommy.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.3 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"The series is doing a fantastic job stringing everything together and finding ways to culminate the bigger picture as the season draws closer to the end. It's certainly a testament when you can combine character development, solid action and some cool twists that lead to something more when for the most part the show runs as a procedural.\\"  References  External links * \\"Matsya Nyaya\\" at CBS \\"Matsya Nyaya\\" at TV Guide * Person of Interest (TV series) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Matsya Nyaya"},{"id":"55916044","text":"Maya Devi Chettry was an Indian politician.

Tallulah's music career spanned from 1972 until his death in 2008. Quick witted and sharp tongued, Tallulah was at the heart of London's club scene for more than 40 years, 35 years of those as a groundbreaking DJ, alternative performer, club and bar promoter, and personality.The Times, 8 April 2008 ‚Äì Obituary DJ Tallulah (retrieved 28 November 2017) His lifestyle and career linked him to such iconic figures as playwright Joe Orton and Orton's partner, actor Kenneth Halliwell, actor Kenneth Williams, actress Barbara Windsor, musician Lemmy of (Mot√∂rhead), performance artist Leigh Bowery and DJ Kenny Everett. His varied career also included jobs as a restaurateur, and hotel manager. Family Allam was born in 1948 in Hamburg to English parents. His father worked in the catering and hotel industry and was stationed in Hamburg after WWII to help with the Reclamation. His father's job in Hamburg involved helping to re- establish a hotel. After living in Hamburg for three years, Allam travelled to the UK with his grandmother, where he remained living. When his parents returned to the UK to live permanently, Allam rejoined them. The family moved to nearby Barnehurst in north-west Kent. Just before Allam joined primary school the family relocated again, this time to Maidstone where he spent most of his childhood and early adolescence. At the age of fifteen, Allam attended catering college (East Kent College) in Broadstairs. His early interest in music and fashion stemmed from this era: \\"It would be ‚Äô66. I was well into music by then. Those towns and London were very mod influenced. You know what it‚Äôs like being brought up in the suburbs: for you to make a statement, you put yourself up for criticism in the way you dress, especially during the ‚Äô60s.\\" Tallulah interview conducted by Bill Brewster at DJhistory.com (July 2004) The first record Allam purchased was Then He Kissed Me by the Crystals (1963), which he bought from a record store in Maidstone. The first vinyl album he bought, I Put A Spell On You by Nina Simone (1965), was from HMV record store in Oxford Street, London. The initial moment Allam came face to face with his sexuality was when his parents sent him to ballroom dance classes at the Palace Theatre in Maidstone: \\"Not the best thing to do with a son who‚Äôs slightly fey.\\" Allam became fashion conscious during his early days at college but, as his finances were limited by being a student, in order to look fashionable he resorted to making his own outfits. He would buy Simplicity Patterns and purchase material from a market stall and cut and stitch the clothes himself, but make them tighter than usual. By his late teens, Allam was tall, over 6 ft 2 in, skinny and admitted to being flamboyant. By this time he already knew he was gay, and immersed himself in London's underground homosexual scene and nightlife. As such he came into contact with many closeted gay famous personalities. It was in Canterbury at the Queens Head pub that Allam first met the pirate radio DJ Tom Edwards. Edwards was a DJ on Radio City (a key pirate radio station). They became firm, lifelong friends. It was Edwards that christened Allam ‚ÄòTallulah‚Äô on a Sunday night at a pub in Herne Bay. The name stuck. After Allam's studies at college ended he took a job at the Cora Hotel in Upper Woburn Place in Bloomsbury, London, which he eventually managed.Tallulah article QX Magazine 12 May 2014 (retrieved 4 January 2018):http://www.qxmagazine.com/2014/05/tallulah/ It was at this hotel that he first met the actor Kenneth Williams who lived in an apartment opposite the hotel. Allam would visit Williams at his apartment for tea, and Williams would sometimes rope Allam in to read his scripts with him, with Williams occasionally asking Allam for his opinion of them. Around this period, Allam also socialized with such nonconformist figures as Hugh Paddick, Joe Orton, Kenneth Halliwell, and Victor Spinetti, although Allam confessed there was no glamour involved in these acquaintances, (most of them were experiencing financial hardship) and meetings usually took place over a glass of wine around the kitchen table in one of their apartments. Career =Early career= Tallulah started his career as a DJ in 1972 in a small club called the Escort in Pimlico, London. In between spinning discs his job also entailed acting as the coat-check, collecting empty glasses and keeping the toilets clean. The cabaret act at the club was Hinge & Bracket who went on to achieve huge fame and became a fixture on British TV with their own TV shows and national tours. During the early 1970s, the music played in gay clubs changed considerably due to American imports being readily available in several Soho record stores. 'We‚Äôd gone past pop. There was all this stuff coming in from the States. Every Friday we‚Äôd go up to Quicksilver Records in Hanway Street because that's when the soul imports would arrive - Parliament, George McCrae, especially the Love Unlimited Orchestra‚Äôs ‚ÄòLove‚Äôs Theme.' Also, in the early 1970s cheap flights to the U.S.A. arrived. British entrepreneur Jerry Collins was so impressed by Studio One, a gay disco in Los Angeles, that he returned to London determined to give the capital the same thing.Cultures of Consumption by Frank Mort, publ. Routledge (1996), , page 168 ‚ÄòBang was a deliberate attempt by its deejay and co-founder Jerry Collins to follow an American club model ‚Äì specifically the Studio One club in Los Angeles. Multiple bars, an extensive dance-floor and effective sound systems were the hallmarks of this venture. As at Bang, the emphasis was on size and scale, symbolizing the increased visibility of gay culture.‚Äô This was Bang, which opened in 1976 in the Sundowner (a former ballroom / dance hall) in the basement of the Astoria Theatre in Charing Cross Road.' During this embryonic period of gay club culture in London, Tallulah was still working full-time as a hotel manager as well as DJing most evenings. It's fair to say Tallullah was one of the originators of London‚Äôs gay club scene in as much that he was DJing at such legendary and seminal clubs as Bang and Scandals in London during the early 1970s. It was in 1976 that Tallulah took London by storm when he became the resident DJ at Bang The History of London's Gay Clubs includes mention of Bang club and Tallulah Djing at the club:https://sabotagetimes.com/music/luke- howards-brief-history-of-londons-gay-clubs-pt-1-from-bang-to-heaven at 175 Charing Cross Road.DJ Magazine, 30 July 2015 - Special Feature: The Gay DNA of House Music (article) by Stewart Who: (retrieved 29 November 2017) DJ Princess Julia still remembers the effect Tallulah had on her at Bang in the 1970s: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd go to gay clubs like Bang on a Monday night, which had a light up dance floor. The legendary Tallulah DJ‚Äôd there, total disco on a Monday night‚Ä¶‚ÄôMeet Princess Julia (article) by Martyn Fitzgerald (retrieved 29 November 2017) :http://dalstonsuperstore.com/features/meet-princess-julia/ Tallulah recalled during an interview with Luke Howard in 2006 how the emergence of Bang in 1976 took London by storm, bringing night-clubbing to another level; ‚ÄòEveryone on the scene went to Bang, it appealed to all sorts of queens: leather queens, clones, twirlers and trolley dollies who‚Äôd come back from New York City and tell us what the hot tracks were over there. Bang was a major event on the scene. We had a phone in the DJ booth that linked to the lighting booth and we‚Äôd call up the engineer and tell him to do a black out at the next break, or when to use the strobe effects or do a balloon drop. There was also a huge cinema screen at the back, as the Sundowner [Astoria] was a converted cinema, and we‚Äôd show Busby Berkley dance routines from all the old Hollywood musicals‚Äô. Bang was the UK's first mega gay club. It was founded by Jack Barrie (manager of the Marquee Club in Soho) and disc jockey Gary London (aka Jerry Collins). The club ran on Monday evenings.The Astoria Theatre (history): http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AstoriaTheatreCharingCrossRoad.htm The resident Dj‚Äôs were Gary London, Tallulah and Norman Scott.Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey by Bill Brewster, Frank Broughton, Publisher Headline (22 May 2006) , various pages. ‚ÄòThe minute it came on the scene, it was a huge hit,‚Äô recalled Martyn. ‚ÄòThe queues! It went right round past 100 Club.‚Äô Its instant success prompted the founders to open a second night weekly on Thursdays. The club attracted the likes of Andy Warhol and his entourage,Andy Warhol was visiting London in the Summer of 1976 for the opening of his ‚ÄòCats and Dogs‚Äô exhibition at the Mayor Gallery, London: https://warholstars.org/andy_warhol_exhibition.html Rudolph Nureyev, Rock Hudson,The Way Out: (International Library of Twentieth Century History) by Sebastian Buckle, publisher: I.B.Tauris (30 June 2015), , page 147 ‚Äì Bang attracted crowds of celebrities ‚Äòincluding Rod Stewart, Rock Hudson and David Bowie.‚Äô Elton John, actors, pop stars, film directors and London‚Äôs fashionista. Its 1,000-plus capacity took for the first time gay clubbing in the UK into the mainstream. 1976 was also when the first commercially available 12 inch recordings became available, which were perfect for a club like Bang. Luke Howard's Brief History of London's Gay Clubs: From Bang to Heaven, 15 February 2014 (retrieved 30 November 2017) Tallulah recounts his times at Bang nightclub: https://sabotagetimes.com/music/luke-howards-brief- history-of-londons-gay-clubs-pt-1-from-bang-to-heaven Bang was without doubt the club that created the concept of the mega club (whether gay or straight) in the UK as it is now known. =Relocation to New York= In 1977, Tallulah visited New York where he remained for over a year. It was whilst he was living in New York that he worked at the renowned club Studio 54 behind the bar and operating the lights in the lighting rig (not as a DJ). He did, however, get his Cinderella moment one night and stood in for a DJ that didn‚Äôt turn up for work due to sickness. When asked later in life about dance music culture, Tallulah sniffed: 'The rave lifestyle of Ibiza in the late ‚Äò80s was just a vanilla version of the New York gay lifestyle of the ‚Äò70s.'DJ Magazine, 30 July 2015 - Special Feature: The Gay DNA of House Music (article) by Stewart Who: (retrieved 29 November 2017) When Tallulah first went to Studio 54 in New York, he literally fell at the feet of the owner of the club Steve Rubell. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd moved to New York for 18 months, where I worked at Studio 54. The first time I went there I fell over the velvet rope and landed at Steve Rubell‚Äôs feet and when I stood up I asked him for a job. He put me behind the bar for a while and I stayed for 3 months and probably DJ‚Äôed there about nine times until I got a summer season DJ residency at The Sandpiper on Fire Island.Luke Howard's Brief History of London's Gay Clubs: From Bang to Heaven, 15 February 2014 (retrieved 30 November 2017) Tallulah recounts his time in New York in the 1970s: https://sabotagetimes.com/music/luke-howards-brief- history-of-londons-gay-clubs-pt-1-from-bang-to-heaven =New York Shooting= One night whilst Tallulah was living in New York he was on his way to the Anvil Club when he was shot and passed out. In hospital, nurses found in his arm a pellet dipped in horse tranquilliser. In later years Tallulah would boast, 'I was the first K tragedy.'Tallulah article QX Magazine 12 May 2014 (retrieved 4 January 2018) :http://www.qxmagazine.com/2014/05/tallulah/ =Return to London= Upon his return to London, Allam found himself homeless and moved into the Notting Hill apartment of the pop musician Iain Williams, who later became one-half of the pop duo Big Bang. Williams' former apartment in Colville Terrace, Notting Hll Gate Also living at the apartment was Williams‚Äôs friend Granville King who also happened to be Allam‚Äôs friend, hence the connection. It was Granville (unbeknown to Williams) that allowed Allam to stay temporarily at the apartment while Williams was away. When Williams returned to the UK after a visit abroad, Allam was still staying at Williams‚Äô apartment. Allam remained as a guest at the apartment for over 10 years. Granville was a hairdresser and owned Tallulah Hairdressing Salon in Coram Street, Bloomsbury, (which was named after Tallulah) and was also an alternative cabaret/drag artiste named Gina King. Gina King went on to win the Porchester Hall Drag Ball one year in the late-70s. Tallulah, Granville and Williams labeled themselves ‚ÄòThe Colville Set,‚Äô in a nod to the former artistic ‚ÄòBloomsbury Set,‚Äô and after the bohemian district of Colville in Notting Hill in which they resided. Colville Terrace, Notting Hill Gate Many actors, writers and musicians lived in the area, including the writer Charles Glass, and musician Steven Luscombe of the band Blancmange who had apartments in the same house as Iain Williams, and their next-door neighbour actor Bette Bourne,and further along Colville Terrace the actor Philip Sayer. After returning from America Tallulah found the disco scene in London had really gotten big; 'When I came back from New York the disco scene was peaking and it was easy for me to get work. When I had the residency at Scandals (which meant playing 6 nights a week) they gave me a record allowance of ¬£70 a week, which was a fortune in those days, so I was able to buy all the American and European imports I wanted.‚Äô In the late 1970s, ‚ÄòThe Embassy was London‚Äôs little Studio 54,‚Äô said veteran DJ Tallulah. ‚ÄòThe gay night, Sunday night, was the nearest to a chic club that London ever got. The music was great, and Greg James was a great DJ.‚Äô Last Night a DJ Saved My Life; The History of the Disc Jockey by Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, publ. 2000, Grove Press Tallulah, also DJ‚Äôd at the Embassy Club every Sunday on the gay nights. At the end of the 1970s, Tallulah was involved in the brief roller disco craze where he DJ'ed at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town on a Tuesday night, which was the gay night. Unfortunately it all turned nasty: 'There was a similar black disco in Shepherds Bush and gangs started coming down to us because we were just frothy. They had to put a cage at the entrance, where people were searched. One night a guy jumped on the stage and held a knife to my neck. Then I had a fire extinguisher thrown at me.'Tallulah article QX Magazine 12 May 2014 (retrieved 4 January 2018) :http://www.qxmagazine.com/2014/05/tallulah/ On 13 November 1983, Tallulah opened his own club night, Circus Circus, at Studio Valbonne in Kingly Street, Soho, London. Many celebrities attended the opening night including Steve Strange, April Ashley, Yvette the Conqueror, Vikki de Lambray, and Stephen Luscombe of Blancmange. In 1990, Tallulah was featured alongside Boy George and Leigh Bowery in the Jesus Loves You 7-minute film short Generations of Love directed by Baillie Walsh.Generations of Love (uncensored) Jesus Loves You featuring Boy George Tallulah DJ, and Leigh Bowery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUv6qIc-MBA The film was shot in and around Soho, London, and was produced to promote Jesus Loves You‚Äôs single of the same name.‚ÄòNothing was ever out of bounds‚Äô, interview on Artnet (I July 2019) by Lou Stoppard, with Cerith Wyn Evans and director Baillie Walsh. Baillie Walsh talks about the making of the 1990 Boy George video for ‚ÄòGenerations of Love‚Äô in which Boy George, Leigh Bowery and Tallulah are featured. (retrieved 11 May 2020): ‚ÄòNothing was ever out of bounds‚Äô The short film gives an intriguing snapshot into London‚Äôs Soho nightlife during 1990 (still hungover from the late-1980s) by way of capturing the bustling local outdoor streets, and the inside of long-gone amusement arcades and porn cinemas. Tallulah, in a wig, plays the role of a straight office-type punter, looking for a quick trick, who ends up pulling a transvestite hooker. They visit a Soho porn cinema, where business is dealt. Boy George appears in the film briefly both in drag and as himself. The film has a classic early Andy Warholesque feel to it. On Millennium Night 2000, Tallulah DJ'ed at Delano South Beach club in Miami, 'Studio 54 by the sea.' Tallulah recalled the club as being 'the best gig in the world.' The Delano South Beach Hotel and Club, South Beach, Miami In 2007, photographer Ophelia Wynne Ophelia Wynne photographer:http://www.opheliawynne.com/information/ took a set of photographs of Martyn dressed in an ermine robe holding a staff to celebrate his induction into the UK's House of Homosexual Culture's Hall of Fame. When a reporter asked him his thoughts upon receiving news of the award Martyn affirmed, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm quite honoured, to tell you the truth. I‚Äôve never been much of a publicity seeker, but the reason I‚Äôm doing it is because I think it‚Äôs quite a good thing. I don‚Äôt think we necessarily celebrate individuals in our community enough - it‚Äôs about time we looked to our own people.‚Äô Out Magazine, issue 17, May 2008, page 76 ‚Äì DJ Tallulah 1948 ‚Äì 2008 (picture, obituary & funeral arrangements): http://www.outmag.co.uk/issues/outinthecitymay08.pdf He was the first ever inductee. Tallulah went on to DJ at the heart of London‚Äôs club scene for more than 35 years. In the early days, \\"There were no flyers - it was mainly word of mouth,\\" recalled Tallulah, who was DJing right up until his death. In late-March 2008, when Tallulah failed to turn up to his club residency, fellow DJ and nearby neighbor Tasty Tim went round to Tallulah's apartment off Ladbroke Grove in North Kensington to check that Tallulah was okay.Tallulah article QX Magazine 12 May 2014 (retrieved 5 January 2018) :http://www.qxmagazine.com/2014/05/tallulah/ Tallulah had suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away at his apartment on 28 March 2008. Over 500 people, including many friends, celebrities, and DJ's associated with Tallulah's career, attended his funeral and memorial service on 11 April held at Kensal Rise. A Facebook page ‚ÄòIn Memory of Tallulah‚Äô was set up in his honour for friends and fans to leave their personal memories and tributes. Tallulah's lifelong friend Granville King passed away in 2013. A couple of months prior to Tallulah's passing, Tallulah met up with Iain Williams in Brighton. Tallulah and Williams discussed the writing of the DJ's biography. Williams agreed to write the book and had already commenced drafting it a couple of months before Tallulah's death occurred. The book entitled Club Feet and Disco Dancing is centered on Tallulah's early career and his years spent living with Granville King and Williams in Notting Hill during the culturally subversive 1970s and 1980s. After Tallulah's death, and following the subsequent death of Granville King, Williams has temporarily put the project on hold.

Biography =Early life and career= Vinx attended Kansas State University on a track scholarship. In 1977, he was severely burnt when a racist arson attack destroyed his house and the home of a neighbor. He overcame his injuries and three years later made the world‚Äôs second longest leap in the triple jump. This qualified Vinx for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. When President Jimmy Carter called for an Olympic boycott that year, Vinx‚Äôs athletic goals were put on hold. A radio DJ in college, Vinx also performed with the Kansas State Jazz Band. In 1978, blues singer Taj Mahal invited Vinx to perform with him at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. When Vinx‚Äôs Olympic dream was deferred, he turned his back on track, but after two years returned as an assistant coach for the women‚Äôs track team at the University of Texas at Austin. In Texas, Vinx rediscovered his Olympic ambitions and began working toward the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After an injury at the trials took him out of the running for the ‚Äô84 Olympics, Vinx stayed in Los Angeles and began working as a fitness trainer for the rich and famous. His clients included Stevie Wonder, George Hamilton and Marisa Tomei. =Musical success= In 1987, Vinx landed his first recording session with saxophonist Ernie Watts on his Grammy awarded Musician project. Following singer Tom Jones‚Äô recording of Vinx‚Äôs ballad \\"Touch My Heart,\\" Vinx toured extensively with the likes of Rickie Lee Jones, The BusBoys, Teena Marie, Toni Childs and Robben Ford. His commercial agency work included appearances in both Sprite and Levi's 501 Blues ads. In 1989, Vinx‚Äôs father, Leslie Jackson Parrette Sr. (Vinx‚Äôs greatest musical influence) was mugged and murdered during a family vacation in Detroit. Vinx left the United States for Europe with his all-drum band. Vinx and the Barkin‚Äô Feet played to capacity audiences at the Montreux Jazz Festival, performing after Miles Davis and before Wayne Shorter. Back in the states, keyboardist Herbie Hancock invited Vinx to perform on his Showtime Coast to Coast TV Special, where Vinx played with Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Hornsby, Lou Reed, B.B. King, Herbie Hancock, Kenny G and Woody Harrelson. In 1990, Sting and Miles Copeland signed Vinx to Pangaea/I.R.S. Records. Following Vinx‚Äôs performance on Sting‚Äôs Soul Cages CD, Vinx recorded his first release (Rooms In My Fatha‚Äôs House) for Pangaea. The album featured guest performances from Sheryl Crow, Sting, Herbie Hancock, Taj Mahal, Branford Marsalis, Roscoe Lee Browne and Mother‚Äôs Finest. Vinx toured for 13 months with Sting‚Äôs \\"Soul Cages\\" tour as the solo opening act and the percussionist/background vocalist. The tour ended with a Carnegie Hall taping of MTV Unplugged with Sting. Vinx‚Äôs \\"While The City Sleeps\\" was used in the opening dance sequence of the prime time TV show In Living Color. In 1992, Vinx moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and released his 2nd CD titled I Love My Job. The album featured Zap Mama, Patrice Rushen and Dan Kuramato. Vinx toured the world jazz festival circuit with great response and returned to the States for an appearance on the Arsenio Hall Show and The Tonight Show with old friend Branford Marsalis. Vinx‚Äôs song \\"There I Go Again\\" was chosen for the highest rated episode of the hit TV series Northern Exposure. The network received so many calls about the song that it was chosen for an album release of Northern Exposure‚Äôs most requested music. In 1993, Vinx released his 3rd CD, The Storyteller, which featured Stevie Wonder, George Howard, Cassandra Wilson and Omar. Vinx toured the world and recorded on Cassandra Wilson‚Äôs award-winning CD Blue Light Til Dawn. In 1994, Vinx moved to Boston and started the year with the Stewart Copeland and the Rhythmatists tour. The summer brought Vinx out for a three-month tour with the Spin Doctors, Cracker and the Gin Blossoms, an appearance on the Bertice Berry Show, and performances and CO-MC work for all three days of Woodstock‚Äô 94. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, Vinx was invited by Miles Copeland to his 12th Century French castle for a writer‚Äôs retreat. Vinx co-wrote at the castle with such notables as Brenda Russell, Cher, Michelle Shocked, Jil Sobule and Patty Smyth. 1995 brought Vinx to Africa for a five-week tour of nine countries in West and Central Africa. Vinx and his drum trio were cultural attaches for the U.S. State Department. On his return, Vinx recorded on Stevie Wonder‚Äôs Conversation Peace CD. In 1996, Vinx was inducted into the Kansas State University Athletic Hall of Fame. Vinx released his 4th CD titled Lips Stretched Out. Vinx-the-painter got a rep and held his first gallery showing of his paintings. Vinx headed to Atlanta for his performance at the 1996 Olympiad. Vinx created an innovative Euro dance project called Jungle Funk which featured ex-Living Colour rhythm section musicians Will Calhoun and Doug Wimbish. 1997 - 1999 brought Vinx and Jungle Funk to over 150 shows throughout Europe and Australia with the release of Jungle Funk‚Äôs first limited edition disc; highlighting the early days of the band. Vinx returned to the U.S. for work with the Baltimore-based dance guru‚Äôs \\"The Basement Boys\\" and some recording on Crystal Waters‚Äô track \\"Mama Told Me.\\" In 1998, Jungle Funk got signed to the German label, ESC Records (Zebra/Warner Brothers in the U.S.) with a new release, recorded live in Austria. Vinx received a grant from AT&T; to work with Washington D.C.‚Äôs famed Eastern High School Choir. =Later career= In 1999, Vinx traveled to Berlin to record an album with Traumton Records titled Big ‚Äòn‚Äô Round. Vinx relocated back to Los Angeles to co-write with Brenda Russell, Stewart Copeland, and Darius Rucker. Vinx established his own StankFish Recording Studio, Midnight Archer Publishing Co. and a film production company ‚Äì Dreamsicle Arts & Entertainment. In 2000, Vinx‚Äôs recording studio was robbed with a loss of over $100,000 of recording equipment and masters. In 2003, Will Downing recorded \\"Don‚Äôt Talk To Me Like That\\" ‚Äì written by Vinx and Brenda Russell ‚Äì on his Sensual Journey (Universal) release. Vinx lent his background vocals to the track, which was chosen as the single and charted on the Urban AC charts. Vinx and Peermusic Publishing released a standards record, \\"The Mood I'm In\\", composed of Hoagy Carmichael ballads and other classic songs written by songwriters on the Peer roster. Vinx has added his eclectic twist to songs like \\"Stardust\\". In 2006, Vinx joined the faculty of Berklee College of Music in Boston as a teacher during the Summer 5 week programs. In addition to teaching at Berklee, Vinx founded a critically acclaimed songwriting/creativity workshop series called Songwriter Soul Kitchen . Participants gather for an immersive weekend of exercises, writing, recording, collaborating, performing, food and laughs. Workshops happen 3-4 times per year in the US and abroad. In October 2011, Vinx released his first live record Live from the Sharon Arts Center. His anthem to President Obama debuted on this album. In January 2013, Vinx will release an album of original love songs titled Love Never Comes Too Late through BFMDigital and Dreamsicle Arts & Entertainment.

Intended for sale both as a road car and as a homologated racing vehicle, the racing-configured Avezzano GT4 was first entered in competition in 2017 in the Pirelli World Challenge, while the street version of the automobile was first offered for sale during the summer of 2017. History The Panoz Avezzano is named after the city of Avezzano in Italy, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1915, the destruction spurring the emigration of Don Panoz's grandfather to America. Developed from the preceding Panoz Esperante, the Avezzano was unveiled at the 2016 Petit Le Mans, and appeared at the first annual Atlanta Concours d'Elegance. Using largely aluminium construction, the Avezzano is configured with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, with a Chevrolet V8 engine providing power through a manual transmission. The Avezzano's GT4 racing version was the first model of the car to be introduced, being used by Team Panoz Racing in the Pirelli World Challenge for the 2017 racing season. Ian James scored the first victory for the Avezzano in the World Challenge at Road America in June; James accumulated a total of six wins in the Avezzano over the course of the season, and the team shifted from the GTS class to GT4 for 2018 following homologation as a production vehicle.

Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"The Dreamer Is the Dream is impressive for all the right reasons. Potter's tunes are all top flight, for one. He appears to have written them for the considerable strength of this band and he makes no attempt to ride herd over them. For their part, the players' intuitive engagement with him and one another is dictated by a collective willingness to let the music do the primary talking and respond in kind. This is yet another strong outing for Potter\\". The Guardian 's John Fordham noted \\"there‚Äôs a new creative tension within the quartet for his third ECM album as leader, perhaps because there seem to be two key partnerships complementing and challenging each other within it: Potter‚Äôs with longtime bass sidekick Joe Martin, and Cuban-American pianist David Virelles‚Äô edgier, contemporary one with drummer Marcus Gilmore\\".Fordham, J. The Guardian Review, May 5, 2017 Mike Jurkovic of Elmore Magazine wrote, \\"On his third ECM release, Christ Potter forays further into the creative well of himself and his sax...\\" All About Jazz correspondent Karl Ackermann observed \\"The Dreamer Is the Dream is a testament to Potter's composing as much as to his multi-reed instrumentality. He penned each of the compositions here and they all speak to a deeper sense of mortality, portrayed through lyricism and emotive performances. Potter's responsiveness as a leader shines through in the beautifully orchestrated work of this quartet. One of Potter's best to date\\".Ackermann, K. All About Jazz Review, April 21, 2017 in another review Mark Sullivan noted \\"In short, while this is the most conventional of Potter's ECM albums, it's still a kaleidoscopic affair, full of contrasting moods and tonal colors. It's a splendid showcase for the leader's composing and playing, but still offers plenty of space for the other band members. Here's hoping we hear more from them\\".Sullivan. M.

After serving as Commandant of the Halifax Women's Service Corps, an early Atlantic Canadian women's army corps, Mumford subsequently joined the Canadian Women's Army Corps (CWAC). She served overseas for three years, and was one of the only CWAC members chosen to accompany the invading Allied forces to Italy in 1944.  Early life  Mumford was born January 4, 1909, in Devon, England. In 1930, Mumford immigrated to Canada and began working as a governess, teaching the children of a naval lieutenant.  Career  In 1938, Mumford began to be interested in the idea of forming a women's army corps. Two years later she became Commandant of the Halifax Women's Service Corps, an early Atlantic Canadian predecessor to the Canadian Women's Army Corps (CWAC). The Halifax Women's Service Corps was organized much like the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Mumford was in charge of over 250 women members. On Armistice Day, 1940, Mumford's Halifax Corps marched in uniform to the cenotaph in Halifax Grand Parade, the first time a group of women had ever participated in the service this way. When CWAC was established in 1941, Mumford left Halifax and travelled west to enlist in the new corps as a private. She was sent to England aboard the Queen Elizabeth I, and for two years Mumford worked at the office of the Judge Advocate General at Canadian Military headquarters. As the bombing raids hit London, Mumford also headed a barracks fire team, and was responsible for directing fire hoses at the buildings that were worst damaged. In 1944, Mumford was transferred to a ship destined for Italy. When she reached Gibraltar along the way, her convoy was attacked by German U-boats, and she saw a Canadian medical ship torpedoed and sunk. Upon arriving at their destination, Mumford was one of only 11 CWACs chosen to go into Italy with the invading forces; she evacuated wounded soldiers, sometimes going days without sleep. She remained in Italy until 1945, when the CWACs were recalled to England. She took part in the Victory Parade in London at the end of WWII. After being discharged and returning to Canada, Mumford settled in Victoria, British Columbia. She worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs and National Defence at Royal Roads and CFB Esquimalt, and joined the 5th Field Battery of the Victoria Militia, remaining with the militia until her retirement 15 years later. Mumford was a member of Branch 182 of the Royal Canadian Legion for the rest of her life.  Honours  Mumford was a recipient of the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal, and the Canadian Forces Decoration.  Death  Mumford died on August 28, 2002.

Kingston Whig- Standard, October 22, 1990. The film explores the issue of women's body image, and the prevalence of eating disorders. The film was narrated by Rebecca Jenkins.\\"Women's bodies: A painful obsession Toronto filmmaker explores the emptiness that food can't satisfy\\". Toronto Star, September 6, 1990.The Famine Within is an exploration of the contemporary obsession with body size and shape among North American women. Through the use of conventional documentary interviews and narration in conjunction with striking evocative imagery, the film presents women sharing their own experiences suffering with an eating disorder. The direct testimony of many women who have suffered from the body obsession ‚Äì dancers, mothers, career women, athletes, bulimics, fat women, anorexics, young girls - with the views of leading experts, this work explores the kind of hunger that cannot be satisfied by food. The film is less about illness associated with food, but more raises questions about why so many women are worried about gaining weight or ‚Äúbeing fat‚Äù The film premiered at the 1990 Festival of Festivals. It was subsequently broadcast by TVOntario.\\"Brilliant portrait of a dark obsession: Compelling documentary explores the debilitating eating disorders that reflect North American society's unnatural ideal of the female form\\". The Globe and Mail, September 20, 1990.  Significance  The Famine Within was significant film for the time as it was a direct commentary on the rising numbers of eating disorders among women. The film explores the effects of an ideal feminine beauty on girls and women today, as well as, the social and ideological consequences of their obsession with diet and exercise. Among the many matters discussed are contemporary notions of the superwoman (an image combining thinness and status); the muddled and extreme moral judgments placed on fatness and obesity in our culture; the relation of the Garden of Eden myth to contemporary concepts relating women to food and nature; the ideological implications of the current ‚Äúfitness‚Äù craze. The film is less about illness associated with food, but more raises questions about why so many women are worried about gaining weight or ‚Äúbeing fat‚Äù  Participants  Written by producer-director Katherine Gilday and narrated by actress Rebecca Jenkins featuring various models filmed in a studio. The various women interviewed are all different ages, shapes, and sizes; they range from therapists to patients, from teachers to pupils, from experts to amateurs, and from little girls to young women to gray eminences. With the exception of Paul Ernsberger who is a medical researcher all the participants in the film are women. (9) All the women who speak in the film are white and middle-class, with the exception of the original two-hour TV special.  Themes  Eating disorders, body image, consumerism, mass media  Awards  It won the Genie Award for Best Feature Length Documentary at the 12th Genie Awards.\\"Black Robe sweeps top Genie awards\\". Ottawa Citizen, November 27, 1991.  Praise and Criticism  Cynthia Lucia of Cin√©aste states that the film is moving, highly-charged, and ‚Äúconceptually and visually polished‚Äù. She also observed that a scene in which a model carries a perfectly-proportioned mannequin instead of a brief case is probably an attempt by Gilday to add visual variety, but instead seems ‚Äúforced and almost silly‚Äù. - Cynthia Lucia, Cin√©aste, NY: 1991. In a subsequent interview with Katherine Gilday in Cin√©aste, she refers to a critic at The Village Voice who was concerned that The Famine Within only presents the internal psychological issues and concerns regarding women‚Äôs relationship with their weight. Gilday believes she was clearly portraying a ‚Äúculturally- determined mode of oppression‚Äù (5). Some criticism the film received was that it did not attempt to discuss how cultures outside North America approach the issue of women and weight.(10) In addition, Jonathan Rosenbaum a feminist film scholar criticized the film for its lack of diversity in subjects, featuring only white middle-class women in the 90-minute version. However the full two- hour TV special did hear from women of colour. The film was praised by Gail Vanstone in her dissertation on Studio D‚Äôs films stating that it was ‚Äúa meticulous well researched documentary that analyses the contemporary problem of North American women‚Äôs self image. Mostly composed of talking heads the famine within nevertheless manages to hold together remarkably well. The film presents the case that the modern image of the tall, rail thin supermodel runs counter to nature and ideology and that women are tyrannized by cultural ideals of beauty imposed upon them by patriarchy and the diet industry to the point where one painfully thin young women (who speaks for many) say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be dead than fat‚Äô‚Äù.

Built to serve the Spanish military, the church was founded by Father Jun√≠pero Serra, O.F.M., who celebrated Santa Barbara's first Mass at the original site of the Presidio Chapel and had initially supplied all of the furnishings, altar pieces, and a library. On July 29, 1855, the first church building was consecrated. Initially located at northeast corner of State Street and Figueroa Street, the church was primarily constructed by the students of the nearby seminary college known as the Apostolic College of Our Lady of Sorrows.

The species was named and described by the Russian entomologist Andrey I. Khalaim. The description was published in a 2017 open access article co-authored with Mexican entomologist Enrique Ru√≠z-Cancino.  Etymology  Andrey I. Khalaim, an entomologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, chose the specific name elbakyanae to honor Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan \\"in recognition of her contribution to making scientific knowledge available for all researchers\\". Elbakyan took offense to being the namesake of a \\"parasitic insect\\"; this in part led to her closing Russian access to Sci-Hub temporarily. In a message which appeared when Russians attempted to visit Sci-Hub, she said that it was an \\"extreme injustice\\" to have the wasp named after her. Khalaim was surprised by her reaction, emphasizing he intended it to be an honor. He said he approves of Sci-Hub and regularly uses it himself. He also clarified that, as parasitoids kill their hosts, it should be more thought of as a predatory wasp, than a parasite.  Taxonomic history  The type series comprised a female holotype and four male paratypes, all collected in 2016. The holotype and one paratype were deposited at National Autonomous University of Mexico; the other three paratypes were deposited at the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas, the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Natural History Museum, London.  Distribution  It is found in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. The type locality, where all specimens in the type series were found, is in Nanacamilpa de Mariano Arista. The specimens were all caught in forest of pine and oak trees; the collection site was at an elevation of .  Description  I. elbakyanae has a black face and mandibles which get narrower apically.

A larger portion of district was previously declared a histo-cultural heritage/overlay zone by the city government of Manila in 2011. Among the heritage structures in the zone is the Lichauco Heritage House, a residential building that was declared a heritage house by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on July 10, 2010, and the Santa Ana Church, which houses two National Cultural Treasures declared by the National Museum of the Philippines: the Camar√≠n de la Virgen, a chapel room located behind the church altar which contains the oldest dateable oil paintings in the country, and the Santa Ana Site Museum, which contains archaeological objects discovered by excavations conducted by the National Museum in 1966.  Heritage designation  Owing to its historic nature and archaeological value, the city council of Manila passed Ordinance no. 8244 on September 22, 2011, declaring a portion of Santa Ana a histo- cultural heritage/overlay zone (O-HCH). This zone is bounded by Philippine National Railways on the north, Pasig River on the east, Del Pan Street on the south, Tejeron Street on the southwest, and Carreon Street on the west. This declaration by the city government is a requirement for it to be declared a heritage zone by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. On May 12, 2014, the Board of the NHCP approved Resolution No. 01, S. 2014, which declared a smaller portion of Santa Ana a heritage zone, under the provisions of Republic Act No. 10066, or the National Cultural Heritage Act. Among the many reasons mentioned by the NHCP in support of its declaration is the historicity of the area as the site where Lakan Tagkan ruled (see Namayan), the location of Panday Pira's foundry for cannon-making, the Santa Ana Church, and various other structures, including Jesuit retreat houses, a Taoist temple, and a sacred well.  Issues  In 2013, a real estate developer started excavation works for the construction of a residential condominium tower within the histo-cultural heritage/overlay zone. The National Museum claimed that the developer did not perform an Archaeological Impact Assessment (AIA) which is required by the National Cultural Heritage Act while a local heritage group tried to stop the excavation. The site was inspected in 2014 which uncovered damaged pieces of pottery and other artifacts.

History The Southern Yorke's Peninsula Pioneer was first published on 21 January 1898, and sold at a discounted price due to its late appearance. It was originally owned and established by Ben L. Wilkinson, and later helped by his brother Richard, in Yorketown. In Issue 10, on 25 March that year, the newspaper adopted a simpler title, The Pioneer.

Currently, it is a Michigan registered historic site located in Three Oaks in the U.S. state of Michigan. Originally emplaced on the island of Corregidor, the cannon was captured by the United States Navy in 1898 after the Battle of Manila Bay. The heavy gun was shipped to the United States as a prize of war and used as a competition trophy in a patriotic fundraising drive. After Three Oaks was declared the winner of the contest, the cannon was awarded to the people of Three Oaks. A park close to the center of the town, Dewey Cannon Park, has been landscaped to provide a setting for the massive trophy. Description The Dewey Cannon is a public artifact of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, fought in 1898. This four-month conflict between the United States and Spain, ignited by an explosion involving the armored cruiser USS Maine, ended in a complete victory for the United States. In May 1898, U.S. naval forces entered what was then the Spanish colonial harbor of Manila Bay and subdued its fortifications, including Corregidor Island. The Dewey Cannon was purloined, as a prize of war, soon after this change of possession. The bronze fieldpiece was being used as a defensive decoration for the home of the Spanish colonial governor. As a gun that was at least 30 years old (and obsolete) at the time of its capture, it was useless to Dewey's men. American military forces swiftly refortified Corregidor as part of their drive to make the Philippine Islands into an American colony. =Prize of war= The trophy cannon was renamed in honor of U.S. Commodore George Dewey, and was carried to the United States in November 1898. As a prize of war, it was displayed to curious crowds in the office of the San Francisco Examiner throughout the winter of 1898‚Äì1899. The bronze fieldpiece was then handed over to the National Monument Committee of New York, a philanthropic organization, for what was to be the focus of a national promotion and fundraising drive. The Maine explosion had killed or fatally injured 266 U.S. sailors, and authorities sought to develop a suitable memorial to the dead through a public-private partnership that would involve the active participation of both men and women. The federal government agreed to set aside a suitable space at Arlington National Cemetery to serve as a final resting place for many of the men, and the National Monument Committee set to work to raise funds to build what would become the USS Maine Mast Memorial. Three Oaks contributed $1,400, . The town was declared to have raised more money, per capita, than any other community in the U.S. The rural community also offered to set aside a square-block park space as a site for the artifact. Three Oaks was declared the winner of the nationwide competition, and President William McKinley visited the community on October 17, 1899 to dedicate Dewey Cannon Park. Lead fundraiser Helen Miller Gould, daughter of railroad magnate Jay Gould, now took charge. The philanthropist had worked with her fellow New Yorkers on a variety of private-sector efforts to help American Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War wounded and dead. She oversaw the official presentation of the trophy to the people of Three Oaks on June 28, 1900. =Today= Today, the cannon continues to bear the royal monogram of Queen Isabella II of Spain (reigned 1833‚Äì1868). Next to the monogram, an incised inscription sets forth a brief history of the cannon's acquisition by U.S. forces. A nearby Michigan historical marker continues the story. The cannon is Michigan Registered Site #S0239. The cannon, now mounted on a circular concrete base, is located in Dewey Cannon Park on Cherry Street in Three Oaks, Michigan. It is mounted so that its muzzle points westward, facing weekend visitors from nearby Chicago. Its coordinates are .

In September 1420, the first year of the Hussite Wars, the Prague Hussites, led by Hynek Kru≈°ina of Lichtenburg, besieged Vy≈°ehrad castle, which was held by Czech and German Imperial knights. They established a military camp on a nearby hill and engaged in artillery duels with the Vy≈°ehrad garrison. Imperial troops from nearby Hradcany Castle fired into the Old Town of Prague in support of the besieged Vy≈°ehrad garrison. The Prague Hussites sent out a call for aid, which resulted in thousands of Hussite reinforcements coming from Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Louny, and ≈Ωatec. However, T√°bor, the home of the Taborites, a Radical Hussite faction, only sent forty horsemen. The Prague Hussites then completely surrounded the castle except for the cliffside by the river, which forced the garrison to agree to surrender if their lack of supplies persisted and Emperor Sigismund did not arrive to relieve them by October 31, 9 AM. Sigismund arrived at noon, October 31 and found that the castle had already surrendered. He initiated the Battle of Vy≈°ehrad, in which his forces were defeated. Radical Hussite priests called for the Imperial corpses to rot on the field for three days, but the army of the Prague Hussites ignored it. The castle was sacked and on June 21, 1421, Hradcany Castle was also taken by the Prague Hussites and similarly ransacked. The Prague Hussites included primarily Bohemian nobility and merchants as opposed to the Taborites and Orebites, who included many peasants and lower-class clergy. During Hussite Wars, Prague Hussites tried to unite Hussite groups and reestablish the Christian church in Bohemia, but this effort was hindered by the Taborites who gained control of communities in southern Bohemia.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of six resources, including three contributing buildings, one contributing site, and two non-contributing buildings. with Beginning in the mid-19th century county homes were established across the state to take care of less fortunate residents. That care then extended to the end of the 20th century. The Hardin County Home operated at this location from 1877 to 1996. The historic district encompasses the buildings, farm fields, and cemetery associated with the home. The first burial in the cemetery, located on the southwest corner of the property, was in 1877. The graves are marked with simple stone markers. The last burial was in 2008. Farm fields surround the buildings and extend to the north. The original home was destroyed in an April 1924 fire. Des Moines architect Willfred Holtzman, Jr. designed a three-story, brick, Neoclassical building to replace it. The T-plan structure was completed in 1927 when the funds became available to complete it. This is the only county home in Iowa that is known to be built in the 1920s. It was expanded in 1953 with a two-story addition in that follows the Modern Movement. A new barn had been completed two years prior. A hollow tile block pump house, built either in the 1920s or in the 1950s, is the third contributing building. The non-contributing buildings include a shelter house (c. 1975), used for outdoor events, and a machine/equipment shed (c. 1977). In the second half of the 20th century, the home became more of a nursing home, and it served that purpose until it closed in 1996. The residents at that time were moved into Eldora.

He was responsible for conquering Attock on the banks of the Indus and repelling the Durrani ruler, Ahmad Shah Abdali out of India in the 1750s.  Campaigns with Peshwa Bajirao I  At the age of 17 years, Sakharam Hari Gupte joined the army of Peshwa Bajirao 1 alongside his brother Baburao Gupte. In 1735, when he joined the Peshwa's army, during the battle against \\"Siddhi Rahiman\\"; Sakharam Hari stood across him and killed him on the spot. As a felicitation gesture, Bajirao 1 gave him the same elephant used by Siddhi Rahiman and also made him the commander of a cavalry of 1200 horsemen.

Sakharam Hari Gupte faked a retreat and then surrounded a hill that was empty from both sides. He then attacked from there resulting in victory for the Peshwa and maratha army. Peshwa Bajirao 1 made him his tipnis (secretary) and till the time of his death, he assigned him various tasks to be fulfilled at Ajinkyatara.  Rise to Power  During the reign of Peshwa Bajirao 1, Sakharam Hari Gupte enjoyed respect at Chhatrapati Shahu 1's Ajinkyatara fort. Sakharam Hari Gupte was married to Avabai Korde/Kohlatkar who was the elder sister of Parvatibai Korde/Kolhatkar. Sakharam Hari Gupte had become very close to both Peshwa Bajirao 1's family namely to Chimaji Appasaheb and Nanasaheb as well as Chhatrapati Shahu. He had become a trusted name in the maratha royal circles. Once when a 3 year old Parvatibai accompanied him to Chhatrapati Shahu's court, the Maratha ruler was impressed by her sharp intellect and enthusiasm. He adopted the young Parvatibai and decided to train her in administration and warfare. The maratha ruler also suggested Parvatibai's proposal for Chimaji Appasaheb's 7 year old son, Sadashivrao. Since, everyone was impressed by Parvatibai and Sakharam Hari Gupte, a man was sent to the latter's household in Nashik to seek the girl's hand. But the man reported back to Chimaji Appa that the girl was too talkative. Also, the alliance couldn't take place as the Chhatrapati Shahu 1 wanted someone to finance the next mohim so he got Sadashivrao married to Umabai Mehendale who was affluent. After, Umabai's death Sadashivrao was married to Parvatibai, likewise, Chhatrapati Shahu-1 who had a secular approach fixed Radhikabai's marriage to Vishwasrao On gudi padwa day, Vishwasrao (8 years old) and Radhikabai (4 years old) were engaged to each other.  Fall from Power  After the death of Peshwa Madhavrao-1, Nana Fadnavis and Gopikabai gained more power with the rise of next Peshwa, Narayanrao. Gopikabai and Nana Fadnavis instructed Narayanrao to lay restrictions on the CKP caste. Narayanrao, also insulted Sardar Gupte who had gone to his court on behalf of the Prabhu caste to void the restrictions. Later, Tuloji Pawar, Sakharam Bapu Bokil and Raghunathrao hatched the plot to kill Narayanrao. Sardar Gupte was also accused of the same. Few months after the death of Narayanrao, Nana Fadnavis offered Sakharam Bapu Bokil to join the Barbai financial council. He accepted the offer. But restrictions on Sardar Gupte and his family as well as the prabhus of Pen were continued. After, Gopikabai's death in Nashik, Sardar Gupte was arrested by deception.

Life  Die Einquartierung (\\"Occupying New Quarters\\") (c. 1890) Julius Adam was a member of the important Adam family of Munich artists. His grandfather was Albrecht Adam, his uncles were Benno, Franz and Eugen Adam, and his cousin Emil Adam, all painters. His father, also called Julius Adam (1821‚Äì1874), was primarily a lithographer and photographer. At first Adam (the son) was occupied with landscape photography and worked for his father's business in Rio de Janeiro but later returned to Munich and settled down as a genre painter. Initially Adam was a pupil of Prof. Michael Echter (1812‚Äì1879), later of Wilhelm von Diez (1839‚Äì1907) at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Munich. He began producing his successful cat pictures in 1882, the international popularity of which caused the high quality of his other work to be somewhat overlooked.

It was proclaimed in 1851 by Governor Henry Young and was named for the former Surveyor-General of South Australia, Edward Charles Frome. The iconic Mount Remarkable in the Hundred of Gregory is at the centre of the county. Local government The earliest local government to be formed in the county was the Corporate Town of Port Augusta, established at Port Augusta in 1875. The adjacent Corporate Town of Davenport was established at Davenport in 1887. The District Council of Davenport was established shortly after in 1888 at Stirling North, under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887, but was renamed Woolundunga in 1893 to avoid confusion with the adjacent corporate town. The District Council of Wilmington and District Council of Port Germein were established at Wilmington and Port Germein, respectively, by the same 1887 legislation. In 1932, the Corporated Town of Davenport was annexed by Port Augusta. Wilmington had been renamed Hammond in 1893 but the name was restored when it absorbed much of the abolished Woolundunga in 1933. That same year, the northerly- adjacent District Council of Kanyaka, also established in 1888, occupied a small north portion of the county when it annexed part of the former Woolundunga council area in the hundreds of Woolundunga and Willochra. In 1964 Port Augusta obtained city status and became known as the City of Port Augusta. In 1969 Kanyaka council amalgamated with the Corporate Town of Quorn to form the new District Council of Kanyaka-Quorn. This portion of the county was transferred to the Flinders Ranges Council in 1997 when Kanyaka-Quorn was abolished bt amalgamation with the District Council of Hawker. In 1980, Port Germein and Wilmington amalgamated to form the present District Council of Mount Remarkable which presently spans almost all of the county, with the exception of the industrial centre of Port Augusta which has remained continuously viable beside coast in the north west corner of the county.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 November 2014. Richardson previously appeared in the show in the early 90s. Following his first stint as Gary, Richardson reprised the role in late 2015 and returned the following year. Gary is portrayed as an easy-going, work shy bogan. He was introduced as the estranged father of Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), and his early storylines focused on his attempts to reconnect with his family. After accepting money from Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) to beat Ezra Hanley (Steve Nation), Gary was sent to prison. A year later, the character was reintroduced, and he was reunited with his mother and teenage daughter. Gary's relationship with Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) has faced several obstacles, including the return of his former partner Brooke Butler (Fifi Box), Terese's cancer diagnosis and infidelity. Others storylines have seen Gary arrested for assault, a feud with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), and financial difficulties. The character was killed off on 20 March 2020. Bridget McManus from The Sydney Morning Herald has praised Richardson in the role, but thought he was \\"underutilised\\", while other critics have expressed their sympathy for Gary. Casting On 15 October 2014, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that the estranged father of established character Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), would soon be introduced for a guest stint. Kilkelly confirmed that the character's scenes had already been filmed and his presence would \\"shake up life for the popular Canning family.\\" Richardson's casting as Gary was announced on 3 November. He had previously appeared in Neighbours in the guest role of Kim White in the early 90s. Development =Characterisation and early storylines= The official website describes Gary as being \\"an easy-going likeable bloke who enjoys nothing more than lazy afternoons at the pub with a few mates, or long days with a fishing rod at some quiet spot.\\" Gary also enjoys getting to know new people, and often uses his sense of humour to ease tense social situations. Although he is skilled as a handyman, Gary dislikes hardwork and will try to take short cuts to make easy money. In 2016, Gary takes up pigeon racing as a hobby. Richardson joked that the birds were great to work with. He also said Gary was doing his best to stay out of prison, saying that for now, \\"Gary's on the straight and narrow\\". In his fictional backstory, Gary walked out on his family when Kyle was only eight years old, and he did not see or speak to his son for sixteen years. When Gary asks his mother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) for money, Kyle's wife Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) contacts him and asks that he visit Kyle, who has longed for a relationship with his father. Milligan explained that if he was in Kyle's shoes he would want answers as to why Gary left the family and did not attempt to contact him. When Gary and Kyle come face-to-face, Kyle is not sure if he should hit or hug his father. Milligan explained, \\"Kyle has really wanted his dad to come back and be part of his life for so long, but when he does, he doesn't know how he is feeling or how to react with his emotions. It's going to be a bit of a shake-up, but hopefully it works out for them!\\" Milligan praised Richardson's casting, believing that his portrayal of Gary showed viewers where Kyle inherited his \\"bogan and larrikin attitude from\\". He added that there were a few similarities between Gary and Kyle, like their stupidity and their jobs as handymen, which made them \\"a great father-son mix\\". As well as Kyle and Sheila, Gary is also reunited with his sister Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly). Naomi tires of Sheila's \\"blatant favouritism\\" of Gary, and tries to get him to reveal an event from his \\"dark past\\" that they both know about. It soon emerges that Gary carried out an assault on Ezra Hanley (Steve Nation) in exchange for money from Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). As Gary prepares to leave town, Sheila confronts him and asks him to give himself up to the police, but Gary flees the house. Sheila suffers a heart attack, which Naomi initially blames herself for causing. But when Gary arrives at the hospital, he soon admits that he and Sheila had a big argument after she learned that he attacked Ezra. Naomi is \\"furious\\" with her brother, so she tells Kyle that the real reason Gary walked out on his family all those years ago was because he took part in a robbery and went on the run. A devastated Kyle then calls the police on his father. Shortly before Gary is taken to jail, Sheila comes to visit him at the police station. She blames herself for how he has turned out, but Gary assures her that she is a great mother. Gary is \\"delighted\\" when Kyle eventually walks in and they say their goodbyes. =Reintroduction= In October 2015, Mann hinted that a member of the Canning family would be returning to the show. The following day, it was confirmed that Richardson had reprised the role of Gary and had returned to filming, with Gary's return set to air in early 2016. Ahead of his reappearance, Gary's teenage daughter Xanthe Canning (Lily Van der Meer) was introduced. Xanthe was unaware that her father was in prison when she arrived in Erinsborough. When Kyle rejects a visiting order from Gary, Xanthe asks Sheila to take her to the jail to see him instead. Things are initially awkward, but Xanthe is delighted to be reunited with her father. Gary then reveals that he could be getting out of prison soon, and Sheila invites him to live with them once he is released. When Kyle learns of the invitation, he visits Gary and explains his concerns for Xanthe, who he feels needs people in her life who are going to stay around and look after her. Sheila is soon informed that Gary has been involved in a fight with another inmate and his parole will no longer be processed, leading her to realise that Gary started the fight on purpose. Gary returned on 14 June 2016. He shows up in the prison yard just as Paul Robinson is close to being beaten up by the other inmates, who want protection money from him. Dennis called it \\"an interesting twist\\" as it seems Gary is coming to his rescue, while Paul is the reason Gary is in prison in the first place. He continued, \\"They have a strained relationship, so I don't know if Gary will want to help Paul...\\" Paul asks for Gary's help in keeping him safe, but Gary does not want to, so Paul tries to con him and Sheila into helping. Gary later has \\"a confusing conversation\\" with Paul, that leads Paul to think that Gary has got his back. However, Gary refuses to help Paul, as he has just been granted parole. Paul later ends up in the hospital after being badly assaulted. Richardson wanted to explore Gary and Paul's time in prison further, and thought it would have been fun if they were put in the same cell. A couple of months after Gary returns home, Xanthe accuses her classmate Cooper Knights (Charlie Hannaford) of sexually assaulting her. Cooper is later attacked and Gary becomes the prime suspect, which later leads to his arrest. Richardson admitted that Gary was \\"definitely capable\\" of committing the attack, going by his history. Richardson told an Inside Soap writer, \\"He's very frustrated with the way the school is dealing with the issue, and he thinks he can handle it in a much more immediate way.\\" Despite having an alibi from Paul for the time of Cooper's attack, it soon emerges that Cooper was assaulted 15 minutes earlier than the police first thought, meaning Gary is back on top of their suspects list. Richardson explained that all the evidence points toward Gary, and if he is found guilty then his parole will be revoked and he will go back to prison. The actor added, \\"things are looking very bleak indeed at this point.\\" Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard) later learns that it was Cooper's mother who attacked him, and Xanthe is grateful to him for saving Gary from returning to prison. =Relationship with Terese Willis= In August 2016, Gary was romantically paired with Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). Gary begins interacting with Terese more when he is paid by Paul to steal her strategy file for the upcoming sale of Lassiters Hotel. Gary goes along with Paul's plan, as he is cash-strapped. Gary soon develops feelings for Terese, and Richardson thought Gary was \\"batting well above his average\\". He explained, \\"Any man that thinks he has the chance of attracting a woman out of his league; you know it's hard to say no. She represents someone who Gary wouldn't have seen himself being with. I mean she owns something. She's corporate.\\" The actor also said Gary feels bad about lying and deceiving Terese, but he has found himself in an awkward situation. Gary has been forced into choosing \\"the wrong course of action.\\" Gary wins a pigeon race organised by Terese and uses the prize money to clear his debt with Paul. Terese later offers him a job at the hotel, but rescinds the offer when Gary's pigeon is disqualified for doping. Xanthe later admits that she accidentally drugged the bird, which Terese finds amusing and she \\"spontaneously\\" asks Gary out to dinner. However, Gary becomes involved in a family matter and stands Terese up, leaving Paul to take his place. In 2016, Gary ends his relationship with Terese to reconcile with his former partner Brooke Butler, played by Fifi Box (pictured). Gary and Terese continue to get closer, and Sheila attempts to give him advice on how to win Terese over. Instead, Gary bonds with Terese over parental challenges and she invites him to have coffee with her. Gary tells Terese how he would seduce and kiss her, which gets Terese \\"all hot and bothered.\\" But she worries about Gary's past and her reputation, and decides that their relationship should stay professional. However, she later kisses him, and he kisses her back. Terese is adamant their relationship should stay a secret and Gary agrees to respect her wishes. When Terese learns the man who was responsible for her son's death has been released from jail, she turns to Gary for support. They soon share a kiss, which Paul witnesses. Shortly before the Canning family's appearance on Family Feud, Xanthe accidentally reveals that Gary is dating Terese. An argument between Sheila and Gary plays out in front of the cameras. Sheila is \\"furious\\" with the news, as Terese is her boss. Not long after, Xanthe's mother Brooke Butler (Fifi Box) comes to Erinsborough. She grows jealous of Gary's relationship with Terese, and she pretends that she still has feelings for Gary. Gary reconciles with Brooke, but Xanthe suspects that her mother is planning on scamming him. She warns her father, but Gary assures her that he would know if Brooke was planning on conning him. Brooke later persuades Gary to give her his Family Feud winnings by claiming the jewellery she has sold to the neighbours is being held at Customs. Brooke leaves town when it emerges that the jewellery she sold was fake. Gary and Terese get back together, but their relationship is threatened by Brooke's reappearance. Terese is \\"horrified\\" when the Cannings allow Brooke to stay with them. She soon suspects that Gary is cheating on her when she notices their secretive conversations. Gary explains that he is trying to help Brooke reunite with her daughter Jessie, but Terese feels she cannot trust him and ends their relationship. A love triangle develops when Brooke realises she loves Gary, but Gary insists that he loves Terese. Brooke then encourages Gary to propose to Terese, believing that she will reject him and Gary will give up on their relationship. Brooke's plan backfires when Gary and Terese reconcile, and Terese accepts Gary's proposal. Gary and Terese's relationship is strained when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. Terese initially keeps her diagnosis and treatment from Gary and her daughter, Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel). Gary becomes concerned about her odd behaviour and suspects she is either pregnant or has relapsed into alcoholism, until Terese tells him and Piper about her diagnosis. Elmaloglou said Gary becomes \\"very supportive\\" during Terese's treatment. Gary seeks alternative treatments for Terese when her chemotherapy fails, and he later asks her incarcerated brother Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou) for his help. When Terese learns that her tumours have shrunk, she tells Paul first and they have sex. She returns home to a surprise engagement party organised by Gary. Elmaloglou told Johnathon Hughes of the Radio Times that Terese and Paul have \\"a shared, spontaneous moment\\", but she does feel guilty about cheating on Gary. Elmaloglou added, \\"She knows how much Gary loves her and, despite what she's just done, she loves Gary too.\\" The actress wanted Terese to marry Gary and gain some stability in her life. During their wedding ceremony, Terese admits to Gary that she cheated on him with Paul. Elmaloglou commented that Gary is \\"absolutely devastated and in shock. And he's angry, too...\\" Gary returns to work, but finds that the Lassiters Hotel staff are gossiping about his failed wedding to Terese. Gary is later asked to throw away a couch from Terese's office and Paul reveals that it is the couch that he and Terese had sex on. On the advice on his co-worker, Gary decides to get revenge on Terese by publicly humiliating her at the Lassiters complex re- opening ceremony. He places the couch in the middle of the new walkway and writes \\"Cheater\\" on it. =Feud and debt= Following Brooke's departure, Gary begins feuding with neighbour Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), who bought some of the fake jewellery from Brooke. The Canning and Kennedy families sit down together to sort out their issues. Karl's wife Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) suggests that they should move on and forget about the money, but Gary insists that he will pay them back despite having no money. Needing to get out of debt, Gary meets with ex-con Kev McNally (Troy Davis) and arranges to carry out some illegal jobs for him. Gary's first job is to move some stolen goods from a car, but he soon finds the car has gone missing. Gary turns to Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns) for help and he eventually finds the car, but it is empty. Gary later accidentally attacks Karl, thinking it was Kev. He tells Sheila that he is in debt and realising that she knows Kev's father, Sheila decides to seduce him to rectify the situation. =Departure= The character was killed off during the show's 35th anniversary episodes on 20 March 2020. Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) confirmed that Richardson had left the cast and would be removed from the show's opening titles the following week. Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) shoots Gary with a bow and arrow, as he attempts to rescue Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan) and Bea Nilsson (Bonnie Anderson), who are being held hostage by Finn in a mineshaft. In the aftermath, Kyle is left to inform Sheila, who demands that Gary's autopsy is fast-tracked in order to bring her closure. Storylines Gary contacts his mother Sheila Canning and asks for money. Sheila tries to persuade Gary to visit his son Kyle, but he refuses. However, he changes his mind when Kyle's wife Georgia begs him not to walk away from his son. Gary and Kyle initially struggle to bond. Gary explains that he left his family to protect them, after he witnessed a robbery and was seen by the perpetrators. Gary decides to stay around and he helps Kyle out with his handyman business. Gary and his sister Naomi agree not to tell Kyle that they have been meeting up over the years. One day, Gary leaves Kyle's toolbox unlocked and someone steals the tools. He tries to buy some second-hand tools to help Kyle, before getting a job to compensate his son. Paul Robinson pays Gary to beat up Ezra Hanley. Sheila sees Gary taking payment from Paul and confronts him. She urges her son to turn himself in, but he leaves. Gary later hears that Sheila has had a heart attack and he goes to the hospital, where he admits that it is his fault Sheila is ill. Naomi then tells Kyle that Gary walked out on him as he was actually the getaway driver in the robbery. Kyle reports Gary to the police. Gary also confesses that Paul paid him to assault Ezra. After Paul is questioned, he pays Gary to change his story. Gary offers the money to Kyle and Naomi, but they refuse to take it. Before Gary is taken to jail, Sheila and Kyle visit him to say their goodbyes. A year later, Gary sends a visiting order to Kyle, but Sheila and his newly arrived, teenage daughter Xanthe come instead. Gary reveals that he is eligible for parole. After Kyle asks Gary not to let Xanthe down when he gets out, Gary deliberately gets into a fight and his parole is revoked. Months later, Gary encounters Paul in the prison yard. Paul asks Gary for protection and later begs Gary for help when the other inmates threaten to beat him, but Gary refuses as he is being released. At home, Gary finds a missing Xanthe and learns that she took $10,000 from Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger). Gary tells Tom that he will not receive any more repayments, as he believes the money was illegally gained to begin with, since Tom did not report the theft to the police. After Paul is released, Gary apologises for leaving him and Paul gives him a cleaning job at his motel. When Xanthe needs a tutor and a prom dress, Gary struggles financially and he asks ex-con Kev McNally for work. He later decides to get a loan from Paul, who also asks him to spy on his business rival, Terese Willis. Gary is arrested for attacking Cooper Knights, a student who assaulted Xanthe. Ben Kirk soon learns that Cooper's mother was the assailant. Gary enters a pigeon race and wins, but he is disqualified after officials find his bird was doped. Xanthe admits that she gave the pigeon paracetamol. Terese asks Gary on a date. Gary and Terese date in secret, until Xanthe reveals the relationship to Sheila, while the family are on Family Feud. Xanthe's mother Brooke Butler comes to town and Gary reconciles his relationship with her. Brooke makes several jewellery sales and then persuades Gary to give her money, as the jewellery is being held at customs. She soon leaves town and Gary is forced to seek extra work to pay back those who she cheated. Gary feuds with Karl Kennedy, who bought some of the jewellery. He contacts Kev again, who offers him a job moving stolen goods from a car. Gary finds the car is missing and enlists Tyler Brennan's help to find it. After locating the car, Gary discovers it is empty and Kev tells him he now owes $30,000. Sheila speaks with Kev's father, who reveals Kev stole the laptops and set Gary up. Gary and Terese get back together, but shortly after Brooke returns and tries to make amends. Gary offers to help her reconnect with her daughter, Jessie. Their behaviour leads Terese to think Gary is cheating on her and she ends their relationship. Brooke persuades Gary to propose to Terese, who accepts. Terese has an allergic reaction to Gary's engagement ring, and he steals a replacement from the hotel's lost property box. After noticing Terese exhibiting odd behaviour, Gary thinks she is either pregnant or drinking again, but she admits that she has breast cancer. Gary is supportive and tries to convince Terese to cut back on her work hours. When her treatment fails to work, Gary seeks out alternatives and approaches her brother, and former oncologist, Nick Petrides in prison. When Paul and Gary argue over Terese's new treatment, Gary learns that Terese told Paul about her diagnosis before him. Gary accidentally tells Terese's boss Jasmine Udagawa (Kaori Maeda-Judge) about her cancer, leading the Udagawas to withdraw their investment. Gary arranges a surprise engagement party for Terese. He later interviews for a chefs job at a local restaurant, but John Rotondo (Vincent Gorceis) turns him down. After John offers him an illegal oyster-fishing job, Gary follows him to Lassiters and realises Paul tried to set him up. On their wedding day, Terese pulls Gary aside and confesses to having sex with Paul. Days later, Gary returns to work and his colleague tells him to get revenge. While moving a couch from Terese's office, Paul tells Gary he and Terese had sex on it. Gary places the couch in the middle of Lassiters with the word \\"Cheater\\" painted on it to humiliate Terese. While he is in The Waterhole, Gary is propositioned by Caro Watts (Janine Atwill), who gives him her hotel key card. He later reassures Terese that nothing happened with Caro. Gary is rushed to hospital after he inhales toxic fumes from cleaning fluid. When Terese visits him, he tells her he wants to give their relationship another go. Hamish Roche's (Sean Taylor) body is found in the Cannings spa, and Gary and Sheila becomes suspects in his murder. Gary asks Paul for an alibi and Paul agrees, but only if Gary breaks up with Terese. Gary and Sheila realise that they thought each other had killed Hamish, but neither of them did. Gary tells the police that he cleaned up the crime scene and is charged with obstruction of justice. Terese forgives Gary for going to Paul for help instead of her, and they go on a camping trip. She later offers him a trial in the Lassiters kitchen, but he annoys the head chef by making several mistakes. Gary enrols in a TAFE course to qualify as a chef. After catering for the launch of The Flametree Retreat, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) offers Gary a job. Gary learns that Xanthe and Ben are in a sexual relationship. When Gary sees them together at the hotel, he uses his master key to enter a room to stop them. But he ends up scaring hotel guest Levi Jansen (Sam Allen), who cancels a meeting with Shane Rebecchi (Nicholas Coghlan). Terese bars Gary from the hotel, while Shane confronts him in the street and breaks his fishing pole. Gary and Terese get back together, but he suspects that she still has feelings for Paul. Gary suspicions grow when he learns that Terese has engineered a reason for him to be delayed at work. He later finds Terese on the Lassiters mezzanine, where she proposes to him and he accepts. While they are spending a night at the hotel, Gary finds Terese and Paul together in her office for a phone call. Gary decides to end the relationship. He later accompanies Terese for her post-cancer check-up, telling her he will always support her. Steph gives Gary a trial as manager of the retreat, but reconsiders when Xanthe and Piper have their drinks spiked at a party. Sheila urges her to keep Gary on and Steph agrees. Fay Brennan (Zoe Bertram) asks Gary on a date. Sheila encourages him to accept, as she suspects Fay is laundering money through The Waterhole and needs evidence. Gary learns Fay is not doing anything illegal, but he humiliates her when she overhears him telling Sheila that he is not interested in dating her. Xanthe is deliberately struck by Elly Conway's (Jodi Anasta) car. Gary initially blames Elly for Xanthe's injuries, but Xanthe later confirms that Finn Kelly was driving, so Gary goes to his apartment and trashes it. Gary meets with Finn's former cellmate Jeremy Sluggett (Tamblyn Lord) to ask for his whereabouts. Jeremy promises to give Gary the information, as long as Gary holds onto $100,000 for him for a week. They arrange for Jeremy to pick up the money from the retreat, but Gary's new employee Sindi Watts (Marisa Warrington) turns up unexpectedly and Jeremy knocks her unconscious. Jeremy is arrested and the money is returned to Gary, who uses some of it to fund Xanthe's medical treatments. Gary considers using Jeremy's money to help Xanthe pay for a private university. He asks for a bank loan instead, and he secures one when Steph gives him a new contract and a pay rise. Gary admits to Xanthe that he is lonely, and that he has feelings for Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). After learning that the loan will not come through for two weeks, Gary uses Jeremy's money for Xanthe's university fees, intending to replace it with the loan. However, after one of Steph's friends see him fighting with Shane, Steph rescinds his pay rise and the bank cancel the loan. Jeremy's mother Nance Sluggett (Denise Drysdale) comes to collect his money, but deduces that Gary does not have it. She asks him for free treatments and then a job in return for derailing Jeremy's parole hearing. However, when she clashes with Sheila, Nance cancels the deal. Gary tells his family and Amy about his situation, and Amy gifts him the money to pay Nance. Gary then declares his love for Amy, who breaks up with her boyfriend Rob Carson (Christopher Farrell) to be with him. Steph fires Gary after learning the truth about his deal with Jeremy, while Paul refuses to accept Gary and Amy's relationship, leading Amy to move in with Gary. Paul uses to Jeremy to try and set Gary up, but Gary realises what is happening and goads Paul, who punches him. Terese hires Gary as a barista at the pavilion coffee hut and he delivers stolen goods for Kev McNally to pay Amy back faster. He later discovers that he is moving solar converters stolen from Amy's Robinson Heights project. Kev agrees to let Gary quit if he retrieves a remote that was left behind at the site. Sheila catches Gary with the remote and he asks that she keeps it from Amy. Kev asks Gary to do another job, but Gary turns it down and Kev has some of the stolen converters placed in the coffee hut. Gary returns later that night to move them, but when he sees someone near the hut, he grabs them and throws them against the building. He soon realises he has attacked Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal), who is left bruised and concussed. Shane vents his anger at Gary, while Amy learns the truth about the robbery and stolen converters in the coffee hut. She helps Sheila get rid of them and then breaks up with Gary. Gary is encouraged to change his life around. He convinces Xanthe to leave Erinsborough to pursue her studies in Toowoomba or everything he did will have been for nothing. He apologises to Dipi properly and they bond over recipes, angering Shane and leading Sheila to suspect they are having an affair. They make it clear that they are just friends, and Gary focuses on trying to find and job and reconciling with Amy. Toadie gives Gary some work at the garden nursery and he gets a job in a warehouse, but he struggles to remember the instructions given to him due to tiredness and is knocked unconscious by some falling boxes. Amy finds Gary and he recovers in hospital. Amy admits that she wants to get back together, but only if Gary tells Sheila to back off, which he does. Gary proposes to Amy, but they are interrupted by Kyle who has returned to Erinsborough to take over Amy's former job at the Robinson Pines development. Amy accepts Gary's proposal and moves back in with him and Sheila. Gary reads out Xanthe's statement at Finn's sentencing hearing and is sure that he will be sent to prison, however, Finn is released into the Kennedys' care, causing tension between them and the Cannings. After learning that Kyle is in love with Amy, Gary arranges a secret wedding, but Amy shuts it down. After a short break away, Amy returns and tells Gary that their engagement is still on. Gary and Kyle put in a tender for Karl's tram business. Karl chooses them both, forcing them to work together to turn the tram into a restaurant. Gary becomes competitive with Kyle, and fails to secure some scaffolding correctly, resulting in Kyle falling to the ground and straining their relationship. Gary suspects that Kyle and Amy have feelings for each other, leading him to agree to try for a baby with Amy. However, Amy overhears Gary admitting that he does not want another child, and she realises that she is content with the life she has with him. Gary learns that Sheila and Paul teamed up to split him and Amy up. He struggles to forgive Sheila and vents his anger at Paul, who is attacked later that night, leaving Gary as the prime suspect. Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson) tells the police that she saw Gary attack Paul, leading to his arrest. The charges are dropped when it emerges that Vance Abernethy (Conrad Coleby) attacked Paul. Gary realises Amy is in love with Kyle and he ends their relationship. Gary later goes on dates with two of Paul's former wives; Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) and Gail Lewis (Fiona Corke). Gary then meets and bonds with Prudence Wallace (Denise van Outen) at The Waterhole. Gary and Prue go on a few dates, until Prue's daughter Harlow Robinson warns Gary away. Harlow later apologises and Gary and Prue arrange another date. As Prue waits for Gary to finish work, he catches her attempting to take money from the tram's till. Prue reveals she is part of an organisation called the Restoration Order, but she cannot afford to pay her monthly fee. Gary loans Prue the money on the condition she tells him more about the Order. When Prue has to go back to England, Gary and Amy realise that she has deceived Harlow and is planning on bringing her into the Order. Gary and Paul find Harlow at a milk bar, where Prue left her, and bring her home. Gary later tells Harlow that although Prue left, she does love her and shows her a video of them dancing together. Gary and Dipi start spending more time together after her marriage becomes strained, and Shane tries to insert himself into their friendship. After Dipi learns Roxy kissed Shane, she moves in with Gary and Sheila. Gary is wary about how close he and Dipi are becoming, but she reassures him that she values their friendship. Dipi later kisses Gary and Shane learns about it from Karl. He and Dipi talk through their issues and she moves back home. Gary objects when Finn begins tutoring Harlow, as he is reminded of the situation with Xanthe years earlier. Gary goes to London to look for Prue and get her out of the Order. Prue later joins Gary in Erinsborough and reveals that she has left the Order and that she and Gary are engaged. Despite opposition from their families, Terese arranges for Prue and Gary to get married at the Lassiters wedding expo the following week. On his wedding day, Gary learns that Prue did not leave the Order for him, but rather she was kicked out. He tells her he cannot marry her and heads to Pierce Greyson's (Tim Robards) island glamping retreat to make amends with Kyle. While there, he becomes suspicious of Finn's increasingly erratic behaviour. After learning that Harlow is missing on the island, Gary joins in the search and finds her and Bea Nilsson trapped in a mineshaft. He attempts to save them by throwing down a rope, but Finn fatally shoots him in the back with an arrow. Finn then drags his body away, and it is discovered by Elly while she is fleeing from Finn. Kyle is then forced to break the news to an equally devastated Sheila and Xanthe, and his funeral is held a week later. Reception Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy branded Gary \\"troublesome\\". Bridget McManus of The Sydney Morning Herald thought Richardson was \\"underutilised\\" in the role. She also thought the plot in which Gary gets involved with Kev and the stolen car was reminiscent of the television crime series Underbelly. McManus later wrote that although Richardson was convincing as a detective in his former roles, he has \\"the sort of furtive look that lends itself much more comfortably to roles such as the slightly paranoid ex-con Gary.\\" When Terese learnt she had breast cancer, a South Wales Echo observed \\"If you were battling a life-threatening illness, who would you turn to? Probably not Gary Canning or Paul Robinson, and yet the pair of them end up arguing over Terese's new treatment ‚Äì what's more, Gary is devastated that Paul knew about her cancer diagnosis before he did. Maybe he should take a long look at himself and work out why.\\" The Metro's Katie Baillie expressed her sympathy for Gary when Terese cheated on him, commenting \\"the poor guy doesn't deserve this\\". Baillie added that Gary and Terese's relationship had been \\"rocky to say the least\\". Ahead of Gary and Terese's wedding, a reporter for the Liverpool Echo noted that \\"the path of true love has not been a smooth one for this blushing bride and groom, you can bet that tying the knot will turn out to be rather tumultuous.\\" After the aborted ceremony, a South Wales Echo reporter sympathised with Gary and his revenge plan, commenting \\"After being lied to for months, it's understandable that Gary is feeling angry and hurt. Even Terese although annoyed by his efforts to take revenge in a very public fashion, has to admit that she's brought much of it on herself.\\" References External links * Gary Canning at the Official Neighbours website Neighbours characters Television characters introduced in 2014 Fictional criminals on soap operas Fictional chefs Male characters in television ","title":"Gary Canning"},{"id":"55917064","text":"Rajambal may refer to: * Rajambal (1935 film), a 1935 Indian Tamil-language film * Rajambal (1951 film), a 1951 Indian Tamil-language film * T.

Genes & Development, 17(21), 2648‚Äì2663. http://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1144003 It has been found recently that this activity is actually a deubiquitination of a monoubiquitin that occurs in residue Lys 123 of the H2b histone and the acetylation of the H3 histone. The histone acetylation is mediated by the GCN5 histone acetyl transferase, while the deubiquitinating activity is mediated by a deubiquitinating module (DUBm), which is composed of 4 proteins, Ubp8 ubiquitin hydrolase, Sgf11, Sus1, and Sgf73.Samara, N.

Rutter composed the carol whilst he was an undergraduate at university in 1966 with it being published a year later at the behest of David Willcocks.  History  The \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\" was composed by John Rutter in 1966 when he was 18 and studying as an undergraduate at Clare College at the University of Cambridge. Rutter stated that he believed his inspiration for writing it came from when he sang as a boy soprano during the opera \\"Amahl and the Night Visitors\\" and heard pipe music as the title character headed for Bethlehem with the Biblical Magi. The carol was first performed by the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge conducted by Rutter at a Christmas concert. A few days later, David Willcocks, the director of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, requested a copy of Rutter's manuscript for the \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\" and made calls to EMI for the \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\" to be published in 1967. It was Rutter's first composition to be published. Rutter and Willcocks later formed a publishing partnership and helped to compile the Carols for Choirs series of hymnals from the second edition for the Church of England. Prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, choirs in the Baltic states reportedly circulated photocopies and faxes of the \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\" to be sung as a sign of resistance to Soviet control.  Lyrics and score  The lyrics of the \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\", set after the annunciation to the shepherds, are in third person about a shepherd boy playing pipe music on the way to Bethlehem. The boy later states in the carol that he will perform his music for the baby Jesus when he reaches the stable where the Star of Bethlehem was located. The music is scored for SATB and organ or small orchestra.

The title was inspired by the famed Road Rash series of video games, which feature similar gameplay mechanics. Gameplay Road Rage is set in the open world, fictitious city of Ashen. Players ride around on a motorcycle and are free to explore the city at their leisure. Ashen itself is divided into seven districts, ranging from the downtown core to suburban farmland. Gameplay in Road Rage is composed mostly of standard \\"circuit\\" races, time trials, the performing of stunts and assassinations of rival bikers, all of which and more are encountered throughout the campaign. While racing, players are armed with melee weapons (and firearms in the late game) which may be used to attack opponents. All gameplay and combat takes place entirely on the bike, with players being able to simultaneous accelerate and hit opposing racers with weapons such as baseball bats, hockey sticks, axes and long knives. The motorcycle can be upgraded via cash won from events, with an option to buy improved vehicles, cosmetics and additional weapons as well.https://www.gnarlyguides.com/reviews/road-rage-ps4-review/ The game features both split-screen and online multiplayer alongside the single player campaign. Both modes feature up to four players in events similar to those found in the campaign. Release Originally announced in February, 2016, the game was intended to be released in late 2016, but was pushed back one year to October, 2017. After one more delay, the game officially released on November 14, 2017, in both digital and physical formats, at a budgeted price of USD$29.99 and CAD$39.99. Reception Upon release, Road Rage received overwhelmingly negative reception from professional gaming journalists. The PlayStation 4 version holds a 27 on review aggregator Metacritic, while the Xbox One version holds a 33. Critics cited nearly every aspect of the game as being underwhelming, including the combat, driving, presence of numerous glitches, poor graphics and empty world.

It is named after the date and month it started in the Persian calendar. A series of mass arrests by the Babrak Karmal-led Democratic Republic of Afghanistan triggered protests, rioting and a popular uprising against the government. Alternatively it has been said that the murder of Lieutenant Alexander Vovk, an instructor of the Soviet Komsomol, by an unknown gunman in the city, which led to the killing of civilians by a group of Soviet officers, led to the uprising.https://bolcheknig.ru/en/slovar/zhenshchiny-pogibshie-v-afganskoi- voine-kak-voevali-sovetskie-zhenshchiny-v/ Thousands of civilians, including leftists and Islamists took part. Events Demonstrations were held across the whole city against the Parcham government and against the Soviet occupation. Many residents chanted Allahu Akbar whilst the military fired rockets in the air to silent them. Protesters peacefully marched through streets, chanting religious and anti-Soviet messages. They were asked by security forces' loudspeakers to disperse, but they refused. Security forces then started firing at the protesters, and subsequently Soviet tanks were sent to quell the demonstrators. After six days of unrest, 600 civilians were estimated to have been killed in clashes. It is not clear if the uprising was organized. It has been claimed that various organizations were involved, including the Maoist group Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan (SAMA). Others claim it to have been a spontaneous uprising by the \\"people of Kabul\\". Government forces arrested 200 people on the eve of the revolt, and about 5,000 were arrested in the next few weeks. A number of Khalqists were also arrested, resulting in some residents not daring anymore to rise up. Many of the arrested were disappeared. The leader of SAMA, Abdul Majid Kalakani, was later arrested and executed. The government blamed the uprising on agents from Pakistan, China and the United States. The event further isolated the government from the people. In the coming months, many \\"student uprisings\\" took place at Kabul University and other student institutions between pro-Khalqists, nationalists, anti-Marxists, and Islamic fundamentalists, which also resulted in clashes and arrests.Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982 by Mohammed Kakar References Military history of Afghanistan 1980 in Afghanistan Conflicts in 1980 Cold War rebellions February 1980 events in Asia Rebellions in Afghanistan Maoism in Afghanistan Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War Afghanistan‚ÄìSoviet Union relations ","title":"3 Hoot uprising"},{"id":"55917604","text":"Valentina Gorinevskaya (; 1882 ‚Äì 1953), was a Russian military surgeon and trauma specialist.

Its research arm claims to be the top national advocacy body and largest national not-for-profit dedicated to facilitating and funding research into Multiple Sclerosis for people in Australia living with MS  Founding  MS Research Australia was established in 2004 with Simon McKeon (2011 Australian of the Year, who was himself diagnosed with MS in 2001) as Founding Chair from its inauguration until 2010. McKeon handed over to current Chair Mr Paul Murnane but remains involved as the organisation's patron. Founding CEO, Mr Jeremy Wright, handed over to current CEO, Dr Matthew Miles, in 2013. MS Research Australia was created as an MS-specific national research initiative that sought to harness the strengths of the Australian science community (including neurobiology, immunology, genetics, epidemiology, and social & applied abilities), and provide a unified collaborative approach to MS research.  Progress  The organisation claims that, since its establishment in 2004, over $36.7 million has been awarded to 254 MS research projects across both Australia and New Zealand.  Role in the Global MS Community  MS Research Australia is a managing member of the International Progressive MS Alliance, which focuses on progressive multiple sclerosis. MS Research Australia is a contributor to the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF), based in London, which has over 20 countries as members.  Key Achievements  MS Research Australia claims to have played a key role in several significant breakthroughs in the scientific community's understanding of MS. MS Research Australia provides funding for the Vitamin D MS prevention trial (known as PrevANZ) to test whether Vitamin D supplementation can prevent MS in those who are at risk of developing the disease. The organisation claims this study is a world-first clinical trial that had similar results to an earlier study published in Neurological Research International. The organisation supported the Australian New Zealand MS Genetics Consortium, which in 2009 discovered two of the key risk genes in MS and MS Research Australia claims to have subsequently contributed to the International MS Genetics Consortium that has now discovered over 200 genes that contribute to the risk of developing MS. In 2017, research funded by the organisation discovered a possible molecular pathway (the kynurenine pathway) for MS progression, the activation of which may be involved in MS progression. This pathway has already been implicated in other neurological disorders and further study is ongoing. In the same year, Macquarie University declared that through research enabled by MS Research Australia, \\"one of the early and ongoing supporters of this work,\\" the University discovered the first blood biomarker for MS. The blood test developed by Macquarie University researches can distinguish between relapsing and progressive forms of MS with 85-90% accuracy, and the University claims a clinical blood test could be available within two years.

He is the first Indigenous Australian to win a medal for gallantry, for saving a policeman from drowning. Biography Ayaigar's Albert Medal for Lifesaving Ayaiga was of the Alawa language group in the Roper River region. He worked as a police tracker at Roper Bar Police Station and as a stockman at Nutwood Downs and Hodgson Downs stations. In 1911, Ayaiga saved the life of Mounted Police Constable William Johns during a river crossing. Ayaiga and three other men had been arrested for cattle stealing and was being transported in neck chains by Constable Johns. While attempting to cross the Wilton River, Johns' horse overturned kicking him in the head and knocking him unconscious. Despite the neck chain, Ayaiga quickly rescued Johns, dragging him to safety. Ayaiga then borrowed Johns' horse and rode to Hodgson Downs Station to request help. He was not convicted of cattle stealing. Then on 16 February 1912 he was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King George V at Government House, making him the first Indigenous Australian awarded a medal for gallantry. He was not permitted to keep the medal, which was kept for him by the government to wear on special occasions. He wore the medal in February 1915, while on trial for murder. He was acquitted. In 1940 he ferried supplies and rescued people stranded by the flooded Roper River. Constable Johns' grandson, sculptor Greg Johns, created a sculpture inspired by Ayaiga's story. It is on display at Northern Territory Library. Another of Johns' grandsons is ABC sports broadcaster Charlie King. His medal is held at the National Library of Australia.

He began his career by founding and editing the independent liberal monthly newspaper Mississippi Freelance. He reported and edited for The Charlotte Observer for thirty-four years and has written several books about North Carolina.  Early life  Powell was born in Helena, Arkansas, and grew up in Mississippi in a farming family. He attended the University of Mississippi and majored in accounting before choosing a career in journalism.  Career  After graduating, Powell became a sportswriter at the Jacksonville Journal, and then a journalist for the Delta Democrat-Times in Greenville, Mississippi. In 1969 he co-founded the liberal monthly newspaper Mississippi Freelance with his Delta Democrat-Times colleague Ed Williams. The name of the newspaper was chosen to parody an old newspaper, the Mississippi Free Lance, which had been published by former Mississippi governor and U.S. Senator Theodore G. Bilbo, an ardent white supremacist. The Freelance criticized racism and ineptitude in Mississippi politicians, universities, and particularly the state's Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission. The newspaper's motto was \\"reporting the unreported.\\" The paper's Washington bureau chief was journalist and historian Curtis Wilkie. Mississippi Freelance was published from April 1969 to March 1970. Powell was hired as a feature writer at The Charlotte Observer in 1974 and remained at the newspaper until his retirement 35 years later. At the Charlotte Observer, Powell was known for his profiles of people, his annual ‚ÄúCarolina Follies,‚Äù an end-of-year collection of the absurd, his quizzes about North Carolina, his Milestones, and his 20 Questions. He retired as the paper‚Äôs Forum editor, having reviewed and published more than 50,000 letters to the newspaper. Powell retired from the Charlotte Observer in April 2009. His work as a journalist at the Observer and his time in Charlotte led to a passion for the history and culture of North Carolina. In a newspaper article, Powell cites a particular interest in the conflicts between liberal ideology in Charlotte and conservative forces elsewhere in the state. Powell has published several books about North Carolina, with a focus on lesser-known and off-beat information about the state. His books include On This Day in North Carolina, which shares obscure facts about each day in the state‚Äôs history, The Ultimate North Carolina Quiz Book, and Lew Powell's Carolina Follies: A Nose-Tweaking Look at Life in Two Great and Goofy States. In 2011, he was interviewed in a documentary about Camp Greene, a World War I United States Army facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is a regular contributor to the blog North Carolina Miscellany, a project of the University of North Carolina‚Äôs North Carolina Collection. Personal life Powell lives in Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife, poet, author, and journalist Dannye Romine Powell. In a 2012 newspaper article about his hobby of collecting North Carolina artifacts and documenting North Carolina history, Powell is quoted as saying, \\"I simply love discovering things otherwise not well known. North Carolina is unique because we have our own quirky culture and history, and I love to share that with people.\\" Powell‚Äôs hobby of collecting pin-back buttons resulted in a significant collection of items, which he donated to the North Carolina Collection in the Wilson Special Collections Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2007 he donated 2,698 pin-back buttons, badges, ribbons, cloth swatches, promotional cards, and stickers related to politics in North Carolina. Additional donated items include regional travel souvenirs, protest movements, musical ephemera such as concert posters and tickets, advertisements for North Carolina products, and materials related to college and professional athletic teams.

The width of the Gaussian is a sigma value, a hyper-parameter which can be manually defined and manipulated to suit the application. Gradient descent is then used to \\"move\\" the points to their local minima. These local minima then define the cluster centers. QC has not been evaluated against traditional modern clustering algorithms, aside from Jaccard scoring. QC has thus far failed to produce separations with enough variance to exploit at big data scale.  Approximate quantum clustering  Approximate quantum clustering (AQC) attempts to tame some of the computational complexity of QC by reducing the allowed number of Gaussians in a given region. If a pixel is a physical point in a rendering which represents the smallest addressable element (pix, for pictures, el for element), then a voxel is a three-dimensional version of the pixel (vox for volume, el for element). These voxels, while uniform in the space they represent, do not have to be homogenous in their contents. Once the volume of the voxel has been established, AQC limits the allowed number of Gaussians to a maximum of one per voxel. When compared to the quadratic limitations of QC, AQC has the benefit of limiting the computational complexity to O(n * p), where n represents the number of Gaussians, and p represents the number of data points.  Limiting behavior  Traditional approaches to QC tend toward quadratic O(n^2), while solutions in deep learning are necessarily linearly limited due to scale and complexity: O(n). With the possible exception of exponent distance-based quantum clustering algorithms, many QC solutions still required data preprocessing (primarily, cleaning to resolve noise, artifacting, column gapping and interchange). This preprocessing step, even when successful, would introduce inherent data bias by corrupting the full richness of the data set.  Dynamic quantum clustering  Developed by David Horn and Marvin Weinstein in 2009, Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) approaches the complexity problem from a different heading than AQC. Using a mathematical shortcut to simplify the gradient descent, it also features the ability of nearby points in adjacent local minima to \\"tunnel\\" and resolve to a single cluster. A tunneling hyper-parameter determines whether or not a data point \\"tunnels\\" based on the width of the Gaussian.  References  # Brooke, J; Bitko, D.; Rosenbaum, T. F; Aeppli, G.

Gibbons was a significant figure in the founding of the Colony of Cape Breton and was an ally of its first lieutenant-governor, Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres. He was later removed from office by DesBarres' successor William Macarmick, only to be restored after three years and selling of all of his property to advocate on his own behalf. Gibbons never returned to Cape Breton following his restoration, as he and his family were captured and put in a French prison during their return. Gibbons died in the French prison, while his family survived and returned to Cape Breton after their release. Early life Gibbons was born around 1734 in London, England, as the son of Richard and Susannah Gibbons. The family first moved to Virginia, later moving to Halifax with his father in May 1750. He was admitted to the Nova Scotia bar in 1765. Political career Richard Gibbons occupied positions in the colonial legislature, and as an appointed member of the executive council in the colony. He was first elected in 1770 to the colonial legislature as a member for the Barrington Township, a position he occupied for one year. In 1777, Gibbons was appointed the Solicitor General of Cape Breton and in 1781 became the colony's attorney general. In 1784, Gibbons was appointed as the Chief Justice for Cape Breton by Lieutenant-Governor Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres. This occurred after he became involved in a dispute with John Parr, the governor of Nova Scotia, over land grants to United Empire Loyalists. Gibbons was required to sign every land grant, and he argued that he was owed a fee for every individual name listed on the grant. This caused complaints by loyalists, and Parr eventually removed the requirement for Gibbons' signature. Gibbons was a political ally of DesBarres. In 1786, he presented a petition to the government in London seeking DesBarres' restoration as governor after he had been removed from his position following a dispute with John Yorke, the garrison commander for Cape Breton, the previous year. During that dispute, Gibbons sided with DesBarres and attempted to use legal means to require Yorke to let the governor provide the colonists with military equipment. When he became lieutenant-governor in 1787, William Macarmick decided to keep Gibbons in his postings in an attempt to bring reconciliation. However, Gibbons was not happy with the new influence that David Matthews, the attorney general, and Abraham Cuyler, the registrar, held under Macarmick. Gibbons sought to raise a quasi-military group under his own command, named the Friendly Society, to counter the influence of the other three. Macarmick suggested instead that an official militia be organized, a move which Gibbons rejected. Following this Macarmick banned the group as a \\"Seed of Rebellion\\". Later life and death In 1788, following the failure of the Friendly Society, Gibbons attempted to have the grand jury be made the legislative assembly for the Colony of Cape Breton. Macmarick rejected this, and removed Gibbons from his various posts in March. Gibbons' dismissal was controversial amongst his supporters, and he attempted to explain his decisions to authorities in Quebec, Halifax, and London. These efforts were costly, and he sold his farm and other property to pay for them. He was restored to his posts in 1791, but did not attempt to return to Cape Breton until 1794. During his return trip, he and his family were captured and arrested in France. He died during his imprisonment on 4 August 1794 in Nantes, France.

Established in 1906, it was a national union of all workers in the printing trade intended to consolidate them into a single confederation. History The first labor union in the Philippines, called Uni√≥n de Lit√≥grafos e Impresores de Filipinas (Spanish, \\"Lithographers and Printers Union of the Philippines\\") was established in either December 1901 or in 1902 by Isabelo de los Reyes. Not long after its founding, the members reorganized themselves into Uni√≥n Obrera Democr√°tica. Hermenegildo Cruz is credited with conceiving the idea for a national trade union as a solution to the problems labor leaders were encountering in the consolidation of its members. In 1906, such a union for the printing trade, called Uni√≥n de Impresores de Filipinas, was established during a meeting held in Sta. Cruz, Manila. Felipe Mendoza, a lithographer and Cruz's right-hand man, was elected President. Crisanto Evangelista, a typesetter, was Secretary-General; this was the first occasion Evagelista was associated with the labor movement as a leader.

It had its maiden flight on 28 November 2017, around 3 a.m. local time. It is the first ballistic missile developed by North Korea that is theoretically capable of reaching all of the United States mainland. November 2017 test Immediately after the launch, many analysts assumed that a Hwasong-14 had been fired; subsequently, however, the North Korean government released video of the launch showing a completely different missile. North Korea claimed the missile reached an altitude of around 4,475 km and traveled 950 km downrange, flying for a total time of 53 minutes. Based on its trajectory and distance, the missile would have a range of more than 13,000 km (8,100 miles) ‚Äì more than enough to reach Washington D.C. and the rest of the United States, albeit, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, probably with a reduced payload. Several important US allies, including the United Kingdom and France, also lie within the missile's theoretical range, which covers most of Earth's land masses except South America, the Caribbean, and the majority of Antarctica. Some international weapons experts, however, believe the missile is only capable of firing a light warhead. The different densities of different casing materials and explosive mechanisms (e.g. metallic-based conventional explosives tend to be several times heavier than a corresponding volume of organic explosives) make accurately estimating warhead payload based on images alone very difficult, if not impossible. Based on the limited information available, the Union of Concerned Scientists did conclude that equipping the missile with a normal-sized payload would likely reduce the overall range. It was the first launch after a 10-week break. According to a statement by Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera, the missile's re- entry vehicle failed to successfully re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, breaking apart and crashing into waters within Japan's exclusive economic zone. Later assessments from the Union of Concerned Scientists, however, raised questions as to whether the object Onodera described may have been the missile's detached first stage, not its re-entry vehicle. Design =Engine= According to international weapons analysts, the Hwasong-15 first stage has a gimbaled two-chambered main engine system, as opposed to the Hwasong-12 and Hwasong-14 which have one fixed main chamber and four gimbaled steering vernier thruster chambers. According to missile specialist Norbert Br√ºgge, the missile uses the ‚ÄòPaektusan, Î∞±ÎëêÏÇ∞‚Äô, the first stage of the two stage missile uses an RD-250 clone liquid propulsion system developed by Pyongyang, comprising two combustors fed by common turbopump to increase takeoff thrust. The new propulsion is estimated to have 170 percent increase in thrust, compared to the Hwasong-14. =Warhead= On November 29, 2017, Michael Elleman wrote for 38 North that at 13,000 km, the payload would be around , based on flight data of the test and conjectured it was a reconfigured Hwasong-14 and on November 30, after release of the images and video of launch, he wrote a subsequent article on 38th North in which he stated that he first visualized the design of the missile based solely on flight data. After seeing the images and video, Elleman increased the maximum estimate of payload from 150 kg to at a range of 13,000 km. He noted major differences in the design of the actual Hwasong-15 and the missile he visualized the day before, from the dimensions to two nozzles/engine instead of one, such as on the Hwasong-14. Analysts have noted that the re-entry vehicle has a blunter nose than previous designs, which can accommodate a larger diameter warhead and reduces re-entry stress and heating at the cost of accuracy. Some analysts think it may have been designed with multiple warheads or decoys in mind. =Launch vehicle= Hwasong-15 Transporter erector vehicle The 9 axle Transporter erector launcher (TEL) vehicle is larger compared to the 8 axle TEL vehicle of the Hwasong-14. However, just like the Hwasong-14, the launch footage indicates the missile was fired from a fixed launch pad, not from the vehicle.

NZOQ was incorporated on 31 January 1978. The organisation is based in Palmerston North, with an additional support office in Auckland.  Mission  The mission of the organisation is to \\"promote and support the maximisation of capability in world-class business processes and performance for businesses and individuals [within New Zealand]\\" through advocacy, education, promotion, and support.  History  = Formation = In 1976, a conference was organised in Palmerston North by the Department of Industrial Management and Engineering of Massey University and a meeting was convened to discuss the idea of a national organisation for quality assurance in New Zealand. As a consequence, a steering committee was set up with the aim of investigating the need for a professional body and what form it might take. In May 1977, the committee reported back that there was a need for a professional body for quality assurance in line with the American Society for Quality Control. Delegates at the Massey University conference at which NZOQA was formed, May 1977 The constitution of the New Zealand Organisation for Quality Assurance was registered in January 1978. It included the mission of the organisation and stated in part that there would be an annual conference and a quarterly journal. A requirement was to provide training to members and to allow a 'local' flavour to be incorporated into the organisational structure via regional committees. The national committee was to consist of representatives of the various regional committees with a rotating President every two years. The first two years were spent setting up the national organisation, internal structures, and running small-scale workshops. Meanwhile, the membership grew from 21 individuals and 23 company members in July 1977 to over 500 members representing over 140 companies by May 1978. = Development = During the late 1970s, while quality education was being carried out by NZOQA on a regional basis, the Certificate of Quality Assurance was developed to cover different aspects of quality assurance as a more structured approach to quality education. In 1978, an initiative with the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology (NZIFST) led to the development of the Diploma in Food Quality Assurance at Massey University, and later the Diploma in Quality Assurance. NZOQA promoted quality assurance and the principles and practices of total quality management (TQM) to New Zealand businesses throughout the 1980s. New Zealand organisations at the time opted for ISO 9000 in preference to TQM, as ISO offered them international recognition and TQM was perceived to be too different from conventional management.McKean, J.

Proceedings of the 7th annual NZ engineering and technology conference (pp. 109‚Äì117). Palmerston North, New Zealand: Massey University. NZOQA began to move away from its close association with Massey University when it held its first stand-alone conference in 1980. The organisation changed its name to the New Zealand Organisation for Quality in 1992, at which time it had more than 1000 members. The Square, in the centre of Palmerston North = Expansion = In 2016, NZOQ and the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation (which was established in 1992 as the New Zealand Quality Foundation) merged operations to allow for a broader range of expertise and capabilities in providing leadership in the practices of quality management and performance excellence in New Zealand.Innes, J. (2005). A conceptual framework for starting the business excellence (BE) journey in New Zealand service organisations (pp. 7‚Äì10). Palmerston North, New Zealand: Massey University.  Programmes and services  NZOQ has divisions that cater for members in particular areas of New Zealand, including four permanent branches based in Auckland (Northern Branch), Palmerston North (Central Branch), Christchurch (Canterbury Branch), and Dunedin (Otago‚ÄìSouthland Branch). Training and educational programmes that have been established by NZOQ are often run in conjunction with other local educational institutions, such as the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand. NZOQ also endorses tertiary qualifications such as the Master of Quality Systems offered by Massey University.

For example, the symmetric powers V mapsto operatorname{Sym}^n(V) and the exterior powers V mapsto wedge^n(V) are polynomial functors from mathcal{V} to mathcal{V}; these two are also Schur functors. The notion appears in representation theory as well as category theory (the calculus of functors). In particular, the category of homogeneous polynomial functors of degree n is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional representations of the symmetric group S_n over a field of characteristic zero.  Definition  Let k be a field of characteristic zero and mathcal{V} the category of finite-dimensional k-vector spaces and k-linear maps. Then an endofunctor Fcolon mathcal{V} to mathcal{V} is a polynomial functor if the following equivalent conditions hold: *For every pair of vector spaces X, Y in mathcal{V}, the map Fcolon operatorname{Hom}(X, Y) to operatorname{Hom}(F(X), F(Y)) is a polynomial mapping (i.e., a vector-valued polynomial in linear forms). *Given linear maps f_i: X to Y, , 1 le i le r in mathcal{V}, the function (lambda_1, dots, lambda_r) mapsto F(lambda_1 f_1 + cdots + lambda_r f_r) defined on k^r is a polynomial function with coefficients in operatorname{Hom}(F(X), F(Y)). A polynomial functor is said to be homogeneous of degree n if for any linear maps f_1, dots, f_r in mathcal{V} with common domain and codomain, the vector-valued polynomial F(lambda_1 f_1 + cdots + lambda_r f_r) is homogeneous of degree n.  Variants  If ‚Äúfinite vector spaces‚Äù is replaced by ‚Äúfinite sets‚Äù, one gets the notion of combinatorial species (to be precise, those of polynomial nature).  References  *Macdonald, Ian G.

Developer Hongkong Land acquired the land when it acquired Dairy Farm in 1972, and originally planned to build a hotel on the site. The cold stores had been demolished and the site was temporarily used as a public car park. The new Windsor House was designed by Hong Kong architecture firm Palmer and Turner. It bore the same name as another Hongkong Land building, on Des Voeux Road Central, that was being demolished as part of the company's major redevelopment of their older properties in Central. The building is angled diagonally (relative to the street grid) in order to maximise views of Victoria Park from the office floors. In the 1990s, the building was said to comprise about of office space and of retail accommodation. A contract to construct the first phase of the building was signed on 14 April 1978 by Hongkong Land and Gammon Construction, and work began on the following day, 15 April 1978. A topping out ceremony was held on 3 July 1979. The initial anchor tenant was the Inland Revenue Department, which leased about a third of the office space at Windsor House to centralise departments that had been scattered across a number of different office buildings. The building has two service cores ‚Äì housing lifts, stairwells, toilets, and other uses ‚Äì which flank the office floors. Part of the reason for including a second service core was that the Inland Revenue Department wanted its own entrance and lifts. The Inland Revenue Department later moved to the government-owned Revenue Tower in order to save on rental costs. In September 1987 Chinese Estates acquired two properties from Hongkong Land, Windsor House and Harcourt House, for HK$2.38 billion. Windsor House was said to constitute $1.6 billion of this sum. The retail podium was renovated in 1992. At this time the first to ninth floors of the office tower, which had been vacated by the Inland Revenue Department, were converted to dining and entertainment use. When the building first opened, the retail podium housed a Lane Crawford department store. In mid-1997, when their lease at Windsor House expired, Lane Crawford moved to nearby Times Square, owned by parent company Wharf, due to high rents as well as projected higher sales at the new location. The retail podium was extensively renovated from 2007 to 2010. In December 2015 it was announced that China Estates would sell Windsor House to its largest shareholder, the tycoon and fugitive Joseph Lau, for $12 billion. Transport The building is a short walk from Exit E of Causeway Bay Station.

Tsapatsis is the 36th Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Prior to this position he was the Amundson Chair (2008‚Äìpresent), Professor (2003-present), and McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair (2017‚ÄìPresent) in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. Prior to his appointment at the University of Minnesota, Tsapatsis was an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is well-recognized for his wide- ranging research in zeolite synthesis, especially his contributions to the design of hierarchical zeolite structures and their applications in catalysis and membrane separations. According to Web of Science, he has produced over 250 published works that have been cited over 12,500 times, with an h-index of 62 as of February 23, 2018. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2015. Early life & education  Michael Tsapatsis was born in 1965 in Athens, Greece. He received his diploma in chemical engineering at the University of Patras, Greece, in 1988. Working under the supervision of G.R. Gavalas at the California Institute of Technology, Tsapatsis received his M.S. in chemical engineering in 1991 and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1994. His dissertation was titled \\"Composite inorganic membranes for gas separations: Chemical vapor deposition of hydrogen permselective oxide membranes and preparation of supported zeolite NaA films.\\" Tsapatsis completed post-doctoral training with Mark E. Davis at the California Institute of Technology. He subsequently joined the faculty at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1994. Tsapatsis and his wife, Efronisi, have two children.  Contributions to Chemical Engineering  Tsapatsis is internationally recognized for his outstanding contributions and achievements as a chemical engineer. His early work as an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts up to recent research at the University of Minnesota addressed the preparation of zeolite films as membranes for molecular separation. Over a decade of work addressing the challenge of disintegration of fabricated sheets eventually led to multiple discoveries allowing for the preparation of \\"layered nanosheets\\" that are just a few silicon atoms thick. Fundamental research alongside engineering and process development has led to advances in separation with membranes for applications including xylene separation, biofuels purification, and sour gas cleaning. Tsapatsis has also developed hierarchical zeolite particles with unique properties of value to chemical properties that utilize adsorption and catalysis. In 2011, he discovered a synthesis method for preparing nanosheets of microporous materials that could be organized as sheets for filtration application. In 2012, Tsapatsis led a team of researchers to develop a hierarchical zeolite nanoparticle called Self-Pillared Pentasil (SPP). Consisting of nanoscale pores, SPP was characterized and shown to have tunable properties similar to conventional zeolites used in gas separation and fuel refining, but integrated large pores (mesopores) provided enhanced diffusion capability for molecular transport. The breadth of accomplishments extends beyond zeolite synthesis by developing applications in structured catalysts, oriented molecular sieve films, and molecular sieve/polymer nanocomposites for membrane applications, and adsorbents for commercial cleaning processes. He has been part of catalysis research teams that have developed new processes to prepare renewable chemicals including isoprene, p-xylene, and bio-derived surfactants. His zeolites have also been selected for enhancing existing applications including energy-demanding processes such as ethanol dehydration.  Awards, Honors, and Professional Service  For his outstanding research and education efforts, Tsapatsis has received numerous awards including: *2017 McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair *2013 Breck Award from the International Zeolite Association *2013 Alpha Chi Sigma Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineering *2008 George W. Taylor for Distinguished Research *2007 Charles M.A. Stine Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineering *1998 Outstanding Junior Faculty Award from the University of Massachusetts Amherst *1998 Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award *1996 David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering *1996 NSF CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation In addition to being elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2015, he is also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 2013 was elected as a council member of the International Zeolite Association. Tsapatsis is well known for his expertise in zeolite synthesis with invitations to present over 150 lectures including the Dow Lecture (Rice University), the ExxonMobil Lecture (UMass Amherst), the S.V. Sotirchos Lecture, and the G.C.A. Schuit Lectures (University of Delaware). He has also served the broader scientific community as an editor for the journal Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, the official journal of the International Zeolite Association. He has also a member of the editorial board for the journal Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and an advisory board member of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research.

The Bi-Bi bond lengths are 3.07 √Ö. Bismuth polycations are polyatomic ions of the formula Bixn+. They were originally observed in solutions of bismuth metal in molten bismuth chloride. It has since been found that these clusters are present in the solid state, particularly in salts where germanium tetrachloride or tetrachloroaluminate serve as the counteranions, but also in amorphous phases such as glasses and gels. Bismuth endows materials with a variety of interesting optical properties that can be tuned by changing the supporting material. Commonly-reported structures include the trigonal bipyramidal cluster, the octahedral cluster, the square antiprismatic cluster, and the tricapped trigonal prismatic cluster.

The shapes of these clusters are generally dictated by Wade's rules, which are based on the treatment of the electronic structure as delocalized molecular orbitals. The bonding can also be described with three- center two-electron bonds in some cases, such as the cluster. Bismuth clusters have been observed to act as ligands for copper and ruthenium ions. This behavior is possible due to the otherwise fairly inert lone pairs on each of the bismuth that arise primarily from the s-orbitals left out of Bi‚ÄìBi bonding. The 0.60 isosurface of the ELF of a cluster. Localizations around the nuclei are pink and lone pairs are purple.  Optical properties  The variety of electron-deficient sigma aromatic clusters formed by bismuth gives rise to a wide range of spectroscopic behaviors. Of particular interest are the systems capable of low-energy electronic transitions, as these have demonstrated potential as near-infrared light emitters. It is the tendency of electron-deficient bismuth to form sigma-delocalized clusters with small HOMO/LUMO gaps that gives rise to the near-infrared emissions. This property makes these species potentially valuable to the field of near-infrared optical tomography, which exploits the near-infrared window in biological tissue.

He died on February 22, 2020, while filming a stunt for an upcoming Science Channel television series.  Background  Hughes spent his childhood in Oklahoma City. He soon acquired an interest in motorcycle racing. In 2002, Hughes set a Guinness world record with a jump in a Lincoln Town Car stretch limousine. He stated during an interview with the Associated Press in 2018 that he had planned to run for Governor of California. At the time of his death, Hughes lived in Apple Valley, California.  Rocket launches  =2014 launch= According to the Associated Press, Hughes built his first manned rocket on January 30, 2014, and flew in just over one minute over Winkelman, Arizona. According to CBC News, Hughes collapsed after the landing and it took him three days to recover. Hughes stated that the injuries suffered from the flight put him in a walker for two weeks. There was no video of Hughes entering the rocket and there were doubts that he was in it when it launched. = Flat-Earth rocket fundraising and launch = In 2016, Hughes launched a failed fundraising attempt for a rocket that raised $310. After professing his belief in a flat Earth later that year, Hughes gained support within the flat- Earth community. His post-flat-Earth fundraising campaign made its $7,875 goal. He had said he intended to make multiple rocket journeys, culminating in a flight to outer space, where he believed he would be able to take a picture of the entire Earth as a flat disc. He said in November 2017 that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had given him verbal permission more than a year prior to launch his rocket, pending approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. However, a BLM spokesman said its local field office had no record of speaking to Hughes at the time. According to the BLM, after seeing some news articles about the planned launch, a BLM representative reached out to Hughes with concerns. The rocket launch was originally scheduled for the weekend of November 25, 2017; Hughes then rescheduled for December 2, 2017, blaming ongoing difficulties in obtaining permissions. Hughes moved his launch pad so that he could take off and land on private property, but the BLM maintained he still needed to fill out permits. Hughes defiantly stated that the dispute would not stop him from flying: \\"I'm a daredevil. I'm not much for authority or rules.\\" The untested initial rocket was intended to reach a speed of ; further rocket trips, which were to be launched from a balloon up, were intended to reach above the atmosphere into outer space. Hughes acknowledged there were risks, telling the Associated Press: \\"It's scary as hell. But none of us are getting out of this world alive.\\" A fundraising campaign to cover the costs of the delay raised around $100 of its $10,000 goal. On February 3, 2018, Hughes live-streamed another attempted launch, but the rocket steam release malfunctioned and the launch was aborted. A successful launch on March 24, 2018, resulted in his reaching a height of and a hard landing in the Mojave Desert. The steam-powered rocket launched at a sharp angle to avoid falling back to Earth on public land, and landed about away from the launch point. Hughes' team reported a maximum speed of . Hughes reported no serious injury from the landing. = Planned 2019 launch = Hughes planned to again launch himself in a rocket on August 10, 2019, but mechanical troubles postponed the launch. The following weekend, the launch was again postponed and Hughes was treated for heat exhaustion. = 2020 launch and death = On February 22, 2020, Hughes died near Barstow, California, following the crash of a rocket he was piloting, built by Hughes and his collaborator Waldo Stakes. During launch, the rocket‚Äôs parachute, which was designed for landing, appeared to deploy early and detach from the craft. A witness at the launch, freelance journalist Justin Chapman, said that the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, perhaps tearing the parachutes. The launch event was being filmed for the Science Channel television series Homemade Astronauts, in which Hughes was to star. Following Hughes' death, Darren Shuster, his public relations representative, stated: \\"We used flat Earth as a PR stunt... Flat Earth allowed us to get so much publicity that we kept going! I know he didn‚Äôt believe in flat Earth and it was a schtick.\\"  In popular culture  Hughes appeared in the music video for the Death Valley Girls' song \\"One Less Thing (Before I Die)\\". The 1:53 min long video was directed by Kansas Bowling and featured footage of his \\"Flat Earth\\" rocket launch in Apple Valley.

The sensor begins transmitting medical data after it is consumed. The technology that makes up the pill, as well as the data transmitted by the pill's sensor, are considered to be part of digital medicine. The purpose of the sensor is to determine whether the person is taking their medication or not (called \\"adherence\\"). There are privacy concerns with respect to who receives the data and what is done with it. Overview left The first emergence of a swallowable electronic device was in 1957, this device used radio frequency to transmit temperature and pressure readings.Jacobson, B.; Mackay, R. S. A pH-Endoradiosonde Lancet 1957, 269, 1224‚Äì 1224 DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(57)91792-0 The field lay stagnant until technology caught up with invention in the 1990s. The first digital pill to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a version of aripiprazole (Abilify) manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, was approved in November 2017. This digital pill's sensor, developed by Proteus Digital Health, is activated by acid in the stomach, and generates an electrical signal that is picked up by a patch worn on the ribcage; the patch in turn forwards information to a smartphone app. The drug is taken by people with schizophrenia. People with the condition tend to have problems with adherence, and the digital pill could help with that; however some people with schizophernia have paranoia which the digital pill could make worse. A video from the Wall Street Journal that shows an overview of how digital pills work can be found here: https://www.wsj.com/video/what-is-a-digital- pill/6A4444D6-DBAD-421A-8B53-C51E23A20268.html Types of Digital Pills The most common types of ingestible sensors are used for imaging, sensing different types of gasses, to monitor medication compliance or absorption of medication, and electrochemical signal sensing. =Imaging Capsules= Images and video require the highest bandwidth for data delivery. Ingestible capsules containing video cameras are used for generating images of the macroscopic structures of hollow organs, such as the stomach and small bowel. These devices are powered by batteries, can transmit video at up to 2.7 Mbit/s, and are less invasive than other traditional endoscopic imaging devices. =Gas Sensing Capsules= Gas Sensing Capsules utilize a gas-permeable membrane surrounding an electrochemical gas sensor and are primarily used to detect the partial-pressures of different gasses produced as the byproduct of metabolic reactions by bacteria in the intestines. The presence of gasses like carbon dioxide and methane in the gut provides useful data for analysis of metabolic and digestional health. This internal measurement of a body's organs provides a superior analysis in terms of accuracy and reliability as compared to the traditional technique of breath-test analysis. =Medication Monitoring Capsules= Ingestible sensors that are specific for the monitoring of the absorption of medication or compliance will also signal the user that medication needs to be taken. These are activated in the stomach by pH differences and will transmit via Bluetooth. =Electrochemical Sensing Capsules= Voltammetry can be used in vitro on stool liquid as a Gi tract diagnostic tool. The device would be able to perform cyclic, square wave, and differential pulse voltammetries.McCaffrey, C.; Twomey, K.; Ogurtsov, V. I. Development of a Wireless Swallowable Capsule with Potentiostatic Electrochemical Sensor for Gastrointestinal Track Investigation Sens. Actuators, B 2015, 218, 8‚Äì 15 DOI: 10.1016/j.snb.2015.04.063 Sensing Targets Due to the nature of ingestible sensors, they are optimized for passage through hollow organs. This makes them ideal for data collection throughout the digestive tract, which includes multiple organs between the mouth and anus. =Oral Cavity= The most common clinical targets for the ingestible sensor in the oral cavity would aid in the determination of: electrolyte imbalances, body metabolism based on chemical makeup of saliva, hormonal imbalances, infectious conditions, i.e. HIV and viral hepatitis, allergy disorders and cancer. =Esophagas= Digital pills that have imaging capabilities are used in endoscopy to look for inflammation and lacerations in the esophagus. The mucosa contained in the esophagus can also be tested to look for issues such as eosinophilic esophagitis. =Stomach= The pH value of the stomach is important for proper digestion and is something that can be detected by certain types of digital pills. Stomach enzymes and electrolyte production are also able to be detected by a digital pill. These pills can also search for specific bacteria in various areas of the body. For example, digital pills can be programmed to search for helicobacter pylori in the stomach, which is known to be a cause of ulcers. =Colon= The potential targets would be to monitor stool (colonic content) for medical diagnosis of infection (parasite, viral, or bacterial sources), poor nutrient absorption, or colon cancer. Also, the ingestible sensor could do an internal colonoscopy that would be less invasive than traditional. Powering the Digital Pill Most digital pills use silver-oxide batteries. Lithium ion batteries are dangerous to the human bodies digestive system and therefore cannot be used. Passive and Active Digital Pill Locomotion Most digital pills rely on passive locomotion, or allowing the body's digestive system to do all the work moving the pill, however some pills do utilise active locomotion. One active locomotion method is to include a small magnet in the digital pill that can then be activated by an external magnetic field, which can then move the pill from outside the body. Device Safety Digital pills are not safe for use in patients with pacemakers as the pill and the pacemaker may interfere with each other.

Educated in the United States, she taught at Yenching University, China University of Political Science and Law, and Peking University in Beijing, and Soochow University, St. John's University, University of Shanghai, and Aurora University in Shanghai. She was a cofounder of Zhongzheng University in Jiangxi during the Second Sino-Japanese War. She co-founded the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), one of the eight legally recognized non-Communist parties in China. After performing manual labour during the Cultural Revolution, she served as Vice-Mayor of Beijing (1977‚Äì1983), Vice-President of the All-China Women's Federation, Vice-Chair of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1986‚Äì1988), Vice-Chair of the National People's Congress (1988‚Äì1998), and Chair of the CAPD (1987‚Äì1997). Early life and education Lei Jieqiong was born 12 September 1905 in Guangzhou during the late Qing dynasty, with her ancestral home in Taishan, Guangdong. Her grandfather went to the United States during the California Gold Rush and became a prosperous businessman, but left his third son Lei Zichang (1875‚Äì1926) in Guangdong to receive a traditional Chinese education. Lei Zichang won a juren degree before the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty in 1911. He then studied law in Beijing and became a lawyer and magazine editor in Guangdong. Lei Jieqiong was born to Lei Zichang and his wife Li Peizhi. Lei's father provided her with a progressive education and sent her to study in California when she was 19. After learning English, she studied chemical engineering at the University of California and Far East studies at Stanford University, before graduating from the University of Southern California in 1931 with a master's degree in sociology. While a student she supported herself by teaching Chinese to Chinese-American children. Wartime career In 1931 Lei returned to China and became a lecturer at the Sociology Department of Yenching University (later merged with Peking University). As Japan invaded Manchuria and encroached upon North China, Lei and her students joined the December 9th Movement to demand that the Nationalist Government resist Japanese aggression. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, the Japanese occupied Beijing and launched a full- scale war to invade China. Lei went to Nanchang, Jiangxi Province to join the National Salvation Movement. She served in a women's advancement group which cared for wounded soldiers and was awarded the rank of colonel. She also taught at a women's training class at the Jiangxi Political Movement Institute, one of whose two deans was Chiang Ching-kuo, the future President of the Republic of China. When Nanchang fell to the Japanese in 1939, she moved to Ji'an in southern Jiangxi, where she became a friend of the Communist leader Zhou Enlai. In 1933, Lei published an article advocating family planning. During the Sino-Japanese War, she wrote many essays based on her studies of women's lives, careers, and struggles in wartime. They were later published in the two-volume Selected Works of Lei Jieqiong. Lei Jieqiong giving a speech at an anti-war rally in Shanghai, 1946 In 1940 Lei helped to found Zhongzheng University (now Nanchang University). A year later she went to Shanghai, where she became a professor at Soochow University and also taught at St. John's University, University of Shanghai, and Aurora University. In 1945 she cofounded the political party China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), and would served as its chairwoman decades later. After the end of the World War II, in June 1946 the Shanghai Union of People's Associations sent 11 representatives, including Lei, to capital Nanjing to petition the Kuomintang government not to resume the civil war against the Communists. When they arrived at Xiaguan train station in Nanjing, they were assaulted by thugs and injured. The Xiaguan incident raised an outcry in Chinese media, which blamed the KMT government for the attack. Zhou Enlai visited them in the hospital. At the end of the year, Lei returned to Yenching University and became a professor of sociology. People's Republic of China Lei Jieqiong at the first CPPCC conference, September 1949 After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Lei held high-ranking positions in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress (NPC) for over 40 years. She also served as vice-dean of Beijing College of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law). During the Cultural Revolution, she and her husband were sent to perform manual labour in rural Anhui province, but Zhou Enlai managed to relieve them from \\"reform through labour\\". After the Cultural Revolution, Lei served as a law professor at Peking University and was appointed Vice-Mayor of Beijing (1977‚Äì1983). She also served as Vice- President of the All-China Women's Federation, Vice-Chair of the CPPCC (1986‚Äì1988), Vice-Chair of the NPC (1988‚Äì1998), and Chair of the CAPD (1987‚Äì1997). Lei taught at Peking University until the age of 100. She died on 9 January 2011 at the age of 105.

His father was a successful builder of skylights. He moved with his parents to Terre Haute, Indiana in 1848. There he helped support his family by working part-time as a barber while attending a subscription school organized by the local African-American community for four years, followed by a Quaker high school in Hartford in Vigo County for two years.John R.

The Institute, part of the Greenville Settlement which straddled the Indiana-Ohio state line, was also attended by Hiram Revels, who would become the first African-American United States Senator. In 1859, Hinton was elected Grand Master of the Indiana lodge of the Prince Hall Masons. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Hinton sought to enlist in the Union Army in Indiana but was turned away because of his race. When African Americans were allowed to enlist in 1863, Hinton accepted a lieutanant's commission and became a recruiting officer for various Union regiments, including the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and 28th Indiana Infantry Regiment (Colored).Gregg op-ed In 1862, Hinton moved to Indianapolis, which remained his home for the duration of his life, and where he set up a real estate business. There he married Eliza J. Mitchell. Political career After the Civil War, Hinton became known as a powerful Republican campaigner, speaking in numerous states. His rise in political status was propelled by his strong ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Masons. In 1872, Hinton was elected as an at-large delegate to the Republican National Convention. He was one of only two African-American delegates there. From 1874 to 1878, Hinton served as a trustee of the Wabash and Erie Canal, becoming Indiana's first African- American holder of statewide office. In 1880, Hinton was elected to represent Marion County in the Indiana State House. He served only one term, being defeated in the next primary by Dr. Samuel A. Elbert, also African-American but who failed to win the general election.encyclo at p. 240 Nonetheless, Hinton remained politically active thereafter. Death and legacy In 1892, after giving a speech in support of the Republican campaign in Brazil, Indiana, Hinton collapsed and died. He is buried in Indianapolis' historic Crown Hill Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7183765/james-sidney- hinton In 2014, a bust of Hinton was unveiled at the Indiana State Capitol, where it stands on the second floor alongside the bust of U.S. Representative Julia Carson as part of a permanent Black history display.

Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War has been substantial since the beginning of armed insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War, and turned into active support and troop deployment from 2012 onwards. By 2014, Hezbollah involvement begun to turn steady in support of Syrian Ba'athist Government forces across Syria. Hezbollah deployed several thousand fighters in Syria and by 2015 lost up to 1500 fighters in combat. Since 2011, Lebanon has absorbed Syrian refugees and provided humanitarian aid too. According to the UNHCR, there were over 1 million Syrian refugees who had been registered in Lebanon in 2016.  Background  Lebanon had traditionally been seen by Syria as part of Greater Syria: under the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and Syria were included within one administrative entity. Following World War I, the League of Nations Mandate partitioned Ottoman Greater Syria under French control, eventually leading to the creation of nation-states Lebanon and Syria. Relations between the two countries had been strained, especially with the 29-year Syrian Occupation of Lebanon, accusations of Syrian intervention within Lebanese politics before and after withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, and suspicions of Syria assassinating Lebanese political figures like former prime minister Rafic Hariri. Syria officially recognized Lebanon's sovereignty in 2008. Lebanon-Syria relations were officially established in October 2008 when Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree to establish diplomatic relations with Lebanon for the first time since both countries gained independence from France in 1943.  Official Lebanese standpoint  During the war, conflicting statements were issued by Lebanese politicians in regard to the Syrian Civil War, though in general the Lebanese Republic remained neutral in the conflict. The Hezbollah and Amal affiliated politicians and ministers generally stated in support to the Syrian Ba'athist government, whereas other parties criticized it. Since 2012, Hezbollah actively intervened in the Syrian War, supporting the Ba'athist forces.  Absorption of Syrian refugees and humanitarian aid  Since 2011, Lebanon has absorbed Syrian refugees and provided humanitarian aid too. According to the UNHCR, there were over 1 million Syrian refugees who had been registered in Lebanon in 2016. Nevertheless, this figure is likely largely underestimated since the UNHCR has stopped registering new Syrian refugees since May 2015 and it doesn't include individuals awaiting to be registered. Hence, precise figures of the number of Syrian people in Lebanon don't exist currently. Recent estimates were as high as 1,500,000 people.  Border incidents and spillover  Between 2011 and 2017, fighting from the Syrian Civil War spilled over into Lebanon as opponents and supporters of the Syrian rebels travelled to Lebanon to fight and attack each other on Lebanese soil. The Syrian conflict has been described as having stoked a \\"resurgence of sectarian violence in Lebanon\\", with many of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims supporting the rebels in Syria, while many Shi'ites have supported Assad, whose Alawite minority is usually described as an offshoot of Shi'a Islam. Killings, unrest, and kidnappings of foreign citizens across Lebanon resulted. Pro-Syrian forces fought against opposition to the al-Assad presidency in the Bab al-Tabbaneh, Jabal Mohsen clashes, leading to the deaths of three people and more injuries. Tripoli has a majority Sunni Muslim population but also secular pro-Assad Alawites. One Sunni cleric alleged that the Syrian president sent forces into Tripoli to introduce unrest within the region. March 2012 discussions on the national level include concerns that toppling the al-Assad government would result in regional instability for Lebanon and Iraq.  Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian War  Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War has been substantial since the beginning of armed insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War, and turned into active support and troop deployment from 2012 onwards. By 2014, Hezbollah involvement begun to turn steady in support of Syrian Ba'athist Government forces across Syria. Hezbollah deployed several thousand fighters in Syria and by 2015 lost up to 1500 fighters in combat. Hezbollah has also been very active to prevent rebel penetration from Syria to Lebanon, being one of the most active forces in the Syrian Civil War spillover in Lebanon. In the past, Hezbollah has served a strategic arm of Iran in the region, allegedly playing a key role in the Iran-Israel and Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflicts in the middle east. In a number of occasions, Hezbollah weapon convoys in Syria and Syrian-Lebanese border areas were attacked, with Israel being the main suspected party behind most such attacks, though Israel did not claim responsibility except for the March 2017 Israel‚ÄìSyria incident. Hezbollah convoys have also been attacked by Syrian rebel factions, most notably the Al-Nusra Front.

Due to these incidents, Priest gained the moniker \\"the unsinkable stoker\\". Life Priest was the son of Harry Priest, a labourer and his wife Elizabeth Garner, and was one of twelve children. In 1915, Priest married Annie Martin, n√©e Hampton in Birkenhead and had three children, called Arthur John, George and Frederick Harry. The family lived for a number of years at 17 Briton Street, Southampton. Priest worked as a stoker, in the bowels of steam- powered ships. He was considered a part of the black gang, in a group of 27 men, which consisted of six firemen, two trimmers, and the firemen's steward colloquially known as a 'peggy' whose task was to bring food and refreshments to the group. The work was intense and often done while stripped to the waist due to the sustained and intense heat of the furnaces. While working as a stoker, Priest survived five ship sinkings and one collision. The ships he voyaged on included the HMHS Asturias (1907), RMS Olympic (1911), RMS Titanic (1912), RMS Alcantara 1916, HMHS Britannic (1916) and SS Donegal (1917). Accidents and sinkings at this time were relatively common. Two other survivors of the Titanic, Archie Jewell and Violet Jessop, would later also survive the sinking of the Britannic with Priest. In 1917 Priest was awarded the Mercantile Marine Ribbon for his service in the war. After surviving the sinking of five ships in total and one major collision, Priest retired from working at sea and left his job as a stoker aboard ships. He lived out the rest of his days on dry land in Southampton, England with his wife Annie. He claimed that \\"no one wished to sail with him after these disasters.\\" Other than his survival stories, there is little information about his personal life. According to sources, he died in 1937 \\"at his Southampton home at the age of 49 from pneumonia with his wife Annie at his side\\". He was buried at Hollybrook Cemetery in Southampton, England. He was given the nickname \\"the unsinkable stoker\\" because of his stories of survival at sea.  References  External links * Titanic‚Äôs Unsinkable Survivors The Old Salt Blog.

Career Rata gained both her MSc and PhD from the University of Auckland. After a Senior Fulbright Scholar to Georgetown University, Washington, DC in 2003, she returned to Auckland and rose to professor in 2017. Both her Master's thesis, 'Maori survival and structural separateness: the history of Te Runanga o nga Kura Kaupapa Maori o Tamaki Makaurau 1987‚Äì1989,' and her doctoral thesis, 'Global capitalism and the revival of ethnic traditionalism in New Zealand : the emergence of tribal-capitalism,' are related to biculturalism in New Zealand. In 2003 Rata published an opinion piece on the New Zealand school secondary curriculum decrying the lack of explicit knowledge and a 'focus on skills and the process of learning.' The piece was directly criticised by authors such as Steve Maharey and Jane Gilbert For the past 10 years she has been Director of the Knowledge in Education Research Unit (KERU) at the University of Auckland and has published widely about knowledge in education. Commenting on Rata's stance on MƒÅori language immersion education, Leonie Pihama (then an academic at the University of Auckland) said: The recent attack by Elizabeth Rata on Kaupapa Maori developments highlights a disturbing trend of racism being disguised as public debate. Rata is a member of, and wrote a position paper for, the 'Independent Constitutional Review' a think tank which has been opposed to placing biculturalism in the New Zealand constitution.Rata, Elizabeth.

It was the first time in history that a torpedo craft sank its target without being sunk itself. Background The Principality of Romania acquired its first torpedo boat in 1875, two years before the start of the Russo-Turkish War. She was built in the United Kingdom. Named R√¢ndunica, she was a 10-ton launch armed with a single spar torpedo. She was powered by a steam engine giving her a top speed of 8 knots and had a crew of five. Romania joined the Russo-Turkish War in April 1877, signing a treaty of alliance with the Russian Empire which allowed the Russian Army to cross through Romanian territory. On 10 May, Romania declared its independence. Engagement According to the Russian- Romanian treaty signed in April that year, R√¢ndunica served under joint Romanian-Russian command. She was also known as Tsarevich by the Russians. Her crew consisted of two Russian Lieutenants, Dubasov and Shestakov, and three Romanians: Major Murgescu (the official liaison officer with the Russian headquarters), an engine mechanic and a navigator. The attack of R√¢ndunica took place during the night of 25‚Äì26 May 1877, near MƒÉcin. As she was approaching the Ottoman monitor Seyfi, the latter fired three rounds at her without any effect. Before she could fire the fourth round, R√¢ndunica's spar struck her between the midships and the stern. A powerful explosion followed, with debris from the Ottoman warship raising up to 40 meters in the air. The half-sunk monitor then re-opened fire, but was struck once again, with the same devastating effects. The crew of Seyfi subsequently fired their rifles at R√¢ndunica, as the latter was retreating and their monitor was sinking. Following this action, Ottoman warships throughout the remainder of the war would always retreat upon sighting spar torpedo boats. The Russian Lieutenants Dubasov and Shestakov were decorated with the Order of St. George, while Major Murgescu was decorated with the Order of Saint Vladimir as well as the Order of the Star of Romania. R√¢ndunica was returned to full Romanian control in 1878, after the Russian ground forces had finished crossing the Danube.Mihai Georgescu, Warship International, 1987: The Romanian Navy's Torpedo Boat RindunicaCristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Romanian navy torpedo boats, Modelism, 2003, pp. 13-19 Aftermath This engagement was the first instance in history when a torpedo craft sank its target without being sunk itself.Lawrence Sondhaus, Navies of Europe, p. 9 The Ottomans lost a 400-ton ironclad warship, with a maximum armor thickness of 76 mm and armed with two 120 mm guns. She had a crew of 51.Navypedia: Hƒ∞ZBER river monitors (1876) Over half a century later, on 14 June 1939, Romania launched its first native-built warship, the minelaying destroyer escort Amiral Murgescu, named in the honor of Major Murgescu (he became the first Romanian Admiral after the war), who distinguished himself during this action and throughout the rest of the Russo- Turkish War.Robert Gardiner, Warship 1991, Conway Maritime Press, 1991, p. 147 This victory ingrained the spar torpedo within the Romanian naval doctrine for the decades to come. As late as 1906, Romania ordered a class of eight vessels armed with spar torpedoes, however they were also fitted with torpedo dropping gear (carriages) amidships.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 422  References  Naval battles involving Romania Naval battles involving Russia Naval battles involving the Ottoman Empire Battles of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) Conflicts in 1877 ","title":"Action off MƒÉcin"},{"id":"55919773","title":"2002 Belgian Super Cup"},{"id":"55919819","text":"Rajesh Bishnoi (born 25 January 1990) is an Indian cricketer who plays for Rajasthan.

It was released on February 14, 2011, through IS Entermedia Group and distributed by LOEN Entertainment. Filled with songs revolving around love stories, the record was musically, conceptually, and visually conceived by the members of the group. Preceding its release, \\"Round 1\\" was released in September of the previous year as Dalmatian's introductory single. Dalmatian and its two lead singles \\"That Man Opposed\\" and \\"Lover Cop\\" were concurrently released on Valentine's Day. Dalmatian promoted the record through music chart programs across various television networks by performing both songs. The mini-album peaked at number 22 on South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart, selling over 5,700 copies since its release. Background In order to better communicate with fans and create an album with \\"emotional\\" music, Dalmatian decided to conceive a record with love stories. The group was able to freely determine the direction of its craft, including the music, lyrics, styling, concept, and theme. In addition to the tracks on the mini-album, the group wrote 60 other songs. The sextet practiced the choreography for their singles for three months. The title of the mini-album is a portmanteau of \\"dalmatian\\" and \\"musician\\". Artwork concept The cover art for Dalmatian showcases the six members set against a white background, with black spotted patterns overlaid them to resemble a dalmatian dog. The colors symbolize the \\"internal suffering\\" endured by the members for the years they spent training, while also signaling to a \\"bright\\" future. In the album photos, henna was applied on the faces of rap members Inati, Day Day, and Dari to accentuate an impression of strength; vocalists Jeesu, Daniel, and Youngwon donned smoky eye shadow to convey a \\"soft\\" and \\"mature\\" ambience. Music structure Described as being accompanied by a \\"sweet\\" melody and vocals, the opening track \\"Lover Cop\\" is a dance track which centers around a house beat and synthesizer. A guitar with an electronic rock sound was implemented into the refrain. The lyrics were written by Day Day, credited as David Kim, who was inspired by the film RoboCop (1987) to pen the song. The song was conceived as a result of the hypothetical question, \\"are robots also capable of feeling love?\\". The second track \\"That Man Opposed\\" is a hip hop-dance song compromising an \\"intense\\" beat and \\"moderate\\" piano. A story of unrequited love, it was inspired by Jeesu's middle school experience. Comparing the tracks to a dalmatian dog, the group felt that the former demonstrated a \\"black\\" feeling, while the latter's comical lyrics and \\"gentle and cute\\" appearance illustrated a \\"white\\" one. \\"Really Really\\" is a hip-hop track performed by rappers Inati, Day Day, and Dari. \\"Real Eyes\\" is a neo soul track with a simple jazz piano foundation. It is sung by vocalists Jeesu, Daniel, and Youngwon, with lyrics written by the former two. Serving as the closing track, \\"Round 1\\" is a dance song inspired by 1990s music. Alt URL Release and promotion Dalmatian released its debut single \\"Round 1\\" on September 1, 2010. Dalmatian was announced on January 2, 2011, with a scheduled release for the following month. Originally intending to release one lead single, group leader Inati expressed confidence in the music to simultaneously release a second. The music video teasers for the lead singles \\"That Man Opposed\\" and \\"Lover Cop\\" were directed by Jo Su-hyeon and unveiled on February 11. Dalmatian and the two music videos were concurrently released on Valentine's Day. On that day, the group held its Dalmatian 1st Mini Album Show showcase at Rolling Hall in the Seogyo-dong neighborhood of Hongdae. Dalmatian performed five songs in total, including both lead singles, and attracted between 200‚Äì300 attendees to the event. Dalmatian began promoting \\"That Man Opposed\\" and \\"Lover Cop\\" three days later on Mnet's music chart show M Countdown, followed by subsequent comeback performances on Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's (MBC) Show! Music Core, and Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) Inkigayo. Commercial performance On the chart dated February 13 ‚Äì 19, 2011, Dalmatian debuted at number 22 on South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart. By the end of the month, it shifted 2,933 units domestically. The mini-album ranked at number 202 on the year-end chart, selling 5,755 copies in 2011.

She is known for her openly queer relationship with fellow suffragette Annie Williams. Floyd and Williams were arrested and force fed. After the World War I Floyd continued to campaign for women's rights and peace. Life Floyd was born in Berkswell in 1865 to William and Alison Floyd. Her mother's sister was the philosopher Jane Hume Clapperton who had published Scientific Meliorism and the Evolution of Happiness in 1885. Their father was a farmer and when he died in 1879 he left ¬£3000 each to his two daughters. She became bored by not needing to work and in 1888 she took work in a children's hospital. She nursed the patients but was dispirited to realise that the symptoms she was treating were caused by larger issues including poverty and poor housing.Crawford, E. (2013-10-03). Floyd, Lettice Annie (1865‚Äì1934), suffragette. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 29 Nov. 2017, from http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-103440. She and her sister felt strongly about women's suffrage such that they set up a Berkswell outpost of the Birmingham Women's Suffrage Society in 1907. However by the following year they had both lost patience with the conventional means of lobbying on this issue and they joined the Women's Social and Political Union. This was a militant group set up in Manchester by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst. Cartoon of woman in suffragette colours smashing windows Floyd became a full time paid organiser for the WSPU and became romantically involved with another suffragette named Annie Williams. Floyd met Williams, in Bristol, who was on holiday campaigning for women's suffrage, from her role as an elementary school headteacher in Newquay, Cornwall. Floyd was organiser based either in Bristol or Newcastle. In March 1912 she went to the capital to assist in a WSPU window-smashing campaign. She was carrying a leather flail which is now in the Museum of London. She was arrested and sent to Holloway Prison where she went on hunger strike as the suffragettes did to protest at not being treated as political prisoners. Floyd was force fed by the prison authorities. Floyd had been given a WSPU Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour'. In 1910 Floyd and Williams were based in Newcastle when the Conciliation Bill, which would have included the right of women to vote was stopped on its passage into law by the Prime Minister. The WSPU arranged for 300 protesters and a deputation to the Prime Minister. The deputation was led by Emmeline Pankhurst and included Hertha Ayrton, Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Anne Cobden-Sanderson, and Princess Sophia Duleep Singh. The arrested suffragettes were assaulted and manhandled by the police, but the authorities refused to investigate what became known as Black Friday. Similarly Floyd was arrested on the day but no charges were brought against her. Floyd and Williams and Emily Davison were making open air speeches together in Cardiff, when Davison left for Aberdeen to assault David Lloyd George. The two stayed there until World War I began and the WSPU agreed a truce with the government over women's rights. Floyd returned to her home in Berkswell, near Coventry and Williams lived with her, where they started a branch of the Women's Institute. In 1918 some women were given the right to vote. Floyd joined the National Council of Women and of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom noting that women's right's and peace were the most important issues. Floyd died in 1934 after an operation with Annie Williams beside her. She left her money to create a nursing home and she left what is now called \\"Floyd's Field\\" as a sports facility to the city of Coventry. Annie died in 1943.

Portrayed by Jayden Daniels since 2015, Curtis has appeared on the show in 2 stints in both regular and recurring appearances. Creation and casting In 2015 producers decided to expand the role of guest-character Jack Hannah (Reuben Milner) and introduce a family unit around him. The character of his older brother Curtis was created and recent drama school graduate Jayden Daniels was cast in the role. Upon being cast, Daniels decided to stay as the role for what he thought would be around 2 years. The arrival was said to \\"ruffle a few feathers\\" amongst the characters, whilst Daniels enjoyed working alongside screen father Jarod Rawiri (Mo Hannah). After 18 months in the role, Daniels decided his, \\"dreams are bigger and I want to try other stuff\\" and quit the show. The resulting storyline saw Curtis imprisoned something which Daniels enjoyed despite acknowledging, \\"it is a bit sad but I like that there is a bit of drama around it.\\" Curtis departed the show on 1 November 2016. Daniels was happy with his stint as Curtis, believing he had, \\"been so lucky. He's had so many storylines, huge storylines. It's been crazy. I've been able to do so much cool stuff.\\" Due to the popularity of the character and ambiguity of his exit, producers decided to reintroduce Curtis in 2017. After auditioning in Los Angeles and starring in an Air New Zealand in-flight video, Daniels reprised his role in September 2017. Daniels described returning as \\"terrifying\\", \\"Just because it was something that had been so familiar to me for a year and a half, and then literally having none of this for more than eight months, coming back meant finding my feet again.\\" As a result of no success in his overseas auditions, Daniels committed to staying on as Curtis for \\"awhile longer\\". Daniels departed the role the following year. In 2020 Daniels was again asked to reprise the role due to fan reception of the character. He had expected his previous departure to be permanent but thought, \\"It‚Äôs been great, especially as I know how hard it is to consistently act in this country. It‚Äôs been great that I‚Äôve had that ‚Äì to be able to go back to Curtis.\\" The return saw a reunion with on-screen brother Reuben Milner who also returned to the soap. Daniels highlighted the development undergone throughout the character's time onscreen, \\"I‚Äôve done him for like three years screen-time wise, so I‚Äôm pretty used to how he is and how he reacts to things. He kind of has quite a bit of freedom because he came in as a bad boy and now he‚Äôs a cop, so he can kind of play both sides and that‚Äôs fun to do.\\" Storylines Following the diagnosis of leukaemia in the youngest sibling of the Hannah family Pixie (Thomasin MacKenzie), the eldest brother Curtis moved to Ferndale from Australia where he had recently served time in prison much to his father Mo's (Jarod Rawiri) anger. Taking a job at 'The I.V.' bar, Curtis struggled with money and took to drug dealing, cage fighting, and general criminal activities. He began dating bar owner Dayna (Lucy Elliott) but left her humiliated when it was revealed he had been having an affair with her flatmate Lucy (Grace Palmer). Following the death of Pixie, Curtis carried out a vindictive vendetta against the doctor he held responsible Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) but when Chris helped him escape jail time, Curtis decided to go straight. He started up a business with his best friend Ali (Tane Williams-Accra) and began dating Esther Samuels (Ngahuia Piripi). Curtis grew annoyed with Mo's girlfriend Victoria (Laura Thompson) and she subsequently framed him for the shooting of Drew McCaskill (Ben Barrington). Esther left Curtis for Finn Connelly (Lukas Whiting) despite his eventual proof of innocence. After many months, Curtis and Esther eventually reconnected but after realising his brother Jack (Reuben Milner) was storing class-A drugs, Curtis took the wrap and received a 5-year prison sentence. Whilst in jail, he broke up with Esther to spare her the pain of dating a convict. 10 months later Curtis returned to Ferndale with the news that as a recent law student, he had managed to be acquitted and have all charges wiped. Despite jealousy at Esther and Finn having reconciled, he made it clear he was still in love with her but began to date Dawn Robinson (Rebekah Palmer) before having a passionate affair with Sass Warner (Lucy Lovegrove). He experienced racial profiling from corrupt cop Clint Allen (Ryan Lampp) and eventually succeeded in getting him released from the police force. Curtis finally admitted he wanted Esther back on the day of her wedding, but was rejected, leading him to re-evaluate his life and join the police force. From 29 April, he has had 3 one-night stands with Becky, who happens to be the newly-wed wife of the Head of Ferndale Police, and Curtis' trainer-teacher, Tank. Becky split it off though, feeling bad and eventually confessed to Tank. Having Curtis at his mercy in a training exercise, Tank dropped Curtis, choosing not to save him as a lesson and a warning. From this point, Curtis and Tank would begin a feud. She later broke up with Tank, and starts a relationship with him. On 12 June, he completed his 2-year life turnaround when he graduates from police college and became a constable. However, his first case could be bringing down long time rival Finn Warner, who abused Esther Samuels the second time and broke her ribs. His first case on duty is with the returning Detective Darryl, who is his superior, and they went back to the Hannah's place to question a dumbfounded Jack, who had no idea that his med school classmate, Claire, was drunk-raped outside The I.V. Bar. However, as Kate was later assaulted, his attention turned to his nemesis - Former Sergeant Clint Allen, now as a taxi driver, transported many female patients fresh off new attacks. With him being pressured by his family, he tried to provoke Allen into confessions when he dines in the I.V. Bar, and was later formally laid complaint by Allen, prompting Darryl to possibly stand him down and take him off the case. After Allen died from a brutal attack of unknown reasons, they turned the attention to James White, who had a history of abusing his partner. However, he was only charged with minor burglary charges as he was burgling a shop during one of the attacks. After that, Curtis took leave to clear his head. He returned in September 2020 after Eddie Adams and Boogie found him in the bush, and mistaken him as The Creep. However, Curtis was actually undercover to undercover the identity of The Creep. His cover was blown when Boogie told Sophia King, who in turn told Esther as they were unaware of Esther and Curtis' history. Early October, Eddie put Curtis' life in further danger when The Creep, who turned out to be Simon Ashton the former surgeon turned chaplain. He removed Curtis' kidney and hurt Eddies' shoulder, before he was knocked unconscious by Boogie when he was kept in the car while waiting for Esther and Eddie. Curtis was in an induced coma as the wound was infected and has lost substantial amount of blood. He was extubated and regain consciousness. Character development =Relationship with Esther Samuels= In 2015 Curtis embarked on a relationship with young doctor Esther Samuels (Ngahuia Piripi). Daniels had a strong relationship with Piripi and he thought, \\"it helps on screen. If we couldn't get on off-screen, I think it would be hard to find that chemistry on screen.\\" Throughout 2016, Curtis actively tried to steal Esther from her boyfriend Finn (Lukas Whiting), eventually succeeding. Daniels thought Curtis and Finn's rivalry played out well, \\"Because we're such good friends, we can push each other further safely on screen\\". Despite the on-off nature of Curtis and Esther, Daniels believed, \\"they'll definitely end up together. They're each other's soul mate.\\" However Curtis' arrest saw the couple separated which \\"saddened\\" Daniels as well as Curtis, \\"It breaks his heart as well because I think she's his soulmate. He's really in love with her and they've just got together and then this happens and it's quite devastating.\\" Whilst Curtis spent time in jail, Esther reunited with Finn with Piripi stating she did, \\"genuinely believe that Esther loves both Curtis and Finn but, with Curtis, she just loved him more. I feel like with Esther and Finn, I think she's fighting feelings she's had there because she knows her feelings for Curtis are stronger.\\" As Finn and Esther planned to marry in March 2018, Curtis still believed \\"that he is the better man for her.\\" Piripi believed that Finn was the right choice for Esther, \\"There's always going to be that love that Curtis and Esther have ... It is that first love. It's that one that stole your heart. You realise as you drift apart, grow apart, you become different people but it's shared experiences, and shared history that really ties those people. I think Finn is something new and Esther sees a future in that rather than holding onto the nostalgia that is Curtis.\\" Reception The character of Curtis at first proved to be disliked by the public, with Daniels receiving abuse online but shortly into his stint this changed and saw the character become one of the most popular on the show, and landing him the description of \\"fan favourite\\". Daniels believed this was due to the ability for the audience to relate to Curtis as a result of his bad choices, \\"I base him on people I know and who I've had relationships with and come into contact with. I just pull from everyone I've known. I don't make up anything.\\" During Curtis' time in prison, Daniels was often approached with jokes from the public about escaping jail.

This church is part of the collection belonging to the World Heritage Site of churches and convents of Goa. History According to the legend, a small chapel was built in honor Our Lady of the Rosary as per orders of Afonso de Albuquerque, after he had received the message that Goa was conquered in 1510 by the Portuguese. This small chapel is said to have been designed, according to Gaspar Correia, by master-builder Ant√£o, Nogueira de Brito on the Monte Santo (Holy mountain) in Goa. Well 30 years later, many people were already living in Monte Santo and the Portuguese rulers recognized that settlement needs to establish a separate parish with its own Church. However, for the construction of the Church itself, here is a little information, it will be 1543 initiated ‚Äì together with the Church of Our Lady of the Candles () and the Chapel of Santa Catarina (). Thus, Goa was the capital of the Portuguese colony, the three parishes with three churches. The church of Our Lady of the Rosary built in 1544‚Äì1547 in fulfilment of a vow taken by Afonso de Albuquerque, that to the knowledge of the conquest of the city of Goa. It would have promised to build a chapel in honor Our Lady of the Rosary in the place where it was and is, at the top north-west of Monte Santo, near the road between Old Goa and Panaji. A letter from the municipality to the Portuguese king Jo√£o III dated 1548, another letter in turn dated 1549 should prove that the Church resulted from the enlargement of the original chapel, that the Church was \\"new built\\". The information about this construction is not clear, but according to a document dated1774, the officers of the kingdom were in the church. In a letter of 1548, to the king Jo√£o III of Portugal, the members of the Confraternity of Our Lady of the Rosary seem to indicate that the current church resulted from the enlargement of the chapel the original. In 1843 Panaji (New Goa) officially became the administrative headquarters of Portuguese India, replacing the city of Goa (which gradually came to be known as Old Goa or Goa Velha) and then renamed to New Goa. Due to church's location, it is located relatively far outside of the original city centre of Old Goa ‚Äì this church has not been changed in the church status since their building is de facto. In the course of the transfer of the capital from Old Goa to High building New Goa (today is Panaji), the Church importance was lost. The church was renovated in 1897‚Äì1899. Architecture The church of lady of Rosary in Old Goa. =Exterior= The church of Our Lady of the Rosary is considered to be the oldest preserved buildings in Old Goa. Also, she is the only building that still has a (mainly) medieval construction and architectural elements.

Sumatera Thawalib represented the modernist school of Islam in Indonesia, a strand of thought aimed at Islamic reform through heavy emphasis on the Qur'an and hadith, modern scientific education, and abolishing of non-orthodoxy, inspired by Islamic Modernism promoted by Muhammad Abduh.Menchik, 2017. pp.4 The term Sumatera Thawalib literally means \\"Students of Sumatra\\", and it was founded on January 15, 1919 as a result of meeting between the Muslim students of Padang Panjang, Parabek and Padang Japang. The aim of the organization was deepening of Islamic knowledge among the Muslim students. The organization had contributed substantially to the development of Islam in West Sumatra in the early 20th century.Daya, Burhaduddin. (1990) Gerakan Penbaharuan Pemikiran Islam Kasus Sumatera Thawalib. Yogyakarta: Tiara Wacana. pp.92. History =Origin= Sumatera Thawalib was originated from surau, an Islamic religious assembly ingrained within the Minangkabau society and tradition. This traditional educational institution was still surviving in the face of the newly-founded madrasahs which aimed for renewal in Islamic education. Among the first suraus which implemented the more modern educational system such as utilization of desk, chair and blackboard was Surau Jembatan Besi in Padang Panjang.Naim, 1990. pp.4-18. Surau Jembatan Besi was founded in 1914 by Abdullah Ahmad and Abdul Karim Amrullah, also known as Haji Rasul. After Ahmad moved to Padang, Haji Rasul inaugurated him as the successor of the leadership of the surau and brought many reforms. In 1915, a coop called Koperasi Pelajar was instituted by Haji Habib, and later it was expanded by Haji Hasyim. With the establishment of the coop, Surau Jembatan Besi was considered having open atmosphere and willing to accept innovative methods, as the concept of coop was brought from the West. In 1913, Zainuddin Labai Al-Yunusi returned to Padang Panjang after studying with Sheikh Abbas Abdullah in Padang Japang, Payakumbuh. Zainuddin became the teacher of Surau Jembatan Besi, and later in 1915 established his own religious school. Inspired by the system of Surau Jembatan Besi, Zainuddin invited several students of the surau and created an association known as Makaraful Ichwan in order to deepen the Islamic knowledge, solve the compatibility between Islam and science, and for the bonding and networking among the Muslim students. In 1918, through the network of Makaraful Ichwan, Zainuddin, Jalaluddin Thaib and Inyiak Mandua Basa renamed Koperasi Pelajar coop into Sumatera Thawalib, and expanded the scope of activity. This renaming was accompanied by the transformation of the surau itself, into Surau Sumetera Thawalib.Sumatera Thawalib, Sekolah Modern Islam Pertama di Indonesia. JPNN. Retrieved November 29, 2017. This reformation was also caught an attention of the youth organization Jong Sumatranen Bond, which recently established their branches in Bukittinggi and Padang. As Surau Jembatan Besi went through several reforms, in 1918 when Haji Rasul established Surau Sumatera Thawalib, many changes implemented in its predecessor was succeeded on the surau as well. Among the educational system adopted by Surau Sumatera Thawalib were the class system, reconstruction of curriculum and teaching methods, and textbooks teaching more general subjects. Shortly after, Surau Parabek which was founded by Sheikh Ibrahim Musa, also moved toward the reformation in the field of education, Surau Gadang Syeikh Abbas Abdullah become Sumatera Thawalib Padang Japang and this was followed by many other suraus as well. =Establishment= Surau Parabek was originally named Surau Muzakartul Ikhwan (or Jamiatul Ikhwan), and it was founded by Sheikh Ibrahim Musa on September 20, 1910. On January 15, 1919, at the surau belonged to Muhammad Jamil Jambek in Bukittingi, students of the Sumetera Thawalib and Parabek held a meeting. As a result, Sumetera Thawalib was established as the educational organization that connects the two suraus, with the aim of intensification of Islamic education in West Sumatra. The inauguration was attended by Abdullah Ahmad, Haji Rasul, Muhammad Thaib Ummar and Ibrahim Musa.Saerozi, Muh.

IJIMS, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies, Volume 4, Number 2, December 2014: 233-255. In 1921, Ibrahim Musa introduced the madrasah system into Surau Parabek emulating the one in Sumatera Thawalib. Subsequently, the surau had renamed itself into Sumatera Thawalib Parabek. This renaming had inspired several other suraus in Padang Japang, Maninjau and Batusangkar area into integration into Sumatera Thawalib system and applying similar educational system onto their respective suraus. =Political development and shutdown= Soon after the establishment, the organization had developed politically with the integration of all the suraus in West Sumatra, and they encouraged all the students in the suraus to form organizations that connect them all together. On January 22, 1922, at the invitation of the students of Sumatera Thawalib Padang Panjang, a meeting was held between the representatives of all schools of Sumatera Thawalib. The meeting decided to form a unity of Thawalib student organizations under a single Central Council with branches in the regions. The union is called the Student Union of Sumatera Thawalib and its center of activity was in Padang Panjang. In 1923, with the influence of Djamaluddin Tamin and Datuk Batuah, communism was brought to the union and attracted the hearts of the disciples of Sumatera Thawalib. This new idea was thoroughly opposed by the lecturers of the organization, especially Haji Rasul who was then a professor. These political developments had led to the shutdown of the organization by the Dutch East Indies colonial government in 1928.Sumatera Thawalib, Sekolah Islam Modern Pertama di Indonesia.

It is known from a depth range of , including a capture at , which is possibly the record for a fish caught on the seafloor. Various anatomical, physiological, molecular and genetic adaptions help this species survive in such depths. This pale, tadpole-like fish reaches up to in standard length and in weight. It is apparently the top predator along certain stretches of the Mariana Trench, it feeding on tiny crustaceans in a deep- water habitat with few larger predators. Pseudoliparis swirei are abundant in their deep-sea habitat and lay relatively large eggs that are almost in diameter. Discovery The first specimens of this species were caught during the expedition of the research vessel Falkor. To catch the fish, deep-water traps designed to minimize the damage to the caught fish during the ascent were used. Mackerel was used as bait. The first representative of this species was caught on November 15, 2014. In the next 10 days another 35 were caught. Another representative of this species was caught on January 29, 2017, during the expedition of the research ship Shinyo-maru. The holotype of the species is the immature specimen USNM 438975 / HADES 200060, caught on November 21, 2014, at a depth of . Depth record and adaptions This species is known from a depth range of , including a capture at . This is possibly the depth record for a fish caught on the seafloor. Abyssobrotula galatheae has generally been recognized as the record-holder based on one caught at the seafloor at , but it might have been caught with a non-closing net (a net that is open on the way up and down into the deep) and therefore was perhaps shallower. Another contender is Echiodon neotes, captured at , but this was likely from open water (not at the seafloor). Only one other species of fish has been recorded from depths in excess of , the so-called ethereal snailfish (living in the same region as Pseudoliparis swirei but somewhat deeper), but it has only been seen on film and remain undescribed. Due to the extreme pressure, appears to be around the theoretical maximum depth possible for fish. Compared to shallow-water snailfish, Pseudoliparis swirei has several unusual adaptions for its dark and high pressure habitat, including transparent skin that lacks pigment, certain organs and eggs that are enlarged, the muscles are thinner, the ossification of its bones (notably the skull) is incomplete, it appears to have little or no ability to see, there are mechanisms that allow proteins in its body to still function, and differences in the cell membranes for maintaining their flexibility. Etymology Pseudoliparis swirei is named for Herbert Swire, the First Navigating Sub-Lieutenant of and author of 'The Voyage of the Challenger, a personal narrative of the historic circumnavigation of the globe in the years 1872-1876'. In 1876 the expedition found the Challenger Deep, habitat of the Mariana snailfish. Reproduction A study of mature females showed that mature eggs of this fish species are unusually large, up to in diameter. In total, there were up to 23 mature eggs for each female (each larger than in diameter), which were alternated with immature, small eggs, the number of which was about 850. Eggs of intermediate size were rarely seen. Even in the largest eggs, no structures were found that indicate the development of the embryo within the eggs.

Subsequent excavations took place in 1961 and 1961 by archaeologists from the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities. In 2009 the site was surveyed. New excavations were started in 2010, with subsequent seasons taking place in 2011, 2013, and 2014. The survey and the 2010-2014 excavations were undertaken by a team from the University of Heidelberg. The oldest excavated layers date to the third millennium BC and are contemporary with the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. A small temple dates to the Akkadian period. Large houses and tombs were recovered from the second millennium BC occupation layers. Occupation continued into the Late Bronze Age. Material culture from these layers showed links with the Hurrian and Kassite cultures. Iron Age occupation at Bakr Awa dates to the Neo-Assyrian period and the Achaemenid Empire. A Sassanian occupation at Bakr Awa is likely, but hasn't been proven beyond doubt. Islamic period occupation ranges from the Abbasid period into the Ottoman period. The site continues to be occupied today. Economy In the Early Dynastic period, the economy was nomadic and based on sheep and goat (74.1 %), mainly killed for meat. There were also remains of cattle and more rarely equids.PiƒÖtkowska-Ma≈Çecka 2015 In the Akkadian period, the economy shifted from nomadic to more sedentary and pastoral, introducing new elements as pig and poultry breeding as well as wild animal hunting.PiƒÖtkowska-Ma≈Çecka 2015 Gallery File:September 18, 2014.

At approximately 16:10 local time on 21 April 2011, two unknown men shot Bozzi eight times as she returned to her car which was parked outside a shopping centre in Porticcio; she died at the scene. Although the killers remained unknown as of 2012, Yves Bordenave writing for the French newspaper Le Monde reported that the killing marked the first time that an elected female politician had been assassinated in Corsica, and suspected that the death was a r√®glement de compte (translated as score-settling). Bozzi's murder has been linked to in-fighting within the Southern Corsican mafia following the death of its head, Jean-J√©r√¥me Colonna, known as Jean J√©, in 2006. Bozzi's brother, Ange-Marie Michelosi, was one of Colonna's friends and was murdered in 2008; Bozzi and other members of her clan believed Alain Orsoni was responsible and suspected him (a former nationalist militant who had returned from self-imposed exile in South America) of vying to succeed Colonna. The police intervened and secured a short-lived truce, but in 2009 another Bozzi family associate, Thierry Castola, was murdered and the truce fell apart. The police intervened once more: Bozzi, her husband and her brother Jean-Toussaint were arrested, although Bozzi herself was soon released; Orsoni was also arrested on suspicion of Castola's murder, but released after 10 months in prison.

The Korean seahorse is the most common seahorse in Korean waters so that the scientific name 'haema' is named from 'seahorse' in Korean. The Japanese name 'Himetatsu' is derived from its smaller shape such as body and coronet rather than the shape of a sister species, crowned seahorse (Hippocampus coronatus). This species had been repeatedly misidentified as crowned seahorse and Shiho's seahorse before a taxonomic review. However, the two genuine species do not live in Korean waters, therefore this species was handled by naming a new scientific name, Hippocampus haema. It can grow to lengths of 11 centimeters, but more commonly 6 to 8 centimeters as adult. Namely, the length of juvenile is 1 to 5 centimeters, whereas and the lengths of males and females reaching sexual maturity are considered as ca. 5 centimeters with or without male brood pouch.

There is a basic format but there are many variations while playing the songs. Korean traditional music is usually singing within the Jangdan played by Janggu or eastern drum. This accompaniment is called 'hitting the Jangdan'. But in music mainly composed by percussion instrument like Korean traditional folk music, it is called 'hitting the steel' or 'hitting the Pungmul(ÌíçÎ¨º)' which is a Korean traditional folk music. Jangdan can be categorized into two groups: Jeong-Ak (Formal music) Jangdan and Min- Sok-Ak (traditional folk music) Jangdan.  How to read Jangdan  centerWhen playing janggu, usually chae is used by right hand, and nothing on left. However, while playing outdoor music or Samul nori, people use gung chae with their left hand. Also, it is general to hit the middle side of the chae side, but exceptionally, corner of the chae side with small volume is used while playing solo or indoor music.  Jeong-Ak (Formal music) Jangdan  Jangdan used in Jeong-Ak is usually played by Janggu. It is often used in Jangdan in Young-San-Hoe-Sang(ÈùàÂ±±ÊúÉÁõ∏).

There are many combinations of rhythms in slow Jeong-Ak Jangdan, and many Doduri in normal speed Jangdan, and many Ta-ryoung in fast Jangdan. = Sang-Young-San Jangdan = Sang-Young-San Jangdan is a very slow 10-beat tempo. If one beat is considered as a half note, the Jangdan is a 10/2 beat tempo, and if considered a quarter note, the Jangdan is a 10/8+8+8 beat tempo. Sometime it is considered 20 beat tempo for very slow music. The Sang-Young- San Jangdan is used in the first and middle part of the Young-San-Hoe- Sang(ÈùàÂ±±ÊúÉÁõ∏), 1~3 chapter of Yeo-Min-Rak(ËàáÊ∞ëÊ®Ç), 1~4 chapter of Bo-Heo-Sa/Bo-Heo- Ja(Ê≠•ËôõÂ≠ê). = Se-Ryoung-San Jangdan = Se-Ryoung-San Jangdan is a 10 beat tempo, similar to Sang-Young-San Jangdan, but a bit faster so it has many variations. It is used in Se-young-San in Young-San-Hoe-Sang, Ga-Rak-Deo-Ri, 4~7 chapter of Yeo-Min-Rak, and 5~7 chapter of Bo-Heo-Sa/Bo-Heo-Ja(Ê≠•ËôõÂ≠ê). = Doduri Jangdan = Doduri Jangdan is the most used Jangdan in Jeong-Ak(formal music), a 6 beat tempo in normal speed. It has many variations that depends on the song. = Chee-Ta Jangdan = Chee-Ta Jangdan is used in marching music.

Music with Dodley jangdan gives us grave and strong feelings. Dodley of eight-eighteen times or six-four times used in Yeongsan-Hoesang, and Dodley of six-two times used in pansori like Chunmyeongog or Jugjisa.

Jajinmori jangdan is fast eight-twelve times jangdan which is played in pansori or sanjo. We can play its 3beats together as one time, and this case one jangdan is same as 4times. Music with Jajinmori jangdan gives us active and enchanting feelings. Jajinmori jangdan is usually played in pansori, sanjo, nongak and Muga, especially dramatic and urgent parts.

She was the √∂verhovm√§starinna to queen Christina of Sweden from 1639 until 1642. Biography She was the daughter of nobleman Peder Ryning and Kerstin Gyllenstierna. In 1625, she married nobleman colonel G√∂ran Soop (d. 1631). Prior to her marriage, she served as kammarfr√∂ken to the queen dowager of Sweden, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. =Courtier= After the death of the queen's foster mother and aunt Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw a need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch (her mother being exiled), which resulted in a reorganization of the queen's household. In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in- waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, in 1639 Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag was appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title Upptuktelse-F√∂rest√•nderska ('Castigation Mistress'), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was appointed to share the position of head lady- in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of Hovmastarinna.Marie- Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62 This signified a permanent reorganization of the Swedish Royal Household: previously, there had been only one Mistress of the Robes with the title Hovm√§starinna ('Court Mistress'), but now, Beata Oxenstierna was additionally given the newly invented title of √ñverhovm√§starinna ('Chief Court Mistress'), and from the reign of Christina onward, there were to be one or two Hovm√§starinna and one √ñverhovm√§starinna at the Swedish Royal Court. Ebba Leijonhufvud was the mother-in-law to the son of the Regent of the Guardian Government, Axel Oxenstierna, and Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was also connected to the Oxenstierna Party, which is believed to have played a part in their appointments.Erik Petersson: Maktspelerskan : drottning Kristinas revolt (2011) The Royal Council's method of giving queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person seems to have been effective: Christina does not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and does not seem to have formed any attachment to either of them, nor do they seem to have played any part at court after their term in service ended. With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any her female courtiers whatsoever, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than them.Marie-Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) page 62 In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor M√§rta Ulfsparre: :\\"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now.

The rivalry between her suitors ultimately escalated into a war involving the Rajput rulers of Udaipur, Jodhpur, and Jaipur; as well as Daulat Rao Sindhia of Gwalior, Yashwant Rao Holkar of Indore and Amir Khan Pindari of Tonk. In 1810, when Amir Khan Pindari attacked Udaipur on behalf of Man Singh, 16-year old Krishna agreed to be poisoned to death, to put an end to the war. Early life Krishna Kumari was one of the several daughters of Bhim Singh, the Rajput ruler of the Udaipur princely state in the Mewar region. In 1799, at the age of 5, she was engaged to Bhim Singh, the Rajput ruler of the Jodhpur State in the Marwar region. However, the groom-to-be died prematurely in 1803.  Conflict among suitors  After the death of Bhim Singh of Jodhpur, his cousin Man Singh succeeded him on the throne. Man Singh revoked an appanage that his predecessor had granted to Kishan Singh, a relative of Krishna's father Bhim Singh. This annoyed Krishna's father, Bhim Singh of Udaipur. Krishna's father arranged her engagement with Jagat Singh, the Rajput ruler of the Jaipur State. Jagat Singh had become an adversary of Man Singh by supporting a rival claim to the throne of Jodhpur. Man Singh argued that Krishna was engaged to the ruler of Jodhpur, and therefore, should be married to him instead of Jagat Singh. Krishna's father rejected Man Singh's demand, and sent representatives to Jaipur to finalize her engagement with Jagat Singh. = Sindhia's intervention = Man Singh then threatened to invade Mewar, and enlisted the support of Daulat Rao Sindhia, the Maratha ruler of the Gwalior State, by paying a tribute. With help of Sindhia's commander Sarjerao Ghatge, Man Singh threatened Amar Singh of Shahpura, a feudatory of Bhim Singh of Udaipur. At this time Bhim Singh's representatives were passing through Shahpura on their way to Jaipur, and Man Singh forced Amar Singh to send them back to Udaipur. Subsequently, Sindhia personally intervened in the dispute, hoping to play an active role in the Rajput politics. He advised Krishna's father Bhim Singh to give one of his daughters in marriage to Man Singh of Jodhpur and another to Jagat Singh of Jaipur. Sindhia also recommended that if the two suitors rejected this proposal, the dispute be resolved by involving the neighbouring rulers as arbitrators. By this time, Jagat Singh's forces had reached Udaipur, which emboldened Bhim Singh into rejecting Sindhia's proposal. Sindhia then invaded the Udaipur kingdom, and forced Bhim Singh into signing a treaty at Nathdwara on 7 May 1806. At one point, Sindhia himself offered to marry Krishna, but the Rajputs disapproved of this proposal. Baiza Bai, one of Sindhia's wives, also opposed the proposal, arguing that the Rajputs would not agree to such a marriage without warfare. Sindhia later withdrew his proposal to marry Krishna. Yashwant Rao Holkar, the Maratha ruler of the Indore State and a rival of Sindhia, also decided to take advantage of this conflict to demand tributes from the Rajputs. This irked Krishna's father Bhim Singh, who refused to pay tribute to either of the Maratha rulers. Sindhia retreated from the Udaipur kingdom, fearing hostility from the Rajputs as well as Holkar. = Holkar's intervention = After Sindhia's retreat, Holkar offered to arbitrate the dispute. He advised that Krishna Kumari be married to someone other than Man Singh and Jagat Singh, but with the consent of these two rulers; in addition, Jagat Singh would marry a sister of Man Singh. However, Jagat Singh rejected this proposal, and insisted on marrying Krishna. Subsequently, he signed an agreement with Holkar, who promised not to object to his marriage to Krishna, and to support Jaipur against a possible attack from Sindhia. Later, Jagat Singh also won Sindhia over to his side by promising him 1 million rupees. In addition, he enlisted the support of Surat Singh of Bikaner State and Amir Khan Pindari of Tonk State. Man Singh tried to win over Holkar to his side, but Holkar decided to remain neutral. = Outbreak of war = The dispute over Krishna was being closely monitored by the East India Company. The Company's Accountant General Henry St George Tucker, in a March 1806 letter to George Robinson, had mentioned that the Rajput kings were about to \\"take up arms for the purpose of deciding their claims to the fair hand of the Princess\\". Tucker expressed the possibility of a conflict involving the Rajput states, as well as Sindhia and Holkar, which would \\"make a very desirable diversion\\" in the favour of the Company. As predicted by Tucker, the conflict between Krishna's suitors ultimately escalated into a full-fledged war. Jagat Singh marched against Jodhpur, and declared Bhim Singh's posthumous son Dhonkal Singh as the rightful ruler of Jodhpur. He also convinced Holkar to remain neutral by offering a payment of 1 million rupees. Although Jagat Singh suffered some initial reverses, his army ultimately besieged Jodhpur in May 1807. Man Singh escaped to Jalore, and unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance with the East India Company. Soon after this, Jagat Singh's army was forced to leave Jodhpur because of scarcity of water, and because of defections by several Rathores, Sarjerao Ghatge and Amir Khan. In January 1808, Jagat Singh's pro-Holkar minister Ratan Lal tried to secure Holkar's support by offering a tribute of 1 million rupees, but Holkar declined the offer. Under his influence, Jagat Singh refused to pay a tribute to Sindhia, which prompted Sindhia to invade Jaipur and extract a heavy tribute. Sindhia also attacked Udaipur, and defeated the forces of Krishna's father Bhim Singh. = Man Singh - Amir Khan's invasion = Amir Khan, who had defected to Man Singh's side for money, helped consolidated Man Singh's control over the throne of Jodhpur. In April 1810, Amir Khan demanded tribute from Udaipur and Jaipur, and invaded Udaipur. At that time, the prominent nobles of Udaipur were fighting among themselves for political power, and therefore, Udaipur forces could not put up a strong defence. Amir Khan devastated and burned the villages of the Udaipur kingdom. He then sent a message to Krishna's father Bhim Singh demanding that Krishna be either married to Man Singh or killed, because as long as she lived, there would be no peace. He threatened to destroy Bhim Singh's kingdom if this demand was not met. Death According to a contemporary British account published in the Asiatic Annual Register for 1810-11, Amir Khan came up with the suggestion to poison Krishna \\"as the only mode of at once settling all their pretensions, and terminating the ten years' war, which this second Helen had excited.\\" The Sisodia nobles of Mewar, who considered the Rathore clan of Jodhpur inferior in status, also advised Bhim Singh that it was better to let Krishna die than suffer the supposed dishonour of having her married to Man Singh. Bhim Singh determined that his daughter's death was necessary for establishing peace, and Krishna agreed to die by poisoning. She died of poisoning on 21 July 1810. The Asiatic Annual Register report states that her aunt administered poison to her, with the knowledge of her father. The report describes her death as \\"the most important political event which has lately occurred in Hindustan\\". After Krishna's death, Amir Khan, the Chundawat chiefs and the Marathas fought among themselves for control of Mewar. The Udaipur State ultimately sought help from the British, and agreed to become a British protectorate in January 1818. The other parties involved in the conflict also accepted British suzerainty within a decade of her death. News of the Princess Reaches London The circumstances of the princess's death were introduced to the British public by Major-General Sir John Malcolm in ‚ÄòA Memoir of Central India', 1824.Eclectic Review, VOL. XXII, July-December 1824, p. 128.

He states that his account was drawn from several persons who were on the spot at the time and he gives the princess's name as Kishen Kower. Another source of information in Britain was Muhammad Amir Khan, an active participant as noted above, whose memoirs were translated from the Persian and published in 1832. He gives her name as Kishen Koomaree (probably the correct historical pronunciation of Kumari). Amir Khan's account of her final moments states that: 'Accordingly having bathed, and dressed herself in new and gay attire, she drank off the poison, and so gave up her precious life, earning the perpetual praise, and admiration of mankind.'Memoirs of the Puthan Soldier of Fortune the Nuwab Ameer-Ood-Doulah Mohummud Ameer Khan, Chief of Seronj, Tonk, Rampoora, Neemahera, and Other Places in Hindoostan.

Richardson, 1828, pp.109-112.. This is a fragment and only deals with Kishen Kower's death and what followed. Letitia Elizabeth Landon tells the story within The Zenana, again under the heading Kishen KowerFisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834. pp. 21-24. (and giving apologises for the anachronism, as the main action of this long poem is set much earlier). She introduces the princess's taking of the poison with the lines: * And the blood of her race rushes dark to her brow, The spirit of heroes has entered her now. 'Bring the death-cup, and never for my sake shall shame Quell the pride of my house, or dishonour its name.' M√°ire ni Fhlath√∫in also includes versions by Anna Maria Mowatt (Kishen Kowur), Henry Thoby Prinsep (Kishen Koomaree, Princess of Oodeepoor) and Lieut.-Col. G.

She was the royal governess of queen Christina of Sweden from 1639 until 1642. Biography Christina Natt och Dag was the only daughter of four children to nobleman Nils Nilsson Natt och Dag (1554-1613), chamberlain at the royal court, and Anna Bengtsdotter Gylta (1550-1603). She married royal governor nobleman Holger von Scheiding (1583-1631). Her eldest brother Pehr Nilsson Natt och Dag (1583-1634) was a member of the Council and her middle brother Ivar Nilsson Natt och Dag (1590-1651) was a royal governor. =Court life= After the death of the queen's foster mother and aunt Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw a need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch (her mother being exiled), which resulted in a reorganization of the queen's household. In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, in 1639 Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag was appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title Upptuktelse-F√∂rest√•nderska ('Castigation Mistress'), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of Hovm√§starinna.Marie-Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62 This signified a permanent reorganization of the Swedish Royal Household: previously, there had been only one Mistress of the Robes with the title Hovm√§starinna ('Court Mistress'), but now, Beata Oxenstierna was additionally given the newly invented title of √ñverhovm√§starinna ('Chief Court Mistress'), and from the reign of Christina onward, there were to be one or two Hovm√§starinna and one √ñverhovm√§starinna at the Swedish Royal Court. The choice of Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag to the office of foster mother was officially motivated by their mutually reputed qualities of \\"honesty and virtue, seriousness and steadfastness\\",Erik Petersson: Maktspelerskan : drottning Kristinas revolt (2011) and in the case of Leijonhufvud in particular, her ideally educated daughter Anna Margareta was noted as an example of the great ability of her mother in raising a child. In reality, however, Ebba Leijonhufvud was the mother-in-law to the son of the Regent of the Guardian Government, Axel Oxenstierna, by that very same daughter, and Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was also connected to the Oxenstierna Party, which is believed to have played a part in their appointments. Christina Natt och Dag, for her part, had good connections belonging to a family of court officials, her paternal grandmother Karin Gyllenstierna having been the chief lady-in-waiting to queen Catherine Jagiellon and princess Anna Vasa of Sweden, and her father having had a number of court offices, as well as her eldest brother being a member of the Council and her stepmother having been princess Sigrid of Sweden (1566‚Äì1633). The Royal Council's method of giving queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person seems to have been effective: Christina dies not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and does not seem to have formed any attachment to either of them, nor do they seem to have played any part at court after their term in service ended. With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any her female courtiers whatsoever, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than them.Marie-Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) page 62 In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor M√§rta Ulfsparre: :\\"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now.

Lisziewicz headed many research teams that have discovered and produced immunotheraputic drugs to treat diseases like cancer and chronic infections like HIV/AIDS. Some of these drugs have been successfully used in clinical trials.  Education  Lisziewicz graduated from Budapest University of Technology in Budapest, Hungary with an MSc in Chemistry and Biology in 1982. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology at the Max-Planck Institute in Germany. Lisziewicz did post doctoral research at the Max-Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine from 1985-1989.  Career  = National Institutes of Health = Lisziewicz worked at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1989-1995. During her time working at the National Cancer Institute she was the Head of the Antiviral Unit at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology. = Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy (RIGHT) = In 1995, Lisziewicz and her colleague Franco Lori founded the Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy (RIGHT), where Lisziewicz worked as the Director. RIGHT is a non- profit organization based in the United States and Italy that funds research to develop immunologic technologies, create new therapies, and research vaccines for many chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS. RIGHT strives to quickly put their discoveries to use in patient treatments. = Genetic Immunity, Inc. = Lisziewicz founded Genetic Immunity, Inc., and worked as the President and the CEO of the company. Genetic Immunity is a private clinical-stage biotechnology company in the United States and Hungary. Genetic Immunity works to create and commercialize immunotherapeutic biologics to treat chronic viral infections, allergies, and cancers to prolong the life of the patient and improve their quality of life. = TREOS Bio = TREOS Bio is a company that develops precision vaccines to treat and prevent cancer using computational immune- oncology. Lisziewicz worked as the Chief Scientific Officer of TREOS Bio.  Research  = Antisense oligonucleotides = While working at the National Institute of Health, Lisziewicz worked to find a gene therapy approach to treat HIV/AIDS. She based her research on discovering if small portions of gene-stopping DNA (called antisense oligonucleotides) could be created to bind up the viral RNA in retroviruses like HIV so that the virus could not make more copies of itself to continue the infection. Small pieces of messenger RNA (or mRNA) carry a copy of the cell's DNA to the ribosomes where the mRNA directs the ribosomes to create the proteins that the cells need. Viruses (like HIV) have their own set of mRNA, and they use the ribosomes of the cell they infected to make new viruses to propagate the infection throughout the body. Lisziewicz's idea was to create antisense oligonucleotides that are complementary to the HIV's viral mRNA. These complementary DNA pieces can bind to the HIV viral mRNA and prevent the HIV virus from replicating itself. The use of antisense oligonucleotides worked very well in cell cultures, and was quickly transferred to clinical trials. = DermaVir = DermaVir immunotherapy was created during Lisziewicz's research at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. She worked to produce gene and antisense therapies to treat HIV/AIDS, and researched how the immune system controls HIV in tissue culture and in monkey models. She applied these results to the treatment of HIV patients in clinical trials. Lisziewicz discovered and headed the preclinical and clinical development of DermaVir HIV immunotherapy. Under Lisziewicz's direction, DermaVir successfully completed a Phase 2 clinical trial. DermaVir is a topical vaccine that is applied with a patch to the skin. It is a new immunization strategy that uses dendritic cells to increase viral antigen production. DermaVir contains a plasmid that expresses all of the HIV proteins except integrase. This stimulates an immune response to attack the cells infected with HIV. DermaVir has been proven safe and immunogenic in several clinical trials, one of which was in collaboration with the Division of AIDS (DAIDS). In one trial, Lisziewicz's research team compared the immunogenicity of topical-based and ex vivo dendritic cell-based DermaVir in rhesus macaques. As a result, it was discovered that both vaccinations induced CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory T cells that are specific to simian immunodeficiency virus. The CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory T cells were identified using an in vivo skin test and an in vitro intracellular cytokine- based assay. The topical DermaVir vaccine is an improvement upon the ex vivo dendritic cell- based immunization that could offer a new alternative therapy for patients with HIV. = PolyPEPI‚Ñ¢ = An investigation Lisziewicz was involved with when she was working at TREOS Bio is how human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes regulate immune responses. This research led to the development of a computational immune-oncology technology that can determine a patient's natural T cell response to tumor antigens. As a result, TREOS Bio found there was a correlation between a patient's HLA gene sequence and how well their immunotherapies worked. PolyPEPI‚Ñ¢ immunotherapies to treat a number of cancer indications were created by TREOS Bio using the computational immune-oncology. = Langerhans cell-targeting DNA vaccines = Langerhans cells are a natural agent of antigen release. They are the precursors of dendritic cells in the skin and mucosa. Lisziewicz and her team developed synthetic nanoparticles that act like pathogens and specially target Langerhans cells in epidermal cell cultures. When these nanoparticles are applied topically to human subjects, a strong immune response was observed. This vaccine has been clinically proven, and it opens the door for more new dendritic cell-targeting vaccines to be created for the treatment of cancers.

At its peak, it had spawned competitors, including Altra Kits, Sundown Kits, Holubar Carikits, Plain Brown Wrapper Kits, and EMS (Eastern Mountain Sports) Kits. In 1978, the company was acquired by Gilette. Gillette had little success in the segment. It liquidated the company in 1983. In 1984, Insport of Grand Junction, Colorado bought the Frostline name and intellectual property from Gillette and resumed sales of kits. In 2000, Insport failed. In 2000 the company reorganized as Frostline Kits USA, LLC, also based in Grand Junction. Between 2007 and 2009, that company ceased operations. Products Frostline began with kits for parkas and sleeping bags. The range of products eventually extended to backpacks and other textile gear. These kits offered do-it- yourselfers a chance to save 50% from the cost of manufactured goods.

Carrie got up to ask a question on this subject and she was thrown out of the hall. The bouncers had assumed she was one of the suffragettes who were heckling Churchill's meetings. The mistake of the bouncers was mirrored by WSPU members who also assumed that her question to Churchill was part of a campaign. The WSPU were a militant organisation involved in increasing criminal protests to draw attention to their cause. They asked Carrie to join them but she did not feel it was possible. However she was a supporter and in 1912 she began the risky task of looking after WSPU members who were travelling in the area. Her respectable middle class profile meant that her house was not an obvious suspect for housing what the authorities considered criminals. Carrie was asked to keep her visitors' identities secret and she kept her word. Even after the first and the second world war she would not reveal who led the WSPU in Dundee. It is known that she once expected to house Emmeline Pankhurst in 1914 but Pankhurst was arrested in Glasgow before she got to Carrie's house.

In March 2016, Martin issued the first judicial approval in Canada for a person requesting assisted death after the Supreme Court's decision in Carter v Canada (AG). She allowed the assisted death for a woman diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and held the hearing closed to the public and media to respect her privacy. Martin decided that statements in support of the application from two doctors were sufficient, a decision which rejected guidelines from the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice that more statements were required. Martin also held that no psychiatric assessment on the day of death was necessary, and that the applicant's request should not fail on technical or legalistic grounds. Martin also ruled that the ruling would apply across Canada, which allowed the applicant to travel out of province in order to fulfill her wish of assisted death.

Often called ‚ÄúCaptain Crackers‚Äù or ‚ÄúOld Captain Cracker,‚Äù he is best known for his actions against the English Royal African Company and for his brief involvement with Bartholomew Roberts. History Leadstone was hired by the Royal African Company in the early 1700s at their factory on Bunce Island at the mouth of the Sierra Leone River. He soon deserted, stealing over a thousand bars of iron, and helped pilot a French force upriver in 1704 which bombarded the Bunce factory. Captured by natives after he began illicitly trading on his own, he was freed by the Portuguese, whom he served for a time. The Portuguese Governor at Cacheo (in Gambia) gave him a trading mission but Leadstone repeated his earlier tactics: he stole the trade goods, murdered a man, and escaped to Sierra Leone. He passed the time raiding ashore from small boats, in one 1715 incident stealing slaves from a local settlement. Later he would be described as ‚Äúformerly a noted Buccaneer, and while he followed the Calling, robb'd and plundered many a Man.‚Äù He gained his ‚ÄúOld Cracker‚Äù nickname after he moved to Whiteman's Bay, just down the river from Bunce Island. He kept his vessels ‚Äì several small boats and a periagua - as well as native slaves and servants, and welcomed pirates who came to trade. Captain Charles Johnson wrote that Leadstone ‚Äúkeeps the best House in the Place, has two or three Guns before his Door, with which he Salutes his Friends, (the Pyrates, when they put in) and lives a jovial Life with them, all the while they are there.‚Äù Another writer described him in glowing terms: ‚ÄúHe was the soul of hospitality and good fellowship, and kept open-house for all pirates, buccaneers, and privateersmen.‚Äù Leadstone was among at least 30 former pirates who traded goods to passing ships in need of resupply. They also supplied slaves and ivory to merchants who avoided the Royal African Company's trading monopoly. At least one of the slaves Leadstone sold, a man named Tomba, led an unsuccessful mutiny aboard a Bristol slave ship in 1721. Bartholomew Roberts arrived off the Guinea coast in June 1721. He visited Leadstone, who warned him that the Royal Navy warships HMS Swallow and HMS Weymouth were in the vicinity on a mission to stamp out piracy. Leadstone cautioned Roberts that the naval vessels were expected back by Christmas, and Roberts planned his route accordingly. Unknown to either of them, sickness among their crews caused the two Navy ships to put in at nearby Cape Coast Castle instead; sailing out in February 1722, they captured Roberts‚Äô fellow captains James Skyrme and Thomas Sutton and after a brief battle at sea, killed Roberts himself.

She was the first female to be a member of the German Society for Surgery and contributed to surgical advancements in Germany and Sweden.  Education and career  Johanna Hellman was born in Nuremberg, German Empire on 14 June 1889. In 1912 she attended medical school at the University of Berlin where she was trained under the German physician Hans Virchow. Hellman later returned to medical school at the University of Kiel, where she received specialized training to become a surgeon. After the start of World War I that year, she worked in the University of Kiel Hospital, completing her final licensing exam and wrote her doctoral thesis. She remained in Kiel during the war and assisted with the care of injured soldiers. In 1912, she joined the Northwest German Surgical Society and began filling in for surgeons at various municipal hospitals. Hellman became the first female member of the German Society for Surgery in 1925. From 1929 to 1938 she worked as a surgeon, radiologist, and urologist at the Charit√© clinic in Berlin. At this time, she became assistant to Ferdinand Sauerbruch, the head of surgery at the university clinic. Hellman also became director of a Salvation Army hospital during this time period, introducing a surgical division to the maternity ward of a Salvation Army hospital. She was forced to resign from her roles as head doctor in 1938 due to Nazi discrimination laws. Hellman emigrated to Stockholm, Sweden, but could not work as a surgeon because of her refugee status. She was able to work as a nanny and spent her time learning Swedish. In 1944, she became an assistant in the Surgical Hospital of Eskilstuna and was authorized to form a private practice three years later. In 1947, Hellman managed her private practice at the Red Cross Hospital, working as an abdominal surgeon. Hellman and Dr. Willy Ansch√ºtz conducted research and published papers regarding radiation as a treatment of breast cancer. On or around this time in Hellman's life, it has been documented that she was in correspondence with Lisa Meitner as well. She was still working at age 86, but little is known of her subsequent life.Ogilvie & Harvey, pp. 1179‚Äì80 Hellman died in 1982 in Stockholm.  Family  Johanna Hellman was sister to Sophie Hellman (c. 1894‚Äì1979) who was also involved in German Healthcare as a nurse in World War I. Her father was David Hellman, a merchant, and her mother was Fanny n√©e Kromwell of the Kromwell family of Gunzenhausen. Johanna Hellman was a mother to Irmgard Ahrendt, who she adopted during her time as a physician in Kiel during World War I. The young girls father was injured in the war, however, soon after his recovery he won back custody of his child. In 1938, during her time as a nanny, Hellman adopted another child. She cared for one family's fourth child full-time and eventually adopted the little girl. The adoption did not become official until 1966.

The Rotunda was built at the initiative of American artist John Vanderlyn to display panoramic paintings. According to historians Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, Vanderlyn was motivated by the refusal of the city's cultural elite to include paintings such as his nude Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos in public exhibitions on the grounds that it was an affront to public decency. Backed by John Jacob Astor and other wealthy New Yorkers, he built The Rotunda. Widely regarded as the city's first art museum, it operated on a commercial footing. The building was designed on the model of The Pantheon in Rome. It was in diameter, crowned with a dome.

He is one of only five horses to achieve this feat. His career over hurdles consisted of fifteen races, of which he won ten. He had suspect tendons throughout his career which made it difficult to keep him sound. His lack of racecourse appearances eventually earned him the nickname in some quarters of 'See You When'.https://www.independent.ie/sport/horse- racing/cheltenham/10-greatest-champion-hurdlers-30062562.html  Background  See You Then was bred in Yorkshire, England by the Ribblesdale Stud. His sire Royal Palace was a top class flat horse whose victories included the 1967 Epsom Derby. His dam Melodina, was a high class two year old in 1970. See You Then was sold for 17,000 guineas as a yearling before going into training with Con Collins in Ireland.  1983/84 Season  Prior to making his hurdling debut at Naas, in January 1984, See You Then had run eight times on the flat in Ireland, winning on four occasions. He was successful in the Naas race, then followed up with another victory in a seventeen runner race at Punchestown. He was visually impressive in this race, travelling with ease before quickening past the leaders and winning comfortably. Shortly before the Punchestown race, he had been purchased by the Stype Wood Stud Ltd, with the intention of continuing his career in Italy. He temporarily moved to Nicky Henderson's Lambourn stable in England. During this first stay with Henderson, he ran once when starting favourite for the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham, the main championship race for juvenile hurdlers. In a thirty-runner field, See You Then finished second, beaten two lengths by Northern Game after holding every chance. See You Then was then transferred to Italy where he won a hurdle race in Milan. It was then announced that he would be returning to England to continue his career with Henderson.Chasers & Hurdlers 1983/84 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1984/85 Season  See You Then won three of his five starts during this season. On his first outing in November, he finished third to Ra Nova in the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury. The following month he won the HSS Hire Shops Hurdle at Ascot. The third placed horse in that event was Desert Orchid, who re-opposed See You Then in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park. Both found the Monica Dickinson-trained Browne's Gazette too good. The winner won by fifteen lengths, with a further ten lengths separating Desert Orchid and See You Then in second and third places respectively. See You Then was then tried beyond two miles for the first time at Doncaster in February, where he won the Balmoral Hurdle. Fourteen runners lined up for the 1984 Champion Hurdle. See You Then started at 16/1. Browne's Gazette went off the 4/6 favourite ahead of the 1983 winner of the event, the Mercy Rimell-trained Gaye Brief, who started at 3/1. Ridden by Steve Smith Eccles, who was replacing the injured John Francome, See You Then travelled comfortably throughout the race, moved up to challenge at the last hurdle, then sprinted away to beat outsider Robin Wonder by seven lengths without his jockey needing to pick up his whip. Although See You Then was impressive in victory, the race is often best known for the incident at the start when Browne's Gazette swerved as the tapes went up and lost all chance of winning. He eventually finished sixth. See You Then did not reappear after Cheltenham. He ended the season with a Timeform Rating of 166p, which was 6 pounds behind the organisation's top rated hurdler of the season, Browne's Gazette.Chasers & Hurdlers 1984/85 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1985/86 season  See You Then ran only three times during this season, winning twice. He did not reappear until February, when he won the Oteley Hurdle at Sandown Park, beating the 1983 Sun Alliance Novice Hurdle winner Sabin Du Loir who was returning from a long absence .His next race was a defence of his Champion Hurdle crown. In a twenty three runner field, See You Then started the 5/6 favourite, ahead of the Martin Pipe-trained Corporal Clinger who started at 11/1. Kesslin and Gaye Brief came next in the betting. See You Then's stable companion First Bout, who had won the 1985 Triumph Hurdle, also made the line up. Missing was Browne's Gazette, who had collapsed and died in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, back in November. See You Then won easily again, beating Gaye Brief by seven lengths, with the Peter Easterby-trained Nohalmdun a further length and a half away in third. His now regular rider Steve Smith Eccles recounted, \\"The race gave me no worries at all. I managed to keep See You Then clear of the pack, cruised up behind Gaye Brief going to the last and let him sprint away up the hill with that devastating turn of foot that marks him as a true champion\\".Turf Account The Diary of a National Hunt Jockey by Steve Smith Eccles Published in 1986 Macdonald Queene Anne Press See You Then's last run was his only career appearance at Aintree. Stepping up in distance to two miles and five furlongs in the Sandeman Aintree Hurdle, he could not overhaul Aonoch and was beaten a length. The winner had previously finished well behind in the Champion Hurdle. See You Then ended the season as Timeform's top rated hurdler, with a rating of 173.Chasers & Hurdlers 1985/86 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1986/87 Season  See You Then appeared just twice, winning both races. A series of physical problems resulted in him reappearing only a week and a half before the Champion Hurdle. This came in the De Veres Hotel Hurdle at Haydock Park, where he beat his three rivals. Recounting the race, Timeform stated that, \\"since See You Then carried an unusual amount of condition for him it was reasonable to assume he would improve significantly for the outing, though he didn't blow particularly hard in the unsaddling enclosure.\\"Chasers & Hurdlers 1986/87 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd See You Then faced seventeen rivals at Cheltenham. He started favourite at 11/10, ahead of Nohalmdun, the North American champion Flatterer, and Corporal Clinger. As in the previous runnings, See You Then travelled smoothly and moved up to challenge at the last. He landed ahead and quickly opened up a gap over Barnbrook Again. However, he began to tire halfway up the run in and at the line was fully stretched to hold on by a length and a half from the Jerry Fishback-ridden Flatterer. Barnbrook Again was close behind in third. In winning the Champion Hurdle for the third successive time, See You Then joined the select band of Hatton's Grace, Sir Ken and Persian War. Istabraq would later join the list. See You Then again ended the season as Timeform's top- rated hurdler, achieving the same rating as in the previous season of 173.  1987/88 Season  Connections of See You Then had begun the season with hopes of having the first horse to win the Champion Hurdle four times. He appeared only once, when pulling up lame in the Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton. After the race it was announced that he had been retired.  1989/90 Season  See You Then's first retirement ended when he reappeared in February 1990, finishing sixth of eight runners behind Royal Derbi in the Listed City Trial Hurdle at Nottingham. He subsequently fell in the Kingwell Hurdle, before finishing 16th in the 1990 Champion Hurdle won by Kribensis. See You Then's final racecourse appearance came in the Scottish Champion Hurdle at Ayr in April 1990, where he finished ninth behind Sayparee.  Retirement  See You Then enjoyed a long retirement at his owner's premises in Italy. He died at the age of 31, in December 2011.

According to Mandjildjara tradition, their land began at several days walking distance east of Well 37 on the Canning Stock Route. According to Tindale's map, the neighbouring tribes of the Ildawongga, starting from the north and running clockwise, were the Gugadja, the Ngarti (northeast), the Pintubi on their eastern flank, the Wenamba, then the Keiadjara directly south, and the Mandjildjara due west. The AIATSIS map on the other hand does not assign any independent territory to the Ildawongga, but subsumes their land under that of the Pintubi. History of contact Word that a tribe of this name existed goes back to 1953, when a Pintubi man mentioned them as the Ilda, a statement repeated by other informants over the following years. Contact was finally made in 1964 at Jupiter Creek, and Tindale considered them to have been perhaps 'the last of the free-living aborigines of Australia to come into Western contact.', though subsequently some other groups who had never met white people were encountered, though belonging to a tribe that was already known, the Ngadadjara.

Curbelo was a member of the Mediation Commission with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador following the 1990 uprising, witnessed the surrendering of arms by Contra groups to the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and participated in the peace accord between guerrilla fighters and the government of Guatemala. She is the founder of Ser Paz, a Guayaquil-based organization to help reintegrate former gang members into society. Curbelo has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Biography Nelsa Curbelo was born on 1 November 1941 to a family of atheists in Montevideo, Uruguay. At 20 years of age, she adopted Roman Catholicism and was baptized in France in 1970. Intrigued by the Amerindian cultures of Ecuador, Cerbelo decided that same year to travel to the Andean nation to work as a missionary. In 1999, Curbelo was elected to Ashoka as a Fellow. Ser Paz Participating in the Truth and Life Commission in Ecuador, Curbelo listened to first-hand accounts from former police officers of their roles in the torture and murder of hundreds of people. While working in Guayaquil, an unmarked grave used as a dump by the government containing some 200 corpses was found. This event profoundly affected Curbelo, and she decided to focus her activist efforts on a more personal level rather than in courts. Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador with a population of three million at the time, is also the country's most dangerous, being home to over 200 gangs, of which some 60,000 disaffected youths were members. On 16 April 1999, Curbelo founded the non-profit organization Ser Paz, in English \\"Being Peace,\\" to help the city's youths and reintegrate gang members into society. Beginning in her resident barrio of Guayaquil, she established mediation workshops and small businesses to settle gang disputes and give their members employment. For the first two years of operation, Curbelo met with and heard the grievances of many Guayaquil youths. In 2006, the NGO began the \\"Barrio del Paz\\" program, which would cover 42 of the most violent and criminally active blocks in the city. Twelve small businesses, such as a print shop, salon, and furniture store, were established and staffed by mixed groups of youths from various gangs. The effect of Ser Paz was immediate and impactful; in one instance, gangs that had been enemies until Ser Paz mediated their conflict allegedly piled their weapons in the street and drove over them with a steamroller.

Rosenberg founded Happy Hen when she was 11 years old, and since then it has grown into a large animal sanctuary that has given homes to nearly 1000 animals from across California. Rosenberg also speaks on animal rights related issues, starting at 12 years old when she gave a keynote address at National Animal Rights Day (NARD) in San Francisco. At age 14, Rosenberg received national press attention following an action against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 4, 2016 in protest of the treatment of animals related to the \\"Dodger Dogs\\" sold in the stadium. As recounted in a TED talk she gave, Zoe and a few other activists ran onto the field during a baseball game with banners and were arrested on live television. Activism In 2011, Rosenberg founded Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary, its mission to rescue and rehabilitate abused and abandoned chickens and turkeys. Over the years since, Happy Hen has expanded its mission to support the rescue, rehabilitation, and long-term care of abused and abandoned farm-animals of all kinds, including cows, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and quail. In 2012, at 12 years old, Rosenberg gave her first notable speech as an activist, a keynote address at National Animal Rights Day in San Francisco. In 2016, at 14 years old, Rosenberg was arrested on national television while protesting the abusive practices of a meat supplier to Dodger Stadium. She reached the pitcher's mound with a sign before being removed. In 2017, at 15 years old, Rosenberg gave a TED talk, recounting her experience as a young animal activist. Due to its popularity, the talk has been featured on the TED.com website. In 2017, Rosenberg was honored as Youth Activist of the Year at the Animal Rights National Conference (ARNC) in Washington DC. In 2018, Rosenberg was one of four finalists nationally for PETA's 13th Annual Young Animal Activist Of The Year award. In 2018, Rosenberg was detained by police while protesting the slaughter of a pig at an on-campus slaughterhouse at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), drawing attention to the fact that animals were being routinely slaughtered at this public university. In 2018, Rosenberg was arrested for chaining herself to a gate at a slaughterhouse, bringing awareness to what she believes are the ugly aspects of food production. Her protest and arrest was live-streamed on Facebook, the video watched by over 50,000 people while it was happening and many more after the fact. In 2019, while working with DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) and actor James Cromwell, Rosenberg helped lead the rescue of 100 turkeys from the Norbest slaughterhouse in Utah, many of which were taken to Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary in California. Rosenberg (age 15), arrested for chaining herself to a slaughterhouse in 2018 Zoe Rosenberg (age 17) speaks in front of San Francisco City Hall in 2019 to demand an Animal Bill of Rights. Hundreds of activists hold signs in background. In 2019, Rosenberg received national attention for conducting a high profile protest on live television during the NCAA Football National Championship Game in Levi Stadium. The protest was aimed at animal products sold in the stadium and the inhumane conditions at supplier facilities. in 2019 Zoe Rosenberg was awarded the Paul McCartney Veg Advocate Award for her work as a young activist fighting for animal rights and founding an animal sanctuary, with special focus on her work to push Rose's Law, an Animal Bill of Rights. In 2019 Rosenberg was arrested at Amazon office headquarters in San Francisco for super-gluing her hand to the front desk, in protest of the conditions at animal facilities that supply Whole Foods. The protest was live-streamed for two hours as police worked to remove her hand, drawing attention to the conditions at the facility and promoting Rose's Law. In 2020 Zoe Rosenberg launched the \\"Meat-is-Immoral.com\\" campaign which raises money for and deploys billboards on major highways. In simple text, the billboards express that the production and consumption of meat is immoral in modern society for animals, for the climate, and for industry workers. This effort first gained national attention when cattle ranchers demanded that a billboard be taken down on highway 101 in California. In 2020 Zoe Rosenberg launched a Youth Activism Campaign against the animal agriculture practices of 4-H and FFA on behalf of animals, arguing that by teaching kids to raise animals for slaughter, these organizations are desensitizing youth to the pain and suffering of non-human sentient creatures.

Designed by Dave Edwards, it is intended for amateur construction. The aircraft plans claim it can be built out of readily sourced and inexpensive materials using common tools in 150 to 250 hours construction time. Design and development The Affordaplane is constructed of an 6061 T-6 aluminum tube fuselage and other structural components, using both square and round aluminum tube. Wings are a \\"ladder-type\\" cross-brace structure supported by struts and covered in doped fabric. Builders have the option of constructing the ribs out of aluminum tube or rigid foam. Instead of welding, structural components are attached with riveted or bolted aluminum gussets. The cockpit is exposed with a plexiglass or Lexan windshield. The controls are conventional 3-axis. When built as a Part 103 ultralight, the aircraft is intended to be powered by a 26 hp (19 kW) Rotax 277, 35 hp (26 kW) Rotax 377, or similar engine. Heavier and more powerful engines including the Rotax 503 may also be used, but will result in exceeding the FAR Part 103 254 pound (115 kg) empty weight limit, if the aircraft is otherwise built as designed. The plans recommend Rotax engines, but the Half VW, Kawasaki 340 and Kawasaki 440 have also been used. The Affordaplane has a unique single acting aileron control surface approximately the entire length of the wing. Some builders have configured these as flaperons but the plans do not include details for this modification. Variants The plans are drawn as a single- seat version.

This is often related to reserve requirement and capital requirement but focuses on the specific liquidity risk of assets that are held. These regulations were imposed to negate liquidity risks of banks that played a prominent role in financial crises. Financial banks profit from providing liquidity and maturity transformation, which is the practice by financial institutions of borrowing money on shorter timeframes than they lend money out. In other words, using shorter-term deposits to fund longer-term loans. This can lead to bank runs during which depositors demand repayment of their demandable and maturing deposits, before the borrowers are required to repay the loans.Wall, L. D. (2015). Liquidity Regulation and Financial Stability. The result could be a liquidity crisis, which refers to an acute shortage (or \\"drying up\\") of liquidity. History In response to liquidity risks, bank regulators agreed global standards to reduce banks' ability to engage in liquidity and maturity transformation, thereby reducing banks' exposure to runs. Traditionally, the response to this risk was a combination of deposit insurance and discount window access. The former assures depositors not to worry about insolvency, which presumably keeps depositors who thought they might lose their funds entirely, out of the withdrawal line. The latter assures banks have access to short-term liquidity in order to meet the demands of depositors who have an immediate need for cash. These previous regulations were mainly to guard against moral hazard that both programs could create. Over the decades, after the implementation of these regulations, relatively few liquidity problems occurred in the deposit-funded commercial banking system.Tarullo, D. K. (2014). Liquidity Regulation. Federal Reserve System =2008 financial crisis= Over time there was a vast increase in the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which were supposedly safe, short-term, and liquid, but eventually resulted in poorly underwritten subprime mortgages - a classic adverse feedback loop ensued. This led to the fall of the housing market and the financial crisis of 2008. In response to this failure of liquidity regulations, there has been recent progress in developing new measures to further reinforce the core role of liquidity regulation. In 2010, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) introduced a new liquidity regulation known as the Individual Liquidity Guidance (ILG). In 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed on a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is similar in design to the ILG but plays a role in an international playing field. The purpose of ILG is to make the banking system more resilient to liquidity shocks by requiring banks to hold a minimum quantity of high quality liquid assets (HQLA). These HQLA consist of cash, central bank reserves and government bonds to cover net outflows of liabilities under two specific stress scenarios, lasting 14 days and 3 months respectively. This way it is assumed that banks that are more heavily dependent on short-term wholesale funding, especially from foreign counterparts, would experience greater funding outflows and therefore need to hold a higher ratio of HQLA to total assets, to ensure immediate survival in stressed funding conditions.Banerjee, R. N., & Mio, H. (2014). The Effects of Liquidity Regulation on Banks, (470), 385‚Äì411. The U.S. banking agencies have worked with other regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to develop the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which is the available amount of stable funding, relative to the required amount of stable funding. It is assumed that this ratio should be at least 100% on an on-going basis. The ratio can be calculated with the following formula: frac{Available amount of stable funding}{Required amount of stable funding} ‚â• 100% In this case, the ‚Äòavailable stable funding‚Äô is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The amount of such ‚Äòstable funding required‚Äô of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution, and those of its off-balance sheet exposures.Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. (2014). Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio. Working Paper, Bank for International Settlemens, (April), 15. In short, the NSFR will require banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. Together, the LCR and NSFR are designed to mitigate the risks associated with banks' reliance on unstable funding structures and to encourage them to embrace more resilient funding models. The difference between the two is that the LCR is specifically designed to improve the short-term resilience of banks against liquidity shocks and the NSFR, on the other hand, is designed to limit the risks emanating from excessive maturity mismatches over the medium to long term ECB. (2013). Liquidity regulation and monetary policy implementation. Monthly Bulletin, (April), 73‚Äì89. Debate There is some debate on the impact of the LCR and NSFR, since they can at most constrain maturity mismatches within the banking system. The underlying economic core reasons why money suppliers want liquid funds and borrowers want longer-term loans are not changed by these regulations. It is therefore a matter of time until alternative methods of liquidity and maturity transformation will be developed that may result in the next financial crisis. Whether the outcome of these liquidity regulations is a net positive for financial stability is debatable. For further reading on the debatable effects of these liquidity regulations see;Nicol√≤, G. De. (2016). Liquidity Regulation: Rationales, Benefits and Costs. National Institute Economic Review, (235), 18‚Äì26Duijma, P., & Wiertsa, P. (2016).

In 1975, Adeyemi attained professorship at Ahmadu Bello University, a promotion that made him the first professor of architecture in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Early life and education  Born to parents from Ekiti State, Adeyemi attended four different primary schools across various states before concluding his basic education in Ekiti State. His secondary education was completed at Christ's School Ado Ekiti, the state capital in 1956. In 1963, he obtained a degree in architecture from Ahmadu Bello University. In 1965, he got his master's degree from Columbia University. This was followed by another masters in Urban planning from New York University in 1973. His PhD thesis was on Kaduna Capital Territory and Metropolitan Lagos: An Analysis of Administrative and Institutional Framework for Urban land Planning and Development and was completed in the same institution by 1974.  Career  Adeyemi is the regarded as the first professor of architecture of Nigeria, he is also reported as being the pioneer academic to attain professorship in architecture in Sub-Saharan Africa. = Academic and administrative positions = Ekundayo is a member of several professional bodies including Nigerian Institute of Architects, African Union of Architects and American Institute of Planners. Ekundayo started his lecturing career at Ahmadu Bello University in 1969, where he rose through the ranks to become the dean of faculty of environmental design in 1976. He was made a professor at the university the previous year. In 1982, Ekundayo went on sabbatical to University of sheffield as a visiting professor. In 1988, Ekundayo was appointed Deputy Vice Chancellor of Federal University of Technology Akure. Between 1999 and 2002, he was selected as Ag. Vice Chancellor of the school. In 2004, he came out of retirement to become the dean of College of Science and Technology and distinguished professor in Covenant University. = Publications = In a 2008 study titled Meaning and Relevance in Nigerian Traditional Architecture: The Dialectics of growth and Change, Adeyemi attempted to correct the misconception that Africans dwelled in \\"unstructured, isolated bush communities with little appreciation of the aesthetics in town design\\" by providing understandings on what shaped the ancient traditional architectures of buildings across the main ethnic groups in Nigeria, while providing insight and an holistic view on African buildings of old. A 2014 paper titled Characteristics of Early Ecclesiastical Architecture in Lagos State in Nigeria by Adeyemi in Journal for Cultural and Design Studies noted that the period between early 1850s till the late 1920s started a major structural era in the kind of buildings designed in Nigeria. The study analyzed the five most important Christian facilities that was built during the period, while taking into consideration their distinctive properties. The findings from the publication was that the buildings were designed with minimal inputs, ideas and comments from nationals and the mechanism employed has changed over the years from what is being used today.

Episodes Production and writing On April 14, 2017, AMC renewed the series for a 16-episode fourth season and announced that Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg would replace the departing Dave Erickson as showrunners. Production began in November 2017 in Austin, Texas. Michael E. Satrazemis, a director of photography for The Walking Dead and director of 12 episodes, joined Fear the Walking Dead as a directing-producer. In November 2017, it was reported that Lennie James who portrays Morgan Jones on The Walking Dead would crossover and join the main cast in the fourth season. The fourth season also sees the additions of several new series regulars, played by Garret Dillahunt, Jenna Elfman, and Maggie Grace. On April 21, 2018, Colman Domingo revealed that he would be directing the twelfth episode of this season. The fourth season features a redesigned title sequence with new theme music. Each episode of the season has a different title card, and tells a story which will become apparent once the season is completed. The Hollywood Reporter reflected on the new intro, calling the new season, \\"a Western with zombies, very much by design.\\" Goldberg spoke of the season's narrative structure, which features multiple timelines: The new showrunners also were inspired by Westerns; Chambliss stated, \\"It all started with the themes we set out at the beginning: isolation and community. Those themes run through a lot of classic Western stories.\\" Visually, the season is inspired by John Ford and Sergio Leone's Westerns, using Once Upon a Time in the West as a template for directors. Chambliss said, \\"it's all about having wide shots, not moving the characters, but moving the characters within the frame. When we get to the editing room, it's really about slowing down the cutting pattern, and harkening back to that style of filmmaking. It does infuse the show with a different feel than what we've seen before. It's something that we're very excited for people to see.\\" The third episode of the season features the death of Nick Clark, played by Frank Dillane. In an interview after the episode had aired, Dillane revealed he asked to leave the show prior to the fourth season. The actor explained: Release On March 15, 2018, it was announced that the season premiere and the season eight finale of The Walking Dead would be screened at AMC, Regal, and Cinemark theaters across the United States on April 15, the same day as the televised airing, for \\"Survival Sunday: The Walking Dead & Fear the Walking Dead\\". The episodes marked the first crossover between the two series. The cinema screening also included an extra half-hour of exclusive bonus content. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season has an approval rating of 80% based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 6.86/10. The site's critical consensus is, \\"Fear the Walking Dead shuffles onward confidently in its fourth season with a bevy of horrifying set-pieces and heartbreaking twists, but some viewers may be dispirited by the series' constant reshuffling of its characters.\\" TVLine reevaluated the series for its fourth season, giving it a \\"B+\\" grade. Reviewer Charlie Mason wrote, \\"it's gone from being an adequate stopgap between seasons of The Walking Dead to a show that's as good or arguably even better than the one from which it was spun off.\\" He also praised the addition of Jenna Elfman and Garret Dillahunt and that season 4 has had several genuine surprises in its storytelling. However, the decision to kill off lead character Madison Clark, portrayed by Kim Dickens, was met with intense criticism. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, television critic Maureen Ryan highlighted the character as \\"one of TV's ‚Äî and cable's ‚Äî rare mature female leads\\" and cited her \\"baffling\\" demise as an example of Hollywood's ageist practices, adding, \\"the fact that this decision comes from The Walking Dead franchise, which has come under fire for its treatment of women and people of color in the past, is even more depressing.\\" =Ratings=  References   External links  2018 American television seasons Season 4 ","title":"Fear the Walking Dead (season 4)"},{"id":"55922155","text":"Leilani Leafaitulagi Grace Tamu ( Burgoyne) is a New Zealand poet and politician.

He helped to start a business in America that caught and processed them in large numbers on a commercial basis. He believed they were a limitless resource from which oils, chemicals, fertilizers, food and leather could be obtained. He later made attempts to expand the business to Europe, Africa and Australia. Background Ehrenreich, was from Moravia and moved to America in 1914; he was described as an ex-banker, chemist and naturalist. His parents, who lived in Vienna, were Rosalie Konag and Moritz Ehrenreich. He married Margaret Elsa (Grete) Koehler (1893-1960) from Dresden, Germany, on 4 December 1916 in Manhattan and naturalized as an American citizen in 1920.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; NARA Series: Passport Applications, January 2, 1906 - March 31, 1925; Roll #: 2006; Volume #: Roll 2006 - Certificates: 183600-183975, 02 Jun 1922-03 Jun 1922National Archives and Records Administration; Washington, DC; ARC Title: Index to Petitions for Naturalizations Filed in Federal, State, and Local Courts in New York City, 1792-1906; NAI Number: 5700802; Record Group Title: Records of District Courts of the United States, 1685-2009; Record Group Number: RG 21 He was financially independent and well connected. In 1917, with fellow investors, he launched the Ocean Leather Company for the purpose of tanning and refining shark hides. Reports at the time of the registration indicated that the company was capitalised at $41 million. Ehrenreich was the company president, and Dr Russell J. Coles (1865-1928) - who was a knowledgeable deep sea fisherman and fishing buddy of Theodore Roosevelt - was a director and honorary president. Dermal denticles Placoid scales as viewed through an electron microscope. Also called dermal denticles, these are structurally homologous with vertebrate teeth. Shark skin is covered with placoid scales, or dermal denticles; leather made with these scales still attached is referred to as Shagreen. However, Ehrenreich had to find a way to remove these scales from the hides in order for his product to reach a wider market. Initially he tried a process patented by a Danish chemist called Kristian Bendixon. Later the company switched to a system that involved the hides being treated by acid. Two chemists came up with similar ideas, Theodore H. Kohler and Dr Allen Rogers. Once treated in this way the skin could be split into layers, to both increase the yield and obtain the required thickness of leather. The appearance of the resulting hide was similar to that from cattle, but much tougher and less prone to scuffing. By-products In addition to a tannery at Tyler Street, Newark, New Jersey, the Ocean Leather Company had reclaiming plants in Morehead City, and Cape Lookout, North Carolina plus Fort Myers and Sanibel Island, Florida. These plants handled sharks, rays, porpoises, turtles and other large sea animals that were landed by its fleet of fishing vessels. The sharks were caught in large mesh nets that trapped the animals. There were other methods used including hooking and underwater explosives, however, it was important not to damage the hide as this reduced its value. There were about twenty other processes to extract by-products from the carcasses including glue, dies, medicine, enzymes, fertilizer, animal feed, oil (from the liver) and the fins that were sold to the Chinese market. The meat could also be dried or smoked and sold as food for human consumption. Several of the patents for these processes were taken out by Ehrenreich.Castro, Jose I.

In 1923, whilst still in Europe, he applied for a years extension to their passports, informing the American consulate in Vienna that they intended to visit France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy and the British Isles. At this same time Ehrenreich was obtaining patents in Europe in anticipation of moving production outside America.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; NARA Series: Passport Applications, January 2, 1906 - March 31, 1925; Roll #: 2209; Volume #: Roll 2209 - Certificates: 261850-262349, 30 Mar 1923-02 Apr 1923 His third child, daughter Ruth, was born in Vienna on 29 April 1923.National Archives and Records Administration; Washington, D.C.; Decimal Files, compiled 1910 - 1949; Record Group: 59, General Records of the Department of State, 1763 - 2002; Series ARC ID: 2555709; Series MLR Number: A1 3001; Series Box Number: 373; File Number: 131 On the 11 April 1924 in Paris, Ehrenreich was granted a further twelve months extension to his American passport for ‚ÄúCommercial Business‚Äù reasons.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; NARA Series: Applications for Extension and Amendment of Passports; Volume #: Box 24: Passport Numbers 390148 - 395002 Ehrenreich employed fishermen with the expert knowledge for shark hunting and one such was Captain William E. Young (1875-1962) who acted as an operations manager. In about 1923 he joined Ehrenreich‚Äôs team in Paris and put together an expedition to Djibouti, in French Somaliland, where he helped set up a station for catching and processing sharks. Next he travelled to Australia in 1926 with small team led by Ehrenreich. By this time Young was having doubts about Ehrenreich and his conviction regarding shark migration numbers and routes. They discussed their differing views and eventually agreed to part company. Young remained in Australia for a period but eventually returned to Honolulu where he set up a business with his brothers. Ehrenreich travelled to New Zealand to assess the possibility of setting up a shark fishing and processing station there. Nothing came of this so in 1927 he set up a pilot scheme in Carnarvon, Western Australia, leasing a disused meat processing factory from the authorities and calling the operation Marine Products (Australia). At about this same time he and his brother were having a factory ship prepared in Antwerp, Belgium. Factory ship Nahma/Istar 1926 Lloyd's yacht register Istar The ship chosen for conversion was Istar, a 300 ft luxury yacht, built in 1897 for New York property millionaire Robert Goelet, and originally named Nahma. After Goelet‚Äôs death the yacht stayed in family hands, but in WWI it was used by the US Navy. During the prohibition years in America it became a rum-runner, after which Prince and Princess Andrew of Russia proposed to take it on a world cruise with paying guests. However, this failed to materialise and the vessel came into the ownership of two Englishmen, ex-Royal Naval Commander Charles Lester Kerr and ex-army Major Robin Thynne, both of whom became directors of Marine Products. They sold the yacht to the company in exchange for 250,000 ordinary shares. Ehrenreich sold his British and Colonial patent rights to the company using this same arrangement. Ehrenreich and Thynne were joint managing directors and Kerr the overseas director. He was with Ehrenreich in New Zealand and Australia in 1927 when the two had a disagreement. Kerr returned to England where he found it necessary to sue (unsuccessfully) for loss of earnings. The Istar's conversion to a factory ship was managed by Rudolf Hauschka, who had been with Ehrenreich during the shark fishing pilot scheme in Carnarvon. Care was taken with the design so as not to upset the ship‚Äôs stability: tanning drums, tanks, and incinerators were erected on the quarterdeck; the oil extraction and drying plant for fins and meat was amidships; the main deck was reserved for the handling of the catch and ten motor boats used for catching the sharks were also accommodated. The Istar could process thirty tons of sharks a per-day with sufficient storage for a hundred days work. Due to inadequate funding, and resistance from some sectors of the leather trade, Hauschka advised Ehrenreich to abandon his plans. Istar was laid up in the East India Docks, London, for about a year while the company tried to negotiate a solution. Ehrenreich and Hauschka visited Corsica where they were offered land based facilities. The eventual outcome was that Istar was leased to a French syndicate for ¬£200 per month plus a percentage of the profits, and the ship left London for Madagascar in 1929. In about June or July of that year, during bad weather conditions, Istar ran aground and remained so for two to three weeks. The ship was refloated and was taken to Durban, South Africa in a poor condition. The ship had been insured and efforts were made to restart the business in Durban but this failed, leading to bankruptcy proceeding against Marine Products in London. Istar was sold for scrap and scuttled off the coast of Durban on 28 March 1931. Rudolf Hauschka had left Ehrenreich to work with Dr. Ita Wegman in her clinic in Switzerland. She was a friend of Hauschka and visited him on the Istar when she attended the Anthroposophical World Conference in London 1928. Ehrenreich‚Äôs fellow director, Major Robin Thynne, became a patient of Dr Wegman before his death in 1936 and it is possible that Ehrenreich also sought treatment in her clinic. Final years Ehrenreich and his family had moved to London and lived in a house in Willow Road, overlooking Hampstead Heath.Principal Probate Registry 1931.

In 2011, she participated in Initiales S.G., a tribute to Serge Gainsbourg at the Francofolies de Montr√©al and had a sold-out show at the Montreal Jazz Festival. She also took part in Lady & Bird's opera, Red Waters. Furey has danced for choreographers Claude Godin, Georges Stamos, and Danielle Desnoyers. In 2013, she danced with Damien Jalet at the Mus√©e du Louvre. In 2015, Furey and Peter Jasko staged Untied Tales (The Vanished Power of the Usual Reign). Quebec Danse described it as a provocative piece with an invisible danger urging the two performers to escape their environment. At the end of 2016, after several collaborations, Furey became an associate artist of Par B.L.eux. The organization provided administrative and logistical support, and helped her restage Untied Tales. In 2017 Furey staged her first group work, Cosmic Love, in collaboration with her brother, composer Tomas Furey, featuring four performers in a choreographed piece with light and sound media in a striped-down performance space. Furey took part in the MACM's Leonard Cohen exhibition with a 90-minute silent dance piece as a meditation of passing time. =Personal life= Furey is the daughter of Lewis Furey and Carole Laure.

In 1867, he was shot dead in an ambush on the locked police carriage transporting the Fenians Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy; he was the first police officer from Manchester to be killed on duty. History Brett was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, to Mary and William Brett, who both worked in the clothing industry. Brett followed them into the industry, and at the time of the 1841 Census was working as a weaver. In 1830, he had married a woman named Mary. They had four children: William, Mary, Charles and Elizabeth. The Manchester City Police force came into existence after the passing of the County Police Act, 1839. With his family, he moved from Macclesfield to Manchester about 1847 and his police career began then; his youngest daughter was born in Manchester in 1850. In 1861, he was living at 7 Wilson Street. At the time of his death, Brett had had a lot of experience accompanying prisoners to gaol in secure transports. Thomas Kelly, the new leader of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (I.R.B.), had been arrested in Manchester with Timothy Deasy under the Vagrancy Act in the small hours of 11 September 1867. Suspected of being robbers, they were found to be armed and information was later passed from Dublin which established their identity. A magistrate directed that they be remanded in custody. An escape plan was arranged by Ricard O'Sullivan Burke, an Irish veteran of the American Civil War. On 18 September, Brett was with a horse-drawn police van; he was one of a dozen police officers transferring prisoners from Court to Belle Vue Gaol in Manchester. Kelly and Deasy were in locked compartments separated from the other prisoners. A group of Fenians armed with an assortment of firearms and cudgels surrounded the carriage at the bridge over Hyde Road near the gaol. One - James Cahill - shot a horse dead in order to stop the carriage. The officers were overwhelmed: one was reported wounded by a bullet, as was a passer-by. Attempts by the attackers to lever open the door failed. They called to Brett inside the van, demanding the keys. The words of reply, \\"I dare not. I must do my duty,\\" were later attributed to Brett (and were inscribed on his gravestone). Peter Rice, another of the ambush group, fired through the keyhole of the lock; this was in order to break it, according to a police witness, Constable Shaw. The bullet passed through Brett's eye into his skull, killing him. Rice still couldn't open the door. The keys were then handed out through the window of the carriage by one of the prisoners inside. Kelly and Deasy were released. Alternative contemporary journalistic reports describe Fenians trying to gain entry through the roof of the van by smashing at the wood with a rock that had been passed up, with Brett then confronted by William Allen (later executed) who shot him above the eye, the bullet exiting the top of his skull. In other witness testimony in court, a frustrated Allen fired through the roof ventilator, a prisoner shouted \\"He's killed!\\", the keys were passed out and Brett fell out dead once the door was opened; a further witness claimed Brett was not yet dead, despite his mortal wound. Newspapers heavily criticised the authorities for ordering the movement of the prisoners unnecessarily with unarmed policemen when they had been warned of an ambush. In the ensuing police crackdown, many people, mostly Irish, were targeted for arrest. A ¬£300 reward (approximately ¬£25,000 in 2019) for information aiding the recapture of Kelly and Deasy went unclaimed. Various terms of imprisonment were handed down. Five people were sentenced to death but three, William Allen, Michael Larkin and Michael O‚ÄôBrien, were executed - the last people in Manchester to be - and became known as the Manchester Martyrs amongst Irish nationalists; they had taken part in the ambush but Rice - the shooter (in Court, Allen was accused of firing the fatal shot) - Kelly and Deasy all escaped to live in the U.S.A. Burke - the organiser - was later arrested on a separate issue and spent four years of a fifteen-year sentence in gaol. Despite the initial outrage and some clear prejudice, the process and result of the trials was reported as unsatisfactory to an impartial observer. Legacy Brett's funeral was very prominent, attended by the mayor, councillors, aldermen, firemen and about 400 police officers from different divisions; the cort√®ge was a third of a mile long, containing over thirty carriages and ran for two miles, witnessed by thousands. The Manchester General Cemetery in Harpurhey was so full it had to be closed so that the family and deceased would be able to access the grave. Brett was survived by his father, wife and children. Mary Brett was awarded 21 shillings weekly for life and the Brett's children ¬£300 upon her death. The Manchester Police and other contributors commissioned a separate wall-mounted marble memorial to Brett inside St. Barnabas' Church, Ancoats, where Brett worshipped. It was moved to St. Ann's Church, Manchester upon the closure of St. Barnabas' in 1959.

Seong is also known for his research on the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi and his research on immunological adjuvant when he was a student. Since 2013 he has served as Director of the Wide River Institute of Immunology ‚Äì Seoul National University in conjunction with his Professor position in the Microbiology and Immunology department of Seoul National University College of Medicine. In 2012, he became Editor in Chief of the World Journal of Immunology.  Career  Seong earned his medical degree (M.D.) in 1990, from Seoul National University College of Medicine. After receiving his M.D., Seong continued his education at Seoul National University College of Medicine and was awarded Doctor of Philosophy in both Immunology and Microbiology in 1995. From 1995-1998 he worked as a Doctor for Public Health in the Biomedical Research division of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. While working at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seong's research focused on immunologic study of mucosal membranes and developing a vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of both pneumonia and meningitis. In 1998, he became an Assistant professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine in the Microbiology department and in 2010, became a full professor. From 2001 to 2004, Seong worked in the National Institute of Health Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology as a Research Fellow. In 2012, he became the Associate Dean for Planning of Seoul National University College of Medicine and since his appointment in 2013 he has served as the Director of Wide River Institute of Immunology. Currently, Seong serves as Associate Dean for Graduate Study and Professor of Seoul National University College of Medicine, as well as Editor in Chief of World Journal of Immunology. Additionally, since 2008 he has acted as Director of R&D; Promotion for the Department of Disease Research ‚Äì Korea Health Industry Development institute. Seong is a member of the Korean Society for Microbiology, Korean Society for Immunology, American Society for Microbiology, and American Society for Immunology. He currently acts as President of the Korean Society for Dendritic Cells and Secretary of the International DAMPs Association.The International DAMPs Association is a society of researchers from varying disciplines whose goal is to investigate the numerous roles of Damage associated molecular patterns in disease, injury and infection. Seong's primary research interest is the interaction of DAMPs, Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and hyppos (hydrophobic portions exposed on the surface of denatured molecule or molecular aggregates) in immune response initiation. His lab also studies dendritic cells, cancer immunotherapy and single domain antibody therapies. His current research is centered on the DAMPs Model of immune response initiation, and investigating novel hyppo centered treatments for inflammatory diseases. Outside of the DAMPs innate immune response model, Seong's lab is working on developing dendritic cell based cancer vaccines and the development of recombinant camel antibodies specific to tumor antigens for therapeutic use.  Damage Associated Molecular Pattern model research  The major focus of Seong's lab is to obtain a more thorough understanding of the DAMPs model of immunity and the potential impact this model may have in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The DAMPs model was suggested by Seong in 2004 and combines elements of the Self-Non-Self and Danger Model to explain innate immune response. The DAMPs model involves the immune-stimulatory ability of exposed hydrophobic portions of denatured molecules (hyppos, water-insoluble molecules) from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Seong proposes that PAMPs, and alarmin originated from a common DAMPs ancestral subfamily and were modified by the innate immune system to stimulate immune response in addition to cell damage repair. In addition, the DAMPs model suggests that the early immune system evolved from an ancient damage response initiation pathway directed by the presence of hyppos. From the similarities between PAMPs, alarmins, and DAMPs as well as the evolutionary relationship between immune response systems and damage repair response systems, Seong proposed the presence of a universal mechanism of cellular response to injury and instigation of repair. In his study of hyppos and the DAMPs model Seong discovered molecules termed \\"hyppo- quenchers\\" which prevent initiation of immune responses by hyppos when the cell is not in normal physiological conditions. Hyppo-quenchers prevent immune response by inhibiting interaction between hyppos and their receptors. In studying nuclear factor-Œ∫B dependent gene expression Seong found strong evidence that apolipoproteins function as a hyppo-quencher. When exposed to high hyppo levels, cells with apolipoproteins did not initiate immune responses evidencing their role as a hyppo-quencher. Seong has continued his study of the DAMPs Model with his research on the role of DAMPs and hyppos in several inflammatory diseases. In particular, his lab studies the role of hyppos in Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis. In pathological conditions and cases of cell damage the concentration of exposed hyppos in tissue microenvironment is too great to be resolved by activity of quenchers. When exposed to aqueous conditions hyppos incorrectly aggregate with one another through hydrophobic interactions resulting in potentially toxic proteins and activation of innate immune response resulting in inflammation. Thus, constantly elevated hyppo levels can lead to chronic inflammation. The goal of his study into diseases potentially caused by hyppos is to examine the therapeutic potential of hyppo-quenchers for treatment of inflammatory diseases based on his hypothesis that hyppo- quenchers might have evolved as an immune modulator. Recently, he is carrying out phase I clinical trial for Atopic dermatitis using small molecule that quenches hyppo at micromolar concentration and regulate inflammation at nanomolar concentration by interacting with GPCR19.

Life Higginson was born in Plaistow in London in 1881 to Alfred Leopold and Elizabeth (born Vernon) Ellis. Her father was a seaman who reputedly liked to drink too much. The family moved to Manchester and then on to Preston where she was a teacher. Higginson married in 1905 and had five children. She opened a health food shop in 1910 which she ran for ten years. Higginson was a well known Labour Party member so like a lot of female members she was approached by Edith Rigby to become a suffragette. Edith lead the Preston branch of the Women's Social and Political Union. Higginson attended meetings but did not initially want to get involved. However, by 1913 Edith Rigby was in hiding and the Preston branch was run by Higginson and Elizabeth Ellen (Beth) Hesmondhalgh. Higginson took over from Hesmondhalgh as honorary secretary in April 1914. The following month on the 21 May Higginson was in London trying with others to present their case to the King. The King refused to see them and the suffragettes were manhandled by the police. A notable photograph was taken of Higginson resisting arrest. She was not arrested at this point but she ended up being armed with stones to protest at the King's refusal to see them. The stones had been delivered in two suitcases that had been filled in Southend-on-Sea. Many chose notable buildings but Higginson chose a pub because she remembered how drink had dominated her father's life. 67 people were arrested which included two men. Higginson was erroneously charged with breaking windows in Parliament Street and sentenced to four months in prison. Higginson refused food in protest at not being treated as a political prisoner. She was temporarily released under the Cat and Mouse Act and then rearrested. The idea was to prevent suffragettes from having to be force-fed. She served a few more days in jail before she was again temporarily released. Her re arrest was prevented by a general amnesty declared by the government at the start of the war. The WSPU had agreed to a truce and in return all prisoners were released. During the war Edith Rigby and Higginson made jam. Higginson's husband died in 1938 and Higginson spent the end of her life in Bognor Regis living with her former WSPU colleague Elizabeth Hesmondhalgh.

Name Arthur Capell took the term Ngardi to refer, not to a distinct tribe, but to a branch of the Warlpiri, a point contested by Norman Tindale, who maintained they were distinct. Country In Norman Tindale's calculations, the Ngarti's tribal territory stretched over approximately , covering the sandhill country west of the Tanami track, extending from Chilla Well, the Granites, and Gardiner Range over the border into Western Australia at Ima Ima. They were present at Sturt Creek, and the Pallottine Mission area at Balgo Hill. Their southern extension, he adds, went as far as across the mulga scrubland to Milidjipi and Tekkari north of Lake Mackay. =Joint land claim= On 21 August 1980 a land claim was submitted by 90 claimants on behalf of the Warlpiri, Kukatja and Ngarti peoples, as traditional owners, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, for an area of about .

The land borders on areas in which each of the languages ‚Äì Ngarti, Warlpiri, and Kukatja ‚Äì is dominant.

It was originally built in 1948 as a warehouse and recreational facility for the British Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI). It was the head office of Sea Malta from 1981 to 2006, and it has been abandoned since then. Part of the building was demolished in November 2017 after it was found that its foundations were in a poor state. History =Background= The NAAFI (Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes) was present in Malta since 1919 and its introduction set a competitive impact to Maltese businessmen. A good number of Maltese workers benefitted as they were employed with the NAAFI. The NAAFI had initially occupied two stores at the Barriera Wharf (no. 13 and 14) outside the fortifications of Valletta (which stores were built by Grand Master Perellos for Maritime commerce) setting a business of an automobile garage. After almost three decades, the NAAFI moved out and the stores became occupied by a wine business set up by the A.M. & A. Cassar Brothers. =Purposely built building= The Sea Malta Building was originally built in 1949 for the NAAFI, and was initially known as the NAAFI Building. It was designed by the architecture firm Mortimer and de Giorgio Architects. The building served as a warehouse, but it also housed shops, restaurants and other recreational facilities. The building had a significant role in WWII when it served food to many people around the Grand Harbour area. The British Navy left Malta in March 1979 (Freedom) and hence the NAAFI vacated the building. The building remained adequate for sea-related activity and thus was established to be used as a warehouse for ships. In April 1981, the building was converted into the head office of Sea Malta Company Limited, formerly the Sea Malta Groupage Bonds, who moved there from their previous offices in Floriana. It remained the company's headquarters until the company dissolved in 2006. Parts of the building were later used as a warehouse, while the rest of the block were abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair. =Partial demolition= The Sea Malta Building (white building on the left) as seen from Bridge Wharf in 2014. The sea-facing section visible in this photo was demolished in 2017. In 2017, it was found that part of the building's foundations were in a poor state as they were constructed on metal piles resting on the seabed, which were prone to erosion. The quay on which the building was constructed had already partially collapsed. A structural appraisal report stated that the building became an operational risk for the Grand Harbour. The Planning Authority approved the demolition of a large part of the building. The Chamber of Architects and the NGOs Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa and Flimkien gƒßal Ambjent Aƒßjar asked the Authority to nullify the permit awarded for the demolition, with the Chamber stating that the structural appraisal report did not identify the structure as in imminent danger of collapse. The rear part of the building began to be demolished on 20 November 2017 by Enemalta contractors. The front end of the building, including the clock tower, is not in danger of collapse and will not be demolished. Architecture The Sea Malta Building has been called \\"a fine modernist building\\". It includes a distinctive clock tower. The Planning Authority has mixed opinion about the building and hence sought for the conservation of the main features.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. At the time of its nomination it contained 39 resources, which included seven contributing buildings, nine contributing sites, eight contributing structures, four contributing objects, four non-contributing buildings, two non-contributing sites, three non-contributing structures, and two non-contributing objects. The park was a gift from F.L. Maytag, founder of the Maytag Company, to the people of Newton. It is significant as an example of a privately funded public park during the Great Depression. The partial of land was acquired by Maytag in 1935. It had previously served as the fairgrounds owned by the Jasper County Agricultural Society. He made an agreement with the city council that the park would be privately owned and operated, but open for public use. The city was required to provide water and electricity. It remained a privately owned park until 1977 when it was conveyed to the city. The park was laid out by the Chicago landscape design firm of Simonds, West, and Blair. Chicago architect and Newton native, John Reed Fugard, designed the swimming pool (1935), bathhouse (1935), amphitheater (1936), the Superintendent's residence and office (1936). Buildings that pre- date the establishment of the park include a pioneer log cabin (1848) and the livestock workshed (c. 1920). Both were part of the fairgrounds, and the log cabin is believed to be the last structure of its kind extant in Jasper County. Other historic elements include the north entry structures (1935), the roadway (1935), the flagpole area (1935), an incinerator (c. 1935), two stone privies (c. 1935), three stone fireplaces (1935), four concrete boundary pillars (1935, 1936), two parking areas (north, 1935; west 1936), the ice skating rink (1936), the north softball field (1936), the tennis courts (1936), children's playground (1936), and the west shelter house (1940) References Newton, Iowa Protected areas of Jasper County, Iowa National Register of Historic Places in Jasper County, Iowa Historic districts in Jasper County, Iowa Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Rustic architecture in Iowa Modernist architecture in Iowa ","title":"Fred Maytag Park"},{"id":"55922662","text":"Israeli Wrestling League (IWL) (; , Rabitat al-musaraeat al-israyiylia), is an Israeli professional wrestling promotion founded in 2013 by Eitan Levy & Lidor Bushary.
