On 26 July 2016, Hamel was murdered during the 2016 Normandy church attack by two Muslim men pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant while he celebrated Mass in his church. The circumstances of his death have led him to be called a martyr by Christians, including Pope Francis, non-Christians, and the press. Calls to make him a saint started soon after his death. The canonization cause was officially opened at diocesan level in April 2017, after Pope Francis had waived the otherwise mandatory five-year waiting period for the opening of such causes. Early life Hamel was born on 30 November 1930 in Darn√©tal, France. At the age of six he became a choirboy in St. Paul's Church in Rouen and at 14 he entered the minor seminary. He served in the military for 18 months in Algeria. He did not wish to be an officer as he did not want to issue orders to other men to kill. Ministry Hamel was ordained as a priest on 30 June 1958. He served as a vicar at the St. Antoine church in Le Petit- Quevilly from 1958, a vicar at the Notre-Dame de Lourdes church in Sotteville- l√®s-Rouen from 1967, a parish priest in Saint-Pierre-l√®s-Elbeuf from 1975, and a parish priest in Cl√©on from 1988. He joined the church in Saint-√âtienne-du- Rouvray in 2000. He officially retired at the age of 75, but was allowed to keep serving in the parish. As a result, he assumed his role as the parish's assistant priest from 2005 to his death. With local imam Mohammed Karabila, the president of Normandy's regional council of Muslims, Hamel worked since early 2015 on an interfaith committee. After Hamel's death, Karabila described him as his friend with whom he had discussed religion and as also someone who gave his life for others. Death and legacy Hamel died when his throat was slit by two Muslim men, Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, who both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The attack occurred while Hamel was saying Mass in his parish in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray on 26 July 2016. During the attack, Hamel said \\"Satan, go!\\" when confronted by his killers. Commemorations and funeral A Mass was held in his memory at Notre Dame de Paris on 27 July 2016. It was celebrated by the archbishop of Paris, Andr√© Vingt-Trois, and attended by president Fran√ßois Hollande, prime minister Manuel Valls and ministers Jean-Marc Ayrault, Bernard Cazeneuve, Emmanuel Macron and Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, as well as former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, the archbishop of Rouen, Dominique Lebrun, and the apostolic nuncio to France, Luigi Ventura. Hamel's grave at Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours cemetery The Funeral Mass was held at Rouen Cathedral on 2 August 2016, drawing a crowd of thousands and a large number of luminaries including senior clerics, the French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve and former prime minister Laurent Fabius. Pope Francis instructed Lebrun to place images of Hamel in all the local churches. In August 2016, the Italian arm of Aid to the Church in Need announced it would cover the cost of training 1,000 new priests in countries like Nigeria, Cuba, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and India in response to Hamel's murder. Likewise, in August 2016, in memory of Father Hamel, Br. Alexis Bugnolo founded the Ordo Militaris Catholicus, \\"international defense and security initiative of Catholics for Catholics who are suffering persecution for their faith, where their defense and liberation requires military intervention or security actions, and this is allowed by local and/or international law..\\" His legacy was also celebrated by French singer-songwriter Vianney Bureau in his song 'L' homme et l'√¢me ' which was dedicated to P√®re Hamel as well as victims of terror attacks throughout France. Canonization cause On the same day of the murder, public figures like the president of Lombardy, Roberto Maroni, called on Pope Francis to \\"immediately proclaim him St Jacques\\". The hashtag #santosubito (\\"saint now\\") trended on Twitter. Hamel was called a martyr by some international press shortly after his death. On 13 August, La Croix reported that archbishop Dominique Lebrun of Rouen said he thought Hamel was a martyr, but the decision to declare him so was the pope's. He added that \\"formally, it is the bishop of the person's place of death to initiate the procedure.\\" Anthony Fisher, the archbishop of Sydney, suggested he died in odium fidei (\\"in hatred of the faith\\"), adding, \\"This is a term Catholics use to describe the characteristic death of a martyr, as one who dies for his or her faith, and because of that faith.\\" Pope Francis celebrates a special Mass for Hamel on 14 September 2016 On 14 September 2016, Pope Francis referred to Hamel as \\"blessed\\", a title used prior to canonisation. \\"This man accepted his martyrdom next to the martyrdom of Christ, on the altar,\\" Pope Francis said on 14 September during a homily at a Mass held for Hamel's soul at the Vatican. \\"He is a martyr and martyrs are beatified,\\" the pope continued.. Two weeks later Archbishop Lebrun announced in a homily that the Pope had formally waived the five-year waiting period needed before the start of a canonization process, and that he had decided to prepare it without delay. During Chrism Mass (on Holy Thursday, 13 April 2017), Archbishop Lebrun publicly announced the opening of the Canonization cause, with all of Rouen's clergy gathered. Archbishop Lebrun also said the Pope himself allowed a photo of Fr. Jacques to be put in a church, and called him blessed. Fr Paul Vigouroux, vice-chancellor of the diocese of Rouen, has been appointed postulator of the Cause, in charge of the local investigation. The Archdiocese of Rouen distributed a prayer to request Father Jacques's intercession. The prayer makes reference to the circumstances of his murder, including his unmasking of Satan, the divisor and his death in the habits of prayer. Archbishop Lebrun announced on 1 February 2019 that the diocesan inquiry for the beatification process would be solemnly closed on 9 March 2019.

It was located where a parking lot two blocks away from the Toyota Center is currently. Liberty Hall was owned and operated by Mike Condray, Lynda Herrera, Ryan Trimble, Ken Fontenot, and Roberto Gonzales. It hosted a wide variety of performers, including Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top, and Journey. It is remembered for its low admittance prices of sometimes only two dollars for nationally known entertainers. History Before Liberty Hall, Condray and George Banks, the future graphic illustrator of Liberty Hall posters, opened Jubilee Hall which became the Family Hand, a restaurant and entertainment venue. The restaurant was known for its red beans and rice, prepared by Thera Neumann, the African-American female chef. When Condray began looking for a new location to open with Herrera and Trimble, Neumann found the building that would become Liberty Hall. The building was originally a church built in the 1940s and later became the American Legion Post 391. On March 4, 1971, it opened as Liberty Hall. Co-founder Herrera came up with the name. Neumann moved with the owners to Liberty Hall and continued to cook for the performances. The nightclub hosted musicians from the country, rock, zydeco, and blues genre. On Liberty Hall's opening night, the venue hosted the country rock musical Earl of Ruston. Soon after Earl of Ruston, Liberty Hall had a six-week-long blues show with musicians like Big Mama Thornton, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Freddie King. Hopkins became close friends with Trimble and performed multiple times at Liberty Hall by himself and with Mance Lipscomb. The venue began to gain prominence in Houston. Springsteen mentions Liberty Hall in his song This Hard Land. KPFT and Liberty Hall worked together to produce live broadcasts of performers like Springsteen, Ramones, and Gram Parsons. Besides the many musicians that performed at Liberty Hall, the venue hosted plays and comedy performances. Cheech and Chong performed for a completely sold out four-night stand for two dollars a ticket. Cheech and Chong credit Liberty Hall for their success. Liberty Hall also hosted rock opera director C. C. Courtney's play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest from March 23 to April 22, 1972. At the time, it was the longest running play in the history of Houston. Courtney made a deal with Liberty Hall to continue directing his rock operas at the venue. His other work performed at Liberty Hall in 1972 was Ripped and Wrinkled. Liberty Hall did not extend only to music and entertainment performances. The venue held benefits for progressive candidates. On September 17, 1972, Liberty Hall hosted a rally for the \\"candidates of the people.\\" The rally had a performance by the hard rock band Chocolate Glass. Many candidates attended and spoke at the event including Sissy Farenthold, Gertrude Barnstone, and Curtis Graves. Marvin Zindler, Deputy Sheriff at the time, also attended the event. Red beans and rice were sold for one dollar as a fundraiser. On September 20, 1972, Liberty hall hosted a beans and rice dinner benefit for George McGovern and his presidential campaign. In February 1973, Liberty Hall hosted the first annual convention of the National Women's Political Caucus with female leaders Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug, and Betty Friedan. The convention had performances by Tracy Nelson and her band Mother Earth along with a New Orleans band called Flavor. In 1975, Condray left Liberty Hall. Trimble believes Liberty Hall put on 300 to 400 shows a year until it closed in 1978 with a performance by Muddy Waters. The building that was once Liberty Hall became a Chinese film theater. Eventually, the building was demolished. Today, a parking lot near the Toyota Center sits where Liberty Hall once was. Design The venue was relatively small, holding about 450 people. The stage and floors were wooden. The intimate setting allowed for good acoustics, different from popular arena- style venues at the time. Banks constructed the stage and balcony.

Established only four years after the nearby Scuola Grande Tedesca (1528), it is the second oldest Venetian synagogue. Its origins are uncertain: it might have been constructed as a prayer room for a group of Proven√ßal Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, or as a private synagogue for a prominent local family. Repeatedly remodeled throughout its history, its interior is predominantly decorated in the Baroque and Rococo styles. The synagogue was most recently restored in 2016-2017 by the World Monuments Fund. It is open to the public through the Jewish Museum of Venice. Name Like the other four synagogues in Venice, the Canton Synagogue was termed a scuola (\\"School\\") rather than sinagoga (\\"Synagogue\\"), in the same way in which Ashkenazi Jews refer to the synagogue as the shul () in Yiddish. In the Venetian context, however, the term has a further connotation: Scuola was in fact the name given to Christian confraternity institutions devoted to assisting those in need, the most famous being the six Scuole Grandi of Venice. The building of the Canton Synagogue hosted indeed the headquarters of several charitable and aid organizations throughout the centuries, similarly to what happened in the adjacent Scuola Italiana. Among the several proposed etymologies for the word Canton, the generally accepted one links it to the site's ancient toponym, canton del medras (midrash's corner), referring to the building's position in the southern corner of the square of the Ghetto Nuovo. According to another hypothesis, the word derives from the Canton (or Cantoni) family which allegedly financed the synagogue's construction;Canton Synagogue. jvenice.org. Retrieved July 14, 2016. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that three Jewish prayer rooms once located in the Ghetto Nuovo (Scuola Luzzatto, Scuola Coanim and Scuola Meshullamim) bore the names of their founding families. History The two wooden columns placed on the left-hand side of the bimah. On the lower left corner is the inscription recording the gift of 180 ducats in 1532 for the synagogue's construction The Canton Synagogue is one of the three synagogues located in the Ghetto Nuovo (the oldest part of the Venetian Ghetto, established on 29 March 1516), together with the Scuola Grande Tedesca and Scuola Italiana. It was built between 1531 and 1532The synagogues. Jewish Museum of Venice. Retrieved July 14, 2016. by members of the local Ashkenazi community. A stone plaque placed to the left of the bimah records the gift of 180 ducats, donated by a man named Shlomo in 1532 for the synagogue's construction. The same date (5292 according to the Hebrew calendar) is displayed over the entrance door. The establishment of the Canton Synagogue followed by four years that of the nearby Scuola Grande Tedesca, also of Ashkenazi rite, and may have thus been the result of an emerging division within the local Ashkenazi community. Evidence suggests that the new synagogue might have been in fact erected by a group of Proven√ßal Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, in a period marked by a sharp increase in the Jewish population of Venice due to immigration from nearby countries. Proven√ßal Jews were forced to leave en masse Arles following the annexation of Provence to France (1484), with many of them opting to settle in Italy. Several elements seem to prove the Proven√ßal origins of the Canton Synagogue: for instance, it was the only Venetian synagogue where the Lekhah Dodi‚Äîa hymn commonly intoned by French Jews on the eve of Sabbath‚Äîwas sung. Moreover, the synagogue's \\"bifocal effect\\" (created by the bimah and the ark facing each other at the opposite ends of the sanctuary), an arrangement rarely seen in old European synagogues, is a common feature of Proven√ßal synagogue buildings, such as those of Carpentras and Cavaillon. The synagogue building originally hosted both religious and social functions: the ground floor was occupied by the coffin warehouse of the Fraterna della Misericordia degli Hebrei Tedeschi, a Jewish institution which provided burial services for members of the community (replaced in the nineteenth century by the Fraterna dei Poveri), while the second floor housed the local Talmud Torah school (Fraterna sive Scuola Talmud Torah di Ghetto Nuovo). The Canton synagogue was remodeled multiple times throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, with the most important interventions taking place in the late 1630s and 1650s, 1730s, and 1770s. Along with the other synagogues of Venice, it ceased to be regularly used in October 1917, when the local Jewish community was forced to disband; at the same time, administration of all the Jewish places of worship was taken over by a single institution, the Templi Israelitici Uniti. Starting in 1968, the building underwent major restoration interventions operated by the World Monuments Fund and the Italian Ministry for Cultural Assets and Environments, which included stabilization of the foundations and wall insulation. In 1989 the synagogue was finally reopened to the public, as part of a new museum area combining together all three synagogues of the Ghetto Nuovo, as well as the Venice Museum of Jewish Art (established in 1953, now the Jewish Museum of Venice). More recent conservation campaigns were carried out by the WMF in 2014 and in 2016-2017, with support from the David Berg Foundation.Schola Canton. World Monument Fund. Retrieved July 14, 2016.Venice Synagogues Window Restoration. World Monument Fund. Retrieved March 16, 2020. Architecture For the observer standing in the square of the Ghetto Nuovo, the little cupola above the bimah is the only visible sign of the presence of the synagogue The synagogue's main room features a rectangular plan which is only slightly asymmetrical (12.9 x 7.1 x 12.7 x 6.5 m), in contrast to the marked irregularity of the ground plan in the nearby Scuola Grande Tedesca. It occupies an inconspicuous spot on the third floor of a four-story vernacular building facing the Ghetto's main square, and is hardly noticeable from the outside. An anonymous exterior was an indispensable feature for synagogues built in Venice in the early decades of the sixteenth century, since Jewish places of worship‚Äîalthough tolerated‚Äîwere still formally prohibited at that time. The synagogue stands on an elevated position (a feature shared with the nearby Scuola Grande Tedesca and Scuola Italiana) in accordance with Talmudic precepts about synagogue architecture; on a more practical note, the parcel where the building sits was owned by a prominent Venetian patrician family, but the raised placement put the synagogue under the direct control of the Jewish community. The first floor entrance to the synagogue building consists of a spacious and luminous lobby divided by two white tuscan columns; a stairway, lined with nineteenth- century plaques commemorating prominent members of the community, connects it to the third story synagogue. The current look of both the hall and the stairway is the result of a restoration carried out in the late 1850s. On the third floor, the synagogue is accessed through a narrow vestibule lined with benches; four windows placed on the vestibule's west wall (bricked up in 1847, and reopened in 1980) overlook the main room. The original function of such space‚Äîreminiscent of the anteroom (polish in Yiddish) often found in Central European synagogue buildings‚Äîis not clear; however, its layout suggests that it may have initially served as a matroneum. A new raised women's gallery was completed in 1736: from that moment on, and until 1847, the antechamber is thought to have been used by people unable to afford a seat in the main room. Due to the synagogue's modest dimensions, the number of places was in fact limited: owning a seat was considered a status symbol, and seats were often handed down through generations within prominent families. Interior The synagogue benefits of plenty of natural light thanks to the eleven large windows opening to the outside. The interior, heavily altered by the eighteenth-century interventions, is decorated in the Baroque style with some Rococo elements. The main focal points, the bimah and the ark, are placed at the opposite ends of the sanctuary: this was indeed the first Venetian synagogue to be built with the \\"bifocal effect\\", as the pulpit of the Scuola Grande Tedesca, later relocated, was originally placed in the middle of the room in accordance with the traditional \\"central bimah\\" configuration. The ark The intricately decorated ark is entirely gilded, as prescribed in the Book of Exodus with regard to the Ark of the Covenant; such abundance of gilt also reflects what was the decorative style in fashion in late seventeenth-century Venice. The ark occupies a deep niche in the southern wall facing Jerusalem, as typically seen in ancient synagogues. The niche protrudes outwards and is thus visible from the outside; this feature, characteristic of Venetian domestic architecture and once commonly seen in buildings throughout the city, is called liag√≤ (or diag√≤) and probably derived from Islamic architecture.Great German Synagogue. jvenice.org. Retrieved October 25, 2019. Above the ark, a small stained glass window with blue, yellow, red, and green accents provides additional light. The ark has a tripartite structure: the central section hosts the niche for the Torah scrolls, surmounted by a baroque broken pediment and flanked by two square pillars and two fluted Corinthian columns; the two lateral sections feature the seats for the parnassim with ornated curved backs, crowned by smaller broken pediments and enclosed on each side by Corinthian columns with oblique and vertical fluting. The marble steps leading to the closet feature an obscure inscriptions in Hebrew, which reads: The date mentioned in the inscription indicates \\"with great approximation\\" that of the construction of the ark; as previously noted, its decorative style is clearly reminiscent of that period. Above the parnassim seats are two wooden panels with texts from two Sabbath prayers. The bimah At the opposite end of the room is the bimah, which dates back to circa 1780. The raised polygonal pulpit, reached through five wooden steps and delicately decorated in the Rococo style, is surmounted by a semi-elliptical arch supported by four original columns of interlacing branches, reminiscent of the two pillars on the porch of Solomon's Temple. The columns, of exquisite workmanship, were carefully restored in the 1980s. The pulpit stands inside a semi-hexagonal niche, illuminated from above by a dome-shaped skylight, which was built around 1730. The wooden seats surrounding the pulpit were originally reserved for the most eminent members of the community. The eighteenth-century rearrangement of this section of the synagogue was most assuredly carried out by local Christian architect Bartolomeo Scalfurotto, who in the same period (aroud 1731) was working on the refurbishment of the fa√ßade of the Doge's Palace. Placed against the room's longer walls are two walnut benches whose decoration was completed in 1789, together with the gilding of the synagogue's interior. All the walls are subdivided into five horizontal sections; the number five recurs repeatedly throughout the synagogue (five are the openings on the two longer walls, as well as the steps leading to the bimah) as an evidence of its importance in Judaism. Two of the four walls are noteworthy for the presence of eight wooden panels with relief medallions depicting biblical episodes from the Book of Exodus, including the city of Jericho, the Crossing of the Red Sea, the Altar of Sacrifice, the Manna, the Ark on the banks of the Jordan River, Korah, the gift of the Torah, and Moses making water flow from the rock. The eight medallions, painted in tempera, are of no particular artistic merit, but do stand out for their rarity: landscape paintings are indeed an extremely uncommon feature in synagogues, and their presence in the Canton Synagogue may reflect the influence of Central European models. The medallions are in fact reminiscent of oval cartouches displayed on the frontispieces of Jewish books printed in Krak√≥w in the late sixteenth century.

In this capacity she observed: \\"I hope gender violence becomes an election issue. It would be good if candidates and incumbents standing for elections are made to ensure that they will guarantee safety for women in their area. Civil society should make this an issue, and that‚Äôs where the media also has a role to play\\". Since then, violence against has indeed become an electoral issue in India Tavares said: \\"When women are in positions of decision making, they make decisions differently, more attuned to safety, sanitation, water resources and health of families. They also have a different style of dialogue... things do change because of them and they also manage to change attitudes.\\" In December 2015, representing UN Women, Tavares signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in New Delhi with Dr. Jyotsna Suri, President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) to promote gender equality and Women‚Äôs empowerment in the corporate sector.

She spent eleven of the twelve Nazi years in prison, earning the soubriquet \\"Iron Johanna\\" (\\"Eiserne Johanna\\") because she stayed silent under torture. She survived and became, for a time, a regional politician in West Germany. Life Johanna Melzer was born in Oberwaldenburg, a mining village in Lower Silesia close to the German frontier with Bohemia, southwest of Breslau. Her father was a miner. While she was still a child the family relocated to the Ruhr region in connection with her father's work: she attended junior school in R√ºnthe, before moving on to a commercially focused secondary school in Hamm. Melzer trained for work as a sales assistant and for clerical employment. The family were politically conscious, and in 1923 she joined both the Communist Party and its youth wing. From 1925 till 1930 she was employed as a book keeper with the \\"Ruhr-Echo\\", a daily newspaper. Between 1925 and 1932 she lived with , a Communist activist to whom, she later wrote, she owed a large part of her own political awakening. Locally she became a leader of the Red Front Women's Alliance (\\"Rote Frauen und M√§dchenbund\\") in Bochum. In 1928/29 she was listed as the party's Agitation and Propaganda chief for the Bochum sub-district. In 1930 she moved to Thuringia where she became a member of the party regional leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in Erfurt. Here she also worked as the book keeper and treasurer of the local Red Aid (\\"Rote Hilfe\\") communist workers' welfare organisation. She remained in Erfurt till 1932, also serving as a party instructor and, towards the end of her time, leader in the women's department of the regional party leadership. By March 1933 she had returned to the Dortmund area. In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 Communists began to be arrested. From March 1933 Melzer was working illegally as a \\"party instructor\\" in the Dortmund area and in July 1933 she was arrested. She was placed in the Moringen concentration camp where she remained till December 1933. Soon after the Nazi take-over Melzer arranged that the \\"Oblies\\" dress shop in Dortmund, where she was a customer, would become a focal point for resistance activists. Various Communist Party newspapers were distributed from there, such as \\"The Red Flag\\" (\\"Die Rote Fahne\\") and \\"The International\\" as well as a publication that hid its identity behind the camouflaging name \\"Rolleiflex\\". Because of intelligence received from the Gestapo in Berlin. local police were already aware of this arrangement by the end of 1933, and of the significance of the phrase \\"I've come from the Lyon boutique\\" (\\"Ich komme vom Modehaus Lyon\\") which resistance fighters used to identify themselves. Along with her activities in Dortmund, Johanna Metzler worked illegally as a \\"party instructor\\" in Bielefeld, Osnabr√ºck and Hagen, in and beyond the eastern part of the Ruhr industrial conurbation. She herself was re-arrested on 26 August 1934 and held under investigatory detention, initially at the infamous \\"Steinwache\\" interrogation prison beside the Main Railway Station in Dortmund. She was held here for some time during which she underwent a sustained period of interrogation and sustained serious mistreatment, according to one source \\"isolated for weeks on end\\" and \\"bound hand and foot\\". It was during this time that she earned from fellow detainees the soubriquet \\"Iron Johanna\\" (\\"Eiserne Johanna\\") because she stayed silent under torture. A couple of weeks after her arrest, on 7 September 1934, she wrote a letter to her parents and family. The letter was intercepted by the prison censors, but today it is retained in the archives of the high court at Hamm, where it provides a lasting testimony to Johanna Metzler's mental strength and courage. She was subsequently transferred to Hamm where she appeared before the High Court on 1 March 1935, She was charged with \\"the crime of preparing a highly treasonable undertaking\\" (\\"Verbrechens der Vorbereitung eines hochverr√§terischen Unternehmens\\"). The prosecution demanded a death sentence, but the court sentenced her to a fifteen-year term of imprisonment plus ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Melzer spent the next ten years in a succession of prisons. War ended early in May 1945: she was liberated from prison by allied forces on 4 May 1945. She moved to Thuringia where she became head of the women's section with the Communist party leadership in Erfurt. Thuringia had been successfully invaded during the opening months of 1945 by the American army, but under terms already agreed between the allied leaders the area was to be incorporated into the Soviet occupation zone (after 1949 the German Democratic Republic). On 3 July 1945 the American military withdrew, and for the rest of Mezler's time in Erfurt the city was administered by the Soviets.Towards the end of 1946 she returned to Dortmund, now administered as part of the British occupation zone (after 1949 part of the German Federal Republic). Here she joined the party regional leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Ruhr region. She was appointed a member of the Westphalia provincial assembly in 1946, and following a return to democracy she was elected a member of its successor body, the Landtag (regional legislature) of North Rhine-Westphalia, for a three-year term starting in 1947. During her time in the assembly she was vocal in support of equal pay for women and in opposition to the production of more nuclear bombs. After this she was a co-founder, in 1950, of a West German outpost of the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD), becoming its secretary. In 1954 she became a member of the Communist Party Control Commission. It was not till August 1956 that the Communist Party was banned in West German (reflecting \\"the aggressive and combative methods that the party used as a \\"Marxist-Leninist party struggle\\" to achieve their goals\\") but as the political differences between East and West Germany became ever more stark, especially after the 1953 East German uprising, the Communist Party became increasingly marginalised in West Germany, and in 1953 Johanna Mezler faced an arrest warrant in connection with her political activity. The more direct concern for the authorities in West Germany appears to have involved not her Communist Party membership, but her position within the DFD which was seen as a proxy for the East German government and its ruling party. She went into hiding and appears to have avoided arrest. The political separation implicit in the military occupation zones created in 1945 came to be enforced by a physical frontier during the 1950s. In 1956 Melzer relocated to East Berlin where she lived till her death there on the night of 2/3 October 1960. There are suggestions that her health was damaged and her life thereby shortened by torture she had suffered at the hands of the Gestapo. Her sister Klara's attempts to have the 1953 indictment lifted posthumously were rejected by the West German authorities who inferred that her relocation to East Germany in 1956 was tantamount to a confession of guilt.

Life  Mandajors remained in his province until the age of seventeen. After having made some very hasty studies, and by that very imperfect, he went to Paris, where he established contacts with men of letters, by which he somehow compensated the deficiency of his early education. These connections were very helpful to his father who had published a book entitled, Nouvelles D√©couvertes sur l‚Äôancien √©tat de la Gaule au temps de C√©sar (New Discoveries on the former state of Gaul in Caesar's time). Sensing that this work would be exposed to criticism from scientists, the son Mandajors made efforts to save this vexation to his father and he succeeded. The New Discoveries were spared, and they remained in oblivion.

The framework covers the Kardar‚ÄìParisi‚ÄìZhang equation , the Phi_3^4 equation and the parabolic Anderson model, all of which require renormalization in order to have a well- defined notion of solution. Hairer won the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in mathematics for discovering regularity structures. Definition A regularity structure is a triple mathcal{T} = (A,T,G) consisting of: * a subset A (index set) of mathbb{R} that is bounded from below and has no accumulation points; * the model space: a graded vector space T = oplus_{alpha in A} T_{alpha} , where each T_{alpha} is a Banach space; and * the structure group: a group G of continuous linear operators Gamma colon T to T such that, for each alphain A and each tau in T_{alpha}, we have (Gamma-1)tau in oplus_{beta<alpha} T_{beta} . A further key notion in the theory of regularity structures is that of a model for a regularity structure, which is a concrete way of associating to any tau in T and x_{0} in mathbb{R}^{d} a \\"Taylor polynomial\\" based at x_{0} and represented by tau, subject to some consistency requirements. More precisely, a model for mathcal{T} = (A,T,G) on mathbb{R}^{d}, with d geq 1 consists of two maps :Pi colon mathbb{R}^{d} to mathrm{Lin}(T; mathcal{S}'(mathbb{R}^{d})), :Gamma colon mathbb{R}^{d} times mathbb{R}^{d} to G. Thus, Pi assigns to each point x a linear map Pi_{x}, which is a linear map from T into the space of distributions on mathbb{R}^{d}; Gamma assigns to any two points x and y a bounded operator Gamma_{x y}, which has the role of converting an expansion based at y into one based at x. These maps Pi and Gamma are required to satisfy the algebraic conditions :Gamma_{x y} Gamma_{y z} = Gamma_{x z}, :Pi_{x} Gamma_{x y} = Pi_{y}, and the analytic conditions that, given any r >  inf A , any compact set K subset mathbb{R}^{d}, and any gamma > 0, there exists a constant C > 0 such that the bounds : ( Pi_{x} tau ) varphi_{x}^{lambda}  leq C lambda^{tau}  tau _{T_{alpha}}, : Gamma_{x y} tau _{T_{beta}} leq C  x - y ^{alpha - beta}  tau _{T_{alpha}}, hold uniformly for all r-times continuously differentiable test functions varphi colon mathbb{R}^{d} to mathbb{R} with unit mathcal{C}^{r} norm, supported in the unit ball about the origin in mathbb{R}^{d}, for all points x, y in K, all 0 < lambda leq 1, and all tau in T_{alpha} with beta < alpha leq gamma. Here varphi_{x}^{lambda} colon mathbb{R}^{d} to mathbb{R} denotes the shifted and scaled version of varphi given by :varphi_{x}^{lambda} (y) = lambda^{-d} varphi left( frac{y - x}{lambda} right).

In Ghana, she has been described as the queen of jazz. Early life Stephanie Benson was born in Ghana to royal Parents, a pharmaceutical millionaire and his fourth wife named Queen Nana Boahemah II, who had seventeen children. Her musical career began at the age of three when she started learning how to play the piano. She added the violin and cello when she was enrolled at the National Academy of Music at the age of eight in the year 1975. She became interested in playing the piano after her father often played the instrument to her before bedtime. After her father's death in 1981 when she was fourteen, she moved to London, England to explore life in a different part of the world. During her stay in London, she channeled her energy into playing the piano under the watchful eye of her uncle, and later got a residency singing and playing in one of the famous nightclubs in London. * Strange Fellows nightclub in the US Career During one of Benson's usual shows in the London nightclub, she was spotted by Pete Waterman, owner of PWL, who offered her a contract with his label. The deal led her to record and release her first single, \\"Now is the Time\\", placing her in the top 20 on UK dance charts. Benson went on a promotional tour across Europe until her contract with PWL came to an end. She then started writing and collaborating with artists including Stevie Wonder, Wayne Vaughn (Earth Wind and Fire), Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue), Terry Britton (Tina Turner), Andy Hill (Bucks Fizz) and Danny Schogger (Celine Dion). Social activity In a bid to groom potential stars of Ghanaian talent in all fields of the industry, in April 2013 Benson announced the establishment of a music school named the Benson Entertainment Production Institute (BEPI) in Accra. BEPI is intended to promote professional international standards relating to stage performances and rehearsals, theatre shows, TV shows and musical concerts, and training, as well as to serve commercial purposes. The first performance of students from BEPI was in 2014 at +233 Jazz Bar and Grill, Accra. Surviving breast cancer On 29 October 2015, Benson underwent surgery for breast cancer, a situation she described as shocking when she was diagnosed, revealing that she had lost her grandmother, mother and other relatives to the disease. Following her survival, she trained to do a mountain walk in France on 1 September 2016 with the Dutch \\"Singing for your Life\\" team to raise funds towards a cancer research and mobile mammogram unit for Ghana, and support for the Dutch Cancer Society. Benson has publicly talked about surviving breast cancer after undergoing a total of 28 hours of surgery within three days. On 19 March 2016, at Labadi Beach Hotel's Omanye Hall in Accra, she held a women's gathering centred on her fight against breast cancer with the aim of encouraging and strengthening women amidst music and words of exhortation. She released her song titled \\"Dear Lord\\" at this event, which was attended by notable women including Nana Ama McBrown, Michelle McKinney- Hammond as well as singers Akosua Agyapong, Irene Logan, Yaa Yaa and Becca. Personal life Benson is an older sister of Ghanaian highlife singer, Akosua Agyapong. She is married to John, and together they have five children. The couple own a chocolate shop located in The Pantiles, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent.  Brand Ambassador  In October 2018, 3Foundation made her a brand ambassador to lead a breast cancer awareness campaign where she helped raised funds to support women affected by breast cancer to undergo resconstructive surgeries. Performances for the British royal household Since taking on music commercially, Benson has entertained celebrities and important personalities at public and private events including the British royal household and Prince Charles, who said upon hearing her sing the first time, \\"You are one of the most amazing performers I've ever seen.\\" Benson has performed at events hosted by the British royals including Princess Anne, and reportedly exceeded her 15-minute allotted performance time for Prince Charles to approximately an hour because he enjoyed her act. She received another invitation to sing for Prince William before his wedding to Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011. Accident On 22 April 2014 Benson was involved in a car accident. Following this, she released a gospel single titled \\"My Prayer\\" as a way of showing appreciation and gratitude to God for saving her from the accident. Discography Since moving back to Ghana, Benson has released a number of albums, including Different Kind of Heaven, What are you doing with your life and Friend in 2015, as well as Dear Lord and I am worth it in 2016.

History  Although started in 2015, the initiative was worked on as a research project for two years before that time. Software Heritage began public operations on June 30, 2016. It was formed under the auspices of the French research institute, French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria), which hosts the initiative on its servers. The budget Inria is providing for the project is ‚Ç¨500,000 over three years. Software Heritage was founded by computer scientists Roberto Di Cosmo and Stefano Zacchiroli. Its repository holds over 20 million software projects, with an archive of over 2.7 billion unique source files as of July 2016. Additional sponsors of the Software Heritage initiative include Microsoft and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research's Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS). Creative Commons, Free Software Foundation, GitHub, Jason Scott, the Linux Foundation, and Microsoft among others have endorsed the project.  Overview  Software Heritage's goal is to preserve software in its original source code that is free/open source software (FOSS). The focus of the initiative is to collect, preserve, and share software that is across cultural heritage, industry, education, science, and research communities, with the concern that software that is made up of technical and scientific knowledge will be lost without preservation. The project came about because software code is seen as being even more vulnerable to corruption and obsolescence than typical archival holdings like books and other media like video and film. The interface is built using open source code, with an initial focus on search, where end-users search by SHA-1 hashes. The Software Heritage initiative is open to scientific researchers, with the idea that it would be a Library of Alexandria type resource for software. Additionally, Software Heritage will be an infrastructure resource upon which developers can build applications on top of the archive. Another goal is to get guidance from researchers on what features might be valuable as a way to structure output and collection curation. Other grass-roots initiatives exist, like archivist Jason Scott's Textfiles.com project, the Code Archive (which attempts to archive GitHub), as well as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Software Heritage is gathering software that has free licenses from sources that include GitHub, Debian package archive, and GNU Project FTP archive and from entities like Gitorious and Google Code, projects that no longer exist. The archive is structured so knowledge can be preserved, enabling continuous access to digital information, as well as creating a building block for thematic portals and collections of software. The initiative can be used to create better software for the industry, where original software has often been lost. Software Heritage will ensure long-term preservation of software, making software provenance more traceable, integrated, and reusable, with an ability to know licensing (which is not always present) and use constraints, track security vulnerabilities, and assist in the discovery of prior code assets.  Awards  In 2016 Software Heritage received the best community project award at Paris Open Source Summit 2016. In 2019 Software Heritage received the award of Academic Initiative from the P√¥le Systematic.

She also criticised the way men expected the women who had contributed to the independence movement to go back to a less politically active life once the new state was established.Telegraph of India, 4 Feb 2002  Scholarship  Dr. Uma Bhatt is a linguist in the Department of Hindi at Kumaon University, Nainital, with a specialist knowledge of Himalayan languages.

Fountain-head; The head of the SpringPalmer, 1881, p. 10), is a place abounding with immense fountains, with reservoirs and aqueducts south of Tyre, and ca. south of Beirut, in the South Governorate (Liban-Sud), in the municipality of Batouliyat. The place lies in a very green and fertile plain, about one kilometer from the sea coast. It is a popular tourist destination, owing to its artesian wells fed by underground springs and collected in stone reservoirs that have been maintained through the ages.General Tourist Information about Tyre It has been the main source of water for ancient Tyre since Phoenician days. One of the reservoirs fed the arched aqueducts of the Roman period, and which once stretched all the way to Tyre. Remains of these aqueducts, exhibiting strong and excellent masonry, with round arches and a continuous cornice above them, can still be seen today, Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. 386‚Äì388 and a short stretch of the original aqueduct is still used today in Tyre's present-day waterworks. Ras al-Ain in 1900 (Gertrude Bell Archive, Newcastle University) A reference to this place is mentioned in the 3rd century Mosaic of Rehob as Rosh Mayya (Fountain-head).Safrai, Z. (1977), p. 17 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it: \\"A village built of stone, containing about 100 Metawileh, in the plain, surrounded by gardens of figs, pomegranates, mulberries, and olives. Five mills in the village, and near, in working order,a good many ruined.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 50-51 They further noted about the water-ways: This is the spring-head which supplied ancient Tyre by means of a long aqueduct. The springs are enclosed in four strongly-built reservoirs, as at Tabghah, by means of which the water is raised to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet, in order that an aqueduct with a slight fall should be able to carry it to the neighbourhood of Tyre. The walls of these reservoirs are of large well-dressed ashlar-work, and vary in thickness. The stones are joined and coated on the inside with strong cement. The principal reservoir is octagonal in shape, with sides of irregular length. Its diameter measures sixty-six feet, and it is twenty-five feet above the ground. The retaining walls are very thick, and show traces of modern repairs in one part. They have so gentle a slope that it is not difficult to ride up on to the broad border eight feet wide round the spring.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 69-70 See also Tyre District References Bibliography (p. 432] External links *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 1: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Ras el-Ain, in the Tyre District, Lebanon Archaeological sites in Lebanon Roman aqueducts outside Rome Tyre District Geography of Lebanon Shia Muslim communities in Lebanon ","title":"Ras al-Ain, Lebanon"},{"id":"51170714","text":"Pisgah, Texas, is a ghost town that was located in Navarro County, Texas, about 12 miles south of Corsicana.

The organization strove to enhance women's rights in the areas of education, employment, and suffrage. It also aimed to protect women from venereal disease by attempting to prevent men with these diseases from marrying, as well as by allowing women whose husbands had these diseases to get a divorce. The organization played an important role in changing Article 5 of the Public Peace Police Law, which had prohibited women from participating in public meetings. NWA also enlisted the help of men as advocates for women in politics. The organization is widely credited for raising the issue of women's rights in Japan and influencing the Diet's decision to expand them. The Diet passed changes to Article 5 of the Public Peace Police Law in 1922. The organization disbanded in the same year under the authority of leader Hiratsuka Raich≈ç.  Purpose  The New Women‚Äôs Association was formed in an effort to allow women both freedom and the right to vote. The group's aims included raising the \\"social and political position of women in Japan.\\" Furthermore, the organization strove to obtain gender equality in education and employment. The leaders, Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, Ichikawa Fusae, and Oku Mumeo also focused on repealing or modifying Article 5 of the Public Police Law. This law prohibited women from participating in political activity publicly. The organization drafted two petitions advocating women's political rights. In addition to this, the organization aimed to stop men with venereal disease from getting married. The group both lobbied for and drafted a petition in favor of this with the goal of protecting the women whose husbands had or would later contract a sexually transmitted disease. The petition that was drafted for this purpose would have also given a woman the right to divorce her husband if he had venereal disease or contracted one during their marriage. This petition gained more traction than the organization‚Äôs attempts to obtain women‚Äôs suffrage and rights, and even gained the support of the Japan Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union.  History  The New Women‚Äôs Association was formed in post-World War I Japan. This new organization formed under the leadership of figures such as Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, who was one of the founders of Bluestocking. Hiratsuka Raich≈ç asked Ichikawa Fusae to form a women's rights organization with Oku Mumeo starting in 1919. Oku had recently had a son, and she would carry him on her back to NWA meetings and use the pram to carry copies of the group's journal, Women's League (Josei d≈çmei). The organization petitioned the Diet in order to bring about changes that would allow women to be politically involved, among other issues. On January 6, 1920, Hiratsuka, Ichikawa, and Oku gathered at Hiratsuka's residence. At this gathering, the three women and other activists drafted two petitions. One of the petitions was created to grant women citizenship and the ability to be politically active, while the other petition was created to protect women and require men to get tested for syphilis before getting married. The second petition also would have granted wives the ability to divorce their husbands and receive compensation in these cases. NWA's first meeting was held on February 21, 1920 in Tokyo at the YMCA hall in Kanda. This first meeting had around 500 in attendance and 70% of the audience were male. The official charter of the group and membership rules were later announced on March 28, 1920. As of 1921, there were 412 members of the organization. In 1920, Ichikawa Fusae left the New Women's Association. She was in the United States for two-and-a-half years, though her departure from the New Women's Association came largely as a result of Ichikawa and Hiratsuka's differing opinions. Changes to Article 5 were passed in 1922, approved by both houses of the Diet. The New Women‚Äôs Association disbanded in the same year under the authority of Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, who was sick at the time.  Critics of the NWA  Ichikawa and Hiratsuka differed politically and personally, so in 1920, Ichikawa left the NWA. Other critics of the NWA included Yamakawa Kikue and It≈ç Noe, who felt that NWA was lacking a socialist perspective. Further criticisms included the argument that the organization only represented middle and upper class women. These critics argued that the group failed to represent women who were poor, in the working class, or had children, as only women with free time would be able to be politically active. One group that sympathized with these arguments was the Red Wave Society, which was another women's organization active at the same time as the New Women's Association.

It offers more autonomous capabilities and advanced control applications. It is composed of three modules: Bus, Repeater and Earth Facing Antennas. Only two satellites have used this bus: Amos-4, massing and generating 6 kW of power. And Amos-6 at and generating 10 kW. But Amos-6 is enhanced by using electric propulsion for station keeping only. Orbit raising is still done by the more traditional and faster chemical propulsion. AMOS E The next development of the AMOS platform is the implementation of pure electric propulsion. The increased efficiency for orbit raising and station keeping in comparison to chemical propulsion can result in reductions of mass of up to 50%.

Ballenger Sr. (December 5, 18661951) was one of the five men who organized and owned the Buick Motor Company, bringing it to Flint, Michigan, in 1905. He was elected secretary and treasurer of Buick until 1908 when the firm was purchased by General Motors, which he had also helped form. Born in Cambridge City, Indiana, Ballenger went to Flint in 1888 to become a stenographer and bookkeeper for the Flint Wagon Works. This company was subsequently absorbed by the Little Motor Car Company and Ballenger became the secretary and treasurer of Little. When Little sold out to Chevrolet in 1913, Ballenger became the treasurer of Chevrolet, a position he kept until his retirement in 1926. Ballenger was a member of the Flint Board of Education for six years and made generous bequests to Flint Junior College, later renamed Mott Community College. The main athletic facility on the campus, the William S. Ballenger Field house, was named in his honor. The Ballenger Eminent Persons Lecture Series, endowed by Ballenger for the College, has been one of the most prestigious forums for visiting speakers in Michigan during the past six decades. Ballenger established two privately owned parks within the City of Flint, Memorial Park and Ballenger Park. Ballenger Highway, which forms most of the western city limits of Flint, is named after him, largely because he was the principal benefactor of a major hospital, now part of McLaren Health Care Corporation. He was also chairman of the board of directors of the Citizens Commercial & Savings Bank (now part of FirstMerit Corporation).

She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called daughter of his body. On a relief found at Saqqara she is called his beloved daughter and king's daughter. Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the noble woman Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.Nozomu Kawai: The New Kingdom Tomb Chapel of Isisnofret at Northwest Saqqara, in: Jiro Kondo (editor): Quest for the Dream of the Pharaohs, Studies on Honour of Sakuji Yoshimura, Cairo 2014, , p. 69-90  References  Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt Ancient Egyptian women ","title":"Isetnofret (daughter of Khaemwaset)"},{"id":"51170969","text":"Eunidia aspersa is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The garden is managed by Elizabeth Street Garden, Inc. (ESG), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and open to the public for general use and community events by ESG volunteers. City-owned and privately leased, the Garden is open to the public daily, weather permitting. Neighborhood volunteers operate the Garden year-round and program more than 200 free, public educational, wellness and arts-related events annually for children, seniors and all who live and work in the community. History The original site of P.S. 106, later renamed P.S. 21 designed by master school architect C.B.J. Snyder in 1903 with public outdoor space that functioned as a neighborhood social and civic center. The school stood at least through the mid-to-late 1970s. In 1981, the Little Italy Restoration Apartments were built on Spring St., including much of the former school site. Plans to build a new school never panned out due to community opposition and the school‚Äôs playground became a vacant 20,000-sq-ft lot with frontage on Elizabeth and Mott streets, between Prince and Spring streets that eventually became the garden. In 1990, Manhattan Community Board 2 Parks Committee passed a resolution in favor of leasing it to Allan Revier, owner of Elizabeth Street Gallery located in a renovated 1850s New York City firehouse adjacent to the garden property on Elizabeth Street, on a month-to-month basis. In 1991, the garden was developed and created by Reiver who planted an array of perennial flowers, native plants, and trees with a display of architectural remnants, gates, fencing, statuary, tables, and seating from his gallery collection. Beginning in 2005, the garden was accessible to the public through the Gallery. In 2013 the garden became the subject of a public debate surrounding the development of public housing or to establish a more community-centered public green space. Community members worked with Reiver to revitalize the space and open the front gates to the public, introducing public programming and developing a significant base of support for retaining the green space for community use. In August 2014 this group formed into Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden, Inc. (FESG). In April 2017, members of FESG and the original community group branched off to form Elizabeth Street Garden (ESG) which now manages the garden, keeping the space open to the public seven days a week and providing free public and educational programming for the community. In June 2019, the City Council voted unanimously to redevelop the garden into affordable senior housing. The new development is projected to have 123 non- permanent affordable apartments for seniors, programming for its residents, luxury ground-floor retail, 11,200 square feet of office space for the developer partner, Habitat NYC, and approximately 6,600 square feet of privately-owned open space. Councilmember Margaret Chin and Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer both supported the redevelopment despite opposition from community members, the local community board, state Senators and Assembly members. In March 2019, Elizabeth Street Garden (ESG) filed a lawsuit to stop the proposed development. ESG is currently represented by Norman Siegel. {{Cite weburl=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/nyregion/garden-little- italy-senior-housing.html} Gallery Elizabeth_St._community_sculpture_garden_NYC_3.jpg Elizabeth_St._community_sculpture_garden_NYC_8.jpg Elizabeth_St._community_sculpture_garden_NYC_10.jpg Elizabeth_St._community_sculpture_garden_NYC_11.jpg Elizabeth_St._community_sculpture_garden_NYC_16.jpg See also *Community Gardens in New York City *Community gardening in the United States References External links History of Community-Gardens at NYCGovParks.org Nolita Parks in Manhattan 1991 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Elizabeth Street Garden"},{"id":"51171185","text":"Wesam Malik (born 1 January 1989) is an Iraqi footballer who plays as a midfielder for Naft Al-Janoob in the Iraq Premier League, as well as the Iraq national team.

The doctors and scientists of Doheny Eye Institute undertake basic and clinical research, a role known as a physician- scientist. History 175px In 1944, Carrie Estelle Doheny, wife of the prominent Los Angeles oilman Edward L. Doheny, became blind in her left eye and began to suffer a progressive loss of sight in her right eye. The loss of vision inspired her to create and fund the organization named for her, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation, in 1947. The foundation was formed with the purpose of supporting ‚Äúthe conservation, improvement and restoration‚Äù of human eyesight. The Doheny Pavilion, at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, opened to patients in 1956. Drs. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., and S. Rodman Irvine served as co-Medical Directors. Dr. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., served as the personal ophthalmologist of Carrie Estelle Doheny, as well of American entrepreneur Walt Disney. In 1966, USC invited the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation Trustees to inspect an available parcel on the USC Health Sciences Campus, and negotiations to acquire the property began. In 1971, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation finalized its formal affiliation agreement with USC, and named William H. Spencer, MD, as its new Medical Director, forming what was then called the \\"Doheny Eye Institute.\\" In 1977, Stephen J. Ryan became Medical Director and proposed the creation of the Doheny Eye Hospital, to serve as a new headquarters and provide clinical facilities for the ophthalmology faculty. The hospital was officially dedicated in 1985. In 1987, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation was renamed the Doheny Eye Institute, and a $32 million campaign was launched to build the Doheny Eye Institute building. Shortly thereafter, Stephen J.

The Doheny Retina Institute was established in 2001, followed by the Doheny Image Reading Center (DIRC) in 2003.

It is a metre based on French alexandrine.Jacek Baluch, Piotr Gierowski, Czesko-polski s≈Çownik termin√≥w literackich, Krak√≥w 2016, p. 37 (in Polish).For more about the French alexandrin, see Roy Lewis, On Reading French Verse. A study of Poetic Form. Oxford 1982, pp.43-69. The most important features of the pattern are number of syllables (twelve or thirteen) and a caesura after the sixth syllable. It is an unusual metre, exhibiting characteristics of both syllabic and syllabotonic (accentual-syllabic) metre. Thus it occupies a transitional position between syllabic and accentual patterns of European versification. It stands out from the background of modern Czech versification, which is modeled chiefly after German practice. The Czech alexandrine is also metrically ambiguous because of its accentuation, which can reflect the rhythms of iambic hexameter, dactylic tetrameter, and combinations thereof.Jerzy (Ji≈ô√≠) Lev√Ω, W sprawie ≈õcis≈Çych metod analizy wiersza, [in:] Poetyka i matematyka. Edited by Maria Renata Mayenowa, Warszawa 1965, p. 40 (in Polish) Compared with iambic hexameter and dactylic tetrameter, the Czech alexandrine preserves all constants between the two, and allows the rhythms of either to emerge: iambic hexameter: s S _s S s_ S  s S _s S s_ S _(s)_ dactylic tetrameter: S s _s S s_ s  S s _s S s_ s _(s)_ Czech alexandrine: o o _s S s_ o  o o _s S s_ o _(s)_ S=stressed syllable; s=unstressed syllable; o=either. The Czech alexandrine allows these two rhythms run parallel to each other;Compare: Josef Brukner, Ji≈ô√≠ Filip, Poetick√Ω slovn√≠k, Praha 1997, p.18 (in Czech). sometimes the first is stronger, other times the second. In the Czech language the first syllable of every lexical word or prepositional phrase is always stressed, so rhythmical units are: s, S, Ss, Sss, Ssss. A great advantage of the Czech alexandrine is that it can be built of any words (or phrases). A half-line can be composed of 1-syllable words (stressed or unstressed), 2-syllable words, 3-syllable words, and 4-syllable words. Possible combinations in the first half-line (with \`\` separating words) include: sSsSsS, sSsSss, SssSsS, SssSss ‚Äî for the second half-line: sSsSsS, sSsSss, SssSsS, SssSss, sSsSsSs, SssSsSs, sSsSsss, SssSsss. Czech poets usually use both masculine and feminine alexandrine lines, but sometimes they choose to apply only one kind. The first poet to use the Czech alexandrine (in his 1836 poem \\"M√°j\\") was Karel Hynek M√°cha, considered the greatest Czech poet. Although the discussed metre was theoretically fully iambic, he inserted many trisyllabic words into his lines: S s s S s s  S s s S s S V jezeru zelen√©m b√≠l√Ω je pt√°k≈Ø sbor, s S s S s S s S s S s s s a lehk√Ωch ƒçl≈Ønk≈Ø bƒõh i rychl√© veslov√°n√≠ The variation in rhythms can be heard in a formally equivalent paraphrase: \\"Hr√°l kdosi na hoboj\\" (\\"Somebody played oboe\\") by Karel Hlav√°ƒçek is a short poem in Czech alexandrines: Karel Hlav√°ƒçek, \\"Hr√°l kdosi na hoboj\\". Many poets used the Czech alexandrine in the 20th century, both in original works and in translations. Among them there were V√≠tƒõzslav Nezval, Ji≈ô√≠ Orten, Ivan Blatn√Ω, Vladim√≠r Holan and Old≈ôich Vyhl√≠dal. The caesura formula is a good base for enjambment. Sometimes a sentence runs from caesura to next caesura, as in \\"The Seventh Elegy\\" by Ji≈ô√≠ Orten:Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, Ji≈ô√≠ Orten - poeta formy kunsztownej, Pamiƒôtnik S≈Çowia≈Ñski, XLIX, 1999, p. 79.

Witnesses later recounted that Sawina shouted anti- Muslim expletives and claimed he was \\"going to kill [them] all.\\" The attack was condemned by civil rights groups as part of a larger rise of Islamophobia in the United States leading up the 2016 presidential election.  Background  Minneapolis has a large immigrant Somali-Muslim population and there have been several anti-Muslim and anti-Somali incidents in Minnesota within the past few years. On Oct. 30, 2015, Asma Jama (a Muslim woman of Somali descent and Kenyan nationality) was beaten for speaking Swahili in an Applebee's in the outskirts of Minneapolis. The perpetrator for that violence was charged with third-degree assault. A week prior to the shooting, a Muslim halal shop in the city was vandalized. According to a study by Georgetown University, the amount of Anti-Muslims increased during the 2016 presidential election. In September 2016, Minnesota was one of 20 states assessed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. They found that while hate crimes overall climbed 5 percent in 2015, crimes targeting Muslims soared 78 percent, with a comparable increase projected this year. Attack Anthony Sawina, aged 26, was leaving a bar with friends at 2:30 a.m. when they encountered a group of five Somali men wearing traditional qamis, who had been playing basketball nearby and were walking towards their car. The Somali men were on their way to a mosque for Ramadan prayers. One of Sawina's friends said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that dress you‚Äôre wearing?‚Äù and offered to shake hands. Instead of shaking hands, the Somali men continued to climb into their car and another of Sawina's companions shouted, ‚ÄúFuck Muslims.‚Äù When one of the Somalis objected to the remark, Sawina allegedly shouted, \\"What if someone said it? What if?\\" At this point, Sawina was alleged to have drawn a gun and begun shooting at the Somalis, hitting the car windshield. Two of the Somalis were shot in the leg and treated at a hospital. The victims later stated they heard Sawina say \\"I‚Äôm going to kill you all.\\" Investigation Anthony Sawina had two previous convictions for carrying a handgun without a permit. Sawina was charged with multiple counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon. His bail was set at $75,000 and faced up to seven years in prison. The police confirmed on June 30 that they were investigating the incident as a hate crime. The FBI also reviewed the case as a hate crime and for potential federal civil rights charges. Trial Sawina was tried on nine counts of felony, including attempted murder in the first degree. On May 11, 2017, Sawina was convicted of all charges, including attempted first- degree murder. Sawina received a 39-year sentence, which prompted him to angrily rebuke the judge. Sawina appealed his sentence in 2018 as excessive. Reactions Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison called for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the crime. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota (CAIR-MN), stated the attack was evidence of growing tension and fear for Muslims across America. Hassan Jama of the Islamic Association of North America called on \\"all Americans to stand with us, all Minnesotans to stand with us\\" and condemn the shooting as a hate crime. Following Sawina's conviction, CAIR-MN welcomed the result, stating it was justified. The shooting was one of the hate crimes cited by the FBI in October 2016.

Typically it is made from expanded pellets ('EPE bead') made with use of a blowing agent, followed by expansion into a mold in a steam chest - the process is similar to that used to make expanded polystyrene foam. Properties EPE foams are low density, semi-rigid, closed cell foam that are generally somewhere in stiffness/compliance between Expanded polystyrene and Polyurethane. Production of EPE foams is similar to that of expanded polystyrene, but starting with PE beads. Typical densities are with the lower figure being common. Densities as low as can be produced. Base polymer for EPE foams range from Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to High-density polyethylene (HDPE). Co-polymers Expanded polyethylene copolymers (EPC) are also known - such as 50:50 (weight) materials with polystyrene. Though other properties are intermediate between the two bases, toughness for the copolymer exceeds either, with good tensile and puncture resistance. It is particularly applicable for re-usable products. Production EPE foams were first manufactured in the 1970s. Production of the PE beads is usually by extrusion, followed by chopping, producing a 'pellet'. Autoclave expansion is the most common route the bead foam. Butane or pentane is often used as a blowing agent (before 1992 CFCs may have been used). Depending on the specific process uses the beads may be cross-linked either by electron beam irradiation (see Electron beam processing), or by the addition of a chemical agent such as Dicumyl peroxide. An alternate route (JSP Process) to the beads uses carbon dioxide as a blowing agent which is impregnated into the pellets in an autoclave at a temperature close to the plastic's crystalline melting point. The pellets are foamed by \\"flashing\\" into the (lower pressure) atmosphere to expand. Finally molding is done by steam chest compression molding; usually the low pressure variant of the process is used, though the high pressure variant may be used for HDPE based EPE foams. Uses  Polyethylene bead foams (including) EPE can be used to replace both polystyrene foam, and both rigid and flexible polyurethane. Uses include cushioning applications, and impact absorption applications including packaging. Consumption of polyethylene for PE foam was estimated at 114x106 kg in 2001. The majority was used for non-crosslinked foams, but crosslinked PE foams represented a significant (~ one third) fraction of demand. Use in protective packaging represented the largest use sector for such foams.

She has released two EPs, Unbelievable (2008) and Erase It (2014), and a studio album, One Girl (2011). Starting in 2016, Cox competed in four consecutive Miss District of Columbia contests. After winning the 2019 contest, she competed in Miss America 2020. She also represented the state of Missouri in the Miss Earth United States 2016 contest.  Biography  Katelynne Cox was born on June 28, 1994, to Cameron Cox and Wendy Sturm, and grew up in Camas, Washington. Cox began competing in modeling competitions since she was seven, winning numerous state and national titles, including Miniature Miss Washington and Miss Washington Jr. Pre-teen. In 2009, she won the Miss American Teen Jr title at the National Miss American Coed Pageant. In 2008, at the age of fourteen, she launched her music career with the EP Unbelievable. In 2010 she appeared in two editions of Supermodels Unlimited, the second of which featured her on the cover. Cox explained that she was hoping that her magazine appearances would garner publicity for her music career, which she considered her primary goal. The recording process for her album, which would be titled One Girl, took place in Nashville over the course of two years. Halfway through the process, Cox converted to Christianity. Although her lyrical focus changed after her conversion, she opted to keep the pop songs she had already recorded, as she felt that those songs could reach an audience that would not listen to Christian music. The album was released in 2011 through Red Hammer Records. In 2014, Cox released a second EP, Erase It, independently. From 2012 through 2014, Cox worked as a news anchor and producer at KOMU-TV. In 2015, Cox, now a college graduate, was hired by the office of Representative Sam Graves as a legislative correspondent and staffer. She currently works at the United States Chamber of Commerce, a business-oriented lobbying firm. She also worked for the Sports & Entertainment Network as an anchor and analyst. In 2016, Cox competed in Miss District of Columbia, which selects a representative to compete in the Miss America pageant, and finished as Second Runner-Up. She competed as Miss Missouri in the 2016 Miss Earth United States contest. Cox competed again in the Miss District of Columbia pageants in 2017 and 2018, and each time again finished as Second Runner-Up. Cox was part of the Washington Capitals' cheerleading team, the Red Rockers, from 2017 through 2019. In 2019, her final year of eligibility, Cox won the Miss District of Columbia title. At the Miss America 2020 contest, Cox was a finalist for the Women in Business Scholarship awards. After the contest, Cox posted a video in which she alleged that the Miss America Organization and NBC tried to prevent her from mentioning in her introduction speech that she is a rape survivor nor allowed her to speak about her social impact initiative, Silence Is Not Compliance, which seeks to educate women about, and prevent, sexual assault. Miss America responded to the allegations, stating that it was specifically the website of Silence Is Not Compliance that Cox was prohibited from mentioning, not larger content of her prepared remarks.  Education  Cox attended La Salle High School, and at the age fifteen was awarded a full scholarship to Clark University. She graduated both Clark University and Mountain View High School in 2012. During 2011 she also studied engineering at Vanderbilt University. After obtaining her Associate degree, she attended the University of Missouri, studying communications and political science and graduating in 2014 with a Bachelor's and Master's in Public Administration.

Originally known as the 1YA Building and then the Television New Zealand building, the building was purchased by the University of Auckland and modified in 2000‚Äì01. Located in Shortland Street in the Auckland CBD, the \\"strikingly original structure\\" built in 1934 is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I building. The Gus Fisher Gallery is located in the building. Use for radio The building was originally built in 1934 as a new home for 1YA, one of Auckland‚Äôs first two licensed radio stations in 1923 (alongside 1YB), making it the first purpose-built public radio building in New Zealand. The 1YA studios were commissioned by the conservative 24th New Zealand Parliament, led by the United Party, and designed by Norman Wade and Alva Bartley (Wade & Bartley), architects of De Bretts (also in Shortland Street) and the New Zealand Power Board building (Queen Street) - it was officially opened on 23 January 1935 by Postmaster General Adam Hamilton. It would go on to play an important role in the social programme of the first Labour government, formed from the November 1935 election and led by Michael Joseph Savage who was a strong advocate for public broadcasting. Renowned recording engineer and producer, Wahanui Wynyard, did some of his earliest work in the 1YA studios, including sessions with The Bluestars, from which a single was released in the UK by Decca. Architecture Described as neo- Romanesque in style,\\"Launch brings SCAPA to life\\". The University of Auckland News. March 2001: 4 and deceptively large, the structure presents a single storey fa√ßade to Shortland Street, but extends for another three levels down the hill to Fort Street at the back. Requirements of early radio broadcasting technology dictated that the building be solid and soundproof. Thick double brick walls block out noise, and copper framed arched 'windows' reveal a second layer of brick rather than a view of the interior. Bricks were supplied by Amalgamated Brick Brick & Pipe Company Ltd., the parent company for Crown Lynn Potteries, and designed to graduate from red to yellow in eight different bands of colour progressing up the face of the building - the brickwork plans are held by the University of Auckland's architecture archive and some of these were exhibited in 2011 for the Gus Fisher Gallery exhibition Crown Lynn: Pottery for the People. Use for television and music The building was converted into a television studio, AKTV2, and was the site of the first official broadcast of television in New Zealand on 1 June 1960. It remained the centre of the nation's television broadcasting from Auckland until 1990 when Television New Zealand (TVNZ) relocated to its present Miles Warren- designed base on Hobson Street. Sentimental regard for the old building, commonly known as the Shortland Street Studios, lives on in the titling of a certain long running hospital soap, Shortland Street, which was originally planned to be filmed in the building. In the 1990s the building, with its purpose-built studio environs, became a natural base for a range of musicians and producers, including Dave Dobbyn, The Submariner and York Street Studio. The many recordings made in this period include albums from The Mutton Birds, Che Fu and Pitch Black. Parts of the Kenneth Myers Centre still function as recording and rehearsal studios and are regularly used by musicians from the University of Auckland's School of Music. Use as a gallery Purchased by the University from TVNZ in 2000, the building was extensively and authentically restored and renovated. The principal benefactor was Douglas Myers and the building got named in honour of his father, Kenneth Myers.\\"Our Donors\\". Ingenio. Spring (2008). 10.

While most of the interior has always been very plain, the main foyer features a coloured glass dome lit from above, encircled by elaborately decorated plaster, originally painted in seven colours. This has been painted white to accentuate the pink, green and tobacco coloured glass in the dome. The original bronze 1YA entrance lamps at the building's entrance were removed when the building was refitted for television in 1959 and ended up at a private home in Siota Cres, Kohimarama. To complete a condition of a city council resource consent (issued in 2000 with a 2005 deadline) that allowed the University to restore the building, at the prompting of artist Billy Apple, a new set of lamps were produced and installed on 23 October 2009.

Ghlam is denying the accusations.  The case  On 19 April 2015, Aur√©lie Ch√¢telain, a dance instructor, was found shot dead in her burnt-out car in Villejuif, outside Paris. Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a French-Algerian student, shortly after sought medical help in Paris for gun wounds in one of his arms. His behaviour raised suspicion, leading French authorities to check his car, a Renault M√©gane where they found a Kalashnikov rifle, a revolver and a bullet proof vest. In his apartment they found three more Kalashnikovs and another weapon. He was detained at the hospital. Information found in Ghlam‚Äôs home and on his telephone led the police to believe he was planning an immediate attack on a church, being instructed by a French-speaking man in Syria. Allegedly, he had a list of further target churches, including the Sacre Coeur in Paris and, the Daily Express claimed, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray in Normandy that was attacked in July 26 2016. Ghlam had according to the police been in Turkey in February the same year, and at the time expressed a wish to go to Syria. He had been warned by police when he returned from Turkey, but had not been considered a serious security risk by the authorities.Soren Seelow (3 August 2015) Sid Ahmed Ghlam, entre les mailles du filet Le Monde Some days after the incident, Ghlam was charged with murder, attempted murder, association with criminals with a view to commit crimes against people and other crimes ‚Äúconnected to a terrorist organisation‚Äù.Kim Willsher (24 April 2015) French student charged with murder and links to a terrorist organisation The Guardian Le Monde reported that Ghlam's arrest stopped him from following through on his next targets, which possibly were the two churches of Villejuif and/or the Sacr√©- C≈ìur Basilica. Ghlam's DNA was found on Ch√¢telain and in the car where she died. The authorities have not identified a clear motive for the alleged murder. Initially, they suggested Ghlam might have tried to steal her car. Another possible motive that has been put forward is that Ghlam might have mistaken her for being an official spying on him.

Kuravanji poems are used in famous dance forms like Bharatanatyam where dancers perform the roles of Kurathi and other characters as depicted in the poetry with recitations of the poems with music.  Author  This book, popularly known as Kuravanchi Natakam, was composed by Trikutarasabba Kavirayar, a courtier of the northern king Chinnananjath Thevar. He hails from Melakaram near Tenkasi in Tirunelveli district (he is the brother of Subramania Desikar, the Adinath leader of Thiruvaduthurai). The book, which was staged in the presence of Thirukurtalanadar, received the praise and prize of the then King of Madurai, Muthuvijaranga Sokkanatha Nayak.  Structure  The book manages to entertain as well as inform. Katiyankaran foretells the Thiruvala uprising of Courtallam. Thiruvala begins Three Tamils are strolling on Courtallam Nadar Road to chant the four verses. Women are getting up to see Courtallam Nadar Thiruvala. Vasanthavalli (storyteller) who was swinging the ball at that time is also coming to Thiruvalakkana. Vasanthavalli, who knows about the Lord through her friend, sends her friend in love with the Lord. In this case, the tagger is coming down the street. When the friend calls to tag her, the girl picks up on her native mountains and her career. Then Vasanthavalli looks at her hand and tells her the news of Courtallanadar's love and the (leader's) reputation of Courtalanathar. Her husband's leader is looking to see her. The two enjoy singing to the culprit to tell what happened to the leader who witnessed the crime. Thus ends the story  Features  Kuravansi Kuravansi is one of the most acclaimed texts and is still performed on stage today as a dance drama. Although he wrote Talapuranam, Malai, Siladai, Pillai Tamil, Yamakaanthadi etc. on the Trikutarasapakkavirayar Courtallam, his Kuravanchi is the only one that many people like to read today. Kutralakkuravansi got the name Thirukkuralakkuravansi because it was sung against the Lord. Filled with drama, the book is full of melodic and imaginative songs.  Period  One of the songs in the book states that Chinnanan Sathevan narrated the story of the passing away of the Pandya king Courtalanathar in the year 887 in Kollam. Kollam 824 + 887 = 1711 This book refers to the 18th century.

Argentina has weak protections for animals by international standards.  Regulations  Argentina's Law 14246 (1954) prohibits cruelty toward animals. This does not include harm caused by failure to act, and it is not clear which animals the law applies to. Regarding farm animals in particular, Argentina also has legislation on animal slaughter (Law 18819, published in 1970) and livestock transportation (the National Service of Health and Quality of Agricultural Food‚Äôs Resolution 97 of 1999). There are also a legislative framework on farm animal health, which provides for the creation of an Animal Health Police force, and policy literature on good practice. Law 18819 Article 1 stipulates that 'The slaughter of animals of the bovine, equine, sheep, swine and goat species that are slaughtered in slaughterhouses or refrigerators in the country must comply with the requirements and desensitisation procedures established by the Executive Power.' Law 14346 prohibits animal testing without qualified experimenters, demonstrable scientific interest, or the urgent need to undertake procedures on animals, and negligent conduct such as abandonment. Animals on a \\"superior evolutionary scale\\" are not to be used when using animals will yield the desired outcome. In 2014, Argentina received a D out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animals used for food  Between 2003 and 2012, Argentina's poultry production tripled and per capita consumption doubled. In 2012 Argentina was the ninth-largest poultry producer in the world and projected to become the fourth-largest in coming years. Argentina is projected to have a cattle inventory of 53.2 million animals in 2016, the highest level since 2008 when herds fell dramatically due to low returns and severe drought. Argentinian pork production rose by 40% from 2001 to 2011, when it had a swine herd of nearly 3.5 million head. De-beaking, de-toeing, tail-docking, tooth pulling, castration, and dehorning of livestock without anaesthetic are legal in Argentina, as is confinement in veal crates, gestation crates and battery cages.  Animals used in research  In June 2015, a bill to prohibit testing cosmetics on animals was introduced to the Argentine Senate.  Animal personhood  In 2014 an Argentine appeals court recognized the basic legal rights of an orangutan named Sandra who was born in a zoo. An advocacy group filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on Sandra's behalf, resulting in the court's declaration that the animal is a \\"non-human person\\".

It is crossed by two major rivers, the Nene and the Great Ouse. The main manufacturing area is Peterborough, and the foundation of the University of Cambridge in the thirteenth century made the county one of the country's most important intellectual centres. A large part of the county is in The Fens, and drainage of this habitat, which was probably commenced in the Roman period and largely completed by the seventeenth century, considerably increased the area available for agriculture. The administrative county was formed in 1974, incorporating most of the historic county of Huntingdonshire. Local government is divided between Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council, which is a separate unitary authority. Under the county council, there are five district councils, Cambridge City Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council, Huntingdonshire District Council and Fenland District Council. Local nature reserves (LNRs) are designated by local authorities, which must have legal control over the site, by owning it, leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest biologically, geologically or for education. Local authorities can either manage sites themselves or through other groups such as \\"friends of\\" and wildlife trusts, and can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs. There are twenty-seven LNRs in Cambridgeshire. Four are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and five are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The largest is Little Paxton Pits at sixty hectares, which is of national importance for wintering wildfowl, and the smallest is St Denis Churchyard, East Hatley, which has grassland with diverse flowers. There is public access to all sites.

Members of the group have appeared on various television shows, at award ceremonies, and political events to share their experiences losing a son or daughter to police violence and advocate for political change. The Mothers of the Movement started as a result of the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman after he fatally shot and killed teenager Trayvon Martin. The women have attended many conventions to spread awareness of the crisis that is police brutality in the United States. They are using their grief to rally involvement in communities and highlight the injustice they've endured with the loss of their children's lives. They also talk about life after loss, the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance), and how to move forward after a traumatic event.  Political activism   2016 Democratic National Convention  Seven women from the group‚ÄîGwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, mother of Dontre Hamilton; Lucy McBath, mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, mother of Michael Brown, Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, mother of Hadiya Pendleton; and Geneva Reed-Veal, mother of Sandra Bland‚Äîspoke in support of Clinton's candidacy for president during the July 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clinton had reached out privately the previous November to meet with the women. The Mothers of the Movement subsequently joined Clinton on the campaign trail to support her candidacy and advocate for an end to these killings. Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, did not join the other mothers in their endorsement of Hillary Clinton. She did not see an acceptable level of commitment against police brutality from any of the candidates and therefore withheld her endorsement. She did support the other mothers, saying in an interview with Fusion, \\"I hope they going to hold her accountable for whatever discussions they had behind closed doors.\\" The Mothers of the Movement have been criticized for being used by the Clinton campaign, but members deny this claim.  Women's March 2017  Mothers of the Movement accompanied singer and actress Janelle Mon√°e appearing at the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017 after the inauguration of President Donald Trump.  In the media  In August 2016, several members appeared with Beyonc√© at the Video Music Awards. Gwen Carr, Lezley McSpadden, and Sybrina Fulton had also appeared in the singer's short film \\"LEMONADE,\\" accompanying her 2016 album of the same name, holding photos of their slain sons. Women from the Mothers of the Movement group appeared on The Dr. Oz Show special episode entitled, \\"Healing America‚Äôs Grief: Mothers of The Movement And Mothers of Slain Officers Together For The First Time,\\" which appeared on air September 12, 2016. The show featured the mothers of victims of police violence as well as mothers of police officers killed by civilians. Guests of the show included Sybrina Fulton, Lucy McBath, Geneva Reed-Veal, Cleopatra Cowley, Maria Hamilton, Samara Rice, Lesley McSpadden, Wanda Johnson, Gwen Carr, Valerie Zamarripa, Paulette Thompson, and Nancy Renninger. Both groups spoke about losing a son or daughter to violence and as well as the difficulties of grieving in public. Additionally, Reed-Veal explained the need for more global conversations about racism and violence. Gwen Carr, Sybrina Fulton, and Lezley McSpadden spoke at the 2016 Triumph Awards, a joint venture by National Action Network and TV One to recognize distinguished individuals and corporations in civil rights, the arts, entertainment, education, business and sports who have made a positive impact on society by utilizing their talents and resources to help under-resourced communities.

Steinkopff, backed by Smith, formed the Apollinaris company in the UK to sell the water in 1873 or 1874. Smith later founded the Dictionary of National Biography. Steinkopff was chairman of the company during the period of its development, with Julius Prince as managing director. Apollinaris soon attained an un-paralleled position, becoming the leading natural table-water in the world. It was Otto von Bismarck's favourite mineral water.

St James's Gazette George Smith, Steinkopff's business partner in Apollinaris, was also the owner of the Pall Mall Gazette, a 'Jingoist' weekly journal. In 1880 he gave it to his new son-in-law, Henry Yates Thompson, who turned it into a radical Liberal paper. The editor, Frederick Greenwood, left with the entire editorial staff to found the St James's Gazette, backed by Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham.

The house had been previously owned by John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham. He was the younger brother of William Pitt the younger, who drew up the list of his first Cabinet in the library during Christmas 1783. Steinkopff rebuilt the house in 1891 and turned it into a \\"perfect store-house of the arts\\". The architects were Ernest George and Harold Peto. The latter was not at all impressed with Steinkopff and his wealth: returning from Cairo after his retirement in December 1892, Peto reflected in his travel diary: :\\"There is no fear of a wearisome amount of ease and delights, palling and cloying one's life; there are always sufficient setbacks and vexations one cannot escape to give piquancy (if it were lacking), without adding the drawbacks of living at the bottom of a horse pond and vainly trying to please vulgar, exacting, nouveau riches Steinkopffs & Co.\\" After his daughter Margaret's death, the art treasures in the house were sold at auction by Christie's, 22-24 May 1935; these included paintings, furniture, glass, porcelain, bronze sculptures, and silver.

Like other deep-sea octopuses, Bathypolypus arcticus do not have ink sacs. The mantle is globular, being nearly as wide as it is long. The surface of mantle, head, arms and web is covered in warts, especially around the eyes. The arms are short and in an irregular order with two rows of small suckers. Ecology Bathypolypus arcticus has low fecundity meaning that they lay fewer, relatively larger eggs than many other octopuses from which benthic young hatch. The female broods her eggs for over 400 days during which time it ceases to eat and slowly wastes away as it metabolises its own body to provide energy to guard the eggs and young. This was considered the longest brooding period for an octopus until surpassed by Graneledone boreopacifica. Robison, B.; B. Seibel; & J. Drazen (2014).

A wide range of other food items have been recorded in smaller quantities, including polychaetes, sipunculid worms, foraminiferas and bivalves. In captivity, adults have been housed together without showing the aggressive, cannibalistic tendencies known from several other octopuses. Bathypolypus arcticus have longer life spans than other octopuses where it is known and may live for six years or more. In comparison, many shallow water octopuses only live for a year. Higher water temperatures result in increased growth rates, but shorter life spans in Bathypolypus arcticus. Temperatures above are typically lethal to this cold- water species, although specimens have survived at if slowly acclimated.

It has a launch weight of , a power production capacity of 8.5 kW and a 15-year design life. Its payload is composed of Ku band and Ka band transponders. SKY Perfect JSAT Group plans to use JCSAT-16 as an in-orbit backup satellite for the Ku- and Ka-band satellites serving the Japanese market. SpaceX's Falcon 9 Flight 28 propelled JCSAT-16 to a geosynchronous transfer orbit on August 14, 2016. History In April 2014, SSL announced that it had been awarded a contract by SKY Perfect JSAT Group to manufacture two satellites: JCSAT-15 and JCSAT-16. The latter would be an 8.5 kW satellite with Ku band and Ka band payload for a broad range of orbital locations. It would be used as a back-up to the existing fleet. On September 10, 2014, JSAT announced that it had signed a launch service contract with SpaceX for the launch of JCSAT-16 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. On April 3, 2016, it was announced that Kratos had been selected for supplying a Ku-band antenna for JCSAT-16 TT&C; at its Superbird Platform West ground station. Also, it was stated that the satellite had passed the critical design review. On July 13, 2016, SSL delivered JCSAT-16 to the launch site in Cape Canaveral for launch processing and integration. This was the second launch of the year for JCSAT and also the second time the company used the SpaceX launch services, both times also happening in 2016. On August 4, 2016, JSAT announced that the expected launch date of JCSAT-16 was on August 14. First stage landed after successfully delivering JCSAT-16 At the scheduled August 14 at 05:26 UTC, SpaceX successfully launched the JCSAT-16 satellite into a 184 km √ó 35,912 km √ó 20.85¬∞ orbit on a Falcon 9 rocket. The first stage successfully landed afterwards. At 5:58 UTC, the satellite separated from the upper stage. The satellite manufacturer, SSL, announced that 33 minutes after launch, the satellite was in good health and sending signals. While JCSAT-16 was supposed to serve as on-orbit backup at the 124¬∞ East longitude position, it will be repositioned into service at the 162¬∞East position to replace Superbird-B2, a satellite past its design life. Originally Superbird-8 was supposed to replace Superbird-B2, but a mishap during transport to the launch site in March 2016 meant that it would be delayed between one and two years. On late September 2016, parts of Falcon 9 second stage reentered the atmosphere and landed over Java and Madura, Indonesia.

On October 19, 2016, HarmonQuest was renewed for a second season, but due to uncertainty around Seeso's future, rights to HarmonQuest were sold to Otter Media's VRV streaming service in June 2017. The second season premiered on VRV Select on September 15 and concluded on November 17, 2017. In October 2018, it was announced that VRV has renewed the show for a third season, which debuted on August 18, 2019. Season 1 (2016) Season 2 (2017) Season 3 (2019) Production Development Prior to the creation of HarmonQuest, Harmon had included a Dungeons & Dragons-style segment, hosted by Crittenden, at the end of the weekly podcast Harmontown. When Harmon pitched the idea of HarmonQuest, which was originally conceived as a low-budget online show, NBC Universal executive vice-president of digital enterprises Evan Shapiro became interested in the idea. When Seeso was developed as an NBC- owned comedy channel, an order for ten episodes of HarmonQuest was confirmed. The show is produced by Universal Cable Productions and Starburns Industries. Filming and animation The show is recorded in front of a live audience at Victory Studios in Glendale, California, with parts of the stories being animated later. Filming typically takes place over an hour, which is then edited down to the 25-minute runtime. Harmon has cited The Ricky Gervais Show as an influence, as it also features a mix of live and animated footage. Reception The series has been likened to Critical Role, a web series streaming on Twitch and later uploaded to the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel since 2015. Unlike Critical Role episodes which are long-form, full-play D&D; podcasts often exceeding 4hrs, HarmonQuest has been praised for its accessibility towards casual and beginner audiences. Javon Phillips of the LA Times said, \\"The show makes its ventures a lot less time-consuming and ups the watchability quotient by throwing in animated segments in digestible half-hour episodes. Gamemaster Spencer Crittenden approaches the show as just that ‚Äî a show. It‚Äôs not just players playing the game and showing off their multi-sided dice-rolling skills.\\" See also * Critical Role * The Adventure Zone References External links 2016 web series debuts American adult animated comedy television series American adult animated web series American comedy web series English-language television shows Seeso original programming American television series with live action and animation Television series created by Dan Harmon ","title":"HarmonQuest"},{"id":"51172003","text":"Palace in Obroshyne J√≥zef Fontana II (born 1676 in Mendrisio, Canton of Ticino, died 1739 in Warsaw) was a Swiss Italian Polish architect and the father of architects, Jakub Fontana and Jan Kanty Fontana.

Biography After Enon ceased to be an ongoing recording and touring concern in 2011, Yasuda made the first recordings for what would become Plvs Vltra's debut album, Parthenon. The sessions included collaborations with Enon's John Schmersal, who produced the album, as well as with friends Danny Ray Thompson of the Sun Ra Arkestra, Scott Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now, and Thomas Keville of Man Man. Yasuda spent much of 2011 mostly keeping to herself and \\"compiling unfinished tracks\\" before she \\"decided to wrap them up by making deadlines.\\" The opening track, \\"Flowers To Bees,\\" was featured in Tiny Mix Tapes' Chocolate Grinder section. Yasuda collaborated with Scott Allen on the song, finishing a backing track Allen had created. Danny Ray Thompson played baritone sax, flute and contributed percussion, adding \\"emotions to these electronic tunes,\\" according to Yasuda. The title track includes a sample from a \\"storybook vinyl album\\" Yasuda found at a thrift store. Parthenon was released in 2012 on Austrian experimental label Spectrum Spools/Editions Mego. \\"As if Alice Coltrane's Universal Consciousness was...sent into the future to be reimagined as an electronic pop record...Parthenon refuses to be pinned down,\\" enthused Spectrum's biography. SPIN rated Parthenon 7 out of 10 stars, citing its fusion of Kylie Minogue and Boredoms influences. Resident Advisor rated the album 3.5 of 5 stars, calling the record an \\"addictive jumble...a confusingly infectious record\\" with catchy hooks but puzzling lyrics. Tiny Mix Tapes called Parthenon a \\"straight-up pop album with alluring (because ‚Äúsexy‚Äù sounds misogynist and creepy) female vocals.\\" The Quietus said Yasuda's songs are \\"equivalent to playing Twister in order to lose, turning in on themselves the very game-logics of popular sounds and structures.\\" Yasuda quickly followed that release with a second album, Yo-Yo Blue, on the Field Hymns cassette-only label in 2013. Though the album was limited to 100 physical copies, Yo-Yo Blue was also released digitally via Bandcamp. Field Hymns described the album to a \\"thumbed-through flip book of vaporous, hazy memories...replete with childhood recitals, fragments of half-remembered stanzas and sumptuous j-pop interludes.\\" Cassette Love said the mostly instrumental album \\"has the mood of a dream, floating above and observing a variety of scenes; detached, yet focused\\" and singled out the vocal performances on ‚Äú„Å°„Çá-„Å°„Çá (with Nico)‚Äù and ‚ÄúFalling Slowly‚Äù as \\"worthy of being featured on a single all by themselves.\\" Later that year Yasuda released a 7\\" single, \\"Rooftop Arcade\\" b/w \\"Mesopotamia\\" on Columbus-based Scioto Records. Schmersal and Yasuda produced both songs, which were primarily composed on an Akai MPC4000 sampler. Equipment Yasuda plays hardware synths including a Minimoog Voyager, Nord Lead 2 and Casio SK-1 to sample and play melodies, along with some effects including Kaoss Pad and reverb. She typically makes beats using an Akai MPC4000 and Ableton Live software. \\"[Schmersal] and I also ran lots of signals through various hardware components as we were mixing,\\" Yasuda told Tiny Mix Tapes. \\"Old mic [pre-amps]...mixers, compressors, and effects boxes.\\" Yasuda also uses a Tascam 424 cassette four-track to send signals to and from the digital realm. \\"That‚Äôs my effort to create a little more organic sounding tracks,\\" Yasuda said in an interview with the Left Turn 4 Records zine. Touring From 2011-2014 Yasuda toured with St. Vincent playing synth. She has performed a limited number of live shows as Plvs Vltra, but feels that her one-woman shows lack the stage presence of her other musical projects. \\"I feel like me standing alone on stage with musical toys might not be captivating enough,\\" Yasuda told Left Turn 4 Records in 2013, \\"I feel bad for these people who are watching me pressing buttons on stage by myself.\\" Discography Albums *2012 Parthenon CD and LP (Spectrum Spools/Editions Mego) *2013 Yo-Yo Blue cassette and digital release (Field Hymns/Bandcamp) Singles *2013 '\\"Rooftop Arcade\\" / \\"Mesopotamia\\" 7\\" (Scioto Records) Compilation appearances *2013 \\"Mizu\\" on \\"Mixtape: Summer 2013\\" cassette and digital release (LT4/Bandcamp) See also *Enon References * http://www.allmusic.com/artist/plvs-vltra-mn0002935215 External links *Plvs Vltra Bandcamp page *Plvs Vltra Soundcloud page Art rock musical groups Musical groups established in 2012 Indie pop groups from Los Angeles Indie rock musical groups from California ","title":"Plvs Vltra"},{"id":"51172085","text":"Sz√©cs√©nke is a village in N√≥gr√°d County, Northern Hungary Region, Hungary.

The company is based in Seattle, Washington, United States, and has 750,000 total employees.  Headquarters  Amazon's former headquarters in the Pacific Medical Center building in Beacon Hill, Seattle Amazon's global headquarters are in more than 40 owned and leased buildings spread across Seattle's adjacent South Lake Union, Denny Triangle, and Downtown neighborhoods. The first 14 buildings Amazon occupied in South Lake Union were developed primarily by Vulcan, Inc. from 2008 onward, the first 11 of which were acquired from Vulcan in 2012 at a cost of $1.16 billion. The company was previously headquartered in rented space within the Pacific Medical Center, located in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood, from 1998 to 2011. Amazon is currently building a new four tower, four low-rise, complex in Seattle's Denny Triangle neighborhood to serve as the primary headquarters, though it will retain many of the earlier purchased buildings to house its more than 45,000 corporate employees in the Seattle area. The plan for the new campus, designed by NBBJ and named \\"Rufus 2.0\\" after a dog who was part of the company in its early days, was approved by the city of Seattle in 2012 and construction began the year after. The first of the towers, nicknamed Doppler, opened on December 14, 2015. Other major campuses The European headquarters are in Luxembourg's capital, Luxembourg City. On November 13, 2018, Amazon announced that it would divide the planned HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia. On February 14, 2019, Amazon canceled its plan for the HQ2 location in New York City. Amazon is also in the process of building a retail hub of operations center in Nashville, Tennessee. On August 21, 2019, Amazon opened its largest campus in the world at Nanakramguda in Hyderabad, India. It is the first Amazon-owned campus located outside the United States and features the single largest Amazon-owned building in the world. The 9.5 acre campus houses over 15,000 employees. Amazon plans to build a major campus in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, that will host 15,000 employees by 2025. The company opened its first Bellevue office in 2017, marking a return to the city since the company was founded there in 1995. The Bellevue campus will include the 43-story Bellevue 600 tower, which is planned to be the tallest building in the city and the tallest to be developed by Amazon.  Software development centers  While much of Amazon's software development occurs in Seattle, the company employs software developers in centers across the globe. Some of these sites are run by an Amazon subsidiary called A2Z Development. * North America ** United States *** Austin, TX *** Cambridge, MA *** Cupertino, CA *** Detroit, MI *** Gurnee, IL *** Herndon, VA *** Irvine, CA *** Minneapolis, MN *** New York, NY (Manhattan West, Herald Square, Fifth Avenue) *** Pittsburgh, PA *** San Francisco, CA *** San Luis Obispo, CA *** Seattle, WA *** Tempe, AZ ** Canada *** Vancouver, BC *** Toronto, ON *Central America **Costa Rica * Europe ** Austria ***Graz ** Germany ***Berlin ***Dresden ***Aachenhttps://www.amazon.jobs/es/landing_pages/amazon-aachen-development- center ** Ireland ***Dublin ** Poland ***Gda≈Ñsk ** Romania *** Bucharest *** Ia»ôi ** Spain ***Madrid ***Barcelonahttps://www.aboutamazon.eu/press- release/amazon-to-open-a-new-research-and-development-centre-in-barcelona- focused-on-machine-learning ** United Kingdom ***Cambridge ***Edinburgh ***London * Asia **Israel ***Tel Aviv ***Haifa **India ***Bangalore ***Hyderabad ***New Delhi ***Chennai * Africa ** South Africa *** Cape Town  Customer service centers  Customer Service Center in Huntington, West Virginia * Africa ** South Africa *** Cape TownAmazon chooses 1stream call center solutions for South Africa , Retrieved, February 1, 2012. * Europe ** United Kingdom *** Edinburgh ** Ireland *** Cork * Central America ** Costa Rica *** San Jose * South America ** Colombia *** Bogot√° * North America ** Grand Forks, North Dakota ** Huntington, West Virginia ** Kennewick, Washington ** Winchester, Kentucky (LEX11)  Retail  Below is a list of Amazon's retail locations, as of October 2018.

The US locations have large sets of Amazon Lockers and an area for customers to make returns. The India locations are in existing retailers and have customers wait for a store employee to retrieve their package. The company also operates 33 Treasure Trucks in the United States and United Kingdom, which serve as pick- up points for one deal per day that customers can order using the Amazon app.  Fulfillment and warehousing  Amazon fulfillment centers are large facilities with hundreds of employees, sometimes thousands. Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand- held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. A picker may walk 10 or more miles a day. In newer fulfillment centers, items are stored on pods and brought to pickers by robots (Amazon Robotics). In the United Kingdom initial staffing was provided by Randstad Holding and other temporary employment agencies. In the United States, many workers are hired as Amazon employees and granted shares of stock or sign-on bonuses, while others are offered temporary seasonal positions. \\"When we have permanent positions available, we look to the top performing temporary associates to fill them,\\" said an Amazon spokesperson. Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a warehouse automation company, in 2012. Amazon fulfillment centers can also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers, for an extra fee.Fulfillment by Amazon from the company's website Third-party sellers can use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ship for other platforms as well, such as eBay or their own websites.[FBA - Multi- Channel Fulfillment FBM or FBA] Retrieved April 16, 2015. On March 20, 2020, Amazon agreed to remove metal detectors from its warehouses after a warehouse worker tested positive for COVID-19 In addition to removing metal detectors, Amazon also agreed to enact a \\"6 feet rule,\\" which will enforce a six-feet distance between warehouse employees. North America =United States= Fulfillment centers are located in the following cities and are often named after an International Air Transport Association airport code (Fulfillment Center Codes). Sortation centers are regional warehouses where Amazon packages are sorted to a last mile carrier, typically either Amazon Logistics or the United States Postal Service.

Retail goods  Amazon product lines include several media (books, DVDs, music CDs, videotapes, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal- care items, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry and watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items and toys/games. The company launched amazon.com Auctions, a web auctions service, in March 1999. However, it failed to chip away at the large market share of the industry pioneer, eBay. Later, the company launched a fixed-price marketplace business, zShops, in September 1999, and the now defunct partnership with Sotheby's, called Sothebys.amazon.com, in November. Auctions and zShops evolved into Amazon Marketplace, a service launched in November 2000 that let customers sell used books, CDs, DVDs, and other products alongside new items. , Amazon Marketplace is the largest of its kind, followed by similar marketplaces from Sears, Rakuten, and Newegg. In August 2007, Amazon announced AmazonFresh, a grocery service offering perishable and nonperishable foods. Customers could have orders delivered to their homes at dawn or during a specified daytime window. Delivery was initially restricted to residents of Mercer Island, Washington, and was later expanded to several ZIP codes in Seattle proper.Arrington, Michael (August 1, 2007). \\"Remember Webvan? So Does Amazon\\" . TechCrunch. AmazonFresh also operated pick-up locations in the suburbs of Bellevue and Kirkland from summer 2007 through early 2008. In 2012, Amazon announced the launch of Vine.com for buying green products, including groceries, household items, and apparel. It is part of Quidsi, the company that Amazon bought in 2010 that also runs the sites Diapers.com (baby), Wag.com (pets), and YoYo.com (toys). Amazon also owns other e-commerce sites like Shopbop.com, Woot.com, and Zappos.com. Amazon's Subscribe & Save program offers a discounted price on an item (usually sold in bulk), free shipping on every Subscribe & Save shipment, and automatic shipment of the item every one, two, three, or six months. In 2013, Amazon launched its site in India, Amazon.in. It started with electronic goods. In July 2014, Amazon said it would invest $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) in India to expand business, after its largest Indian rival Flipkart announced $1 billion in funding. In 2014, Amazon sold 63% of all books bought online and 40% of all books sold overall. In 2015, a study by Survata found that 44% of respondents searching for products went directly to Amazon.com. On September 30, 2015 Amazon announced the launch of Merch by Amazon, a service intended to help content creators generate revenue through the sale of branded T-shirts and other merchandise items such as long sleeve shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies and PopSockets grips, designed by creators and sold, produced and fulfilled by Amazon.https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx3504078FRYE5I/Announcing- Merch-by-Amazon-A-New-Way-to-Generate-Revenue-with-Branded-T-Shirts Since the summer of 2018, the service has also been available on the European marketplaces in Germany and Great Britain.https://merchreport.de/was-ist- merch-by-amazon In October 2015, Amazon announced a new handmade marketplace called Handmade By Amazon, already having 5,000 sellers from 60 countries and 80,000 items for sale. The platform is designed for artisans to sell their good directly to the public, similar to the platform Etsy. Amazon Prime 200x200px In 2005, Amazon announced the creation of Amazon Prime, a membership offering free two-day shipping within the contiguous United States on all eligible purchases for a flat annual fee of $79 (), as well as discounted one- day shipping rates. Amazon launched the program in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom in 2007; in France (as \\"Amazon Premium\\") in 2008, in Italy in 2011, in Canada in 2013, and in India on July 26, 2016. Amazon Prime membership in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, and the United States also provides Amazon Video, the instant streaming of selected movies and TV shows at no additional cost.

The film stars Michael Shannon, Veronica Ferres, and Gael Garc√≠a Bernal. It tells the story about a hostage-taking situation set against an ecological disaster in Bolivia. It had its premiere at the Shanghai International Film Festival. It was selected to be screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Three scientists (Dr. Laura Sommerfield, Dr. Fabio Cavani, and Dr. Arnold Meir) are sent to South America as part of a U.N. investigation into an ecological disaster of Salar de Uyuni. In the past, two rivers had been diverted for irrigation, but the effort failed, and the result was an ever growing toxic salt flat. Upon landing, all three are kidnapped by the man who had become CEO (played by Michael Shannon) of the large international consortium held responsible for the ecological disaster. He seems both tormented by the disaster and uncertain of its significance in the larger scheme of things‚Äîfor the nearby supervolcano, Uturunku, has begun to show a ground-lift in the areas around it, which may or may not be signs of an eruption in our time (if such a thing were to happen, and depending on the degree of the eruption, it could be a worldwide cataclysmic event). The two male scientists are given food that induces extreme digestive distress to keep them out of the way. Meanwhile, Laura is taken to the middle of the salt flat and stranded near a rocky outcropping with two nearly blind children named Huascar and Atahualpa, the names of the last two pre-Columbian rulers of the Incan Empire, whose last independent acts were to go to war against each other. The three have been provided with enough food and water for a week, but it is uncertain whether or not they have been stranded for good. Instead of trying to convince Dr. Sommerfield not to publish by argument, the CEO has staged the kidnapping and stranding of Sommerfield and the children with hope that it will drive home the emotional costs associated with the disaster, and that it would get her to publish a report that goes beyond statistics and figures. Later, the CEO reveals that the two children are his adoptive sons, and that their blindness is due to the disaster wrought by the CEO's own Consortium. Dr. Sommerfield is then given a first-class ticket to Rome, to visit the Santissima Trinit√† dei Monti convent (at the top of the Spanish Steps), which the CEO had always wanted to see, in order to view its cloister, which features an anamorphic fresco of Saint Francis of Paula praying under a tree. She urges the CEO to come with her instead of turning himself in, but he says he would be caught anyway.

At its prime, Winfield included three saloons, three stores, a post office, two hotels, a boarding house, mill, smelter, concentrator, church and a school, which is now a museum containing school furnishings and displays. This museum is restored and operated by the Clear Creek Historical Society of Chaffee County. The Ball cabin across the street from the school house is also a museum of the mining era.

She also attended the Opernstudio of the Bavarian State Opera, and took master classes with Hans Hotter, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Brigitte Fassbaender and Peter Schreier. She was a member of the Theater Basel from 1990, and from 1992 to 1995 worked at the Theater Dortmund, where she learned many lyrical mezzo- soprano parts. She appeared as Tamiri in Mozart's Il re pastore at the Nederlandse Opera Amsterdam, as Virtu in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea at the Salzburg Festival, as Fenena in Verdi's Nabucco at the Bregenz Festival and as Flora in Verdi's La traviata at the Zurich Festival. She turned to the works of Wagner in the 1994/95 season, performing Fricka and Waltraute in the Dortmund Ring cycle. From 1995 to 1997 at the Staatstheater Braunschweig, she appeared as Brang√§ne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Judith in Bartok's Herzog Blaubarts Burg, Marie in Alban Berg's Wozzeck and Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlos. She changed to singing soprano in 2012. She was awarded two Grammy awards in 2002 for singing Cassandre in Les Troyens by Berlioz in a 2000 live recording of the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Colin Davis.  Bayreuth  Lang performed at the Bayreuth Festival first in 2005 the part of Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde. In 2011 she appeared as Ortrud in Lohengrin, staged by Hans Neuenfels. In 2016, she took over the role of Isolde in the production by Katharina Wagner conducted by Christian Thielemann. A reviewer noted her \\"floating dark cantilenas\\" (\\"mit schwebenden, dunklen Kantilenen\\"). Eleonore B√ºning wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that she, as the young Irish bride delivered to Marke, expresses her desperation forcefully (headline: \\"Wie wuchtig die junge Braut ihre Verzweiflung herausschleudert!\\").  Concert  Lang recorded alto parts in Advent cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach with John Eliot Gardiner in 1992. She sang the solo in Mahler's Third Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall on 12 December 2007 with the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra, conducted by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky. A review noted her \\"haunting, intense, totally engrossing 'O Mensch, gib Acht!'\\", with \\"immaculate phrasing\\". She performed the work again in Freiburg with the SWR Orchestra in 2016.

From 2000 to 2002 he was chair of a commission dealing with projected sound norms at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, from which he resigned after feeling the commission's independence was undermined by the Ministry for Transport and Water Management. In 2019, Berkhout co-founded the climate sceptic organization Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL). Career Berkhout was born in 1940 in Den Helder.Augustinus Johannes Berkhout, Minimum Phase in Sampled-Signal Theory\\", PhD Dissertation, Delft University of Technology, February 1970 He studied electrical engineering at Delft University of Technology and obtained his degree in 1963. In 1970 he obtained a PhD cum laude in physics from the same university. In 1964 Berkhout started working for Royal Dutch Shell. In 1976 he returned to Delft University of Technology, and became a professor of acoustic imaging and sound control. In 1987 he also became professor of geophysics. In 1998 he joined the board of the university, he stepped down in 2001, before the end of his term, due to differences with other board members in vision on the future of the university. In 2001 he became professor of innovation management and he retired from the university in 2007. Berkhout has pleaded against the increase of bureaucratic processes at universities. During his time at Delft University Berkhout was the founder and scientific director of the Delphi Consortium, which does seismic research for a consortium of oil and gas companies. Public sector Berkhout was chair of the independent Commission Experts Airplanesound from mid 2000 to December 2002. On request of the House of Representatives the Dutch Minister for Transport and Water Management, Tineke Netelenbos, instigated the commission. The commission was to look into the sound norms for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for the upcoming five years. Berkhout resigned as chair after having the feeling that the independence of the commission was hindered by the Ministry, and having to wait for approval of a measurement plan for over half a year. The whole commission resigned, citing they had been actively worked against by the Ministry. For the 2006 Dutch general elections Berkhout had planned to form a new party with several scientists and entrepreneurs, but did not enter the elections, seeing the huge increase in new parties contesting the election.  Climate Intelligence Foundation  Berkhout founded the Netherlands-based organization Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL). Mid 2019 plans of CLINTEL and Berkhout were leaked showing that they were organizing a campaign against political commitments to net zero carbon emissions being made into law. The campaign features a number of academics and industry figures with ties to climate change denial groups, as well as members from oil and gas companies.Hundreds of climate sceptics to mount international campaign to stop net-zero targets being made law In: The Independent. 6 September 2019. Retrieved 7 September 2019. Berkhout claimed the ideal of the organization was to provide an alternative to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In late September 2019 the group produced an open letter which stated that there was no climate emergency and repeated a number of claims that were inconsistent with the scientific evidence on climate. A fact check performed by climate scientists for Climate Feedback gave the letter an overall scientific credibility of \\"very low\\", and tagged it as \\"Biased, Cherry-picking, Inaccurate, Misleading\\".

Historically, the arcade catered toward competitive fighting games. The original arcade opened in 1944 and closed in February 2011, but reopened in May 2012 under different management. Chinatown Fair has been widely regarded as New York City's \\"last great arcade\\".  History  Chinatown Fair opened in 1944, taking over the first floor of the popular Port Arthur Chinese Restaurant building located at 7-9 Mott Street in New York City; previously, the first floor had been occupied by Soy Kee & Co., exporters, as well as the Eastern Trading Company. Chinatown Fair operated as a penny arcade and small museum for many years, before becoming a video game arcade in the 1970s. Indian immigrant Sam Palmer purchased the business in 1982 after having a \\"religious vision\\". One of its first attractions was a dancing chicken. The dancing chicken was later replaced with a tic-tac-toe playing chicken, which was retired in the early 2000s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the arcade hosted many retro generation games including Pac-Man and Space Invaders. In 1991, after the release of Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, Chinatown Fair switched focus to competitive fighting games. By the late 1990s Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, The King of Fighters, Soulcalibur, Tekken and other fighting games were commonly played. Top players such as Justin Wong, NYChrisG, Michael \\"Yipes\\" Mendoza, and Sanford Kelly frequented the establishment. As of 2010, The New York Times wrote that Chinatown Fair was among the last video arcades in the city. Video arcades have been in decline with the rise of home video games. The newspaper reported that it became \\"a center for all the outcasts in the city to bond over their shared love\\" of classic arcade and fighting video games no longer popular in modern arcades, with titles including the original Street Fighter II (1991), The King of Fighters (1994), and Ms. Pac-Man. Other groups congregated around Dance Dance Revolution machines and racing games. Unlike the norm at other arcades, where winning players continue until deposed, Chinatown Fair players play a maximum of three or four continuous games. In February 2011, Chinatown Fair closed down. On May 5, 2012 over a year later it reopened under a new name \\"Chinatown Fair Family Fun Center\\" with new manager and part owner, Lonnie Sobel. Former competitive players criticized the new arcade for catering toward casual players, with the new ownership explaining that they were targeting a new clientele. Competitive fighting game players relocated to Next Level, a Brooklyn arcade owned by Chinatown Fair's former manager, which opened in 2011. The arcade is the focus of the 2015 documentary, The Lost Arcade, which was released in New York City on August 12, 2016.

Life The son of John Gandy of South Brent, Devon, he was born on 14 October 1649; his father was a priest of the Church of England who had been deprived of his living during the English Civil War. He entered Merchant Taylors' School in 1663, and went on to Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 15 March 1667. He graduated B.A. 17 October 1670, M.A. in 1674, and was elected Fellow on 30 November 1670. He served as a proctor, elected 18 April 1683. Gandy was senior fellow of Oriel when he was deprived for refusing the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II, in 1690. As a nonjuror he was a leading if anonymous controversialist; and advocated for maintaining the schism in the Church of England, when Thomas Ken, the sole survivor of the original deprived bishops, in 1710 expressed a wish that the breach should be closed. At that point Henry Dodwell, Robert Nelson and Francis Brokesby returned to the Anglican fold. In 1716 Gandy was consecrated bishop by Jeremy Collier, Nathaniel Spinckes, and Samuel Hawes (died 1722). When the divisive issue of \\"usages\\" arose in 1717, he left Collier's party, and followed Spinckes in staying close to Anglican ritual. In 1720 he joined Spinckes and Hawes in consecrating Hilkiah Bedford and Ralph Taylor (who was to return to the Church of England); on 11 June 1725 he assisted in consecrating John Blackbourne; and in 1726, in consecrating Henry Hall. on 25 March 1728. He presided at the consecration of Richard Rawlinson, and in the same year at that of George Smith (1693‚Äì1756). Gandy died in Scroop's Court, Holborn, the location of his chapel, on 26 February 1734, and was buried in St Pancras churchyard. He left a wife Ann and daughter Anne. His congregation at Scroop's Court passed to Richard Rawlinson and Robert Gordon or Gordoun. Works Gandy's publications included: * A Letter in Vindication of the Answer to the Queries concerning Schism and Toleration, 1701, (anon.) * Old England ... the Government of England . . . hereditary, 1705 (anon.) * Jure Divino: or an Answer to all ...

His name has been proposed as incorporating the earliest recorded instance of the English swear word fuck. Roger Fuckebythenavele is mentioned seven times (with minor variations in spelling) in the plea rolls of the Chester County Court for the years 1310‚Äì1311. The \\"serjeants of the peace\\" had been ordered to arrest Roger and produce him before the court, but they had failed to find him, in consequence of which he was outlawed. In 2015, the historian Paul Booth drew attention to Fuckebythenavele's \\"opprobrious nickname\\". Booth argues that \\"there can be no doubt\\" that the element fuck in his name \\"has the sexual connotation\\". He suggests that either Roger was a man who had tried, through ignorance, to have sexual intercourse through his partner's navel (or believed that this was the correct way to copulate); or that he had engaged in frottage, rubbing his penis against his partner's navel, possibly in order to avoid conception. Booth contends that this is the earliest recorded instance of the word fuck in English.  Other early occurrences of the word  There are several other contenders for the earliest instance of the word in the English language. For example, a Bristol charter from 1373 makes mention of a wood called Fockynggroue. Various medieval manuscripts mention individuals with personal names that can also be interpreted as containing some of the earliest instances of the word fuck. None of these names have conclusively been proven to be unambiguous occurrences of the word.Wordsworth, Dot (26 Sep. 2015). \\"The remarkable discovery of Roger Fuckebythenavele.\\" The Spectator.

While this epithet originally derives from the innocuous Old Icelandic word fj√∫ka (\\"tossed by the wind\\"), it has been suggested by The Spectator that this word was used in a derogatory manner here: several later English writers, such as George Chapman, used this word as an insult.

It orbits within the outer part of its star's habitable zone, at a distance of 1.01 AU. The exoplanet was found by using the radial velocity method, from radial-velocity measurements via observation of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the planet's parent star.  Characteristics  Mass, radius and temperature HIP 57274 d is a gas giant, a planet that has a radius and mass close to that of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. It has a temperature of . It has an estimated mass of around 0.527 (167 ), and a potential radius of around 9 based on its mass, since it is slightly more massive than Saturn. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named HIP 57274, orbited by a total of three planets. The star has a mass of 0.73 and a radius of 0.68 . It has a surface temperature of 4640 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 8.96. Therefore, HIP 57274 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, but can be seen with good binoculars.  Orbit  HIP 57274 d orbits its star every 432 days at a distance of 1.01 AU. This is very similar to that of Earth's orbital period and distance.  Habitability  HIP 57274 d resides in the outer part of circumstellar habitable zone of the parent star. The exoplanet, with a mass of 0.527 , is too massive to be rocky, and because of this the planet itself may not be habitable. Hypothetically, large enough moons, with a sufficient atmosphere and pressure, may be able to support liquid water and potentially life. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of HIP 57274 d, the moon's orbit would have to be roughly 40 days to support a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. To support an Earth-like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from sputtering is for the moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts. NASA's Galileo's measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 .

Family and background Goring was born in 1679, fourth son of Captain Henry Goring (died 1685) of Wappingthorne, Sussex, and his second wife Mary, daughter of Sir John Covert, 1st Baronet, of Slaugham, Sussex. He married in 1714 Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Matthew, of Twickenham, Middlesex, and by her had nine sons and two daughters. He succeeded his half-brother Charles to the baronetcy and to Wappingthorn estate in Steyning, Sussex in 1714. Military and political career Goring was commissioned Captain in Colonel Edmund Soames's regiment of foot in 1705, before transferring in 1707 to a regiment of horse commanded by Samuel Masham, who was a favourite of the then monarch, Queen Anne. In 1711 he became Colonel of the 31st Regiment of Foot before going on half-pay in 1713. As a Jacobite he was one of a number of British army officers forced to sell their commissions during the time of the Jacobite Rising of 1715. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of Great Britain for Steyning 1 February 1709 ‚Äì 1715, and for Horsham 4 April 1707 ‚Äì 1708 and 26 January ‚Äì 16 June 1715, but was unseated by petition of his opponent. Role in Atterbury Plot Goring, who stood (unsuccessfully as turned out) in the 1722 general election as MP for his old seat of Steyning, wrote to the Pretender James Francis Edward Stuart on 20 March 1721 a letter in which he put forward a plan for a restoration of the Stuart monarchy with the assistance of an invasion by Irish exile troops commanded by the Duke of Ormonde from Spain and Lieutenant-General Dillon from France. The plot collapsed in England in the spring of 1722, at the time of the death of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, who a year before had been forced to resign as First Lord of the Treasury. He died on 19 April, when the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France, made it known to Carteret, Robert Walpole's Secretary of State for the Southern Department, that the Jacobites had asked him to send 3,000 men in support of a coup d'√©tat to take place early in May. The French said they had refused permission for the Duke of Ormonde to march a force across France to a channel port and they had also moved their Irish Brigade away from Dunkirk. Sunderland's papers were seized, and a letter of thanks addressed to him by the Pretender came to light. In England, insufficient money had been collected by the Jacobites to provide enough arms to support a rising, leading the Jacobite exile leader the Earl of Mar (writing in March 1722) to comment on hearing this that Goring, \\"though a honest, stout, man, had not showed himself very fit for things of this kind.\\" Walpole's agents began the search for evidence against the leading suspects of Jacobitism, but they found little. Despite this, Walpole gave orders for several men to be arrested including Goring as well as Bishop Atterbury. The latter was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Goring, meanwhile, avoided arrest and had fled the country on 23 August; he remained in France until his death in 1731. In his absence, at a trial where he was considered one of the major managers of the plot, his agent stated Goring had attempted to enlist a gang of one thousand brandy smugglers to assist the projected invasion. This led to some government action against such smuggling. He was created Viscount Goring and Baron Bullinghel in the Jacobite Peerage after going into exile in France in 1722. He died in 1731, still in exile, at age 52.

She is known for her research on rooibos, a herbal tea popular in South Africa, has been funded by the South African Rooibos Council in her research, and is frequently quoted in South African media promoting the reported health benefits of rooibos.  Education and career  Swart completed her MSc in Biology in 1986 and her doctorate at Stellenbosch in 1999, and returned to Stellenbosch as a faculty member in 2002, where she teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses in biochemistry. She was instrumental in establishing the P450 Steroid Research Group at Stellenbosch and in 2011 she was appointed associate professor. Her research areas include: Adrenal steroidogenesis, cytochrome P450 enzymes, prostate cancer, and products derived from the plants Aspalatus linearis (Rooibos), Salsola tuberculatiformis Botch. (Gannabos) and Sutherlandia frutescens (Cancer bush).  Research  Her primary research focus, and that of the P450 Steroid Research Group, is on the hormones (adrenal steroids) produced by the adrenal gland as well as on the steroidogenic enzymes which catalyse their biosynthesis, the metabolism of these steroids in prostate cancer, and their implications in endocrine disorders. Their research also involves the investigation of the effects of plant products on the endocrine system. Swart's research has been sponsored by the National Research Foundation, Cancer Association of South Africa and the SA Rooibos Council. The research is broken into three focus areas:  11Œ≤-hydroxyandrostenedione  11Œ≤-hydroxyandrostenedione is an adrenal steroid and has been implicated in prostate cancer as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer. Swart investigates the mechanism of this steroid within prostate cancer cells and other cancer cells.  Rooibos  There are two avenues of research regarding rooibos that Swart is pursuing. = Prostate cancer metabolism = Swart's research has suggested that rooibos may have beneficial effects on prostate cancer by inhibiting 17Œ≤-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and blocking dihydrotestosterone. Her research is also looking at the effect of rooibos on the PSA enzyme marker which is used as a test for prostate cancer. = Cortisol and stress = Her research has suggested that drinking rooibos may lower stress through the effects of two compounds in it, aspalathin and nothofagin. Under laboratory conditions these compounds block the production of a stress hormone, cortisol. She has claimed that rooibos has the potential to prevent heart disease, reduce the effects of aging, and promote weight loss.

He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Arizona. Professional career The Denver Broncos selected Parks in the sixth round (219th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 17th safety selected in 2016 and the second safety drafted by the Broncos, after third-round draft pick Justin Simmons. Denver Broncos =2016= On May 13, 2016, the Denver Broncos signed Parks to a four-year, $2.44 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $100,356. Throughout training camp, Parks competed with veteran Shiloh Keo for the backup strong safety role. Head coach Gary Kubiak named Parks the backup strong safety behind T. J. Ward to start the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Denver Broncos' season-opening 21-20 victory over the Carolina Panthers. In Week 3, he made two solo tackles, two pass deflections, and had his first career interception off a pass by Andy Dalton during a 29-17 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals. On November 13, 2016, Parks recovered a blocked field goal during the New Orleans Saints' extra point and returned it for the game-winning two point score after teammate Justin Simmons leaped over the offensive line and blocked Wil Lutz's attempt to defeat the Saints 25‚Äì23 in the final 1:30 seconds. The play was challenged by the Saints after it appeared Parks may have stepped out of bounds during the return, but the ruling was upheld after it was determined there was not enough conclusive evidence showing Parks had stepped out of bounds. Parks finished his rookie season with 22 combined tackles (17 solo), four pass deflections, a fumble recovery, one interception, and a touchdown in 16 games and zero starts while appearing on special teams and as a reserve safety on defense. The Denver Broncos finished third in the season AFC West with a 9-7 record and head coach Gary Kubiak retired due to health concerns. =2017= The Denver Broncos hired Vance Joseph as their new head coach and Joe Woods as their new defensive coordinator, replacing Wade Phillips.

In Week 15, he started at strong safety after Simmons had been placed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain. Parks went on to make a season-high seven combined tackles in their 25-13 win at the Indianapolis Colts. The following week, he collected two combined tackles, defended a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Kirk Cousins in the Bronco's 27-11 loss at the Washington Redskins. Parks finished the 2017 season with 51 combined tackles (36 solo), four pass deflections, and an interception in 16 games and four starts. He started three games at strong safety and appeared on special teams and as an extra defensive back during dime packages. In their first season under head coach Vance Joseph, the Denver Broncos finished last in their division with a 5-11 record.

The venue opened in mid 2003 and closed in 2013. Description and history Exposed brick wall, Backspace interior, 2013 Owner and painter Eric Robison opened Backspace, which was located at 115 Northwest 5th Avenue in Portland's Old Town Chinatown neighborhood, as a coffee shop in July 2003. Note: This article is also credited to Knight Ridder of Tribune Business News. He was inspired by two nearby stores within the same neighborhood, operated by Katsu Tanaka: Compound, a gallery, and Just Be Toys, a Japanese-themed toy and DVD rental store. Robison and his brother Kris had considered operating the business in the Pearl District, but were \\"attracted to the edginess\\" of the building. He recalled, \\"People said, 'Dude, you're insane,' when I told them where it was. I saw the exposed brick, and the whole cyberpunk feel that we could pursue. It was a little too frou-frou in the Pearl.\\" Robison also recalled fending off drug activity outside the store by barring dealers and users from entry. The building that housed Backspace was renovated by the city and Portland Development Commission. Interior art display, 2013 The establishment had been described as a gallery, a computer gaming and Internet caf√©, and an \\"oft- beleaguered\\" all-ages music venue. It was one of several businesses in the neighborhood, including Ground Kontrol, geared towards young people who worked in the technology industry. According to Willamette Week Matthew Singer, Backspace \\"[evolved] into the epicenter of Portland's underage music culture\\" because of a one-off Thermals performance in 2007. The space hosted a variety of events, including Portland Development Commission meetings (2007), an anti- bullying event called \\"Frank Conversations: Speaking Out on Bullying\\" (2010), and a concert by Dustin Ruth, the Battle Ground, Washington-based singer- songwriter and frontman of the band Ruth (2011). Closure Interior wall, 2013 Beginning in the late 2000s, Backspace had a string of financial difficulties. The business almost closed in 2008, but was able to continue operating after the Oregon Liquor Control Commission permitted Backspace to serve beer and wine while hosting all-ages events and performances. In 2012, Robison began raising funds to help eliminate $10,000 in \\"delinquent late fees for past-due rent and licensing\\" from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI). Robison decided to relocate when the city pass an ordinance requiring nightclubs in older buildings to install sprinkler systems. One of the property investors said the building's owners elected not to renew the cafe's lease because \\"music [was] not compatible with rest of tenants in the building\\". In September 2013, Robison confirmed that he wanted to relocate the business to a larger space before its lease expired in November. He originally planned to move Backspace to a building along Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. When plans fell through, he considered relocating to a different location in northeast Portland. However, this plan meant Backspace would not be able to reopen until the spring season of 2014 because of ongoing renovation efforts. In October, Robison said Backspace would stop hosting live performances after its Halloween celebration and would remain open temporarily as a coffee shop. He told Willamette Week: \\"The one thing we want to do is build it right. Backspace was all patchwork and chewing gum. We want to build something that will last.\\" Robison hoped to host one final concert in Backspace's original location on New Year's Eve, 2013, featuring a \\"big-name local act, pending landlord approval\\". In his 2014 article \\"RIP: 11 Shuttered PDX Bars and Restaurants We'll Miss\\", Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson wrote, \\"We'll miss dancing in this boisterous bar/gallery that was decked out like a geeky Internet cafe with a photo booth, pinball machines, a treehouse, and... wait! It was a geeky Internet cafe that whole time?!\\" After sitting vacant for over a year, the location was remodeled to accommodate an expansion of the Ground Kontrol video game and pinball arcade and bar located in the same building.

They demanded the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian, and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. The group began a standoff with government forces, with growing crowds of protesters joining the calls for the resignation of the president. In a 2017 survey the 38% of respondents supported Sasna Tsrer's actions, while 16% condemned. Background A controversial election occurred in 2013 which led to a loss of popularity for the governing Republican Party of Armenia. The Lebanese-born ethnic Armenian Jirair Sefilian led opposing forces under the formation New Armenia Public Salvation Front. Sefilian was arrested in 2006 on charges of calling for \\"a violent overthrow of the government\\" and was jailed for 18 months. He was then released in 2008. In 2015, he and several of his supporters were arrested again on suspicion of preparing a coup, but released shortly afterwards. On 20 June 2016, Sefilian was arrested yet again. According to the Armenian Special Investigation Service, Sefilian and a group of people planned to seize buildings and communication facilities, including the Yerevan TV tower. When Sefilian was formally charged with acquiring and possessing weapons when he appeared in court, the allegations of plotting a coup were dropped. Varuzhan Avetisian, a future Sasna Tsrer member, claimed that the opposition leader was arrested because he planned to campaign against Armenian territorial concessions to Azerbaijan. Tensions in the country have also been running high over Russian mediation attempts following the aftermath of the 2016 Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes. With the Kremlin suggesting to give some land back to Azerbaijan and in turn allow the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to receive international recognition. Hostage taking The Daredevils of Sassoun took over the Ereubuni police station in Yerevan around 5:30 a.m. on July 17, 2016. The armed group drove a vehicle through the front door of the police station. One policeman was killed and at least two were injured (one of them died in hospital in 13 August). Nine people were taken hostage. Two policemen were released following negotiations. General Vitaly Balasanyan, a mediator between the government and the opposition, said those released were Yerevan's deputy police chief Valery Osipyan and national deputy police chief Vardan Yeghiazaryan. Throughout the day Facebook was inaccessible and the websites of media outlets reporting on developments were being shut down. On July 21, after releasing two hostages, the gunmen still held onto four hostages total. These hostages included: General Major Vardan Egiazaryan, the deputy head of the Armenian police force, and Colonel Valeri Osipyan, the deputy chief of Yerevan‚Äôs municipal police force. During the siege two of the armed men had sustained injuries On July 22, President Serzh Sargsyan addressed the nation and said, \\" I urge the armed people, who have occupied the territory of the police headquarters, to show restraint and not endanger the lives of others with their reckless moves. Hostages must be released,‚Äù and also added that the armed group must also surrender their weapons. The same day, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Supreme Body of Armenia condemned the acts of Sasna Tsrer by stating, \\"The A.R.F.-Dashnaktsutyun seeks the settlement of the current situation exclusively by peaceful means, considers new bloodshed as unacceptable, demands professionalism from law enforcing agencies, demands that the rights and dignity of law-abiding citizens be respected, and strongly condemns non-political methods and extremist thinking.\\" On 23 July, there were indications the standoff was over. Four officers were set free, which included Vartan Yeghiazarian and Valeri Osipinian. During negotiations, Armenian law enforcement allowed Sasna Tsrer to speak with journalists in a designated neutral zone around the occupied police station. Approximately 40 reporters held a news conference but were not allowed to hold a live broadcast. At the news conference, Pavlik Manukyan stated that the police department has become evil for the people and enjoy lavish life styles with the use of unnecessary military equipment for policing. On 25 July, the gunmen had set a police vehicle on fire inside the headquarters, according to police spokesman Ashot Aharonian. It was the third vehicle to have been burned in two days. On July 27, 4 medics were allowed to enter the police station to treat Araik Handonyan, one of the armed men who was wounded in the leg but refused to go to the hospital. On July 30, the police issued an ultimatum to release all hostages and vacate the building or prepare for a police assault. Sasna Tsrer opened fire and shot down another officer. The group eventually surrendered that day to avoid further bloodshed. After surrendering, the group issued a statement saying, \\"We will continue our struggle from prison. We believe that we have achieved our goal: we became the spark that allowed people to rise up and it makes no sense to spill blood.\\" Demonstrators chose to march down Baghramyan Avenue towards the presidential residence and government buildings but were met with police, who placed coils of barbed wire across the avenue to stop the protests. Demonstrators still managed to block traffic for two hours and eventually dispersed the following day. Solidarity Over 1,500 anti-government protesters held a rally in Yerevan on 18 July, calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Violent protests also occurred where opposition supporters threw stones at police outside the hostage situation. They were hit back with tear gas and stun grenades. On 25 July, in a large show of support, thousands of protesters marched in Yerevan chanting \\"unity\\" and called for bystanders to join them‚Äîwho swelled their numbers‚Äîas the march progressed toward Yerevan‚Äôs central Republic Square. On 28 July, with the protesters growing in number -ranging between 12,000 and 20,000-, riot police fired stun and flash grenades on one group of protesters and journalists, while a large group of plainclothes police attacked them with metal rods, and entered neighboring homes. 60 people were injured. The international community condemned these attacks and the attacks on the journalists. 14 journalists were attacked during the incident.RFE/RL live broadcast at 9:10am PST Popular political activiests were arrested including Alexander Yenikomshian, Armen Martirosyan, Andrias Ghukasyan, David Sanasaryan. Yeghishe Petrosyan, one of the leaders of \\"Ardzagank\\" rock band, was also arrested and then released.  End of crisis  On 31 July, the crisis ended after the gunmen surrendered following police threats to storm the building. Police reported that 20 gunmen were arrested and the police station was unoccupied. Health Ministry Spokeswoman Anahit Haytayan also announced that the last two remaining hostages, both medics who were in the compound to treat the wounded of their own volition, had been released. Before surrendering, the attackers released a statement that read: \\"We will continue our struggle from prison. We believe that we have achieved our goal: we became the spark that allowed people to rise up and it makes no sense to spill blood.\\" They also stated \\"We want the people, and the international community, to realise that this is a national liberation movement against Russian colonialism\\".Armenians challenge age-old links to Russia, BBC News (10 August 2016) The protests in Yerevan continued from 1 to 11 August.‘±’¶’°’ø’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ’∞÷Ä’°’∫’°÷Ä’°’Ø’´ ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’∂ ’∏÷Ç’≤’´’≤ ’•’©’•÷Ä’∏’æ On 4 August, during a rally in Yerevan, about 20 protesters were taken into police custody. Aftermath As a result of internal investigation in the Armenian police, a number of policemen were fined. The Chief of Yerevan Police, Lieutenant General Ashot Karapetyan, also received a strict warning and was relieved of his duties on 8 August. He was sacked upon order of the Armenian Chief of Police Vladimir Gasparyan. Casualties On July 21, 2016 Protests erupted within Yerevan because of the government's handling of the hostage situation. Armenian interior ministry stated 51 people were injured, 28 of whom were police officers due to stone throwing from protestors. Police reported 136 people have been detained during the government protests. Protesters taken to police regiments were beaten and not given food or water for hours. On 30 July, the police claimed that a sniper opened fire from inside the police station and killed a police officer who was sitting in a car parked 350‚Äì400 metres (about 1,200 feet) away, bringing the total police death count to two. Sasna Tsrrer denied responsibility for the shooting and said they did not have a line of sight to have shot the officer, which police deny. The gunmen suggested that of the two deaths, one could have been shot by police snipers by mistake. On 30 July, an Armenian protester, Kajik Grigoryan, attempted self-immolation, burning over 50 percent of his body. On 2 August, he died in hospital. On March 16 2017, Arthur Sargsyan, known also as the ‚ÄúBread bringer‚Äù, who brought food to the ‚ÄúSasna Tsrer‚Äù armed group, died in prison. After the news came out, his supporters organized marches in Yerevan. Reactions ;Armenian First Deputy Police Chief Hunan Pogosyan said during the early days: \\"Talks are underway with the hostage-takers. We are doing our best to resolve the situation without bloodshed.\\" On 29 July, activists called upon members of the Armenian diaspora to raise awareness of the \\"regime violence\\" in Armenia.http://www.epress.am/en/2016/07/31/civil-society- activists-call-on-diaspora-to-raise-awareness-of-‚Äòregime-violence‚Äô-in- armenia.html Within the North American diaspora, Serj Tankian wrote in favor of the protesters and Lebanese-born Arsin√©e Khanjian participated in the protests and spoke in favor of the protests.

In Europe, three French-Armenian organizations (Renaissance Arm√©nienne, Charjoum le Mouvement and CollectifAzatDzayn) declared their support for the protesters ;International The European Union's Federica Mogherini issued a statement that read: \\"The latest developments... are very worrying. We call for an immediate release of the medical staff that is being held hostage. At the same time, we reiterate our call on the Armenian authorities to refrain from excessive use of force by the police in handling public manifestations. Likewise, demonstrators need to refrain from violence in the exercise of their civil rights. Use of force and violence to achieve political change are not acceptable. Conflicts need to be resolved through political dialogue with a respect for democracy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms.\\" According to Human Rights Watch, Armenian police used excessive force against peaceful protesters on 29 July 2016, and assaulted journalists reporting on the demonstrations. The police also beat journalists and protesters and detained dozens of people: ‚ÄúWhile the police have an obligation to maintain public order, they do not have carte blanche to use violence against people gathered to peacefully express their views.‚Äù Reporters Without Borders also issued a statement. Freedom House published an analysis reporting that the occupation of a police station \\"drew unexpected public support\\".

He was a Mormon pioneer who migrated to Utah with the Martin Handcart Company. McBride was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Early life Heber Robert McBride was born to Margaret Howard and Robert McBride on May 13, 1843 in Lancashire, England. His father was from Scotland, and his mother was from Lancashire. He was one of their 5 children. McBride's family immigrated to the United States after McBride and his parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1856. He was only 13 when they traveled to the United States on the ship Horizon with approximately 950 other people. They landed in Boston, Massachusetts, and a few days later traveled westward to Chicago, Illinois and then Iowa City. Martin Handcart Company McBride's family migrated west to Utah on November 30, 1856, leaving with the Martin Handcart Company led by Edward Martin. His handcart company had approximately 500 people when it began its westward trek. Both of his parents became ill on the trip, and his father died. Being the oldest son in the family, McBride helped pull the handcart with his older sister, Jennetta, making the journey to the Salt Lake Valley on foot. While on their journey, the group was faced with rationing and were caught in snowstorms. \\"Nearly all the children would cry themselves to sleep every night\\" wrote McBride. Ten wagons came from Salt Lake City to help the handcart company finish their journey. They did eventually arrive in Salt Lake, although in \\"a very pitiable condition.\\" After his own experience crossing the plains, he helped others immigrate into Utah in 1865. He was called by Brigham Young to help immigrants who were stranded at Platte River in October 1866. His experience with the Martin Handcart Company was recorded in his personal journal which is now at the Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library in their L. Tom Perry Special Collections. Life in Utah McBride settled in Utah. In 1857 and 1858, he fought against Johnston's Army during the Utah War. He worked for some time hauling lumber to Plain City, Utah from the North Ogden Pass, and later took a job ferrying wood to Salt Lake. While on one of his boat trips, his boat got caught in a storm, and because he had not returned home, he was reported dead. He later bought a farm for $500. He spent the winter of 1862 in his home by the North Fork Fiver, but moved to Huntsville, Utah to attend school. McBride recorded that in 1863 there were a number of Indians that were scattering livestock, and he was called to be a scout in the Black Hawk War in Utah Territory. He developed a friendship with a Native American named Tope even during the war. In 1868, McBride helped settle Ogden Valley, and the following year he helped construct the Union Pacific Railroad. McBride married Elizabeth Ann Burns on July 28, 1868. He later married Elizabeth B. Gould on November 24, 1884, and they had four children. He moved to Raymond, Canada, near Lethbridge on June 5, 1904. He died in the summer of 1925. He is noted in the book Pioneers and Prominent Men of Utah and his autobiography is frequently cited by Mormon historians for its documentation of conditions in the Martin Handcart Company.

Unveiled during a press conference held on July 26, 2016, it is BlackBerry's second Android device after the BlackBerry Priv slider. As with the Priv, the DTEK50's Android operating system is customized with features inspired by those seen on BlackBerry's in-house operating systems, and with hardware and software security enhancements (such as the titular DTEK software). The DTEK50 received mixed reviews, with critics noting the quality of its display and BlackBerry's software enhancements, but arguing that BlackBerry's claimed security enhancements were redundant to security features included in the base Android operating system, the lack of fingerprint reader was a questionable exclusion for a device marketed as being security-oriented, and that the device was not sufficiently competitive in comparison to other mid-range devices in its class.  Specifications  Hardware The DTEK50 is manufactured by TCL, is similar in design to the Alcatel Idol 4, although with a rubber backing instead of glass. It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 system-on-chip with 3 GB of RAM, and features a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS LCD display. The device includes 16 GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card, and a 2610 mAh battery. The device features a programmable \\"convenience key\\" on its bezel, which can be used for different features. It features a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with digital image stabilization and a dual-LED flash, an 84-degree wide-angle f/2.0 lens, and phase detection auto focus as well as an 8-megapixel front- facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture and flash. Software The DTEK50 shipped with Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\", customized with additional features and BlackBerry-developed apps, similarly to the BlackBerry Priv, such as BlackBerry Hub, DTEK‚Äîwhich serves as a dashboard for notifying users of the security and privacy status of their device, and pop-up widgets. BlackBerry committed to releasing regular security updates to the DTEK50's Android software.  Reception  The DTEK50 received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that the device did not sufficiently differentiate itself from other smartphones in its class. Engadget positioned the DTEK50 as a \\"fleet device\\" meant to be purchased in bulk for adoption by a company's employees due to its low price and focus on security. The device was described as being \\"respectably well built and even sort of handsome (in an understated sort of way\\", and being thin and light yet not feeling \\"cheap\\". The DTEK50's display was considered to be \\"pretty damned good\\" for a mid-range device and only \\"fell short\\" in comparison to the similarly-positioned ZTE Axon 7 (which features a 1440p display). The convenience key was panned for not having as many supported features as the equivalent on the Idol 4. The lack of a fingerprint reader (especially given the device's wider focus on security) and inconsistent battery life was also panned. In conclusion, it was argued that the Moto G4 Plus was better value at the same price point due to its larger amount of storage and inclusion of a fingerprint reader, and that \\"as a ploy to appeal to those crucial business customers, it's brilliant. For them, the DTEK50 is a solid, not-very-expensive option with the security chops to put IT paranoiacs at ease. As a phone for regular people, though, the DTEK50 is a much a tougher sell.\\" The Verge felt that the DTEK50's display was \\"pretty nice for a $300 phone\\", but the overall hardware was described as being of average specifications. The DTEK50's Android software was praised for maintaining the user experience introduced by the Priv, but with fewer bugs and additional refinements. The camera was appraised as being decent \\"under ideal conditions\\", and poor in low-light situations. The phone's performance and battery life was also criticized. In regards to security, it was noted that Android \\"Marshmallow\\" had already implemented security features such as mandatory device encryption and finer control of permission grants, but that the DTEK software helped to promote privacy best practices, and that BlackBerry had consistently delivered Android's monthly security patches to its devices. However, the DTEK50 was panned for not including a fingerprint reader despite this focus on security. In conclusion, it was argued that while BlackBerry had \\"identified a market need and theoretically could do a great job filling it\\" with its security-oriented focus, the DTEK50 \\"fails to stand out in a competitive field of midrange smartphones.\\" CNET similarly pointed out that many of BlackBerry's claimed security enhancements \\"seem to either be placebos or functions already found on stock Android devices\\", such as device encryption (mandatory on Marshmallow) and boot verification (which is strictly enforced on Android Nougat, but with notifications on Marshmallow), and that the device as shipped was vulnerable to the Quadrooter exploit (which was patched on unlocked models at the time of the review). After receiving the heavy backlash about the price of DTEK50 in emerging markets like India, the Indian distributor OPTIEMUS have dropped the price and make it inline with the desired price tag of $300.

Career Brown was born in Harrisonburg, Virginia, and gained an A.B. degree from the University of Nashville in Tennessee in 1893. He then studied English literature at the University of Chicago, where he gained an M.A. in 1902 and Ph.D. in 1908. The following year, he was appointed professor of English at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina, where he became known as \\"Bull\\" Brown. He wrote a biography of the 17th-century poet and playwright Elkanah Settle, published in 1910, and as a teacher became noted for his work as an interpreter of Shakespeare. W. E.

Lomax, president of the American Folklore Society, to set up the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913, an organisation of which he was the inaugural president, and later secretary. Over the next thirty years he became the society's principal collector of folk songs and lore, and traveled around the region, often on summer expeditions to isolated areas, with recording equipment powered by a gasoline generator. Initially he recorded material on an Ediphone, using wax cylinders, and later used a Presto machine for recording onto aluminum discs. He took particular note of previously-unwritten ballads and songs, and in 1915 published Ballad Literature in North Carolina. However, \\"he was never able to stop collecting long enough to actually assemble his material.\\" The Frank Clyde Brown Collection of North Carolina Folklore, eventually published after his death, contained seven volumes comprising some 38,000 items including ballads, songs, games, rhymes, beliefs, customs, riddles, proverbs, tales, legends, superstitions, and speech, taken from the southeastern United States, particularly North Carolina, and has been described as \\"the most imposing monument ever erected in this country to the common memory of the people of any single state.\\" In 1921 Brown was appointed head of the English department at Trinity College. After 1924, he was also involved in administering the foundation of Duke University, serving as its first comptroller in 1926, and later as the new university's marshal. As liaison officer with architects and contractors, he assumed a supervisory role alongside Trinity's President, William P. Few, and is credited with contributing many ideas to the university's building plans, including its use of the then newly discovered Hillsborough stone.

Photo by Justin Hackworth. The National Parks is an American folk/pop band from Provo, Utah. The 4-member band consists of Brady Parks from Denver, Colorado (guitar and lead vocals), Sydney Macfarlane from Kaysville, Utah (keyboards and vocals), Cam Brannelly from Draper, Utah (drums), and Megan Taylor Parks from Draper, Utah (fiddle and vocals). Formed in 2013, with March 15, 2013 marking the band's first public performance, their debut album, Young, won them a devoted following, climbing to #13 on the ITunes singer/songwriter chart upon its release. Since that time, the band has released two additional studio albums and has sold out shows in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.  History   2012-2014: Formation and Young  The National Parks began as the brainchild of frontman Brady Parks. While studying Advertising Design at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, Parks began writing a collection of acoustic-heavy narrative folk tunes. After forming a group called Brady Parks and the IndiAnns for a battle of the bands at Velour Live Music Gallery, this group went on to record an album called The Mossy Mountain, which was released to iTunes and Spotify on February 24, 2012. The success of this first release prompted them to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign for the album that would eventually become Young. After several lineup changes, the group rebranded and started fresh as The National Parks, with March 15, 2013 marking the band's first public performance. This public performance was hyped by a guerrilla marketing campaign. Hundreds of flyers were circulated around Provo, UT that offered little information other than the line, ‚ÄúWho are The National Parks?‚Äù A link to their website led to a video containing commentary from popular local bands and music venue owners who each explained that The National Parks were a band to be excited about. The group released Young in 2013. The album was recorded at June Audio with producer Scott Wiley and climbed to #13 on the ITunes singer/songwriter chart. In January 2014 the band released the standalone single \\"As We Ran,\\" which was written for the documentary film Love in the Tetons. The group donated the first month of proceeds from the single to the National Parks Conservation Association. The National Parks began touring around the release of Young. The online success of the album and \\"As We Ran\\" helped them find growing crowds around Utah as well as in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City.  2015-2016: International Attention and Until I Live  International attention came to the band with the premiere of \\"Helsinki\\" on NPR's All Songs Considered in January 2015. The band again worked with Scott Wiley on their second album, Until I Live, which was independently released September 2015 and climbed to #52 on the iTunes Pop Chart and #5 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers Chart for the Mountain Region. In March 2016, the band was named Utah's \\"Band of the Year\\" by Salt Lake City Weekly magazine. The following month, \\"Monsters of the North\\" - the lead single from Until I Live - was announced as winner of the International Songwriting Competition for all unsigned artists. As part of the centennial of the National Park Service, The National Parks performed at an event with celebrated writer Terry Tempest Williams for the National Parks Conservation Association in June 2016. Since their sophomore release, the band has been favorably compared to a wide variety of acts including Foster the People, The Civil Wars, and Mumford & Sons, In addition to their own headlining shows, The National Parks has played with acts such as Andy Grammer, Peter Bjorn and John, The Lone Bellow, LeAnn Rimes, and The Moth & The Flame and performed at SXSW, Canadian Music Week, School Night at Bardot's, Musikfest, Snowmass Mammoth Fest, and Make Music Pasadena.  2017-present: Places  In August 2017, The National Parks performed on JBTV in Chicago, announcing that their third album, Places, would be released September 15, 2017. The music video for the lead single, \\"Places,\\" debuted through Impose Magazine on June 16, 2017. More pop infused than previous releases, Places features folk-pop song craft on acoustic guitar and violin, backed by electronic textures. On September 8, 2017, the band launched the Places Tour. The tour concluded October 27, 2017 and took the band through 19 different cities across the United States. On March 22, 2019, The National Parks released a new single, \\"I Can Feel It\\" References Rock music groups from Utah 2013 establishments in Utah Musical groups established in 2013 Alternative rock groups from Utah Indie rock musical groups from Utah Musical quintets ","title":"The National Parks (band)"},{"id":"51173145","text":"The Swan 46 Mk II was designed by German Frers and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 1990.

Role The district officer was an administrator and often also a magistrate and was the link between the professional and technical services of the colonial government and the people of his district. He was at the heart of colonial administration throughout most of the British Empire, although not in British India, where the same functions were carried out by members of the Indian Civil Service, nor in the self-governing Dominions.Anthony Kirk-Greene, On Crown Service: A History of HM Colonial and Overseas Civil Services, 1837-1997 (London: I. B. Tauris & Co., 1999)Anthony Kirk-Greene, Symbol of Authority: The British District Officer in Africa (London: I. B. Tauris & Co.), Outline at ibtauris.com, accessed 27 July 2016 District Officers wore uniforms, according to the climate, but their formal tunic with gold braid was usually reserved for ceremonial occasions. Until the 1930s, each overseas possession had its own administrative service, and prospective District Officers needed to apply to one or more of them. Once in post, an officer wishing to transfer to another colony or British protectorate had to make a new application to its government. However, in the 1930s a unified Colonial Service was created, with a number of sub-services, and each of its officers was a member of the civil service of a particular territory and also of one of the sub-services of the Colonial Service managed by the Colonial Office, based in Whitehall. Career progression Before being appointed, a candidate was first a District Officer Cadet, undergoing a rigorous training, and was then promoted to Assistant District Officer, usually after two years of successful probation and after passing examinations.E. K. Lumley, Forgotten Mandate: A British District Officer in Tanganyika (C. Hurst & Co, 1976), p. 10 On being appointed as a District Officer, he took on the administration of a District, usually in the territory of the Empire where he was. Because of the number of districts, many District Officers remained in the same role until leaving the Colonial Service. If they were promoted, they became first District Commissioners, then Provincial Commissioners. Some rose to the pinnacle of being colonial Governors, although men were also appointed as Governors whose previous careers had been in other services. In particular, the Governors of Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Malta, and Bermuda were almost invariably senior British Army or Royal Navy officers.

Origins In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first proclamation for farm safety due to the high injury rate in agriculture. Agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries with a death rate of 23.2 deaths per 100,000 workers annually according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013. However, many injuries are preventable through education. Serious injuries and death can be prevented by cautiously approaching field adjustments or repairs, taking precautions to avoid slips and falls, making smart decisions while assigning tasks to youth, using and maintaining the slow moving vehicle emblem correctly, and retrofitting tractors with rollover structures. History In September 2015, President Obama gave an official proclamation to accentuate the importance of agriculture for our society and economy as well as affirm farm safety and health programs \\"America's farmers and ranchers have played a critical role in shaping our progress and forging a better future for coming generations. Through centuries of hard work, they have supplied our Nation with products and services essential to the economic and physical well-being of our society. \\"Across our country, those who work on farms bolster our economy and nourish our people by providing what we need at a most human level, helping to uphold America's founding creed: Out of many, we are one. This week, let us recognize the steadfast dedication and commitment of agricultural producers and their families, and let us reaffirm our resolve to promote their health and safety.\\" Over the years, the development and dissemination of National Farm Safety & Health Week materials shifted from the National Safety Council to National Education Center for Ag Safety (NECAS).

Algorithms   Simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983)  Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique inspired by a heat treatment method in metallurgy. It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities). For problems where finding the precise global optimum is less important than finding an acceptable local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to alternatives such as gradient descent. Simulated annealing interprets slow cooling as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as it explores the solution space. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the optimal solution.  Ant colony optimization (Dorigo, 1992)  The ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis,M. Dorigo, Optimization, Learning and Natural Algorithms, PhD thesis, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, 1992. the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms.  Particle swarm optimization (Kennedy & Eberhart 1995)  Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli. Recently, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.  Harmony search (Geem, Kim & Loganathan 2001)  Harmony search is a phenomenon-mimicking metaheuristic introduced in 2001 by Zong Woo Geem, Joong Hoon Kim, and G. V. Loganathan. Harmony search is inspired by the improvisation process of jazz musicians. A paper claimed that harmony search is proven to be a special case of the Evolution Strategies algorithm. However, a recent paper argues that the structure of Evolution Strategies is different from that of harmony search. Also, a programming code was provided for showing how HS to solve Sudoku. The Harmony search (HS) is a relatively simple yet very efficient evolutionary algorithm. In HS algorithm a bunch/group of solutions is randomly generated (Called Harmony memory). A new solution is generated by using all the solutions in the Harmony memory (rather than just two as used in GA) and if this new solution is better than the Worst solution in Harmony memory, the Worst solution gets replaced by this new solution. Although HS is a relatively new meta heuristic algorithm, its effectiveness and advantages have been demonstrated in various applications like design of municipal water distribution networks, structural design, traffic routing, load dispatch problem in electrical engineering, multi objective optimization, rostering problems, clustering, classification and feature selection to name a few. A detailed survey on applications of HS can be found in and applications of HS in data mining can be found in . Artificial bee colony algorithm (Karaboga 2005) Artificial bee colony algorithm is a meta-heuristic algorithm introduced by Karaboga in 2005, and simulates the foraging behaviour of honey bees. The ABC algorithm has three phases: employed bee, onlooker bee and scout bee. In the employed bee and the onlooker bee phases, bees exploit the sources by local searches in the neighbourhood of the solutions selected based on deterministic selection in the employed bee phase and the probabilistic selection in the onlooker bee phase. In the scout bee phase which is an analogy of abandoning exhausted food sources in the foraging process, solutions that are not beneficial anymore for search progress are abandoned, and new solutions are inserted instead of them to explore new regions in the search space. The algorithm has a well-balanced exploration and exploitation ability.  Bees algorithm (Pham 2005)  The bees algorithm in its basic formulation was created by Pham and his co-workers in 2005,Pham DT, Ghanbarzadeh A, Koc E, Otri S, Rahim S and Zaidi M. The Bees Algorithm. Technical Note, Manufacturing Engineering Centre, Cardiff University, UK, 2005. and further refined in the following years. Modelled on the foraging behaviour of honey bees, the algorithm combines global explorative search with local exploitative search. A small number of artificial bees (scouts) explores randomly the solution space (environment) for solutions of high fitness (highly profitable food sources), whilst the bulk of the population search (harvest) the neighbourhood of the fittest solutions looking for the fitness optimum. A deterministics recruitment procedure which simulates the waggle dance of biological bees is used to communicate the scouts' findings to the foragers, and distribute the foragers depending on the fitness of the neighbourhoods selected for local search. Once the search in the neighbourhood of a solution stagnates, the local fitness optimum is considered to be found, and the site is abandoned. In summary, the Bees Algorithm searches concurrently the most promising regions of the solution space, whilst continuously sampling it in search of new favourable regions.  Glowworm swarm optimization (Krishnanand & Ghose 2005)  The glowworm swarm optimization is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm developed based on the behaviour of glowworms (also known as fireflies or lightning bugs). The GSO algorithm was developed and introduced by K.N. Krishnanand and Debasish Ghose in 2005 at the Guidance, Control, and Decision Systems Laboratory in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. The behaviour pattern of glowworms which is used for this algorithm is the apparent capability of the glowworms to change the intensity of the luciferin emission and thus appear to glow at different intensities. # The GSO algorithm makes the agents glow at intensities approximately proportional to the function value being optimized. It is assumed that glowworms of brighter intensities attract glowworms that have lower intensity. # The second significant part of the algorithm incorporates a dynamic decision range by which the effect of distant glowworms are discounted when a glowworm has sufficient number of neighbours or the range goes beyond the range of perception of the glowworms. The part 2 of the algorithm makes it different from other evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithms. It is this step that allows glowworm swarms to automatically subdivide into subgroups which can then converge to multiple local optima simultaneously, This property of the algorithm allows it to be used to identify multiple peaks of a multi-modal function and makes it a part of the evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithms family.  Shuffled frog leaping algorithm (Eusuff, Lansey & Pasha 2006)  The shuffled frog leaping algorithm is an optimization algorithm used in artificial intelligence. It is comparable to a genetic algorithm.  Cat Swarm Optimization (Chu, Tsai, and Pan 2006)  The cat swarm optimization algorithm which solves optimization problems and is inspired by the behavior of cats. It is similar to other swarm optimization algorithms such as the Ant Colony Optimization or Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. Seeking and Tracing, two common behavior of cats, make up the two sub-models of the algorithm. Seeking Mode is inspired by the behavior of a cat at rest, seeking where to move next. In Seeking Mode, it selects several candidate points and then selects one to move to randomly, increasing the probability of choosing points that have a higher fitness value. Tracing Mode is inspired by a cat tracing some target. In this mode, the cat will try to move towards the position with the best fitness value. Cats will continue moving in Seeking and Tracing mode until a terminating condition is met.  Imperialist competitive algorithm (Atashpaz-Gargari & Lucas 2007)  The imperialist competitive algorithm is a computational method that is used to solve optimization problems of different types. Like most of the methods in the area of evolutionary computation, ICA does not need the gradient of the function in its optimization process. From a specific point of view, ICA can be thought of as the social counterpart of genetic algorithms (GAs). ICA is the mathematical model and the computer simulation of human social evolution, while GAs are based on the biological evolution of species. This algorithm starts by generating a set of random candidate solutions in the search space of the optimization problem. The generated random points are called the initial Countries. Countries in this algorithm are the counterpart of Chromosomes in GAs and Particles in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and it is an array of values of a candidate solution of optimization problem. The cost function of the optimization problem determines the power of each country. Based on their power, some of the best initial countries (the countries with the least cost function value), become Imperialists and start taking control of other countries (called colonies) and form the initial Empires. Two main operators of this algorithm are Assimilation and Revolution. Assimilation makes the colonies of each empire get closer to the imperialist state in the space of socio-political characteristics (optimization search space). Revolution brings about sudden random changes in the position of some of the countries in the search space. During assimilation and revolution a colony might reach a better position and has the chance to take the control of the entire empire and replace the current imperialist state of the empire. Imperialistic Competition is another part of this algorithm. All the empires try to win this game and take possession of colonies of other empires. In each step of the algorithm, based on their power, all the empires have a chance to take control of one or more of the colonies of the weakest empire. Algorithm continues with the mentioned steps (Assimilation, Revolution, Competition) until a stop condition is satisfied. The above steps can be summarized as the below pseudocode. 0) Define objective function: f(mathbf{x}), quad mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,dots,x_d); , 1) Initialization of the algorithm. Generate some random solution in the search space and create initial empires. 2) Assimilation: Colonies move towards imperialist states in different in directions. 3) Revolution: Random changes occur in the characteristics of some countries. 4) Position exchange between a colony and Imperialist. A colony with a better position than the imperialist, has the chance to take the control of empire by replacing the existing imperialist. 5) Imperialistic competition: All imperialists compete to take possession of colonies of each other. 6) Eliminate the powerless empires. Weak empires lose their power gradually and they will finally be eliminated. 7) If the stop condition is satisfied, stop, if not go to 2. 8) End  River formation dynamics (Rabanal, Rodr√≠guez & Rubio 2007)  River formation dynamics is based on imitating how water forms rivers by eroding the ground and depositing sediments (the drops act as the swarm). After drops transform the landscape by increasing/decreasing the altitude of places, solutions are given in the form of paths of decreasing altitudes. Decreasing gradients are constructed, and these gradients are followed by subsequent drops to compose new gradients and reinforce the best ones. This heuristic optimization method was first presented in 2007 by Rabanal et al. The applicability of RFD to other NP- complete problems has been studied, and the algorithm has been applied to fields such as routing and robot navigation. The main applications of RFD can be found at a detailed survey.  Intelligent water drops algorithm (Shah- Hosseini 2007)  Intelligent water drops algorithm contains a few essential elements of natural water drops and actions and reactions that occur between river's bed and the water drops that flow within. The IWD was first introduced for the traveling salesman problem in 2007. Almost every IWD algorithm is composed of two parts: a graph that plays the role of distributed memory on which soils of different edges are preserved, and the moving part of the IWD algorithm, which is a few number of Intelligent water drops. These intelligent water drops (IWDs) both compete and cooperate to find better solutions and by changing soils of the graph, the paths to better solutions become more reachable. It is mentioned that the IWD-based algorithms need at least two IWDs to work. The IWD algorithm has two types of parameters: static and dynamic parameters. Static parameters are constant during the process of the IWD algorithm. Dynamic parameters are reinitialized after each iteration of the IWD algorithm. The pseudo-code of an IWD-based algorithm may be specified in eight steps: :1) Static parameter initialization :: a) Problem representation in the form of a graph :: b) Setting values for static parameters :2) Dynamic parameter initialization: soil and velocity of IWDs :3) Distribution of IWDs on the problem‚Äôs graph :4) Solution construction by IWDs along with soil and velocity updating :: a) Local soil updating on the graph :: b) Soil and velocity updating on the IWDs :5) Local search over each IWD‚Äôs solution (optional) : 6) Global soil updating : 7) Total-best solution updating : 8) Go to step 2 unless termination condition is satisfied  Gravitational search algorithm (Rashedi, Nezamabadi-pour & Saryazdi 2009)  A gravitational search algorithm is based on the law of gravity and the notion of mass interactions. The GSA algorithm uses the theory of Newtonian physics and its searcher agents are the collection of masses. In GSA, there is an isolated system of masses. Using the gravitational force, every mass in the system can see the situation of other masses. The gravitational force is therefore a way of transferring information between different masses (Rashedi, Nezamabadi-pour and Saryazdi 2009). In GSA, agents are considered as objects and their performance is measured by their masses. All these objects attract each other by a gravity force, and this force causes movement of all objects towards the objects with heavier masses. Heavier masses correspond to better solutions of the problem. The position of the agent corresponds to a solution of the problem, and its mass is determined using a fitness function. By lapse of time, masses are attracted by the heaviest mass, which would ideally present an optimum solution in the search space. The GSA could be considered as an isolated system of masses. It is like a small artificial world of masses obeying the Newtonian laws of gravitation and motion.Rashedi, Nezamabadi-pour and Saryazdi 2009 A multi-objective variant of GSA, called MOGSA, was first proposed by Hassanzadeh et al. in 2010.  Cuckoo search (Yang & Deb 2009)  In operations research, cuckoo search is an optimization algorithm developed by Xin-she Yang and Suash Deb in 2009. It was inspired by the obligate brood parasitism of some cuckoo species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds (of other species). Some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos. For example, if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own, it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere. Some cuckoo species such as the New World brood-parasitic Tapera have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colors and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species.R. B. Payne, M. D. Sorenson, and K. Klitz, The Cuckoos, Oxford University Press, (2005).  Bat algorithm (Yang 2010)  Bat algorithm is a swarm-intelligence-based algorithm, inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. BA automatically balances exploration (long-range jumps around the global search space to avoid getting stuck around one local maximum) with exploitation (searching in more detail around known good solutions to find local maxima) by controlling loudness and pulse emission rates of simulated bats in the multi- dimensional search space.  Spiral optimization (SPO) algorithm (Tamura & Yasuda 2011,2016-2017)  Spiral optimization (SPO) algorithm The spiral optimization (SPO) algorithm is an uncomplicated search concept inspired by spiral phenomena in nature. The motivation for focusing on spiral phenomena was due to the insight that the dynamics that generate logarithmic spirals share the diversification and intensification behavior. The diversification behavior can work for a global search (exploration) and the intensification behavior enables an intensive search around a current found good solution (exploitation). The SPO algorithm is a multipoint search algorithm that has no objective function gradient, which uses multiple spiral models that can be described as deterministic dynamical systems. As search points follow logarithmic spiral trajectories towards the common center, defined as the current best point, better solutions can be found and the common center can be updated.  Flower pollination algorithm (Yang 2012)  Flower pollination algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that was developed by Xin-She Yang, based on the pollination process of flowering plants. This algorithm has 4 rules or assumptions: #Biotic and cross-pollination is considered as a global pollination process with pollen carrying pollinators performing Levy flights. #Abiotic and self-pollination are considered as local pollination. #Flower constancy can be considered as the reproduction probability is proportional to the similarity of two flowers involved. # Local and global pollination are controlled by a switch probability p in [0, 1]. Due to the physical proximity and other factors such as wind, local pollination can have a significant fraction q in the overall pollination activities. These rules can be translated into the following updating equations: : x_i^{t+1}=x_i^t + L (x_i^t-g_*) : x_i^{t+1}=x_i^t + epsilon (x_i^t-x_k^t) where x_i^t is the solution vector and g_* is the current best found so far during iteration. The switch probability between two equations during iterations is p. In addition, epsilon is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution. L is a step size drawn from a L√©vy distribution. L√©vy flights using L√©vy steps is a powerful random walk because both global and local search capabilities can be carried out at the same time. In contrast with standard Random walks, L√©vy flights have occasional long jumps, which enable the algorithm to jump out any local valleys. L√©vy steps obey the following approximation: : L sim frac{1}{s^{1+beta}}, where beta is the L√©vy exponent. It may be challenging to draw L√©vy steps properly, and a simple way of generating L√©vy flights s is to use two normal distributions u and v by a transformX. S. Yang, Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms, Elsevier, (2014). : s = frac{u}{v^{1+beta}}, with : u sim N(0, sigma^2), quad v sim N(0,1), where sigma is a function of beta.  Cuttlefish optimization algorithm (Eesa, Mohsin, Brifcani & Orman 2013)  The six cases of reflection used by the Cuttlefish The cuttlefish optimization algorithm is a population-based search algorithm inspired by skin color changing behaviour of Cuttlefish which was developed in 2013 It has two global search and two local search. The algorithm considers two main processes: Reflection and Visibility. Reflection process simulates the light reflection mechanism, while visibility simulates the visibility of matching patterns. These two processes are used as a search strategy to find the global optimal solution. The formulation of finding the new solution (newP) by using reflection and visibility is as follows: newP = Reflection + Visibility CFA divide the population into 4 Groups (G1, G2, G3 and G4). For G1 the algorithm applying case 1 and 2 (the interaction between chromatophores and iridophores) to produce a new solutions. These two cases are used as a global search. For G2, the algorithm uses case 3 (Iridophores reflection opaerator) and case 4 (the interaction between Iridophores and chromatophores) to produces a new solutions) as a local search. While for G3 the interaction between the leucophores and chromatophores (case 5) is used to produce solutions around the best solution (local search). Finally for G4, case 6 (reflection operator of leucophores) is used as a global search by reflecting any incoming light as it with out any modification. The main step of CFA is described as follows: 1 Initialize population (P[N]) with random solutions, Assign the values of r1, r2, v1, v2. 2 Evaluate the population and Keep the best solution. 3 Divide population into four groups (G1, G2, G3 and G4). 4 Repeat 4.1 Calculate the average value of the best solution. 4.2 for (each element in G1) generate new solution using Case(1 and 2) 4.3 for (each element in G2) generate new solution using Case(3 and 4) 4.4 for (each element in G3) generate new solution using Case(5) 4.5 for (each element in G4) generate new solution using Case(6) 4.6 Evaluate the new solutions 5. Until (stopping criterion is met) 6. Return the best solution Equations that are used to calculate reflection and visibility for the four Groups are described below: Case 1 and 2 for G1: Reflection[j] = R*G_{1}[j].Points[j] Visibility[j] = V*(Best.Points[j]-G_{1}[i].Points[j]) Case 3 and 4 for G2: Reflection[j] = R*Best.Points[j] Visibility[j] = V*(Best.Points[j]-G_{2}[i].Points[j]) Case 5 for G3: Reflection[j] = R*Best.Points[j] Visibility[j] = V*(Best.Points[j]-AV_{Best} Case 6 for G4: P[i].Points[j] = random*(upperLimit-lowerLinit)+LowerLimit, i = 1, 2, ..., N; j=1, 2, ..., d Where G_{1}, G_{2} are Group1 and Group2, i presents the i^{th} element in G, j is the j^{th} point of i^{th} element in group G, Best is the best solution and AV_{Best} presents the average value of the Best points. While R and V are two random numbers produced around zero such as between (-1, 1), R represents the degree of reflection, V represents the visibility degree of the final view of the pattern, upperLimit and lowerLimit are the upper limit and the lower limit of the problem domain.  Heterogeneous Distributed Bees Algorithm (Tkach et al., 2013)  The Heterogeneous Distributed Bees Algorithm (HDBA) also known as the Modified Distributed Bees Algorithm (MDBA) is a multi-agent metaheuristic algorithm initially introduced by Tkach and his co-workers in 2013, developed as part of his PhD dissertation. HDBA uses probabilistic technique taking inspiration from the foraging behaviour of bees. It enables to solve combinatorial optimization problems with multiple heterogeneous agents that possess different capabilities and performances. The final decision-making mechanism uses a wheel-selection rule, where each agent has a probability with which it selects a solution. It was first applied for the case of heterogeneous sensors in target recognition problem to improve system performance by correlating sensors‚Äô utility function with the value of their performances. Afterwards, it was successfully applied to other problems, including the problem of allocating police agents to crime incidents and producing near-optimal solutions to the travelling salesman problem.  Cooperative Group Optimization (2014)  Cooperative group optimization (CGO) system is a metaheuristic framework for implementing algorithm instances by integrating the advantages of the cooperative group and low-level algorithm portfolio design. Following the nature-inspired paradigm of a cooperative group, the agents not only explore in a parallel way with their individual memory, but also cooperate with their peers through the group memory. Each agent holds a portfolio of (heterogeneous) embedded search heuristics (ESHs), in which each ESH can drive the group into a stand-alone CGO case, and hybrid CGO cases in an algorithmic space can be defined by low-level cooperative search among an algorithm portfolio (of ESHs) through customized memory sharing. The optimization process might also be facilitated by a passive group leader through encoding knowledge in the search landscape. It has been applied on both numerical and combinatorial optimization problems.  Artificial swarm intelligence (Rosenberg 2014)  Artificial swarm intelligence refers to a real-time closed-loop system of human users connected over the internet and structured in a framework modeled after natural swarms such that it evokes the group's collective wisdom as a unified emergent intelligence. In this way, human swarms can answer questions, make predictions, reach decisions, and solve problems by collectively exploring a diverse set of options and converging on preferred solutions in synchrony. Invented by Dr. Louis Rosenberg in 2014, the ASI methodology has become notable for its ability to make accurate collective predictions that outperform the individual members of the swarm. In 2016 an Artificial Swarm Intelligence from Unanimous A.I. was challenged by a reporter to predict the winners of the Kentucky Derby, and successfully picked the first four horses, in order, beating 540 to 1 odds.  Colliding bodies optimization (Kaveh and Mahdavi 2014)  The Colliding bodies optimization (CBO) algorithm was created by Kaveh and Mahdavi in 2014 based on laws of momentum and energy. This algorithm does not depend on any internal parameter and also it is extremely simple to implement and to use and used in different types of problems in engineering.  Duelist Algorithm (Biyanto 2016)  Duelist algorithm refers to a gene-based optimization algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms. Duelist Algorithm starts with an initial set of duelists. The duel is to determine the winner and loser. The loser learns from the winner, while the winner try their new skill or technique that may improve their fighting capabilities. A few duelists with highest fighting capabilities are called as champion. The champion train a new duelist such as their capabilities. The new duelist will join the tournament as a representative of each champion. All duelist are re-evaluated, and the duelists with worst fighting capabilities is eliminated to maintain the amount of duelists.  Harris hawks optimization (Heidari et al. 2019)  Harris hawks optimizer (HHO) inspires the hunting strategies of Harris's hawk and escaping patterns of rabbits in nature.  Killer Whale Algorithm (Biyanto 2016)  Killer Whale Algorithm is an algorithm Inspired by the Killer Whale Life. The philosophy of algorithm is the patterns of movement Killer Whale in prey hunting and Killer whale social structure. The novelty of this algorithm is incorporating \\"memorize capability\\" of Killer Whale in the algorithm.  Rain Water Algorithm (Biyanto 2017)  \\"Physical movements of rain drops by utilizing Newton‚Äôs Law motion\\" was inspired the authors to create this algorithm. Each rain drop represent as random values of optimized variables that it have vary in mass and elevation. It will fall on the ground by following \\"the free fall movement\\" with velocity is square root of gravity acceleration time elevation. The next movement is \\"uniformly accelerated motion\\" along the rain drop travel to reach the lowest place on the ground. The lowest place in the ground is an objective function of this algorithm.  Mass and Energy Balances Algorithm (Biyanto 2018)  Mass and Energy Balances is a fundamental \\"laws of physics\\" states that mass can neither be produced nor destroyed. It is only conserved. Equally fundamental is the law of conservation of energy. Although energy can change in form, it can not be created or destroyed also. The beauty of this algorithm is the capability to reach the global optimum solution by simultaneously work either \\"minimize and maximize searching method\\".  Hydrological Cycle Algorithm (Wedyan et al. 2017)  A new nature-inspired optimization algorithm called the Hydrological Cycle Algorithm (HCA) is proposed based on the continuous movement of water in nature. In the HCA, a collection of water drops passes through various hydrological water cycle stages, such as flow, evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Each stage plays an important role in generating solutions and avoiding premature convergence. The HCA shares information by direct and indirect communication among the water drops, which improves solution quality. HCA provides an alternative approach to tackling various types of optimization problems as well as an overall framework for water-based particle algorithms in general.  Emperor Penguins Colony (Harifi et al. 2019)  This algorithm is a new metaheuristic algorithm that inspired by the behavior of emperor penguins that live in Antarctica. EPC is controlled by the body heat radiation of the penguins and their spiral-like movement in their colony. The emperor penguins in the colony seek to create the appropriate heat and regulate their body temperature, and this heat is completely coordinated and controlled by the movement of the penguins.  Momentum Balance Algorithm (MBA) (Biyanto et al. 2019)  Momentum balance is one of three fundamental \\"laws of physics\\" that states mass, energy and momentum is only conserved. The utilizations of momentum balance have been proposed in many applications. In this research momentum balance was adopted to obtain the perfectly elastic collision. In an ideal, perfectly elastic collision, there is no kinetic energy losses into other forms such as potential energy, heat and noise. The beauty of this algorithm is easy as simple as deterministic optimization algorithms, however the momentum balance algorithm has capability to reach the global optimum solution.  Shuffled Shepherd Optimization Algorithm (SSOA) (Kaveh and Zaerreza 2020)  This method is a new multi-community meta- heuristic optimization algorithm. In this algorithm,The agents are first separated into multi-communities and the optimization process is then performed mimicking the behavior of a shepherd in nature operating on each community.  A mayfly optimization algorithm (MA) (Zervoudakis & Tsafarakis 2020)  The mayfly optimization algorithm was developed to address both continuous and discrete optimization problems and is inspired from the flight behavior and the mating process of mayflies. The processes of nuptial dance and random flight enhance the balance between algorithm‚Äôs exploration and exploitation properties and assist its escape from local optima. The performance of the mayfly algorithm is superior to that of other popular metaheuristics like PSO, DE, GA and FA, in terms of convergence rate and convergence speed.  Political Optimizer (PO) (Qamar Askari, Irfan Younas & Mehreen Saeed 2020)  Political Optimizer (PO) is a human social behaviour- based algorithm inspired by a multi-party political system. The source of inspiration is formulated as a set of 5 phases: party formation and constituency allocation, party switching, election campaign, inter-party election, and parliamentary affairs. PO has two unique features: logical division of the population to assign a dual role to each candidate solution and recent-past based position updating strategy (RPPUS). PO demonstrates excellent performance against 15 well-known meta-heuristics for 50 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions and 4 engineering problems.  Heap-Based Optimizer (HBO) (Qamar Askari, Mehreen Saeed, Irfan Younas 2020)  HBO is a human social-behaviour-based meta-heuristic inspired by the corporate rank hierarchy and interaction among the employees arranged in the hierarchy. The uniqueness of HBO is the utilization of the heap data structure to model the hierarchical arrangement of the employees and the introduction of a parameter (Œ≥) to alternatively incorporate exploration and exploitation. Moreover, three equations derived for three phases of HBO are probabilistically merged to balance exploration and exploitation. HBO demonstrates tremendous performance for 97 benchmarks and 3 mechanical engineering problems.  Forensic-based investigation algorithm (FBI) (JS Chou and NM Nguyen, 2020)  The main motivation for developing a new algorithm is its capacity to effectively and efficiently solve various optimization problems. A novel optimization method, the forensic-based investigation algorithm (FBI), is developed to determine global solutions for continuous nonlinear functions with low computational effort and high accuracy. FBI is inspired by the suspect investigation‚Äìlocation‚Äìpursuit process of police officers. Main features of FBI: (1) FBI is a parameter-free optimization algorithm; (2) FBI remarkably outperformed the well-known and newly developed algorithms; (3) FBI has short computational time and rapidly reaches the optimal solutions in solving problems; (4) FBI is effective in solving high-dimensional problems (D=1000); and (5) FBI structure has two teams that well balance exploration and exploitation. Details can be found at: Chou J-S, Nguyen N-M, FBI inspired meta-optimization, Applied Soft Computing, 2020:106339, ISSN 1568-4946, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106339  Jellyfish Search (JS) (JS Chou and DN Truong, 2021)  Visualization of JS for searching the global minimum of a mathematical function. Jellyfish Search (JS) Optimizer is inspired by the behavior of jellyfish in the ocean. The simulation of the search behavior of jellyfish involves their following the ocean current, their motions inside a jellyfish swarm (active motions and passive motions), a time control mechanism for switching among these movements, and their convergences into jellyfish bloom. The new algorithm is successfully tested on benchmark functions and optimization problems. Notably, JS has only two control parameters, which are population size and number of iterations. Therefore, JS is very simple to use, and potentially an excellent metaheuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems.  Criticism of the metaphor methodology  While individual metaphor-inspired metaheuristics have produced remarkably effective solutions to specific problems,Alexander Brownlee and John R. Woodward (2015). \\"Why we fell out of love with algorithms inspired by nature\\". The Conversation. metaphor-inspired metaheuristics in general have attracted criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of effectiveness or novelty behind an elaborate metaphor.Jerry Swan, Steven Adriaensen, Mohamed Bishr, Edmund K.

The policy of Springer's journal 4OR - A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research states The emphasis on scientific rigor and on innovation implies, in particular, that the journal does not publish articles that simply propose disguised variants of known methods without adequate validation (e.g., metaheuristics that are claimed to be \\"effective\\" on the sole basis of metaphorical comparisons with natural or artificial systems and processes). New methods must be presented in metaphor-free language by establishing their relationship with classical paradigms. Their properties must be established on the basis of scientifically compelling arguments: mathematical proofs, controlled experiments, objective comparisons, etc.  See also  * Swarm intelligence#Algorithms  Notes   References    External links  *Evolutionary Computation Bestiary a tongue-in-cheek account of all the weird, even bizarre metaphor-based metaheuristics out there in the wide world of academic publishing *The Science Matrix's List of Metaheuristic a complete list of metaheuristic algorithms.

She serves as a member of the Philadelphia City Council, and is the first Asian American woman to serve in the body. A second-generation Korean-American, Gym is also a community organizer, journalist, former school teacher, and is on the board of Asian Americans United, a racial justice and advocacy group. Early life Gym was born in Seattle, Washington and raised in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio. Her parents were born in Korea and immigrated to the United States in the 1960s. Her father was a computer engineer who worked for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. Her mother worked in the food services department at the Ohio State University. Gym has a younger sister. When Gym was growing up, the family attended the Protestant Korean Church. In 1993, Gym graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where she majored in history. After leaving college, she returned to Ohio and worked for the Mansfield News Journal as a reporter. In 1994, she worked as a teacher. In 1996, Gym completed her language acquisition master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania. Career Gym has worked as a grassroots community organizer in Philadelphia has been involved in education reform there since 2006. Around that year, she co-founded the Parents United for Public Education. She is a member of the editorial board of Rethinking Schools and one of the founders of The Philadelphia Public School Notebook, a nonprofit, independent, free news service. She also co-founded a charter school in Chinatown called the Folk Art Cultural Treasures School. In 2000, Gym led a campaign called the \\"Stadium Out of Chinatown Coalition\\" against the construction of a baseball stadium north of Chinatown, due to the fear that it might result in gentrification of the area. She has also led other campaigns. In 2008, she fought against the establishment of the proposed Foxwoods Casino planned near Philadelphia's Chinatown because of the concern that unchecked development would compel longtime residents of that area to move away. She has also organized in opposition to state-sponsored, predatory gambling. In 2009, she worked on a successful federal civil rights case to help stop the bullying and harassment of Asian American students in South Philadelphia High School. The case came about partially due to a series of assaults at the school on December 3, 2009, when as many as thirty Asian immigrant students were attacked and beaten by large groups of African-American students. In her testimony, she called for the commission to require the school and district officials bear responsibility for not addressing the problem, to differentiate bias-based harassment and generalized violence, and take a different approach for each, and to develop effective anti-harassment policies and procedures. (written testimony) One result of the case was the 2014 creation of the AAPI Bullying Prevention Task Force. (\\"AAPI\\" stands for Asian American Pacific Islanders.) \\"Courtesy of Kiran Ahuja, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\\" In 2020, Gym made a cameo on Netflix's Queer Eye to advise a young activist featured on the show.https://epgn.com/2020/06/09/queer-eye-celebrates- philadelphia/https://www.tvinsider.com/gallery/queer-eye-season-5-netflix- best-moments/ Philadelphia City Council In January 2016, Gym succeeded newly elected mayor Jim Kenney as a Democratic member of the Philadelphia City Council at-large district. She ran on a platform of housing reform and education. As councilperson, she has worked to ensure that Philadelphia's communities have an equal voice to wealthy entities and lobbyists. She proposes a fair standard of living, especially for schoolchildren, and to combat hunger, lack of housing, and poverty. Following the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Gym posted on Twitter, \\"All around the country, we're fighting to remove the monuments to slavery & racism.

He has been the director of the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota since 2012. Previously, he was executive director of the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship (2008-2012, New York, New York), Dean of the School of Music at DePauw University (2006-2008, Greencastle, Indiana), Professor of Music at DePauw University (1985-2012), and Music Librarian at Old Dominion University (1983-1985; Norfolk, Virginia). DePauw University awarded him the title, Professor Emeritus of Music, in 2012.  Education  Johnson received the B.Mus. degree in 1977 with majors in Music History and Organ Performance from the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, where he studied organ with Fenner Douglas and William Porter. With a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, he studied historic performance practice from 1977-1978 at the Nordeutsche Orgelakademie (Bunderhee, Germany) with Harald VogelCleveland Johnson (ed.), Orphei Organi Antiqui. Essays in Honor of Harald Vogel. Ithaca: Westfield Center, 2006. Vogel‚Äôs early students are identified in the article, ‚ÄúHarald Vogel: Teacher‚Äù by Elizabeth Harrison, pp. 9‚Äì31. and Klaas Bolt on the historic pipe organs of East Frisia (Germany) and the Province Groningen (Netherlands). Early in his career, he introduced English-speaking scholars to the potential research value of historic organs in Ostfriesland (East Frisia) in the journal, Early Music.Cleveland Johnson, ‚ÄúA Modern Approach to the Historic Organ,‚Äù in Early Music,. vol. 8/2, April 1980, pp. 173‚Äì177. Much later, he covered this topic for The Organ: An Encyclopedia.Cleveland Johnson, ‚ÄúEms-Dollart Region,‚Äù in Douglas E. Bush, Richard Kassel (ed.): The Organ. An Encyclopedia. Routledge, New York, London 2006, pp. 170-172. On the occasion of Harald Vogel‚Äôs 65th birthday, Johnson compiled a Festschrift in his honor, Orphei Organi Antiqui. Essays in Honor of Harald Vogel,Cleveland Johnson (ed.), Orphei Organi Antiqui. Essays in Honor of Harald Vogel. Ithaca: Westfield Center, 2006. containing research by Bolt, Porter, and many former Vogel students and colleagues. To remain in close proximity to the sources of his academic research and performance, focused primarily on the organ culture of northern Europe, Johnson remained in Europe and was enrolled at Oxford University (Christ Church College) from 1978‚Äîstudying with Denis Arnold, Anthony Baines, John Caldwell, Simon Preston, and Alan Tyson, receiving the Doctor of Philosophy in Music in 1984, with a dissertation on 16th- and 17th-century organ tablatures.Cleveland Johnson, Keyboard Intabulations Preserved in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century German Organ Tablatures. A Catalogue and Commentary. (Dissertation, Oxford University, 1984). He conducted doctoral research in Germany during the years 1980-82, including a year in East Frisia, as research assistant to Harald Vogel, and a year at the University of G√∂ttingen under Wolfgang Boetticher, funded by the German Academic Exchange Service. During this period, Johnson also performed with the Groningse Bachvereiniging,Samuel Scheidt: ‚ÄúIch ruf zu dir;‚Äù from the L√ºneburger Tabulatures: ‚ÄúO Lamm Gottes,‚Äù and ‚ÄúO wir armen S√ºnden;‚Äú and (with the Groningse Bachvereniging) Christoph Demantius, Johannespassion, Groningse Bachvereniging cassette recording, 1981. specializing in historic choral performance practice, and with the baroque chamber ensemble, Fiori musicali, [directed by Thomas Albert (baroque violin), with Niklas Tr√ºstedt (viola da gamba), and Stephen Stubbs (lute)], recording for Radio Bremen and R√©creation Records.] Italienische Solomusik um 1630. R√©creation. TGS 302. 1982. LP (Works of D. Castello, G.B. Fontana, C. Merula, A. Piccinini, G. Frescobaldi). Rather than an exhaustive manuscript study of a single source, which was a common research practice of the period, Johnson‚Äôs dissertation looked broadly at a complete corpus of 58 related manuscript tablatures (as well as 9 printed tablatures) and may be considered an early example of the data-mining methodology often used in the field of Digital Humanities, made possible by early word-processor technology. This dissertation was the first digitally- produced thesis in Music at Oxford and included in the series, Outstanding Dissertations in Music from British Universities (ed.

He entered the professoriate in 1985 at DePauw University (Greencastle, Indiana), where he spent his entire teaching career, beginning as Assistant Professor in 1985, tenured as Associate Professor in 1991, promoted to full Professor in 2000, University Professor in 2007, and Professor Emeritus in 2012. Despite his organist training, he did not teach organ but spent his career in the classroom and seminar room, teaching primarily Music History, Music Appreciation, and advanced topics courses in Musicology. He was an early advocate for first-year-experience education at DePauw, and taught many years in that program‚Äîboth in January-term as well as semester-long courses, both in Music as well as non-Music topics.‚ÄúAn Approach to Integrating World Music, Improvisation, and Music History into a Single Course for First-Year Music Students‚Äù at the College Music Society, Great Lakes Chapter meeting, 2000 (Ball State University). He also brought Music into the Honors Scholar Program at DePauw, teaching a course on the ‚ÄúArt and Politics of Weimar and Nazi Germany,‚Äù examining the place of art, drama, literature, and music in the first four decades of twentieth-century Germany. During his early academic career, Johnson‚Äôs research concentrated on the historic North-European pipe organ, its literature, as well as its unique tablature notation, about which he published.Cleveland Johnson, ‚ÄúTabulatur.‚Äù in Douglas E. Bush, Richard Kassel (eds.): The Organ. An Encyclopedia (New York, London: Routledge, 2006), , pp. 555-558.Cleveland Johnson, Vocal Compositions in German Organ Tablatures, 1550-1650. A Catalogue and Commentary, in the series, Outstanding Dissertations in Music from British Universities. (New York: Garland Publishing, 1989), . He continued to leverage early digital technology for his research, such as an article on a rare, keyboard diminution manual of his discovery.Cleveland Johnson, \\"A Keyboard Diminution Manual in B√°rtfa Ms. 27: Keyboard Figuration in the Time of Scheidt\\" in Church, Stage, and Studio. Music and its Contexts in Seventeenth- Century Germany (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1990), pp. 279‚Äì347. He realized and tapped the potential of the early internet to publish a manuscript study‚Äîimpossible to present in printed-journal format‚Äîthat, using color-coded image overlays, revealed how multiple layers of music notation accreted over time in a manuscript from Samuel Scheidt or his circle of students.\\"Vocal Compositions in German Organ Tablatures, 1550-1650: A Searchable Database\\" [Online] (Seen: July 27, 2016) His interest in active- learning pedagogy and classroom technology was supported directly by grants from the Lilly Foundation and, through DePauw, with support from the Great Lakes College Association and the Mellon Foundation and DePauw‚Äôs internal Fisher Fellowships. Johnson was an early adopter of web-based technology in the university classroom. His course, ‚ÄúVirtual Vienna,‚Äù first taught in 1997, involved students in producing online content while preparing them for overseas study in Vienna, Austria. His courses in Music History and South- Asian music also involved students, already in the 1990s, in producing digital anthologies and research papers with embedded images and (later) audio and video.‚ÄúThe State of the Pipe Organ in South Asia Today‚Äù at the 2006 national convention of the American Guild of Organists (Chicago, IL).\\"The Victorian Organ in Colonial and Post-Colonial India\\" at the conference, \\"The Organ in Context\\" of the British Institute of Organ Studies, Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, England, 2003. Johnson‚Äôs work on the historic organs and literature of North Germany culminated in a recording project of six CDs for Calcante Recordings, recorded in 1996 and 1997. Having transcribed and edited Heinrich Scheidemann‚Äôs motet intablutions for Heinrichshofen Verlag,Cleveland Johnson (ed.), Heinrich Scheidemann: 12 Orgelintavolierungen, 3 vols. (Wilhelmshaven: Heinrichshofen Verlag, 1990‚Äì1993). he documented, together with the German organist, Claudia Wortman, the complete organ works of Heinrich Scheidemann, on historic German organs of the period: St. Cosmas and Damian, Stade, built by Berendt Hu√ü and Arp Schnitger from 1668‚Äì75, and St. Stephen‚Äôs, Tangerm√ºnde, completed by Hans Scherer (‚Äúthe Younger‚Äù) completed in 1624.

Online (Seen July 27, 2016) He concluded his church-music career as a professional alto in the Men and Boys Choir of Christ Church Cathedral (Indianapolis, Indiana), one of the last such choirs in the United States preserving the Anglican cathedral choral tradition.  Research in India  In 1999, the Indiana Network for the Development of India Awareness funded Johnson to take a five-week study trip to South India, where he first encountered Carnatic music. In 2001-2002 he returned to India for a sabbatical year, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities through the American Institute of Indian Studies. During that year, the first of many extended research trips, he studied the history and performance practice of the South-Asian harmonium, conducting oral interviews with the major Hindustani harmonium performers in North India, including Tulsidas Borkar, Manohar Chimote, Appa Jalgaonkar, Vidyahar Oke, and Arvind Thatte, and harmonium builders, such as Pratap Ghosh of the Dwarkin & Son company. Despite his research in the North, Johnson lived in the southern city of Chennai, studying carnatic singing and participating in the 155th Tyagaraja Aradhana in Thiruvaiyaru. As a visiting Western scholar, he was also invited to perform an inventory of the British-era pipe organs in Chennai for the Church of South India and, through his presentations on this topic to the British Institute of Organ Studies and the American Guild of Organists, helped attract support to restore several historic instruments in Chennai, including the organs in St. Mary‚Äôs Church of Fort St. George, Chennai, and St. Andrew‚Äôs Church, Chennai.‚ÄúThe State of the Pipe Organ in South Asia Today‚Äù at the 2006 national convention of the American Guild of Organists (Chicago, IL)\\"The Victorian Organ in Colonial and Post-Colonial India\\" at the 2003 conference, \\"The Organ in Context\\" of the British Institute of Organ Studies, Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, England. He also served as a consulting advisor for the foundation of the KM Music Conservatory in Chennai, launched by A.R. Rahman in 2008, and recruited several early faculty members. His time in India led to a complete shift in his research and teaching interests. At DePauw University, he brought the teaching of a non- Western music tradition into the curriculum for the first time. With funding from the ASIANetwork, in 2003-2004, he involved a small team of DePauw School of Music studentsDePauw University, \\"DePauw Students & Professor Return from Research Project in South India.\\" Online (Seen July 27, 2016) in a digital- humanities project in Chennai, India, gathering data from over 2400 compositions in almost 300 live concerts during the Madras Music Season, revealing the relatively small number of ragas actually used in performance from among the thousands of theoretically-possible ragas.

He was executive director during the Great Recession in the United States, and oversaw a needed reduction in the number of Watson- affiliated colleges and universities. At the end of his term, he assembled previous Watson directors to evaluate how the fellowship program had evolved during more than four decades of serial leadership.

Polyomaviruses in which it occurs include two human polyomaviruses associated with disease, BK virus and JC virus, as well as the simian polyomavirus SV40. Sequence and structure Agnoprotein is typically quite short: examples from BK virus, JC virus, and SV40 are 62, 71, and 66 amino acid residues long, respectively. Among other known polyomavirus genomes with a predicted agnogene, the length of the resulting predicted protein varies considerably, from as short as 30 to as long as 154 residues. It contains a highly hydrophobic central amino acid sequence, a \\"bipartite\\" nuclear localization sequence at the N-terminus, and highly basic amino acids at both termini. Comparison of the sequences of different viral agnoproteins suggests sequence conservation toward the N-terminus with greater variability toward the C-terminus. Formation of amphipathic alpha helices under laboratory conditions has been demonstrated for part of the sequence believed to have a role in mediating dimerization and oligomerization of the protein. The BK, JC, and SV40 agnoproteins have all been experimentally demonstrated to be phosphorylated in vivo, which appears to improve both protein stability and viral propagation, but no other post-translational modifications have been detected. Expression A map of the genome of JC virus, indicating the position of the agnogene (yellow) in the late region relative to the other coding genes and to the non-coding control region (NCCR). Agnoprotein is expressed from a region of the circular viral genome called the agnogene, an open reading frame contained in a region of the polyomavirus genome that codes for the viral capsid proteins and is known as the \\"late region\\" because it is expressed late in the cycle of viral infection and replication. The agnogene and its protein product received their name (from the Greek agnosis, \\"without knowledge\\") because the presence of the open reading frame and corresponding RNA was detected before the existence of the protein product was confirmed. Cellular localization Agnoprotein is consistently detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells, with particularly high concentrations in the perinuclear space. It is also detectable in the cell nucleus; in the case of JC virus, nuclear-localized agnoprotein comprises 15‚Äì20% of the total agnoprotein expressed.  Function  Agnoprotein is a regulatory protein required for efficient proliferation of the viruses in which it is present, although many polyomaviruses do not have the gene. Its functions are poorly characterized even in well-studied viruses. Null mutant viruses without agnoprotein are generally either incapable of proliferation or are vastly impaired; some such mutants can produce virions, but they may be deficient in exiting the host cell or lack appropriately packaged genetic material. Agnoprotein null mutants can successfully proliferate if agnoprotein is present in trans. Although the protein is not found in mature virions, there is some evidence that it can be secreted from infected cells, even before viral exit, and taken up by neighboring uninfected cells. Agnoprotein has been associated with a number of processes in the viral life cycle, including transcription, replication, and encapsidation of the viral genome. It has also been suggested that agnoprotein functions as a viroporin ‚Äì that is, a viral protein that alters membrane permeability to facilitate the virus particles' exit from the cell. In addition, effects on the behavior of the host cell itself have been observed, including impaired progression through the cell cycle and deficiencies in DNA repair. Because it is highly basic, agnoprotein has been suspected to be a DNA-binding protein, but has not been shown to bind DNA. A large number of protein-protein interactions have been reported between agnoprotein and other proteins of both viral and host cell origin. Agnoprotein interacts with the viral proteins small tumor antigen and large tumor antigen as well as with the capsid protein VP1. Host cell proteins reported as binding partners for at least one virus species' agnoprotein include p53, Ku70, PP2A, YB-1, FEZ1, HP1Œ±, Œ±-SNAP, PCNA, and AP-3. In some cases, the agnogene itself has functional significance, even if it cannot express agnoprotein. Deletion of the nucleotides in this region has been associated with a variant JC virus capable of infecting cell types not normally targeted by this virus. This variant has been associated with a disease recently described from case reports called JC virus encephalopathy, distinct from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which has long been associated with JC in immunocompromised individuals. Evolution Although agnoprotein is critical for proliferation in the polyomaviruses in which it occurs, its distribution among polyomaviruses whose genomes have been sequenced is patchy. It has been well studied in three viruses that infect mammalian hosts, including two human viruses ‚Äì BK virus and JC virus ‚Äì and the simian virus SV40; the BK, JC, and SV40 examples are by far the best-studied and have fairly high sequence conservation. Additional predicted agnogenes have been identified from the sequenced genomes of other polyomaviruses, and the predicted protein products vary considerably in length and have low sequence identity overall. The distribution of agnoprotein among polyomaviruses has prompted speculation that there is little evolutionary selection pressure in favor of its presence. Among sequenced BK virus genomes, agnoprotein is the most variable viral protein in amino acid sequence. Differences in tissue tropism and in viral life cycle, particularly in viral exit from the host cell, have also been proposed as explanations for the presence or absence of agnoprotein in various human polyomaviruses. Avian polyomaviruses A gene occurs in avian polyomaviruses in a similar genomic position and was originally annotated as an agnogene, but it has no detectable sequence similarity to the mammalian examples. The protein product of this gene has been detected in the capsids of mature virions, leading to its reclassification as VP4 to reflect its distinct role as a structural protein. However, it is still often referred to as \\"avian agnoprotein 1a\\".

The nephews, Efra√≠n Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were arrested on 10 November 2015 by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration in Port- au-Prince, Haiti after attempting to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. A year later on 18 November 2016, the two nephews were found guilty, with the cash allegedly destined to \\"help their family stay in power\\". On 14 December 2017, the two were sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment. Etymology The word Narcosobrinos is the word narco, meaning \\"drug dealer\\", followed by sobrinos, which translates to \\"nephews\\". Its translation could therefore be \\"drug dealer nephews\\". The term derived from the media which focused on the relation of drug dealing allegations to President Maduro's nephews. Background Aircraft activity of drug trafficking suspects primarily from Venezuela tracked by the United States Southern Command showing multiple drug flights to Haiti. According to Jackson Diehl, Deputy Editorial Page Editor of The Washington Post, the Bolivarian government of Venezuela shelters \\"one of the world's biggest drug cartels\\". There have been allegations of former president Hugo Ch√°vez being involved with drug trafficking. In May 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported from United States officials that drug trafficking in Venezuela increased significantly with Colombian drug traffickers moving from Colombia to Venezuela due to pressure from law enforcement. One United States Department of Justice official described the higher ranks of the Venezuelan government and military as \\"a criminal organization\\", with high ranking Venezuelan officials being accused of drug trafficking. Those involved with investigations stated that Venezuelan government defectors and former traffickers had given information to investigators and that details of those involved in government drug trafficking were increasing. Anti-drug authorities have also accused some Venezuelan officials of working with Mexican drug cartels. At a presentation at the XXXII International Conference on Drugs in 2015, commander of the United States Southern Command General John Kelly stated that though relations with other Latin American nations countering drug trafficking has been good, Venezuela was not as cooperative and that \\"there's a lot of cocaine leaving Venezuela to the world market\\". General Kelly also stated that almost all shipments of cocaine using aircraft comes out of Venezuela and that since 2013 to early-2014, the route of drug trafficking aircraft has changed from heading to Central America to primarily traveling through Caribbean islands. The Narcosobrinos incident happened at a time when multiple high-ranking members of the Venezuelan government were being investigated for their involvement of drug trafficking, including Walter Jacobo Gavidia, Cilia Flores' son who is a Caracas judge, former National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, and Governor of Aragua State Tarek El Aissami. Series of events Preparation and DEA monitoring Campo Flores and Flores de Freitas were allegedly involved in illicit activities such as drug trafficking and possibly financially assisted President Maduro's presidential campaign in the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election and potentially for the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections. One informant stated that the two would often fly out of Terminal 4 of Simon Bolivar Airport, a terminal reserved for the president. Eight pages of messages between the nephews detailing the murder and dismemberment of an indebted individual The nephews and DEA informants met on multiple occasions in Haiti, Honduras and Venezuela while every meeting \\"produced an audio recording plus three to seven videos\\". Campo and Flores planned to ship cocaine supplied by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to the United States and sought for assistance with their plans. On 3 October 2015, a confidential DEA informant known as CW-1 and his employee \\"El Flaco\\" were contacted by a Venezuelan contact known as \\"Hamudi\\" who introduced Campo and Flores to the informant.Campo and Flores seen showing the purity of drugs in a secret video during a 27 October 2015 meeting in Caracas, Venezuela with DEA informants. The next day on 4 October 2015, the two flew from Venezuela to San Pedro Sula, Honduras, with nephews stating that they would use their connections to send narcotics on legal flights from Caracas, Venezuela to Roat√°n, Honduras, knowing that their relation to the president \\"would open doors for the smuggling operation\\". Photos from Campo's phone showing two firearms and an AT4 rocket launcher. In late-October, CS-1, who presented himself as a Mexican drug boss and CS-2, presenting himself as an associate of CS-1, flew to Caracas, Venezuela to meet with the nephews. Around 23 October 2015, CS-1 and CS-2 met with the nephews, with Campo stating that he was \\"the one in charge\\" and that \\"we're at war with the United States ... with Colombia ... with the opposition\\". Campo also reassured the two informants that the cocaine shipments would not be tracked by law enforcement because the plane would \\"depart from here as if ... some from our family were on the plane\\". Days later on 26 October 2015, Campo stated that the two were to ship cocaine and were seeking to raise about $20 million, explaining that CW-1 would be paid about $900,000 to receive the cocaine in Honduras. The next day on 27 October 2015, Campo and Flores presented a kilogram of cocaine to CS-1 and CS-2 to show its purity, with the informants believing that the purity was between 95%-97%. On 5 November 2015, informant CS-3 met with co-defendant Roberto de Jesus Soto Garcia to plan on how to receive the cocaine in Honduras. Soto explained the schedule at the Juan Manuel G√°lvez International Airport in Roat√°n, Honduras and stated that the load of cocaine would then be \\"arranged with all of those inside of the airport\\". Arrests =Campo Flores and Flores de Freites= Cessna Citation 500 private jet registered as YV2030 in Venezuela that flew Campos and Flores into Haiti on 10 November 2015. On 10 November 2015, Campo Flores and Flores de Freites were flown into Port-au- Prince, Haiti by two Venezuelan military personnel accompanied by two presidential honor guards carrying more than 800 kilograms of cocaine destined for New York City. The jet was a Cessna Citation 500 that belonged to Lebanese Venezuelan businessmen Majed and Khaled Khalil Majzoun, who were linked to old projects of the Hugo Ch√°vez government and close to high ranking Venezuelan politician Diosdado Cabello. CS-1 met with the nephews at a restaurant of a hotel near Toussaint Louverture International Airport and was supposed to pay them $5 million for the cocaine. CS-1 then left into the bathroom and the Haitian Brigade de Lutte contre le Trafic de Stup√©fiants (BLTS) and DEA agents raided the restaurant after identifying themselves, apprehending the nephews. The BLTS personnel wore fatigues and vests that read \\"POLICE\\" so they would be able to be identified as well. Campos and Flores were later turned over to the DEA and read their Miranda rights after boarding the DEA plane, being flown directly to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, New York in order to face an immediate trial. The two were interviewed separately on the DEA plane. Campo stated on the DEA plane that he was the adopted step son of President Maduro and that he grew up in the Maduro household while being raised by Flores. He was also shown a picture of a man with a kilo package of cocaine replying \\"That's me\\" and when asked what was in the package he said \\"You know what it is\\". The two men possessed Venezuelan diplomatic passports but did not have diplomatic immunity according to former head of DEA international operations Michael Vigil. A later raid of Efra√≠n Antonio Campo Flores' \\"Casa de Campo\\" mansion and yacht in the Dominican Republic revealed an additional 280 lbs of cocaine and 22 lbs of heroin, with 176 lbs of the drugs found in the home while the remainder was discovered in his yacht. Due to the extradition process, New York courts could not apprehend those who assisted the nephews on their way to Haiti, though a pilot was later arrested. It was also stated by those close to the case that there are more sealed warrants linked to the incident. =Roberto de Jes√∫s Soto Garc√≠a= On 28 October 2016, a Honduran man, Roberto de Jes√∫s Soto Garc√≠a, was arrested in Honduras and extradited to the United States. According to authorities, Soto Garc√≠a was responsible for transporting drug shipments from Juan Manuel G√°lvez International Airport. Soto Garc√≠a allegedly provided information about the port and was supposed to take the drugs from the nephews into the United States. =Aircraft pilot= In June 2016, Yazenky Antonio Lamas Rond√≥n, the pilot of the plane which transported the cocaine and the two nephews, was arrested at the El Dorado International Airport in Bogota, Colombia after the DEA and Interpol put out a warrant for his arrest. According to the DEA, Lamas Rond√≥n piloted over 100 flights over the span of a decade from Venezuela which trafficked various drugs throughout Latin America. He is also believed to be involved with the Cartel of the Suns, a group of corrupt drug trafficking Venezuelan officials. Trial The nephews originally plead not guilty to the charges of conspiring to transport cocaine into the United States, with the two facing up to life in prison. In trial papers filed on 1 July 2016, the nephews stated that they were not informed of their rights when detained, attempting to suppress their statements that they made to DEA agents after their arrest. However, on 22 July 2016, their statements made to DEA agents were filed as exhibit by the United States Attorney Office in Manhattan, with the two men confessing to their conspiracy to traffic cocaine into the United States that was supposed to be supplied by the Colombian guerilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The pair hoped to make $20 million through multiple drug shipments. A confidential informant posing as a leader of the Sinaloa cartel confessions testified that Efrain Campo planned to finance Cilia Flores' congressional campaign. On 18 November 2016, the jury reached a verdict finding the two nephews guilty of attempting to traffic drugs into the United States. =Murdered informants= Campo and Flores meeting with CW-1 who was confined to a wheelchair. Two informants that allegedly observed the nephews were murdered shortly before and after their arrest, raising concerns that the drug trafficking operation was larger that suspected. Two weeks before the nephews were arrested, the Venezuelan known as \\"Hamudi\\" who introduced the nephews to CW-1 was murdered by FARC suppliers. Weeks after the arrests in December 2015, CW-1 was murdered as well. It is thought to be that the nephews were not \\"the brains\\" of the trafficking attempt but were working under the Cartel of the Suns. The murdering of informants was a possible way to cover possible involvement by Venezuelan officials. In the United States, the punishment for killing a witness is a federal offense punishable by up to life in prison or execution. Media coverage International media focused on the events surrounding the nephews and their trial while Venezuelan media was largely censored from revealing that the two were related to the President Maduro and his wife. Venezuelan media organizations like Globovisi√≥n and √öltimas Noticias only mentioned that \\"two Venezuelans\\" were charged with drug trafficking without showing any relation to the president's family, raising accusations of self-censorship. Social media, which is popular in Venezuela, was used by journalists as a way to allow Venezuelans to bypass censorship and provide updates about the situation surrounding the president's nephews. Reactions Academics and scholars According to drug trafficking expert, Bruce Bagley of the University of Miami, \\"The nephews are just the tip of the iceberg ... Corruption is rampant in power circles in Venezuela. This case suggests a culture that drug trafficking is routine and daily fare for someone with contacts in the presidential palace\\", with Bagley further stating that \\"With their connections, they felt they would skate through ... They made a mistake because when the DEA heard their names they targeted them.\\" Government of Venezuela After Maduro's nephews were apprehended by the DEA for the illegal distribution of cocaine on 10 November 2015, Maduro posted a statement on Twitter criticizing \\"attacks and imperialist ambushes\\" which was viewed by many media outlets as being directed towards the United States. President Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, accused the United States of kidnapping her nephews and said that she had proof that they were kidnapped by the DEA. Diosdado Cabello, a senior official in Maduro's government who has been accused of drug trafficking himself, was also quoted as saying the arrests were a \\"kidnapping\\" by the United States. Roberto de Jes√∫s Soto Garcia, a Honduran man who provided assistance to the smugglers, has been linked to Venezuela's Vice President Tareck El Aissami. Following the arrest of the nephews, Associated Press correspondent Hannah Dreier was detained by SEBIN agents. She was then interrogated, being threatened with being beheaded in a way like ISIL did to James Foley, saying they would release her for a kiss. They later stated that they wanted to exchange Dreier for President Maduro's nephews.

Retrieved August 15, 2016 It was developed in collaboration with Gerard Way, an American musician and comic book writer, author of The Umbrella Academy. Its main focus is to relaunch characters and settings from the DC Universe in stories for mature readers, done with a more experimental approach than DC's primary line of superhero comics. The line has been overseen by Vertigo group editor Jamie S. Rich and executive editor Mark Doyle. Gerard Way has said that a shared theme of the Young Animal comics is \\"relationships between parents and children.\\" Other themes he has cited are alienation, fame, change (\\"self- actualization and becoming something else\\"), as well as bullying, teenagers and drug use (in Shade, the Changing Girl), and eventually \\"a lot of personal stuff for me in Doom Patrol that deals with mature themes\\".  History  The imprint launched in late 2016 with four ongoing series: Doom Patrol, Shade the Changing Girl, Cave Carson Has a Cybernetic Eye, and Mother Panic; followed in 2017 by a 6-issue limited series Bug! The Adventures of Forager. In the middle of 2018 was a five-part crossover involving members of the Justice League, which was called Milk Wars. Three of the series were then relaunched as Shade the Changing Woman, Cave Carson Has an Interstellar Eye, and Mother Panic: Gotham A.D., running for 6 issues under those names, along with the new title Eternity Girl, which also ran for 6 issues. The line was placed on hold in August 2018, with the 12th issue of the delayed Doom Patrol series going on sale the following October. In April 2019, DC announced that Doom Patrol would resume in July, and would then be joined by two new titles.  Titles  * Shade, the Changing Girl ‚Äì by Cecil Castellucci and Marley Zarcone ‚Äì is based on the earlier Vertigo series Shade, the Changing Man. It is about an alien who is obsessed with a discontinued line of missions to Earth using a \\"Madness Cloak\\". She takes and uses it, and becomes stuck on Earth, waking up in the body of a girl, a high school bully who had been in a coma after nearly drowning in a lake. * Mother Panic ‚Äì by Jody Houser and Tommy Lee Edwards ‚Äì is about Violet Paige, a temperate young celebrity whom no one suspects to be keeping gigantic secrets from everyone, who seeks revenge on her privileged peers. She operates in Gotham City and is often monitored by Batman and the Bat Family. * Doom Patrol ‚Äì by Gerard Way and Nick Derington ‚Äì is another series from DC featuring \\"freak\\" heroes. The protagonist is Casey Brinke, an EMT who can only remember impossible things from her childhood. She is introduced into Dannyland, a seemingly impossible place that has the answers to her past and her future. * Cave Carson Has a Cybernetic Eye ‚Äì by Jon Rivera, Gerard Way, and Michael Avon Oeming ‚Äì is a revival of DC's underground explorer Cave Carson.

The novel follows Caxton's journey of discovery into her own family's past and the living conditions of Australia's original inhabitants. Reviews Writing in The Canberra Times Jean Battersby found that \\"Miss Cusack enters the fight with courage, sympathy and indignation, but without very much subtlety or skill...Art, properly exploited, is probably the most powerful ally of the social critic, for it allows objective argument to be translated into direct emotional experience. But its disciples must be observed ... its special ways of making points, its dependence on balance and proportion. If they are not, it easily degenerates into pleading and propaganda, which tend to defeat their own ends, discrediting their cause by the methods which they use.

It was considered to be a \\"sister\\" division to the 413th, and was one of the divisions of Siberians sent west to help defend Moscow during the winter of 1941-42. It spent much of the next year in the same general area, west of the capital, taking part in the mostly futile battles against the German-held salient at Rzhev during late 1942. Following the evacuation of the salient in March, 1943 the 415th was assigned to the 61st Army, where it remained for most of the rest of the war. It took part in the summer offensives through western Russia and into eastern Belarus during the fall and winter, earning a battle honor in January, 1944. During the later stages of the next summer offensive, Operation Bagration, it distinguished itself in the liberation of Pinsk and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Following this it was redeployed northward, still in 61st Army, and took part in the offensives through the Baltic states. In the spring of 1945 the division also earned the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its part in the capture of several towns in northeastern Germany. The 415th had a distinguished career as a combat unit, ending its combat path near Berlin, but was disbanded in the summer of 1945.  Formation  The 415th Rifle Division began forming on September 8, 1941 at Vladivostok, in 25th Army on the Pacific coast. It appears to have begun forming as the \\"Voroshilov\\" Rifle Division before being assigned a divisional number.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 82 Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 1321st Rifle Regiment * 1323rd Rifle Regiment * 1326th Rifle Regiment * 686th Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Georgii Aleksandrovich Latyshev was appointed to command on the day the division began forming. It was considered to be ready for combat by the end of October, and shipped out to the west as part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in the first days of November. It was one of six divisions transferred from Far Eastern Front to the fighting front from September to November. Contrary to the German understanding at the time, there were no wholesale transfers from the far east to the Moscow front.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, pp. 82-83 Prior to this move Colonel Latyshev left his command on November 1. Until mid-1943 this position would see a high rate of turnover, as follows: * Maj. Gen. Pyotr Andreevich Aleksandrov (November 2, 1941 - March 2, 1942) * Lt. Col. Grigorii Ivanovich Kanachadze (March 3 - April 22, 1942) * Col. Nikolai Ivanovich Tuzov (April 23 - May 9, 1942) * Lt. Col. Nikolai Alexeevich Krymskii (May 10 - June 12, 1942) * Col.

Nikolai Kuzmich Maslennikov (June 26 - July 30, 1943)  Battle of Moscow  The 415th was first assigned to 49th Army in Western Front, along with the 7th Guards Rifle Division, on November 10 in order to strengthen that Army's right flank. Beginning on November 14 these right-flank forces, along with the 2nd Cavalry Corps and the 112th Tank Division, fought a series of meeting engagements with German forces attempting to capture Serpukhov. The German attack was stymied at the cost of significant losses and a week later the Soviet units went over to the defensive. The division was specifically assigned to defend the sector from Sidorenki to Burinovskii station and prevent German tanks and infantry from breaking through in the direction of Burinovo and Kalugino. General Aleksandrov was ordered to prepare antitank strongpoints near Terekhun, the wooded area east of Burinovo, in the woods near Burinovskii station, Stanki station and near Kalugino; in addition a switch position was to be constructed along the northern bank of the Nara River along the sector from Dubrovka to Butyrki and a rear position along a line from Shakhlovo to Kalugino. The front-line defenses were to be completed by December 1, with the second-line positions completed by December 5.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow 1941-1942, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 5 As of December 7, as the left wing of Western Front was preparing to go over to the counteroffensive, 49th Army had 5 rifle divisions (5th Guards, 415th, 60th, 194th and 238th) with 350 field and antitank guns, deployed on a 70 km-wide front. The 415th, on the Army's right (north) flank, faced the 137th Infantry Division east of Vysokinichi. The Army was to go over to a general offensive on the morning of December 16, largely with its left wing forces while the 5th Guards and 60th Divisions were to launch a supporting attack and the 415th was to tie down the German division with limited attacks to prevent reserves being transferred to the south. When the offensive began it faced resistance everywhere particularly on the right flank. 5th Guards and 60th made very little progress, while the left flank reached and crossed the Oka River by the 19th. On the same day the 415th and 5th Guards were ordered to continue their tying-down operations. During December 20‚Äì22 the division was defending with two regiments of the 60th along the line from Burinovskii station to the woods north of Ostrov. On December 24 it went over to the offensive and, operating in individual detachments, began slowly moving forward as German resistance weakened. By the morning of the 26th it reached a line from Kurkino to Troyanovo to Makarovo before again running into stubborn German resistance. On December 28 it liberated Makarovo and continued attacking to the west.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 The 415th encountered the heaviest resistance along the Alozha River about 1 km west of Makarovo and after forcing a crossing its offensive developed more successfully. It took the village of Chernaya Gryaz with elements of the 60th Division and by the morning of December 30 had reached a line 5 km west of that village and continued advancing. The next day by order of Western Front the division was transferred to the adjacent 43rd Army, where it would remain until July. From January 1‚Äì9, 1942 the 415th cooperated with the 194th Rifle Division of 49th Army in overcoming German minefields and other obstacles and pressing on, reaching and capturing the villages of Afonasovo and Starosele on January 4, after which the 194th was also re-subordinated to 43rd Army. These left flank units, backed by the 18th Tank Brigade, were directed on Maloyaroslavets, which had been liberated on January 2.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 On January 9 the 43rd Army issued orders to continue the offensive towards Medyn and Myatlevo. The objective was to \\"encircle and destroy the Kondrovo-Yukhnov-Medyn enemy group and develop the blow to the northwest.\\" The Army was directed be fighting for the Medyn area by the end of January 10 and have possession of Myatlevo 24 hours later, and committed an airborne corps, four rifle divisions and two tank brigades to the effort. Given earlier losses, this amounted to about 15,000 infantry and sappers, 400 machine guns, about 100 mortars, 50 guns and up to 40 tanks. They faced the remnants of 29th Motorized and 10th Panzer Divisions covering the withdrawal of the XX Army Corps. On the first day the 415th reached Stanki where German forces resisted stubbornly. The advance continued on January 12 and during the next day the 5th Airborne encircled the garrison in Medyn, which broke out in small groups overnight towards Myatlevo with the loss of about 2,000 men and substantial equipment. As of January 15 the division was fighting unsuccessfully for the villages of Bogdanovo and Ivanishchevo along the Shanya River and the Army's drive bogged down along this line. As a result of several regroupings in an effort to surround the village by January 21 the division was the only one remaining facing Myatlovo. By this time the German forces were making more serious efforts to break out of their encirclement in the Yukhnov area. The capture of Myatlevo was vital to get into the retreating Germans' flank and rear, but the 415th was insufficient to the task. It was therefore reinforced with the 1st Guards Motorized Rifle Division from 33rd Army. A methodical attack brought the division to the approaches to the village on January 27, when the 1st Guards arrived. In the final attack plan the 415th was to demonstrate an envelopment from the left flank as a distraction, allowing the 1st Guards to mount a quick frontal blow and break in. The attack went according to plan and Myatlevo was in Soviet hands by 0400 hours on January 29. The division was left to mop up the German remnants while the 1st Guards pursued along the Warsaw highway.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 9 While the winter offensive had served to eliminate the immediate threat to Moscow, the cost to the Red Army was high. By January, the character of the 415th as a Siberian unit had changed. Due to the influx of casualty replacements the division was noted in this month as being 70 percent Georgian.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 Battles for Rzhev The 415th was transferred to 20th Army, still in Western Front, in July, along the eastern face of the Rzhev Salient, then to the adjoining 29th Army in November,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 144, 236 but in the last gasps of Operation Mars in December the division was ordered back to the 20th to help make one last desperate attempt to break the German positions and capture Sychyovka. On December 11 the relatively-fresh 415th made an attack on a 4 km front between Bolshoe Kropotovo and Zherebtsovo alongside the 243rd, 247th and 30th Guards Rifle Divisions in the first echelon. The 415th, attacking in the Maloe Kropotovo and Podosinovka sectors, would be backed by the re-formed 6th Tank Corps with 100 tanks in two brigades to exploit once the division breached the German line. At 1100 hours the 22nd Tank Brigade, attacking in the wake of the division, penetrated west of Maloe Kropotovo but came under heavy German fire which stripped away the accompanying riflemen and knocked out about 25 tanks. The combined forces of the rifle divisions made scanty gains of 500 - 1,000 metres at significant cost, and failed to capture a single German-held fortified village. Three days later, the offensive was shut down for good.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 253, 256, 263-64 In the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 692 men killed and 1,865 wounded, for a total of 2,557 casualties.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 90 Into Western Russia and Belarus In March, as the Soviet forces prepared for the 1943 summer campaign, the 415th was shifted south to the 61st Army in Bryansk Front;Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 85 it would remain in this Army for most of the rest of the war. The Soviet offensive against the German-held salient centered on the city of Oryol began with limited, local reconnaissance thrusts on July 11 with the full assault beginning the next day, just as Hitler was deciding to shut down Operation Citadel. Following a three-hour artillery preparation three armies of Bryansk Front, including the 61st, plus the 11th Guards Army of Western Front, attacked against three sectors on the northern flank of the salient. 61st Army was still on the Bolkhov sector, now facing the German 208th Infantry Division with four rifle divisions in the first echelon. By evening the Soviet troops had managed to advance 5‚Äì6 km. 11th Guards Army made much more substantial progress in the early going and on July 18 the Soviet command committed the fresh 25th Tank Corps into that Army's sector at Ulyanovo but instead of driving into the open gap between two German army corps most of the 25th Tank was directed towards Bolkhov, which was still in German hands until it was liberated, mostly by units of 61st Army, on July 28. On the same day Gen. W. Model gave the order for his combined 2nd Panzer and 9th Armies to prepare to withdraw to the Hagen position at the base of the salient. In mid- August the forces of Bryansk Front attempted to break through to Karachev but only succeeded after the German forces withdrew further west. On August 18 their withdrawal to the Hagen line was completed.Roman T√∂ppel, Kursk 1943: The Greatest Battle of the Second World War, Helion & Co., Ltd., Warwick, UK, 2018, Kindle ed., ch. 2, sect. Operation Kutuzov Shortly after Bolkhov was taken the 415th was subordinated to the 46th Rifle CorpsCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 190 and on August 1 Col. Pavel Ivanovich Moshchalkov took over command of the division, where he would remain for the duration of the war.Commanders of Corps and Divisions in the Great Patriotic War, p. 295; see Bibliography Later that month the 415th was reassigned to 89th Rifle Corps, and was advancing on Bryansk in the late summer before the entire 61st Army was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command by the beginning of September. By the start of the next month it had been moved once again to Central FrontCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 235, 249 as the campaign moved into Belarus. In late September the Army arrived along the Dniepr River on a broad front extending from Loev to south of Liubech, but the 89th Corps was unable to gain any footholds on the west bank due to strong German resistance and well-organized artillery and mortar fire. In preparation for the Gomel - Rechitsa Offensive Central Front underwent a major regrouping from October 8‚Äì14, during which 89 Corps was redeployed into new positions south of Liubech. However, it was the other two corps of 61st Army, (29th Rifle Corps and 9th Guards Rifle Corps) which were to form the shock group when the offensive began on October 22. In heavy fighting over the next week the Soviet attackers forced elements of German 2nd Army to make a phased withdrawal to new positions in the rear and advanced as much as 20 km, but neither of the primary objectives were taken.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 28, 99, 106, 116-17 On October 25 the 415th and its corps-mate the 336th Rifle Division were reassigned to the 28th Rifle Corps of 13th Army in 1st Ukrainian Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 278 in which it crossed the Dniepr and took part in the battles that liberated Kiev in November. As a result of this fighting the division had to be replenished with what the Germans called \\"booty Ukrainians\\"; for example, on December 17 the 415th received 550 new riflemen of all ages from Kiev and Zhitomir, with less than two months training in the 21st Reserve Regiment stationed at Chernobyl.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 115 Kalinkovichi-Mozyr Offensive In early January, 1944, the 415th returned to 61st Army, now in Belorussian Front. Planning was already underway for a new offensive in the direction of Kalinkovichi and Mozyr by the 61st and 65th Armies, with the 61st advancing along the swampy banks of the Pripyat River. It faced the 292nd and 102nd Infantry Divisions and Corps Detachment E of German XX Army Corps, all of which were significantly under strength from earlier losses. The 415th was deployed south of the Pripyat on the Army's left (south) flank opposite Corps Detachment E which held the extreme southern flank of Army Group Center. The division screened the regrouping of the 2nd and 7th Guards Cavalry Corps from the north; the cavalry was to advance through terrain thought to be impassable and outflank the German detachment. The 61st Army's main offensive began at dawn on January 8 after a 45-minute artillery preparation, but soon ran into stiff German resistance. Meanwhile, the 415th, in cooperation with local partisans, opened a gap on the German flank allowing the two cavalry corps and begin a raid deep into the rear in the direction of Mozyr.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 418-19, 421-22, 426, 438, 440 Over the first two days the cavalry advanced as much as 75 km and rendered Corps Detachment E's positions utterly untenable. The STAVKA perceived an opportunity to smash the entire right flank of German 2nd Army and ordered the operation accelerated. As a result, the Front commander, Army Gen. K. K.

However, at the start of Operation Bagration the Army was in 1st Belorussian Front and the 415th was a separate division in that Army. 61st Army was part of the Front's western group of armies, still facing the German 2nd Army along the southern fringes of the Pripyat Marshes, and did not play an active role in the first phase of the offensive, acting as a follow-on force as the Germans retreated.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 209-10 Before dawn on June 29 the Dniepr Flotilla's 2nd Brigade of river cutters landed forces of the 55th Rifle Division across the Pripyat River. Its bridgehead was broadened by the 23rd Rifle Division in subsequent landings. On July 3 the 415th, 397th and 212th Rifle Divisions attacked in support, but were unsuccessful. The Army's offensive on the Pinsk axis resumed on July 4 supported by several partisan detachments, fortified regions and the 55th Guards Rifle Division of 28th Army and began rolling up the German defenses along the northern bank of the Pripyat, Goryn and Styr rivers. In danger of encirclement, the German grouping was falling back to the west before the Army's right flank and center but was otherwise stubbornly defending the approaches to Luninets and Pinsk. By the end of July 9 the Army had advanced 85 km in five days and had reached the approaches to Luninets.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R. W.

The city had been well fortified with full trenches, pillboxes and engineering obstacles. The outer line was held by the 216th Divisional Group and three worker battalions while the city itself was occupied by remnants of the 35th Infantry Division and the 17th Special Designation Brigade. On the night of July 13/14 the Army made a turning maneuver to attack the city from the north, south and east, with the help of the Dniepr Flotilla, and crushed German resistance, clearing the center by 0600 hours. By the end of July 16 it reached the line Khomsk to Ogdemer to Zhuravok, resulting in an advance of another 60 km over four days.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, pt. 1, ch. 10 For its role in the liberation of Pinsk the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on July 23, while the 1323rd (Maj.

The Army was to launch its main attack with its left flank, forcing the river along a 2.5 km sector from Hohenwutzow to Neuglitzen. The 415th was one of six divisions, including the rest of 9th Guards and the 89th Rifle Corps, grouped along the axis of the main attack. Within its Corps, the division was in the second echelon while the 75th and 12th Guards were in first echelon. Although the main offensive began on April 16, 61st Army did not attack until the next day, when it won a bridgehead 3 km wide and up to 1,000m deep. By the 22nd the Army had cleared the Oder and Alte Oder and had turned its front completely to the north; three days later it had reached points 55 km west of the Oder. On April 29 it forced the Havel River in the area of Zehdenick against minimal resistance. Finally, on May 2, having advanced 60 km during the day against no resistance, it reached the Elbe River in the area of Havelberg, and the next day met up with elements of the U.S. 84th Infantry Division near Gnefsdorf.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation, 1945, ed. & trans.

Known only from a few teeth, its affinities with other mammal groups remain unresolved. Description Yingabalanara is known from two lower right molar teeth. The chewing surface of the tooth has two overlapping crescent-like cusps (hence the animal's name). Due to the sheer bizarreness of the teeth it's not entirely clear to which normal molar structures these cusps correspond to, being variously interpreted as talonids, trigonids or other cusps. The molars are double-rooted, and possess what appears to be a remnant cingulid. The overall proportions seem to suggest an animal about the size of a rat, and the tooth morphology is consistent with omnivorous habits. However, for obvious reasons the animal's overall appearance and morphology are unknown. Etymology Yingabalanara is a Wanyi word meaning \\"two moons\\", in reference to the mammal's crescent-like cusps. The word is masculine in gender, as befitting the status of the predominantly masculine Australian lunar deities. The species name is an homage to Graham Richardson, a \\"Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and the Arts\\". Phylogeny Yingabalanara's molars are exceptionally unusual among mammals, rendering its exact relations as controversial. Its bizarre cusps differ radically from the normal conditions seen in marsupials and placentals (though there are vague similarities to phyllostomid bats), and while slightly similar to the teeth of monotremes and other yinotheres the longer and narrower molars, presence of talonid or trigonid-like cusps and lack of lingual or buccal cingulids still set them well apart. The mammal with the most similar teeth is the Cretaceous North American Potamotelses, which serves of little indication since it too is of uncertain affinities. For now, Yingabalanara is included in its own order, Weirdodonta.

Plot and structure Theories of Forgetting is a novel made up of three intersecting narratives. The first involves the story of a middle-aged video artist, Alana, working on a short experimental video about Robert Smithson's land art Spiral Jetty. The second involves the story of Alana‚Äôs husband, Hugh, and his slow disappearance throughout Europe and across Jordan on a trip there both to remember and to forget in the aftermath of Alana‚Äôs unexpected death. His vanishing is linked to the Sleeping Beauties, a rising global religious cult that worships barbiturates. The third narrative involves the story of their daughter, Aila, an art critic and conceptual artist living in Berlin, and the marginalia she writes in her father's manuscript she discovers after his disappearance. Each of these narratives has its own unique form and texture. Alana‚Äôs takes the shape of a diary containing photographs, drawings, newspaper clippings, and meditations on Smithson‚Äôs oeuvre, with which she becomes increasingly obsessed. Hugh‚Äôs is a more conventional third-person narrative, its voice numbed, disoriented, in the wake of his wife's unexpected death. Aila's notes exist only in the margins of Hugh's text. Each page of the novel is divided in half. One narrative runs across the ‚Äútop‚Äù from ‚Äúfront‚Äù to ‚Äúback,‚Äù while the other runs ‚Äúupside down‚Äù across the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of the page from ‚Äúback‚Äù to ‚Äúfront.‚Äù In a sense, then, the novel‚Äôs physical structure suggests a spiral. Theories of Forgetting doesn't possess a front cover. Rather, it possesses two back ones. Opening it, the reader must choose what constitutes the privileged narrative, the one with which to begin, and that choice will exert pressure on the meaning she or he will make, since there are contradictory elements in the competing plots. Theories of Forgetting, then, is interested in the materiality of page as well as in such thematic questions as death and the problem of memory and history. Reception The Collagist commented that with Theories of Forgetting \\"Olsen delivers what could be called a 'destructuralized' novel that successfully resists the temptation of a conventional narrative strategy, yet for a novel that so self-consciously flashes its experimental bona fides, Theories remains eminently readable. Innovation and accessibility need not be in opposition to each other.\\" The Quarterly conversation called Olsen's novel \\"a masterful work.\\" External links *Interview with Lance Olsen about Theories of Forgetting (March 2014) References Postmodern novels Historiography Contemporary philosophical literature American magic realism novels Fantasy novels Metafictional novels ","title":"Theories of Forgetting"},{"id":"51174081","text":"Ulrich Aumayer, O.F.M. or Ulrich Aumair (died 1468) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Auxiliary Bishop of Regensburg (1456‚Äì1468).

Military service Many women wanted to play an active role in the war, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. These included the Women's Transport Corps, Women's Flying Club, Women's Emergency Signalling Corps and Women's Australian National Services. In July 1940 in Brisbane alone there were six different organisations providing women with war-related training, the largest of which was the Queensland-based Women's National Emergency Legion. The federal government and military did not initially support women being trained to serve in the armed forces, however, and these organisations were not taken seriously by the general public. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. The Royal Australian Air Force established the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) in March 1941, the Army formed the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) in October 1941 and the Australian Army Medical Women's Service (AAMWS) in December 1942, and the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) came into being in July 1942. In 1944 almost 50,000 women were serving in the military and thousands more had joined the civilian Australian Women's Land Army (AWLA). Many of these women were trained to undertake skilled work in traditionally male occupations in order to free servicemen for operational service. Women were also encouraged to work in industry and volunteer for air raid precautions duties or clubs for Australian and Allied servicemen.Darian-Smith (1996), pp. 62‚Äì63.

During the latter his most notable role was when he commanded the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division during the Second Battle of El Alamein and in the Tunisian Campaign from 1942 to 1943. Generals.dk Early life and First World War Nichols was born on 5 July 1896 in the town of Markington, Harrogate, North Yorkshire.England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837‚Äì1915England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916‚Äì20071901 England CensusEngland & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858‚Äì1966, 1973‚Äì1995 His father was the Reverend Sebastian Elijah Nichols, an Anglican clergyman, and his mother was Caroline Isabel Mare. Nichols was educated at Eton College and, after volunteering for the British Army, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Lincolnshire Regiment (later the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment) in late September 1914.Smart, p. 233 Promoted to lieutenant in early August 1915, and a captain in early June 1916, he served with the 1/5th Battalion, Lincolns, serving as part of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade of the 46th (North Midland) Division, on the Western Front for most of the war, earning the nickname of \\"Crasher\\", and being awarded the Military Cross (MC) in 1918, in addition to being twice wounded. Between the wars Nichols, made an honorary lieutenant in late November 1919, like many others who had joined up initially for the war, chose to remain in the army, which he did during the interwar period. He transferred to the Indian Army reserve of officers and served with the 21st Punjabis as an acting major in the Waziristan campaign, where he was awarded a Bar to his MC for operations with the Waziristan Field Force in 1921. He transferred back to the British Army to the Border Regiment in March 1922. By now a captain, and returning to England, he attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1930 to 1931, serving alongside such students as G. F. Hopkinson, M. C. Dempsey, M. A. James, J. S. Steele, W. H. E. Gott and G. W. Symes. After graduating from Camberley in December 1931 he served, from November 1932, as a General Staff Officer (GSO) for Physical Training with Aldershot Command, and was promoted to brevet major in early January 1936. In February 1935 he then became a brigade major with the 13th Infantry Brigade, then commanded by Brigadier John Priestman and was sent to Palestine during the Arab revolt there. Relinquishing this position in February 1937, to Major Manley James, one of his fellow students at Camberley, he was promoted to permanent major in August 1937. From 1938 to 1940, he was Chief Instructor of the Senior Officers' School of the British Military Mission to the Egyptian Army, and was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant colonel. Second World War During the Second World War, Nichols served with a mixed formation known as Habforce which forced a successful conclusion to the Anglo-Iraqi War. He later commanded the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment, then serving as part of the 23rd Brigade of Major-General Ronald Scobie's 70th Infantry Division, during Operation Crusader, in November 1941. In late January 1942, shortly before the battalion departed for India, he took command of the 151st Infantry Brigade, part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, and in late June commanded the 10th Indian Infantry Division, whereby he was promoted to the acting rank of major-general. From July 1942 he succeeded Major General William Ramsden as General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, leading it in the First Battle of El Alamein, the Second Battle of El Alamein in late October and in the Tunisian Campaign at the Battle of the Mareth Line in March 1943, where it formed part of Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese's XXX Corps. However, he was relieved of his command in mid-April 1943 by General Sir Bernard Montgomery, the British Eighth Army commander, blamed for his division's relatively poor performance during the battle, although the blame was more a faulty plan than it was Nichols's fault. He was succeeded as GOC 50th Division by one of Montgomery's protegees, Major General Sidney Kirkman, who, like Horrocks, had been at the Staff College, Camberley alongside Nichols in the year below during Nichols's second year. For his services in the Middle East Nichols was twice mentioned in despatches. He later commanded the 182nd Infantry Brigade, part of Major-General Charles Wainwright's 61st Infantry Division, in the United Kingdom from November 1943, being made a temporary brigadier the following month, and a lieutenant colonel in mid-January 1944 He also commanded the Special Allied Airborne Reconnaissance Force from March to July 1945. In August 1945 he took command of the 114th Infantry Brigade (formerly the 211th Infantry Brigade). Postwar He retired from the army as a colonel, although he had attained the rank of acting major general during his military career and most sources state he was a brigadier. He died on 7 February 1954 at Aldershot, Hampshire, at the relatively young age of 57. Nick Smart writes that the \\"rise and fall of 'Crasher' Nichols was due, no doubt, to a variety of factors. But what his wartime trajectory demonstrates was the importance of patronage in making or breaking an officer's career. An 'old desert hand', he had shown himself 'a brave and honourable soldier'. His 'failure' at Mareth may have been due to his own shortcomings, as Montgomery, by this time enraptured by his own 'left hook' success, expressed with such emphatic authority. But the alternative possibility, that too much was demanded of him and his Division and that blame for the failure of the frontal attack lay higher up the chain of command, has scarcely had an airing. Later in the war, Leese, Nichols' corps commander at Mareth, had to, as he put it, 'carry the can for Dickie (Mountbatten)'. The possibility remains that Leese withdrew his patronage from Nichols because, embarrassed by his own failure, he needed someone to carry his can\\".Smart, p. 233‚àí234 References Bibliography External links *Generals of World War II - 1896 births 1954 deaths Border Regiment officers British Army personnel of World War I British Army personnel of World War II British military personnel of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Officers of the Legion of Merit People educated at Eton College People from Harrogate Recipients of the Military Cross Recipients of the War Cross (Greece) Royal Lincolnshire Regiment officers ","title":"John Nichols (British Army officer)"},{"id":"51174226","text":"Fameless is an American prank show hosted by David Spade that aired on TruTV for two seasons from 2015 to 2017.

It is approximately long and flows through New Milford Township and Harford Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. It flows through a lake known as Tingley Lake in its upper reaches. The surficial geology in the vicinity of Leslie Creek mainly includes Wisconsinan Till and alluvium, with some alluvial fan, wetlands, and lakes. Course Leslie Creek begins near Wolf Hill in New Milford Township. It flows south for several tenths of a mile, passing through an unnamed pond, entering Harford Township, and passing through another unnamed pond. The creek then turns east before turning south again for a short distance, entering Tingley Lake, where it receives an unnamed tributary from the right. The creek then flows southeast for several tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the right and one from the left before entering a wetland. Here, it turns south for several tenths of a mile before turning south-southeast. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek receives an unnamed tributary from the right and crosses Pennsylvania Route 547. It continues flowing south-southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning south, receiving another unnamed tributary from the right, and turning southeast. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile before reaching the end of its valley and turning east. A short distance further downstream, the creek reaches its confluence with Nine Partners Creek. Leslie Creek is approximately long. Leslie Creek joins Nine Partners Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology, geography, and geology The elevation near the mouth of Leslie Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is above sea level. The surficial geology at the mouth of Leslie Creek mainly consists of alluvial fan, with some alluvium. Further upstream, the surficial geology along the creek consists mainly of alluvium, but the sides of the valley have a till known as Wisconsinan Till. In the upper reaches, the surficial geology along the creek mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, but there is some alluvium, wetlands, and lakes. Leslie Creek has been described as a \\"small creek\\". It passes through a lake known as Tingley Lake in its upper reaches. Leslie Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Watershed and biology The watershed of Leslie Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Harford. Its mouth is located within of East Lenox. The designated use for Leslie Creek is aquatic life. History Leslie Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179216. According to several local residents in the 1960s, an official 1932 map of the area showed Leslie Creek flowing too far to the east. The creek was described as flowing through the community of Harford in several old deeds and documents. By 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had made plans to reconstruct a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 547/Fair Hill Road over Leslie Creek. The bridge, whose purpose was to allow access to the village of Harford, was deemed structurally deficient and functionally obsolete, but contributed to the Harford Historic District.

The northeastern end is adjacent to the on ramp from Two Wells Road to the Gawler Bypass Road. The southwestern end is adjacent to Port Wakefield Road. It is named after Stuart O'Grady. Description The bikeway crosses roads at-level near each of the five expressway exits. At two of these junctions, the bikeway crosses two roads ‚Äî At Two Wells Road it also crosses Wingate Road which provides a local road crossing of the Gawler River and at Womma Road, the bikeway also crosses the north-south Heaslip Road. Several of the minor roads that were cut to create the Max Fatchen Expressway have a pedestrian and bike gate in the fence to provide access to the shared path from roads that do not have direct access to the expressway. The expressway, and hence bikeway, is located west of most of the suburbs it passes near. As a consequence, it can be quite windy due to being exposed on the Adelaide Plains with little tree cover in some areas. Adjacent land includes some almond and olive orchards, but also market gardens, vineyards, cereal crops and vacant land. It crosses the former Smithfield Magazine munitions store south of Curtis Road, and some of the historic buildings remain. There is no water or food available anywhere along the route, but there are two picnic shelters. One is in a planted native garden on the north side of the Gawler River. The other is north of Womma Road, not far from a small cemetery and ruins of the Zoar Bible Christian chapel which had served the Penfield community. There are interpretive signs at these landmarks and all of the bridges to cross the Expressway, which are named after famous military battles that involved Australian forces. Proposed extension The Stuart O'Grady Bikeway is proposed to be extended by next to the Northern Connector to reach the junction of Salisbury Highway and North-South Motorway by the end of 2019. A new path parallel to the Port River Expressway will also be built, completing a shared cycling and walking track between Gawler and Port Adelaide by the end of 2019.

Reviews Gladys Hain in The Argus admired the choices made by the author. \\"Had Martin Boyd been so minded, he might have made of this story a bitter satire, attacking capitalistic society as one which gives to money the power to mould character irretrievably. He has chosen rather to make of his book a wandering, almost meandering sketch of a woman who never recovered from the taste of splendour she got when she lived with her devoted and slightly idiotic parent, an Irish peer, in his castle on the shores of a beautiful lake...Also, had Mr Boyd chosen to dig a little deeper and lay bare the emotions behind the clash between Bridget and her children, he would have written a very powerful novel. Instead, he has chosen, and perhaps wisely, to make his book a comedy of manners, and, as such, it is a highly enjoyable story.\\"Gladys Hainn, \\"Australian writes a comedy of manners\\", The Argus, 5 November 1949, p16  See also  * 1949 in Australian literature References 1949 Australian novels Novels by Martin Boyd ","title":"Such Pleasure"},{"id":"51174443","text":"This is a list of films produced in Albania during the 1990s.Arkivi Qendror Shtet√´ror i FilmitQendra Komb√´tare e Kinematografis√´ Films * Bardh√´ e zi (1990) * Jeta n√´ duart e tjetrit (1990) * Kronik√´ e nj√´ nate vere (1990) * Ngjyrat e mosh√´s (1990) * Nj√´ djal√´ dhe nj√´ vajz√´ (1990) * Shpella e pirat√´ve (1990) * Vdekja e burrit (1990) * Vetmi (1990) * Kush e solli Doruntin√´n?

At a function to celebrate the 24th anniversary of German reunification attended by the Hong Kong Chief Secretary, Carrie Lam, Germany's Consul-General to Hong Kong, Nikolaus Graf Lambsdorff, responded to the incident stressing, \\" ... especially in the light of our own recent German history, I believe that Hong Kong can be proud of its youth.

As of 2015, Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz is the largest bank in Bolivia by assets. It is a full-service corporation that provides a wide range of financial products and services to an individual and corporate client base through a national network of operating 93 branches, more than 350 ATMs, call centers, and online and mobile banking platforms. Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz was created in 2006 by the merger of Banco Mercantil and Banco Santa Cruz, which began operations in 1905 and 1966 respectively. History Banco Mercantil Historical building of Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz in La Paz, Bolivia. The history of Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz dates back to December 11, 1905, when Sim√≥n I. Pati√±o, a Bolivian magnate who was among the world's wealthiest people at the time of his death, founded Banco Mercantil. Its headquarters were established in Oruro, which at that time it was the main mining center of Bolivia. The bank was set with an initial capital of physical gold worth ¬£1,000,000, which were transferred from London to Oruro. Under those conditions, Banco Mercantil opened its doors to the public on December 1, 1906, also inaugurating branches in La Paz, Cochabamba, Sucre, Potos√≠, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Antofagasta. In 1907, Bolivia suffered an economic downturn due to the global financial crisis that occurred that year. As a result, many mining companies, which played a significant role in the businesses of the bank were forced to close. After the crisis, Pati√±o made a significant increase of capital to the bank in order to save it from bankruptcy. By 1910, Banco Mercantil became Bolivia's largest bank, surpassing the older Banco Nacional de Bolivia. In 1926, Banco Mercantil moved its headquarters to La Paz, the country's seat of government. The bank, which was primarily created to do businesses with the mining industry, reached its peak in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1947, Pati√±o passed away and his heirs transferred their shares to the Fundaci√≥n Universitaria Pati√±o, a philanthropic organization. In 1968, all the bank's shares were subsequently sold to a group of private investors in Bolivia. Until 2006, Banco Mercantil was Bolivia's largest private bank. Banco Santa Cruz On September 24, 1966, following an authorization from the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions of Bolivia, the Bank of Santa Cruz de la Sierra S.A. was officially inaugurated in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In July 1992, its corporate name was changed to Banco Santa Cruz S.A. Within the next few years, the company quickly developed and expanded its network of branches to all major cities in Bolivia, including La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro, Sucre and Tarija. Banco Santa Cruz was renowned for its innovative operations, becoming the first financial company in Bolivia in implementing online banking, drive- through banking agencies, a comprehensive network of ATMs and the largest network of branches in the country and abroad. On July 12, 1998, 90% of the shares of Banco Santa Cruz S.A. were sold to the Spanish Banco Central Hispano. In January 1999, Banco Central Hispano merged with Banco Santander, creating a new financial institution called Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH). Until October 2001, Banco Santander Central Hispano had a 95.76% stake in the Bolivian bank. On April 18, 2006, Grupo Santander, announced the sale of all of its shares to Banco Mercantil, which acquired Banco Santa Cruz thus creating a new company under the name of Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz S.A. The merger of the two companies resulted in the creation of Bolivia's largest bank. 2006 to present Following the merger of Banco Mercantil and Banco Santa Cruz in 2006, Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz became the largest financial institution in Bolivia in terms of assets. As of 2011, the bank's loan portfolio reached $1 billion over $3 billion in total assets. Operations As of 2014, Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz offers its services through 93 branches, more than 350 ATMs, as well as online and mobile banking platforms. It serves 457.791 clients in Bolivia. Some of its offered financial services include. Consumer Banking is the largest division in the company, and provides financial services to consumers and small businesses. *Certificates of deposit/Term deposits *Mobile Banking *Credit cards *Microfinance *Mortgage loans *Saving accounts *Insurance brokerage *Advice services *Securitization External links * Official Website References Banks of Bolivia Banks established in 1905 Bolivian brands 1905 establishments in Bolivia ","title":"Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz"},{"id":"51174538","text":"Stavropoulos () is a Greek family name which ‚Äì in its Latinized form ‚Äì can also be found in the Greek diaspora.

In short, this means crowdsourcing of sensor data from mobile devices.  Background  Devices equipped with various sensors have become ubiquitous. Most smartphones can sense ambient light, noise (through the microphone), location (through the GPS), movement (through the accelerometer), and more. These sensors can collect vast quantities of data that are useful in a variety of ways. For example, GPS and accelerometer data can be used to locate potholes in cities, and microphones can be used with GPS to map noise pollution. The term \\"mobile crowdsensing\\" was coined by Raghu Ganti, Fan Ye, and Hui Lei in 2011. Mobile crowdsensing belongs to three main types: environmental (such as monitoring pollution), infrastructure (such as locating potholes), and social (such as tracking exercise data within a community). Current crowdsensing applications operate based on the assumption that all users voluntarily submit the sensing data leading to extensive user participation. It can also indicate the way mobile device users form microcrowds based on a specific crowdsensing activity.  Types  Based on the type of involvement from the users, mobile crowdsensing can be classified into two types: * Participatory crowdsensing, where the users voluntarily participate in contributing information. * Opportunistic crowdsensing, where the data is sensed, collected and shared automatically without user intervention and in some cases, even without the user's explicit knowledge. Taking advantage of the ubiquitous presence of powerful mobile computing devices (especially smartphones) in the recent years, it has become an appealing method to businesses that wish to collect data without making large-scale investments. Numerous technology companies use this technique to offer services based on the big data collected, some of the most notable examples being Facebook, Google and Uber.  Process  Mobile crowdsensing occurs in three stages: data collection, data storage and data upload. Data collection draws on sensors available through the Internet of things. There are three main strategies for collecting this data: * The user of a device collects data manually. This can include taking pictures or using smartphone applications. * The user can manually control data collection, but some data can be collected automatically, such as when a user opens an application. * Data sensing is triggered by a particular context that has been predefined (e.g., a device begins to collect data when the user is in a particular place at a particular time). The data collection phase can also involve a process called deduplication, which involves removing redundant information from a data set in order to lower costs and improve user experience. The deduplication process filters and compresses the data that has been collected before it gets uploaded. The second stage involves the storage of data in the user's device until it gets another user to share and communicate. For instance, videos monitoring an activity (e.g. traffic) may be stored on a user's device for a specific period and is then transmitted to a person or institution capable of taking action.  Challenges   Resource limitations  Mobile crowdsensing potential is limited by constraints involving energy, bandwidth and computation power. Using the GPS, for example, drains batteries, but location can also be tracked using Wi-Fi and GSM, although these are less accurate. Eliminating redundant data can also reduce energy and bandwidth costs, as can restricting data sensing when quality is unlikely to be high (e.g., when two photos are taken in the same location, the second is unlikely to provide new information).  Privacy, security, and data integrity  The data collected through mobile crowdsensing can be sensitive to individuals, revealing personal information such as home and work locations and the routes used when commuting between the two. Ensuring the privacy and security of personal information collected through mobile crowdsensing is therefore important. Mobile crowdsensing can use three main methods to protect privacy: * Anonymization, which removes identifying information from the data before it is sent to a third party. This method does not prevent inferences being made based on details that remain in the data. * Secure multiparty computation, which transforms data using cryptographic techniques. This method is not scalable and requires the generation and maintenance of multiple keys, which in return requires more energy. * Data perturbation, which adds noise to sensor data before sharing it with a community. Noise can be added to data without compromising the accuracy of the data. * Aggregation-Free Data Collection, which decentralizes the spatial- temporal sensor data recovery through message-passing. This mechanism intends to recover spatial-temporal sensor data the without aggregating participants' sensor/location data to a center node (e.g., organizer), so as to protect the privacy. Data integrity can also be a problem when using mobile crowdsensing, especially when the program is opt in; in these situations, people can either unintentionally or maliciously contribute false data. Protecting data integrity can involve filtering, quality estimation, etc. Other solutions include installing collocated infrastructure to act as a witness or by using trusted hardware that is already installed on smartphones. However, both of these methods can be expensive or energy intensive.

Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory is administered by Territory Families, since a departmental reorganisation following the Labor victory at the August 2016 Northern Territory general election. Juvenile detention is mostly operated through two facilities - the Alice Springs Juvenile Holding Centre in Alice Springs, and the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in eastern Darwin. These had previously been administered by the Department of Correctional Services. A juvenile is a child between the age of 10 and 17. The Northern Territory, as of June 2015, had a juvenile detention rate of 16.7 per 100,000 people ‚Äì the highest of Australia's states and territories. A report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in April 2016 showed that in 2014‚Äì15 of a national total of 900 juveniles in detention on an average day, 41 were in detention in the Northern Territory. However, in terms of incarceration rates, the Northern Territory overwhelmingly had the highest rate of juveniles in detention of any state or territory. It detained 15.6 in every 10,000 children of that age on an average day. Western Australia had the next-highest rate at 6.1 children detained, while Victoria had the lowest at 1.5.Youth Justice in Australia 2014-15 report, prepared by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported in The Age, 28 July 2016, Explainer: juvenile detention state by state The juvenile detention system was the subject of the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory established by Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull on 28 July 2016, following the broadcast of the Four Corners episode \\"Australia's Shame\\", which highlighted the abuse of children in the system. The final report for the Royal Commission was tabled to the Australian Parliament on 17 November 2017. History Early juvenile detention systems A system of criminal punishment for minors had existed in the Northern Territory since the territory's establishment in 1911. Historically, juvenile detention systems operated in the area of Northern Territory as early as settlement in the early 1860s, when the area was in control of the colony of New South Wales and shortly before control of the territory was handed over to South Australia. 20th century Prior to 1970, it was common for juvenile offenders to be transferred to South Australia, due to the lack of available facilities in the Territory.https://www.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/238217/youth- justice-review-report-part-4.pdf Essington House was established in Darwin in the late 1960s, and was the first and only holding and remand facility for juveniles. However, in their report in 1973, Hawkins and Misner called for the establishment of a juvenile remand centre, and noted that juveniles could be held in gaol for up to a week before being transferred to Essington House. In the 1970s, incarcerated youths were sent to adult prisons such as Fannie Bay Gaol. Fannie Bay Gaol operated between from 1883 to 1979, initially housing male and female prisoners, including juveniles. Juveniles were not permitted to associate with adult prisoners and accordingly, they were not permitted to participate in work or education programs. The Report from the Select Committee Appointed to Inquire into Prisons and Prison Legislation (the Ward Report) recommended, inter alia, that alternatives to juvenile incarceration should be investigated. The Ward Report described the treatment of juvenile offenders as a matter of grave concern: :that they should have to be sent to such prisons as those at Fannie Bay and Alice Springs because of the lack of other facilities is a public disgrace. Suitable alternatives should be provided without delay. Fannie Bay Gaol closed in 1979 and was replaced by the new Berrimah Prison. In 1984, the Northern Territory Juvenile Justice Act was passed, which defined juveniles to be persons aged 17 and under, and also officially established a Juvenile Court and a Juvenile Justice Review Committee. The Giles House, located in Alice Springs, was opened as the Northern Territory's first juvenile detention center in 1984, implemented with a focus on \\"providing detainees with life skills and education, thereby ensuring young offenders were not put in prisons; that they did not come under the influence of hardened criminals and that they did not, after being released, follow a life of crime.\\" In January 1986, based on the recommendations of the Juvenile Justice Review Committee, control of juvenile justice functions were transferred from child welfare services to a newly established Department of Correctional Services. In 1987, an amendment to the Juvenile Justice Act replaced the Juvenile Justice Review Committee with two boards of management. The Wildman River Wilderness Work Camp was also established in 1987 as a male-only, long-term remand and sentenced detention center with a community service system based on the \\"Outward Bound\\" model of providing youths with a series of increasingly challenging tasks. Wildman River was for boys only, as the facilities were not considered suitable for girls. In 1987, Malak House was approved as a juvenile detention centre in Darwin. The over-representation of Aboriginal juveniles in detention centres was noted as was low education rates and the need to re-engage Aboriginal youths with traditional elders. The Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill 1990 proposed to authorised the Juvenile Court to order restitution against the parents of a juvenile offender and to order parents to contribute towards the cost of detention of a juvenile. The scheme was not implemented. In 2001, the scheme was back on the agenda in the form of the Juvenile Justice Amendment Act 1991 and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Act 1991 amending the Juvenile Justice Act. In 1991, the Malak House, Darwin was replaced by the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, the first purpose-built juvenile detention center, with a higher level of security than Malak House and Wildman Work Camp. Don Dale had a capacity of 22 offenders. In Alice Springs, Giles House, after being closed for two years following the opening of Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, was reopened and renamed Aranda House. Aranda House operated between 1989 until early 2011. In 1993, Police reported that: :In the period 1 July 1991 to 31 December 1992, a total of 3,752 charges were made against 917 juvenile offenders. The vast majority of charges were for offences against property, being 2251 charges, representing 60% of the total laid in this period. Police statistics indicated that the majority of juvenile offenders charged were male, Aboriginal, between 14 and 16 years of age, and resided in the Darwin metropolitan area.Northern Territory, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 27 May 1996, 8606 (Mr Poole, Minister for Correctional Services) Correctional Services reported that: :The proportion of Aboriginal juveniles sentenced to detention decreased from 89.41% in 1991 to 68.75% in 1992. The percentage of Aboriginal juveniles on remand decreased from 80.11% to 67.85% over the same period. Since February 1987, there has been a 10% reduction in juvenile detention rates, and a reduction of 91% in juvenile imprisonment rates. As with police figures, the vast majority of offences (74%) committed by juveniles on Correctional Services programs were property offences. In 1997, mandatory sentencing was introduced with amendments to the Sentencing Act and Juvenile Justice Act, with persons aged 15 and 16 now being subject to a minimum detention of 28 days. There was an increase of 53% in the number of juveniles sentenced and detained by June 1998.Helen Bayes, ‚ÄòPunishment is Blind: Mandatory Sentencing of Children in Western Australia and the Northern Territory‚Äô (1999) 22 University of New South Wales Law Journal, 286, cited in Australian Human Rights Commission, Mandatory Detention Laws in Australia: An Overview of Current Laws and Proposed Reform (2001) 21st century Juvenile detention rates in Australia, by state and territory, in 2011, 2014 and 2015. (Click to enlarge) When the Labor Party won office for the first time in 2001 it repealed the mandatory sentencing laws, merged Correction Services into the Department of Justice and closed Wildman River Wilderness Work Camp. The Juvenile Justice Act was replaced by the Youth Justice Act 2006, and the Community Welfare Act was replaced by the Care and Protection of Children Act 2008. By 2015, the Northern Territory had the highest rate of detention of 10-17 year olds in Australia, eclipsing the second highest rate, that of Western Australia, by three times. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that the Northern Territory had an average rate of 16.7 per 100,000 people staying each night in youth detention centers, compared to Western Australia's 5.4 per 100,000 people. The Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre was penned to close down after an incident in August 2014 when a detainee escaped his cell, leading to prison authorities using tear gas. The facility, however, was not closed, and still operates to this day. Another proposal not followed through was put forward in June 2015 by the then- Minister for Correctional Services John Elferink to send young offenders to adult prison, without the approval of a court. Reports of child abuse, Royal Commission Throughout 2015 and 2016, allegations of staff violence and child abuse surfaced, including reports of detainees being assaulted, stripped naked, and \\"caged up like animals\\". A particular allegation of detainees being forced to eat feces for staff social media posts and forced to fight each other for junk food attracted significant media attention in Australia in September 2015. Further allegations of use of excessive force, such as the use of tear gas in the August 2014 incident at Don Dale, came to attention. In July 2016, the ABC investigative journalism and current affairs program Four Corners broadcast the episode \\"Australia's Shame\\", which contained previously confidential footage showing detainees at the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre being threatened, assaulted, stripped naked and chained to mechanical restraint chairs, sparking national and international attention. Following the broadcast of the episode and the subsequent political fallout, that included the sacking of Minister for Correctional Services John Elferink, the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull quickly appointed the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory. Since a departmental reorganisation following the Labor victory at the August 2016 Northern Territory general election, responsibility for youth detention facilities was taken over from Correctional Services, by Territory Families. Facilities there are two youth detention facilities operated by Territory Families: *The Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre, located in Alice Springs, houses up to 18 male and female detainees from Alice Springs and surrounding regions. * The larger Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, located in Berrimah, has a capacity of 38, and operates \\"a structured program of behavioural management and case management of detainees in support of offender rehabilitation that includes post release options.\\" Prior to the closure of the Wildman River Wilderness Work Camp in the early 2000s, Don Dale had a capacity of 24, with 4 reserved for females. In July 2016, 33 youths were detained at Don Dale.Teenagers and young boys to be moved from Don Dale Detention Centre to former immigration centre, 50km away Alternative pathways Seven Emu Station Seven Emu Station is a working cattle station which has been in the Shadforth family since Garawa man Willie Shadforth bought it outright for cash in 1953. Willie passed on the property to his son Frank, who now looks after guests, while Frank's son Clarry and his children manage the cattle station. Willie had maintained his traditional culture, such as in ceremonies and law, and passed his knowledge down to Frank. Frank began a self-funded program in the 2010s to help give Aboriginal boys and girls who have been in trouble a second chance in life, teaching them skills such as catching bulls, building fences and mustering. In mid-2020, the Northern Territory Government started funding for the program, committing to run youth camps over the following five years. There will be a series of intensive short-term camps and longer ones. Dale Wakefield, the NT Minister for Territory Families, said that the camps \\"not only focus on personal responsibility and consequences, but they will also give young people a way out of crime by connecting them with practical learning, vocational education training and work programs\\". Permanent accommodation will be built for residents of the long-term camps, who will be youths struggling to get out of the juvenile justice system in the Northern Territory.

The inmates sought damages from an incident where more masculine prisoners were segregated, herded into a visitation area, and taunted and threatened for days. In a 2009 paper, researchers interviewed inmates and found that the hospital facilities lacked hot water and air conditioning, and provided one bathroom for between 20 and 25 inmates. Inmates with diverse conditions, including mental illness, hepatitis, and HIV could not access treatment. The prison was failing to offer court-ordered programs, leaving some inmates in technical violation of the requirements of their sentences.

She was the first dancer hired by the CBC for their first televised variety show, The Big Revue, and made regular appearances as a dancer and actor on many television shows in the first decade of Canadian broadcasting. She turned to radio hosting in the 1960s, and then television hosting in the 1970s for CBC's The Naked Mind, The Weaker(?) Sex and V.I.P. She was one of the first women to produce variety shows on CBC, and for 18 years, she was the program coordinator for Front Page Challenge. She was nominated for several national awards for her work both in front of and behind the camera. Dancer Thomson holds a pose during a live Wayne & Shuster sketchThomson was born in Regina, Saskatchewan before her family moved to Toronto in 1945. After a childhood illness, she took up dance to speed her recovery. Although she studied several types of dance, she soon began to concentrate on ballet under Boris Volkoff, Betty Oliphant and Gweneth Lloyd; she also took summer classes in New York City. In 1951, while in New York, she successfully auditioned for the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes and the touring company of Kiss Me Kate, but decided to return to Toronto, where she married her first husband, danced for various open-air productions, and taught ballet for Gweneth Lloyd at the Canadian School of Ballet. In 1952, the new television department of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation prepared to go on air with Canada's first live televised variety show, The Big Revue. Thomson auditioned with 110 other dancers for a spot on the three-person chorus line; she was the first dancer hired. There were many challenges and mishaps in the age of live television. On one show, Thomson was struck in the head by a swinging microphone boom just before going on-camera, and although she completed her routine, she couldn't remember anything about her dance afterwards; on another show, she had to walk down a set of stairs wearing a feathered costume while trying to hold on to two pigeons that were doing their best to frantically fly away. During the first decade of Canadian television, Thomson performed regularly on Wayne & Shuster, The Barris Beat, The Denny Vaughan Show, and Hit Parade, and also appeared as an actor in various live dramas. She also met or worked with both established stars such as Duke Ellington‚Äîwho told her \\"I'm going to tickle the ivories, then I'm going to tickle you\\"‚Äîas well as then-unknowns like Norman Jewison ‚Äî at the time the studio director on The Big Revue ‚Äî singer Robert Goulet, and a young folksinger named Gordon Lightfoot, who told everyone in the CBC cafeteria that he was going to be a star. In 1958, Thomson was elected to the board of ACTRA as a dancer representative. She would continue to serve ACTRA in many capacities over the next forty years, including as vice-president in 1975. Radio and television host As her career progressed, Thomson moved from variety shows to current affairs programs. On the lifestyle show Open House (1960‚Äì62), she demonstrated exercises. She was an interviewer on Tabloid and Seven-O-One. And she was also a frequent guest panellist on Front Page Challenge. In 1963 Thomson was choreographer for the television program Juliette (starring Canadian singer Juliette), but also started hosting the CBC radio program Audio. When she sat behind the microphone for Four for Forty, she became the first woman to host a radio game show.With husband Knowlton Nash, 1984 In 1969, Thomson moved back in front of the television camera as host of The Weaker (?) Sex, and as a guest actor in the short-lived CBC detective series McQueen. In 1970, she also took on a behind-the-scenes role as program coordinator for Front Page Challenge, a position she was to fill for the next 18 years, booking the mystery guests, preparing research and doing the pre-interviews with guests. Many of the guests provided special challenges backstage: Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau playfully tried to pull Thomson on-camera with him during a live show in 1974. Sarah Churchill showed up at the studio intoxicated; when Thomson tried to take her back to her hotel to get her sobered up before the taping, Churchill began hitting Thomson with her purse. Front Page Challenge was only thirty minutes long, and because the panel had to guess the identity of each mystery guest, there wasn't much time left for an interview; some viewers complained that the very brief interviews didn't give the guests a chance to tell their stories. What was needed was a second opportunity for an in-depth interview with each guest. In 1973, this resulted in V.I.P., a nationally televised program hosted by Thomson, where she re-interviewed the special guests from Front Page Challenge at length. Her guests included Lord Thomson of Fleet, Martha Mitchell‚Äîwho insisted Thomson search her hotel room for spies, since Mitchell was convinced she was being followed  Harrison Salisbury, Clare Booth Luce, Sir Edward Heath, Ken Read, Chief Dan George, Buzz Aldrin, Clement Freud, Butterfly McQueen, Anna Russell, June Havoc and Lorne Greene. In its first season, V.I.P garnered over a million viewers each week. It would subsequently air for ten years. In 1981, Thomson was a finalist for the ACTRA award for Best Host Television for her work on V.I.P. In 1970, while sharing a taxi with actor Bruno Gerussi, Thomson and Gerussi conceived of the idea for an awards show that would honour Canadian radio and television. Two years later, she and author Pierre Berton co-founded the ACTRA Awards and for the next 8 years, Thomson would continue to co-ordinate the Awards with ACTRA and CBC Television. In 1974, as a member of the Board of the Canadian Mental Health Association, she created and hosted the panel show The Naked Mind to examine issues around mental health. In addition to discussion by experts, the four-part program illustrated those issues with excerpts from famous plays performed by well-known Canadian actors. Thomson was one of the first women to produce variety specials for CBC Television, including Juliette‚Äôs Favourite Things, and in 1988, she was a Best Variety Program finalist for a Gemini award as producer of Gordon Pinsent Sings Those Hollywood Songs. In 1989, she retired from broadcasting to accept an appointment to the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. Personal life Thomson had two children from her first marriage. Her second marriage, to CBC journalist Knowlton Nash in 1982, would continue until Nash's death in 2014.

It is capable of shooting 4K UHD, and 12-16 MP within a maximum of 64 GB microSD storage. Unlike most camcorders, it incorporates a modular design, as it attaches camera gimbals to its base, which it uses to incorporate different file formats, such as lossless compression and RAW format with the Zenmuse () X5R gimbal. It is backwards compatible with the Inspire 1 UAV Zenmuse gimbal.  Overview  The DJI Osmo is a camcorder, as it is only packaged with its handle, camera gimbal, and case. The interface of the camera is controlled through a smartphone app called \\"DJI Go\\", which is used in certain Phantom drones.  Specifications   Hardware   Camera  The DJI Osmo uses a 12.4 megapixel Sony Exmor R CMOS 1/2.3\\" sensor with a 94 degree FOV and a f/2.8. It has an ISO range of 100-3200 for video and 100-1600 for still photos.

(2.43 x 1.9 x 6.4in) Controls are a record button, a joystick, and a trigger in the front. A power slider for turning on and off the camera is located in the right side of the handle. On the left side, a mount can be attached onto the camera. = Microphone = The camera is equipped with an internal microphone for audio recording, and a 3.5mm jack placed near the trigger allows external microphones to be plugged in. = Camera gimbals = The DJI Osmo is compatible with four Zenmuse gimbal-cameras: the X3, X3 Zoom, X5, and X5R. The X3, which is packaged, can shoot up to 4K video and take 12MP stills. The X3 Zoom keeps the same X3 sensor but adds 3.5x optical zoom and 2x digital lossless zoom. The X5, can shoot 4K at 30fps, and can take 16MP stills. The X5R, which is an upgraded version of the X5 gimbal, adds lossless compression and RAW format and is intended for professional use. However, the X5 and X5R require a separate adapter sold independently. The gimbals, unless locked, are stabilized with three individual motors, keeping footage steady and stabilized without editing after. When not in use, the motors lock automatically, and can be unlocked manually during set-up and initialization.  Software  The DJI Osmo has no internal display, as a smartphone running either Android or iOS needs to have the companion app, \\"DJI Go\\". However, it can also operate independently, without external connection.

The establishment of the commission followed revelations broadcast on 25 July 2016 by the ABC TV Four Corners program which showed abuse of juveniles held in the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in Darwin. Letters Patent for the Royal Commission were issued on 28 July 2016 and reissued on 1 August appointing joint Commissioners The Honourable Margaret White and Mick Gooda. The final report for the Royal Commission was tabled to the Australian Parliament on 17 November 2017. Background Mick Gooda, one of the two co-commissioners alongside Margaret White. On 25 July 2016, the ABC Four Corners investigative program aired an episode titled \\"Australia's Shame\\". The program featured youth held in the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in Darwin. The following morning, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that there would be a Royal Commission into the Northern Territory juvenile detention system. Turnbull stated on ABC Radio that the Royal Commission would be set up \\"as soon as possible\\" and the relevant parties would make moves \\"very quickly\\". He further stated that \\"Like all Australians, we are shocked by the report, by that evidence on Four Corners last night. We have moved swiftly to get to the bottom of it. We need to get all the facts out as quickly as we can. We need to expose the cultural problems, the administrative problems that allowed this type of mistreatment to occur.\\" When questioned about whether or not the Northern Territory government itself should be investigated, Turnbull pressed that \\"the important thing is to get to the bottom of what happened at Don Dale.\\" On 28 July 2016, Turnbull named The Honourable Brian Ross Martin , a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, as commissioner to conduct the inquiry and announced the terms of reference. Martin resigned as commissioner four days after being appointed due to community and political pressure over his appointment, saying that \\"rightly or wrongly, in this role I would not have the full confidence of sections of the Indigenous community which has a vital interest in this inquiry.\\" The Attorney-General George Brandis appointed the replacement joint Commissioners The Honourable Margaret White and Mick Gooda that same day. Brandis stated that the royal commission would examine the period since the Northern Territory Youth Justice Act came into operation in 2006 and focus on why two reports into the youth justice system ‚Äî including one relating to the Don Dale Centre ‚Äî were not sufficiently followed up. The two reports are the Review of the Northern Territory Youth Detention System Report of January 2015 and the Report of the Office of the Children's Commissioner of the Northern Territory about services at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre of August 2015. Terms of reference On 28 July 2016, Governor-General General Sir Peter Cosgrove issued Commonwealth Letters Patent appointing Martin as commissioner and the commission's terms of reference. The commissioner was directed to examine \\"...failings in the child protection and youth detention systems of the Government of the Northern Territory; the effectiveness of any oversight mechanisms and safeguards to ensure the treatment of detainees was appropriate; cultural and management issues that may exist within the Northern Territory youth detention system; whether the treatment of detainees breached laws or the detainees‚Äô human rights; and whether more should have been done by the Government of the Northern Territory to take appropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of inappropriate treatment.\\" Despite the Northern Territory having its own government, the Territory is officially administered under the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Commonwealth Letters Patent covered its jurisdiction. The executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory said that Turnbull undermined the royal commission by permitting Chief Minister Adam Giles, who had ultimate responsibility for the events at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre, to have a say in drawing up the terms of reference. Peak Aboriginal organisations, including the Northern and Central Land Councils, AMSANT, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and legal groups, were also critical of Martin's appointment. The federal Opposition said they were not consulted in the drawing up of the terms of reference, and called for the appointment of two Indigenous co-commissioners. As a result of the resignation of Martin on 1 August 2016, Governor-General General Sir Peter Cosgrove issued Commonwealth Letters Patent appointing White and Gooda as joint Commissioners and the Commission's terms of reference. The Commissioners have been directed to examine \\"...failings in the child protection and youth detention systems of the Government of the Northern Territory; the effectiveness of any oversight mechanisms and safeguards to ensure the treatment of detainees was appropriate; cultural and management issues that may exist within the Northern Territory youth detention system; whether the treatment of detainees breached laws or the detainees‚Äô human rights; and whether more should have been done by the Government of the Northern Territory to take appropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of inappropriate treatment. Procedures and methods Powers The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the . Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants.

It stars Vishnu Unnikrishnan, Prayaga Martin and Lijomol Jose. The film was released worldwide on 18 November 2016. Plot The film tells the story of Krishnan Nair Aka Kichu, who got a chance as a child artist and makes up his ambition to be a super star in the industry, though in his adulthood he becomes a typecast with small and similar roles he performed in his childhood. Ann Mariya (Prayaga Martin) is a newcomer to Kattappana and becomes friends with Kichu quickly, believing him to be connected with the film industry on seeing a photograph of him standing next to Priyadarshan at a local studio. Kichu mistook her boundless closeness to be love and when he sees her with her college senior Amit and confronts her, he feels shattered. The same day he has a film shoot where the director James Antony (Kalabhavan Shajon) takes a chance with him believing him to be apt for portraying the central character of his new venture. But the producer, being a newbie is not ready to risk it all and so Kichu had to forfeit the part. Returning home he faces yet another problem where two girls whom he sent to a nearby film location were mistreated, one being his neighbor's daughter, Kani. The neighbor presumes that Kichu sent them with intentions for his personal gain. His father beats and reproaches him to get lost. Kichu, out of despair decides to commit suicide. A car drives towards him, drifting and tumbling over near the edge of the cliff, the suicide point. The person appears to be an owner of a startup from their town. Kichu rescues him and reckons suicide is not an answer to problems. Another person who comes to the suicide point reads Kichu's suicide note describing his story and has a change of heart and meets Kichu. Now Kichu has acknowledged Kani's love for him, he remains friends with Ann and has overcome his inferiority complexes. Towards the credits, Kichu is called again to don the role of a petty thief in a movie. At the location however, it turns out that the role is being done by another person and Kichu is actually the hero of the film.

An agit-train (Russian: –∞–≥–∏—Ç–ø–æ–µ–∑–¥) was a locomotive engine with special auxiliary cars outfitted for propaganda purposes by the Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia during the time of the Russian Civil War, War Communism, and the New Economic Policy. Brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theater, agit-trains traveled the rails of Russia, Siberia, and the Ukraine in an attempt to inculcate the values and program of the new revolutionary government to a scattered and isolated peasantry. Launched in August 1918, agit-trains ‚Äî and their close counterparts, the urban agit-streetcar (Russian: –∞–≥–∏—Ç—Ç—Ä–∞–º–≤–∞–π) and the aquatic agit-boat (Russian: –∞–≥–∏—Ç–ø–∞—Äa—Ö–æ–¥) ‚Äî continued in limited use throughout the 1920s. The agit-train concept was revived during the years of World War II as a mechanism for the direct spread of information during a time when ordinary means of communication and government control structures between the center and the periphery had faltered. History Background During the Russian Civil War of 1918 to 1922, military operations across the vast Russian frontier tended to follow the thin network of rail lines interspersed throughout the country.Peter Kenez, The Birth of the Propaganda State: Soviet Methods of Mass Mobilization, 1917‚Äì1929. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1985; pg. 58. The front line between the Red Army of the revolutionary Bolshevik government and those of the so-called White movement of counterrevolutionary forces moved back and forth, with towns and districts moving from the control of one group to the other. The penetration of new Bolshevik government institutions and functionaries outside of major metropolitan areas was extremely weak. From the start of the civil war, trains had previously been used to dispatch agitational speakers and printed propaganda materials to the front to shore up support for the revolutionary regime among the volunteers and conscripts of the Red Army and Red Army chief Leon Trotsky had gone so far as to set up his permanent headquarters aboard a railroad car to enable he and the general staff to move easily from one military hotspot to another.Kenez, The Birth of the Propaganda State, pp. 58-59. Establishment Crowds would be gathered around agit-trains and modern technology such as phonographs and moving pictures demonstrated to a poor rural audience to emphasize the modernizing agenda of the Soviet regime. (1921 newsreel footage). In the summer of 1918 the Military Section of the Executive Committee of the All- Russian Congress of Soviets determined to expand the role of trains beyond that of the occasional distribution of leaflets, establishing a permanent \\"agit-train\\" (agitpoyezd) for the dedicated purpose of agitation and propaganda (agitprop), the V.I. Lenin.Kenez, The Birth of the Propaganda State, pg. 59. The train was first used on the Volga front on August 13, 1918.Jonathan Smele, The \\"Russian\\" Civil Wars, 1916‚Äì1926: Ten Years that Shook the World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015; pg. 248. The regime also made use of the brightly bedecked \\"agit-streetcar\\" (agittramvai) as a crowd- gathering device for outdoor dramatic performances in urban settings from 1918.Szymon Boyko, \\"Agit-Prop Art: The Streets Were Their Theatre,\\" in Stepahanie Barron and Maurice Tuchman (eds.), The Avant Garde in Russia, 1910‚Äì1930: New Perspectives. Cambridge, MA: Los Angeles County Museum of Art/MIT Press, 1980; pg. 76. Development The initial effort of the V.I. Lenin was deemed by the Bolshevik government to be so successful that five additional agit-trains were immediately ordered to be created.V. Karpinskii (ed.), Agitparpoezda VTsIK: Ikh istoriia, apparat, metody i formy raboty (Agit-trains of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee: Their history, staff, methods, and forms of work). Moscow: 1920, pg. 6. Cited in Richard Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" in Abbott Gleason, Peter Kenez, and Richard Stites (eds.), Bolshevik Culture: Experiment and Order in the Russian Revolution. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 195. This new fleet of agit-trains was put under the direction of a special commission established for that precise purpose in January 1919. In addition to their obvious use as a tool for spreading of information and ideas favorable to the revolutionary regime, the agit-trains served as a mechanism for certain Soviet leaders to gain first-hand information about the situation in the country outside of its urban centers. Those participating in the activities of the agit-train October Revolution at various times included People's Commissar of Justice D. K. Kursky, People's Commissar of Health N. A. Semashko, People's Commissar of the Interior G. I. Petrovsky, and People's Commissar of Enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky. The agit-trains also attracted the direct participation of Bolshevik political leaders. The best known of the agit- trains, the October Revolution, counted among its complement Mikhail Kalinin as its political commissar, who spent the bulk of the civil war years riding the rails ‚Äî with the train making a dozen trips in 1919 alone, each averaging about three weeks.Kenez, The Birth of the Propaganda State, pg. 61. Throughout the year the train followed the moving military front in an effort to bolster morale of the Red Army soldiers engaged in hostilities and to build support for the revolution in the towns and populated enclaves located just back of the skirmish lines. Kalinin would emphasize his own peasant background when speaking to rural audiences, calling village meetings and inquiring about requisition payments and land redistribution ‚Äî sensitive matters of great concern to the poor farming‚Äì population. The negative effects of Soviet policy were explained as military necessities and passionate appeals were made to the peasantry to voluntarily participate in the grain requisition process to make food available to the starving and depopulating cities. Official Soviet statistics ‚Äî likely inflated to some extent ‚Äî indicated that over the course of 1919 and 1920 agit-trains and agit-boats and activists riding bicycles visited 4,000 offices and factories, conducting 1,891 meetings and providing more than 1,000 lectures, and distributed about 1.5 million leaflets and newspapers. A total audience of more than 2 million was claimed for the cinematic presentations of the trains and boats during these years. Structure and scope A key part of agit-trains were their special cars for presentation of motion pictures to tightly packed audiences ‚Äî frequently the first exposure of rural Russians to the medium. (1921 newsreel footage). Agit-trains were frequently 16 to 18 cars in length.Adelheid Heftberger, \\"Soviet Agit-Trains from the Vertov Collection of the Austrian Film Museum,\\" www.incite-online.net/ They were brightly colored, bearing flags with the cars brightly painted with slogans and political art.Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" pg. 195. Leading Bolshevik artists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893‚Äì1930), El Lissitsky (1890‚Äì1941), and Kazimir Malevich (1878‚Äì1935) were commissioned to paint car exteriors and their work was bold and memorable, albeit sometimes criticized as too abstract for a poorly educated and largely uncultured rural audience. Each car featured a selection of political pamphlets, posters, and newspapers for distribution, and a small library. Trains also included a mobile darkroom for the development of photographs. A key element of the trains was a special film exhibition car, in which politically oriented movies could be shown. This represented for many peasants their first exposure to the medium of film and the experience could be compelling and effective, reaching a large audience with the simple message to support the new revolutionary government. During its first of operation the agit-train October Revolution conducted 430 free film showings, reaching an audience estimated in the hundreds of thousands.L.V. Maksakova, Agitpoezd \\"Oktiabr'skaia Revoliutsiia\\" (1919-20 gg.) [The \\"October Revolution\\" Agit- Train (1919-20)]. Moscow: 1956; pg. 11. Cited in Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" pg. 196. The source claims a total audience of more than 620,000, which averages out to about 1,425 per showing ‚Äî a highly dubious count. Peter Kenez notes that \\"very likely the figures were inflated, for it was impossible to check.\\" (Birth of the Propaganda State, pg. 62). The agit-boat Red Star Inspired by the success of its agit-train program, in 1919 the same principle was applied to an aquatic vehicle, the steamer Krasnaia zvesda (Red Star).Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" pg. 196. This vessel spent several months in 1919 and the summer of 1920 sailing up and down the Volga River, frequently docking and allowing the boarding of visitors. The Red Star presented more than 400 film shows during its two-year tenure, reaching more than half a million viewers.G.M. Gak, Samoe vazhnoe iz vsekh isskustv: Lenin o kino (The Most Important of All Arts: Lenin on Film). Moscow: 1973; pg. 52. Cited in Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" pg. 196. As with the agit- trains, the Red Star included among its most active participants leaders from the highest levels of the Russian Communist Party, including V. M. Molotov as its political commisar and Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, a top official in the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment. Krupskaya later indicated that Lenin was \\"raring to go himself but he could not leave his work even for a moment.\\"N.K. Krupskaia, Vospominaniia o Lenine (Reminiscences of Lenin). Moscow: Gospolitizdat, 1957; pg. 424. Quoted in Taylor, \\"The Birth of Soviet Cinema,\\" pg. 196. Termination and legacy During the years of World War II, the Soviet government revived the use of agit-trains to bolster support for the government among the soldiery in the face of the fascist offensive.Kenez, The Birth of the Propaganda State, pg. 62.

It is a shrub with one main stem, often compact but sometimes openly branched and with pink to pale purple flowers in summer and autumn. Description Verticordia sieberi is a shrub with a single main branch and which usually grows to a height of less than . It is sometimes a compact, small shrub but may also be openly branched with the flowers held high above most of the foliage. The leaves are linear to elliptic, long and semi-circular in cross-section. The flowers are scented and arranged in round or corymb-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on an erect stalk long. The floral cup is about long, smooth and hairy. The sepals are spreading, long, white to deep pink with 5 to 7 feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the petals, erect, about long, with short hairs around its edge. The style is long, curved and hairy near the tip. Flowering time is usually from November to April but can occur at other times, depending on weather conditions. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia sieberi was first formally described by Johannes Conrad Schauer in 1841 from an unpublished description by Karl Diesing. Schauer's description was published in Monographia Myrtacearum Xerocarpicarum. The specific epithet (sieberi) honours the Austrian botanist Franz Sieber. In his review of the genus in 1991, Alex George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. crebra, V. helichrysantha, V. plumosa, V. stenopetala, V. harveyi, V. pityrhops, and V. fimbrilepis.George, A.S. (1991) New taxa, combinations and typifications in Verticordia (Myrtaceae: Chamelaucieae). Nuytsia 7(3): 254 George described four varieties: * Verticordia sieberi Schauer var. sieberi which has sepals longer than and petals with smooth or slightly toothed edges; * Verticordia sieberi var. curta A.S.George which has sepals shorter than ; * Verticordia sieberi var. lomata A.S.George which is similar to var. sieberi but has petals with feathery or hairy edges and leaves less than wide; * Verticordia sieberi var. pachyphylla A.S.George which is similar to var. lomata but has leaves wide. Distribution and habitat This verticordia usually grows in sand, often in areas that are wet in winter, in heath and shrubland. It occurs along the south coast of Western Australia and inland near Frank Hann National Park and between Hyden and Lake King in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Coolgardie, and Mallee biogeographic region. Conservation Verticordia sieberi var pachyphylla is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. The other varieties are classified as \\"Not Threatened\\". Use in horticulture All the varieties of V. sieberi have proven difficult to propagate and establish in gardens and success in growing the species is rare.

Kajberuni princely family contributed arms and warriors in the Battle of Avarayr against the Persians in 451 AD under the leadership of Nerseh Kajberuni - who was killed during the battle along with seven other members of the family. 7th century Kajberunik canton was ultimately conquered by the Caliphate (in the 9th Century the province was integrated into the Kaysik's empire), following an entry into the Kingdom of Vaspurakan. The canton eventually fell under the Byzantine Empire‚Äôs rule in the year 1021 AD. 9th century Kajberunik was overrun by the Seljuk Turks. Later in the succession, the province was conquered by the Shah Armenns, the Eyubyannere, and the Mongols. 16th - 17th centuries Kajberuniq was affected by the Turkish-Persian war. In the beginning of the 17th Century, the Persian Shah Abbas Ist relocated thousands of Armenians from Kajberuniq into Persia. Under the conventions of Amasia (1555 AD) and Kasre- Shirin (1639 AD) the control over Kajberuniq province was transferred over to the Ottoman Empire, which became known as the Arjesh province of Van. 19th century Lake Van‚Äôs water level increased in the year 1841 AD, which resulted in the destruction of the city of Arjesh. The village-town of Akants became the administrative center for the region following the destruction of Arjesh. About twenty-six thousand Armenians suffered heavy losses in the province during the Hamidian massacres of 1896 AD. 20th century On the eve of the First World War, around Ten to Fifteen thousand Armenians lived in the canton of Kajberuniq - mainly engaged in grain, horticulture, crafts and fishing industries. Significant portion of the population residing in the Kajberuniq province were massacred during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. Genocide survivors escaped the canton and found refuge in Eastern Armenia. Shurishkan Gospel In 1498, Turvanda prince of Vaspurakan requested T. Barsegh priest of Aspisnak village of Kajberuniq canton, to make a copy of the gospel ‚Äì which later became known as Shurishan. It was difficult to imagine at the time that this manuscript will be highly admired and cherished by the Armenians of the region. Persian king Shah Abbas forcefully relocated thousands of Armenians from the Lake Van area into Persia in 17th century - the book was carefully carried to Peria, which was the most Armenian populated province of Persia at the time. Nerses Kajberuni 508x508px Nerses Kajberuni was a priest from Payazit (Old Bayazet). He escaped Ottoman Empire during the Genocide and started his family in Yerevan, Armenia. Nerses Kajberuni was executed by the Communist Party members in 1937 because of his religious affiliation.

It is also named Seoul Bike in English. Ddareungi was first introduced in Seoul in October 2015 in select areas of the right bank of the Han River. After a few months, the number of stations reached 150 and 1500 bikes were made available.http://english.seoul.go.kr/expanded-operation-seoul- bike-ddareungi/ In 2016, the number of stations has increased steadily to cover new districts. As of July 2016, there were about 300 stations and 3000 bikes available, and Seoul mayor Park Won-soon has confirmed his intention to increase the number of bikes available to 20,000.  History  The public bicycle rental service in Seoul was started in April 2000. At that time, rental facilities were established in the center of two subway stations in Chang-dong and Yeouido. In 2004, Songpa District was designated as a special bicycle district, and the bicycle-free rental service was operated mainly in the park. In 2008, a full-fledged unmanned service was launched at subway stations and the city. In November 2007, Seoul announced its bicycle policy, introducing unmanned public bicycles such as Velib in Paris. The plan was to build 5102 bicycle stations at an interval of 300m within the bike-dedicated road network area and to have 82,400 bicycles. In October 2008, Seoul again announced the bicycle master plan and confirmed again that it intends to review the introduction of public rental bicycles by 2012. However, both of the presentations focused on the expansion of bicycle roads, and there was no progress in public bicycle rental service throughout the city. At the end of the year, the Seoul Facilities Corporation launched an unmanned rental service for the Cheonggyecheon. In September 17, 2009, Mayor Oh Se-hoon, who traveled to Montreal, officially announced that he would introduce ‚Äòa bicycle taxi (named at the time)‚Äô, a public bicycle system that can be used anywhere in Seoul, similar to Montreal's BIXI. He said, \\"It will be difficult to introduce it immediately, but it can be fully introduced after piloting in 2011 for the city's bicycle road construction plan.\\" References External links * 2015 introductions Community bicycle programs Transport in Seoul ","title":"Ddareungi"},{"id":"51175167","text":"Henri Auguste Arnaud (16 April 1891 ‚Äì 14 February 1956) was a French middle- distance runner who was part of the French team at the 1912 Summer Olympics.https://www.olympic.org/henri-auguste-arnaud He reached the finals of the men's 1500 metres race, but did not win a medal.

Calendar had been created by Beta 2 of Windows Vista. Windows Vista This version supports sharing, subscribing, and publishing of calendars on WebDAV-enabled web servers and network shares. It has always supported .ics files, and the subscription feature enables syncing with Google Calendar. Its interface matches Windows Vista Mail's, but the two apps are not connected in this operating system. The default calendar can be renamed. Windows 8 A new version of Calendar with a text-heavy was added to Windows 8 as one of many apps written to run full-screen or snapped as part of Microsoft's Metro design language philosophy. It is one of three apps on Windows that originate from Microsoft Outlook, the other two being Mail and People apps. Structurally, the three apps are one and are installed and uninstalled as such. But each has its own user interface. Calendar in Windows 8 originally supported Outlook.com, Exchange, Google Calendar, and Facebook calendars. Because of API changes, Facebook and Google calendars can no longer be directly synced on Windows 8. Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features are hidden in the charms or a menu at the bottom of the screen that is triggered by right clicking. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors. When a user with a Microsoft account adds a calendar account on one computer with Windows 8 Calendar, the account will be automatically added to all other Windows 8 computers the user is logged into. .ics files are not supported in this version. Windows 10 Mail has preset server configurations for Outlook.com, Exchange, Google Calendar, and iCloud Calendar. Users can set it to use the system theme or choose a custom accent color, background image, and light/dark preference. Windows 10 Calendar has multi-window support for viewing and editing events. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors, and events can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. The default interface is Month View, but users can also use Day, Week, and Year views and print these views. The Windows 10 app also uses a flyout settings panel and a mini Ribbon interface in the viewing pane. The day of the year and calendar events show on the live tile. Like the Vista version, the important controls are readily visible and use icons to match the system's. Accounts can be grouped and relabeled, but folders cannot be edited from within the app. .ics support was added to this version in time for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.

The novel follows this doomed affair to its tragic end. Reviews A reviewer in The Age found some difficulty with the book, noting that \\"while the book is undoubtedly clever, it runs to the inordinate length of 562 pages, and is more like a scientific dissection of the love theme than the romance that the ordinary reader likes. Nor is the book quite healthy in tone. Stalwart manhood and woman hood are absent from its pages, which are occupied mostly in a study of the almost neurotic psychology, in which many authors seem to delighted. Mr. Richardson has the ability to write healthier and brisker books, if not cleverer ones, than Maurice Guest.\\"\\"New Fiction\\", The Age, 10 October 1908, p6 In a short review in The Sydney Morning Herald the reviewer noted. It is very long for a modern novel, but it shows a finished style and considerable powers of analysis. The picture of life in Leipzig is very minute, and though the detail is rather overwhelming, it all fits in its place.

In 2018, Adenegan set a new world record in the T34 100m at the M√ºller Anniversary Games in London, with a time of 16.80 seconds. Adenegan is the only T34 athletes to have completed the 100 metres in sub 17 seconds Adenegan is also the only athlete to have defeated Hannah Cockroft in aT34 Women‚Äôs wheelchair race. (Once in 2015 aged 14yrs and twice in 2018 aged 17 yrs old).https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/44916778 She won the 2018 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award. Early years Adenegan was born in 2000 in Coventry, England and attends Bablake School. She has cerebral palsy. Athletics career Adenegan took up wheelchair racing in 2012, after being inspired by the Summer Paralympics in London. At school she found herself excluded from sports due to her cerebral palsy, but the Games made her realize that sport was open to her. That year she joined a wheelchair academy in Coventry, and after becoming classified as a T34 athlete she began competing at national meets in 2013. In September 2015 Adenegan managed a major sporting coup when at the Grand Prix final in London she became the first athlete to beat world record holder Hannah Cockroft in more than seven years. The two team-mates met again a month later when Adenegan as selected as the youngest member of the Great Britain team at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha. There she entered three events, the 100 metres, 400 metres and 800 metres, all in the T34 classification. Although just missing out on the 100m podium, after finishing fourth, Adenegan won her first major international medals of her career with bronze positions in both the 400m and 800m events. Both events were won by Cockroft. Although she qualified for the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships in Grosseto, Adenegan pulled out of the event to concentrate on her preparations for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. When the final Great Britain athletics squad was announced, Adenegan was elected for three events and was the youngest team member in the track and field squad. In 2018 aged 17, Adenegan broke the T34, women's 100 metres world record at the London Muller Anniversary Diamond League defeating Hannah Cockroft by half a second. Adenegan‚Äôs placed a time of 16:80 seconds making her the only T34 athlete to have gone under 17 seconds in the history of the sport. In August 2018, at the Para World European Athletics Championships in Berlin, Adenegan defeated Cockroft in the T34 100 metres for the second time in the season, also setting a championship record of 17:34 seconds ( Cockroft finished in 17:95 seconds).

The discovery was published in 2015 by a team of archaeologists from Universidad de Burgos, Universidad de Cantabria and University of New Mexico. The publication covers an entire August issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science. The woman's age is estimated to be between 35 and 40 years. Her bones were coated with ochre, a red iron-based pigment, hence, her name. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the woman was buried around 18,700 years ago. The team of archaeologists, led by Lawrence Straus of the University of New Mexico and Manuel Gonz√°lez Morales of the University of Cantabria, had been investigating the El Mir√≥n Cave since 1996. They initially found a number of prehistoric remains. In 2010, they explored a narrow space behind a large limestone block inside the cave, where they discovered the Red Lady. Other than the skull and some bones, her skeleton was relatively intact. This indicates that she was properly buried after death. According to the archaeologist, the ochre painting and the limestone block were markers of her grave. Further, the engraving of a letter V on the wall suggest the indication of a woman's burial. Gnaw-marks on the leg bone (tibia) shows that a carnivore (estimated to be about the size of a dog or wolf) bit the bone when the flesh had decomposed. The skull and long bones were likely removed after this incident, perhaps, for display or reburial. These activities suggest that the people might have had burial rituals.

He introduced the concept of lipid rafts, as well as coining the term trans-Golgi network and proposing its role in protein and lipid sorting, The co-founder and co-organizer of EMBO, ELSO, Simons initiated the foundation of MPI-CBG, where he acted as a director (1998‚Äì2006) and a group-leader (until 2012). He is the co-founder and co-owner of Lipotype GmbH.  Biography  Kai Simons is the son of a physics professor. His father convinced him to study medicine, though he originally wanted to study physics. While studying at the University of Helsinki, Simons spent a summer internship in the Stockholm laboratory of Bengt Samuelsson There, he studied mechanisms of vitamin B12 absorption. He worked with other students to organize a campaign to fight taeniasis, a disease common in eastern Finland where eating raw fish is popular. After completing his MD in 1964, he began a postdoctoral fellowship at Rockefeller University in New York where he worked between 1966 and 1967 on blood serum protein polymorphism. He returned to Helsinki in 1967, where he began working as a Junior Investigator for the Finnish Medical Research Council at the University of Helsinki. He became a group leader in 1972 and was a biochemistry professor in 1971‚Äì79 at the medical faculty of this university At first, he continued his work on serum proteins. Next, together with Leevi K√§√§ri√§inen and Ossi Renkonen, he started a research team - later joined by Ari Helenius, his first PhD student and later a post doctoral researcher who became Simons' brother-in-law. After a one-month stay in MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge, the group started investigating a Semliki Forest virus, introduced to Simons by K√§√§ri√§inenem. In 1975 Simons came to Heidelberg (Germany), as one of the EMBL group leaders. Together with Ari Helenius he helped to develop EMBL, headed at this time by John Kendrew. In years 1982‚Äì1998 Simons was a coordinator of the Cell Biology Program there. During this time he for the first time presented the concept of lipid rafts. In 1999 he took part in setting up ELSO (later incorporated into EMBO), which later he presided over. He was one of the initiators of establishing and building Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden (Germany), where he moved. Formally from 1998 (beginning of MPI-CBG construction) and practically from 2000 he was one of five institute's directors and also a group leader there Since 2006 he is a director emeritus. In 2012 he started-up a biotech company Lipotype GmbH, where he is a CEO. He is married to Carola Simons and a father of three: twins - Mikael (neurobiologist) and Katja (sociologist), and the youngest of three, Matias (physician).  Work  Early in his career, Kai Simons pursued research in the field of medical biochemistry. Both his master's thesis and postgraduate research focused on vitamin B12 absorption. After returning from his post-doc scholarship he continued research on vitamin B12 as well as on blood plasma proteins, but soon started investigating Semliki Forest virus, focusing on its membrane and its lipid composition and their role in the virus budding and its transport, as the model for lipid and protein secretion. During this period, Simons also investigated the application of detergents in biochemistry with a special attention to their role in biological membrane research. The virus lifecycle and how it uses components of vesicular pathways while shuttling to the cell surface, turned Simons' attention toward vesicular transport pathways and cell polarization. Applying epithelial model cells - MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney), he investigated lipid transport, protein sorting and their role in polarizing cells. In these studies, he described the role of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in protein and lipid sorting according to their destination. In his works from 1988, together with Gerit van Meer, Simons proposed the existence of lipid microdomains in cell membranes for the first time. Such microdomains differ in their composition from the surrounding membrane and have special functions. Simons coined the term 'lipid rafts' to describe these microdomains. This concept was developed over the years to be presented more fully in 1997 in Nature journal by Simons and Ikonen. This paper became one of the most frequently cited works in the field of membrane research. Other Simons' paper, on role of lipid rafts in the signal transduction is second highest cited work and Simons is fourth highest cited scientist in the field of signal transduction. Kai Simons was also recognized by ISI Web of Knowledge, as one of the most cited scientist ever. In subsequent years, Simons continued to work on the role of lipid rafts, and more generally lipids, in cell polarization and protein sorting. He was interested also in the role of lipids and protein sorting in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease. His scientific record includes more than 350 scientific articles, mostly in the field of biochemistry, molecular organization of the cell, and biochemistry and physiology of a cell membrane. Considering his work from years 1996‚Äì2007 tracked until May 2009, Simons was 12. in the list of the most frequently cited scientists in the field cell biology with 90 articles and 16,299 citations.

The film stars Akkineni Nagarjuna, Anushka Shetty, Pragya Jaiswal in the lead roles while Jagapathi Babu & Saurabh Raj Jain in the supporting roles and music composed by M. M. Keeravani. Plot Rama (Akkineni Nagarjuna) born in Ayodhya, India, leaves the house in childhood itself in search of God and meets a saint Anubhavananda Swamy (Sai Kumar) who assures him, it will definitely happen and he also plays with him, so, he teaches Rama the dice game and later advises to meditate. After 15 years, Lord Venkateswara (Saurabh Raj Jain) appears in a form of child and disturbs his meditation when Rama asks him to getaway. After that, he reaches back to the hometown where his parents (Tanikella Bharani & Sudha) fixes his alliance with his cousin Bhavani (Pragya Jaiswal). Just before the marriage, Rama gets a call from his mentor in the dream that time has arrived to play with god. So, he immediately rushes towards him when he says that the boy appeared to him is none other than the Lord Venkateswara. So, heads towards Tirumala Hills. At Tirumala, Krishnamma (Anushka Shetty) is another ardent devotee who believes herself as the wife of Lord Venkateswara and dedicated her entire life to his service. Govindarajulu (Rao Ramesh) the temple administrator performs a lot of illegal activities, misuses the temple funds and makes the workers as his slaves. Meanwhile, Rama reaches Tirumala and calls the Lord in the name of Balaji out of love and affection. But Rama is not allowed into the temple, so, Rama sits outside for 7 to 8 days without having food and sleep. Govindarajulu orders his men to remove him up and they beat him very badly when the temple elephant rescues him. Later Krishnamma treats him in her Ashram‚Äô. In her guidance, Rama learns regarding Sthala Puranam (History of the temple) and decides to begin a new horizon at Tirumala by campaigning it to the pilgrims to make them aware regarding the true nature of the Lord. He also encounters Govindaraju by protecting pilgrims & employees from his atrocities. Now Rama constructs a new Ashram‚Äô at the hilltop and starts cultivating their own flowers & fruits and growing byre (Goshala) for milk products to the temple. Here Govindarajulu provokes King Giridhara Rayalu (Sampath Raj) against Rama. But he recognizes the original facts and honesty of Rama. So, he allocates the temple authority to Rama and demotes Govindarajulu as a sweeper. In a short while, Rama makes many changes in the temple by introducing a new form of prayers (Poojas), services (Seva) such as offering Harathi with butter (Navaneetha Harathi), everyday marriage (Nitya Kalyanam) to the god, amenities for devotees and make sure that the temple flourishes with all rituals as per the Holy Scriptures. Lord Venkateswara is impressed by it and lands on earth to play dice with Rama. Henceforth, every day the Lord visits to spend some time with Rama. In the beginning, the Lord loses a ring in the bet which is given by Padmavati (Vimala Raman) as a token of love, but Rama is still under dichotomy whether the event occurred or not. Later on, he craves for another glimpse of the lord, the exact moment Balaji appears before him and plays the dice, in which the Lord loses his entire jewelry. The next day, when the temple doors are opened, the Lord's statue is found empty and they are identified at Rama‚Äôs Ashram. King Giridhara Raaya arrives to conduct interrogation when Rama says that Lord himself has given it to him. But no one believes it, so the King keeps a test to Rama to prove his innocence by locking him in a prison with full of sugar cane, and asks him to eat every bit before dawn otherwise he will be sentenced to death. Soon, Lord Balaji appears in the form of an elephant and finishes it off, and disappears. In the morning, the king is surprised to know the miracle. There onwards, Rama adored by the name of Hathiram Bhavaji and the pilgrims start visiting him, before seeing the god, Rama gets fed-up and decides to leave the Tirumala. Noticing it, Balaji follows behind and takes an oath that not to leave the hill when Rama keeps a condition to bury him alive (Sajeeva Samadhi) at the hilltop, as per the vow the Lord has to do so. Afterward, his wives Padmavati & Bhudevi (Ashmitha) blames him for the deed. Finally, the Lord replies that Hathiram Bhavaji is immortal in the day to day services offered to him at the temple.

Lost work A painting of Saint Amelia by French history painter Paul Delaroche was commissioned in 1831 by Queen Marie-Am√©lie, wife of Louis Philippe, King of the French. The work was exhibited at the Salon of 1834 in Paris. In 1837, the painting was recorded as being hung in the Royal Chapel at the Tuileries Palace in Paris, and it was copied in an engraving by Paolo Mercuri. It was also reproduced as the main panel in a stained glass window for the Queen's private chapel at the Ch√¢teau d'Eu. A preparatory drawing in chalk, graphite and watercolour is held by the British Museum. The original painting was believed to be lost. Fake or Fortune? The Fake or Fortune? team investigated a version of the painting, housed at Castle of Park in Cornhill, Aberdeenshire, to determine whether it was the Delaroche original or one of a number of copies. This unsigned work was bought in 1989, for about ¬£500, by the late Neil Wilson, an art dealer who had worked for Christie's after leaving university. The painting's provenance was very poor. In the programme, art expert Bendor Grosvenor revealed an 1866 watercolourThe Queen's bedroom by Joseph Nash by Joseph Nash depicting the painting in the Queen's bedroom at Claremont House in Surrey, where the deposed King and Queen lived after fleeing France following the Revolution of 1848. After that, the next sighting of the painting was when it was sold at Christie's in 1980 as a work by the French artist Fleury Fran√ßois Richard, with the title 'A Queen and her Retinue at Worship'. Technical analysis showed that colour anomalies in the painting were the result of pigment degradation, and that parts of the painting had also been restored. After reviewing the show's findings, Professor Stephen Bann, a leading Delaroche expert, concluded that it was the lost original. He also revealed a letter written by Delaroche, in which he registers his dismay at the state of the picture after it had been copied to create a stained glass window for Queen Marie-Am√©lie, and says that he will have to do considerable work to restore it. Following its authentication, Wilson's widow, Becky, was reported to have decided to keep the painting, but allow it to be displayed at the British Museum in London when a Delaroche exhibition takes place. Subsequently, the painting was sold via Christie's in July 2019 for ¬£33,750.Sainte Am√©lie, Reine de Hongrie ‚Äì Christie‚Äôs.

Inspired by Minecraft, it takes place in a procedurally generated world of blocks where players interact with flora and fauna, craft items, and build constructions. It was released as an early access title on Steam in August 2014, and was officially released in May 2017.  Gameplay  Creativerse puts players in possession of a futuristic gauntlet that allows the manipulation of matter. After customizing the appearance of their character, players are released into a procedurally generated world. Tooltips provide players with the knowledge of gameplay basics and give direction as they set out to explore the world. Players can create or participate in public worlds, stake claims to protect their creations, and tailor their own world via the use of in-game admin tools. Progression in Creativerse is achieved through the expanding recipe system. Players collect and refine unique resources from the world's various biomes and layers, and then utilize those resources to craft weapons, tools, items, and building materials. As players progress in crafting, they unlock more advanced recipes which include mining cells, extractors, and stations. Mining cells upgrade the player's gauntlet and enable them to gather materials from the deeper layers of the world. Extractors are used to gather precious resources like iron and coal, and stations break resources down for different uses. Some rare recipes can only be found through combat or exploration, while others only drop during seasonal events. While the game is free, premium costumes, recipe bundles, and a \\"Creativerse Pro\\" option are available to players through the in-game store. Creativerse Pro provides players with 20 extra inventory slots, the ability to create as many worlds as they like, and other perks like a flashlight and glider.  Development  Creativerse started as a pay-to-play title, but moved to a free-to-play business model upon entering Steam Early Access on August 13, 2014. It continues to receive regular free updates that improve or add to the core gameplay and features. Updated and fully customizable character models were added on May 2016. The following January, the Machines Evolved Update introduced linkable, logic-based machines that gave players the ability to add interactive experiences to their builds. Players were then given the ability to share those builds and experiences publicly in the form of Adventures, which debuted on February 22, 2017. That summer, the Blueprint Revolution Update brought Steam Workshop integration into the mix and empowered players to capture and share their creations for use in one another‚Äôs worlds.

Donk resides at the southern side of the Bocholt‚ÄìHerentals Canal and is an industrial area, especially in past. Industrial evolution The Bocholt‚ÄìHerentals Canal was constructed in 1846, the same year that \\"Turnhoutse Baan\\", a road between Turnhout and the centre of Mol, which crossed the canal was also constructed. This was the start of the industrial evolution in Donk. In 1896 a railway was built next to Turnhoutse Baan but this was already closed some decades later. It took until 1986 until the tracks were removed.[ In 1860 the exploitation of white sand started and some of such companies raised. A notable factory was Sabli√®res et Carri√®res R√©unies (SCR), founded in 1872.\\" In 1921 it took over the shares of competitor Anciennes Sabli√®res Stanislas Emsens. In 1955 the company was renamed to Sibelco. Another notable company was Grandes Sabli√®res de la Campine, founded in 1882. Although it got bankrupt some decades later the company activities led to the creation of a huge lake of 210 acres, named Miramar, which is now used as a recreation lake for water sports. Another of such lake, Zandkot, is around 20 acres. This is currently used by the nuclear plants for water cooling. There were a lot of other sand winning companies but only Sibelco remains. Besides the sand winning companies a lot of other companies arose. Notables are * Betonwerken van Moll, founded in 1911 and specialized in cement. In 1923 the company was renamed to N.V. Beton en Mollith and once again renamed in 1930 to N.V. Johns-Manville and started with the production of asbestos. * Verreries de Li√®ge et de la Campine, a glasswork founded in 1922, later on renamed to Verlica and then Verlipack. The company was shut down in 1999. The company halls were renovated and converted into a business park named Verlipark. Parts of the business park can be bought/hired. * Soci√©t√© d'Electricit√© de la Campine, an electric power plant on black coal founded in 1929. It originally had a capacity of 20 MW. In 1956 the company was taken over by EBES which is now known as Electrabel. The power plant had two chimneys of 410 feet and a cooling tower of 246 feet. Both towers could be seen from far. The power plant was shut down in 2010 as it produced too much carbon dioxide. The premises were bought by VITO who deconstructed the power plant. On 10 July 2014 the chimneys and cooling tower were blown up with dynamite. The former electric power plant with its cooling tower and chimneys. The plant was demolished and the towers and cooling tower blown up with dynamite in June 2014 Sint-Antonius Church, to be profaned at end of 2016 and to be reassigned as a community centre Some of the (renovated) working-class houses in township Donk * SCK‚Ä¢CEN, a nuclear test plant founded in 1952. Some other companies related to nuclear power are Eurochemic in Dessel and IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements). Over the years SCK‚Ä¢CEN did a lot more than only research on nuclear activities. At end of the 1980s it was decided all activities not related to nuclear purposes are no longer core business. These non-core activities were taken over by the newly founded VITO. Township Although there was industry as from 1860 it took until 1900 before Emiel Becquaert (Dessel, 1865 ‚Äì Donk, 1932), then owner of SCR, and the priest of nearby township Achterbos decided to establish an area with working- class houses. These houses still exist and are in the eastern part of Donk. In 1949 the church Sint-Antonius was built. According to rumors it was built upon a huge pit which was created by a bomb during World War II. The presence of the pit was a reduction in digging costs. Furthermore, the pit was only about 100 metres from the working-class houses and thus an ideal place. Between 1954 en 1961 a residential village, Atoomwijk (also known as Atoomdorp), was built in the west part of Donk around the nuclear sites. The design was created by architect Jacques Wybauw. This village contains apartments, dormitoria, terraced houses and some villas. These buildings are owned by the nuclear companies and they initially rented it to their temporary workers, students, foreign workers... Later on, the houses were also rented to non-employees. In 2008 the owners decided not to invest anymore in the buildings as the cost for renovation was too much and renting houses was not considered to be a core activity. It was announced some of the buildings were to be pulled down, but an action committee was set up to classify Atoomwijk as cultural heritage. Upon today no further action was taken to decommission Atoomwijk although there is now a lot of vacancy due to the announcement. It is still possible to turn in a request to rent property.Request for Residence Between 1960 and 1965 another neighbourhood was built by Molse Bouwmaatschappij in the eastern part, adjacent to the church and working-class houses. These terraced houses resemble Atoomwijk. Initial idea of Molse Bouwmaatschappij was to rent/sell these houses to permanent employees of the nuclear sites although this was not a prerequisite. Thanks to Emiel Becquaert the township got an elementary school and kindergarten. Both schools were taken over by the catholic St.-Jan Berchmanscollege which had an elementary and high school in the centre of Mol. In 2000 St.-Jan Berchmanscollege closed the schools at Donk. These were taken over by the elementary school of Mol-Sluis and thus became a state school. Due to insufficient children (due to aging inhabitants) the school was closed in June 2009. Plans for third residential area In 2012 a predesign of a new social residential area and cultural centre was proposed. The current catholic meeting place, school, library, ... will be demolished. A part of the buildings of the local boyscouts is also impacted. They will move to the former clergy house. A new cultural centre will be built behind the clergy house. Later on the plan was redesigned. Due to cultural heritage the historic school buildings and nunnery will remain and become apartments. The church will be profaned and becomes the community centre. Nature Besides the lakes, created by the sand winning industry, a large part of Achterbosheide is at the west of the village. This area contains conifer forests and heath. Almost all of it is owned by SCK‚Ä¢CEN but a big part of it is accessible for public.
