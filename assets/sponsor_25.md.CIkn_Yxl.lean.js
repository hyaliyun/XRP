Beginning in 1895, the novel was republished with the heading I Romanzi della Rosa (the Romances of the Rose), forming a narrative cycle including The Intruder (The Victim, in America), and Triumph of Death.  Plot  Trinit√† dei Monti Andrea Sperelli is a young noble dandy of Rome who lives in Palazzo Zuccari (Trinit√† dei Monti), although he is originally from Abruzzo. He loves Elena Muti, although she is married to another. Andrea fights a duel with the man, but gets injured, and taken to Francavilla al Mare, where, at Villa Schifanoja, he meets the beautiful Maria Ferres. Andrea, when cured, realizes that he loves both Maria and Elena. At the end of the story, however, he loses both women. Book I On December 31, 1886, Andrea Sperelli anxiously awaits the arrival of his ex-lover, Elena Muti in his house, Palazzo Zuccari. While waiting for her, he remembers their last farewell, which took place almost two years ago, in March 1885. Elena broke up with him in a carriage, telling him that she is to marry an Englishman. When Elena arrives, he alternates between his feelings of love for her and pain because of their separation. The narrator then explains the history Andrea's family, and his father's advice to Andrea, and his arrival to Rome as a youth. The reader then learns about Andrea and Elena's first meeting, which took place at a dinner party hosted by the Marchesa of Ateleta, Andrea's cousin. The two talk at the party and the next day meet each other again. The two begin an affair, which ends abruptly when Elena announces one night that she is leaving him. After she leaves, Andrea begins a long line of seductions, seducing seven noble women in total. At last he begins to try to seduce Ippolita Alb√≤nico. One day, while at a horse race, Andrea angers Ippolita's husband who challenges him to a duel. Even though Andrea is better at fencing, he sustains a grave injury during the duel. Book II Andrea spends time recovering at the home of his cousin Francesca, in the Villa Schifanoja. During this time he composes several poems. On September 15, 1886, Maria Ferres arrives to the villa along with her husband (who leaves shortly after) and daughter, Delfina. 10 days later, on September 25, Andrea is seduced by Maria Ferres (unbeknownst to her). Andrea finally declares his love for Maria but she demurs because her daughter is present. Maria keeps a diary during these days, in which she writes down her own feelings about the events that transpire and of her love for Andrea. Finally, on October 4, Maria tells Andrea that she loves him. Her husband returns and the two lovers are separated. Book III Once he returns to Rome, Andrea resumes his decadent lifestyle, as it was before his injury: he spends time with women of the demimonde and superficial, indifferent friends. Restless and full of bitterness, he meets Maria Ferres. His attraction to his old lover, in her new role as temptress, and his fascination with Maria for her pureness and fragility, become intertwined in his mind. He therefore tries to seduce Elena in again, in the palace where he'd first possessed her, Palazzo Barberini, but her husband appears and he immediately gives up. Soon after, Andrea spends time at Maria Ferres' house in Rome, where they talk. The next night, the two meet again at a concert at the Philharmonic, which Elena also attends. Elena becomes jealous of the couple and before leaving, asks Andrea to accompany her to her carriage where she kisses him passionately. Andrea then has a moral crisis but ultimately decides to pursue Maria, whom he loves. This does not stop him from still dreaming about Elena. Book IV Rejected by Elena's cold nature, Andrea learns through friends that Maria's husband has fallen into financial ruin caused by gambling. Maria remains strong in the face of her pain and tells Andrea that he must remain faithful to her. Andrea, however, is struggling to conceal his \\"doppio gioco,\\" literally, double game, that he has been playing, wherein he has been courting Maria and Elena without either of them knowing about the other. After seeing Elena leave her house to visit a new lover, Andrea becomes distressed. He then visits Maria and inadvertently calls out Elena's name while the two are having sex. Maria is horrified and leaves him. Andrea begins avoiding his friends and acquaintances, but one day decides to go to an auction of Maria's husband's estate. There he buys an armoire and returns home just as it is being delivered. The novel closes with him slowly following the armoire up the steps into Palazzo Zuccari. Topics The central theme is that of the decadent esthete. The novel is a central text of the Italian decadent literary movement, Decadentism. D'Annunzio was inspired by Huysmans's pioneering work, √Ä Rebours which also strongly influenced Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. The esthete Andrea is a nobleman who loves only art, and who is dedicated to the veneration of a woman, Elena. Elena's chimerical nature, however, destroys the balance of the protagonist, and reveals her to be a kind of femme fatale. The style of the novel is also of utmost importance: d'Annunzio adopts a unique brand of writing replete with courtly neologisms, frequently inflected with assonance and consonance. The work's insistence on a unique, pure language may account for its quasi- mannerist and baroque tones. 1899 novels 19th-century Italian novels Novels by Gabriele D'Annunzio ","title":"Il Piacere"},{"id":"47212932","text":"Il trionfo della morte (Triumph of Death) is a novel by Gabriele d'Annunzio. It belongs to the cycle \\"The Romances of the Rose\\".  Plot  Cathedral of Guardiagrele The story is set in the Abruzzo region, the birthplace of the author. The noble aesthete Giorgio Aurispa, besotted with his unhappily- married lover Ippolita, leaves Rome after witnessing a suicide. After a brief interlude with Ippolita in Albano, Giorgio receives a telegram from his mother, who lives in the small mountain village of Guardiagrele. Giorgio arrives in the beautiful city of stone, and is fascinated by the sculptures; however, he is equally haunted by popular superstitions and the memories of the suicide of his uncle Demetrio, whom he had loved as a father. Worse, Giorgio discovers that his actual father has squandered the family fortune, forcing his mother and siblings to live in poverty while he carries on with a prostitute. Giorgio curses his father, abandoning his family, and runs to the sea, buying a house on a hill in San Vito Chietino. Ippolita joins him, and the two pursue a summer of decadent languor marred only by Giorgio's developing paranoia towards her. Trabucco of San Vito Chietino Giorgio is additionally obsessed with death, and matters only become worse after the pair undertake a pilgrimage to the shrine of Casalbordino, where the multitude of desperate supplicants begging cures of the statue of the Madonna drives them away in horror. While Giorgio becomes more and more unmoored and desperate to leave both Abruzzo and what he perceives as Ippolita's unwholesome influence, she remains amused and fascinated by their surroundings. Finally Giorgio decides that his only recourse is to carry her over a seaside cliff, killing the both of them.  Topics: the D'Annunzio's superman  In the novel is the theme of Nietzsche's superman, glimpsed by D'Annunzio in a new way. The superman of d'Annunzio is an esthete cultured, who loves only art, and we dedicate ourselves with all his being. He is believed to dominate nature with his power, and sets out to conquer nature with a companion. This companion of love, however, is a femme fatale, which leads him to the precipice. The superman of d'Annunzio is in fact surrounded by a reality that is not his: a monstrous reality of people without quality: the common people and the middle class, always averse to d'Annunzio. The only source of power comes from the art of the superman, but when the esthete of D'Annunzio has to deal with the grim reality, it happens that the protagonist is beaten mercilessly. 1894 novels 19th-century Italian novels Novels by Gabriele D'Annunzio ","title":"Il trionfo della morte"},{"id":"47212954","title":"List of defunct airlines of Estonia"},{"id":"47212973","text":"Misha Berson is an American theatre critic with the Seattle Times.

Biography Mar√≠a Elo√≠sa Garc√≠a Etchegoyhen was born 8 July 1921 in Montevideo, Uruguay to Marcos Garc√≠a and Mar√≠a Etchegoyhen. Her mother died when Garc√≠a was very young and she was raised by her old sister, Manacha. She attended primary school at \\"the Prada\\" and completed her secondary education at Instituto La Femenina. She studied to be a teacher, graduating in 1941 from the Instituto Normal Mar√≠a Stagnero de Munar,\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 16 Her first job was in Isla Patrulla and after a few months there she transferred to Santa Clara, where she first encountered developmentally delayed students. She contacted her superiors and was given permission to study special education and returned to Montevideo.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 18 Between 1943 and 1944, she studied mental retardation and earned a specialists certificate in 1944. She began working with Dr. Emilio Mira y Lopez in 1945 at the Laboratory of Psychology researching \\"marginal cases\\" and was awarded an authorization to perform professional guidance counseling for schoolchildren. Dr. Mira also helped her apply for a scholarship to go to school in the US, which she won from the Institute of International Education. From 1945 to 1946, she worked in the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey and simultaneously at the International Institute of Education (1945-1947), receiving a certificate of mastery of Mental Hygiene and Abnormal Children's Organizational Services. Garc√≠a then participated in three work-study programs between 1946 and 1947 at the University of Michigan, at Cove School and the Institute of General Semantics. During her time in school, in 1947, she participated in the feminist Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres, as a representative for Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala. She attended the conference which explored not only women's issues, but also looked at world affairs, such as nuclear capacity, disarmament, peace, exiles, and many other issues of the post-war era. In 1948, she graduated with a master's degree in Clinical Psychology with a specialization in special education and preschool early intervention and stimulation from the University of Michigan. Garc√≠a joined the internship program of the United Nations in 1948 and returned home to Uruguay, reorganizing the Escuela Auxiliar to Escuela de Recuperaci√≥n Ps√≠quica N√∫mero 1.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 19 She directed the organization for the next eighteen years. When Garc√≠a took over the facility, it was a depository for children with disabilities and no attempts were made to educate them. One of her first objectives was to reorganize the school to help each student develop skills, learn knowledge and develop an attitude that personal empowerment could be achieved.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 24 She had to train professionals as well, teaching courses in psychology at the University of the Republic School of Nursing, Social Services Department, the Psychology and Human Relations Department and organizing courses and seminars focused on the treatment of children with mental retardation for teachers at the Normal Institute of Montevideo. One of the first things she did was establish a Club for Parents, whose purpose was to provide a support network for families. They published a newsletter and held support groups twice daily. Once during the day and another at night so that regardless of work schedules, parents could participate. The focus was on information, and sharing of experiences, because even the medical community did not know what caused a lot of the developmental delays or what the learning capacity of the children was.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", pp 27-28 She also established guidelines to allow Down Syndrome students to participate in schooling. Until Garc√≠a's proposal to the Education Council, Downs students and those with IQs under 50, were not allowed to participate in school in Uruguay.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", pp 29-30 Garc√≠a insisted that all of her staff be properly trained. In 1954 she took a scholarship from the Institute of Inter-American Affairs and studied rehabilitation programs for disabled patients, receiving a certificate of Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist from the US State Department in Washington, DC. She sent staff to Argentina study motor skills disorders and rehabilitation later sending students to study in the US and Puerto Rico on neuromuscular control. In 1956, the school accepted its first students with multiple disabilities\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 30 and in 1957 they undertook a study on occupational rehabilitation and preparedness of their students. What they determined was that most of the students were unprepared for employment. To address the shortfall, in 1958 Garc√≠a implemented an occupational rehabilitation program which aimed to give students vocational training simultaneously with academic training, had staff complete individual assessments of students' skills and employer needs, and through a \\"protected workshop\\" environment to continue monitoring trainees after placement.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", pp 38-41 By the 1960s, Garc√≠a was ready to tackle early childhood development, as new scientific research was showing the positive impact of early education. She submitted a proposal for a pre-school to be developed using the expertise of a visiting Fulbright Scholar, Dr. Howard Norris. In 1962 the program was approved and Norris began work with pediatrician, a psychologist, a visiting teacher and a nurse. They began with a diagnosis of the nature of the disability, counseling with parents as to what outcomes were likely and then created a plan of action to further the education of the child.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", pp 42-43 That same year she launched a public awareness campaign hoping to build an infrastructure of care, integration, protection and support for people with disabilities. She founded the Asociaci√≥n Nacional pro Ni√±oRetardado Mental (ANR) to promote the general welfare and development of programs and research to benefit the developmentally disabled.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", pp 53-54 By 1966, Garc√≠a expanded the program further, to include a research program working with expectant mothers. In that same year, she won the 1966 Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation Award for her contributions to mental health.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 44 Garc√≠a began working with the Organization of American States Inter-American Children's Institute (IIN) in 1966, as the head of the Special Education and Early Childhood Division. She served for the next twenty years trying to develop and improve special education programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and foster collaboration between European and US academic and medical centers with their counterparts in Latin American and the Caribbean. In 1967, Garc√≠a was named to the Consejo Nacional de Ense√±anza Primaria y Normal and became responsible for overseeing all primary education, special education and teacher training in Uruguay.\\"Renfrew (1999)\\", p 69 In 1983, she brought the Special Olympics to Uruguay and facilitated the country joining the international organization. Garc√≠a received many awards over her long career including a Kennedy Foundation Honor in 1966; the Award for Leadership in Mental Deficiency from the American Association on Mental Deficiency (Chicago, USA, 1976); Award of Merit from the Panamanian President's Committee on Mental Retardation (1975); Order of the Corbata Class A, Andr√©s Bello from the Government of Venezuela (Caracas, Venezuela, 1976); and an appointment by the Secretary General of the UN to participate in the \\"World Symposium of Experts on International Cooperation Programs for Disabled\\", awarded by the International Association for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency (India, 1985). In 1988 she was honored by the OAS with the Andr√©s Bello Award for her regional contributions to the education of the disabled; that same year she was awarded a medal from the Government of Ecuador for her efforts in special education; and the following year the University of Kansas created a scholarship through the Bureau of Child Research in her name, which is granted to professionals wishing to study early intervention and stimulation. She was President of the International League of Associations for Persons with Mental Handicap from 1986 to 1990. In that office oversaw the communications and international exchange between institutions of five continents was publicly recognized by President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, when she retired. The Uruguayan government renamed the Educational complex of Special Schools N¬∫203 and 280 in Montevideo after her in 1994 and in 1995, she received the Royal Association for Prevention and Care of Persons with Disabilities Reina Sofia Award for Rehabilitation and Integration in Madrid in 1995.

Main characters ; ; :The protagonist of the series, Motoko was adopted by three combat specialists after the death of her mother. Her \\"fathers\\" trained her in karate, swordsmanship, submission techniques, close quarters combat and the handling of firearms. As a result of the excessive physical and mental strain placed on young Motoko during her training, she developed three split- personalities, collectively known as \\"HiFuMi\\", as well as one called \\"Zero\\", who represents all her pent up rage. HiFuMi works to protect Motoko, and though she sees HiFuMi as a burden to her, wishing only to live a normal life, she knows they are just trying to look after her safety. Though Motoko could be a powerful combatant even without HiFuMi, her shy and passive nature often restricts her from making use of her fighting capacity. Though normal characters do not notice when she changes personalities, the subtle changes in Motoko's \\"Ki\\" occurs whenever a different personality takes control, which could be perceived by other sufficiently-skilled fighters. MRI scans done by Kannami have confirmed that Motoko's muscle structure is indeed very impressive. :Though initially wary, Motoko develops feelings for Kosukegawa and eventually starts dating him. One of her fathers unknowingly arranges for her to be married to Kosukegawa, but she turns the offer down as she wishes to fuse with Zero and HiFuMi before even considering marriage. Later, it is revealed that Motoko may not be the original personality, but merely a \\"host\\" personality, implying that the real Motoko might actually be Zero. The identity known as \\"Motoko\\" may have been constructed in order to handle everyday life while perceiving herself to be the true identity. At the end of the series, however, she is able to fuse with HiFuMi and return to a normal life with Kosukegawa. They later get married and in a final twist of fate have three daughters, who look like Hibiki, Fujiko and Mikiri. :;HiFuMi :\\"Hibiki\\", \\"Fujiko\\", and \\"Mikiri\\" (literally meaning \\"1 - 2 - 3\\") is a representation of Motoko's three personalities. They appear whenever Motoko experiences strong emotions, is in danger, or faints. In some cases, HiFuMi is capable of emerging simply when one of the personalities wants to get out. The three personalities are in constant communication with each other, but cannot communicate with Motoko. To solve this Motoko keeps a diary in which they can all write feelings and suggestions so Motoko can gain a better understanding of each personality and vice versa. The three of them are essentially representations of Motoko's \\"fathers\\". Each with their own specialty and characteristics. It is explained that each has their own physical characteristics set apart from the rest because of variant changes in muscle tones in the face and bodies they look similar, but not the same. Each physically represent a different physical build due to the unique training of each style. To further tell them apart each has a different hair style pertaining to them, as well as they seemed to be different hair colors, though it is not explained how that happens. They each develop their own unique a bond with Teruharu Kosukegawa. currently, because of Motoko's disappearance after remembering how her mother died, HiFuMi have taken up the duty of being Motoko while at school. However, in Volume 11 after they challenge both Hino and Ginga to an all out battle of 3 against 2, HiFuMi easily wins. They are shortly afterward caught by Kosukegawa and a teacher. Kosukegawa quickly thinks up an excuse for their fighting and apologizes on their behalf. Believing that they have caused Kosukegawa more than enough trouble, they decide to leave, possibly taking their Grandmother's offer, though states she would return soon. :* is an aggressive tomboy who is particularly skilled in karate and is represented by Red (attack). Her hair flows freely and equal and she is always looking for or instigating fights. Through her father's training she has always been known to take a head-on approach with anything, be it training (instead of dodging a log booby trap she instead chooses to punch through it), getting Kosukegawa to admit his feelings to Motoko (by kissing him and changing into her so he would finally kiss her), and even with her own feelings (as she kisses Kosukegawa for his birthday present, then stated she would give him something more for his next birthday), even fused with Zero she doesn't dodge attacks. Hibiki has deep feelings of love for Kosukegawa and admires how he is able to step forward though his fear when he must. To which she used as inspiration to give her 100% and conquer her own fears during a deadly battle. It is common for her to 'apologize' to Kosukegawa with a kiss or by offering herself to him. She finds the idea of being married, having a family and always being with Kosukegawa to be like a dream. She even goes so far as to even call him \\"darling\\". Hibiki is also shown of trying to encourage a sexual relationship with Kosukegawa. Be it giving hints of giving him \\"something more\\" for his next birthday or hoping he would jump on Mokoto after she comforted him. She even confirmed that she was planning to have sex with Kosukegawa for his birthday, but refrained from it since Motoko was anxious enough to faint from \\"only a kiss\\". Hibiki even shows jealousy when Kosukegawa is with Ginga or Izuru, to which she describes herself as though feeling her \\"head spinning\\" and her \\"heart pounding\\" whenever she sees him with them. Once after she lost a fight to Ginga in front of Kosukegawa she was so embarrassed to show her face to him that she didn't reveal herself for two months. Out of the three personalities, she is the most common to appear. She has the ability to 'stay out' from morning to night since she is the one most eager to jump into a fight. Hibiki is the first to kiss Kosukegawa and second to receive a date with him. When Hibiki witnessed Sora throwing Kosukegawa's cherished collection of Kamen Raider videos away, a ploy by Sora to have HiFuMi reveal the power of \\"black\\", she was overcome with rage. This triggers her first merger with Zero, and as a result of this merger she nearly kills Sora before Kosukegawa eventually intervened. In fact he was also nearly killed, when Hibki attempting to strangle him with the scarf HiFuMi and Motoko made for him for his birthday. It was only after realizing that she was not protecting Kosukegawa from crying, but was in fact the one making him cry, that Hibiki was finally able to take control over Zero. After the disappearance of Motoko, true to her head-on approach tries to bring her back by having a no holds brawl against Hino and Ginga. However, after defeating them realized even their level of fighting wasn't enough. :* is calm ‚Äî almost to the point of appearing cold-blooded ‚Äî and proficient in the use of weapons and represented by Blue (speed); indeed, she is the quickest of the four personalities, outside Zero herself. She is also the most mature and adult-like of the three personalities; hence, she is also the most analytical, almost to the point of being strategic. She doesn't seem to care for food that isn't nutritious in any way, but now has a liking for ice-cream because of Kosukegawa. Because of her marksman skills, she is a natural at video games, but tends to use a lot of ammo in shooting games as she was trained to shoot the head and the heart. She is shown to be stronger than Hibiki, whereas Hibiki lost to Ginga, Fujiko easily defeats Hino, who is the current Gadam, and therefore much stronger than Ginga. Though she states to Hino that she doesn't believe she is in love with Kouskegawa, she admits that she is fond of him, and that he is a very dear person to her. Some of her actions however point to Fujiko having very deep feelings for Kosukegawa. For example when she first meets Hino, she challenges her to see if she is strong enough to protect him. Also after seeing Kosukegawa stabbed and apparently mortally wounded by an American soldier, Fujiko was so enraged by the thought of losing him that she willfully fuses with Zero in order to avenge him and nearly kills the soldier by systematically shooting him in painful and non-lethal spots in order to prolong his pain before she kills him. But before she finishes him off she realizes that she truly does not wish to go against Kosukegawa's way of life. She manages to restrain Zero and spare the soldiers life as she clutches her precious blue topaz necklace Kosukegawa gave to her for her birthday. However moments later she learns that Kosukegawa's 'blood' was actually from a bottled vegetable drink that protected him from actually being harmed. She became very embarrassed to have gone so far over \\"spilt juice\\" and revealing so much of her feelings, which she usually keeps guarded. She is talented in homemaking skills, as she is a good cook to the point of near-perfection. Hibiki and Mikiri comically state she once melted a pot while preparing curry over the course of three days when only one night was required. As well, Hibiki stated that on the scarf they all made for Kouskegawa that the \\"professional\\" looking parts were done by Fujiko. Also, after Motoko's disappearance, both Mikiri and Hibiki have her do all the house work, for which they were chided by Kosukegawa. After controlling zero we learn what she truly wishes for is a life of her own. :* is the child-like expert in grappling and submission moves and represented by Yellow (defense). All Mikiri wants is to play like other children, although like a child, she can easily be scared into fainting and possesses child-like cruelty, showing excitement at the prospect of scratching and clawing a man's eyes out. A constant gag with Mikiri is that when she takes control, her body form changes (described by Motoko as a change in her muscle placement), inevitably increasing her bust size and causing anything less than a shirt (bra, bikini, etc.) to rip apart. She has a very large appetite, able to eat all 31 flavors of ice cream in a single sitting. Of the three personalities, she appears least often but, has the most active social life. 'Playing' with the neighborhood kids visiting \\"Granny\\". Has more of a child-like attraction towards Kosukegawa. Calling him Kosuke-niichan. Stating that she would miss playing with him if he was killed and wanted to take a bath with him on his birthday, upset at the fact that he fell asleep before she came out. When she was comforting Kosukegawa stating \\"You should always be who you are because that's why we (HiFuMi) love you so much\\". Mikiri would often visit an elderly neighbor of Motoko's whom she referred to as Granny, as the elderly woman would often make her ohagi to eat (an amount Motoko herself couldn't stomach). In chapter 41 Granny died, leaving one last batch of ohagi that Mikiri vowed to finish. When this batch of ohagi was dropped and ruined by would-be muggers, an enraged Mikiri fused with Zero to exact revenge, only to be brought back to her senses by the fact that she would have crushed Granny's ohagi if she had continued fighting. However, true to her child-like nature, Mikiri, joined by Kosukegawa, ate the ohagi off of the street, forcing the muggers to do the same. :* is the most dangerous of all her personalities and represented by Black (a mixture of all three colors). She is ruthless, emotionless (evident by the permanently vapid look on her eyes as she attacks), inhumanly strong to point of being able to tear off limbs, endure direct attacks without flinching she uses her forehead (even completely ignoring an opponent's hold that would have broken her arm), and will attack almost anyone she sees with intent to kill. She has all the skills of the other personalities as well as the capacity to utilize them with alarming coordination but she has no mercy for anyone, not even for Kuruma Takezou, one of the \\"Three Fathers\\" or Teruharu, taking Motoko and HiFuMi to hold her back from killing him, where when she first came out even as a little girl two of the \\"Three Fathers\\" were terrified to approach her even after she had passed out after 3 minutes She has all the traits of a natural born killer. Despite being by far the most powerful of Motoko's personalities, she has two condition that must be met before she can take over: 1) each of the three personalities that make up HiFuMi must be defeated before she comes to the surface, making her somewhat of a last resort for Motoko, and for HiFuMi to go through extreme anger. Such as seeing Kosukegawa being hurt severely. How she was named Zero was because that was the only word she has ever said, appearing to be a reference as HiFuMi means 1, 2 and 3, so when she is called out is like counting down (3, 2, 1, 0). However, if one of HiFuMi is experiencing extreme rage, Zero is able to fuse with them, giving them a strong boost of power but driving them into a controlled killing frenzy.Change 123: Chapter 36 As a side note, unlike HiFuMi, and Motoko, her breasts are the smallest, resembling more of a child-like body, a trait that has carried over to the members of HiFuMi she has fused with‚Äîas Fujiko and Mikiri fused with Zero, their physiques changed in turn to more closely resemble Zero's. Currently HiFuMi, Motoko, Two of the Three Fathers, Kosukegawa and Kannami are working on a way to remove Zero, who is essentially the hatred and rage of all of the personalities by having HiFuMi experience the joys of a normal life. It is also theorized by Kannami to Mokoto that she could fragment a new personality if she does not go through with the therapy. ; ; :Motoko's classmate who is a fan of (a pun on Shotaro Ishinomori's Kamen Rider) and looks to emulate the hero. He takes an instant liking to Motoko and goes to great lengths to protect Motoko's secret. Because of Kosukegawa's loyalty and self-sacrifice, HiFuMi feels some affection towards him. Since he knows of Motoko's situation, Kosukegawa serves as HiFuMi's liaison. He has admitted that he cares for all four of Motoko, but even to Hibiki's suggestion that he kiss her he turns her down as he first fell in love with first Motoko and, wants to confess to her first. He is uncommonly durable able to withstand painful injuries like being knocked into a river by a swinging log of wood without permanent injuries. He is shown to be a natural fighter. Stated by Ralph he has image training pat down. Where with only a few tips (and acupuncture to increase his strength and speed and a Kamen Raider suit as armor) he was able to briefly hold his own against Zero earning only a broken arm where trained assassins were nearly killed. He was advised to defeat her with a punch to the throat (the effectiveness of which remains unknown given HiFuMi's superhuman durability), but stopped himself as he couldn't bring himself to harm Motoko. As of the end of volume five, Kosukegawa, and Motoko begin to go out, but does not have the courage to hold hands, or any other close activity with her, yet has finally and happily been able to call her by her first name. This does not stop Kosukegawa from having perverted fantasies about her, to the point of saying \\"Where do you want to do it\\" instead of \\"Where do you want to go,\\" and gives off a perverted aura. It is shown that Kosukegawa gave Kannami, his childhood friend, an alloy version Kamen Raider Z-III because of the benefit the two would gain from having, and losing the figure. Though he is completely for the idea of marrying Motoko, more often than not his reasons behind so is because of all the perverted things they could do after. However, after realizing that Motoko could only be a Host personality, he became greatly depressed at the idea that if she was to fuse with Zero she would lose all memories of their time together. These thoughts seem to have dispelled after Motoko comforted him. His greatest fear is realized in Chapter 49 of volume 10. When, after Hibiki merges with Zero in order to exact revenge on Sora for her mistreatment of Kosukegawa, Motoko finally remembers her last memory of her mother before she died. Her last words to her mother before she is killed in her accident are \\" You can just die mother!\\" This terrible recollection cause Motoko to suddenly disappear without warning. He asks HiFuMi every chance he gets if she has return, but after Hibiki tearfully tells him they do not know what to do, he is taken aback by his insensitivity. Hugging Hibiki, he apologizes realizing that he isn't the only person feeling lonely and helpless. Later when he discovers HiFuMi has disappeared, he doesn't hesitate to immediately set off on a journey to discover their whereabouts. With a clue from Kannami, he sets off for Kyoto the place where her family is rumored to have been acting as highly sought after covert spies for generations. He could watch the final battle between the HiFuMi infused Zero against Tatsuya in order to find Motoko inside of them. They later get married and in a final twist of fate have three daughters, who look like Hibiki, Fujiko and Mikiri. Motoko's family ; :Nicknamed \\"The God of Submission\\", Takezou specializes in submission holds and grappling techniques. It is Kuruma's training that created the personality of Mikiri. He is a \\"good-natured\\" man that cares very deeply for his daughter's well being. Kuruma prefers to grapple his opponents either until submission or until knocking them unconscious (usually by cutting off circulation to the brain or by attacking the brain directly in attempt to shake it, which would result in instant unconsciousness). He also appears to have a liking to the Kamen Raider series, wearing a festival mask when first introduced. He is able to tell which of the four personalities his \\"daughter\\" is at any given time, which surprises Motoko. He is known to train any students who wish to learn his style of fighting, though he claims none have ever been able to complete their training besides a Russian woman, Anna, who he usually calls Anna-chan. He is shown to have a liking for Anna and sometimes uses his training with her for his own perversions, usually to comical effect. Kuruma is the most common of the Three Fathers to appear, even staying at Motoko's house for Christmas. ; :Nicknamed \\"Sword Saint\\", Jin is another one of Motoko's \\"fathers\\". He specializes in strategic combat and tactical weaponry. He is a master swordsman and regarded by many as a tactical genius. Hardly anything is known about his personal life other than that he used to be a special ops in the military. He is usually seen resting his sword against his shoulder and is also responsible for creating Fujiko. He aided Kanami in attempt to help fuse Zero with HiFuMi in hopes of eliminating Zero. He sees Zero as a threat to Motoko's safety. Like Fujiko he is hardly ever shown to reveal emotion, though he does care for Motoko. Stating what father does not wish for their daughters happiness. ; :Nicknamed \\"Tiger Killer Ryu\\", Tatsuya is the third \\"father\\" of Motoko to be revealed, he appeared only in flashbacks until volume eight. He is mainly a wanderer and is described the karate master that \\"defeated a tiger with his bare hands\\". He is also responsible for the creation of Hibiki. He is a specialist in empty-handed combat and known throughout the underworld as an 'untouchable' having taken vengeance on a number of gangs, mob bosses and professional fighters for slighting him. Like Hibiki, if there's a fight to be had he's always anxious to join in and has even been known to instigate fights, despite any odds. Ironically, it appears that outside of fighting he is actually a very nice person frequently seen with a pleasant grin on his face. Hibiki states that after sparring with him none of HiFuMi are able to move the next day, likewise, the other two fathers believe that he could fight Zero to the death as a draw, this arguably makes him the strongest out of the three fathers. Tatsuya is mainly responsible for arranging Motoko's engagement to Kosukegawa after he befriended Kosukegawa's father in hopes once she is married he may be free to wander. He is the only one of the \\"Three Fathers\\" that does not know about Zero, as the other two fathers believe he will try to draw her out intentionally for a fight to the death. It is noted that it has been two years since Motoko has even seen Tatsuya. On a comical note, the other two fathers think he is a moron. Contrary to their beliefs, he has revealed he is very smart, but only when it comes to fighting and when it involves his daughter. To comical effect, he can tell Hibiki apart even though she was pretending to be Motoko. He refers to Motoko and HiFuMi as his daughters and Kosukegawa as his son-in-law. Of the \\"Three Fathers\\", he is the least involved in Motoko's life, though ironically he's her registered guardian. He is actually Motoko's biological father although she also has genetic connections to the other two as well. He squares off against Hifumi in their attempt to awaken Motoko, knocking all three unconscious. ; :Motoko's mother who died in an accident when Motoko was very young. She was a great information retrieval expert but when she had Motoko she gave it all up and got a reputable job to take care of her. She met Kuruma, Jin and Rukawa when she was on assignment, working with them even though she would betray them once she got the info she needed. It is revealed in Chapter 49 that she was killed when a truck tipped over, causing the steel beams it was carrying to fall on her right in front of her daughter, inadvertently creating Zero. When Jin mentions meeting her, she resembles Hibiki the most but later in life her facial appearance was the same as the combination of Motoko and HiFuMi after the fight between Zero and Teruharu. Tatsuya Rukawa is Motoko's real father but she keep this info from the Gettou family, to keep their job a secret, is a fatherless society. It is implied that all three fathers still love her despite the fact she was the enemy. ; :First revealed in chapter 41, Sakura is Motoko's grandmother. Not much is known other than she looks very young for her age and is the mother to Motoko's biological mother Asagi. She employs many highly skilled martial artists. First was Botan to watch her granddaughter, then sent Kisaragi to watch over her, where Sora is only there for her own interest after hearing that there was a possessor of Black. She wants for Motoko to come live with her at the Gettou estate and work in the family business, which is similar to a ninja as they hide in the shadows and keep the peace in secret. However, to become a member Motoko would need to split off all ties with everyone she knows now, giving her a year to decide if she wants to or not. In the end, Motoko decided to remain outside after she fuses with HiFuMi. Kosukegawa family ;Kosukegawa's Mom :An oddly shaped woman who lives with her son as her husband works overseas. For some reason she appears to have a lack of interest towards her son, where when she first met Mokoto she stated her son had died, then when Ginga stated she was going back to her island she offered the idea for her son to leave so she could stay. Though she does love her husband, running to greet him in volume 8 after not seeing him for a long time. ;Kosukegawa's Dad :Usually working overseas, Kosukegawa's father isn't seen till volume 8 when he tells his son that he found him a fianc√©e. He (like his son) is a good hearted man who will risk his own safety to save someone who seems to be in danger (which is how he met Rukawa Tatsuya). He believed that his son was more into the Kamen Rider series to be interested in girls, which is why he set up the fianc√©e, but he is proud of his son and how he is able to solve a problem without resorting to violence. ; :A fourteen-year-old female Gada warrior of the Gigi Tribe, from the Solomon Islands. She possesses the Ten Fangs, the highest level among the Gada, directly below the village protector, 'Gadam'. She seems to be as strong as HiFuMi individually. She is currently living as a boarder in Kosukegawa's house as he first believed she was a he and he didn't want \\"him\\" to stay at Motoko's house. She has a large unknown bird of prey named Gyoutenmaru who she and Hino saved when they first met. Ginga is later shown to be Kosukegawa's relative, through his great grandfather who disappeared in World War II, much to his surprise, where since then she has lived with the Kosukegawa family and goes to high school. Though she is a girl, she doesn't like the fact that she is growing breasts, believing they just get in the way during a fight. But later, Mikiri informs her that her father Kuruma states that fat absorbs attacks better than muscle, which could explain why her breasts grow so large. She is also terrified of flying. She is usually seen hanging out with Aizawa. She defeated Sora's master but she was attacked in the neck by Sumire. In the end, she along with Hino and Gyoutenmaru watched Kosukegawa and the injured Motoko and Tatsuya return. Others ; :Another of Motoko's classmates and Kosukegawa's childhood friend, although the two are not as close as before. This is probably because of Kannami moving away to America two years after they met, therefore weakening their friendship. However, there are times, such as in chapter thirty-one, that Kannami enjoys being friends with Kosukegawa. Kannami enjoyed spending time with Kosukegawa because Kosukegawa was always able to see the possibilities in the most mundane places. Kannami is also very popular with the female student body, including Motoko. He is interested in HiFuMi, to the point where he pushed Motoko off the school's roof just so he could witness her transformation and hired professional fighters to bring out Zero. He is a prodigy and wanted by DARPA. Motoko (and Mikiri) seem to be enamored by him, causing Kosukegawa to get jealous. It is shown in chapter thirty-one that Kannamni accepted a Kamen Raider action figure from Kosukegawa because it would help him remember Kosukegawa since he was not fond of Kamen Raider at all. He warns Motoko that she could fragment a new personality if she doesn't go through with the therapy. And later, believes that Motoko is actually a \\"host\\" personality and not the real Motoko. ;Ralph Anderson :A young American Navy soldier current rank: Colonel. He is as big (if not bigger) fan of the Kamen Rider series like Kosukegawa. Because of an incident his father was killed lost his left arm. Kosukegawa and Motoko first meet him on a train where he recognized the Kamen Raider key chain Kosukegawa had. After he ate 5 bowls of rice. Before they parted ways Ralph gave Kosukegawa's watch (1st time). It is later discovered that Kannami hired him to help bring out Zero under the commands of Jin. He is a skilled strategist and has a prosthetic left arm, replacing the one he lost. ;Anna :A Russian woman currently being trained by Kuruma Takezou, one of the Three Fathers, though she also trained with Jin Hayase, another of the Three Fathers. She has the ability to memorize any attack after seeing it, but her weakness is that she lacks the skill to use it properly without proper training. Though Kuruma sometimes acts perverted around her, they both seem to harbor feelings for each other. She once teased Motoko by asking how she would feel if she was to get a \\"new brother, sister, or a foreign mother\\". She is shown to be a good cook of Russian style food, as she often prepares borscht. ; :A new transfer student to Saotome High School. Her dark skin and the reason for transferring (father's work) implied her as the most likely person to be 'Gadam', but in the end, it is shown to be Hino. She's tall, athletic, very popular with the other female students, and obsessed with discovering Motoko's secret. She dislikes her uncommon appearance, preferring not to stand out to the point where she is mistaken as a guy to some at first glance. After an incident where Kosukegawa protected her from a viper, it appears that she has started to grow feelings for him, even stating she wouldn't mind having his child. In chapter 37 she leaves without telling anyone so to not leave any attachments, but not before giving Kosukegawa her VHS/DVD player to replace his that she accidentally destroyed, her leaving her past behind being a condition she needed to fulfill to become a member of the Gettou family. She appears to have some connection with Motoko's grandmother as she states that Motoko with her separate personalities have achieved the three colors of martial arts, Red (Hibiki) for attack, Blue (Fujiko) for speed and Yellow (Mikiri) for defense. With this she has mixed all of them, achieving Black (Zero). Sora refers to her as nearly Red level; however from her tone she may be insulting her. She later returns to try to prevent Sora from unleashing Zero although she is stopped by an unknowing Kosukegawa. Eventually she is told by Sumire Kisaragi that she earned the right to call herself Red, having been able to break down the wall called laws. ; :Ginga's childhood friend on the island of the Gada. She came to the Gada Island because of her father's work as a map maker, creating maps so the people were able to get around the island safer. Although Hino became Gadam, and decided to wait for Ginga to challenge her, Hino eventually had to leave for Japan, effectively angering Ginga. Endowed, and beautiful, Hino is easily seen as a princess, and her personality is equivalent to her looks, as well as her fighting style; however, having been brought up by the Gada, Hino is prone to prepare rather bizarre cuisines, from hunting live animals to devouring them raw. She appears to be perceptive enough to at least know whenever a different personality (so far it's Fujiko) overrides Motoko's body, leaving the actual Motoko dormant, as seen during the times when Fujiko surfaced. Hino likes to avoid causing unnecessary pain, and therefore attacks the jaw to paralyze her opponents by using Aikido in battle and has fast reflexes. Hino is shown to be the Gadam of the Gada, though she no longer lives there it is still very dear to her and believes that she owes more to the Gada then she could repay in her lifetime. Surprisingly, she shares an interest in Kamen Rider, much to Kosukegawa's delight, and watches the series with him from time to time. However, it worries Motoko that he might like Hino more than her. After observing her skills in battle, Fujuko became interested in recruiting her as a means to keep Zero at bay should the dangerous personality re-surfaces once again, but knowing she couldn't just ask for assistance from a total stranger, she approached Hino in the guise of Motoko to briefly challenge her. Despite the whole fight being just a test, Fujiko proved to be the one victorious and it was then that Hino realized (as Fujiko pointed out) that her ability to perceive her surroundings from outside of her field of vision is not as honed as those on the front and sides (evident as Fujiko was able to snatch the ribbon tying Hino's hair after swiftly running past her, and it was only when Hino's har fell did she realized it), she even contemplated that she would have totally lost had Fujiko taken the fight seriously. Tsukishima comments on her talent to easily do things quickly just after being told, such as learning to read her opponent's rhythm. Sora deduces that she is a Light Brown martial artist (Yellow + Light Red + Light Blue). She defeats a member of the Gettou Family, but is attacked by Sumire, and sent by her to Tokyo but in Nagoya, she returned to retrieve Ginga and in the end, she along Gyoutenmaru and Ginga saw Kosukegawa with the injured Tatsuya and the returning Motoko. ;Naoko Watanabe(Áõ¥Â≠êÊ∏°Ëæ∫  Watanabe Naoko) :Daughter of a friend of Kosukegawa's father. ; :Aizawa was at first a punk attending school just to beat up the strongest one there. As he searched he met Ginga, who during this time believed he wanted to beat up the strongest to attain a title called \\"Guardian\\", which appears to be a term used for the protector of the school. After watching a fight between Mikiri and Ginga, he realized he is nowhere near as strong as he once believed. He is still very competitive when it comes to his fighting skills however, especially when it comes to Ginga, who often goads him into fighting. Though he seems not to really associate with anyone else at school as often as he does with Ginga, he often corrects others when they refer to them as being \\"close friends\\", instead stating profusely that they are only \\"classmates\\" and nothing more. When he feels that she's beginning to surpass him after their return to school after summer, he goes to Hino to help him train in Aikido. Though he hated the title of \\"Guardian\\" at first, he starts to embrace it during a fight that breaks out at a school festival and he stands up to the punks to protect the school. ; :The new nurse at Saotome High School for the rest of the semester. Most of the male students find her very attractive. She works for Motoko's grandmother and is there to keep her eyes on Motoko, even going as far as to nearly kill Sora for attacking her, despite them both working for the Gettou Family. She has some memories of Motoko's mother back when she was a little girl. She finally reveals she is a representative of Sakura Gettou to Motoko after Hibiki's fight with Sora, informing her that she could live her life without any persecution if she joined the Gettou family. However, informed her she must sever all ties with everyone she is close to do so, and gave her a year to make her decision. She alters the memory of the intruders of the family and she attacks them in the neck with a taser. She was attacked by behind by Botan Tsukishima and Sumire before losing consciousness, she tells Botan that she achieve the Red Level. ; :Another person who works for Motoko's grandmother. Her main weapon seems to be a key chain with razor-sharp keys connected to a wire, which she uses like a rope dart. Not much else is known about her other than the fact she doesn't know who the possessor of Black looks like and challenges Hino. After the fight and assuming Botan was wrong, she sets her sights on Motoko as she has the same family name as the Head. Sora can be ruthless when it comes to getting what she wants, going as far as to hire a biker gang (offering them either money or even her own body) to attack the school. Later she even takes advantage of Kosukegawa kind nature to get to Motoko, as she figured out that he seems to be able to make her change personalities, making sure to kiss him right when she showed up and throwing away Kosukegawa's prized Kamen Raider video collection, which Motoko and HiFuMi knew he cherished very much. However, she is nearly killed by a Zero infused Hibiki because of this. She mentions she has a brother in kindergarten when watching Motoko and Kosukegawa's date. She states she is a Green (Yellow+Blue) martial artist. However, for being a Green martial artists means she lacks any way of attacking, relying solely on her keys for offense, which makes her virtually defenseless when she is waiting for them to return to her. She appeared in the end, seesighting the Tokyo Tower.

Biography Born in Mumbai (then Bombay), Duggan took a licentiate in medicine from the Grant Medical College in 1904, and joined the staff of the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Ophthalmic Hospital in Mumbai in 1906 as clinical registrar and tutor in ophthalmology. From 1908 to 1912, he studied in Vienna, Wiesbaden and in London under several eminent ophthalmologists, including Hermann Pagenstecher and Edward Treacher Collins, receiving a doctorate in the field from Oxford University in 1912. He then returned to Mumbai, where he established a large practice and became the medical superintendent of the Sir C.J. Hospital. During the First World War, Duggan served as an Indian Medical Service officer, and was the consultant ophthalmic surgeon to the designated wartime hospitals in Mumbai. He was appointed a justice of the peace in Mumbai in 1916, becoming a magistrate in 1918. Also in 1918, he was elected a Fellow of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Bombay, being appointed a Fellow of the University of Bombay the same year. He was awarded the honorary rank of major in the Indian Medical Service on 8 November 1919. In 1923, he was appointed a professor of ophthalmology at the Sir C.J. Ophthalmic Hospital, remaining in this position until his retirement in 1939. During his tenure, he greatly raised the standards of teaching and efficiency at the hospital. Duggan was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Indian Army medical officer reserves on 3 January 1929, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Birthday Honours list in June of that year. In the same year, Duggan introduced higher degrees and diplomas in ophthalmology at both the University of Bombay and the Bombay College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1933 Birthday Honours list, and received a knighthood in the 1935 New Year Honours list. In 1934, Duggan was elected President of the All-India Ophthalmological Society and the President of the Bombay College of Surgeons and Physicians. He was also a frequent contributor to the British Journal of Ophthalmology, serving as its editorial correspondent in Bombay for many years. He retired from the IMS in 1939 with the brevet rank of colonel. Duggan served as Sheriff of Mumbai in 1942. During the Second World War, he served as Chair of the Bombay Provincial Joint War Committee of the Indian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance, in which capacity he was recognised by his promotion to the rank of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1945 Birthday Honours list. In 1950, he became the Asian representative on the International Council of Ophthalmology. He died on 15 January 1957, aged 72. Personal life In 1914, Duggan married Jina (c. 1896-1993); the couple had two sons. Lady Duggan was herself awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal for public service in the 1934 Birthday Honours. In her later role as chair of the Indian Red Cross Women's Council for Bombay, she was awarded a rare second Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal in the final Indian honours list in 1947. Lady Duggan survived her husband by 35 years, dying in Mumbai in September 1993. Following her death, her daughter-in-law contested her will, in which Lady Duggan left the Duggan family's palatial 37,000 sq. ft. Mumbai bungalow, \\"Lawnside,\\" to her grandson Dr. Feroze Duggan; the will was contested on the grounds that Lady Duggan, who had been 96 years old when she made her will, would not have been in a sound state of mind at the time. The case dragged through the courts until August 2011, when the Bombay High Court ruled that a testator's advanced age by itself did not indicate a lack of sound mind, and affirmed the legality of Lady Duggan's will. Though the bungalow was in a state of disrepair by 2011, the property was then worth over INR ‚Çπ150 crore (roughly US$30 million), or today.

He was buried in Tomb EA14 in the southern group of the Amarna rock tombs.Amarna Project: The South Tombs (PDF)N. de G. Davies - The Rock Cut Tombs of El Amarna. Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities, 2004 (). Norman de Garis Davies originally published details of the Tomb in 1908 in the Rock Tombs of El Amarna, Part V ‚Äì Smaller Tombs and Boundary Stelae. The tomb dates to the late 18th Dynasty.Davies, Norman de Garis. The Rock Tombs of El Amarna. Part V ‚Äì Smaller Tombs and Boundary Stelae. London, 1908. Facsimile in Internet Archive Biography May declares that the King was the one who raised him up from humble beginnings. : I was a poor man on both my father's and my mother's side; but the ruler built me up, he developed me, he fed me by means of his spirit (ka) says the king's fan-bearer, May.Kemp, Barry, The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People, Thames and Hudson, 2012 May held a variety of titles. He held the title of iry-pat (prince), and he was a royal chancellor, a sole companion, scribe of the King and the Overseer of all the works of the King. His military titles include Overseer of the soldiery of the Lord of the Two lands and scribe of recruits. He was also the Overseer of the house of Sehetep-Aten. This title also appears on ostraca found in Amarna and may refer to a royal person or a temple. May was also the Overseer of the House of Waenra in On, and the Overseer of the cattle of the temple of Ra in On. These positions would have made him responsible for some of the aspects of temple life in Heliopolis. May may be the same person as the treasurer named Maya, who served Tutankhamen. May shares some of the titles with Maya, but he was not a treasurer.Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter-Reformation. The American University in Cairo Press. 2009, Tomb This large tomb was filled with sand and initially not excavated by Bouriant in 1883. The tomb was later excavated by Barsanti and the texts were published by Daressy. The entrance of the tomb leads to a pillared hall. Only the pillars in the center have been completed. The space is much damaged by both bats and a possible fire. The entrance of the tomb provides a scene where Akhenaten and Nefertiti are presenting a censer and libations to the Aten. The royal couple are followed by three of their daughters and the Queen's sister Mutbenret. The latter is accompanied by two dwarfs who are named Para and Re-neheh. In other scenes May is shown praying. Davies mentions that May's name has been excised and his image destroyed. The west wall of the hall contains an interesting scene. It was started in ink and not finished, but appears to show the reward of May at the balcony of the palace. The scene includes a building and what appears to be a Window of Appearance. Below that we see vegetation and the river's edge. Men are shown working with oars and fisher nets. Landings are depicted with at one landing the barge of the King, and at the other the barge of the Queen. These barges are distinguished by both their size and the heads of the royals. The barge of Akhenaten shows his head wearing an Atef crown on top of the steering paddle. The barge of Nefertiti is decorated with her head wearing the double plumes.

History In late 1939, Irish composer Havelock Nelson was instrumental in founding the Dublin Junior Orchestra with a view to providing young players of classical music with the opportunity to gain orchestral experience.Barra Boydell: \\"Dublin Orchestral Players\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White & Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013). It gave its first concert on 5 June 1940 in the Abbey Lecture Hall. The orchestra grew rapidly under Nelson and adopted the name Dublin Orchestral Players for its second concert the following year. When Nelson left Dublin in 1943, Brian Boydell became permanent honorary conductor, a position he held until 1966. Fred O'Callaghan conducted the orchestra between 1967 and 1971. Thereafter the orchestra adopted a policy of offering opportunities for a wider range of younger conductors, but O'Callaghan frequently returned to conduct individual concerts up until 1995. Other conductors have included Robert Houlihan, David Carmody, and Fergus Sheil. Since then, principal conductors have been David Brophy (1998‚Äì2001), Adele O'Dwyer (2001), Cathal Garvey (2002‚Äì2006), and Ciaran Crilly (since 2007).Information from website, http://www.dublinorchestralplayers.com/pb/wp_059af2db/wp_059af2db.html (retrieved 11 July 2015). Role in Irish musical life During the 1940s, before the establishment of the Radio √âireann Symphony Orchestra (R√âSO), the DOP supplied the demand in Dublin for symphonic music at a time when few orchestral concerts were otherwise available. The orchestra gave the Dublin premi√®res of many standard classics, including Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no. 5 and Mozart's Bassoon Concerto (both in 1944) and, remarkably, the first concert performance outside Russia of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf (9 June 1942). Under Boydell's direction the DOP had a policy of promoting music by contemporary Irish composers. For many years the orchestra included an Irish work in every programme and featured a number of premi√®res of Irish compositions including works by Boydell. The DOP has also provided opportunities to launch young solo performers, as when Hugh Maguire made his first public solo appearance on 16 June 1949. The enlargement of the R√âSO in 1948 replaced the DOP's pre-eminent role in providing orchestral concerts with those of a professional standard, and the founding of other amateur orchestras during the later twentieth century complemented and developed its work. The DOP regularly gives three concerts annually in Dublin and occasionally performs outside the capital. It also pioneered bringing orchestral music to schools in the provinces.

The bricks were sourced from local brickyards (a major 19th- century industry in Berlin), and its brickwork was of unusually high quality. It had terra cotta frieze panels depicting a variety of subjects, including St. George slaying the dragon. In the 1930s, a major addition was made to house the private Jean E. Hooker School.

He was an ardent worshipper and ascetic. Biography Not many details about his early life are known except that he was born in Yemen which is why he was often regarded as \\"Yemeni\\". His name was Abdul Wahid and he was the son of Shaikh Abdul Aziz Tamimi bin Haris bin Asad. ‚ÄòTamimi‚Äô was a part of his name as his family belonged to the tribe al-Tamimi of Arabia.

HMS Magnet served during the War of 1812 as a prison ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Royal Navy eventually renamed her Attentive, possibly in 1814 when the Navy acquired Sir Sydney Smith, which it renamed Magnet. Then as Attentive she served as a store ship, still apparently on the Halifax station, before she sailed to Britain in 1816. She was broken up in January 1817. The records on this vessel are sparse, and somewhat contradictory. Winfield states that she was a privateer, but the most comprehensive list of American privateers, that of Emmons, does not list a privateer named Magnet.. The records of the Halifax Vice admiralty court for the War of 1812 do list a Magnet. She was a ship of 172 tons (bm), T. Drew, master, that Ringdove captured on 18 July 1812 as Magnet was sailing from Belfast to New York City. She was carrying passengers and a small amount of linens. The records state that Magnet was \\"Taken into possession for the use of the King's service.\\"Vice Admiralty court, p. 136, - accessed 11 July 2015. However, Magnets burthen is not consistent with that of HMS Attentive. Curiously, the same Vice admiralty records show that captured Marquis de Somerlous on 10 July 1812. Marquis de Somerlous was a ship of 359 tons (bm), the only one of that burthen on the Vice admiralty's records. Under the command of T. Moriarty, master, she had been sailing from Civitavecchia to Salem, Massachusetts, with a cargo of brandy, wines, silks, and dry goods when Atalanta captured her.Vice Admiralty court, p. 137, - accessed 11 July 2015.

As a two-year-old he showed very good form, winning the Gimcrack Stakes and finishing third in both the July Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. He began his three-year-old career with a win in the Greenham Stakes before emerging as a leading sprinter with victories in the Commonwealth Cup, July Cup, Prix Maurice de Gheest and British Champions Sprint Stakes. Background Muhaarar is a bay horse with a white coronet on his right hind foot bred in the United Kingdom by his owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. He was sired by Oasis Dream, a sprinter who won the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2003 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Midday and Power. Muhaarar's dam Tahrir won two races in Britain as a three- year-old in 2003. Tahrir was a descendant of the broodmare Triumphant, who was a half-sister to Relkino. The colt was sent into training with Charles \\"Charlie\\" Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire. The name Muhaarar is Arabic for \\"liberated\\". Racing career 2014: two-year-old season Muhaarar made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over five and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 May. Starting the 5/6 favourite, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and accelerated away from his opponents to win by four lengths from Red Connect. The colt was moved up in class to contest the Group Two July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 10 July and finished third behind Ivawood and Jungle Cat with Belardo in fourth. Sixteen days later he started 2/1 joint favourite for the listed Winkfield Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse and finished third again, beaten one and a half lengths and three quarters of a length by Kodi Bear and Disegno. On 23 August, Muhaarar, ridden by Paul Hanagan, started at odds of 7/1 for the Group Two Gimcrack Stakes over six furlongs at York. The Norfolk Stakes winner Baitha Alga started favourite ahead of Jungle Cat, Beacon (Dragon Stakes) and the Irish challenger Accepted. Hanagan tracked the leaders before moving up to challenge inside the final furlong. Muhaarar caught Jungle Cat in the final strides and won by a nose. Hills commented \\"He has always shown plenty and it is nice when it falls into place though. It never really worked last time and Paul has given him a lovely ride today. He is growing up and is in plenty of the top class races for the rest of the year.\\" On his final appearance of the season, Muhaarar ran in the Group One Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on 17 October. After leading for most of the way he was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Charming Thought and Ivawood. 2015: three- year-old season =Spring campaign= On his three-year-old debut, Muhaarar started a 16/1 outsider for the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury. Ivawood was made the favourite in a nine-runner field which also included Belardo (Dewhurst Stakes), Estidhkaar (Champagne Stakes) and Dick Whittington (Phoenix Stakes). With Hanagan opting to ride Estidhkaar, Muhaarar was ridden by the Italian-born veteran Frankie Dettori. After being bumped at the start, he settled in mid- division before making progress in the last quarter mile. He took the lead in the last hundred yards and won by a neck from Estidhkaar with the pair finishing four and a half lengths clear of Ivawood in third. After the race Hills said \\"We always knew he was a good horse but there was always going to be a question mark about the trip....Frankie thinks the French Guineas would suit him well and it will be Sheikh Hamdan's decision. The 2,000 Guineas has to be on the agenda.\\" The winning time of 1:20.80 was a new course record. For his next race, Muhaarar was sent to France and moved up in distance for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. After pulling hard in the early stages he made some progress in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished eighth of the eighteen runners behind Make Believe. =Commonwealth Cup= Muhaarar was brought back to sprint distances for the inaugural running of the Commonwealth Cup, a race for three- year-olds over six furlongs at Royal Ascot on 19 June. The American-trained Hootenanny (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf) started favourite ahead of Limato (Pavilion Stakes) and Tiggy Wiggy whilst the other runners included Anthem Alexnder (Queen Mary Stakes), Adaay (Sandy Lane Stakes), Kool Kompany (Prix Robert Papin, Craven Stakes), Jungle Cat, New Providence (Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes), Home of the Brave (European Free Handicap) and Goken (Prix du Bois). Hanagan chose to ride Adaay and so the ride on Muhaarar went to Dane O'Neill. O'Neill settled the colt in mid-division before moving up to challenge for the lead approaching the final furlong. Muhaarar accelerated clear of the field to win by three and three quarter lengths from Limato with Anthem Alexander taking third ahead of the outsiders Salt Island and Profitable. Following the colt's victory, Hills said \\"This horse is improving and he's very versatile. He's got better with racing... He has got the world at his feet\\". O'Neill said \\"It was all very easy, it was a bit surreal. He didn't half pick up\\". =July Cup= On 10 July Muhaarar was matched against older sprinters for the first time in the July Cup at Newmarket. Anthem Alexander was again in opposition but his most serious challenge appeared to come from the Australian colt Brazen Beau the winner of the Newmarket Handicap. The other runners included the veteran Sole Power, G Force (Haydock Sprint Cup), Danzeno (Chipchase Stakes), Tropics (Bengough Stakes), Muthmir (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne), Astaire (Middle Park Stakes) and Jack Dexter (Chipchase Stakes). Starting 2/1 joint favourite with Brazen Beau and ridden by Hanagan he was settled behind the leaders before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. He produced a strong late run to catch the leader Tropics in the final stride and won by a nose, with the 50/1 outsider Eastern Impact taking third ahead of Sole Power and Danzeno. Hanagan commented \\"It was a bit too close for comfort, to be honest... He just didn‚Äôt handle the dip at all and the only time I could really give him his head was when he met the rising ground at the end. As soon as I let him go he really took off.\\" =Prix Maurice de Gheest= Muhaarar was sent to France for his next race, the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 9 August. Ridden again by Hanagan he started favourite ahead of the filly Esoterique who had won the Prix Rothschild and finished second to Solow in the Queen Anne Stakes. The other contenders included Ivawood (Richmond Stakes), Gordon Lord Byron (Haydock Sprint Cup, George Ryder Stakes), Son Cesio (Prix de Ris-Orangis), Fontenalice (Premio Dormello) and Coulsty (Prix de Meautry). Muhaarar was among the leaders from the start before taking the lead 150 metres from the finish and won by half a length from Esoterique, with Gordon Lord Byron another half length away in third place. Commenting on the colt's future targets, Hills said \\"Obviously we need to see how he comes out of this, but whatever happens, looking further ahead I wouldn't mind having a crack at the Breeders' Cup Mile\\". =British Champions Sprint Stakes= On 17 October, Muhaarar started 5/2 favourite in a twenty-runner field for the British Champions Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot in which he was attempting to win a fourth consecutive Group One race. His main rival in the betting market was Twilight Son an undefeated colt who had won the Haydock Sprint Cup on his most recent start. Adaay, Gordon Lord Byron, Danzeno, Coulsty and Jack Dexter were again among his opponents along with Maarek (Prix de l'Abbaye), Strath Burn (Hackwood Stakes), Naadirr (Cammidge Trophy), Lightning Moon (Bengough Stakes), Eastern Impact (Bengough Stakes) and the improving handicapper The Tin Man. After tracking the leaders down the centre of the course, Muhaarar took the lead approaching the final furlong and quickly established a clear advantage. Twilight Son finished strongly on the stands side but the result was never in doubt as Muhaarar won by two lengths. Danzeno finished third ahead of The Tin Man and Naadirr. Hills said \\"He's been very straightforward. He certainly has the will to win and he's got a beautiful temperament and great looks. He's gone a little bit in his coat in the past two days, but I think that was a career best\\". Hamdan Al Maktoum ruled out a challenge for the Breeders' Cup, saying that the tight turns at Keeneland would not suit the colt's racing style. Hills accepted the owner's decision but said that in his opinion the colt would have coped with the course. The Racing Post rated the performance the best by a European sprinter since 2011, and ranked him as the third-best three-year-old colt of the season behind Golden Horn and American Pharoah. Assessment and awards On 10 November 2015, Muhaarar was named Cartier Champion Sprinter at the 25th edition of the Cartier Racing Awards. Stud career At the end of his three- year-old season, Muhaarar was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at his owner's Nunnery Stud at Thetford in Norfolk.

He was born in South Moor, County Durham and died in the city of Durham. Collin was a left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, though in a county team that inclouded the England Test bowler George Paine, also a slow left-arm spinner, and the leg-breaks and googlies of Eric Hollies, he was never more than an occasional bowler. He appeared first in eight matches in the 1933 season, and \\"showed real promise\\", according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's review of the season, though he did not reach 50 in any innings. He was again an irregular player in 1934, but at the start of the 1935 season he played a match-saving innings of 105 not out and shared a seventh wicket partnership of 199 with Tom Dollery, who also made his maiden century, in the game against Gloucestershire; the partnership remains in 2015 Warwickshire's highest for that wicket against Gloucestershire. He did not manage to build on this start to the season, however, although his fielding was exceptional: the South African Cyril Vincent dropped his bat and stood to applaud the catch Collin took to dismiss him at square leg in the touring team's game at Edgbaston. He was not successful in the 1936 season and at the end of the year he left the Warwickshire staff. Collin returned to North East England in 1937 and for the next 39 years he was the cricket coach at Durham School. He played a few Minor Counties matches for Durham between 1938 and 1946.

Modern Pascal applications are written in Pascal/Object Pascal, and can be run within the Modern Pascal runtime on Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and DOS/32 operating systems. Its work is hosted and supported by the 3F, LLC and partner MP Solutions, LLC. Modern Pascal provides a blocking I/O API technology commonly used for operating system applications. Modern Pascal CodeRunner contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.  History  Modern Pascal was invented in 2000 by Ozz Nixon while also co-developing DXJavaScript with Alexander Baronovski. Ozz was inspired by the Kylix project in 1999 where he met with Borland's Pascal Team and shared his programming language \\"Modern Pascal\\". Ozz ported his commercial socket suite DXSock to Kylix then started developing Modern Pascal so he run pascal scripts on Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X. In 2002, Version 1.1 was released. Modern Pascal v1.1 was capable of running most Turbo Pascal (DOS) syntax. This was the last version using Variants internally as variable and code instances. Version 1.1 introduced support for built-in RTL units, allowing developers to extend the language grammar to support CRT/Display and TCP/IP Socket calls. In 2005, Version 1.2 was released. Modern Pascal v1.2 was available for 64bit platforms, with native 64bit binaries and internal support for 64bit numbers and memory addresses. In 2007, Version 1.3 was released. Modern Pascal v1.3 added cross-platform support for dynamic libraries, .so, .dylib, .DLL. This was the first version capable of developing native Windows GUI Applications, along with Linux Qt GUI Applications. By supporting external libraries the language was no longer limited to the command line or web server script engine role. In 2008, Version 1.4 was released. Modern Pascal v1.4 had a fork internally called DECLAN (DECisioning LANguage) for use in the credit and financial industry. Version 1.4 also introduced TDataset compatibility with the Borland Delphi compiler along with the ability to connect to databases via built-in ODBC support. This allows Modern Pascal to leverage almost all SQL database engines for Command Line and Web solutions. In 2009, Version 1.5 was released. Modern Pascal v1.5 was a redesign of the parser phase Lexicon. This is the first version where Modern Pascal started to incorporate syntax from other popular languages like +=, -=, *-, /= from C/JavaScript. Version 1.5 was now available as a native Apache Module for Windows, Linux and OS X. In 2010, Version 1.6 was released. Modern Pascal v1.6 incorporates more built-in RTL units: Ciphers, Compressions, Hashs. This version truly focused on migrating applications to web and needed built in support for common ciphers, hashes and compression algorithms used by RESTful applications. In 2011, Version 1.7 was released. Modern Pascal v1.7 was a redesign of the Apache Module. From this release forward Modern Pascal was no longer built into the Apache Module. Modern Pascal Celerity was introduced, inspired by the design of ColdFusion nTier back end to web servers. This means in a future release FastCGI, ISAPI and even old CGI and NSAPI interfaces could be deployed. Version 1.7 also introduced an old Pascal 3.0 feature called Chaining in a slightly more modern style. In 2013, Version 1.8 was released. Modern Pascal v1.8 introduced support for Delphi-like Classes, Smart Records, Unions and Self Instantiation. Version 1.8 was the first version where Modern Pascal started to truly become its own Pascal Dialect. In 2014, Version 1.9 was built but not released to the public. Modern Pascal v1.9 was used to develop DevelopIP, a large scale public web site. In 2015, Version 2.0 has begun. Modern Pascal 2.0 is a fork of lape. While previous versions were fast and efficient, they were not fast enough for some of the larger customers. Current benchmarks show v2.0 is processing over 100 million instructions a second - roughly 8 times faster than version 1.9, and much faster than Alternative Pascal script engines. July 2015, Modern Pascal 2.0 enters its final private Beta cycle. The team is actively porting code snippets and old applications to 2.0 and publishing the code on Github. In 2017, Version 2.0 has been released to the public, it now includes native dBase III+, IV, V, VII, Clipper and FoxPro support. During the past 24 months of development, 3F has ported to Github, Source to 17 BBSes (including QuickBBS, TPBoard, Hermes), BinkP (Fidonet) Protocol, multiple Tossers, Adventure Game Studio (1984), Custom Micro Solutions, Inc. Accounting and Point of Sale Software, Web RIA Applications. 3F also introduced transparent support for Extended ASCII, ANSI and UTF8 graphics.  Overview  Modern Pascal Command Line Interface allows you to create and run DOS like applications, using Pascal and the decades of free pascal source code, you can implement and run a wide range of business classes, and command utilities. Modern Pascal Celerity allows you to create similar solutions as a stand-alone middleware or backend engine. Combined with the Apache Module, Celerity can be used to create a wide range of web script solutions. Modern Pascal CodeRunner allows you to create standalone networking tools, including web servers, email servers, chat servers. CodeRunner manages TCP communications for your code, even TLS/SSL. As a developer you simply focus on what happens after a connection is established.  Code Sample  program Game.Loot.Example; uses Math; const MaxProbability=1000; type LootType=(Bloodstone, Copper, Emeraldite, Gold, Heronite, Platinum, Shadownite, Silver, Soranite, Umbrarite, Cobalt, Iron, Nothing); Looter = Class Probabilites:Array[0..12] of Longint; Choose:private function:LootType of object; AsString:private function(l:LootType):String of object; End; function Looter.Choose:LootType; var Loop,randomValue:Word; Begin randomValue:=Random(MaxProbability-1); Loop:=0; While Probabilites[Loop mod 13] OUTPUT Shows a random list of loot that could be found while navigating a maze/map game. Replaced the original code sample with something that is easier to read/follow. Hello World Because we can run Turbo Pascal syntax, the Hello world program of ModernPascal be coded the same as normal Pascal \\"Hello World\\". program HelloWorld; begin Writeln('Hello, World!'); end. ModernPascal also supports Brief Pascal, so you can execute statements without all the formality. Writeln('Hello, World!');  Built-in Units  In Pascal speak, a reusable collection of methods is referred to as a Unit, other languages often call these modules or libraries. Modern Pascal has built-in units to handle display, environment calls like file system I/O, sockets for networking TCP, binary data (buffers), classes and objects, cryptography functions, data streams, regular expression, collections, logging, configuration files using ini, csv or sdf (similar to csv) formats, databases through ODBC, built-in dBase, Clipper and FoxPro, and other core functions.  Dependencies  Modern Pascal operates without requiring any third-party libraries. Modern Pascal can optionally require OpenSSL to achieve TLS/SSL listeners and clients.  Files Included  * Modern Pascal Commercial Compiler: mpc (windows: mpc.exe) * Modern Pascal Command Line Interface: mp2 (windows: mp2.exe) * Modern Pascal RTL Engine (for compiled scripts): mpx (windows: mpx.exe)  On OS X and Linux(es) the compiled script contains !#/bin/mpx - to self run! * Modern Pascal Celerity: celerity2 (windows: celerity2.exe) * Modern Pascal Apache Module for Celerity: mod_pascal.so (windows: mod_pascal.dll) * Modern Pascal CodeRunner: coderunner2 (windows: coderunner2.exe)  Threading  Modern Pascal operates using a single thread model, using blocking I/O calls. Celerity and CodeRunner are self-threading engines allowing Modern Pascal itself to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections. The design of a single thread for each instance of code means it can be used to build highly reliable applications. The design goal of a Modern Pascal application is that any skill level of programmer should be able to operate without fear of memory leak, variable collision between threads, etc. This approach allows for scaling with the number of CPU cores of the machine it is running. The negative of this approach is the increase in thread switching contexts, however, Modern Pascal has been tested on a base Dell laptop handling over 50,000 concurrent connections/scripts.

Caf√© Mondegar and Mondy's) is a popular landmark and touristic attraction of Mumbai. Famous Indian cartoonist and painter Mario Miranda painted murals (his cartoons) on all inner walls and entrance ceiling of the restaurant. History Cafe Mondegar was started in 1932 by Iranian Zoroastrians (Parsi settlers in India) as an Irani caf√©. The current building (Metro House), then housed a hotel called Apollo Hotel and the caf√© was started in the reception area of the hotel. By the mid 20th century, the caf√© introduced a jukebox, (first in Mumbai) and was simultaneously converted into a restaurant. By the 1990s, Cafe Mondegar was refurbished, Mario Miranda's murals were painted on the walls & ceiling, and the restaurant was converted into a bar. Caf√© is owned by Yazdegardi family and Rusi Yazdegardi / Hoshang Yazdegardi are the Managing partners of the business. Location Cafe Mondegar is situated in the Metro House in Colaba Causeway, 450 meters North- West of Gateway of India, 200 meters North-East of Leopold Cafe and 400 meters South of Elphinstone College in Mumbai. Murals In the 1990s, Rusi Yazdegardi (owner) asked Mario Miranda to draw murals (cartoons) on two opposite walls; i.e. wall adjacent to the main entrance and wall opposite the main entrance. Both walls have different themes. Whilst one wall is dedicated to Life in Mumbai, the other wall is dedicated to Atmosphere in the Caf√©. Mario Miranda sketched his drawings on canvas before their being rendered on the restaurant walls with the help of students from Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art under his supervision.

This is yet another attempt to replicate the success of Conquistador. Another big theme song (\\"Battlestar Galactica\\"), a couple of originals, a blast from the past (\\"Stella by Starlight\\"), and a cover of \\"Birdland\\", which was well received.  Background and production  In preparing for this album, Maynard proved once again just how keenly aware he was of what was going on in the world of music (\\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Baker Street\\" had become hits mere months before entering the studio, and \\"Birdland\\" was still growing in popularity after its debut the year before), but he was having trouble converting these sensibilities into chart success. Having taken over the reins as producer, he hedged his bets by including a couple of songs from his past, re-recording the Slide Hampton arrangement of \\"Stella by Starlight\\" (originally on his 1959 release \\"A Message from Birdland\\", which featured Joe Zawinul in one of his earliest US appearances), and a new arrangement of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (the original was recorded for the 1956 release \\"Dimensions\\", after recording it as part of Charlie Barnet's band years before).  Critical reception  AllMusic's Scott Yanow wrote \\"Maynard Ferguson's version of \\"Birdland\\" from this LP was a bit of a hit and he fares fairly well on \\"Stella by Starlight\\" and \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" but overall this typically commercial Columbia album is of lesser interest.\\"  Reissues  In 2003, Carnival was reissued by Wounded Bird Records.

The hotel, which had 225 rooms in three stories, was built in a High Victorian style. Construction cost approximately $500,000. At the time, it was one of the most important hotels in Southern California.  Land Acquisition  When Don Miguel Dominguez died in 1882, he owned a massive parcel of land, Rancho San Pedro, which was passed on to his six daughters. A portion of that land, known as the \\"Ocean Tract\\", went to three of his daughters, Susana, Guadalupe and Maria de Los Reyes Dominguez. In 1889, this 433 acre Ocean Tract was sold for $12,000 to two Oregon steamship operators and entrepreneurs, Robert Thompson and Captain John Ainsworth. Looking to expand their growing company, \\"The Oregon Navigation Company\\", Thompson and Ainsworth formed the Redondo Beach Company and promoted and developed the area as a tourist destination, as well as, a port for their fleet.  Origins of the Hotel  As America approached the 20th Century, the town of Redondo Beach had just been incorporated and was determined to become a worldly destination. Located on the southern shores of the Santa Monica Bay, it had a large submarine canyon allowed wooden cargo ships, with their deep hulls, to get close enough to the coast to offload their goods onto train cars waiting on one of the several wharfs along the beach. Los Angeles was booming and in need of a port to funnel goods into the local marketplaces. Rail lines connected Redondo Beach to downtown businesses and the return trains brought thousands of people to this coastal paradise. Thompson and Ainsworth decided a grandiose hotel was needed to accommodate the growing numbers of passenger ships and to further support their efforts of enticing tourists and commerce to visit Redondo Beach.  Planning and Construction  In the later months of 1887, the Redondo Beach Company, responsible for managing construction of the Hotel Redondo, posted advertisements in the Los Angeles Herald newspaper calling on architects to submit plans for building a \\"Large First-Class hotel to be equal in all respects to the Del Monte in Monterey\\". A premium price of $1000 was to be paid to the selected architect. In January 1888, notices were advertised in the Los Angeles Herald for contractors to submit proposals for excavating 30,000 cubic yards of earth to make way for the basement of the soon to be constructed Hotel Redondo. On March 28, 1889, Mr. H. L. Wyatt, a contractor in Redondo Beach was awarded the contract to build the since modified plans for the Hotel Redondo. Sources conflict, but the price tag for this massive undertaking has been quoted at approximately $250,000 or built at a cost of $1,200,000 with an additional $55,000 in fine Victorian furnishings. By September 1889, work had begun on the new hotel. More than $82,000 worth of lumber was shipped from the Willamette Steam Mills Company of, not surprisingly, Portland Oregon. The first shipload of lumber, delivered by Captain Fardelius, arrived at the wharf on June 1 of that same year, just down the bluff from the bustling construction site. The brickwork throughout the hotel was built at a cost of $6,173. In April 1890, finishing touches were being applied to the Hotel. Even though the official opening wasn‚Äôt for another month, guests had already started occupying rooms. On May 1, 1890, The Hotel Redondo opened its doors to the public. The event was much anticipated throughout the area and celebrations were scheduled to last through May 2.  Design and Architecture   Exterior  = Structure = The exterior of the hotel was punctuated with numerous Cambridge finial topped turrets, dormers, gables of varying sizes and red brick chimneys capped with classic Victorian cowls. The exterior walls were clad primarily in scalloped gingerbread wood siding with an almost castle-like brick foundation wall that stood over six feet high. Hundreds of double hung windows ensured that every room was ‚Äútouched by the Sun‚Äù at some point in the day. Windows throughout the third floor level were 15-over-1 style. The upper pane was divided into a central pane surrounded by 14 smaller framed panes. Second floor windows were simple double-hung panes with no grids. = Veranda = A veranda, supported by numerous Tuscan Style columns and paved with wooden planks meandered along the front elevation of the hotel. Offering shade for the front of the hotel, the Veranda was large enough to accommodate the Seventh Regiment Band who frequently played concerts in the afternoons of the warm summer days. The veranda also afforded guests a comfortable and commanding view of the Pacific Ocean dotted with triple masted ships waiting to dock along the busy wharfs to offload kegs of goods directly onto rail cars destined for the markets in nearby downtown Los Angeles. = Entrance = The main entrance to the Hotel Lobby was through a rather simple and comparatively small gabled Portico that was adorned with a large sunburst pattern on the front. This was surrounded on three sides by wooden steps. = Ainsworth Staircase = Access to the beach was down a grand staircase affectionately referred to today as ‚ÄúAinsworth Staircase‚Äù. This staircase stands today as one of the last remnants of the Hotel Redondo, although the majority of it remains covered over by ice plant and newer layers of concrete. = Gardens = The hotel was surrounded by acres of lushly landscaped plants and colorful flowers blanketing the gently sloping grounds. Victorian parasols could be seen meandering through the many walking paths that submerged guests in flowery bowers. The grounds on the east of the hotel offered many nooks to settle into and seating was generously placed throughout the entire grounds to encourage visitors to stop and take in the sweeping views of the surrounding landscapes. A 12-acre carnation field filled views and noses with the sweet smells of the flowers to the east of the hotel. Hotel Redondo gardner, Henry Feder, spent much time in 1893, propagating carnations throughout the grounds of the hotel. On July 11, 1908, the Hotel Redondo added to their sprawling gardens with the opening of the Spanish Gardens. A large adobe structure was the backdrop in this area and provided seating for up to seventy guests and a bustling kitchen to feed them all. Outside, more seating was available on tables that were sheltered from the sun by an enormous palm tree whose branches spanned more than thirty feet. Mixed with the salt air was the vibrant sound of stringed instruments from a Spanish orchestra that performed throughout the evenings on the weekend.  Interior  = Rooms = Each of the 225 guest rooms was fitted with all the possible conveniences of the time. This included baths with hot and cold water and fireplaces with wood mantels adorned with artistic styling. Each room was situated in such a way as to receive some sun during the day. = Banquet Hall = There was an elegant ballroom that was used for grand celebrations which happened frequently at the hotel. This is also where the final celebration of the season was held as the Hotel often closed for the winter months. One banquet in particular was noted for the extravagant decorations. It was for a local railroad magnate, T.S.C Lowe, who was being celebrated for his recently completed electric railroad erected up the Sierra Madre Mountains. The account was well documented in the Los Angeles Herald from August 31, 1893: ‚ÄúThe hall presented its usual brilliancy, the appointments being perfect. Along the center of the table were handsome bouquets of roses and other choice flowers, interspersed with potted plants. Stands of fruit were also placed along the white cloth. A graceful part of the table decorations was a number of photographs of scenes along the Mt. Lowe mountain railroad and placed at intervals.\\" \\"At the end of the hall to the rear of the head table the national colors were festooned in a continuous line from one side of the window to the other. Pairs of small silk flags were also placed to advantage about the walls of the room. Around the side columns were entwined wreaths of smilax and roses.\\" \\"The Handsomest part of the decoration was at the lower end of the room and in front of the large tier glass. Here was placed a pond of water, being rectangular in form and about 4 feet square. The water was entirely hidden by a mass of beautiful pink and white water lilies, apparently growing between the rich, dark leaves of that plant. A cluster of Egyptian lotus of various colors surmounted the flowery pool.‚Äù = Billiards Room = The arrival of summer brought with it an increase in handicap Billiard tournaments often boasting up to twenty competitors. In addition, there was a fully stocked bar for the fine Victorian gentlemen. = Bowling Alleys = Two new bowling alleys were added during renovations made in the fall of 1900. Ladies and gentlemen competitions were arranged for handicap tournaments, as well as, mixed foursomes.  Entertainment   \\"Occasions\\"  The Hotel Redondo hosted numerous community activities throughout the years. People came from all over the Los Angeles Basin, many on the Pacific Electric train cars. International guests often arrived by boats docking at the nearby wharves. Military ships would also visit Redondo Beach. Notable citizens were often celebrated with lavish banquets at the hotel. Wednesday evenings eventually were designated as the night for special entertainment occasions. The Los Angeles Herald newspaper frequently announced these occasions to entice visitors to the Hotel. Many of the events were symbolic of the idyllic culture at the turn of the century and included a noted harpist, Miss Avice Boxall, who in 1901, entertained a ‚Äúgood-sized audience‚Äù. In an edition of the Los Angeles Herald from August 1904, it noted that \\"Fresno residents, Miss Alberta C. Harkley and Miss Helen Archer, performed a high class comedy sketch called ‚ÄúThe New French Maid‚Äù much to the pleasure of Hotel Redondo guests.\\" Again, the LA Herald, In September 18, 1904, announced a ‚Äúsix-hand euchre party‚Äù hosted by Mrs. R. Post at the hotel. Another article from the LA Herald noted that during a regular Wednesday evening dinner at the hotel, \\"the dining experience was supplemented by a vaudeville performance, which included buck and wing dancing, songs and clogs and a bevy of talented performers.\\"  Fishing  Fishing was a major draw for many people in Redondo and the wharves just in front of the hotel were some of the most popular fishing spots. One of the largest Yellow tails caught in 1897 was by F. C. McKenna and weighed in at forty-nine pounds. There is also a tale from 1898 of a Hotel Redondo guest, Mr. John F. Francis, who spent a week fishing on the wharves from sun up to sundown. He hauled in more than one ton of fish and even some sharks.  Golf Course  On the grounds south of the Hotel was an 18-hole golf course where the Redondo Beach Country Club frequently hosted open handicap golf tournaments. Professional Golfer, W.C.W. Watkins was brought in by the RBCC to manage the course. The 18th hole was a celebrated experience and was nicknamed ‚ÄúHades‚Äù. Golf season opened at the beginning of summer and hosted both men's and women's competitions. Women‚Äôs tournaments were 18 holes and tee times were early in the morning. The men‚Äôs competition usually began at 2pm and they played a round of 36. Winners received either a medal or large cup for their first place award. After a competition, Golfers and patrons all gathered at the hotel for a night of dancing.  Tennis Courts  There were three asphalt tennis courts on the Hotel‚Äôs grounds and often hosted tournaments including a ‚ÄúDuffers‚Äù tournament for aspiring tennis players.  Beach Cottages  For a more private experience, the hotel offered several nearby beach cottages as an extension of the hotel. Hotel guests would frequently stroll down the Esplanade dressed in their finest Victorian outfits and took in intermittent ocean views peeking through these cottages scattered along the broad avenue. The cottages were eventually sold off by Henry Huntington when he took ownership of the hotel in 1905. One employee of Mr. Huntington‚Äôs, Olin McWain, purchased several oceanfront properties, including one of the hotel cottages, which still stands today on the Esplanade. The ‚ÄúMcWain home‚Äù has been passed down through generations and is currently owned by a fourth generation family member.  Tent City  Four prominent Redondo Beach citizens leased half the Hotel Redondo North end grounds in order to open a Tent City to house guests. The grounds were selected due to the abundance of shade trees and the proximity to the beach and pier areas. The formal opening in 1903 was a celebrated event with orchestra music and lively dancing. For between $3 - $13 a week, guests could stay in these wooden floored tents that boasted electric lights. Later in 1908, improvements were made so the tract will be in a terrace plan and the tents larger and better finished.  Proprietors/Owners/Managers  1890 - E.W. Root 1901 ‚Äì Well known Hoteliers, Dan Murphy and Charlie Duffy take ownership of the Hotel Redondo. 1903 - 1909 - H.J. Woolacott 1909 - Newton J. Skinner and W.J. Conners ‚Äì President and Vice President, respectively, of the All Night and Day Bank of Los Angeles Purchased Hotel Redondo in 1909 for a cost believed to be more than $1,000,000. Skinner served as Proprietor of the hotel through at least September 1912.  Tourism  To support an easy means of travel to the Hotel Redondo, two lines of railway were constructed and serviced by first-class train service that ran throughout the day. These new rail lines connected Redondo Beach to the wealthy residents of Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Most visitors arrived in Redondo Beach either by horse and buggy from greater Los Angeles or by steamships, which stopped at one of the three piers four times a week. Many tourists who visited after the turn of the century arrived on Henry Huntington‚Äôs newly completed Redondo Railway cars that provided service from Downtown Los Angeles, along the Beach Cities and terminating at the front of the Hotel Redondo. Notable guests to the Hotel were frequently announced in the Los Angeles Herald newspaper and celebrated with much fanfare upon their arrival. Because of prohibition and declining tourism, the Hotel Redondo closed its doors and in 1925 was sold for scrap lumber‚Äìthe price was $300.http://www.redondohistorical.org/?page_id=820  References  Hotel Redondo Hotels in Los Angeles County, California Hotel Redondo Historic hotels in the United States Hotel buildings completed in 1890 Defunct hotels in California Demolished hotels in California Hotels established in 1890 Hotels disestablished in 1926 1890 establishments in California 1926 disestablishments in California Buildings and structures demolished in 1926 ","title":"Hotel Redondo"},{"id":"47214155","text":"The Notorious Mr. Monks is a 1958 American drama film directed by Joseph Kane and starring Vera Ralston, Don Kelly and Paul Fix.Hannan p.198 The film's art direction was by Ralph Oberg.

He belonged a respected local family of Wei√üenau, descended from the ministeriales of Bolanden and related to the lords of Eppstein. His parents' names are unknown, but his grandparents were Dudo and Gisela and his brothers were Dudo and Embricho. Christian first emerges as the provost of the collegiate church of Saint Victor in Mainz, and then progressively as cantor, dean and provost of the cathedral chapter of Mainz. After the death of Archbishop Siegfried III (9 March 1249), the chapter elected Konrad von Hochstaden, already archbishop of Cologne, to be their archbishop. Pope Innocent IV and King William, however, refused to permit him to hold the two most powerful bishoprics in Germany simultaneously. Innocent suggested the chapter chose Heinrich von Leiningen, the bishop of Speyer, but he was refused. In June 1249, Christian, already advanced in age, was elected by the chapter as their second choice and was confirmed by the pope on 29 June. He was consecrated archbishop by Konrad von Hochstaden, acting as papal legate, in July or August. Christian was unenthusiastic about prosecuting the war against the Hohenstaufen, whom the pope had declared deposed in Germany in favour of William. At a conference during Easter 1251, Pope Innocent, Heinrich von Leiningen and Arnold von Isenburg, the archbishop of Trier, agreed to seek the removal of Christian on account of his hesitancy. Innocent dispatched Cardinal Hugh of Saint-Cher to Mainz to convince the archbishop to resign. Having received assurances of compensation, Christian resigned in June 1251. His downfall might have owed much to the machinations of his successor, Gerhard von Dhaun. Afterwards, he joined the Knights of Saint John and moved to Paris, where he died. He authored a short chronicle.

He previously attended the University of Alberta where he played college football as an offensive and defensive lineman and studied kinesiology.  Early career  Beard played high school football for the Falcons at Bev Facey Community High School for three years. He saw playing time at various positions, including wide receiver, tight end, and the offensive and defensive lines. Beard also played basketball at Bev Facey. From 2011 to 2014, he played college football for the Alberta Golden Bears. For his first two seasons, he played at the defensive lineman position before being moved to the offensive line by Golden Bears head coach and former Eskimos offensive lineman Chris Morris. In his senior year, Beard was named a second-team All-Canadian and played in the CIS East-West Bowl. He also caught two passes for 31 yards and a touchdown.  Professional career  Beard was selected in the second round of the 2015 CFL Draft by the Edmonton Eskimos with the 16th overall pick. In his college career, Beard had only played 16 games as an offensive lineman, and he expected to return to the Golden Bears for a third year at the position. Despite his limited experience, he remained on the active roster after the preseason. Beard made his CFL debut in the season opener on June 27, 2015 against the Toronto Argonauts. He has played in the first five games of his rookie season at left guard. In 2019, he was the unanimous selection for Edmonton Eskimos Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman.

It was originally called The Fishmongers' Arms, and was built in 1854. The pub closed in 2013, and was demolished in 2015 by a developer hoping to extend the building and build a block of flats. Wandsworth Council regarded the demolition having taken place without planning permission, and called it a \\"very serious breach\\" of council rules, and \\"unjustified\\". The council ordered developer Udhyam Amim to rebuild the pub and restore it to its appearance prior to demolition, but a year later this had not been carried out and the developer was seeking retrospective approval to demolish the building and replace it with six apartments, along with retail and commercial space. The demolition was compared to that of the Carlton Tavern in Kilburn, north London, which was demolished in April the same year. In July 2018 the building was restored. In October that year its owners applied for planning permission to make the building into a shop, office or food establishment, but planners rejected the application, ruling that the change of use would \\"result in the loss of a public house of historic and community value\\".

It occurs in the tropical and subtropical parts of all the world's oceans and is thought to be the brittle star with the most widespread distribution. It was first described by the German zoologists Johannes Peter M√ºller and Franz Hermann Troschel in 1842. The specific name honours the French zoologist Marie Jules C√©sar Savigny. Description The disc of O. savignyi is up to in diameter. The aboral (upper) surface is covered by large overlapping scales and bears a scattering of spines, especially round the edges of the disc. The (usually) six arms are long, slender and tapering, and are composed of many segments with joints between them. Each segment bears five or six thorny spines. The aboral surface of the disc is a pale greenish-brown colour and the large, triangular radial shields, close to the origins of the arms, are contrastingly darker. The oral (under) surface is cream-coloured. Distribution and habitat O. savignyi has a near cosmopolitan distribution in warm seas. It is present in the western Indo-Pacific region, the eastern Pacific Ocean, and on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The populations in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans were only united when the Panama Canal was cut across the Isthmus of Panama in 1914. This brittle star occurs from the intertidal zone down to about . It is found in all the zones of reefs, in mangrove habitats, in seagrass meadows, among seaweeds and in contaminated waters, and is often found living inside sponges, possibly as a commensal. Ecology Ophiactis savignyi is a deposit feeder and a scavenger, feeding on the detritus that accumulates on the sea bed. It raises the tips of its arms to detect food particles, rolls any nutritious items into a ball and moves them to the mouth, manipulating them by means of the tube feet. Examination of the stomach contents showed the remains of bryozoans, foraminiferans and gastropod among the large quantities of detritus and grains of sand that this brittle star had ingested. Individual O. savignyi are either male or female, and they can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Sexual reproduction involves the liberation of sperm and eggs into the sea and the development and eventual settlement of planktonic larvae. Asexual reproduction is by fragmentation, each portion being the same sex as its parent. Small, immature individuals (disc diameter under ) usually have six arms and can split themselves in two and then regenerate the missing parts of the disc and arms, often ending up with five arms. Most larger individuals have five arms and can also undergo fragmentation. The larger males do so more often than do the females, and this may account for the fact that there is an excess of males in the population.Mladenov, P.V.; Emson, R.H. (1988). Density, size structure and reproductive characteristics of fissiparous brittle stars in algae and sponges: evidence for interpopulational variation in levels of sexual and asexual reproduction. Marine ecology progress series. Oldendorf, 42(2), 181-194. After splitting, the brittle star may still be able to reproduce sexually but some fragments of the disc may have no gonads and thus be unable to spawn until regeneration is complete. In Taiwan, mature gametes occur at any time from March to December, but most of the population of O. savignyi spawn during May and June. Fission takes place at any time of year but mostly occurs between July and December. Sampling the brittle stars throughout the year resulted in finding that 48% of the individuals inspected were in the process of regeneration. The sex ratio in this locality is twenty-four males for every one female. In Hawaii, this brittle star is often to be found living in association with a sponge such as Lissodendoryx schmidti (previously Damiriana hawaiiana). Up to twenty individuals can be found clumped together in cavities in the base of the sponge, the area being so filled with the slime secreted by the sponge that the brittle stars can hardly move their arms. These brittle stars often seem to have broken or partly regenerated arms. It is not clear how they enter the sponge, nor how they feed or reproduce.

Bombay Municipal Corporation (1986 AIR 180, 1985 SCR Supl. (2) 51) was a 1985 case in the Supreme Court of India. It came before the Court as a writ petition by pavement and slum dwellers in Bombay (Now Mumbai), seeking to be allowed to stay on the pavements against their order of eviction during the monsoon months by the Bombay Municipal Corporation.  Judgement  The then Chief Justice of India, Y.V. Chandrachud delivered the unanimous judgement by the five-judge bench consisting of himself, and justices A.V. Varadarajan, O. Chinnappa Reddy, Syed Murtaza Fazl Ali, and V.D. Tulzapurkar. Some main points include: * \\"For the purposes of argument, we will assume the factual correctness of the premises that if the petitioners are evicted from their dwellings, they will be deprived of their livelihood. Upon that assumption, the question which we have to consider is whether the right to life includes the right to livelihood, We see only one answer to that question, namely, that it does. The sweep of the right to life conferred by Art. 21 is wide and far-reaching... That, which alone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life liveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life.\\" * \\"Two conclusions emerge from this discussion: one, that the right to life which is conferred by Art. 21 includes the right to livelihood and two, that it is established that if the petitioners are evicted from their dwellings, they will be deprived of their livelihood. But the Constitution does not put an absolute embargo on the deprivation of life or personal liberty. By Art. 21, such deprivation has to be according to procedure established by law\\" * \\"In order to minimise the hardship involved in any eviction, we direct that the slums, wherever situated, will not be removed until one month after the end of the current monsoon season...\\"  Enforcement of the Decision and Outcome  The pavement dwellers were evicted without resettlement. Since 1985, the principles in this case have been affirmed in many subsequent decisions, frequently leading to large-scale evictions without resettlement. For example, in the Narmada dam cases, adequate resettlement was ordered but most affected evictees have not been properly resettled and the majority of the Court declined to examine the extent to which their judgment was enforced: see Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India (2000) 10 SCC 664  Significance of the case  Reflecting on the contradictory nature of the case, Olga Tellis commented: \\"Ironically, the case helped the propertied classes; lawyers often cite the case to justify eviction of tenants and slum dwellers. But it also helps the slum dwellers; the Government can't evict them summarily. The case also spawned a lot of interest in fighting for housing as a fundamental right but if you were a pavement dweller, it is just not enough.\\"Taylor, Rupert - Third Sector Research  Pages 290-291. This case is widely quoted as exemplifying the use of civil and political rights to advance social rights but it is also criticized due to its failure to provide for the right to resettlement. It is also inconsistent with developments in other jurisdictions, where courts have found stronger rights to resettlement.https://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/ References Supreme Court of India cases 1985 in India 1985 in law ","title":"Olga Tellis and ors Vs.

He qualified as a doctor in 1952 and worked at Paddington Green Children's Hospital in both medical and surgical house positions, intending to become a paediatrician. On being called up to do National Service in 1953 he joined the Royal Air Force on a four-year short service commission, but went on to serve for 35 years until retiring in 1988. Military career From 1953 to 1965 Hurrell served as medical officer on RAF flying stations in England, Australia and Singapore; during this period he was promoted to squadron leader (1960), wing commander (1965) and learned to fly. While working in a bomber base he flew as a member of the crew to gain experience of the stresses of flying. He completed the Diploma of Aviation Medicine in 1972, and as a wing commander he served as a medical adviser to the Inspector of Air Transport. He co-ordinated the RAF's worldwide aero- medical evacuation service which every year transported more than 3,000 patients from all three services as well as their dependants.

Unlike the rest of the NHS, pharmacies are largely privately provided apart from those in hospitals, and even these are now often privately run. History Commerce of drugs in United Kingdom was initially regulated by the Guild of Peppers since 1180, they were in charge of the assurance of the items that were. In 1345 some members of the Guilt of Peppers founded Worshipful Company of Grocers that operated until 1617, that was in charge of assurance of the quality of food and drugs, their role related drugs business was replaced by Worshipful Society of Apothecaries (one of the 110 Livery companies) that operated since 1617 and its members were in charge of train as apprentice for 7 years the future new members until they became free man and get the \\"freedom\\" of being apothecary's apprentices. Silvanus Bevan received 7 years of training and later he cofounded Allen & Hanburys in 1715 (that developed salbutamol in 1966 and now is part of GlaxoSmithKline). The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded in 1841. The Pharmacy Act 1868 limited the sale of poisons and dangerous drugs to qualified pharmacists and druggists. The advent of the NHS had an immediate beneficial effect on the pharmaceutical industry. In 1960 there were proposals that the private patients of general practitioners should be enabled to receive their drugs free on the health service, but they were not implemented. The supply of drugs in the hospital service represented about one-tenth by value of the supply through the retail pharmaceutical service in 1965. The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was replaced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the General Pharmaceutical Council in September 2010. There was a reduction of more than a quarter in the number of pharmacies in the community between 1963 and 1979. According to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee at that time over 4,000 pharmacies in England and Wales dispensing less than 24,000 prescriptions per annum were losing money on NHS services. As measured in defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day the UK had a moderate rate of consumption of antibiotics in 2015 with a rate of 20.5, double that of the Netherlands, but half that of Turkey. The Health Survey for England 2016 showed that 48% of adults in the country had taken at least one prescribed medicine in the past week, and 24% had taken three or more. 10% were using antidepressants. A total of 1.1 billion prescriptions were dispensed in England in 2016 - 47% more than 2006. Contract NHS pharmacies are governed and paid for their NHS work under a standard contract, which was modified in 2005. This modification enabled pharmacy contractors to be paid for Medicines Use Reviews conducted by pharmacists for people with multiple long term prescriptions. There are also New Medicine Services, which are intended for patients who have started on long term medication, such as asthma treatment. In 2016 the government announced that the budget for pharmacy would be reduced by ¬£170 million nationally from 2017 (¬£113 million in England) - its ‚Äúshare‚Äù of the ¬£22 billion in savings required across the NHS. Under the new contract there will be a payment of ¬£1.33 per prescribed item dispensed, but the flat rate establishment payment (around ¬£25,000 per pharmacy) set up in 2005 will be reduced by 40% and is to be abolished. There will be a Pharmacy Access Scheme with monthly payments for the 1427 pharmacies more than a mile away from the next pharmacy. There will be additional quality incentives for: * Using NHS mail * Producing an annual written patient safety report * Training staff in safeguarding vulnerable people * Using the Summary Care Record * Achieving Healthy Living Pharmacy Level 1 * Asthma referrals * Dementia Friends trained teams In October 2017 the first payments to community pharmacies under the new quality payments scheme were made by NHS England. 90% of community pharmacies, 11,094 applied. 10,985 passed the qualifying criteria and received a payment. Future payments under the scheme are conditional on all pharmacy staff being able to send and receive email by the November review date. Pharmacists who have accessed Summary Care Records more than 100 times between two specific dates will also be eligible for a payment. Wales The NHS in Wales has a separate pharmacy contract. In April 2017 Vaughan Gething announced that there were \\"no proposals to reduce investment in community pharmacy here in Wales\\" as was happening in England. By 2020 Welsh pharmacists will have access to patients‚Äô summary care records in order to help deliver the Welsh common ailment service. By March 2018 all the Welsh pharmacies with access to the Choose Pharmacy IT system will be able to access the Welsh GP record. Scotland The Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Scotland called for the creation of a single electronic patient health record which pharmacists could access in October 2017. They said their members needed to have the same access to records as a GP or hospital consultant in order to provide safe treatment to people in the community. Pharmacy First was launched in 2017. This scheme permits pharmacists to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and impetigo in children without a doctor's prescription. It also increases access for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to medication- related advice and patient-centred medicine review. Northern Ireland Antibiotic use is the highest in the UK, with prescribing rates in October 2017 being 30% higher than in England. Dispensing doctors In rural areas GPs are permitted to dispense medication if there is not a pharmacy within a mile of the surgery. There are 1,290 dispensing practices across the UK serving 8.8 million patients in 2015. Many are members of the Dispensing Doctors' Association. England NHS England is supporting initiatives to place pharmacists in GP practices in order to improve the management of medication for patients with long term conditions. About 420 million repeat prescriptions are generated in the UK each year ‚Äî about 200 for each general practitioner each week. In the practice pharmacists can do more medicine use reviews. By April 2017 there were plans for 1350 practices in England to have access to clinical pharmacists. It is intended to have 1,500 pharmacists in general practice by 2020. NHS England‚Äôs announced funding for 180 pharmacists and 60 technicians to work in care homes in March 2018. The cost of medicines in primary care in England in 2017/2018 was ¬£8.87 billion, slightly less than the previous year. The community pharmacy consultation service started from 29 October 2019. Patients can be referred to community pharmacies from NHS 111 for minor ailments, such as earache, nasal congestion and sore throat. They are reimbursed at ¬£14 per consultation. Costs In 2018/2019 medicines prescribed in hospitals and in primary care cost ¬£18.9 billion, 4% more than in the previous year. 54% of the cost was attributed to hospital prescribing. These sums are based on list prices, not necessarily the prices paid. Hospital dispensing Because of greater use of specialist medicines the cost, at list price, of prescribed medication in hospitals in England increased by 10.8% to ¬£9.2 billion in 2017/2018 compared with the previous year. In 2010/2011 the hospital pharmacy bill was ¬£4.2 billion. The biggest single cost was adalimumab at ¬£494.5 million, the patent on which expired in December 2018. The actual costs paid may be less than the list prices. Specialist Pharmacy Service The Specialist Pharmacy Service provides advice primarily on high-cost, complex and innovative medicines and medicines- related services to NHS trusts and commissioners in England. It is responsible for medicines optimisation. It employs about 100 whole time equivalent senior pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and support staff. It provides advice about shortages of medication. Regulation The services provided under contract to the NHS in community pharmacies and by community pharmacists are regulated in part by the NHS, under the provisions of the Pharmacy Act 1954 and The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations, which prevent new pharmacies being opened without permission. This was done by the family health services authorities and then by primary care trusts. Now regulation is by NHS England and its Pharmaceutical Services Regulations committees. Retail and retail-based hospital pharmacies in England, Scotland and Wales are theoretically regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), whilst those in Northern Ireland are regulated by the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (PSNI). However, in 2018 it was revealed through a Freedom of Information request that whilst the General Pharmaceutical Council had issued 4,111 sanctions against individual registrants (pharmacists and pharmacy technicians), it had never issued any sanctions against pharmacy owners for a breach of its premises standards, since its inception in 2010. Regulation may be defined as the imposition of rules, backed by the use of penalties. Since penalties/sanctions/consequences are a key component of regulation, and the GPhC hasn't issued any, it could therefore be argued that the GPhC does not regulate pharmacy premises. Non-retail hospital pharmacies are regulated as part of the hospital premises regulation by the Care Quality Commission. Local pharmaceutical committees Local pharmaceutical committees were established in every area in 1948. Each is a representative committee of persons providing pharmaceutical services as defined in Section 44 of the National Health Service Act 1977. Each committee has about 12 members. There are now about 80 in England. Retail pharmacies 89% of the UK population live within a 20-minute walk of their local pharmacy. A majority of the population visit a pharmacy at least once every 28 days. In 2014 more than 1.1 billion prescription items were dispensed in England. This was 34.5 million more than in the previous 12 months and 378.4 million more than in 2004. The total net ingredient cost of prescribed items was ¬£8.9 billion. 89.9% of all items dispensed in England were free of charge. In Scotland the total number of items dispensed in the community in 2014‚Äì2015 was 101.1 million with a net cost of ¬£1.2bn. Since at least 1979 there have been proposals that pharmacists should develop their role of giving advice to the public. NHS England announced a pilot scheme in July 2015 for GP practices in England to employ around 300 pharmacists to provide clinical care and relieve pressure on GPs. They will monitor patients with long-term conditions, create medicine plans and provide advice and expertise on day-to-day medicines issues. In London pharmacies are used to deliver the Flu vaccination. In 2013/4 108,700 vaccinations were delivered by 1,089 pharmacies in the capital. Medicines Use Reviews in patients homes are delivered by pharmacists in Croydon. In August 2015 it was announced that retail pharmacies would be given access to NHS patients Summary Care Records after a pilot of 140 pharmacies in Somerset, Northampton, North Derbyshire, Sheffield and West Yorkshire, demonstrated ‚Äúsignificant benefits.‚Äù Pharmacists have to ask for a patient‚Äôs permission to view their record.

Playing career Amateur career Campbell played Jordanhill as a prop. Provincial career He represented the Glasgow District side. International career Campbell was capped at Scotland B level. Coaching career Campbell coached the Glasgow District side when they were still an amateur district. Campbell was previously the Head Coach of Scotland A and the scrummage and line out coach with the senior Scotland side. He took over the professional district side Glasgow Warriors, then Glasgow Rugby, from New Zealander Kiwi Searancke in April 2003 (although previous coach Richie Dixon did stand in for a few weeks as caretaker between Searancke leaving and Campbell arriving). As part of the coaching set-up Sean Lineen joined him as assistant coach and Shade Munro became a development coach. Campbell initially got the Glasgow side back to playing rugby the players enjoyed. Glasgow started the 2003-04 season with a confident win over Cardiff Blues. They were however very inconsistent and Glasgow finished 2nd bottom of the table sandwiched by Edinburgh above and the Border Reivers below. The 2004-05 season saw Glasgow in 7th place in the table and was the best showing from a Scottish side that season. However that season's mid table push was the best in Campbell's reign in charge. The Glasgow Rugby side finally rebranded itself as Glasgow Warriors in 2005. The 2004-05 impetus gradually disappeared from the Warriors the following season and they managed just 4 wins in the Celtic League in 2005-06. Attendances dropped with the erratic performances and the number of players selected for Scotland international duty also fell. Finally the chief executive of the SRU Gordon McKie stepped in to resolve the situation. Campbell was replaced as Warriors boss by his assistant Sean Lineen on 28 March 2006. With the season almost over Lineen could do little to stop the Warriors finishing bottom of the Magners League.

It is also not far from the source of the River Elz and thus the main European watershed between the Rhine and the Danube. The West Way, a major hiking trail in the Black Forest runs past the chapel as does the long-distance ski trail from Schonach to Belchen.  Original chapel  St. Martin‚Äôs Chapel stands above an old mountain pass that may have even existed in the La T√®ne period (5th‚Äì1st centuries B.C.). If that was the case, the chapel represents a link between Celtic and early Christian culture in this region. Archaeological excavations in 1958 showed that, on the site of the present chapel, there was a religious building as early as the time around 800 A.D. perhaps a heathen spring shrine. The same investigations uncovered a basin that, if this was in fact a religious building, could have been a font. From the exposed foundations, the appearance of this first building was able to be reconstructed. It consisted of a sacred space, 4.20 by 4.20 metres in area, and an attached baptismal room with two windows. According to the report of the 1958 restoration, this layout is similar to that of St. Wendelin‚Äôs Chapel (600 A.D.) in Cazis in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden. In historical documents, the elevation of a forest chapel to the status of a church by the abbey of St. Margaret is recorded in 915, but it is not clear if that refers to this earliest building. It could also refer to a chapel, recorded in a papal bull of 1178 by Pope Alexander III, that was erected on a high mountain by the municipality of Furtwangen.  Medieval chapel  In the Middle Ages a new chapel was built using the old foundations and possibly parts of the outer walls. This probably dates to the Late Gothic period. After the chapel had been partially destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, a new roof and a new ceiling were built. The centre part of this has survived and bears the date 1672. In the chapel there are other dates, some of which, thanks to the restoration work (Haas 1997) have been able to be correctly attributed: the retable dates to the year 1705, and the date of 1905 above the door lintel indicates the restoration measures of that time. The date of 1460 that was painted on the retable until the 1995-97 restoration was classified as incorrect.  Temporary use of the chapel  Since the beginning of the 19th century, the chapel has been owned by the Kolmen farm. However, in 1848 it was converted into a utility building: extensions and alterations were made so that it had a stable, hayloft, shed, toilet and cellar. Even the tower was replaced by a chimney. The appearance of the present chapel dates back to an account that, in 1900, the Kolmenhof farmer made a vow that he would honour God and reinstate the former chapel as a place of worship if God would free him and his family from economic hardship. He appears to have been heard because, in 1905-06, the chapel was largely returned to its original state, a turret being replaced in its original position. In 1906 the chapel was rededicated.  Restoration measures and archaeological excavations  The Longinus cross inside the chapel In 1958, the first comprehensive restoration measures, together with archaeological investigations, took place (under Schmidt). The remains of the utility building were moved, including the cement plaster and debris in the basement. The altarpiece was redesigned to a Baroque style, after it had been painted over in 1920 with oils. To do this marbling and gilding were used. Another comprehensive restoration of the building (under B√ºrk) and plasterwork investigations (under Jung) took place 1995-1997. This saw inter alia the roof covered with hand-split spruce shingles, ventilation and alarm facilities installed, the walls replastered and the pews restored. The interior of the chapel (altarpiece, retable, Gothic sculptures, processional, etc.) has been restored in keeping with its previous appearance. The outdoor area with its exposed foundations and boulders, as it is today, dates from this period.

She was built at the shipyard in Revelstoke, British Columbia to replace Dispatch, which had never been successful because her service was hindered during low water and when the water froze in winter. Illecillewaet was designed to \\"float on dew\\" with her shallow draft to enable operation during those times. Design Illecillewaet was not attractive, with a wooden hull similar that of a flat- bottomed barge and a blunt bow to break ice in the winter. However, she was useful as a freight carrier, especially during low water and when a small boat was preferable to a larger steamer with higher operating costs and a larger crew.

In the late 1890s, she hauled rail and construction materials with SS Trail for the extension of the Columbia and Western Railway to the Boundary district. In 1897, Illecillewaet and SS Lytton provided a new barge service from Robson, British Columbia to West Robson to haul coal from the Crowsnest mines to Trail, British Columbia.

The station is owned by El Heraldo de M√©xico newspaper as Heraldo Radio, a news/talk station. History XEAV-FM 100.3 received its concession on November 25, 1963, but it had been operating since at least February 1958, making it the first FM radio station in Jalisco. It was an FM simulcast of XEAV-AM 580 \\"Radio Guadalajara\\". Between 1970 and 1976, XEAV-FM became XHAV-FM, a separately programmed station. The 1980s saw the station turn its focus to a younger audience with rock music; known as \\"Super Stereo\\", the station was considered a launching pad for radio personalities in Guadalajara. In 2004, XHAV was sold by N√∫cleo Radio Guadalajara to Grupo Imagen, and two years later, Super Stereo, which had seen its ratings wane over time, was relaunched as a new radio format from Imagen, known as RMX. RMX was designed to appeal to a young audience (18-30). Meanwhile, it proved enough of a success in Guadalajara that Imagen expanded the format to other cities: Quer√©taro, Celaya, Nuevo Laredo and Canc√∫n all received RMX stations between 2007 and 2011. The national RMX system was unusually decentralized, and each RMX station originated programming for the network. In 2017, RMX went full-time on XHDL-FM Mexico City. In 2010, RMX began the 212 annual concert in Guadalajara, now among western Mexico's largest musical events. Sale to El Heraldo de M√©xico On June 16, 2019, Grupo Imagen and Grupo Andrade, owners of the El Heraldo de M√©xico newspaper, announced that they had reached a strategic agreement under which Imagen would sell XHDL-FM and XHAV-FM to the newspaper, subject to the approval of the IFT. RMX closed down at 11:59pm on Friday, June 21, to allow El Heraldo to begin operation of the station as Heraldo Radio on June 22. The station remains a full-time simulcast of XHDL-FM.

Academic John Shelton Reed argues that \\"Southerners' differences from the American mainstream have been similar in kind, if not degree, to those of the immigrant ethnic groups\\". Reed states that Southerners, as other ethnic groups, are marked by differences from the national norm, noting that they tend to be poorer, less well educated and more rural, as well as being \\"occupationally specialized\\". He argues that they differ in cultural and political terms, and that their accents serve as an ethnic marker. According to The New York Times, a survey of ethnic images conducted by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center in 1990 \\"found that Americans view Southerners almost like a separate ethnic group, and regard them as 'a little less intelligent, a little less hard-working' than whites in general\\". Southern writers in the lead up to the American Civil War built on the idea of a Southern nation by claiming that secession was not based on slavery but rather on \\"two separate nations\\". These writers postulated that Southerners were descended from Norman Cavaliers, Huguenots, Jacobites and other supposed \\"Mediterranean races\\" linked to the Romans, while Northerners were claimed to be descended from Anglo-Saxon serfs and other Germanic immigrants who had supposed \\"hereditary hatred\\" against the Southerners. Sociologist William L. Smith argues that \\"regional identity and ethnic identity are often intertwined in a variety of interesting ways such that some scholars have viewed white southerners as an ethnic group\\". In her book Southern Women, Caroline Matheny Dillman also documents a number of authors who posit that Southerners might constitute an ethnic group. She notes that the historian George Brown Tindall analyzed the persistence of the distinctiveness of Southern culture in The Ethnic Southerners (1976), \\"and referred to the South as a subculture, pointing out its ethnic and regional identity\\". The 1977 book The Ethnic Imperative, by Howard F. Stein and Robert F. Hill, \\"viewed Southerners as a special kind of white ethnicity\\". Dillman notes that these authors, and earlier work by John Shelton Reed, all refer to the earlier work of Lewis Killian, whose White Southerners, first published in 1970, introduced \\"the idea that Southerners can be viewed as an American ethnic group\\". Killian does, however, note that: \\"Whatever claims to ethnicity or minority status ardent 'Southernists' may have advanced, white southerners are not counted as such in official enumerations\\". Precursors to Killian include sociologist Erdman Beynon, who in 1938 made the observation that \\"there appears to be an emergent group consciousness among the southern white laborers\\", and economist Stuart Jamieson, who argued four years later that Oklahomans, Arkansans and Texans who were living in the valleys of California were starting to take on the \\"appearance of a distinct 'ethnic group'\\". Beynon saw this group consciousness as deriving partly from the tendency of northerners to consider them as a homogeneous group, and Jamieson saw it as a response to the label \\"Okie\\". More recently, historian Clyde N. Wilson has argued that \\"In the North and West [white Southerners] were treated as and understood themselves to be a distinct ethnic group, referred to negatively as 'hillbillies' and 'Okies'\\". The Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, published in 1980, includes a chapter on Southerners authored by Reed, alongside chapters by other contributors on Appalachians and Yankees. Writing in the journal Ethnic and Racial Studies, social anthropologist M. G. Smith argued that the entries do not satisfactorily indicate how these groups meet the criteria of ethnicity, and so justify inclusion in the encyclopedia. Historian David L. Carlton, who argues that Killian, Reed and Tindall's \\"ethnic approach does provide a way to understand the South as part of a vast, patchwork America, the components of which have been loath to allow their particularities to be eaten away by the corrosions of a liberal-capitalist order\\", nonetheless notes problems with the approach. He argues that the South is home to two ethnic communities (white and black) as well as smaller, growing ethnic groups, not just one. He argues that: \\"Most important, though, and most troubling, is the peculiar relationship of white southerners to the nation's history\\". The view of the average white Southerner, Carlton argues, is that they are quintessential Americans, and their nationalism equates \\"America\\" with the South.

It featured a considerably altered lineup and a departure from the sound on the group's past psychedelic pop works, toward blues rock. The album itself failed to chart, but a single, \\"Good Morning Starshine\\", peaked in the lower reaches of the Billboard Hot 100. Background Lineup changes within Strawberry Alarm Clock began with drummer Randy Seol and bassist George Bunnell, who were both aboard for the group's first three albums, but departed after the release of their third album, The World in a Sea Shell, near the end of 1968. However, ex-manager Bill Holmes, who was fired for incompetency, offered the two former members, along with three other musicians, a deal to form another Strawberry Alarm Clock and tour under that moniker. After multiple legal disputes, in which Holmes eventually withdrew his version of the band, promoters were confused over which incarnation of the group was authentic, and refused to book either one. In the meantime, the band found replacements in singer/guitarist Jimmy Pitman and drummer Marty Katin. Pitman assumed duties as lead guitarist and Ed King moved over to bass guitar, which he had already played on some material on Strawberry Alarm Clock's second and third albums. Katin was unable to gel with the group and, without recording with the band, was replaced by Gene Gunnels, who had appeared on the number one hit \\"Incense and Peppermints\\". Good Morning Starshine was the first album produced by the band members. According to keyboardist Mark Weitz, \\"It was the first time Ed and I produced an album without any help. I say Ed and I because we were interested in doing it, and worked well together, right down to the mixdowns. It was the first time either of us had the chance of really controlling the sound from beginning to end\\". With Pitman at the helm as one of the prime songwriters, the band began to branch out from their closely associated brand of psychedelic pop to a hard-edged take on blues rock. Pitman's twangy instrumentals and soulful vocals were, in part, a reason for their direction change. More importantly, the band had been lacking a hit single and had hopes that expressing their versatility would appeal to their fan base. Strawberry Alarm Clock did not totally depart from the sound featured on their past albums, as evident with the tracks \\"Small Package\\", \\"(You Put Me On) Stand By\\", and \\"Dear Joy\\". Upon release, Good Morning Starshine failed to chart, though their title single managed to peak at number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100, but was severely out-charted by Oliver's version, which had reached number three. It was the only track not produced by the group, originating from the counterculture musical, Hair. As Weitz explains, \\"[UNI's] attitude at the time was, 'Let's give them one more chance to squeeze out a hit. If they fail, then it's over.' I think it was a miscalculation on 'Good Morning Starshine.' We played well on the music track, we all personally disliked the song as not being our style ‚Äì that's an understatement ‚Äì [but] recorded it anyway. Oliver's version came out before ours, and we were killed! That was the end of the line\\". Strawberry Alarm Clock released several additional non-album singles throughout 1969 and 1970, and appeared in the film, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, but could never match their past popularity and disbanded from 1971 through 1974.

M.A. Goodall, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 12 July 2015. Goldicutt began to study at the Royal Academy in 1812. He became a member of the Architectural Students' Society, and a skilled draughtsman and colourist, winning the Royal Academy silver medal in 1814 with drawings of the Mansion House. In 1815 he won the silver medal of the Society of Arts. In the same year he travelled to Paris where he studied at the school of Achille Lecl√®re and entered the monthly competition of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. He then travelled in Italy and Sicily for several years preparing drawings that were later published. Following his return to Britain he exhibited a drawing of the transverse section of St Peter's, Rome, for which he later received a gold medal from the Pope.  Career  Goldicutt worked with Henry Hakewill until Hakewill's death in 1830, as well as working on his own projects. He submitted drawings for the design of the new Post Office building (1820), the Cambridge University observatory (1821), the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum (1829), the Fishmongers' Hall (1830) and for Nelson monument (1841). John Henry Hakewill (1811‚Äì1880) was later Goldicutt's pupil. Goldicutt showed 35 architectural drawings at the Royal Academy between 1810 and 1842. In 1820, his drawing Ruins of the Great Hypaethral Temple, Salinuntum, Sicily, was etched by Bartolomeo Pinelli and appeared in Goldicutt's The Antiquities of Sicily (1819). One of Goldicutt's last designs was for St James' Church, Sussex Gardens, Paddington, (c. 1841) which was finished by George Gutch after Goldicutt's death. Goldicutt's original scheme was for a neo-classical design in yellow brick, influenced by his travels in Italy. The yellow brick was used but Gutch changed the style to Gothic. The building was later extensively changed by G.E. Street in 1882.\\"St James.

It was written by Fred Rose and takes aim at Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Background Country music has a long tradition of upholding conservative values and patriotism, and by the 1950s, with the Cold War heating up, several country singers had already recorded pro-American, anti-Communist songs. Roy Acuff, arguably Williams' biggest musical influence, recorded \\"Advice to Joe\\" while Elton Britt had recorded \\"The Red We Want Is the Red We've Got in the Old Red, White and Blue.\\" Producer Fred Rose composed the novelty \\"No, No, Joe,\\" which, despite Hank's wry delivery, made its point.

Education and career  Before moving to NYU in 2008, Scheffler taught for 31 years at the University of California, Berkeley. Scheffler received his PhD from Princeton University, where he was a student of the distinguished philosopher Thomas Nagel. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2004. He is the son of the Harvard philosopher Israel Scheffler.  Philosophical work  His most recent book, Death and the Afterlife, based on his Tanner Lectures at University of California, Berkeley has generated considerable attention for its argument that much that we value in life depends on the assumption that life will continue long after our death. As the Princeton philosopher Mark Johnston explained in the Boston Review: \\"In Scheffler‚Äôs self-consciously idiosyncratic use of the term, the 'afterlife' is neither a supernatural continuation of this life, nor the result of a deeper naturalistic understanding of the kind of thing we are; it is what John Stuart Mill called 'the onward rush of mankind,' the collective life of humanity after our individual deaths. Scheffler‚Äôs thesis is that the onward rush of humankind‚Äîthe collective afterlife‚Äîis much more important to us than we are ordinarily apt to notice.\\" Assessing the argument, the English philosopher John Cottingham wrote: \\"Scheffler has produced a superb essay -- indeed it seems to me about as good as analytic philosophy gets.

She was particularly active with the Metropolitan Opera and the Seattle Opera, and is best remembered for her annual performances in Seattle of Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle from 1974-1987. She taught on the voice faculty of Pepperdine University. Early life and education Born Geraldine Helen Rice in the Bronx, Decker moved with her family to California in her youth. She attended Corvallis High School in Studio City, California from 1945 to 1949. She soon after married her husband of 55 years, Howard Decker, with whom she had two sons, Wayne and Dirk Decker. While raising her children she pursued studies in voice with Dr. Nandor Domokos in Los Angeles. She later studied with Luisa Franceschi and her husband, baritone Ellae Verna, in New York City. Later life and career After her sons were grown and had moved out of the family home, Decker began pursuing a career in opera at the age of 40. She devoted the next two decades of her life to her opera career. She first drew critical notice in 1974 at the Seattle Opera where she appeared in Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle as Erda in both Das Rheingold and Siegfried, Schwertleite in Die Walk√ºre, and the First Norn G√∂tterd√§mmerung. She portrayed those roles again in Seattle every summer through 1987. She portrayed many other roles at the Seattle Opera during her career, including Albine in Massenet's Tha√Øs, Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore, Filippyevna in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, Grandmother Burja in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa, Herodias in Strauss' Salome, Klyt√§mnestra in Strauss' Elektra, Mama McCourt in Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe, Marthe Schwerlein in Gounod's Faust, Mistress Quickly in Verdi's Falstaff, Mother Jeanne in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites, and the Nurse/Innkeeper in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. Decker made her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1978 as Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. On December 17, 1980 she sang the same role for her debut at the Metropolitan Opera with Grace Bumbry as Santuzza and David Stivender conducting. She was a regular presence on the Met stage for six seasons, portraying such roles as Gertrud in Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, Gertrude in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette (with Placido Domingo conducting), Grandmother Burja in Jen≈Øfa, and Schwertleite in Die Walk√ºre among others. In 1981 she portrayed the Large Woman in the Met premiere of Les Mamelles de Tir√©sias, and was also seen that year as Annina in the premiere of the Colin Graham staging of Verdi's La traviata; a production which was broadcast nationally on Live from the Met. Her last performance at the Met was as the Nurse in Boris Godunov on March 23, 1987 with Paul Plishka in the title role and James Conlon conducting. In 1982 Decker created the role of Nelly Dean in the world premiere of Bernard Herrmann's Wuthering Heights at the Portland Opera. That same year she appeared in a minor singing part in Franco Zeffirelli's film version of La Traviata. Other companies she performed roles with during her career included Cabrillo Music Theatre, Hawaii Opera Theater, the Long Beach Opera, the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, and Opera San Jos√©. In 1990 she portrayed Mrs. Beemer in the Disney film Polly: Comin' Home! . She also appeared as a maid in the 1976 film Harry and Walter Go to New York.

The Aresaces were Belgic tribe. They were closely related to, and probably originally part of, the Treveri. They inhabited the left bank of the Rhine in the Mainz-Bingen area, which was once the easternmost part of Treveran territory.  Written sources  The Aresaces are not mentioned by ancient writers, such as geographers or Julius Caesar, but are known from three inscriptions dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.Klein-Winternheim, mid-1st century CE, (scan): [Marti Lo]ucetio L(ucius) Iulius B[‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì] / [‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì et Tert]ulla(?) fontem et it[er per] / [possessi]onem suam ad tem[plum] / [‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì]ARESACE[‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì] publice P[‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì]; Mainz- Weisenau, (scan): [‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì] Romanis [qui cum?

Two of these come from Rhenish Hesse, while the third is from Augusta Treverorum (Trier), the capital of the Treveri. A grave monument from Mainz-Weisenau that identifies the two deceased children as Treveri = : Respectus / nat(ione) Tre(vir) an/nor(um) VIII / Veranius / nat(ione) Trev(ir) / anno(rum) IIIIII / Samocna / nat(ione) Tre(vir) an/nor(um) II filia / Pr(a)esens / pater fili(i)s / suis posuit / ob pieta(tem) / h(ic) s(iti) sunt. has been explained as evidence that the Aresaces continued to regard themselves as a subdivision of the Treveri.Thus Another Celtic tribe in Rhenish Hesse, known from an inscription as well as ancient literature, was the Cairacates.; see  Settlement area of the Aresaces  Remains of Celtic earthworks at the oppidum on the Donnersberg, a possible early centre of the Aresaces According to current scholarship, the Aresaces would have been organized as a pagus or sub- unit of the Treveri, settled in Rhenish Hesse in the area south and east of Mainz. Their neighbours to the south were the Celtic Mediomatrici, while on the opposite bank of Rhine dwelled the Germanic Vangiones, Triboci, Nemetes, and the Mattiaci (a subdivision of the Chatti) in the area around present-day Wiesbaden. This area was only sparsely settled during the late La T√®ne period, with larger settlements barely to be found in the second half of the 1st century BCE. One possible cultural and administrative centre of the Aresaces might have been the oppidum on the Donnersberg, which would have marked the southeasternmost centre of Treveran influence. Urbanization was only to increase noticeably at the time of, or shortly before, the Roman presence in the region.  The Aresaces in the Mainz area  At the time of the Romans' arrival in greater Mainz in 13‚Äì12 BCE, there were two or more lesser civilian settlements there that can probably be attributed to the Aresaces. One such at Mainz-Weisenau emerged either shortly before or at the same time as the Roman army camp at Mainz, while a village-like settlement at Mainz-Bretzenheim also straddled the banks of the Zaybach. There is further evidence for settlement at Mainz-Finthen near the K√∂nigborn and Aubach. A Celtic and later Roman temple district between Klein-Winternheim and Ober-Olm near Mainz was dedicated to Mars Loucetius and Nemetona; this is regarded as the tribal sanctuary of the Aresaces living in the area.  The Aresaces under Roman rule  Remains of a Roman aqueduct at Mainz Under Domitian, if not before, the Romans administratively separated the area of Treveran territory on the left bank of the Rhine from the civitas Treverorum and the province of Gallia Belgica, attaching the Rhenish Hesse region to the newly organized province of Germania Superior. The Aresaces were likely to have been organized as a separate civitas from the Treveri at this stage, if not earlier, as were their neighbours the Cairacates. Meanwhile, the city of Mainz‚Äîknown in Latin as Mogontiacum‚Äîflourished as a legionary headquarters for a number of Roman legionsThese included, at various times, the Legio XIIII Gemina, Legio XVI Gallica, Legio XXII Primigenia, Legio IIII Macedonica, Legio I Adiutrix, and Legio XXI Rapax. and also the capital of the province of Germania Superior.  Aresaces and Vangiones in Rhenish Hesse  The territory of the Aresaces was formerly thought to have belonged to the Vangiones, who would thus have occupied quite a large tract on the left bank of the Rhine. However, this interpretation is now considered superseded in light of archaeological discoveries. The Vangiones' settlement on the left bank of the Rhine, in the area of present-day Worms (ancient Civitas Vangionum or Borbetomagus), is now considered to have taken place only under the aegis of the Roman administration during the Augustan period.See, among others, Marion Witteyer, p. 1025.

The review was undertaken to consider workforce issues, such as the balance between specialisation and generalism in medicine. The review was supported by a range of organisations concerned with medical education and had an independent chair, Professor Sir David Greenaway. Background In 2005, Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) had launched, introducing a new style of specialist training across the UK. The independent inquiry into these changes led by John Tooke in 2007 had commented on some of the issues. In 2011, Medical Education England (MEE) scoped themes that could be considered as part of further restructuring of medical training. The relative lack of generalist training had been highlighted by another advisory group, the NHS Future Forum, who pointed towards the review that would follow. The review The Independent Review of the Shape of Medical Training was launched in March 2012 with economist David Greenaway, Vice-Chancellor of The University of Nottingham, appointed as the chair. The review was jointly sponsored by Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC), The Conference of Postgraduate Medical Deans of the UK (COPMeD), the General Medical Council (GMC), Health Education England (HEE), the Medical Schools Council (MSC), NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Greenaway met with representatives of these organisations on 22 March 2012 and the terms of reference were agreed. Twelve people were selected to be part of an advisory group, which had the opportunity to consider written and oral submissions from stakeholders, research evidence, site visits, feedback from focus groups and other events. The GMC provided the secretariat. The initial intention was for the review to report by June 2013. A report was published in October 2013. The report The report suggests an argument for changing the structure of training is that there are more patients with a complex mixture of conditions. This means doctors need to have a greater breadth of knowledge, rather than specialising early in their careers, it says. Proposals The final report of the review listed 19 recommendations. There were a number of suggestions for the UK governments, including that : * on leaving medical school, doctors should be allowed to be fully registered to practise, rather than completing a year working under supervision as they do now. * on completion of their postgraduate training doctors should be awarded a certificate of specialty training, rather than the certificate of completion of training (CCT) * the length of training for a qualified doctor to become a consultant could be reduced to between six and eight years * specialties be grouped together under ‚Äúpatient care themes‚Äù with common clinical objectives Responses Peter Rubin, the chair of the GMC, acknowledged that moving the point of full registration would need further discussion. He also said that there would need to be \\"some stability in a system that has already been subject to a great deal of change and pressure in recent years.\\" There were questions raised about transparency and political independence of the review, after details emerged of meetings between the GMC and civil servants from the Department of Health which were not mentioned in the final report.

He served as lieutenant treasurer during the administration of governor Pedro Men√©ndez de M√°rquez (1577-1594).  Career  In 1586, during the governorship of Pedro Men√©ndez M√°rquez, the English privateer Francis Drake attacked and burned St. Augustine (San Agust√≠n), the capital of Florida (La Florida), destroying many documents including records of account, so that Arg√ºelles had to make a new inventory of property that remained after the fire. When Governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Avenda√±o died in 1595, the three treasury officials, treasurer Juan Men√©ndez M√°rquez, accountant Bartolom√© de Arg√ºelles and factor-overseer Alonso de las Alas, became acting co-governors of La Florida.On the death, unauthorized absence, retirement or removal of a governor, the treasury officials often jointly governed Florida until a new governor appointed by the king could take up his duties. Such joint interim governorships occurred in 1595-1597, 1612-1613, 1631-1633, and 1646-1648.() At the time of Avenda√±o's death, Arg√ºelles was in Mexico City to retrieve the situado, the annual subsidy from the treasury of New Spain to support the presidio at St. Augustine. Men√©ndez M√°rquez and Las Alas were reported to have quarrelled over the governance of Florida until Arg√ºelles returned from Mexico City.Francis & Kole: 116 Arg√ºelles, who had been in Florida since the 1570s and had become accountant in 1591, aspired to be governor.Arg√ºelles served as lieutenant of the Santa Elena garrison from 1583 to 1587. He returned to Spain in time to serve as a captain of infantry with the Spanish Armada. The ship he claimed to have served on, however, wrecked in Ireland with only one known survivor, who was executed by the English. Arg√ºelles soon returned to Florida, and was appointed accountant.(Francis & Kole: 115) Arg√ºelles sent a petition to be appointed as governor to the King shortly after Avenda√±o's death. The King turned down Arg√ºelles's request, and appointed Gonzalo M√©ndez de Cancio y Donleb√∫n, who had never been to Florida, as governor. M√©ndez arrived at St. Augustine in 1597.Bushnell 1981: 145-146Bushnell 1991: 118, 120, 122Francis & Kole: 17-18 Soon after M√©ndez reached St. Augustine, he encountered resistance over a payment from the royal treasury to the new garrison priest, Father Ricardo. Arg√ºelles and factor-overseer Las Alas refused to make the payment, saying that there was no authorization for it. Men√©ndez M√°rquez sided with governor M√©ndez on the issue. Shortly afterwards, M√©ndez charged Las Alas with embezzling funds from the royal treasury, and suspended him from office. Las Alas claimed that M√©ndez and Men√©ndez M√°rquez had conspired against him.Francis & Kole: 36 The king had given governor M√©ndez authorization to name his own lieutenant and successor, and M√©ndez chose his nephew, Juan Garc√≠a de Navia. Rather than attack governor M√©ndez directly, Arg√ºelles conducted a letter-writing campaign against Garc√≠a and other officials appointed by M√©ndez, and against M√©ndez's handling of the Guale rebellion.Francis & Kole: 116-118 Alarmed at repeated incursions into the province of Guale by French sassafras traders, who were coming and going unmolested in the harbors of the coast, Arg√ºelles implored Governor Men√©ndez M√°rquez to send Timucuan allies with Spanish troops to seize their canoes and burn their food crops, as well as to seize some of the young men and enslave them. Men√©ndez M√°rquez's successor, M√©ndez de Can√ßo, employed these tactics, thus reviving M√°rquez's \\"war of fire and blood\\" against the rebel Guale.

Built in 1868-1870 in the vicinity of Cumberland Furnace, the three-story house was a summer residence for Nashville socialite Mary Florence Kirkman and her husband Captain James Pierre Drouillard. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 27, 1977. History When established in 1795 by Gen. James Robinson, Cumberland Iron Works was the first furnace in Middle Tennessee. After a lacklustre decade, the iron works and the surrounding 640 acres were bought by Montgomery Bell for $16,000 in 1804; Bell \\"quickly turned Cumberland Furnace into a money-maker\\" and was able to sell it, together with the surrounding acres, for thrice the amount of money he had paid for it to Anthony Wayne Van Leer in 1825. Van Leer was a member of a well known historical family in Pennsylvania and noted in the anti-slavery cause. Van Leer and partners operated the iron works for the next four decades, up until the beginning of the American Civil War, when he shut down the iron works business and he moved to Nashville. Most of his relatives stayed in Pennsylvania. For a few years, the Cumberland Furnace was managed by Van Leer's son-in-low, Hugh Kirkman, husband of his daughter, Eleanora C. VanLeer. After the death of Anthony Van Leer on July 9, 1863, the furnace and the surrounding area - were inherited by his grandchildren, Hugh and Eleonora's daughter, Mary Florence Kirkman, and her brother VanLeer Kirkman. Florence married Union Army Captain James Pierre Drouillard in 1864, a scandalous act in the southern state of Tennessee during the Civil War. None of her friends or family attended the wedding. Captain Drouillard reopened the furnace after the war, and operated it until it was sold in 1889 to the Southern Iron Company. Designed after a similar house in Newport, the Drouillard House was built in 1870. It was used to host lavish summer parties for guests from Nashville and even New Orleans until 1886 when the Drouillards returned to Nashville. During this time, the Drouillards built a church for the community and a parish school for both white and black children; the St. James Episcopal Church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well. Architecture Completed in 1870, the Italianate style house is clapboard siding over frame, with a 10 foot deep veranda porch over 100 feet in length skirting the north facade. The house has two wings, the kitchen is in the east wing. A three-story spiral staircase reaching up to an observation deck is a notable interior feature.

The posting system is a baseball player transfer system that operates between South Korea's Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) and the United States' Major League Baseball (MLB). The system is based on the original posting system that was put in place between MLB and Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball in 1998. To be eligible for posting, a player must have first played at least seven years in the KBO.Adams, Steve. \\"MLB, KBO Reportedly Agree To New Posting System,\\" MLB Trade Rumors (July 12, 2018). Under this system, when a KBO player is \\"posted,\\" MLB holds a four-day-long silent auction during which MLB teams can submit sealed bids in an attempt to win the exclusive rights to negotiate with the player for a period of 30 days. If the KBO team accepts the winning bid, then the player is free to negotiate with the highest-bidding MLB team. If the MLB team and the KBO player agree on contract terms before the 30-day period has expired, the KBO team receives the bid amount as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If the KBO team rejects the winning bid or if the MLB team cannot come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his KBO team. Up to the end of the 2014‚Äì15 posting period, eight KBO players had been posted using the system. Of these, two signed Major League contracts immediately, one signed a minor league contract, four bids were rejected by KBO teams, and one could not come to a contract agreement during the 30-day negotiation period. The three players that have been acquired by MLB teams through the posting system are Hyun-jin Ryu, Jung-ho Kang, and Byung-ho Park.

Both Stewards of Memphis Ipy, also transliterated as Apy, was a court official from the time of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten during the Egyptian 18th Dynasty. Ipy was High Steward of Memphis, and a royal scribe. Biography Ipy came from a family of well-known court officials. He was the son of Amenhotep (Huy), the High steward of Memphis and his wife May, and he was the grandson of the Mayor of Memphis Heby. The Vizier Ramose was an uncle of Ipy.Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Egypt from Golden age to Age of Heresy, The American University in Cairo Press, 2014 Ipy succeeded his father sometime after the first Heb-Sed festival of Amenhotep III.

Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign University of Michigan Press. 2001 He continued in office under Akhenaten, and eventually did not just work in Memphis, but was a presence in Akhetaten as well. In Akhenaten's year five Ipy wrote a report to the King reporting that both state and temple properties in Memphis were faring well. After that Ipy became the Overseer of the inner palace of pharaoh in Akhetaten. Ipy is known to have had a house in this city as well. Tombs According to Dodson Ipy had a tomb prepared in Thebes, namely TT136. This tomb is said to have included four images of Akhenaten in an Osirian pose. However Ipy was never residing in Thebes, making it unlikely that he was the owner of this tomb.St√©phane Pasquali, Beatrix, Gessler=Loehr: Un nouveau relief du grand intendant de Memphis, Ipy, et le temple de Ptah du terrain-b ø·∏•, in: BIFAO 111 (2011), p. 288 online Ipy may have also had a tomb prepared in Amarna.

He was born in Cooroy, Queensland and died at Gerringong, New South Wales. He was no relation to Tom Dollery, his captain at Warwickshire. Dollery was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a right-handed lower order batsman. He took a long time to establish himself in first-class cricket, playing without success in two first-class matches for Queensland in 1947‚Äì48 and in two further games in New Zealand for Auckland in 1949‚Äì50. He finally took his first wickets in his fifth game, played for Tasmania against Victoria in what was traditionally a first-class match, although Tasmania was at that stage not included in regular first-class fixtures with other Australian state teams: having taken two wickets in the first innings, in the second innings of this match Dollery took five for 60. That same Tasmanian season, he played twice against the English touring team, which included senior Warwickshire professional Eric Hollies, and from the start of the 1951 English cricket season Dollery began the residential qualification period for Warwickshire. He also played for Stockport in the Central Lancashire League. Dollery was limited to second eleven fixtures and single first-class games against the touring sides in both 1951 and 1952, and his full-time cricket career did not begin in earnest until the 1953 season. Warwickshire's fast bowling was in transition, with Charles Grove past the age of 40 and Tom Pritchard in his late 30s, and Dollery was one of a group of younger players that included Jack Bannister and Roly Thompson, and others, though some were not always available because of National Service; Dollery enjoyed a good run in the first team in the first half of the 1953 season, and took 74 wickets at the respectable bowling average of 21.86 runs per wicket. His best return came in the match against Gloucestershire when he took six wickets for 38 runs in the first innings and then, bowling unchanged with Bannister, a further four for 22 in the second innings when Gloucestershire collapsed to 56 all out, Dollery taking the last three wickets in three balls, a hat-trick. Dollery's record in the 1954 season was similar, with 72 wickets at a slightly higher average of 24.75 and, again, most of his regular cricket played in the first half of the season. He was awarded his county cap in this season. In the match against Sussex, he took eight first-innings wickets for 42 runs, the best return of his career, with five of his victims clean-bowled. From 1955, however, Dollery's career with Warwickshire took a downward turn. Picked for only about half the first-team matches in 1955 and overtaken by both Bannister and Thompson, he took only 38 wickets and his average was more than 30 runs per wicket, high for this period of English cricket. In 1956, there were days of individual triumph: against Gloucestershire, he took five wickets for 77 runs; against Kent he again took three wickets in three balls, a second hat-trick. But by mid-July he was out of the team and this time he did not return, not being re-engaged by the county at the end of the 1956 season, although he made a single second eleven appearance in 1957.

He joined the French Royal Army and served in an infantry regiment during the American Revolutionary War before retiring to his estates in 1780. When the Vendean insurrection broke out in 1793 he was chosen as the leader of the southern army. He led rebel forces at Lu√ßon, Cholet and Entrames. He was fatally wounded at Entrames on 26 October and died at Baug√©-en-Anjou. Early life Charles Aim√© de Royrand was born on 14 March 1726 in Saint-Fulgent, one of three sons of Charles Samuel de Royrand and Louise Jacquette Sageot, all named Charles. The two others were Charles Louis and Charles Augustin. A fourth son Ren√© Fran√ßois was born in 1735. Charles Aim√© joined the Navarre Infantry Regiment and later transferred to the Armagnac Regiment. After fighting in the American Revolutionary War and possibly in the earlier French and Indian War, he returned to France in 1780 and retired to his properties which were located near Saint-Fulgent, Chavagnes-en-Paillers and Saint- Georges-de-Montaigu. During his years of military service he was awarded the Order of Saint-Louis. Vendean rebellion Army command and Lu√ßon Map of La Vend√©e in 1793 Upon the outbreak of the War in the Vend√©e, the local Vendeans offered to make Royrand their leader but he was reluctant to accept at first. He was soon recognized as leader of the so-called Army of the Center which defended the southern front of the Vend√©e. He proved to be a capable organizer while assigning his second-in-command Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie to lead the rebels in the field. The rebels formed into three main forces of which the Army of Upper Vend√©e was the largest, with up to 50,000 men. The Army of Lower Vend√©e under former naval officer Fran√ßois de Charette had as many as 20,000 rebels in the western marshes, while the Army of the Center counted between 10,000 and 12,000 men in the area around Les Herbiers and Chantonnay. The rebels were opposed by the Republican Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg, Army of the Coasts of Brest under Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux and Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle under Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duke of Biron. While Canclaux held Angers, Nantes and the west coast department of Loire-Inf√©rieure, Biron was responsible for Les Sables-d'Olonne, Lu√ßon, Fontenay-le-Comte, Niort and Saumur. In March the Republicans deployed 34 volunteer and two regular infantry battalions plus two regiments of cavalry. The National Convention rushed reinforcements to the scene including 12 poorly-disciplined volunteer battalions from Paris under Antoine Joseph Santerre. In May 1793, while Royrand's army watched the southern edge of the Vend√©e, the rebels seized Bressuire and Thouars in the east. On 13 May they captured La Ch√¢taigneraie but were repulsed from Fontenay on the 16th. The main army of 35,000 men assembled under Charles de Bonchamps, Maurice d'Elb√©e, Henri de La Rochejaquelein and Louis Marie de Lescure. On 25 May, the Vendean army defeated 14,000 Republicans under Alexis Chalbos in the Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte, taking 40 guns. This was followed by a rebel victory over Jacques-Fran√ßois Menou's division at the Battle of Saumur on 9 June in which the Vendeans captured 46 cannons. On 28 June, Royrand attacked Lu√ßon but Claude Sandoz and its Republican garrison drove him off. On the 29th Canclaux repulsed a Vendean attack in the Battle of Nantes. Meanwhile, Biron sent Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann on a destructive raid into the heart of the Vend√©e. The main rebel army massed against Westermann and routed his division in the First Battle of Ch√¢tillon on 5 July. Battle of Lu√ßon The Republican generals disagreed over how to deal with the rebellion. Biron and Canclaux wanted to mount a concentric attack while the generals and representatives on mission at Saumur, which had been reoccupied, desired to attack from the east and drive the rebels against the seacoast. Ignoring Biron's wishes, 12,000 men of the Saumur division under Jacques-Marie Pilote La Baroli√®re moved west. On 18 July, the Vendeans attacked and routed the Republicans in the Battle of Vihiers. Biron was recalled to Paris and sent to the guillotine on 31 December 1793. Biron was replaced by Jean Antoine Rossignol, a political demagogue. Facing Royrand in the south were the Lu√ßon division under Augustin Tuncq and the Fontenay Division under Chalbos. On 25 July Tuncq occupied Chantonnay, burning the town and destroying food and weapons before returning to Lu√ßon. Provoked by this raid, Royrand and Elb√©e with 12,000‚Äì15,000 rebels attacked Lu√ßon but were repulsed on 30 July. Wanting to secure their southern flank, the Vendeans determined to move against Lu√ßon again. On 12 August the forces of Charette and Elb√©e joined Royrand's Army of the Center at Chantonnay. Overconfident in rebel numerical superiority, Lescure advised engaging the Republicans in an open plain. Because Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers carried out an effective reconnaissance, Tuncq was aware that the rebels were massing for a big attack. He deployed 9,000 troops and 31 guns in a double line on some hills outside Lu√ßon. On 14 August 1793, in the Battle of Lu√ßon, 14,000‚Äì35,000 Vendeans mounted an assault with Charette and Lescure on the right, Elb√©e and Royrand in the center and La Rochejaquelein on the left. At first, Charette and Lescure's men pushed back the Republican left flank and overran five guns, but the attacks were poorly timed and the column of Elb√©e and Royrand came up too late. After the first Republican line retired, the second line stood up and launched a surprise counterattack. Marceau with some cavalry and infantry threw back the rebel right flank. The Republican artillery was ably handled, inflicting losses and demoralizing Royrand's men. La Rochejaquelein's column only arrived in time to cover the retreat. The Vendeans suffered 1,500 casualties and abandoned 18 guns. Chantonnay, Cholet and Entrames Battle of Saint-Fulgent Tuncq sent 7,000 soldiers under Ren√© Fran√ßois Lecomte and Marceau north to occupy Chantonnay in an exposed position. Scolding his generals for not cooperating, Rossignol ordered Chalbos to seize La Ch√¢taigneraie. Feeling threatened by Republican control of Chantonnay, the Vendean leaders decided to retake it. Sending Royrand to make a feint against Quatre Chemins, 25,000 rebels and 21 cannons attacked the Lu√ßon Division. On 5 September 1793 the Vendeans crushed the Republicans in the Battle of Chantonnay. Only 2,500 of the 7,500 Republicans escaped the disaster and Lecomte and Marceau were ordered to rebuild the division. At this point the Republican position in the Vend√©e was saved by a Prussian blunder. On 23 July 1793 the Siege of Mainz ended with the capitulation of the French garrison. According to the terms, the French soldiers were paroled on condition that they not fight against the Coalition for one year. As Alexandre de Beauharnais pointed out, the terms did not exclude the garrison from fighting against Vendean rebels. Soon 14,000 veteran soldiers of the so-called Army of Mainz under Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet were on the march for the Vend√©e. In early September the reinforcements joined Canclaux at Nantes. The Republican generals and representatives agreed to mount a converging attack on the Vend√©e with the main thrust coming from Nantes. However, Rossignol failed to cooperate, ordering the Lu√ßon and Fontenay Divisions to retreat. Consequently, with Royrand's army watching the quiet southern sector, the other Vendean armies concentrated against the remaining Republican columns. On 18 September, Santerre's Saumur Division marched into an ambush in the Battle of Coron and was routed. Canclaux's offensive made progress at first but his columns were beaten at the Battle of Tiffauges on 19 September and the Battle of Montaigu three days later. The Sables-d'Olonne Division was smashed by Charette at the Battle of Saint-Fulgent. Canclaux and Rossignol mounted a new offensive resulting in a success at the Battle of Saint-Symphorien on 6 October, but their earlier defeats and the conniving of the radical Charles-Philippe Ronsin brought about a reshuffling of Republican commanders in early October. Canclaux and Du Bayet were dismissed, Rossignol was transferred to lead a weakened Army of the Coasts of Brest and a new force, the Army of the West was placed under Jean L√©chelle. The new army absorbed the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle, Canclaux's troops at Nantes and the Army of Mainz. At this time, the Vendean leaders failed to cooperate effectively. Charette became preoccupied with capturing Noirmoutier on the coast. In the east, the Saumur, Thouars and Fontenay Divisions united at Bressuire under Chalbos and Westermann and moved west. The Lu√ßon and Sables-d'Olonne Divisions were ordered north to join L√©chelle's main Republican army near Tiffauges. As the Lu√ßon Division advanced, it captured Les Herbiers from 3,000 rebels under Royrand. The Republican columns moved swiftly, forcing the Vendeans forces led by Royrand, Elb√©e, Bonchamps and Lescure to regroup near Cholet. While trying to contact the main army's advance guard under Michel de Beaupuy, the Lu√ßon Division was ambushed in the Battle of La Tremblaye on 15 October. After its commander became a casualty, Marceau took over and with help from Beaupuy, drove off the rebels. Lescure was badly wounded. Crossing the Loire at Saint-Florent The Republicans occupied Cholet on 16 October and Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber prepared to defend the town from rebel attack. Kl√©ber deployed 22,000 soldiers and 30 guns, many of them Army of Mainz veterans. He placed Beaupuy and Nicolas Haxo on the left, Marceau in the center and Louis Antoine Vimieux on the right. During the night Chalbos and Fran√ßois Muller arrived with 9,000 reinforcements. On 17 October 1793 the Republicans were attacked by 41,000 Vendeans in the Battle of Cholet. Elb√©e and Bonchamps led the center while Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and La Rochejaquelein directed the wings. Royrand was not mentioned. After a bitter struggle, the Republicans routed the rebels with heavy losses. Elb√©e was severely wounded and Bonchamps died the following day. The Vendean army crossed to the north bank of the Loire at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil while the Republican soldiers celebrated their victory by running amok in Cholet and Beaupr√©au. The Catholic and Royal Army, numbering 50,000, including 30,000‚Äì35,000 fighting men, elected La Rochjaquelein as their leader. They hoped to recruit Bretons to their cause, but the local people stayed home. The Vendeans moved to Laval with the Army of the West in pursuit. L√©chelle quickly proved incapable of leading an army. After passing through Ch√¢teau-Gontier on 25 October, the Republican advance guard under Westermann blundered into a Vendean ambush south of Laval and was driven back. Though both Kl√©ber and Marceau advised caution, L√©chelle and the representatives insisted on an advance the next day. Unwisely, L√©chelle ordered that the 25,000-man army march to battle in a single column. The next morning, Beaupuy and Marceau encountered the rebels near Entrammes. Kl√©ber soon brought his division into the fight, but with the army strung out on a single road it proved difficult for the Republicans to get more troops into action. In fact L√©chelle remained in the rear during the entire battle and failed to commit the reserve. Led by La Rochejaquelein and Royrand in the center, the Vendeans forced back the Republicans, turning captured cannon against their former owners. After another rebel force hit them in flank, the Republican soldiers began to flee. In the Battle of Entrames on 26 October the Vendeans dispersed the Army of the West inflicting very heavy losses and capturing 19 cannons. Royrand was mortally wounded at Entrames. After he fell, La Rochejaquelein urged Royrand's followers to avenge their leader. Royrand lingered until 5 December 1793, when he died near Baug√©-en-Anjou. Family The family suffered tragically in the rebellion. Brother Charles Augustin was born on 9 March 1731 at Montaigu and became a French naval officer. Wounded fighting the British in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, he acquired the nickname Bras-Coup√© (Arm-Off). He retired to his home in Chavagnes-en-Paillers. When the revolt broke out, the Vendeans asked Charles Augustin to lead them and he was killed in the fighting at La Gu√©rini√®re on 19 March 1793. His nephew was Charles C√©sar, son of brother Charles Louis Royrand de Roussi√®re and Th√©r√®se Charlotte du Chaffault, daughter of Admiral Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besn√©. Charles C√©sar de Royrand and his wife Emile Louise Gabrielle de Suzannet emigrated to Brussels in 1791. He fled to the Dutch Republic and finally to England where he joined the emigre Hector Regiment as a sous-lieutenant. Taking part in the Expedition to Quiberon Charles C√©sar was captured and executed by the Republicans on 2 August 1795.

The Hollywood Reporter Justin Lowe stated that the film \\"mines a rich vein of humanism shot through with characteristically dry New England humor\\", with Ongaro's \\"unsentimental empathy\\" a tone \\"too often missing from outsider perspectives\\". In a review for Indiewire, Katie Walsh described Tarasuk as \\"wonderfully natural, open, and unstudied\\", though also wrote that the \\"story of the making of Bob and the Trees is probably the most interesting thing about the film itself\\", and that it \\"could stand to lose about 10 minutes in [an] edit\\". Ben Kenigsberg of Variety drew comparison between the film's visuals and woodland work by Kelly Reichardt, and praised Tarasuk's \\"introverted performance\\". Kenigsberg called the film's resolution \\"at once pleasingly down-to-earth\\", but also \\"a little easy\\". At the 50th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the film won the Crystal Globe, the festival's main award, which included a cash prize of USD$25,000 (EUR‚Ç¨22,400). It showed at the Durban International Film Festival on July 21, 2015, at the Woods Hole Film Festival in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on July 28 and August 1, 2015 and at the Molodist festival in Kyiv in October 2015.

Origin of name Excerpt from Albert James Pickett's History of Alabama, and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period (1851): > 1788: About this time, a bloody transaction occurred in the territory of the > present county of Conecuh. During the revolutionary war, Colonel McGillivray > formed an acquaintance with many conspicuous royalists, and, among others, > with Colonel Kirkland, of South Carolina. That person was at McGillivray's > house, upon the Coosa, in 1788, with his son, his nephew, and several other > gentlemen. They were on their way to Pensacola, where they intended to > procure passports, and settle in the Spanish province of Louisiana. When > they determined to leave his hospitable abode, McGillivray sent his servant > [slave] to guide them to Pensacola. The presence of this servant would > assure the Indians that they were friends, for it was dangerous to travel > without the Chieftain's protection. Colonel Kirkland and his party had much > silver in their saddle-bags. Arriving within a mile of a large creek, which > flows into the Conecuh, they met a pack-horse party, about sunset, going up > to the nation. They had been to Pensacola, on a trading expedition.

This entropy can take a number of forms. The first form can be termed a density of states based entropy. The Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution implies that each eigenstate of a system, , is occupied with a certain probability, . As the entropy is given by a sum over the probabilities of occupation of those states, there is an entropy associated with the occupation of the various electronic states. In most molecular systems, the energy spacing between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is usually large, and thus the probabilities associated with the occupation of the excited states are small. Therefore, the electronic entropy in molecular systems can safely be neglected. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the Fermi level can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior. A second form of electronic entropy can be attributed to the configurational entropy associated with localized electrons and holes. This entropy is similar in form to the configurational entropy associated with the mixing of atoms on a lattice. Electronic entropy can substantially modify phase behavior, as in lithium ion battery electrodes, high temperature superconductors, and some perovskites. It is also the driving force for the coupling of heat and charge transport in thermoelectric materials, via the Onsager reciprocal relations. From the density of states General Formulation The entropy due to a set of states that can be either occupied with probability p_i or empty with probability 1-p_i can be written as: :S=-k_{rm B}sum_i n_i [ p_i ln p_i + (1-p_i) ln( 1 - p_i ) ] , where is Boltzmann constant. For a continuously distributed set of states as a function of energy, such as the eigenstates in an electronic band structure, the above sum can be written as an integral over the possible energy values, rather than a sum. Switching from summing over individual states to integrating over energy levels, the entropy can be written as: :S=-k_{rm B} int n(E) left [ p(E) ln p(E) +(1- p(E)) ln left ( 1- p(E)right ) right ]dE where is the density of states of the solid. The probability of occupation of each eigenstate is given by the Fermi function, : :p(E)=f=frac{1}{e^{(E-E_{rm F}) / k_{rm B} T} + 1} where is the Fermi energy and is the absolute temperature. One can then re-write the entropy as: :S=-k_{rm B} int n(E) left [ f ln f +(1- f) ln left ( 1- f right ) right ]dE This is the general formulation of the density-of-states based electronic entropy. Useful approximation It is useful to recognize that the only states within ~ of the Fermi level contribute significantly to the entropy. Other states are either fully occupied, , or completely unoccupied, . In either case, these states do not contribute to the entropy. If one assumes that the density of states is constant within of the Fermi level, one can derive that the electron heat capacity, equal to: :C_V=Tleft(frac{partial S}{partial T}right)_{T,V}=frac{pi^2}{3} k_{rm B}^2 T n(E_{rm F}) where is the density of states (number of levels per unit energy) at the Fermi level. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as ).  Application to different materials classes  Insulators have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their band gaps. Thus, the density of states- based electronic entropy is essentially zero in these systems. Metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition metals, wherein the flat d-bands lie close to the Fermi level, generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like metals. Oxides have particularly flat band structures and thus can exhibit large , if the Fermi level intersects these bands. As most oxides are insulators, this is generally not the case. However, when oxides are metallic (i.e. the Fermi level lies within an unfilled, flat set of bands), oxides exhibit some of the largest electronic entropies of any material. Thermoelectric materials are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The thermoelectric effect relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as the driving force to establish a gradient in electrical potential is driven by the entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the thermoelectric literature, the term band structure engineering refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near the Fermi level. More specifically, thermoelectric materials are intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at the Fermi level, resulting in high electronic entropies. Instead of engineering band filling, one may also engineer the shape of the band structure itself via introduction of nanostructures or quantum wells to the materials. Configurational electronic entropy Configurational electronic entropy is usually observed in mixed- valence transition metal oxides, as the charges in these systems are both localized (the system is ionic), and capable of changing (due to the mixed valency). To a first approximation (i.e. assuming that the charges are distributed randomly), the molar configurational electronic entropy is given by: :S approx n_text{sites} left [ x ln x + (1-x) ln (1-x) right ] where is the fraction of sites on which a localized electron/hole could reside (typically a transition metal site), and is the concentration of localized electrons/holes. Of course, the localized charges are not distributed randomly, as the charges will interact electrostatically with one another, and so the above formula should only be regarded as an approximation to the configurational atomic entropy. More sophisticated approximations have been made in the literature.

Background On July 21, 1983, Diana Ross' concert at The Great Lawn of New York City's Central Park, attended by 450,000 fans,http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/diana-ross-rained- central-park-article-1.1404781 was cut short by a massive lightning storm. The concert was staged as a benefit to raise funds for a children's park, later known as the Diana Ross Playground, located inside the park at West 81st Street and Central Park West. The concerts were aired worldwide on the Showtime cable network, and directed by Steve Binder, who produced Ross' 1981 ABC network television special, as well as Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback special. Ross produced the concert. The concert was choreographed by Michael Peters, perhaps most famous for choreographing the video for Michael Jackson's 1982 smash hit, Beat It. The stage was designed by Tony Walton, who had the designed the scenery for Ross' 1978 film, The Wiz. The lighting designer was Allen Branton. The orchestra was conducted by longtime Ross collaborator, Joe Guercio. Ross performed gratis, the only expected revenue was to be derived from the sales of the concert's memorabilia. However, the storm destroyed all of the stands and materials. Ross's entrance involved Jamaica (Queens), New York's Bernice Johnson Dancers performing a West African-inspired dance in grass skirts, as images of Ross in full tribal makeup (designed by makeup artist Rene de Chamizo) were displayed upon the stage's 34-feet-wide- by-24-feet-high video screens. She appeared among the dancers in a rainbow- colored fringed Issey Miyake coat that she let slip seductively from her svelte figure, revealing a tight-fitting, beaded orange bodysuit, that she later covered with a matching chiffon robe, which blew dramatically in the wind, providing some of the concert's most iconic footage. The live broadcast was interrupted a few times when the cables were inundated with mud. Less than 25 minutes into her performance, dark clouds began to gather over the audience, and a downpour ensued. In defiance of the gathering storm, Ross remarked, \\"It took me a lifetime to get here, and I‚Äôm not going anywhere.\\" But young people were sitting high up on the metal sound towers as the lightning came toward the park. Ross begged them to come down. At one point, she said, \\"My children are here.\\" She didn't want them to see anyone get electrocuted. The crowd was rowdy to begin with, drinking beer, throwing bottles and shoving. As the storm became worse, the crowds pushed closer and closer to the stage. There was general fear of a stampede. Virtually naked in her bodysuit facing into the wind and rain, Ross controlled the mass of people, at one point even telling the police to put their arms over head to decrease the pushing. That evening's performance lasted 45 minutes before the storm's increasing severity, and pleas from various New York City officials and event producers, convinced Ross to leave the stage. Ross implored the audience to leave safely and quietly. She then hinted at a possible second performance, to take place the following evening, July 22. News reports noted sporadic incidents of muggings of concertgoers on their way out of the park. That evening, 2.26 inches of rain fell, two-thirds of that month‚Äôs total precipitation. Winds of nearly 50 mph were reported, and electrical power was disrupted for nearly 40,000 homes throughout the NYC metropolitan area during the storm. On July 22, 1983, the New York City Parks Department determined that the ground was dry enough for the crowd to stand on for a second concert, which began at 6pm that evening. Ross' second entrance involved her leaving her producer's trailer, in full costume, and running across a maze of technical cables to the opening strains of her 1981 Top 5 hit, \\"I'm Coming Out\\". Audience attendance estimates for the second concert typically range from between 350,000. Some of the concert's highlights included a performance of Michael Sembello (composer of Ross' #8 Billboard pop chart hit, Mirror, Mirror)'s hit Maniac, during which Ross danced with choreographer Peters, before performing a live recreation of her Pieces of Ice video and a cover of Jackson's \\"Beat It\\", while wearing a rhinestone-studded lingerie teddy-style costume. There were also muggings after this concert. Following the concerts, then-NYC mayor Ed Koch announced that the city had lost nearly $2 million. The initial production costs had not been covered by the lost merchandise, and the second concert required the hiring of all involved for a second performance, which was not in the production's original budget, nor was the grounds' cleaning required to make the second show possible. Koch wondered (to the press) how would the city build a playground, when the expected funds had not materialized. During a subsequent mayoral press conference, Ross personally handed Koch and Parks Commissioner Henry Stern a check for $250,000. Stern later said Ross‚Äô gift provided a far larger amount for the city than all the Central Park concerts combined since 1967. On September 11, 1986, groundbreaking for the Diana Ross Playground took place on Central Park West and 81st Street in New York. These two concerts were part of the Up Front Tour to promote Ross's 1983 album. TV Land awarded Most Memorable Television Performance in 2006, ABC Network chose it as one of the Top 20 Television Performances and VH1's 100 Greatest Moments on TV.

It is in Imo State, Nigeria. It evolved out of the old Owerri Local Government Area in 1996. Umuguma‚Äîa descendant of Arugo‚Äîis one of the 774 communities in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as Local Government administrative  History  The ancestral homeland of Umuguma was located on the banks of the Nwaorie river, where Holy Ghost College (Arugo High School) Owerri is now located. Oratta's offspring include Ekwema and Arugo. Ekwema begat Owerre and Arugo begat Umuguma. Since Umuguma endured suffering due to the actions of Owerre, many boundaries were redrawn in the latter's favor and thus most of the area is now known as \\"New Owerri.\\" This term was created by recent settlers and non-indigenous individuals. Others however, take a different stance, believing the Owerri Municipal Local Government relied on the moniker to usurp some Owerri West or Umuguma land for their use. European Incursion into Igbo Heartland Umuguma historically was the entry point for the rampaging British frontier force led by one Douglas that finally settled at Owerri. They arrived Umuguma around 1901 and camped there, until their water supply got very low. Having moved far away from Nwaorie over the years in the acquisition of farmlands, the resolve of the community was to shepherd the strangers closer to Nwaorie river. This communication was facilitated through their interpreters Messrs Igbani and Jumbo: Owerre Nchi Ise, eventually became the bridgehead for further incursion into Igbo heartland thus, benefiting from the benevolence of Umuguma. Of course, the Church missionaries were in close pursuit of the frontier force. The Church missionaries continued their sojourning northwards. Emerging City Today Umuguma is an emerging City hosting the Headquarters of Owerri West LGA, in Imo State Nigeria. Umuguma is being transformed rapidly from peri-urban status to an emerging urbanized city, adorned with dual carriageway. A traditional bread basket for the residents in the municipal capital of Imo State. Umuguma is host to the two largest Housing Estates in the State: Imo Housing Estate and the World Bank Financed Scheme for Low Income Housing estate and a Federal Low Cost Housing estate. It served as Headquarters of a Brigade in the 2nd Division of the Biafra Army, during the Nigeria-Biafra War (1967-1970). The last Airfield for Biafra was under construction in Umuguma when the war ended suddenly in 1970. Geography Umuguma stretches from the Northern part at the roundabout on Sam Mbakwe Avenue by Dream-Land Hotel, through the Coca-Cola Factory off Irete Road on the East, to the Federal Secretariat Complex on Port Harcourt Road to the West and through Port Harcourt expressway including all the Housing Estates - World Bank, Federal and Imo State Housing estates. It borders Owerre at the north, Nnekede at the west, Irete and Okuku on the east and Avu at the south. Umuguma contributed the largest landmass to the Owerri Capital Project in Imo State. Leaders The traditional leadership of Umuguma community includes an Eze and President General of the Town Union. Umuguma has five traditional villages: Umuome(First Son), Umunwanyi(first child, first Daughter), Umunkwo(second Daughter), Umuagu(Second Son) and Ogbuosisi. The traditional leadership (Eze) has evolved through several ruling houses. The Oparanozie ruling house in Umuome produced Eze Herbert Oparanozie (Nnayereugo of Avu/Umuguma Autonomous community) who died in 1987. Thereafter the position remained vacant for several years. In 2000, Eze Nnamdi Ugorji from Ogbuosisi was crowned and is presently the Eze Umuguma. The General Assembly of Umuguma is the Town Union deliberates on the social, political and economic well-being of the community and assists the Eze in maintaining peace and public order within the community. The affairs of the Town Union are presided over by the President-General, who oversees other Umuguma Town Union branch presidents, and is the custodian of the Town Union at home. The President-General is elected at a general assembly - the present elected President-General is Engineer Uzoma Kenneth Osuagwu (elected 2014).

Written by Argentine author Marcela Citterrio, the show follows the story of a teen-robot named Franky (Mar√≠a Gabriela de Far√≠a), who has been designed as if it was a real girl. In 2017, Nickelodeon adapted the series for its global audience and uses the translated title and slight name change to its titular character, \\"I Am Frankie\\". The first episode aired September 11, 2017. The adapted series stars Alex Hook as Frankie.  Series overview   Synopsis   Season 1 (2015)  Sofia Andrade (Paula Barreto) is a great scientist who works in robotics, is married, and has a daughter named Clara Andrade (Mar√≠a Jos√© Pescador). Her husband, Wilson Andrade (Jorge L√≥pez), is a writer of self-help books. For years, Sofia Andrade has been working on a new robot, a model called FR4NK13, later known as Franky Andrade (Mar√≠a Gabriela de Far√≠a). Franky is the biggest project of EGG Enterprises. When the project finally ended, Franky was ready, so Sofia Andrade sent her to school to live side by side with humans. Now, Franky will face all problems and most importantly, protect her secret from all. However, the most intelligent girl, Tamara Franco (Danielle Arciniegas), will not rest until she discovers Franky's great secret. With her friends, Franky will face all her problems and adapt to a world between humans. Clara Andrade is a very naughty and tender girl; Sof√≠a Andrade is caring and a great scientist; Wilson Andrade is a great crazy lover of books; and Franky is a robot with a human body, very intelligent, harmless and ready to help others. Miss Tamara Franco was always in love with Christian Montero L√©on (Mart√≠n Barba), but Christian is in love with Franky, although he does not know her real secret. Paul Mej√≠a (George Slebi) is a dull but goodhearted scientist who soon ends up proving that he can be good, likes copying the ideas of Sofia and believes that bad luck haunts him everywhere.

Tamara finds out Franky is a robot and threatens to tell Segundo about it to destroy her. Franky will be in trouble, because Segundo is the new principal of Franky's school. Roby Mej√≠a will also become a superhero, with the help of his parents. But he must be careful, as the girls are trying to find out who hides behind the mask of Andromax.  Season 2 Part 2 (2016)  After Kassandra leaves the town with Franky's memories, there's a mysterious girl who has a lot of secrets.

History The castle was originally built in the 14th century but over the next centuries was destroyed and rebuilt. An earlier 11th-century tower may have existed at the site. Documents from 1164 indicate that Emperor Federico Barbarossa conceded a castle or fortress at Montesegale to Pavia. The property was owned by the Count Gambarana by 1311, who became the lord of Montesegale. In 1415, in retribution for a rebellion against Filippo Maria Visconti, his general Carmagnola captured and destroyed the castle. Count Guido Gambarana was captured, tortured,Bollettino della Societ√† pavese di storia patria, Volumes 7-8 page 306. and executed. In 1451, Palatine Count Ottino Gambarana, the son of Guido, obtained from Duke Francesco Sforza restoration of his feudal inheritance. The position of the counts of Montesegale was confirmed by Emperor Charles V in 1525.La patria; geografia dell' Italia: Provincia di Milano, by Gustavo Chiesi, Luigi Borsari, and Giuseppe Isidoro Arneudo, 1864), page 269. The property passed on the Giussani family in 19th century, and then to the Jannuzzelli family. The castle has outer walls and an inner walled keep. The interior walls were restored in 1900 by Agostino Gambarotta. The portal to the inner courtyard has a Latin epigraph that reads \\"Fiat pax in virtute tua et habondantia in turribus tuis\\" (Psalms 121:7 [Vulgate]: \\"May there be peace in your strength and prosperity within your towers\\"). The castle portico has heraldic shields of the Gambarana family. In 1975, the castle became the site of the local museum of contemporary art.Comune of Montesegale, entry on castle.

It was released as a posthumous single by Hank Williams, whose records Rose produced, in 1954. Background Like Williams, Rose was an accomplished songwriter, having collaborated with Tin Pan Alley writers like Ray Whitley and composing country standards like \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" and \\"We Live in Two Different Worlds.\\" Williams recorded several of Rose's songs with varying degrees of success, including \\"Take These Chains From My Heart,\\" which shot to #1 after Hank's death in 1953. Rose also founded Acuff-Rose, the company that published Williams' songs, and Rose was not above pushing songs on Williams that came under Acuff-Rose, including his own compositions \\"Rootie Tootie\\" and \\"I'm Satisfied with You,\\" although this became less necessary as Williams blossomed as a songwriter. Rose was also very conscientious about recording songs that his company published. For instance, in 1949 Rose had been given carte blanche to sign country acts to MGM and he was considering Hank's friend Braxton Shuffert. Williams had given Shuffert the song \\"A Teardrop on a Rose\\" but they needed one more tune for the flipside. Shuffert later recalled: :\\"I was wanting to sing 'I'll Still Write Your Name in the Sand,' but Fred said, 'No- o-o, we don't give other folks royalties. I'm going over to the house for a few minutes. You and Hank write something.'...When Fred came back, I sang him 'Rockin' Chair Daddy,' and he signed me up that evening.\\" Between August 1948 and May 1949, Williams performed on KWKH in Shreveport, and it was from these recordings that \\"Faded Love and Winter Roses\\" was chosen by MGM to be a single in 1954. Although Williams performed songs by other singers like Ernest Tubb, Hank Thompson, and Roy Acuff, the surviving acetates are dominated by Rose compositions, and it was likely that Williams was using the radio program in part to promote his publisher's songs. Cover versions * Carl Smith had a minor hit with the song in 1969, taking it to #25 on the country singles chart. * David Houston cut the song for his 1979 LP From the Heart of Houston. Houston's version peaked at #33 in the Billboard country charts that year, making it his last top 40. * American bluegrass duo Jim and Jesse recorded it for their 1998 album Songs From the Homeplace.

She has made fossil discoveries of dinosaurs and other extinct animals on several continents, with finds in Canada, Argentina, Mongolia, France, and Greenland. She is commemorated in name of the horned dinosaur Wendiceratops, remains of which she discovered in 2010, as well as the fossil footprint Barrosopus slobodai which she discovered in 2003. Biography Illustration of Wendiceratops, which Sloboda discovered in 2010 In 1987, as a teenager, Sloboda discovered fossil eggshells in southern Alberta which she passed on to scientists, who uncovered multiple nests of hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs) including fossilized embryos. She enrolled at the University of Lethbridge in 1989 and in the summer of 1990, discovered a hadrosaur skeleton. She worked for sixteen years as a paleontological technician at the Royal Tyrrell Museum and started her own business, Mesozoic Wrex Repair, a fossil preparation and casting company, in 2001. She earned B.A. in history from the University of Lethbridge in 2001. Paleontologist David Evans, of the Royal Ontario Museum calls Sloboda \\"basically a legend in Alberta. She's probably one of the best dinosaurs in the world.\\" Her discoveries include the first pterosaur bonebed in North America,, reprinted in and a pterosaur leg showing evidence of predation by a small dinosaur that inspired author Daniel Loxton's 2013 book Pterosaur Trouble. Sloboda has made numerous discoveries in Alberta's Dinosaur Provincial Park, including fossil skulls of Corythosaurus, ankylosaurs (including Euoplocephalus) and crocodilians. In 1999, she discovered and prepared the first known fossils of a gravid (egg-containing) turtle. In 2005, along with paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, she described the oogenus Reticuloolithus: fossilized eggshells found in Alberta and Montana, believed to have been laid by maniraptoran dinosaurs such as oviraptorosaurs or dromaeosaurids. In 2003, while working in South America, Sloboda discovered a fossil footprint in Plaza Huincul, Argentina. The footprint was described as a new ichnospecies by paleontologists Rodolfo Coria, Philip J. Currie, Alberto Garrido, and David Eberth, who honored Sloboda by naming it Barrosopus slobodai, which translates as \\"Sloboda's muddy foot\\". In 2010, Sloboda discovered a rock containing a bone fragment in Southern Alberta, between the Milk River and the Canada-US border. Evans and Ryan described the remains as a new genus and species, dubbed Wendiceratops pinhornensis, with the genus name combining Sloboda's first name with the suffix \\"-ceratops\\", common in horned dinosaur names. In celebration of having a genus named after her, Sloboda had a drawing of the dinosaur and its scientific name tattooed on her arm.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in July 2015, and for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2017. Development Trove was first revealed on November 13, 2013 with players able to sign up to play the Alpha version of the game. Access to a closed Beta test was launched on September 25, 2014, a free week of Trove was out a month later on October 24‚Äì26, 2014. The game went in Open Beta on November 4, 2014. The console versions of the game went in open beta on December 13, 2016. Trove launched its Closed Beta in China on March 27, 2017.  Gameplay  Gameplay Screenshot Players assume the role of one of multiple classes each with different play styles and abilities. After a brief tutorial players arrive in a central area called the 'Hub'. In this area players can access Portals which act as access points to different in-game worlds each one tailored for a specific stage of progression. Each portal requires a minimum Power Rank to enter which gets higher per portal, allowing for progression from easier worlds to harder worlds as the player gains in level. Each world gets progressively harder but rewards higher levels of experience and better loot/resources. Each portal is of a specific color which is designed to indicate the quality of the 'loot' which can be most commonly located there, although there is a small chance that loot of a higher quality will be found. The exception to this is the higher level Red portals which predominantly drop Legendary (orange) quality loot but have a higher chance to drop loot of relic (red), resplendent (rainbow) or shadow (dark purple) quality as well. Higher Level Red portals have a better chance for to drop the rarer loot types. Loot Quality progresses from (lowest to highest) Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Relic, Resplendent, Shadow level 1-5, Radiant, Stellar and crystal In Trove only three of the equipable slot items can be obtained from defeating hostile NPCs, unlike in other RPG games. The items which can be obtained in this way are the hat, weapon and mask slot items. These items form the 'loot drops' left behind either when some enemies are defeated or when a reward chest is opened following the defeat of a boss type NPC. Players can obtain the other equipable items from crafting, the ingame store, trade NPCs, reaching certain levels of Mastery, or via ingame badges. These items include rings, alternative character costumes (which unlock as your character increases in level), tomes, allies (permanent pets that boost the player character's stats), wings, mounts, boats, sails, flasks (which are consumed to restore the player character's health), fishing rods, mag riders ( a form of quick travel mount limited to use on train-like mono- rails), and Emblems, which add to or alter the benefits provided by Flasks. A notable feature of Trove is the Collection. With the exception of Rings, Hats, weapons and masks, each of the other none loot drop items, once activated is added to the players library of unlocked items. Any character on that account can then access their own copy of that item from the collection and can select it from the corresponding item slot in their character equipment screen. For example, once you obtain a fishing rod on one character, you can activate it (default left mouse click) which will add the rod to your library. You then only have to select the fishing rod slot on the character screen to be taken to the fishing rod area of the library. Select the rod from the list and the item will be equipped. This can be done on any character on that account without restriction. Rings, masks, hats and weapons are not added to the library and so the player will only get one instance of the item unless more are found/crafted. If a player wishes to transfer the item between characters then they must first un-equip the item and change characters in order to equip it to the newly selected character. Players can trade items in the market for flux (in game currency) Character customization Any Weapon, Hat or Face that is placed in the Loot Collector will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the player's library allowing the player to choose to use that item's image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally, any item which is destroyed in the Loot Collector provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting. Players can also alter their character's face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone. Environments The Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals. The Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing. Each world zone contains various biomes that focus on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others. (Dragonfire Peaks, Candoria, Treasure Isles, etc.) Each biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone. The biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example, the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeons shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome. Classes There are numerous classes within Trove. Currently, these are the Vanguardian, the Dino Tamer, the Chloromancer, the Revenant, Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, and the Knight. Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied. Most classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be 'roamer' classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore. Each Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have built in cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat. Professions There are three Crafting professions, each with their own particular crafting stations. With each craft the level of the profession increases which in turn allows the player access to higher quality recipes for each increase of 50 levels, until the profession level reaches the maximum of 250. Players can also participate in Fishing, which can provide them with resources, items and trophies that are not obtainable via other means. However Fishing does not improve with levels and does not require a crafting station, unless the player is attempting to create more advanced fishing rods than the basic type purchasable from the Hub NPC, Saltwater Sam.

He held positions in the royal court in the 1270s. He acquired extensive landholdings and estates in the area between the rivers Tisza and Szamos (Some»ô). He was among the so-called oligarchs, who ruled de facto independently their dominion during the era of feudal anarchy. He was also ancestor of the Meggyesi noble family, thus later charters also referred to him as Nicholas Meggyesi. Family He was born into the wealthy Pok kindred, which originated from Gy≈ër County. He belonged to the M√≥richida branch, which erected a Premonstratensian monastery in 1251 at M√≥richida. The branch was founded by Maurice I, Nicholas' grandfather, who served King Andrew II as his Master of the stewards from 1233 to 1235. His only known son was Maurice II, Nicholas' father, who held several positions (most notably Master of the treasury) in the court of King B√©la IV at least until 1269. He married a daughter of Dominic I R√°t√≥t (she died before 1267) whom Nicholas was born around 1245. He had three younger brothers, Maurice III, Stephen I and Dominic, who were mentioned only once in 1280 when they were excommunicated due to \\"tyrannical behaviour\\". After Maurice's death, the brothers jointly owned Pok, T√©t, Bar√°ti and M√≥rchida in Gy≈ër County, along with other sporadic lands throughout the kingdom. Nicholas appeared first in contemporary records in 1270. According to the sources he married twice; his first wife was Elizabeth, a daughter of Mojs (II) D√°r√≥i, Palatine of Hungary between 1270 and 1272. She died before 1280. They had at least three sons: Maurice IV, the isp√°n of Gy≈ër County from 1337 to 1338, Stephen II, the isp√°n of M√°ramaros County between 1326 and 1327, and magister Nicholas II. Maurice's son was Simon Meggyesi, Ban of Croatia, thus Nicholas was also an ancestor of the influential Meggyesi family. After Elizabeth's death, he married for the second time to Catherine, daughter of Andrew from the Kaplon kindred. She survived her husband and died sometime after 1331.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Pok 1., Meggyesi, M√≥richida branch) It is a widely accepted academic standpoint that the wife of Palatine Mojs II (Nicholas' mother-in-law) had family relationship with the √Årp√°d dynasty, the royal house of Hungary through Queen Elizabeth the Cuman thus Nicholas Pok was also part of the √Årp√°ds' distant kinship. Furthermore, Palatine Mojs' other daughter was engaged to Henry II K≈ëszegi.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Mojs kinship 1.) Through his granddaughter Anne, Nicholas Pok was also maternal ancestor of the royal house of B√°thory de Somly√≥, which ruled in Transylvania and Poland in the 16th century. Life Political career under the √Årp√°ds When Stephen V ascended the throne in 1270 after a lengthy wait, Nicholas' career arose. At the preceding decades there were intense throne fights between B√©la IV and his son Duke Stephen who was later granted the title of Junior king. Although Maurice II Pok had formerly received the F√ºlek Castle (today: Fiƒæakovo, Slovakia) from B√©la IV in 1246 for his bravery in the Battle of Mohi during the Mongol invasion, however he later handed over the castle to Duke Stephen in 1262, who had openly rebelled against his father. This resulted that Pok genus was unable to get positions during the late reign of B√©la IV. Maurice II became isp√°n of Baranya County only in 1266, when father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on 'Rabbits' Island. Nicholas was donated five villages ‚Äì S√°rk√∂z (Livada), Avas and √öjv√°ros (Ora»ôu Nou), V√°mfalu (Vama) and Parlag (Prilog) ‚Äì by Stephen V in 1270 for possible former military achievements during the civil war. Through marriage he became resident of Szatm√°r County by then, after that his life and career tied to Transylvania. However his lord suddenly fell ill and died in August 1272, following Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica. During that time two rival baronial groups emerged (supporters of the minor Ladislaus and former partisans of the late B√©la IV, who returned to Hungary after Stephen's death), while the royal power was fatally weakened. The rivalry between the two parties characterized the following years. According to historian B√°lint H√≥man, twelve \\"changes of government\\" took place in the first five regnal years of Ladislaus IV. Nicholas Pok was appointed Master of the cupbearers in 1273 (19th-century historian M√≥r Wertner mistakenly identified him as Nicholas K≈ëszegi), however soon he had to give the position to Lawrence, son of Voivode Lawrence, who belonged to the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìGutkeled baronial group. Following that, when Ottokar II of Bohemia invaded Hungary and seized many fortresses, Nicholas participated in the Siege of Nagyszombat (today Trnava, Slovakia). In 1274, he was reinstalled as Master of the cupbearers, beside that he also served as isp√°n of Bereg, Keve, Krass√≥ and possibly Ugocsa Counties. For the participation in the campaign, Ladislaus IV donated him Hegymagas in Zala County. Following the Battle of F√∂veny, where Henry I K≈ëszegi, leader of the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìGutkeled baronial group was killed, members of the Cs√°k baronial group elevated. From 1274 to 1275, Nicholas functioned as Master of the stewards and isp√°n of Moson County. According to a non-authentic charter, he also held the dignity in 1278. In 1275, Joachim Gutkeled and the K≈ëszegi sons (Ivan, Henry II, Nicholas I and Peter) carried out a successful counter-attack, and Nicholas, among others, lost his positions. Nicholas and his brothers participated in Peter I Cs√°k's raiding expedition against the Diocese of Veszpr√©m (where Peter K≈ëszegi served as bishop) in March 1276, where their forces destroyed, burned and looted Veszpr√©m, the cathedral treasury and its chapel university which was never rebuilt. Several news reports and diplomas say that Nicholas Pok continued to plunder the Transdanubian dioceses in the following years, while he also invaded Tapolca in Zala County around 1278. Bishop Peter K≈ëszegi excommunicated the Pok brothers in 1280, but there were no any consequences for that. In retaliation, besides the punishment of excommunication, Peter K≈ëszegi's troops raided the family monastery of the Pok clan in the namesake village near Gy≈ër. He ordered to transfer its treasury, relics and jewelry to St. Michael's Cathedral of Veszpr√©m. In 1285, he personally led his episcopal army in the siege of the castle of Szigliget, also owned by Nicholas and his brothers. There, he confiscated the seized religious relics and values, including chasubles, books and gems for his diocese. Some historians connect and merge the two events, and consider the treasury of the Pok monastery were transferred to Szigliget Castle sometime after the Mongol invasion. In 1277, for a short time, Nicholas Pok held the positions of Voivode of Transylvania and isp√°n of Szolnok County. In accordance with a false diploma, he held these positions already in 1276. His voivode seal also preserved. According to Tam√°s K√°d√°r, Nicholas served as voivode until 1278, when he was replaced by Finta Aba. In the next two decades, Nicholas did not hold any political offices. This was the period when the independent domains were strengthened and gradually distanced themselves from the royal power. Establishment of the Pok domain The Pok dominion (orange) among the other oligarchs Under these chaotic conditions, Nicholas Pok, among others, also could establish a dominion independently of the king. Nicholas had started to expand his influence over the territories that surrounded his possessions and castles (e.g., Szamos√∫jv√°r). Presumably he also built the Somly√≥ Castle. Acquiring landholdings across the river Szamos (Some»ô), Nicholas became the incontestable lord in Northwest Transylvania for decades (in the basin between the rivers Tisza and Szamos), which later mostly was part of the so-called Partium from the 16th century. His territory roughly covered Szatm√°r, Ugocsa and M√°ramaros counties. Albeit Nicholas was one of the \\"oligarchs\\" in the Kingdom of Hungary plagued by anarchy, civil wars and fragmentation, he has not so much notorious like Matthew Cs√°k, Amadeus Aba or Ladislaus K√°n. Otherwise the Pok clan also had land possessions in Gy≈ër, N√≥gr√°d, G√∂m√∂r, Kraszna and Kolozs Counties. Nicholas and his brothers possessed contiguous lands, the Somly√≥ lordship (present-day »òimleu Silvaniei, Romania) in the region of Szil√°gys√°g (SƒÉlaj). Until 1285, they also owned Szigliget Castle in Zala County which was the kindred's only stone castle before 1290. Probably Nicholas seized the fortification arbitrarily without the permission of the king. The fortress of Medie»ôu Aurit (Aranyosmeggyes), Nicholas Pok's seat On 26 September 1280, Mojs II wrote his last will and testament, bequeathed his Transylvanian properties of Zolun and Meggyes (today Medie»ôu Aurit, Romania) to his daughter, the wife of Nicholas. Following this the entire family moved from Transdanubia to Meggyes which became Nicholas' court and the dominion's capital. Nicholas also erected a castle there. In the upcoming decades, his family adopted their surname Meggyesi after the caste, which functioned as the provincial seat of Nicholas's dominion. Meanwhile, Nicholas was widowed and later married Catherine Kaplon, a member of the local nobility, who was much younger than him as she was still alive in 1331. His name was mentioned next time on 7 August 1299, during the reign of Andrew III, when he was ordered as isp√°n of Ugocsa County by the king. He held that office until 1303, beside that he was also isp√°n of M√°ramaros County for at least twenty years, between 1299 and 1319. Oligarchs in Hungary during the Interregnum When Andrew III died suddenly in January 1301, a war of succession broke out between Charles Anjou and Wenceslaus P≈ôemysl, whom supported by his father, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. During that time the pretenders tried to convince the oligarchs to support them. Nicholas' position is unknown in the initial period, he did not take any realm dignity. He devoted himself to Charles only in October 1307, when the Anjou supporters had already occupied Buda in June 1307. Nicholas Pok took part in the Diet of R√°kos, where the nobles officially recognized Charles as their king. According to historians Gyula Krist√≥ and J√°nos Kar√°csonyi, Nicholas fought in the Battle of Rozgony on 15 June 1312, where the Aba dominion was annihilated. On 8 July 1312, he was a member of the king's inner council which convened in S√°rospatak, a former centrum of the Abas' province. According to a royal charter, Nicholas moved to Buda by 1 August 1313, where, alongside Palatine James Borsa and Treasurer Dominic II R√°t√≥t, judged in the name of king over Judge royal John Cs√°k, who betrayed Charles and became a partisan of his distant relative Matthew III Cs√°k. Role in Charles' unification war Transylvania was administered de facto independently by Ladislaus III K√°n since 1295. As a neighbor of his province, his rapid expansionist policiy meant a constant threat to Nicholas Pok's province in the north-western part of Transylvania. Ladislaus K√°n died either in 1314 or 1315. Following his death, Nicholas Pok was appointed Voivode of Transylvania in July 1315 by Charles, a position which was once already held by himself almost forty years ago. He also became the isp√°n of Szolnok County. However the K√°n kindred had several supporters in the region and the late oligarch's son Ladislaus IV K√°n also declared himself voivode thus Nicholas Pok was unable to take up his office. According to Tam√°s K√°d√°r, Nicholas Pok was appointed to the dignity because of his local interests and social embeddedness, in addition to his sporadic landholdings beyond the King's Pass (also known as Gate of Transylvania, which was considered the border between Hungary proper and Transylvania). Given his extensive estates, Nicholas may have been large number of loyal and reliable familiares, so he could quickly mobilize a serious force in a military campaign against the K√°n dominion. In the surrounding lands, Nicholas Pok was the most influential pro- Charles lord, who meant a counter-balance against the K√°ns' suppression for the local lesser nobles. Upon the order of Charles I, Nicholas crossed the north border of the province at Zilah (today ZalƒÉu, Romania), because Mojs II √Åkos, an ally of the Borsa clan, had rebelled against the monarch. The K√°n sons also joined the insurgent movement. Nicholas reached Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania) in the middle of November 1315, however the following campaigns have failed against Mojs √Åkos in Kolozs County. Because of uncertain chronology, there are several contradictory interpretations among the historians to outline the course of events. Historian P√°l Engel, who first attempted to reconstruct the order of events in his 1988 study, argued the peace between Charles and the Borsas has collapsed by the first half of 1316. Accordingly, James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus K√°n's sons and other lords, including Mojs. Engel, who connected their conspiracy with Stefan Milutin's campaign against Hungary, argued, they broke the rebellion around the end of 1316. As a part of this, Mojs was victorious over Nicholas Pok and expelled him from Transylvania. In contrast, historian Gyula Krist√≥ argued in his 2003 publication that the skirmish between Mojs √Åkos and Nicholas Pok took place already at the end of 1315. He highlighted that Nicholas last appeared as voivode in contemporary documents in April 1316. Accordingly, Nicholas Pok, who prepared a war against the K√°ns, arrived on a bypass road across the Meszes Gate (today in Mese»ô Mountains) from Lippa (today Lipova, Romania) to Transylvania because of Mojs' sudden rebellion, which interrupted and delayed the showdown against the K√°ns, as Krist√≥ considered. Historian Attila B√°r√°ny supported Krist√≥'s theory. K√°d√°r argued Nicholas chose Meszes Gate, because he tried to mobilize his spacious kinship and the royal nobility of the northeastern part of the country in the first instance. However historian Attila Zsoldos, who also examined the contents of Nicholas Pok's charters, in addition to the dates and locations, challenged Krist√≥'s interpretation in 2016. He argued, if, as Krist√≥ considered, Nicholas Pok arrived to prepare a war to Transylvania immediately after his appointment, he would not have dealt with insignificant estate affairs in his diplomas as he did. Zsoldos considered, the 1318 charter, which narrated the Voivode's appointment and the following events, twisted the years and Mojs was declared the king's enemy retroactively. He argued the Meszes Gate was chosen as a safer route than the K√°ns' freshly occupied territory. Thus Zsoldos supported Engel's chronology and dated Mojs' rebellion to Autumn or Winter 1316. After the defeat Nicholas had to leave Transylvania and was deposed by Charles I in the second half of 1316, or in early 1317 at the latest. Following at least one-year vacancy he was replaced by the skilled military leader D√≥zsa Debreceni who successfully fought against the K√°n clan and Mojs √Åkos and later also became Palatine of Hungary. Nicholas retired from the national politics and moved to his estate in North-Transtisza. He and his sons resided in Meggyes in February 1319. He was last mentioned alive in a diploma issued by Judge royal Lampert Herm√°n on 19 August 1319.

Howell and written by Andrew Shaw, based on the novel of the same name by Silvio Raffo. The film tells about a young patient of a female psychologist, who gave a promise to the dying mother to remain silent, until her spirit returns. The film, shot in Italy, stars Emilia Clarke, Marton Csokas, Caterina Murino, Remo Girone, Lisa Gastoni and Edward George Dring. The film was released on 28 April 2017 in limited release, video on demand and digital HD.  Plot  In post-World War II Italy, Malvina is on her deathbed at her ancestral home. She tells Jakob, her adolescent son, that another woman will come, a woman who will love him, and that the next words he speaks will call Malvina back to him. Seven months later a British nurse specializing in children‚Äôs care, Verena, arrives. Jakob hasn't spoken since his mother died and Verena is the latest English-speaking (per Malvina's wishes) nurse recruited by Klaus, Jakob's father. Verena meets estate keeper Alessio and retired house maid Lilia. Though polite, Jakob is cold and distant. Verena learns that Malvina's family owned the estate and surrounding quarries for 1,200 years. Malvina was the first descendant not to run the quarry, instead becoming a world famous pianist. Since most of the men who worked there died during the second world war, she allowed the quarry to flood, though Alessio still lights a flame for long-dead quarrymen, proclaiming \\"Life. Death. Love. The stone was everything.\\" When Verena looks in on Jakob one night, she finds him with his ear to the stone wall in his room, listening. Klaus fears that Jakob believes he can hear Malvina in the stone. Verena worries that she is inadequate and that Jakob's condition requires a mental health specialist. When Verena sees Jakob on the ledge of a tall tower, she endangers herself to rescue him - making her (and Jakob) realize that she cares for him and must stay to help him. She caringly explains that the voice he hears is real, but that it is just his mind playing tricks on him. The next day Verena sees him listening to Malvina's tombstone in the family mausoleum. Alessio informs her that 40 generations are buried there \\"in the stone\\". Verena, who was orphaned around Jakob's age, tells the boy that she already knows that wishing to hear dead loved ones does not make it happen. Verena, who cannot play piano, encourages the gifted Jakob to do so, as he has refused to play since Malvina died. Lilia, a confidant to Malvina, develops a close relationship with Verena. Lilia visits her room most evenings to talk about Jakob, and Malvina, and Verena's disconnected life of helping, then having to leave, a series of children. Verena becomes more attached to the stone, listening to walls, the quarry and even Malvina's tomb. She tears her skirt one day and Lilia gives her a dress of Malvina's. This initially angers Klaus, but upon seeing Verena in a state of undress, he notices the striking physical similarity between Verena and his wife. Klaus has stalled on making a sculpture of Malvina, and Verena agrees to model nude so the statue can be completed. Verena starts dreaming about sleeping with Klaus. Verena catches Jakob listening to the stone wall in Malvina's near empty bedroom. She joins him and hears Malvina's voice, confirming that her spirit is living in the stone. Verena speaks to a picture of Malvina, promising to care for both Jakob and Klaus. She sleeps with Klaus after he finishes his work on the statue, and Jakob becomes friendlier towards her, though still remaining silent. Klaus feels guilty and decides to fire her since Jakob still isn't speaking. Distraught, and suffering from the same fever Malvina had, Verena pleads with Jakob to speak so that she will not be sent away. When she does leave, Klaus suddenly begs her to stay in his and Jakob's lives. She wants to ask Lilia's advice, only to learn that Lilia committed suicide on the day of Malvina's death. As she flees the house she collapses and is carried to Malvina's bedroom. In her fevered state, she has numerous hallucinations. She sees Lilia, then sees Alessio entombing her with Malvina, who runs her hand over Verena's face. When Verena wakes up on the bed, seemingly recovered, Jakob sees her and finally speaks, \\"I miss my mama\\", to which Verena replies, \\"I'm right here\\". \\"Verena\\", who now wears Malvina's signature ring and plays the piano flawlessly, says that \\"I hardly know the woman I see. We are, none of us, quite who we were.\\" Alessio is pleased to see that \\"Malvina\\" is back, restoring the happy family.

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78, a 9-inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships, but accuracy was poor and they were later removed, probably in the early 1880s. Admiral Spiridov retained her original guns until 1902, although a more powerful 11-inch gun may have been installed after that date.

Stouronisi has recently become known because of some plans of the Greek government for a development of a high- class summer resort in the island. History In antiquity, the island was named Aegilia or Aigilia (), or Aigileia or Aegileia (Œë·º∞Œ≥ŒØŒªŒµŒπŒ±), and was referred by Herodotus. Herodotus writes that during the First Persian invasion of Greece (492-490 BCE), the captives from the Siege of Eretria were kept on Aegilia (which belonged to Styra) during the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE). After the battle, these captives were picked up, and eventually sent to Darius I in Susa, Persia. The Euboean Sea is an important passage for the ships, so around the coasts of Stouronisi, some ancient wrecks have been found. The submarine exploration of one wreck has been shot as part of an award winning documentary. The most notable ancient wreck belongs to Hellenistic era. During Greek War of Independence the island was used as shelter of Greek guerillas. Odysseas Androutsos and Nikolaos Krieziotis turned to the island those years.

BeliefNet called it \\"a poignant story of hope and solidarity, in spite of hate,\\" and suggested it gives a \\"raw, yet honest reflection of life as a Muslim in America.\\" The arson was the first hate-crime destroying a mosque in U.S. history. The Islamic Center had just been completed at an estimated cost of $1.8 million plus sweat equity of the Muslims of its rural community, including descendants of Pakistani who immigrated to the area 1902. A fire marshal established that the blaze was started deliberately. Law enforcement reportedly were able to identify the probable perpetrator(s) of the crime but lacked sufficient evidence to name and prosecute them. documentary produced by David Washburn and accompanying website (documentary first aired nation-wide on PBS July 11, 2015) The incident, seven years before 9/11, attracted relatively little attention at the time, and this is suggested to have contributed to the failure of law enforcement to solve the crime. The documentary includes interviews of Muslim members of the mosque, law enforcement officers, and others in the community 20 years later. The replacement mosque was completed in 2000. Before July 1, 2015. (continuation page) IMDb describes the film as: The film was to be screened and discussed at \\"Neighbor to Neighbor\\", an East Bay partnership of Christian, Muslim and Jewish organizations, in an event including filmmaker Washburn. The artist promoting the event noted that Washburn considered gatherings like that to be important for being proactive rather than reactive: \\"Although recent events like the terrorist killings in Paris and ongoing extremism by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram and al-Qaida cast dark shadows, Washburn said [by] reflecting on Islam in America, the focus of his documentary, the program will create a safe space where fears and frustrations can be shared.\\" (early 2015). Washburn has elsewhere spoken of the timeliness of the film. The film premiered on TV on PBS TV in New York City in June 2014. Making of the film David Washburn began the project in 2007. Washburn found that there was thin coverage of the event in local and national newspapers. Although interviewees were supportive of the project, it was necessary to go slow in the process of filming interviews and developing the story, in part as reconsidering the events still evoked raw emotions. Almost all mosque members interviewed about the event were being interviewed for the first time. The film, as available at Vimeo is approximately 27 minutes long.A low-resolution version of documentary at Vimeo, streaming, provided by Washburn, is 26 minutes 56 seconds long. IMDb however reports the film is 19 minutes long; the \\"Neighbor to Neighbor\\" screening announcement stated it was 27 minutes long; a 2014 blog stated it was 29 minutes long; and it is described at Vimeo as being a half-hour long.An American Mosque, at Vimeo See also *List of mosques in the United States References External links *AnAmericanMosque.com *Documentary trailer at Youtube, uploaded by David Washburn on January 29, 2014 *documentary at Vimeo, streaming in low-resolution 2012 short films Short documentary films American documentary films 2012 documentary films American short films Documentary films about Islam in the United States Films shot in California Yuba City, California Religiously motivated violence in the United States History of Sutter County, California American films ","title":"An American Mosque"},{"id":"47216373","title":"List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States, July 2015"},{"id":"47216383","text":"The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United Kingdom () is the ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom.

The film chronicles the transformation of a well-to-do family man into a hardened prison gangster, which he undergoes to survive California's penal system after he is incarcerated for his role in a deadly DUI car accident. The film stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Omari Hardwick, Lake Bell, Jon Bernthal, Emory Cohen, Jeffrey Donovan, and Evan Jones, with Benjamin Bratt, and Holt McCallany. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 16, 2017. The film was released on July 20, 2017, through DirecTV Cinema and theatrically on August 18, 2017, by Saban Films. Plot Jacob Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is a successful stockbroker living with his wife Katherine (Lake Bell) and son Joshua in California. Driving his wife and friends, Jacob unintentionally runs a red light, causing a collision; his best friend Tom is killed. It is later revealed that Jacob blew a .10 BAC after the accident. Advised to take a plea deal, Jacob is sentenced to 16 months at the California Institution for Men in Chino. Shocked by the brutality of prison life, Jacob heeds his lawyer's advice to stand his ground. He attacks an African-American inmate when provoked, drawing the attention of Bottles (Jeffrey Donovan), the ‚Äúshot caller‚Äù for a violent white supremacist gang. In return for protection and entry into the gang, Jacob is forced to smuggle heroin and kill a \\"snitch\\" within the gang. Nicknamed ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù, Harlon rises in rank and acquires gang-related tattoos. His personality and appearance change dramatically, hardened by prison. During a riot, Harlon stabs another inmate to save the life of Herman G√≥mez, head of the Sure√±os, but is caught on camera. Sentenced to nine more years, Harlon ceases all contact with his wife and son; Katherine eventually files for divorce. Harlon is transferred to Corcoran State Prison under maximum-security. Like other \\"heavy-hitters\\", he is only allowed one hour outdoors per day, spent in a steel cage. Harlon is introduced to Jerry \\"the Beast\\" Manning (Holt McCallany), who manages the gang‚Äôs activity from inside prison. Impressed with Harlon's dedication, Beast promotes him to his second-in-command. Set to be released after serving over seven years, Harlon is ordered by Beast to orchestrate a weapons deal with the Sure√±os; when Harlon hesitates, knowing he will be on parole, Beast informs him that membership in the gang does not end when leaving prison, it lasts for life. When Harlon hesitates again Beast threatens his family, causing Harlon to agree to obey the order. Harlon sends a letter to his son, and is released from prison. He is greeted by Frank \\"Shotgun\\" (Jon Bernthal) and other gang members, including Howie (Emory Cohen), a young war veteran with no criminal record. Escaping an attempt on his life, Harlon orders Howie to answer to no one but him. Harlon‚Äôs probation officer Ed Kutcher, part of a task force investigating the gang, is tipped off about the weapons deal and places Harlon under surveillance. As Harlon prepares to sell a cache of weapons discovered by Howie while serving in Afghanistan, Howie reveals that he does not want to become a gang member. Harlon takes this into consideration, remembering how he joined the gang. Harlon also discovers Shotgun is Kutcher‚Äôs informant. Harlon reaches out to Katherine, transferring his finances to her. Against Harlon‚Äôs wishes, Katherine brings Joshua to meet him. Harlon, realizing he has missed several years of his son's life, is devastated but holds his emotions. Joshua, demanding answers, is unable to understand his father's gang life. Harlon then closes the door between them. On the day of the deal, Harlon escapes his surveillance and goes to Shotgun's house where he stabs him multiple times, killing him. Kutcher finds Shotgun's body and retrieves his cellphone. After loading up the weapons and driving to meet the Sure√±os, Harlon texts their coordinates to Shotgun's cellphone. Deducing that Shotgun hid more of the weapons to sell himself, Harlon warns Howie to leave the criminal life and forces him out of the vehicle. As the deal closes, the police, ATF, and SWAT ‚Äì alerted by Harlon's text ‚Äì surround the gangs; only Howie escapes. Fully validated as a gang member, Harlon is sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole (due in part to California‚Äôs three strikes law). He turns down Kutcher's offer to testify against Beast in exchange for a full pardon. Harlon is returned to Corcoran, where Roberts, a corrupt guard, brings him to Beast. Realizing Harlon was responsible for the raid, Beast orders him back to his cell, to live out his sentence with the guilt that his family will be killed for his actions. Having smuggled in a handcuff key and a razor blade, Harlon frees himself and overpowers Roberts. Beast realizes that Harlon tipped off the cops, knowing he would be sent back to Corcoran, and giving him the chance to get at Beast. Beast compliments Harlon saying \\"Well played,\\" as they prepare to fight. Harlon unlocks Beast's cage and a brutal fight ensues leaving Beast mortally wounded. Harlon glares down at him whispering the words, \\"Nobody's touching my family.\\" A blood-soaked Harlon orders Roberts to claim that he acted in self-defense, and assumes Beast's place atop the gang hierarchy. With his family‚Äôs safety secured, Harlon accepts his life sentence, and notifies Kutcher about the remaining weapons. He receives a letter from Joshua, explaining that he and Katherine are moving on, and he has forgiven his father. Touched, Harlon realizes that sacrificing his own freedom to kill Beast was the only way he could truly protect his family.  Cast   Production  On April 9, 2015, Bold Films came on board to fully finance and produce the crime thriller film Shot Caller, to be directed by Ric Roman Waugh, based on his own script.

Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 45 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10 and the consensus reads \\"Shot Caller's weakness for action movie clich√©s is capably offset by strong work from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the central role\\".

He became Director of Opera Programming in 2003, and subsequently named ENO's artistic director in November 2005. The last appointment was controversial, as it occurred without either due process or interview. As ENO's artistic director, he brought in artists from outside the opera world into ENO productions, including film directors (Anthony Minghella, Terry Gilliam, Penny Woolcock, Mike Leigh), theatre directors (Rupert Goold, Simon McBurney, Fiona Shaw and Improbable Theatre), visual artists (Matthew Barney, Anish Kapoor) and choreographers (Mark Morris, Michael Keegan Dolan). His co-producing policy extended ENO's reach to more than 40 opera houses around the world, the most prominent being the relationship with the Metropolitan Opera House, New York. Berry expressed skepticism about cinema relays of operas in May 2012. In December 2013, in a reversal of those earlier statements, ENO announced a reversal of course and a new relationship with Altive Media to take ENO's productions into cinemas. Other developments at the company included, in 2014, a new relationship with restaurateur Ben Warner and Benugo for the redevelopment of the Coliseum foyer spaces, and a new commercial relationship with Lord Grade and Michael Linnit (the GradeLinnit Company) to produce semi-staged musicals. The last actions were in response to the 29% reduction in Arts Council England (ACE) funding. Awards won during Berry's tenure include: * Double Olivier Award winner in 2015. * Royal Philharmonic Society (RPS) for ENO's Consistently Outstanding Work 2015 in the Opera and Music Theatre Category * 8 Olivier Awards * 4 South Bank Show Awards * 5 Royal Philharmonic Society Awards * Winner of 2014 The Hospital Club 100 in Theatre for the \\"most innovative and inspirational people working across the creative industries\\" * Evening Standard (2013 / 2014 / 2015) Top 1000 most influential people in London In February 2015, ACE placed ENO under special measures. This had followed public revelations of disputes between the outgoing chairman of ENO, Martyn Rose, and Berry, with uncorroborated accusations by Rose that Berry had mismanaged finances and lost ¬£10M, and the departure of Henriette G√∂tz as executive director in January 2015. ENO countered Rose's accusation by stating that during Berry's tenure, ENO \\"turned over an unrestricted surplus of ¬£2.4M.\\" In July 2015, following the widely acclaimed 2014-2015 season at ENO, Berry stood down as ENO artistic director with immediate effect, stating \\"My work is now done\\". Other work  In July 2016 Berry was appointed creative advisor to the Bolshoi Theatre. In October 2017, he negotiated a co-production agreement between the Bolshoi and Metropolitan Opera NY for three operas, Lohengrin, Aida and Salome, all featuring Anna Netrebko. Berry was adviser to the Vienna Staatsoper from July 2018 to August 2019. Berry founded the charity Opera Ventures in March 2017, to produce opera and mixed media performances. In August 2017, Opera Ventures premiered its first new production, Greek, by Mark Anthony-Turnage CBE, co- produced with Scottish Opera and in collaboration with the Edinburgh International Festival. Its second production was Breaking the Waves by Missy Mazzoli, co-produced with Scottish Opera, Houston Grand Opera and Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra Comique in association with Bristol Old Vic. It premiered at the King's Theater in Edinburgh on 21 August 2019 with performances until 24 August. It opened at the Adelaide Festival in March 2020 to critical acclaim. Performances in collaboration with BAM NYC and The Metropolitan Orchestra conducted by their Music Director Yannick N√©zet-S√©guin, due to take place in July 2020, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2018 he officially launched a commercial theatre production company, Scenario 2, together with co-director Anthony Lilley OBE. Its first production is The light in the Piazza by Adam Guettel featuring Ren√©e Fleming and Dove Cameron, premiered at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall in London on 14 June 2019 with performances until 6 July 2019. The show then moved on to the USA, where its opening night took place on 12 October in LA in collaboration with Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. It then moved to Chicago from 14 to 20 December 2019 with outstanding reviews. In August 2020 it will premiere in Australia, where it will be presented at the Opera House in Sydney from 14 to 22 August. Scenario Two is also preparing a new staged musical production about the life of the late Italian Tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Personal life Berry is married to the mezzo-soprano Pippa Dames-Longworth. He was made a CBE in the Queens Birthday Honours in 2014, for Services to Music. References External links * Simon Tait, \\"The Big Interview ‚Äì John Berry\\".

The radio network broadcasts on 990 AM in Whangarei, Auckland and Hamilton, and plays Bollywood music alongside cultural features and discussions. The television channel is available on channel 26 on Freeview HD in major centres, and features mostly Indian and Pakistani television programmes. The Apna networks serve Indian, Fijian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Punjabi communities. The radio network is one of the only media outlets serving the Fijian population. Many of its hosts knew or worked with Radio Sargam presenter Anirudh Diwakar, who is crediting with inspiring Apna's \\"Fiji style\\" Hindi radio format. The station's internal research suggests many listeners also listen to Radio Tarana, Flava, Niu FM and Newstalk ZB. The radio network has not participated in independent TNS New Zealand audience surveys, unlike its competitors New Zealand Media and Entertainment, MediaWorks New Zealand and Radio Tarana. However, the station has commissioned research which suggests it has between 15,000 and 80,000 listeners. The research suggests these listeners are mostly middle-aged and listen to the station during the evening. History Language Journalist and media commentator Thakur Ranjit Singh has been critical of Apna presenters using pidgin, slang and Fiji Hindi rather than speaking the standard Hindi language. In December 2012, he wrote that the station was using the term \\"Daago mama\\", a shortened version of the saying \\"miyan ke kitchen, bappa ke jamin, ka bole mausa, Daago mama\\". Translated, the term meant \\"husband's kitchen, father's land, what say uncle, urging mother's brother\\". Singh argued the saying was colloquial and informal, and was not considered \\"appropriate\\" or \\"suitable\\" for a radio station. He accused Apna of compromising the language with \\"linguistic engineering\\". By comparison, Singh wrote, Radio Tarana had used a high quality of traditional Hindi, maintaining language decorum, sensitivity and proper usage. However, Tarana had failed to translate words into New Zealand English or explain words to unfamiliar listeners, excluding or putting off potential listeners, school children and other people who wanted to learn about the language and culture. Privacy complaints In 2010, the Broadcasting Standards Authority upheld a complaint against Apna over a dating segment, and ordered the network to pay $500 to the complainant for breach of privacy. The Apna Ne Bana Di Jodi segment allowed people to put forward personal match-making messages including their age, gender, ethnicity, religion and contact details. The complainant was featured in one of the segments, but said he had never submitted his details and had received harassment after the broadcast. The network informally apologised and promised to stop receiving dating listings via email. However, the authority found the telephone number was disclosed in a \\"highly offensive manner\\". In April 2015, the Broadcasting Standards Authority upheld a complaint against Apna for broadcasting details of a disputed business dealing between the station and the complainant's company. It related to a Hindi language segment in March 2014 in which a host named the company, alleged it owned money from a contract in 2011, and alleged the money was now long overdue. The host asked \\"any families of this business... listening to Radio Apna\\" to tell the company director to contact the station as soon as possible. The host also said the station would provide options for the account to be settled. The authority found the broadcast of those details was a misuse of airtime and the station neglected its obligation to protect the privacy of the complaint. The authority ordered the station to pay $1000 compensation to the complainant and another $1000 to the Crown. The authority found that debt was a private matter, the complainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and there was no public interest in publicly disclosing the debt. Programmes Radio The radio station's breakfast programme, Morning Spice with Shaiyaz and Ayana, airs from 6.00 to 9.00 am.

Television Apna Television is available on channel 36 on Freeview HD in Auckland, Waikato, Taranaki, Palmerston North, Bay of Plenty, Hawke's Bay, Christchurch and Dunedin. Apna Television broadcasts a range of Bollywood films, Indian drama, comedy and music. There are also some local shows hosted by Apna radio hosts. Apna broadcasts drama programmes like Kasam Se, Yahan Main Ghar Ghar Kheli, Saath Phere, Saloni and Pavitra Rishta. It also features culturally specific dramas, like the Muslim series Qubool Hai and the Sikh drama Ram Milaye Jodi. Many of its programmes are sourced from Zee TV, like reality talent show Shabaash India, dance competition Dance India Dance, and the Indian television adaption of Aladdin. Other shows include Johnny Lever comedy show Johny Aala Re and Sanjeev Kapoor cooking show Khaana Khazana. Events and promotions Alongside its normal broadcasting, Apna also organises, sponsors or broadcasts a range of events and promotions, including soccer matches, festivals and on-air charity appeals. For example, in 2009 it held a Best Flower Garden contest on Mother's Day. Charity appeals In 2009, Apna 990 raised $200,000 in a 54-hour on-air appeal for relief efforts following Fiji floods. This was double its fundraising target of $100,000. Many of the donations came from west and south Auckland, from Fijian Indians ith families in Fiji. The relief supplies were distributed across the Western Division to places like Lautoka, Ba Province and Nadi. In March 2010, the station held a 40-hour appeal to raise funds for victims of Cyclone Tomas in Fiji. The storm had caused widespread destruction to some northern parts of Fiji, leaving thousands of people homeless. Food was collected at several sites around Auckland, and a bank account was set up to deposit money towards the relief effort. Apna raised $133,000, and used the money to distribute flour, rice, dhal, milk powder, biscuits, onions, potatoes, salt, tinned fish, noodles, tea and soap to 2000 people. New Zealand volunteers travelled at their own expense to help distribute the supplies. In September 2010, Apna raised more than $270,000 in a 30-hour on-air appeal for the Pakistani flood disaster relief, almost double the $120,000 it was aiming to raise. The money was donated to a charity supported by the Pakistan High Commission, and was on top of $4 million donated by the New Zealand Government. The Pakistan Association of New Zealand congratulated Apna for raising the money, to providing medicine, water and food for people in need. In March 2011, Apna raised $100,000 for victims of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The money was raised to replace the Sikh Temple and Community Centre in Sydenham, and repair the Indian Hall in Phillipstown and Hare Krishna Temple in Richmond. Sikh and Muslim residents were affected by the earthquake, Indian businesses were destroyed, and Pakistan and Somalian communities hosted displaced families. The earthquake also led many migrant communities to relocate to Auckland temporarily. Labour MP Ashraf Choudhary congratulated Apna for their fundraising efforts. Muslim events Labour MP William Sio used a 2013 Eid Festival event sponsored by Apna to voice his opposition to same-sex marriage. Apna promotes itself as a Muslim media company, and targets ethnic communities with high Muslim populations. It supports and recognises a range of Muslim events. In September 2012, the company sponsored the Eid Festival at Mangere Centre Park, as part of New Zealand Islam Awareness Week. The sports and market festival was organised by the New Zealand Muslim Sports Association and the South Auckland Muslim Association, and was also supported by the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, the Council of Christians and Muslims and the Counties Manukau Ethnic Council. However, it lacked the endorsement of many Islamic Centres and Islamic leaders. Apna hosts played music, held quizzes and led recitations from the Quran. Labour Party MP William Sio used the event to discuss his opposition to same-sex marriage in New Zealand. Football In February 2011, Apna was the naming rights sponsor of the New Zealand Fiji Football Association's first Fiji Soccer Cup, organised in collaboration with New Zealand Football and the Fiji Football Association. The tournament was aimed at strengthening relationships between the Oceania Football Confederation teams, and giving New Zealand fans the opportunity to support Fijian players and teams. Fijj Football Association president Sahu Khan said Apna had made the event financially possible, and was already contributing to Fijian society in several other ways. The tournament marked the opening of a $2 million modern stadium at Centre Park in Mangere, and Apna managing director Sahil Shah was a patron of the stadium. Some members of the Fijian community described the tournament as the most important New Zealand football event of the year. Apna also airs live commentaries of local football and Oceania Football Confederation matches. It secured exclusive broadcasting rights to the New Zealand Fiji Inter-District Soccer Tournament from Centre Park in October 2009. It aired the commentary of a pre- season friendly between Auckland City FC and Wellington Phoenix in Sandringham in September 2013. The match was closely followed by members of New Zealand's Fijian community. Selected matches of the 2014 OFC President's Cup were broadcast on Apna, with match previews and reviews on LiveSport. This included the opening match, and other matches involving Auckland City FC.

He was best known for his genealogical and historical writings and his presidency of the American Fire Insurance Company, which he held for over 20 years until his death.  Early life  Thomas Harrison Montgomery was born in Philadelphia on February 27, 1830, the second son of reverend James Montgomery, D.D. and Mary Harrison White, and was baptized at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, where his father was then rector, April 7, 1830, by his great-grandfather, Bishop William White. His father died when Thomas was four, and he was raised by his mother. He attended grammar school in Philadelphia, and later attended some lectures at the Franklin Institute but was largely taught by his mother and self- educated. He early acquired the habit of expressing his thoughts on matters that came under his observation, by the writing of a journal which he began at the age of fifteen years.  Career  On March 23, 1847, he found his first job in the large drug establishment of Charles Ellis & Company, in connection with which he took a course in the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, 1848-9, and 1850-1, receiving his diploma from that institution April 4, 1851. In January, 1852, in partnership with his friend, Samuel E. Shinn, under the firm name of Montgomery & Shinn, he bought out a drug store, but ill health compelled him to abandon the business two years later. On his removal to Germantown, 1856, he began his genealogical studies, which resulted in the publication of the History and Pedigree of Montgomery, 1863. During this period he devoted much time to study and ecclesiastical and charitable work. He was rector‚Äôs warden of the Church of Holy Cross, Germantown, 1856, and later member of the vestry of St. Luke‚Äôs Church until his removal from Germantown. He also conducted for several years a Bible class for young men, which he had organized. During his residence in Germantown, Montgomery became associated with the family of physician and anthropologist Samuel George Morton, and in 1860, married his daughter, Anna Morton. At the outbreak of the Civil War, though the state of his health would not permit him to go to the front, he drilled with the troops then being recruited. In 1863 he was elected secretary of the Enterprise Insurance Company; became its vice president, 1864, and a director, 1866; thus becoming identified with the business wherein he achieved especial distinction by organizing and placing upon a safe financial basis the insurance institutions of Philadelphia and vicinity. In 1871, while convalescent from a severe attack of congestion of the lungs, he wrote the Genealogy of General Richard Montgomery. Failing to regain his normal health, on the advice of his physician, he decided to spend the winter at the south, and, October, 1871, sailed from New York for Frederickstadt, Island of St. Croix. A six months‚Äô sojourn there saved his life and made him physically stronger than he had ever been before. On October 31, 1871, the Enterprise Insurance Company failed, owing to heavy losses in the Great Chicago Fire, and on his return to Philadelphia, Montgomery was, in 1872, appointed general agent of the National Board of Underwriters, and the same year moved with his family to New York. This position he filled six years, and on his retirement, 1878, was the subject of complimentary testimonials to his good work in leading insurance journals, as well as of resolutions adopted by the National Board. In 1878 he accepted the position of manager of the department of perpetual insurance, in the Insurance Company of North America, Philadelphia. In 1880, he was elected vice-president of the American Fire Insurance Company, in the same city, and, 1882, became its president, which office he filled until his death. While residing in New York, Mr. Montgomery was a trustee of the Church of Holy Communion, and was active in founding several charitable societies. On his return to Philadelphia, 1879, he became a member of his ancestral parish, Christ Church, acting for many years as accounting warden, and worshiping at Christ Church chapel. He continued his historical studies and writings, and was a frequent attendant at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. In 1877 he prepared a monograph on the descendants of Thomas White, read at a reunion of the descendants held at ‚ÄúSophia‚Äôs Dairy,‚Äù on the Bush River, Maryland, June 7, 1877. In 1882, he purchased a country place near West Chester, Chester county, Pennsylvania, which he named Ardrossan, after one of the Montgomery family castles in Ayrshire, Scotland, and this became his home for twenty-three years. Montgomery was elected to the vestry of the Church of Holy Trinity, West Chester, Pennsylvania, and filled the position of rector‚Äôs warden there until his death. In 1885 he published a history of the Insurance Company of North America, the oldest insurance company in America.

He travelled very extensively in this country and Canada, and made three trips to Europe, 1887-89-91, each time visiting the ancient homes of his ancestors in Scotland. He spent the winters of 1903-4 and 1904-5 at his home in Philadelphiam and died there April 4, 1905. He was buried beside his parents at the Church of St. James the Less, Falls of Schuylkill. He was survived by his wife and all children. Montgomery held membership in the following organizations: The Protestant Episcopal Academy, of which he was for a time a trustee; the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, since 1866, of which he was a member of the publication committee from that date, and of its council since 1880; life member of the New York Historical Society; member of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society; the Ethnological Society of New York; the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania; one of the founders of the Society of Colonial Wars, and a member of its council since 1895; member of the Sons of the Revolution; of the Colonial Society of Pennsylvania; director of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. He was always active in charitable work, and was a man of deep religious feeling and faith. He was throughout his whole life one of the most vigorous supporters and members of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and wherever he was located he was public spirited, giving freely of interest and means. In 1901 he received from the University of Pennsylvania the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. Family Thomas and Anna Montgomery had five sons and four daughters. Their eldest son, James Alan, became a noted oriental scholar, and their third son Thomas Harrison Montgomery, Jr. became a noted biologist.

The Huns likely entered Europe shortly before 370 from Central Asia: they first conquered the Goths and the Alans, pushing a number of tribes to seek refuge within the Roman Empire. In the following years, the Huns conquered most of the Germanic and Scythian barbarian tribes outside of the borders of the Roman Empire. They also launched invasions of both the Asian provinces of Rome and the Sasanian Empire in 375. Under Uldin, the first Hunnic ruler named in contemporary sources, the Huns launched a first unsuccessful large-scale raid into the Eastern Roman Empire in Europe in 408. From the 420s, the Huns were led by the brothers Octar and Ruga, who both cooperated with and threatened the Romans. Upon Ruga's death in 435, his nephews Bleda and Attila became the new rulers of the Huns, and launched a successful raid into the Eastern Roman Empire before making peace and securing an annual tribute and trading raids under the Treaty of Margus. Attila appears to have killed his brother and became sole ruler of the Huns in 445. He would go on to rule for the next eight years, launching a devastating raid on the Eastern Roman Empire in 447, followed by an invasion of Gaul in 451. Attila is traditionally held to have been defeated in Gaul at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields, however some scholars hold the battle to have been a draw or Hunnic victory. The following year, the Huns invaded Italy and encountered no serious resistance before turning back. Hunnic dominion over Barbarian Europe is traditionally held to have collapsed suddenly after the death of Attila the year after the invasion of Italy. The Huns themselves are usually thought to have disappeared after the death of his son Dengizich in 469. However, some scholars have argued that the Bulgars in particular show a high degree of continuity with the Huns. Hyun Jin Kim has argued that the three major Germanic tribes to emerge from the Hunnic empire, the Gepids, the Ostrogoths, and the Scirii, were all heavily Hunnicized, and may have had Hunnic rather than native rulers even after the end of Hunnic dominion in Europe. It is possible that the Huns were directly or indirectly responsible for the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and they have been directly or indirectly linked to the dominance of Turkic tribes on the Eurasian steppe following the fourth century.  Potential history prior to 370  The 2nd century geographer Ptolemy mentioned a people called ŒßŒø·ø¶ŒΩŒøŒπ Khunnoi, when listing the peoples of the west Eurasian steppe. (In the Koine Greek used by Ptolemy, Œß generally denoted a voiceless velar fricative sound; hence contemporary Western Roman authors Latinised the name as Chuni or Chunni.) The Khunnoi lived \\"between the Bastarnae and the Roxolani\\", according to Ptolemy. However, modern scholars such as E. A. Thompson have claimed that the similarity of the ethnonyms Khunnoi and Hun were coincidental. Maenchen-Helfen and Denis Sinor also dispute the association of the Khunnoi with Attila's Huns. However, Maenchen-Helfen concedes that Ammianus Marcellinus referred to Ptolemy's report of the Khunnoi, when stating that the Huns were \\"mentioned only cursorily\\" by previous writers.Ammianus 32.2 A tribe called the ŒüœÖœÅŒøœÖŒ≥ŒøœçŒΩŒ¥ŒøŒπ Ourougo√∫ndoi (or Urugundi) who, according to Zosimus, invaded the Roman Empire from north of the Lower Danube in may have been synonymous with the ŒíŒøœÖœÅŒøœÖŒ≥ŒøœÖŒΩŒ¥ŒøŒπ Bourougoundoi, whom Agathias (6th century) listed among the Hunnish tribes. Other scholars have regarded both names as referring to a Germanic tribe, the Burgundi (Burgundians), although this identification was rejected by Maenchen-Helfen (who speculated that one or both names may have approximated an early Turkic ethnonym, such as \\"Vurugundi\\").  Early History   First conquests  A suggested path of the Huns' movement westwards (labels in German) The Huns' sudden appearance in the written sources suggests that the Huns crossed the Volga River from the east not much earlier. The reasons for the Huns' sudden attack on the neighboring peoples are unknown. One possible reason may have been climate change, however, Peter Heather notes that in the absence of reliable data this is unprovable. As a second possibility, Heather suggests some other nomadic group may have pushed them westward. Peter Golden suggests that the Huns may have been pushed west by the Jou-jan. A third possibility may have been a desire to increase their wealth by coming closer to the wealthy Roman Empire. The Romans became aware of the Huns when the latter's invasion of the Pontic steppes forced thousands of Goths to move to the Lower Danube to seek refuge in the Roman Empire in 376, according to the contemporaneous Ammianus Marcellinus. There are also some indications that the Huns were already raiding Transcaucasia in the 360s and 370s. These raids eventually forced the Eastern Roman Empire and Sasanian Empire to jointly defend the passes through the Caucasus mountains. Huns in battle with the Alans. An 1870s engraving after a drawing by Johann Nepomuk Geiger (1805‚Äì1880). The Huns first invaded the land of the Alans, which was located to the east of the Don River, defeating them and forcing the survivors to submit themselves to them or to flee across the Don. Maenchen-Helfen believes that rather than a direct conquest, the Huns instead allied themselves with groups of Alans. Writing much later, the historian Jordanes mentioned that the Huns also conquered \\"the Alpidzuri, the Alcildzuri, Itimari, Tuncarsi, and Boisci\\" in a battle by the Maeotian Swamp. These were potentially Turkic-speaking nomadic tribes who are later mentioned living under the Huns along the Danube. Jordanes claimed that the Huns at this time were led by a king Balamber. E. A. Thompson doubts that such a figure ever existed, but argues that \\"they were operating [...] with a much larger force than any one of their tribes could have put to the field\\". Hyun Jin Kim argues that Jordanes has invented Balamber on the basis of the 5th century figure Valamer. However, Maenchen-Helfen credits that Balamber was a historic king, and Denis Sinor suggests that \\"Balamber was merely the leader of a tribe or an ad hoc group of warriors\\". After they subjugated the Alans, the Huns and their Alan auxiliaries started plundering the wealthy settlements of the Greuthungi, or eastern Goths, to the west of the Don. Maenchen-Helfen suggests that it was as a result of their new alliance with these Alans that the Huns were able to threaten the Goths. The Greuthungic king, Ermanaric, resisted for a while, but finally \\"he found release from his fears by taking his own life\\", according to Ammianus Marcellinus. Marcellinus's report refers either to Ermanaric's suicide or to his ritual sacrifice. His great-nephew, Vithimiris, succeeded him. According to Ammianus, Vithimiris hired Huns to fight against the Alans who invaded the Greuthungi's land, but he was killed in a battle. Kim suggests that Ammianus has muddled events: the Alans, fleeing the Huns, likely attacked the Goths, who then called upon the Huns for aid. The Huns, having dealt with the Alans, \\"probably then in Machiavellian fashion fell upon the weakened Greuthungi Goths and conquered them as well\\". Hun warriors. Colored engraving from 1890. After Vithimiris's death, most Greuthungi submitted themselves to the Huns: they retained their own king, named Hunimund, whose name means \\"prot√©g√© of the Huns\\". Those who decided to resist marched to the Dniester River which was the border between the lands of the Greuthungi and the Thervingi, or western Goths. They were under the command of Alatheus and Saphrax, because Vithimiris's son, Viderichus, was a child. Athanaric, the leader of the Thervingi, met the refugees along the Dniester at the head of his troops. However, a Hun army bypassed the Goths and attacked them from the rear, forcing Athanaric to retreat towards the Carpathian Mountains. Athanaric wanted to fortify the borders, but Hun raids into the land west of the Dniester continued. Most Thervingi realized that they could not resist the Huns. They went to the Lower Danube, requesting asylum in the Roman Empire. The still resisting Greuthingi under the leadership of Alatheus and Saphrax also marched to the river. Most Roman troops had been transferred from the Balkan Peninsula to fight against the Sassanid Empire in Armenia. Emperor Valens permitted the Thervingi to cross the Lower Danube and to settle in the Roman Empire in the autumn of 376. The Thervingi were followed by the Greuthingi, and also by the Taifali and \\"other tribes that formerly dwelt with the Goths and Taifali\\" to the north of the Lower Danube, according to Zosimus. Food shortage and abuse stirred the Goths to revolt in early 377. The ensuing war between the Goths and the Romans lasted for more than five years. The Barbarian invasions of the 5th century were triggered by the destruction of the Gothic kingdoms by the Huns in 372‚Äì375. The city of Rome was captured and looted by the Visigoths in 410 and by the Vandals in 455.  First encounters with Rome  During the Gothic War, the Goths appear to have allied with a group of Huns and Alans, who crossed the Danube and forced the Romans to allow the Goths to advance further into Thrace. The Huns are mentioned intermittently among their allies until 380, after which they apparently returned beyond the Danube. Additionally, in 381, the Scirii and Carpi, together with at least some Huns, launched an unsuccessful attack upon Pannonia. Once Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius I made peace with the Goths in 382, the historian Eunapius claims that he gave them land and cattle in order to form \\"an unconquerable bulwark against the inroads of the Huns.\\" After this, the Huns are recorded to have launched a raid into Scythia Minor in 384 or 385. Soon afterwards, in 386, a group of Greuthungi under Odotheus fled the Huns into Thrace, followed by several attempts by the Sarmatians. This is the last serious migration into Roman territory until after the end of Hun rule, and Kim suggests that this indicates that the Huns were securely in control of the tribes beyond Rome at this time. Otto Maenchen-Helfen and E. A. Thompson argue that the Huns appear to have already been in possession of large parts of Pannonia (the Hungarian plain) as early as 384. Denis Sinor suggests that they may have been settled there are foederati of the Romans rather than as invaders, dating their presence to 380. In 384, the Roman-Frankish general Flavius Bauto employed Hunnic mercenaries to defeat the Juthungi tribe attacking from Rhaetia. However, the Huns, rather than return to their own country, began to ride to Gaul: Bauto was forced to bribe them to turn back. They then attacked the Alamanni. Pacatus Drepanius reports that the Huns then fought with Theodosius against the usurper Magnus Maximus in 388. In 392, however, the Huns were again involved in raids in the Balkans, together with various other tribes. Some of the Huns seem to have settled in Thrace, and these Huns were then used as auxiliaries by Theodosius in 394; Maenchen-Helfen argues that the Romans may have hoped to use the Huns against the Goths. Kim believes that these mercenaries were not really Huns, but rather non-Hunnic groups capitalizing on the Huns' fearsome reputation as warriors. These Huns were eventually wiped up by the Romans in 401 after they began plundering the territory.  First large scale attack on Rome and Persia  In 395 the Huns began their first large-scale attacks on the Romans. In the summer of that year, the Huns crossed over the Caucasus Mountains, while in the winter of 395, another Hunnic invasion force crossed the frozen Danube, pillaged Thrace, and threatened Dalmatia. Sinor argues that these two events were likely not coordinated, but Kim believes they were. The forces in Asia invaded Armenia, Persia, and the Roman provinces in Asia. One group crossed the Euphrates and was defeated by a Roman army, while two armies, recorded in later sources as under the leadership of Basich and Kursich, rode down the Euphrates and threatened the Persian capital of Ctesiphon. One of these armies was defeated by the Persians, while the other successfully retreated by Derbend Pass. A final group of Huns ravaged Asia Minor. The Huns devastated parts of Syria and Cappadocia, threatening Antioch. The devastation was worse because most Roman forces had been moved to the West due to Roman power struggles there. In 398 Eutropius finally succeeded in gathering an army and restoring order in the province. It seems likely, however, that the Huns left of their own accord without Eutropius having defeated them in battle. Sinor argues that the much larger scale of the attacks on Asia Minor and Persia indicates that the bulk of the Huns had remained on the Pontic steppes rather than moving into Europe at this time. It seems clear that the Huns did not intend to conquer or settle the territories they attacked, but rather to plunder the provinces, taking, among other things, cattle. Priscus, writing much later, reports hearing from the Huns at Attila's camp that the raid was launched due to a famine on the steppes. This may also have been the reason for the raids into Thrace. Maenchen-Helfen suggests that Basich and Kursich, the Hun leaders responsible for the invasion of Persia, may have come to Rome in 404 or 407 as mercenaries: Priscus records that they came to Rome to make an alliance. Hunnic attacks against Armenia would continue after this raid, with Armenian sources noting a Hunnic tribe known as the Xailandur as the perpetrators.  Uldin  Campaigns of Uldin. Uldin, the first Hun identified by name in contemporary sources, is identified as the leader of the Huns in Muntenia (modern Romania east of the Olt River) in 400. It is unclear how much territory or how many tribes of Huns Uldin actually controlled, although he clearly controlled parts of Hungary as well as Muntenia. The Romans referred to him as a regulus (sub-king): he himself boasted of immense power. In 400, Gainas, rebellious former Roman magister militum fled into Uldin's territory with an army of Goths, and Uldin defeated and killed him, likely near Novae: he sent Gainas's head to Constantinople. Kim suggests that Uldin was interested in cooperating with the Romans while he expanded his control over Germanic tribes in the West. In 406, Hunnic pressure seems to have caused groups of Vandals, Suebi, and Alans to cross the Rhine into Gaul. Uldin's Huns raided Thrace in 404‚Äì405, likely in winter. Also in 405, a group of Goths under Radagaisus invaded Italy, with Kim arguing that these Goths originated from Uldin's territory and that they were likely fleeing from some action of his. Stilicho, the Roman magister militum responded by asking for Uldin's aid: Uldin's Huns then destroyed Radagaisus's army near Faesulae in modern Tuscany in 406. Kim suggests Uldin acted in order to demonstrate his ability to destroy any groups of barbarians who might flee Hunnic rule. An army of 1000 of Uldin's Huns were also employed by the Eastern Roman Empire to fight against the Goths under Alaric. After Stilicho's death in 408, however, Uldin switched sides and began aiding Alaric under an army under the command of Alaric's brother-in-law Athaulf. Also in 408, the Huns, under Uldin's command, crossed the Danube and captured the important fortress Castra Martis in Moesia. The Roman commander in Thrace attempted to make peace with Uldin, but Uldin refused his offers and demanded an extremely high tribute. However, many of Uldin's commanders subsequently defected to the Romans, bribed by the Romans. It appears that most of his army was actually composed by Scirii and Germanic tribes, whom the Romans subsequently sold into slavery. Uldin himself escaped back across the Danube, after which he is not mentioned again. The Romans responded to Uldin's invasions by attempting to strengthen the fortifications at the border, increasing the defenses at Constantinople, and taking other measures to strengthen their defences. Hunnic mercenaries had also formed Stilicho's bodyguard: Kim suggests they were a gift from Uldin. The guard was either killed with Stilicho, or is the same as an elite unit of 300 Huns who continued to fight for the Romans against Alaric even after Uldin's invasion. During this same time, probably between 405 and 408, the future Roman magister militum and opponent of Attila Flavius Aetius was a hostage living among the Huns.  410s  Sources on the Huns after Uldin are scarce. In 412 or 413, the Roman statesman and writer Olympiodorus of Thebes was sent on an embassy to \\"the first of the kings\\" of the Huns, Charaton. Olympiodorus wrote an account of this event, which exists now only fragmentarily. Olympiodorus had been dispatched to appease Charaton after the death of a certain Donatus, who \\"was unlawfully put to death\\". Historians such as E. A. Thompson have assumed that Donatus was a king of the Huns. Denis Sinor, however, argues that given his obviously Roman name Donatus was likely a Roman refugee living among the Huns. Where Olympiodorus met Charaton is also unclear: due to Olympiodorus's traveling by sea, they may have met somewhere on the Pontic steppe. Maenchen-Helfen and Sinor, however, believe it more likely that Charaton was located in Pannonia. Also in 412, the Huns launched a new raid into Thrace.  Period of unified Hunnic rule   Ruga and Octar  The Huns again raided in 422, apparently under the command of a leader named Ruga. They reached as far as the walls of Constantinople. They appear to have forced the Eastern Empire to pay an annual tribute. In 424, they are noted as fighting for the Romans in North Africa, indicating friendly relations with the Western Roman Empire. In 425, magister militum Aetius marched into Italy with a large army of Huns to fight against forces of the Eastern Empire. The campaign ended with reconciliation, and the Huns received gold and returned to their lands. In 427, however, the Romans broke their alliance with the Huns and attacked Pannonia, perhaps reconquerring part of it. It is unclear when Ruga and his brother Octar became the supreme rulers of the Huns: Ruga appears to have ruled the land East of the Carpathians while Octar ruled the territory to the north and west of the Carpathians. Kim argues that Octar was a \\"deputy\\" king in his territory while Ruga was the supreme king. Octar died around 430 while fighting the Burgundians, who at the time lived on the right bank of the Rhine. Denis Sinor argues that his nephew Attila likely succeeded him as ruler of the eastern portion of the Huns' empire in this year. Maenchen-Helfen, however, argues that Ruga simply became sole ruler. In 432, Ruga aided Aetius, who had fallen into disfavor, in reobtaining his old office of magister militum: Ruga either sent or threatened to send an army into Italy. In 433, Aetius surrendered Pannonia Prima to Ruga, perhaps as a reward for aid that Ruga's Huns had given him in securing his position. Either the previous year, in 432, or 434, Ruga sent an emissary to Constantinople announcing that he intended to attack some tribes whom he considered under his authority but who had fled into Roman territory; however, he died after the beginning of this campaign and the Huns left Roman territory.  Under Attila and Bleda  A nineteenth century depiction of Attila. Certosa di Pavia ‚Äì Medallion at the base of the facade. The Latin inscription tells that this is Attila, the scourge of God. After Ruga's death, his nephews Attila and Bleda became the rulers of the Huns: Bleda appears to have ruled in the eastern portion of the empire, while Attila ruled the west. Kim believes that Bleda was the supreme king of the two. In 435, Bleda and Attila forced the Eastern Roman Empire to sign the Treaty of Margus, giving the Huns trade rights and increasing the annual tribute from the Romans. The Romans also agreed to hand over Hunnic refugees and fugitive tribes. Ruga appears to have made a commitment to aid Aetius in Gaul before his death, and Attila and Bleda kept this commitment. In 437, Huns, under the direction of Aetius and possibly with the involvement of Attila, destroyed the Burgundian kingdom on the Rhine under king Gundahar, an event memorialized in medieval Germanic legend. It is possible that the Huns' destruction of the Burgundians was motivated by revenge for the death of Octar in 430. Also in 437, the Huns helped Aetius capture Tibatto, the leader of the Bagaudae, a group of rebellious peasants and slaves. In 438, an army of Huns aided the Roman general Litorius in an unsuccessful siege of the Visigothic capital of Toulouse. Priscus also mentions that the Huns extended their rule in \\"Scythia\\" and fought against an otherwise unknown people called the Sorosgi. In 440, the Huns attacked the Romans during one of the annual trading fairs stipulated by the Treaty of Margus: the Huns justified this action by alleging that the bishop of Margus had crossed into Hunnic territory and plundered the Hunnic royal tombs and that the Romans themselves had breached the treaty by sheltering refugees from the Hunnic empire. When the Romans failed to turn over either the bishop of Margus or the refugees by 441, the Huns sacked a number of towns and captured the city of Viminacium, razing it to the ground. The bishop of Margus, terrified that he would be handed over to the Huns, made a deal to betray the city to the Huns, which was likewise razed. The Huns also captured the fortress of Constantia on the Danube, as well as capturing and razing the cities of Singidunum and Sirmium. After this the Huns agreed to a truce. Maenchen-Helfen supposes that their army may have been hit by a disease, or that a rival tribe may have attacked Hunnic territory, necessitating a withdrawal. Thompson dates a further large campaign against the Eastern Roman Empire to 443; however Maenchen-Helfen, Kim, and Heather date it to around 447, after Attila had become sole ruler of the Huns. In 444, tensions rose between the Huns and the Western Empire, and the Romans made preparations for war; however, the tensions appear to have resolved the following year through the diplomacy of Cassiodorus. The terms seem to have involved the Romans handing over some territory to the Huns on the Sava River and may also have been when Attila was made magister militum to draw a salary.  Unified rule under Attila  A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic Empire under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow. Bleda died some time between 442 and 447, with the most likely years being 444 or 445. He appears to have been murdered by Attila. Following Bleda's death, a tribe known as the Akatziri either rebelled against Attila or had never been under Attila's rule. Kim suggests that they rebelled specifically because of Bleda's death, as they were more likely to have been under Bleda's control than Attila's. The rebellion was actively encouraged by the Romans, who sent gifts to the Akatziri; however, the Romans offended the supreme chief, Buridach, by giving him gifts second rather than first. He subsequently appealed to Attila for help against the other rebellious leaders. Attila's forces then defeated the tribe after several battles: Buridach was allowed to rule his own tribe, but Attila placed his son Ellac in command of the remaining Akatziri. Maenchen-Helfen argues that the Huns likely fought a war against the Longobards, living in modern Moravia, in 446, in which the Longobards successfully resisted Hunnic domination. Some time after Bleda's death, while the Huns were busy with internal affairs, the Theodosius had ceased paying the stipulated tribute to the Huns. In 447, Attila sent an embassy to complain, threatening war and noting that his people were dissatisfied and that some had even begun raiding Roman territory. The Romans, however, refused to resume the tribute payments or hand over any refugees, and Attila began a full-scale attack by capturing the forts along the Danube. His forces included not only Huns, but also his subject peoples the Gepids, led by their king Ardaric, and the Goths under their king Valamer, as well as others. After they had cleared the Danube of Roman defences, the Huns then marched westward and defeated a large Roman army under the command of Arnegisclus at the Battle of the Utus. The Huns then sacked and razed Marcianople. The Huns then set out for Constantinople itself, whose walls had been partially destroyed by an earthquake earlier in the year. While the Constantinoplitans were able to rebuild the walls before Attila's army was able to approach, the Romans suffered another major defeat on the Gallipoli peninsula. The Huns proceeded to raid as far south as Thermopylae and captured most of the major towns in the Balkans except for Hadrianople and Heracleia. Theodosius was forced to sue for peace: in addition to the tribute the Romans had failed to pay before, the amount of yearly tribute was raised, and the Romans were forced to evacuate a large swath of territory south of the Danube to the Huns, thus leaving the border defenseless. In 450, Attila negotiated a new treaty with the Romans and agreed to withdraw from Roman lands; Heather believes that this was in order for him to plan an invasion of the Western Roman Empire. According to Priscus, Attila contemplated an invasion of Persia at this time as well. The treaty with Constantinople was abrogated shortly afterward by the new emperor Marcian, however, Attila was already occupied with his plans for the Western Empire and did not respond.  Invasion of Gaul  Attila in Gaul, 451 CE. In spring of 451, Attila invaded Gaul. Relations with the Western Roman Empire appear to have deteriorated already by 449. One of the leaders of the Bagaudae, Eudoxius, had also fled to the Huns in 448. Aetius and Attila had also backed different candidates to be king of the Ripuarian Franks in 450. Attila claimed to the East Roman ambassadors in 450 that he intended to attack the Visigoths at Toulouse as an ally of the Western Emperor Valentinian III. According to one source, Honoria, the sister of Valentinian III, sent Attila a ring and asked for his aid in escaping imprisonment at the hands of her brother. Attila then demanded half of Western Roman territory as his dowry and invaded. Kim dismisses this story as of doubtful authenticity and a \\"ridiculous stor[y]\\". Heather is similarly skeptical that Attila would invade for this reason, noting that Attila invaded Gaul while Honoria was in Italy. Jordanes claims that Geiseric, king of the Vandals in North Africa, encouraged Attila to attack. Thompson suggests that Attila intended to remove Aetius and actually take up his honorary office as magister militum. Kim believes that it is unlikely that Attila actually intended to conquer Gaul, but rather to secure his control over Germanic tribes living on the Rhine. The Hunnic army set out from the Hungarian Plain and likely crossed the Rhine near Koblenz. The Hunnic army included, besides Huns, the Gepids, Rugii, Sciri, Thuringi, Ostrogoths. Thompson suggests that Attila's first objection was the Ripuarian Franks, whom he summarily conquered and drafted into his army. They then captured Metz and Trier, before heading to besiege Orl√©ans, with another detachment unsuccessfully attacking Paris. The approach of Aetius' army, consisting of Romans and allies such as the Visigoths under their king Theodoric I, Burgundians, the Alans, and some Franks, forced the Huns to break the siege of Orl√©ans. Somewhere near Troyes, the two armies met and fought in the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields. In the standard scholarly view of the battle, despite the death of Theodoric, Attila's army was defeated and forced to retreat from Gaul. Kim argues that the battle was actually a Hunnic victory: the Huns had already been leaving Gaul after a successful campaign and simply continued to do so after the battle.  Invasion of Italy  Raphael's The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila depicts Pope Leo I, escorted by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, meeting with the Hun emperor outside Rome Upon his return to Pannonia, Attila ordered the launching of raids into Illyricum to encourage the Eastern Roman Empire to resume its tribute. Rather than attacking the Eastern Empire, however, in 452 he invaded Italy. The precise reasons for this are unclear: the Chronicle of 452 claims that it was due to his anger at his defeat in Gaul the previous year. The Huns crossed the Julian Alps and then besieged the heavily defended city of Aquileia, eventually capturing and razing it after a long siege. They then entered the Po Valley, sacking Padua, Mantua, Vicentia, Verona, Brescia, and Bergamo, before besieging and capturing Milan. The Huns made no attempt to capture Ravenna, and were either stopped or did not try to take Rome. Aetius was unable to offer an meaningful resistance and his authority was greatly damaged. The Huns received a peace embassy led by Pope Leo I and in the end turned back. However, Heather argues that it was a combination of disease and an attack by Eastern Roman troops on the Hunnic homeland in Pannonia that led to the Huns' withdrawal. Kim argues that the attacks by the Eastern Romans are a fiction, as the Eastern Empire was in a worse state than the West. Kim believes that the campaign had been a success and that the Huns simply withdrew after acquiring enough booty to satisfy them.  After Attila   Disintegration of Hunnic rule in the West  \\"The Death of Attila\\" by Ferenc Paczka. In 453, Attila was reportedly planning a major campaign against the Eastern Romans to force them to resume paying tribute. However, he died unexpectedly, reportedly of a hemorrhage during his wedding to a new bride. He may also have been planning an invasion of the Sasanian Empire; Martin Schottky claims that \\"Attila‚Äôs death in 453 C.E. saved the Sasanians from an armed encounter with the Huns while they were at the height of their military power\\". Peter Heather, however, finds it unlikely that the Huns would have actually attacked Persia. According to Jordanes, Attila's death precipitated a power struggle between his sons ‚Äì it is unknown how many there were in total, but ancient sources mention three by name: Ellac, Dengizich and Ernak. The brothers began fighting one another, and this caused the Gepids under Ardaric to rebel. The Huns under Ellac then fought the Gepids and were defeated, resulting in Ellac's death. According to Jordanes, this occurred at the Battle of Nedao in 454, however, Heather speculates that there may have been more than just a single battle. Some tribes, such as the Scirii, fought on the Huns' side against the Gepids. He also notes that, while 454 may have been a significant turning point, it by no means ended Hunnic rule over most of their subject peoples. According to Heather, rather than an immediate collapse, the end of Hunnic rule was a slow process whereby the Huns gradually lost control over their subject peoples. The Huns continued to exist under Attila's sons Dengizich and Ernak. Kim argues that Dengizich had successfully reestablished Hunnic rule over the western part of their empire in 464. In 466, Dengizich demanded that Constantinople resume paying tribute to the Huns and reestablish of the Huns' trading rights with the Romans. The Romans refused, however. Dengizich then decided to invade the Roman empire, with Ernak declining to join him to focus on other wars. Kim suggests that Ernak was distracted by the invasion of the Saragurs and other Oghurs, who had defeated the Akatziri in 463. Without his brother, Dengizich was forced to rely on the recently conquered Ostrogoths and the \\"unreliable\\" Bittigur tribe. His forces also included the Hunnic tribes of the Ultzinzures, Angiscires, and Bardores. The Romans were able to encourage the Goths in his army to revolt, forcing Dengizich to retreat. He died in 469, with Kim believing he was murdered, and his head was sent to the Romans. Anagastes, the son of Arnegisclus who was slain by Attila, brought Dengzich's head to Constantinople and paraded it through the streets before mounting it on a stake in the Hippodrome. This was the end of Hunnic rule in the West.  Germanic tribes as successors to the Huns in the West  Kim argues that the war after the death of Attila was actually a rebellion of the western half of the Hunnic empire, led by Ardaric, against the eastern half, led by Ellac as leader of the Akatziri Huns. He further argues that Ardaric, in common with the other leaders of the Gepids, was actually a Hun and not of Germanic origin; he notes that bones from the Gepid period frequently show Asiatic features among the ruling elite. He also notes that Gepid rule in the Carpathian Basin appears to have differed little from that of the Huns. Ardaric's grandson Mundo is identified in sources both as a Hun and as a Gepid. Kim explains the fact that Ardaric's kingdom was identified as a Gepid rather than a Hunnic kingdom from the fact that the western part of the Hunnic empire had been almost entirely Germanic in population. The Scirii also emerged from Attila's empire with a potentially Hunnic King: Edeko is first encountered in sources as Attila's envoy, and is variously identified as having a Hunnic or Thuringian mother. While Heather believes that the latter is more likely, Kim argues that Edeco was in fact a Hun and that Thuringian in the source is a mistake for Torcilingi. Accordingly, his sons Hunoulph (\\"Hun-wolf\\") and Odoacer, who would go on to conquer Italy, would also be Huns ethnically, though the armies they led were certainly mostly Germanic. Odoacer would also conquer the Rogii, a tribe typically identified with the Rugii found in Tacitus' Germania, but whom Kim holds far more likely to be a newly formed tribe that was named after the Hunnic king Ruga. The Goths led by the Amali dynasty under their king Valamir also became independent some time after 454. This did not include all Goths, however, some of whom are recorded as continuing to fight with the Huns as late as 468. Kim argues that even the Amali-led Goths remained loyal to the Huns until 459, when Valamir's nephew Theoderic was sent as a hostage to Constantinople, or even 461, when Valimir made an alliance with the Romans. Heather argues that the Amali united various groups of Goths sometime after Attila's death, though Jordanes claims that he did it while Attila was still alive. As he has for Ardaric and Ediko, Kim argues that Valimir, who is first attested as a confidant of Attila, was actually a Hun. Around 464, Valamir's Goths fought the Scirii, resulting in Valamir's death ‚Äì this in turn caused the Goths to virtually destroy the Scirii. Dengizich then intervened ‚Äì Kim supposes that the Scirii appealed to him for help, and that they together defeated the Goths. In a battle dated by Jordanes to 465, but by Kim to 470 after the death of Dengizich, the Scirii led an alliance of various tribes, including the Suebi, Rogii, Gepids, and Sarmatians against the Goths at the Battle of Bolia. The Gothic victory confirmed their independence and the end of Hunnic rule in the West. Therefore, despite the collapse of the Western Hunnic Empire, Kim argues that the most important Barbarian leaders in Europe after Attila were all themselves Huns or were closely associated with Attila's empire.  Potential continuation of Hunnic rule in the East  It is unclear what happened to Attila's youngest son Ernak. Heather states that Ernak and a group of Huns were settled, with Roman permission, in northern Dobruja. Maenchen-Helfen notes that Ernak seems to have left this territory at some time before Dengizich's invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire. The rulers of the Bulgars, a Turkic nomadic people who first appear in historical sources around 480, may have claimed to be descended from Attila via Ernak, as recorded in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans. Kim and Denis Sinor argue that Ernak combined the remaining Huns with new Oghur-speaking Turkic tribes that had been pushed east from the steppe to form the Bulgars. Kim also argues that the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, often considered a separate people, were in fact simply part of the Hunno-Bulgar state. While many scholars dismiss medieval sources that refer to people after Dengizich's demise as Huns, Kim argues that these designations accurately describe the identity of the people in question, at least during the sixth century. Ancient sources appear to indicate that not all Hunnic peoples were incorporated into Ernak's Bulgar state. Huns continue to appear as mercenaries and allies of both the Persians and Romans in the sixth century as well. The Hunnic Altziagiri tribes continued to inhabit the Crimea near Cherson. Jordanes mentions two groups descended from Dengizich's Huns living on Roman territory, the Fossatisii and Sacromontisi. Kim, however, argues that we can distinguish just four large tribal groupings of Huns after the death of Dengizich; he argues that these were likely all ruled by members of Attila's dynasty. These groups often fought each other, however, and Kim argues that this allowed the Avars to conquer them and \\"recreat[e] the old Hunnic Empire in its entirety\\". He argues that Avars themselves had Hunnic, but not European Hunnic, elements prior to their invasion. The tribe of Sabirs is sometimes identified in Byzantine sources as Huns, and Denis Sinor argues that they may have contained some Hunnic elements as well. Kim, however, identifies them with the Xianbei. A final possible survival of the Huns are the North Caucasian Huns, who lived in what is now Dagestan. It is unclear whether these Huns were ever under Attila's rule. Kim argues that they are a group of Huns who were separated from the main confederation by the intruding Sabirs. In 503 they raided Persia, and they are recorded raiding Armenia, Cappadocia, and Lycaonia in 515. The Romans hired mercenaries from this group, including a king named Askoum. At some point, the North Caucasian Huns became a vassal state of the Khazar Khaganate. They are recorded to have converted to Christianity in 681. The North Caucasian Huns are last attested in the seventh century, but Kim argues that they may have persisted within the Khazar empire.  Historical impact  Peter Golden argues that the Huns, and the migrations that are associated with them, resulted in the transformation of the Western Eurasian steppe from the territory of primarily Iranian-speaking nomads to Turkic- speaking ones, as Turkic speakers moved west from modern Mongolia. Within Europe, the Huns are typically held responsible for the beginning of the Migration period, in which mostly Germanic tribes increasingly moved into the space of the late Roman Empire. Peter Heather has argued that Huns were thereby responsible for the eventual disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, while E. A. Thompson argued that the Huns accelerated Germanic incursions both before and after their own presence on the Roman frontier. Walter Pohl, meanwhile notes that \\"[w]hat the Huns had achieved was a massive transfer of resources from the Roman empire to the barbaricum\\". Due to his differing opinions on the organization of the Huns, Hyun Jin Kim argues that, rather than by causing migrations of Germanic peoples, the Huns were responsible for the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the force of their armies and their efficient imperial administration, leading to a collapse of the Roman military. Other scholars have seen the Huns as less important in the end of Rome. J. Otto Maenchen-Helfen described the Hun's under Attila as \\"for a few years more than a nuisance to the Romans, though at no time a real danger\\". Other scholars such as J. B. Bury have in fact argued that the Huns held the Germanic tribes back and thus gave the empire a few more years of life.

It broadcasts a mixture of music, information, news, sports, culture, events coverage and lifestyle features. The station was the first commercial full-time New Zealand radio station targeting migrant communities. According to the 2014 TNS New Zealand radio survey, it remains the highest-rating ethnic broadcaster in the country. Robert Khan set up the station in 1996 for Auckland's Indian and Hindi-speaking community. It now targets a broad range of Indian, Pakistani, Bangaladeshi, Sri Lankan and Fijian migrants around New Zealand. The network aims to foster mutual understanding between different migrant groups with diverse interests, religions and ethnic origins. This is done in part through the coverage of religious festivals, international news events and local political issues. Tarana broadcasts in Auckland on 1386 AM, reaching a weekly audience of 32,000 in the Auckland market during a survey in 2014. Radio agency The Radio Bureau claims these listeners have \\"significant spending capacity\\" and \\"high disposable incomes\\". With nationwide coverage through online streaming, digital radio, mobile devices, satellite radio and an estimated 22,000 weekly web browsers, it claims to reach a total audience based on about 80,000. History In 2014 more than 400,000 people attended events organised by Radio Tarana, including its annual Diwali festival. Tarana began broadcasting on 15 June 1996 at 5.00pm, to showcase popular Hindi songs from the 1950s to now, including Bollywood music, popular tracks and new remixes. This includes live music and local music tracks. Other programmes include local news and sports bulletins, interviews, and discussions on local contributors covering issues affecting local migrant communities. Tarana has supported community events and activities, and provided on-air event listings, birthday announcements, and death notices. It has sponsored the Indian Republic Day Show, Festival of India, Diwali Mela, India Independence Day Show, and similar events. The events it organised around the country in 2014 attracted more than 400,000 people. With a broad range of programming blocks, the station has tried to reach a range of age groups, social backgrounds and other segments of the audience. Language use Radio Tarana broadcasts in a combination of Hindi and New Zealand English. It was set up specifically to promote the Hindi language and serve Hindi-speaking communities. Many of its hosts are proficient in the Hindi language, experts in language usage, or advocates for its continued use in New Zealand. Some of the hosts have worked for overseas media outlets like Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, Radio Fiji, Radio Navtarang, Radio Sargam, Mirchi FM and the BBC. Many are prominent community figures or have been master of ceremonies at local community events. Journalist and media commentator Thakur Ranjit Singh, the former publisher of Fiji Daily Post, has been critical of Radio Tarana's extensive use of Hindi. In 2012, he wrote Tarana had used and promoted a high quality of traditional Hindi, maintaining language decorum, sensitivity and proper usage. He suggested rival network Apna had used pidgin, slang and Fiji Hindi, and had compromised the language with \\"linguistic engineering\\". However, Singh claimed Tarana was not translating words into New Zealand English or explaining words in ways young and second generation listeners could understand. He argued this excluded listeners who had limited exposure to the Hindi language, including school children whose friends and peers were mostly Pakeha. He suggest this could undermine Tarana's efforts to promote the Hindi language. Religious complaints Radio Tarana has been the subject of Broadcasting Standards Authority complaints relating to its coverage of religious issues. The first related to a series about religious procedures following the death of a Muslim person. A Muslim priest argued the dates and times of making supplications did not need to be fixed, and a Muslim commentator they did. The host argued the priest was right, and was accused of being unfair and derogatory to the Muslim commentator. Radio Tarana disputed the claim, accusing the commentator of being derogatory towards the priest, and said the programme was no longer on air. The broadcaster was unable to provide tapes of the programme, and the authority found it could not determine the case. It asked Tarana to keep recordings of future programmes. Another complaint related to Zinadgi Forever, a Christian radio programme produced by Navjaveen Ministries International and broadcast on Radio Tarana. The programme's host had discussed his conversion from Hinduism to Christianity on air, saying after he received a Bible he \\"never walked in darkness again\\" and \\"never walked in untruth again\\". He was accused of discriminating against and denigrating the Hindu religion and breaching responsible programme standards in 2009. However, the authority ruled the host was entitled to discuss his personal views and experiences with Christianity, and the programme did not encourage denigration or discrimination against Hindu people. News Radio Tarana has covered national and international news events, including New Zealand elections, 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat, 2001 Indian Parliament attack 2001 Gujarat earthquake, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat and 2014 Fijian general election. Its journalists and hosts have interviewed politicians and journalists, like US Senator John McCain, New Zealand prime minister John Key, and United Nations Development Programme administrator Helen Clark. Winston Peters and Phil Goff have also done interviews with Tarana. The station provides coverage of cricket, soccer and rugby. Its website also includes live feeds from stuff.co.nz, Times of India, Fiji Times, Cricket Next, Bollywood Hungama and BBC News. Tarana broadcasts BBC News Hindi, BBC News Urdu and Fiji News every weekday afternoon, and broadcasts BBC News Hindi every evening of the week. Fiji coverage Radio Tarana covers Fijian news, political issues and events including the 2000 and 2006 coups and the 2014 general election. It is the only media outlet in the world to secure a weekly interview with Fijian prime minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama. Journalist Sanjesh Narayan has conducted the phone interview since Bainimarama took power. In 2011, he said it was often hard to secure the prime minister at a specific allotted time, but Bainimarama always took part. At the end of a two-hour interview at his Suva office, Bainimarama said Tarana served as a \\"good bridge between Fiji and New Zealand\\" and Narayan was a \\"pleasant man\\" he had never met. Complaints In 2014, the Broadcasting Standards Authority refused to uphold complaint against Radio Tarana from Fiji government minister Rajesh Singh. Tarana had broadcast a news item about District Court proceedings involving Singh, over a dispute about rent allegedly owned to the landlord of a building he leased. Singh argued the story was an unfair, inaccurate and unbalanced account of a controversial issue. He also believed the story was discriminatory, was denigration, and went against good taste and decency. However, the authority found the story was a straightforward, brief news report, and gave proper airtime to the complainant's position. Later the same year, the authority received a complaint about Tarana's stories on the Sanil Kumar Medical Fund, which had been set up the support the treatment of a young Fijian-Indian man in New Zealand who had died after being deported back to Fiji. Radio Tarana News reported some people, including the immediate family of Kumar, had made allegations the fund was being misused by its directors. The complainants, Pradeep Chand, Asheelta Kumar, Ashok Kumar and Kamta Prasad, argued the reporting, was unbalanced, inaccurate, unfair, denigrating, and likely to cause panic among the public. The authority rejected the claims, ruling the broadcaster made been reasonably balanced, fair and accurate, and the story was no discriminatory or irresponsible.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority received a complaint about the Tarana Drive in 2012, over a Hindi language talkback segment Drive Time Chit Chat dedicated to \\"promiscuity\\". The host asked listeners to give their opinions on whether men or women were more flirty. He accessed the Facebook account of a woman who had left her account open on his phone, and read out her private conversations with a Fijian man. The woman said her Facebook profile had been accessed without permission, and the reading of her Facebook messages on air was a breach of her privacy. She also raised concerns about another episode of the programme two days later. The authority ruled she was not \\"identifiable beyond family and close friends\\" who would already know about the issue. However, the authority criticised the host for broadcasting content from social media without considering how he had found it, what he read out, and the way he was broadcasting it.

In a statement, the company said the Indian community was one of the fastest growing ethnic communities in New Zealand, with a population over 180,000. It also claimed Radio Tarana was \\"the most trusted source of information\\" to the community, with an engaged and loyal audience. The live stream will make Tarana's Bollywood entertainment, news, sports, music and talkback available nationwide. Tarana managing director Robert Khan said it would add to Radio Tarana's leadership in social media, which reaches 261,000 people and engages 10,000 people each week. MediaWorks partnership In January 2015 Radio Tarana and MediaWorks New Zealand announced a partnership to collaborate commercially, extending the reach and client opportunities for both broadcasters. Khan said the arrangement protected the station's unique identity as an independent Indian community. The station would continue to have editorial control over its news, music, information, sports, culture, events and lifestyle programmes. The partnership provided the opportunity to be part of the MediaWorks staple which included TV3, TV4, George FM, Mai FM, Magic, More FM, Radio Live, The Breeze, The Edge, The Rock and The Sound. MediaWorks commercial director Paul Hancox said the partnership would allow the company to take its brands and personalities into Tarana's markets, which would have otherwise been hard to reach. Writer Damien Venuto said the partnership made sense given the increase in new migrants to New Zealand since 1996, and the growing divide between broadcasters that are dedicated to ethnic minorities and those that are targeting a broad audience. Khan claimed the station's listenership was growing rapidly, with Hindi becoming the fourth most spoke language in the country and Indian becoming the fifth largest ethnic group. He said the radio market was rapidly changing, audiences were becoming more fragmented, and major radio companies were starting to recognise the value of commercially successful niche broadcasters with a loyal client base. He said major broadcasters were struggling to maintain listeners for long periods of time on tradition platforms, while niche broadcasters were struggling to find free-to- air spectrum.

Gherea (Francized J. D. Gh√©r√©a; 1895 ‚Äì November 5, 1978), was a Romanian philosopher, essayist, and concert pianist. The son of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a Marxist theoretician and critic, and the brother of communist militant Alexandru \\"Sa»ôa\\" Gherea, he discarded their political and literary influence, being more interested in the aestheticism of his brother-in-law, Paul Zarifopol. As a youth, Zarifopol took him to meet playwright Ion Luca Caragiale and his family. Gherea's debut as a writer was a 1920 novel written jointly with Luca Caragiale, which was also his only contribution to the genre. Enjoying national success as an accompanist for George Enescu, Gherea was also a respected literary essayist, and a noted Romanian phenomenologist, ontologist, and philosopher of art; his lasting friendship with philosopher Constantin Noica transcended ethnic and ideological barriers. An anti-authoritarian, Gherea was repressed by during the first decade of Romanian communism, but reemerged in the 1960s as a memoirist and Nietzsche translator. Biography Origins and early life Born into a Jewish family in Ploie»ôti, he was the third child of Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his wife Sofia (n√©e Parcevska, or Parcevskaia).Eugen Simion (ed.), Dic»õionarul general al literaturii Rom√¢ne, vol. 6, pp. 325‚Äì326. Bucharest: Univers Enciclopedic, 2007. The family originated in Yekaterinoslav, a Ukrainian part of the Russian Empire: patriarch Gherea fled to Romania to escape persecution for his political activism, and worked menial jobs before getting his break in journalism.Atanasiu, pp. 373‚Äì377 At Ia»ôi, he married Sofia; she was the daughter of a Polish gourmet chef, who was also Gherea's business associate.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 42‚Äì43 Around the time of Ionel's birth, his father, mother, and his grown-up siblings were managing the Ploie»ôti Train Station Restaurant, a venue for commercial and literary transactions, but also a hangout for Romanian and exile Russian Marxists, including Leon Trotsky and Pavel Axelrod.Atanasiu, pp. 57‚Äì58, 178‚Äì180; PƒÉcurariu, passim Alexandru soon made an impact as a revolutionary socialist, and later communist, militant.Beke, pp. 240‚Äì241 Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"Un stilist al ideilor: Paul Zarifopol »ôi snobismul mesianic\\", in LaPunkt, July 21, 2014 Gherea's early education took place at home and was followed by the local Saints Peter and Paul High School, where he graduated from the sciences section. Together with his elder sister »òtefania and her husband, literary critic Paul Zarifopol, he lived in Germany for a time, especially in Leipzig, and in Italy, but returned home upon the outbreak of World War I. In his father's houses in Ploie»ôti and Sinaia, as well as in Germany, he became acquainted with Caragiale; Gherea became friends with the playwright's younger son Luca (Luki). Other cultural figures whom he met in the family homes include Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea, Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, George Co»ôbuc, Panait Cerna and Sextil Pu»ôcariu. His memoirs include sharply drawn portraits as well as revealing anecdotes about Caragiale and his elder son, Mateiu. Around 1915, young Gherea was a student at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, where he became close friends with poet Artur EnƒÉ»ôescu and met Tudor Vianu, his fellow critic.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. III, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1971, p. 321. He was also close to Lucia Demetrius, and, together with Zarifopol, helped her launch her career as a novelist. Lucia Demetrius, \\"Memorii\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 4/2004 Together with Luki, Gherea himself wrote the novel NevinovƒÉ»õiile viclene (\\"The Cunning Na√Øvet√©s\\"). A study in adolescent psychology, which has earned posthumous appreciation, Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"√én numele fiului\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 10/2001 it appeared in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ in 1920. The work shocked conservative sensibilities with its supposed libertinage, and was only taken up by the literary magazine following Zarifopol's intercession. With Luki dying the next year, Gherea never returned to fiction writing. He dedicated himself to philosophy and criticism, with essays which appeared in Revue Philosophique, Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ and its satellite, AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, Kalende, later in Zarifopol's Revista Funda»õiilor Regale and Revista de Filosofie. Such works reveal his intellectual debt to Blaise Pascal; a generous use of irony; complex readings from Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, but also of Marcel Proust, Paul Val√©ry, Francis Jammes, and Knut Hamsun. His abstract, philosophically grounded speculations somewhat resemble Zarifopol's, but unlike his onetime mentor, he often wrote down impressionist thoughts in the manner of Anatole France, one of his favorite authors, glossing over the discrepancies and limitations of the texts he discussed. He is especially known for his pioneering study on Proust's snobbery, which appeared in the 1929 edition of AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, and in which he opposed Zarifopol's own Proustianism. Dana P√Ærvan-Jenaru, \\"Receptarea lui Proust √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 436, August 2008 Pianist-philosopher Gherea was also friends with violinist-composer George Enescu: in 1927 or 1928, he accompanied Enescu as a pianist on a domestic concert tour, also leaving anecdotes from that encounter.»òtefan Cervatiuc, Istoria teatrului la Boto≈üani: 1838-1944. Vol 3: 1925‚Äì1944, Index, p. 224. Boto»ôani: Quadrant. The two reunited in 1936, when Enescu returned to the country and included Gherea on his team of touring pianists, which also included Dinu Lipatti, Alfred Alessandrescu, and Muza Ghermani Ciomac.Virgil Gheorghiu, \\"Anul muzical 1936‚Äî1937\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 10/1937, pp. 204‚Äì205 Gherea claimed that, overall, he had been Enescu's piano accompanist in as many as 300 separate performances. During those years, Gherea was writing a lengthy treatise on the philosophy of self; titled Le Moi el le monde. Essai d'une cosmogonie anthropomorphique (\\"The Self and the World. An Essay in Anthropomorphic Cosmogony\\"), it initially appeared in 1933 in the Paris-based Revue de M√©taphysique et de Morale. It was published in book form in Paris and in Bucharest in 1938. The book was noted by reviewer Constantin Floru for its disregard toward academic terminology, basing itself on \\"common sense\\", \\"years-long meditation\\", and \\"the erudition of a subtle spirit\\".Floru, p. 685 It earned Gherea the friendship and admiration of academic philosophers Constantin Noica and Petru Comarnescu, who prepared the book for Editura Funda»õiilor Regale. Noica referred to Gherea as an \\"innovative\\" asset in Romanian philosophy, comparing him to St√©phane Lupasco and Pius Servien.Chi»ôu & Noica, pp. 72, 77 Le Moi el le monde mapped out an independent phenomenology and ontology, imagining situations in which the \\"coexistence\\" of individual minds creates an implicit need for time perception, which inevitably leads them to the noumenon‚Äîhence, \\"cosmogony is anthropomorphic\\".Floru, pp. 686‚Äì689; PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, pp. 92‚Äì98 As read by Floru, Gherea understood these selves as monadic units, with direct reference to Leibniz's ontological essences.Floru, pp. 688‚Äì689 Gherea's \\"anthropomorphism\\" was nevertheless a critique of \\"naive\\" materialism, seeking to rehabilitate idealism with input from particle physics.PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, p. 167 Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, himself a historical materialist, found the work to be \\"original\\", but remained critical of Gherea's implicit agnosticism and explicit consequentialism.PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, pp. 97‚Äì98 During the early 1930s, Gherea and Noica were involved with the Criterion cultural forum. He was supposed to lecture there about the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, but, being a timid man, lost his composure; he was filled in by Mircea VulcƒÉnescu, who reused his notes.Constantin Mihai, \\"Dinamica conferin»õelor Criterionului\\", in Anuarul Institutului de CercetƒÉri Socio-umane C. S. NicolƒÉescu-Plop»ôor, Vol. 13, 2012, p. 50 He and Noica became friends, despite the latter being a right-leaning national conservative. Noica wrote in 1936: \\"One of the several things about [Gherea] that left a mark on me is that, although he lives in a leftist milieu and carries a surname dear to the Jewish and socialist circles, he has never once profited from this and has been living in want, at least not these past few years.\\"Chi»ôu & Noica, p. 73 Repression and recovery The rise of Iron Guard fascism and antisemitism was a disappointment for Gherea, a fact documented by Mihail Sebastian, a Zarifopol disciple and fellow Jewish writer.Mihail Sebastian, Journal, 1935-1944. London: Random House, 2003, p. 135. However, with VulcƒÉnescu and Noica, he remained one of the \\"young philosophers and disciples\\" who stood by metaphysician and Guard affiliate Nae Ionescu, when the latter was released from a concentration camp for political prisoners.Mircea Eliade, Autobiography, Vol. 2. 1937‚Äì1960, Exile's Odyssey, p. 83. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988. In December 1940, the Iron Guard's National Legionary government ordered his father's remains to be exhumed and reburied in a Jewish-only cemetery.Matatias Carp, Cartea neagrƒÉ. Suferin»õele evreilor din Rom√¢nia, 1940‚Äî1944. I. Legionarii »ôi rebeliunea, p. 197. Bucharest: Editura Socec, 1946 After World War II and the fall of fascism, Gherea, whose brother had taken refuge to the Soviet Union and killed as a dissident during the Great Purge, was troubled by the prospects of communization. In a 1946 interview with Ion Biberi, he expressed his support for a \\"tolerant and libertarian democracy\\", but believed that the future belonged to \\"the sort of socialism that prevents people from speaking their mind.\\"Gabriel Dimisianu, \\"La √Ænceput, la mijloc, la sf√¢r»ôit de secol\\", in Lettre Internationale (Romanian edition), Nr. 62, Summer 2007 Gherea's final decades were lived under the communist regime. Branded a \\"decadent\\" philosopher in the Marxist works of Constantin Ionescu Gulian, he was marginalized together with other thinkers of his generation. Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"C. I. Gulian, exterminatorul filosofiei rom√¢ne»ôti\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 2/2012 By 1955, his father, Constantin, was being officially recovered as a precursor of socialist realism, the standard literary dogma,Florin MihƒÉilescu, De la proletcultism la postmodernism. Constan»õa: Editura Pontica, 2002, pp. 94‚Äì95. but his works appeared only in censored form.Monica Lovinescu, Unde scurte, p. 410. Bucharest: Humanitas, 1990. Gherea was mainly focused on translation work, putting out versions of Jammes, Thomas de Quincey and Heinrich Mann into Romanian, while rendering Ion Marin Sadoveanu's Sf√¢r»ôit de veac √Æn Bucure»ôti into French. In the late 1950s, Gherea's continued visits with Noica became a subject of interest for Securitate agents, who were monitoring Noica for his former Iron Guard affiliation. Noica and many of his friends were arrested and tried in 1960, with Gherea himself interrogated. George Ardeleanu, \\"Constantin Noica √Æn vizorul SecuritƒÉ»õii. Medita»õii la limba englezƒÉ (la C√Æmpulung, √Æn 1957‚Äì1958)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 277, July 2005 Later that decade, the regime introduced controlled liberalization, and Gulian was sidelined. NevinovƒÉ»õiile viclene came out in a paperback edition at Editura Tineretului, 1969. Gherea's work became more available. His essays reprinted in Manuscriptum, then as the 1971 Eseuri (\\"Essays\\"), Gherea's 1938 study was only fully published in Romanian in 1984, as Eul »ôi lumea. Living his final years in Bucharest, Gherea was sought after by his father's Hungarian Romanian biographer and translator, Gyula Csehi, their interviews published in Igaz Sz√≥ on Gherea's 70th birthday. Csehi left this portrait of Gherea Jr: \\"His face is surprisingly like his fathers'. He is a quiet, gentle, thoughtful man, mindful of all exaggeration.\\"Beke, p. 241 Returning to philosophical work, in 1978 Gherea and Ion Herdan also published a translation from Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, also signaling a recovery for the German thinker.Simion DƒÉnilƒÉ, \\"Die Rezeption Friedrich Nietzsches in Rum√§nien\\", in Nietzsche-Studien.

Background In the spring of 1929, civil war was raging across Mexico with fighting in the central-west of the country between government forces of Emilio Portes Gil and the Cristero revolutionaries and fighting in the north between the federal government and the rebel forces of General Jos√© Gonzalo Escobar. Following the rebel defeat in the Battle of Jim√©nez on April 3, Escobar was in retreat and his men were deserting in large numbers. No longer having a war to fight, many of these deserters turned to banditry, and like in the decades before, saw the ranches on the American side of the international border as easy targets. Elmo and Ada Johnson made a living raising livestock and operating a trading post that was open to people from both sides of the river. When they established the Johnson's Ranch in 1927, the Big Bend region was still one of the most remote areas of the United States. Apart from a few Mexican homes on the southern side of the Rio Grande, the Johnson family lived in almost complete isolation; the closest population center was in Alpine, Texas, 150 miles to the north. This made it the perfect target for Mexican bandits, who could easily cross the river and take whatever they wanted back to Mexico long before the United States Army or the Border Patrol could respond. There were no Mexican authorities in the area either, with the closest being four customs and immigration officials in Santa Elena, opposite of Castolon, but they seldom patrolled the area around the Johnson's Ranch. On April 11, 1929, a band of Mexican deserters from Jim√©nez, estimated to be about thirty to forty in number, arrived on the banks of the Rio Grande. Having crossed 160 miles of the sparsely populated Chihuahuan Desert to arrive at their destination, the Mexicans made camp in the mesquite bosque adjacent to the river, near a massive cottonwood tree that was a sort of landmark in the area. Some of the men had been wounded in the fighting at Jim√©nez and were in need of medical attention, so their first task was to bring in two local curanderos (doctors without formal training, who specialized in the use of locally grown medicinal herbs) for medical assistance. Their next focus was on food, and for that they looked to the Johnson's Ranch trading post on the other side of the river. The raid Sometime during the afternoon of April 11, three Mexicans forded the river and arrived at the trading post, where they met with Elmo Johnson, begging him for food. Johnson obliged, giving the men beans and corn and telling them he would give them a goat to butcher when his herder returned later that afternoon. It remains uncertain if the Mexicans returned for the goat, but the Johnsons waited all night, keeping an eye on the Mexican camp across the river. They eventually gave up, had a late supper and went to bed later than usual. At about 11:00 that evening, Johnson awoke to the sound of horse hooves trotting close by, followed by a knock on his door. Johnson was suspicious because he did not usually do business after dark, but bandits didn't usually knock at the door either. Opening the door he was confronted by two Mexicans asking to buy tobacco in Spanish. Not wanting any trouble, Johnson agreed to sell the men some tobacco and he told them to meet him at the other end of the building, where the commissary was located. Walking across the large covered patio, Johnson lit a kerosene lamp and proceeded to unlock the commissary door. The Mexicans made their purchase; tobacco and rolling papers, which were paid for in Mexican coin. They stood in silence as they smoked. By this time, Johnson could tell his visitors were getting uneasy, and just as he turned around to pick up his rifle they took off into the darkness. Johnson followed them to the door and heard two shots fired nearby. It was then he realized that his worst fear was coming true. A group of Mexican horsemen were driving his herd of cattle and goats to the river. Johnson raised his rifle and fired at the fleeing Mexicans, but it is uncertain if he hit anything or not. The Mexicans quickly escaped into the darkness, leaving their bounty of stolen livestock along the river's edge. Aftermath The first thing Johnson did after the Mexicans were gone was to inform the Border Patrolmen George Dennis and Shelly Barnes, who drove to Castolon to report the raid to Chief Patrol Inspector Earl Falis in Marfa. Falis then informed the commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment at nearby Camp Marfa, who dispatched a 1st Lieutenant Hugh F. T. Hoffman and his Troop \\"F\\" to march to Castolon, establish a base camp there and proceed with patrolling the lower Big Bend area for bandits. Because time was of the essence, Hoffman ordered 2nd Lieutenant Harry W. Johnson (who was of no relation to the Elmo and Ada Johnson) to take his platoon from \\"F\\" Troop and a section of machine guns and proceed to Castolon in trucks to protect the nearby trading posts, while the remainder of the troop marched the 116 miles to Castolon on horseback. On the following day, Lieutenant Johnson left the machine gun section in Castolon for protection and proceeded to the Johnson's Ranch. The ranch was all quiet, so Johnson left a few men behind as guards and moved on to patrol Glenn Springs and Boquillas, which were also found to be all quiet. The next few days were spent patrolling the vast openness of the West Texas desert, but no enemies were spotted and the cavalrymen soon returned to Camp Marfa. Johnson's Ranch Airfield Refueling a US Army Air Corps Consolidated PT-3 aircraft, c.1930. Elmo Johnson is seen refueling the aircraft from a fifty-gallon drum with Lt. Charles W. Deerwester, who is on top of the plane. On the day after the raid the photographer-journalist W. D. Smithers arrived at the Johnson's Ranch to cover the story. Johnson, as hospitable as ever, was more than happy to tell his story. He also invited Smithers to stay at the ranch for a few days. During this time, Smithers brought up the idea of allowing the United States Army Air Corps to establish an airbase on the ranch property, which was located in a remote but highly strategic position in the Big Bend. Johnson agreed with Smithers, who in turn spoke with his old friend, Colonel Arthur G. Fisher, the 8th Corps Area air officer, who was stationed in San Antonio. Fisher had Johnson's Ranch inspected for use as a military airfield and found it a suitable location, but final say on the establishment of a new airfield was not up to him. Fisher then consulted with Major Robert J. Haplin, assistant chief of staff of the 8th Corps Area, as well as the senior military intelligence officer in the area, who agreed to support the project, thinking it would be an excellent place to gather intelligence about activities along the Mexican border and also a good staging point for combat operations, in case of another border emergency. Work on the new airfield began that summer and was completed by July 6, 1929, when the first landing was recorded. The site chosen was immediately north of the Johnson's Ranch headquarters, where the ranch house and trading post were located, all of which is now located within Big Bend National Park. The ranch house was thenceforth used as the headquarters for the airfield, in addition to the Johnson's ranching activities. By 1939, the airfield consisted of three graded dirt runways, the longest of which measured 4,200 feet. For the pilots, Johnson constructed two large rock piles spaced 100 feet apart near the landing threshold and at night would set two lanterns up to help guide the pilots to a safe landing. Improvements such as these made the Johnson's Ranch Airfield a \\"safe, all-weather operational facility for emergency combat aircraft.\\" The Johnson's Ranch Airfield quickly became a notable locale in the pioneer history of aviation in the United States. Many young officers who would later rise in the ranks and achieve fame and notability in World War II served at the Johnson's Ranch, among them General Nathan F. Twining, a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Jonathan M. Wainwright, a Medal of Honor recipient for his services in the Battle of Bataan. There were no further bandit raids in the Johnson's Ranch area, though the field remained open for the next fourteen years, finally being deactivated in 1943. The \\"Border Raid Mission\\", as the cavalry and air patrols became known, officially ended late in October 1931, when the \\"emergency\\" was lifted. Though they never went into action, the \\"Border Raid Mission\\" provided many young American pilots with valuable flight experience that helped prepare them for the rigorous service in World War II ten years later.

Besides its coastline, the country has a coastal plain, mountain ranges in the west, a semi-arid steppe area in the centre occupying most of the country, and a desert area in the east. Each of these zones has its own characteristic animals and plants. Geography Topographical map of Syria Syria is located in the Middle East at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Lebanon and Israel to the west, Jordan to the south and Iraq to the east. The topography consists of a narrow coastal plain in the west which rises up to the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range which runs parallel with the coast. South of this is the Homs Gap, beyond which are Mount Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains which separate Syria from Lebanon. Further east is a large area of steppe or Badia in the centre of the country. This is divided by the River Euphrates, on which a dam was built in 1973 creating a reservoir, Lake Assad, which is the largest lake in Syria. In the east and south of the country is the Syrian Desert and in the far south is the Jabal al-Druze Mountain Range. The coastal mountains and the coast have a Mediterranean climate. Here the winter is mild and wet, with up to of annual precipitation, and the summer, from May to October, hot and dry. Further inland, the rainfall levels decrease rapidly, being on the steppes and less than in the desert. There is also a much greater variation between maximum and minimum temperature inland, with frosts sometimes occurring at night and temperatures rising as high as by day in summer. Flora Al-Batar forest near Tartous Around 3,100 species of flowering plant have been recorded in Syria as well as about 112 gymnosperms. The country can be considered to be at a crossroads between various vegetation zones and the flora shows influences from three continents, Europe, Asia and Africa. The ice ages pushed Palearctic species further south, and when the climate ameliorated, some species clung on in mountainous regions of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. The prevailing westerly winds bring greater precipitation near the coast and the vegetation on the western side of the coastal mountain ranges differs from that on the eastern side, which differs again from inland mountain ranges and once again from the drought-resistant plants that grow on the eastern plateau. The terebinth, a tree of semi-arid plains In the west of the country, mild wet winters and hot dry summers provide ideal conditions for the Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests of the region which include evergreen oaks, Aleppo pines and other conifers. Where the trees have been removed for timber, sclerophyllous scrub predominates, such as maquis shrubland, and garrigue in calcareous areas. At the beginning of the twentieth century, forests covered about one third of the country, but a hundred years later, this had reduced to about 3%. The remaining forest cover is mostly in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range and consists of thorny and glossy-leaved trees such as common box, Myrtus communis, broom, terebinth, strawberry tree and wild olive. Plants found in the semi-arid and arid regions include bulbous plants such as tulips, fritallaries, Asphodeline damascena, Asphodeline lutea, crocus, iris, Drimia maritima, Colchicum hierosolymitanum and Asphodelus aestivus, and other plants such as Papaver dubium, Papaver rhoeas, Malva parviflora, Plantago ovata, Plantago coronopus, Paliurus spina- christi, Ziziphus lotus, Adonis aleppica, Adonis palaestina and Eryngium maritimum. The terebinth tree (Pistacia palaestina) grows in semi-arid areas and is a traditional source of turpentine, and the shrub Salsola vermiculata, which regenerates with as little as of rainfall, provides good fodder for livestock. Fauna Syria has a diverse fauna with 125 species of mammal, 394 of bird, 127 of reptile, 16 of amphibian and 157 species of freshwater fishes recorded in the country. Human activities have affected the biodiversity of the fauna. The Asiatic lion and cheetah, Caspian tiger and leopard (subspecies P. p. nimr and P. p. tulliana) used to be present, but they have died out in the country, and so the brown bear and the gray wolf are the largest carnivores remaining. Also present are the red fox, striped hyena, golden jackal, Egyptian mongoose, least weasel, marbled polecat, honey badger, European badger and European otter. The cat family are represented by the caracal, jungle cat, sand cat and wildcat. Grazing animals include the mountain gazelle and the goitered gazelle, the roe deer, wild goat, Nubian ibex and Arabian oryx. There are also rock hyrax, hedgehogs, hares, shrews and bats. The many species of rodents include squirrels, dormice, jerboas, gerbils, hamsters, mole-rats, jirds, voles, rats, mice and spiny mice.Masseti, M. (2009). Carnivores of Syria In: E. Neubert, Z.

Ten species of whale have been recorded off the coast as well as the endangered Mediterranean monk seal. Four species of turtle are sometimes seen, the most common being the loggerhead sea turtle, and about 295 species of marine fish have been recorded in Syria. Of the nearly four hundred species of bird recorded in the country, many are migrants, particularly visiting the coastal mountain range, the Euphrates valley and seasonal salt lakes that form in arid regions. Sabkhat al-Jabbul is a nature reserve at one of these salt lakes and is visited by migrating greater flamingoes. Endangered breeding birds include a few pairs of northern bald ibis in the north of the country, the lesser kestrel and the great bustard. Rare visiting species include the corn crake, Dalmatian pelican, white-headed duck and eastern imperial eagle.

It rises steeply above the east shore of Lake Valhalla, and less steeply above the west shore of Lichtenwasser Lake.

Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.  See also  Mt.

Along with another Aboriginal man, Bennelong, he accompanied Governor Arthur Phillip when the latter returned to England in 179293. Yemmerrawanne did not return to Australia; he fell ill, died and was buried in England. In Australia Yemmerrawanne was well-known to the British settlers; he was described by Captain Watkin Tench as a \\"good-tempered lively lad\\" who became \\"a great favourite with us, and almost constantly lived at the governor's house\\". Clothes were made for him, and he learnt to wait on the table. In February 1791, aged about 16, Yemmerrawanne was initiated, as was the Aboriginal custom, by having a front tooth knocked out. Journey to England In December 1792, Arthur Phillip left the colony on the convict transport ship Atlantic to return to England. Yemmerrawanne and Bennelong went with Phillip \\"voluntarily and cheerfully\\", knowing that their destination was \\"at a great distance\\". Atlantic called at Rio de Janeiro, where their presence was noted: They arrived at Falmouth, Cornwall in May 1793. In England After arriving in London, Yemmerrawanne and Bennelong were provided with fashionable clothing, suitable for wearing in English society. They stayed in Mayfair at the home of William Waterhouse, father of Henry Waterhouse, and visited a variety of shows and other entertainments in London. Tutors were hired to educate them in reading, writing and the English language. While in Mayfair, Yemmerrawanne and Bennelong gave a recital of a native song accompanied by clapsticks. One of their audience, Edward Jones wrote down and published the words and music (in Musical Curiosities, London, 1811), the oldest known published music from Australia. Illness and death In September 1793, Yemmerrawanne was ill and reportedly appeared \\"much emaciated\\". The following month he injured his leg, and his health continued to deteriorate. Both Aboriginal men were moved to Eltham, where Yemmerrawanne was treated by the physician Gilbert Blane. His illness persisted, despite a variety of treatments, and Yemmerrawanne died on 18 May 1794, aged about 19, from a lung infection. He was buried in the local churchyard. There have been several campaigns, including plans by Burnum Burnum and Geoffrey Robertson, to return Yemmerrawanne's remains to Australia, but the current location of his remains is unknown. The gravestone's location is known, but it has been moved several times since his burial. Name variations As is common with Aboriginal words, Yemmerrawanne's name has been recorded with several different spellings. * Imeerawanyee, in Tench's A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson * Yem-mer-ra-wan-nie, in David Collins' An Account of the English Colony of NSW * Imerewanga, by Elizabeth Macarthur * Yemmerawanya, in Phillip's letters * Yemmurravonyea Kebarrah, in the Eltham parish register entry of his death.

Location and history The building is located at No. 27 on the Bund, at the junction with East Beijing Road (formerly Peking Road). The Hong Kong-based Scottish firm Jardine Matheson started trading in Shanghai in early 1843 and became one of the first foreign businesses to set up branches in the city. The company rented this piece of land, of size 2100 square metres and a typical two storied gardened English cottage was built on it in 1845. This cottage underwent three major renovations through its history, and was replaced by a notably larger three storey building of Masonry and Wood structure In 1865, a gatehouse and a canopy were also added. The construction of the current building on the site was started in 1920, and was completed in November 1922. It was designed by Moorhead ÔºÜ Halse in Beaux-Arts style and was built by contractor Yu Chang Tai. It started as a five storey building with a floor area of 14,300 square metres. In 1930, an extra floor was added. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, the building was taken over by the Japanese firm Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Company Limited. In 1946 Jardine Matheson returned to the building but its profits fell largely so it had to rent the building to other firms. These occupants include the Cheong Hing Shipping Company and the British consulate, amongst others. In 1955, the building started to be used by the Shanghai Foreign Trade Administration Office. Another storey was added in 1983. This addition has been criticized to have altered the original building style. In 2009, the largest Rolex flagship store in the world, with a floor space of 1000 square metres, opened on the first floor of the building. Prior to its opening, the building underwent a large scale interior renovation costing 80 million RMB to restore the building's original appearance.

Although her literary contributions were relatively minor, she is noted for being at the center of a love triangle involving her first husband, »òtefan Octavian Iosif, and her second, Dimitrie Anghel. The men were close friends, but Anghel seduced her, she divorced Iosif, who died of his grief, and then Anghel shot himself during a quarrel with her, dying of the wound two weeks later. Two years after Anghel's death, her daughter with Iosif was killed by a German bomb during World War I. She lived for four and a half decades after these turbulent events, in relatively uneventful fashion. Biography Early life and first marriage Born in Buciumeni, Gala»õi, her parents were Avram Negru, a teacher, and his wife Elena (n√©e Dumitrescu). Negru attended primary school in Gala»õi, where her father worked, and high school in Bucharest. She enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University in 1901, graduating in 1907. Fond of reading in the University Foundation Library, she met its caretaker, the published poet »òtefan Octavian Iosif, in 1903. A grateful Iosif asked her for poems, one of which he published in a prominent position in SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul. In order to attract his attention, she presented an essay about one of his poems to her class. The couple married in July 1904; the three-day wedding took place at Tecucel on the outskirts of Tecuci, where her father had built her a house and granted her ten hectares of vineyards. Guests included Nicolae Iorga and Mihail Sadoveanu, who wrote accounts of the festivities. Their daughter Corina was born a year later. Dimitrie Anghel, Iosif's closest friend and a collaborator on poems, visited the family home almost daily and fell in love with Natalia. Iosif broke with Anghel in spring 1910, and became alienated from his wife that summer. Bogdan Nistor, \\"'Femeia fatalƒÉ': Natalia Negru a stat la originea mor≈£ii a doi importan≈£i scriitori rom√¢ni\\", AdevƒÉrul, February 8, 2013 Anghel eventually convinced her to move in with him, and she sued for divorce in November. She won the case the following June because two letters from Iosif proved he had left their home. In December, after suing but before the divorce was granted, she traveled to Paris for health reasons and later invited Iosif to spend a month together, presumably seeking a reconciliation. He declined, and Anghel went instead. Devastated by the betrayal of the woman he idolized and who was the inspiration behind most of his later work, as well as of his best friend, Iosif died of a stroke in June 1913. Second marriage Negru and Anghel married in November 1911; the union created hostility around them, especially in the literary circles that valued Iosif's poetry and his delicate temperament. The ostracizing atmosphere worsened after his death. Meanwhile, the marriage was deteriorating, with the temperamental and jealous Anghel locking up his wife for days at a time. The couple had frequent scenes involving screams, explosive emotions and sudden reconciliations; on at least one occasion, Anghel broke down a door and embraced his wife's feet in tears. One day in autumn 1914, a key fell out of his pocket, and she accused him of using it for romantic encounters in a hotel room. He convinced her it was for office use, but tension remained between the two. Several days later, while visiting her parents, she renewed the attack and announced she was going home. Anghel threatened to shoot her if she did not calm down; his wife believed he was joking, and continued toward the door. He pulled out his revolver and, intending to frighten her, fired toward a window. The bullet hit the metal frame of a bed and ricocheted, lightly wounding Negru. She fell to the ground; believing he had killed her, Anghel fired into his chest. The wound became infected and he died of sepsis two weeks later. At the funeral, an unknown female reportedly shouted, \\"You miserable woman, who kill all the country's great people!\\" For a long time afterwards, Negru faced public opprobrium that sometimes took hysterical turns. George CƒÉlinescu viewed her as a femme fatale without blame of her own. Her third marriage, to theologian Ioan Gheorghe Savin, appears to have been tranquil. Alex. Cistelecan, \\"Natalia, femeia- drog\\", in Revista Limba Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 11-12/2009 Subsequent life and writings In September 1916, shortly after Romania entered World War I, her daughter was killed by shrapnel from a bomb dropped by a Zeppelin. Marius Mototolea, \\"Povestea tragicului triunghi amoros din istoria literaturii rom√¢ne\\", AdevƒÉrul, February 8, 2013 With the Central Powers rapidly approaching Bucharest, she moved to Tecucel, living there exclusively from the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s. After 1945, she moved seasonally between Tecucel and a town house in Tecuci, where she died in 1962. The Tecuci house, which dates to the end of the 19th century, is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Culture Ministry. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Gala»õi She signed her early writings Natalia Iosif. Negru's work was published in CumpƒÉna, Junimea literarƒÉ, Minerva literarƒÉ ilustratƒÉ and Profiluri feminine, where she wrote the literature column. She was a founding member of the Romanian Writers' Society. Her output includes poems collected in the book O primƒÉvarƒÉ (1909), a dramatic poem (Legenda, 1921), a dramatized legend (Califul BarzƒÉ, 1921) and two autobiographical novels (MƒÉrturisiri, 1913; Helianta, 1921). The latter represented Negru's attempt to tell her side of the love triangle story, and may have been an attempt to exorcise a guilty conscience, or at least one held guilty by others. She published translations of Hans Christian Andersen, Gustave Aimard, Andr√© Theuriet, Nicholas Wiseman (Fabiola) and Prosper M√©rim√©e (Colomba).Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. II, p. 205. Pite»ôti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. Critical opinion of Negru's poetry has tended to be negative. Eugen Lovinescu placed her \\"in the unoriginality competition of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist poetesses\\", noting she \\"concocted little sentimental exuberances\\" out of typical and already stale SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist material. Constantin Ciopraga found the poems in O primƒÉvarƒÉ \\"saturated with idyllism.... easily confused with analogous productions of the period\\". Commenting on the same work, Alexandru Piru found that \\"one can remember nothing of her elegies [there]\\". A slightly more appreciative Victor Durnea finds \\"a certain lyrical, ingenuous sensibility\\" that can be \\"glimpsed.... in the recovery of certain childhood and adolescent memories\\". However, he finds her prose more redeeming. Alex. Cistelecan labels the poems \\"childish\\", speculating they may date to Negru's high school days.

Set mainly in the south of France, it tells the story of three pied noir children parted when Algeria became independent. Years later two meet again, one a married real estate agent and the other a mysterious woman being used to defraud his firm. A recurrent parallel is with the play Iphig√©nie, in which the three children had acted together, where two princesses compete for the flawed hero but one dies tragically. Plot  In the south of France, Marc Palestro is a partner in the real estate agency of his father-in-law. A client calling herself Mrs Maldonato, who is interested in buying a large old house, intrigues him. He thinks she must be Cathy, his childhood sweetheart before his family fled Algeria in 1962. Memories of that time, both the horrors of civil war and the joys of adolescent love, grip him. When he offers Mrs Maldonato a lift, she takes a dip in the sea in her underclothes and then goes to a hotel room where the two make love. She appears again to sign the preliminary contract to purchase the property. Obsessed with his first love, even though his mother tells him Cathy was killed in a bombing, Marc leaves his wife and daughter to try and find her once more. She however is the elusive front woman for a crime syndicate and is in fact an aspirant actress who is being coached in this role by Sergio Bartoli, another partner in the agency and her lover. Though she had let Marc think she was the dead Cathy, in reality she was a close friend of the pair called Marie-Jeanne and had always adored Marc. Marc discovers enough to expose Sergio's plot and then, in pouring rain, is reunited with Marie- Jeanne outside a theatre where she has secured a part.

The film gradually frees itself from the psychological mechanics to reach a kind of lyrical abstraction ‚Ä¶.The bold stand against the current climate (Dujardin in a completely lyrical and introspective role, the vagueness of time in the story, the absolute lack of irony) makes the film even more endearing.\\"(French) References External links * French films French romantic drama films 2010s romantic drama films Films scored by Stephen Warbeck 2010 drama films ","title":"A View of Love"},{"id":"47217527","text":"Patriarch Mark IV may refer to: * Pope Mark IV of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark in 1348‚Äì1363 * Patriarch Mark IV of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1385‚Äì1389 ","title":"Patriarch Mark IV"},{"id":"47217530","text":"Patriarch Mark V may refer to: * Patriarch Mark V of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1425‚Äì1435 * Pope Mark V of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark in 1603‚Äì1619 ","title":"Patriarch Mark V"},{"id":"47217532","text":"Patriarch Mark VI may refer to: * Patriarch Mark VI of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1459‚Äì1484 * Pope Mark VI of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark in 1646‚Äì1656 ","title":"Patriarch Mark VI"},{"id":"47217540","text":"Patriarch Mark II may refer to: * Mark II of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria in 141‚Äì152 * Mark II of Constantinople, Ecumenical Patriarch in 1465‚Äì1466 ","title":"Patriarch Mark II"},{"id":"47217550","text":"As a nickname, Flip may refer to: * Flip Benham (born 1948), American evangelical Christian minister and anti-abortion leader * Flip Cornett (1957‚Äì2004), American funk guitarist and bassist * Andrew Filipowski (born 1950), Polish-American technology entrepreneur * Flip Johnson (born 1963), American retired National Football League player * Flip Kowlier (born 1976), Belgian singer-songwriter * Flip Lafferty (1854‚Äì1910), American Major League Baseball player * Flip Mark (born 1948), American former child actor * Ronald Murray (born 1979), American former National Basketball Association player * Flip Nicklin (born 1948), American whale photographer * Flip Phillips (1915‚Äì2001), American jazz tenor saxophone and clarinet * Scott Phillips (musician) (born 1973), American drummer for Alter Bridge and Creed * Al \\"Flip\\" Rosen (born 1924), American Major League Baseball third baseman * Flip Saunders (born 1955), American basketball coach * Flip Simmons, Australian actor and musician * Philip Slier (1923‚Äì1943), Dutch Jewish diarist and Holocaust victim * P.

Military career Escobar was born in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa, in 1892. During the Mexican Revolution in 1913, he joined army of Venustiano Carranza and fought in the campaigns against Pancho Villa in 1914 and 1915. He later was in command of the federal cavalry in their famous charge that defeated Villa's forces one last time in the 1919 Battle of Ju√°rez. Described as \\"brave, young and dashing\\", Escobar became one of the most popular officers in the Mexican Army, following his victories in the \\"Shelf of Death\\" battle during the Adolfo de la Huerta Rebellion of 1924 and the Gomez-Serrano Revolt of 1927. In 1929, Escobar launched his own rebellion to oust jefe m√°ximo Plutarco El√≠as Calles and Emilio Portes Gil, and establish himself as President of Mexico. After winning a few battles early on and the support of thousands of followers, Escobar's forces suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Jim√©nez on April 3, 1929, and were gradually pushed back to the point of surrender by the government forces under Calles. Following the surrender of Nogales, Sonora, the last major rebel stronghold, Escobar escaped into the United States and lived in exile in Canada for many years. Shortly after the American entrance into World War II, in early 1942 Escobar returned to Mexico by way of El Paso, Texas, and offered his services to President L√°zaro C√°rdenas. By 1952 Escobar had achieved the rank of Major General and was active in politics. He died in Mexico City in 1969.

Background Little Jimmy Dickens had been the first to release \\"Please Make Up Your Mind\\" to the Canadian market under the title \\"I Wish You Didn't Love Me So Much,\\" but Dickens' version was up-tempo and included a line not found in Williams' version: ::The preacher man said, \\"For better or worse\\" ::But lately I've been lookin' for that big black hearse Williams version, however, has a different feel altogether and was almost certainly aimed at his former wife Audrey Williams, whom he had legally divorced the day before the recording session. Country music historian Colin Escott calls it the most \\"rivetingly vengeful\\" song the singer ever recorded: :\\"Over a slow blues backing and with bleak humor, Hank catalogued his grievances against Audrey: her tantrums, her attempts to belittle him, her ungovernable temper...Not until Bob Dylan's 'Positively 4th Street' was there a song so bitter and demeaning.\\" According to Escott, the original draft contained the lines, \\"Whoever said women was the weaker sex/ Baby never had you on his neck,\\" but, like lines in the Dickens version, were cut, with producer Fred Rose possibly deeming them too dark for commercial release. The song's blunt subject matter and spoken vocal ensured it to be released as a \\"Luke the Drifter\\" recording, the pseudonym for Hank's atypical releases that let jukebox operators know they were not danceable, honky tonk records. It was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville with Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), and Harold Bradley (rhythm guitar), while it is speculated that Chet Atkins played lead guitar and Ernie Newton played bass. The track also appeared on the 1953 LP Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter. This recording session, held on July 11, 1952, was Hank's next-to-last and also produced the single's B-side \\"Be Careful of Stones that You Throw\\" as well as \\"You Win Again.\\" Discography References Bibliography * 1952 singles Hank Williams songs 1952 songs Songs written by Hank Williams Song recordings produced by Fred Rose (songwriter) MGM Records singles ","title":"Please Make Up Your Mind"},{"id":"47217576","text":"Patriarch Mark of Alexandria may refer to: * Patriarch Mark I of Alexandria, ruled in 43‚Äì68 * Patriarch Mark II of Alexandria, ruled in 141‚Äì152 * Patriarch Mark III of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1180‚Äì1209 * Patriarch Mark IV of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1385‚Äì1389 * Patriarch Mark V of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1425‚Äì1435 * Patriarch Mark VI of Alexandria, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria in 1459‚Äì1484 ","title":"Patriarch Mark of Alexandria"},{"id":"47217602","text":"John Lapsley (born 24 November 1951) is a Scottish former footballer, who played for several Scottish Football League clubs in the 1970s and 1980s.

Vogel Frank A. Vogel (1888‚Äì1951) was an American banker and chief political advisor of Governor William Langer. Vogel was born in Minnesota in 1888 to Abraham and Sarah Jane (Brown) Vogel. He moved to North Dakota around 1909, where he was a teacher and school administrator in the small towns of Anamoose, Underwood and Dazey. He married Louella Larsen and, in 1917, purchased the bank in Coleharbor.  Political career  Vogel successfully ran for the North Dakota Legislature in 1921 as a member of the Nonpartisan League. He was re-elected in 1923 and 1925 and, during that last session, was elected floor leader for NPL legislators. Because of Vogel's strong support among farmers, Langer made Vogel his chief advisor as he prepared to run for governor. Langer was elected governor in 1932. In January 1933, Vogel was appointed State Tax Commissioner, and on March 15, 1933, named State Highway Commissioner. Langer appreciated Vogel's \\"liberal political philosophy, his administrative ability, and his judgment.\\" Vogel was not a \\"yes\\" man, and frequently challenged Langer's decisions. Shortly after he assumed office, Langer started encouraging all state employees to sell subscriptions to his newspaper, The Leader. Vogel thought it was a \\"rotten\\" idea and told Langer, but the governor didn't listen. Because it appeared the money collected was used for personal and political purposes, an investigation was begun in March 1934. In the spring, a federal grand jury indicted Langer, Vogel and seven others on charges of soliciting and collecting money from federal employees for political purposes and of conspiring to obstruct the orderly operation of an act of Congress. Langer, Vogel and three other Langer appointees were found guilty on June 17. Vogel was sentenced to federal prison for 13 months and fined $3,000. He, Langer and the others appealed their convictions, and after three more trials, Langer and Vogel were cleared of all charges. Later, Vogel became the President of The Bank of North Dakota. During Vogel's eight years as President of the State Bank, total resources climbed from $23 million to $78 million. Perhaps the most lasting legacy left by Vogel was the student loan program he created with his associate, Martin Stenehjem.http://www.inforum.com/content/vogel-left-3-generation-legacy  Children  One of Vogel's five son, Robert Vogel, was U.S. attorney and a justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court. Another son, William (Bill) Vogel was an attorney in Salt Lake City. Another of his sons, Frank Vogel, fell during WWII in the Invasion of Normandy.http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/news/vogel.htm His granddaughter, Sarah Vogel, became the country's first female North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner when she was elected in 1988.

History The pitakataik dates to the pre-colonial era. During the Pagan Kingdom era, Anawrahta commissioned a square-shaped pitakataik that measured , built in the style of a temple with a central plinth surrounded by a corridor, located from the Tharabha Gate. Subsequent monarchs, including Kyansittha, Htilominlo, and Kyaswa, continued the tradition of building pitakataiks during their reigns, ushering in a tradition of royals and laypersons alike commissioning pitakataiks. By the First Toungoo Empire era, the pitakataik was considered a requisite edifice for a royal capital, and was built in Bayinnaung's capital of Hanthawaddy (now Bago, Myanmar). By the Konbaung dynasty, the pitakataik was one of the seven integral structures (·Äî·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·Ää·Ä∫ ·Äû·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Äå·Ä¨·Äî) whose foundations had to be laid in establishing a royal capital, demonstrating its importance. A royal pitakataik was built in each of the Konbaung kingdom's royal capitals, including Amarapura, Inwa, and Mandalay. According to an contemporaneous British account in 1795, the Pitakataik at Amarapura was described as the largest library between the Danube and China. During the establishment of Mandalay as a royal capital, King Mindon Min commissioned the construction of a pitakataik at the foot of Mandalay Hill. Copies of Tipi·π≠aka texts were relocated from the Amarapura Pitakataik and deposited at the newly constructed library in January 1864. In October 2013, the Sitagu Sayadaw announced a donation to rebuild the Mandalay Pitakataik, along with the Thudhamma Zayat and Maha Pahtan Ordination Hall, with the consultation of Tampawaddy U Win Maung.

Gregory published canonical provisions concerning marriages (matchmaking, dowry), the education of monks and dogmatic differences with the Catholic Church and the Protestants, he forbid burial inside churches and he condemned the translation of the Bible in a simpler form of the Greek language.

The increasing appearance of Protestant tracts and missionaries in the eastern Mediterranean following the end of the Napoleonic Wars was particularly distressing to Patriarch Gregory VI. The vigour of Gregory's efforts to insulate his flock, not only in the Ottoman Empire but also in the Kingdom of Greece and the United States of the Ionian Islands, from heterodox religious influences incurred the displeasure of all governments in the region during the late 1830s. In 1839, these tensions came to a head when the patriarch issued an encyclical condemning various uncanonical changes to family law promulgated by the British colonial authorities on the Ionian Islands. The British ambassador, John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby, bluntly demanded the removal of Gregory and threatened to leave Istanbul over the matter. Under duress, the Ottoman foreign minister Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha agreed to Ponsonby's demand. The minister insisted, however, on delaying the dismissal until the Ottoman government could first legitimize its action by carrying out a formal judicial inquiry into Gregory VI's alleged misbehaviour.Jack Fairey, \\" 'Discord and Confusion...under the Pretext of Religion': European Diplomacy and the Limits of Orthodox Ecclesiastical Authority in the Eastern Mediterranean\\", International History Review 34, no. 1 (2012): 19 - 44. Gregory VI was finally deposed by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I on February 20, 1840 and retired to his house in Arnavutk√∂y. He was reelected 27 years later, after the resignation of Sophronius III of Constantinople, on February 10, 1867 and resigned on June 10, 1871. He died on June 8, 1881. He was buried in the forecourt of the Holy Church of Asomati in Arnavutk√∂y and in 1906 his bones were recovered.  Sources  * ŒüŒπŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œå Œ†Œ±œÑœÅŒπŒ±œÅœáŒµŒØŒø *Augustinos, Gerasimos.

Even with its unparalleled amenities and initial popularity, the creation of Interstate 10 approximately one mile to the west in the early 1960s proved to be detrimental to Tucson House. The creation of Interstate 10 meant that most traffic bypassed the city core and severely curtailed in-town through traffic. The popularity of many motels and businesses along the once-booming Oracle Road collapsed, and the marketplace dramatically transformed within a decade. By the mid 1970s, Tucson House occupancy declined as the Oracle Area continued to deteriorate, and the federally insured mortgage was foreclosed. The property was auctioned in October 1976 to HUD, which provided a grant to the City of Tucson to purchase it.http://www.tucsonaz.gov/files/preservation/Oracle_Area_Context_Study.pdf In 1979, the City of Tucson acquired the 408-unit Tucson House complex and converted it to public housing for the elderly and disabled.

The film premiered at the 2012 Santa Rosa International Film Festival. Overview While driving through Oakland, California on their way to a benefit concert for the Redwood Summer campaign to save California's coast redwood trees, Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were injured when a pipe bomb detonated under the driver's seat of their car. Bari, who was driving, was critically injured. Oakland police and the FBI approached the explosion as a terrorist incident, arrested Bari and Cherney, and tried to prove that they were transporting their own explosive device which accidentally detonated. The two were never charged with a crime. In 2002 they won a lawsuit and were awarded $4.4 million for civil rights violations by the FBI and Oakland Police Department. The authorities allegedly did not investigate any other suspects. Discovery during the lawsuit revealed crime scene photos that clearly showed the bomb was located under Bari's seat, not in the back seat as investigators had alleged. In 2012, a federal judge ordered the FBI not to destroy another pipe bomb that had only partially detonated at a lumber mill about a week before the car bombing, which investigators agreed had been built by the same bomber. Attorney for Darryl Cherney, Ben Rosenfeld, had requested that an outside lab perform DNA testing on the Cloverdale bomb, which the FBI claimed it had never performed, a request which the judge upheld.

Biography Born in Castellamonte in the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, Lebolo became a gendarme during the Napoleonic occupation of Italy; after the Restauration he fled to Egypt where he became an agent of Bernardino Drovetti, who was the French Consul-General of Egypt as well as an ardent antiquities collector. Lebolo oversaw many excavations mainly in the zone of Luxor, usually on behalf of Drovetti and sometimes for himself. He apparently was as ruthless as his boss Drovetti, as Giovanni Battista Belzoni reported during one of his excavations at Karnak in 1818 and later: along with another Piedmontese agent named Rosignani, Lebolo harassed and maybe even tried to murder Belzoni, and later managed to steal some of his finds excavated at Philae., p. 166 Between 1817 and 1821 Lebolo found a mummy cache in a shaft tomb at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna. The finest mummies were given to Drovetti and are now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin (no. 504, 505), others were sold to Heinrich Menu von Minutoli, Giovanni Anastasi, Fr√©d√©ric Cailliaud and Henry Salt; Salt placed the objects he bought in the British Museum (no. 6705, 6706, 6708 and likely 6950). Lebolo kept the remaining mummies for himself. Lebolo died some years after these events, possibly on February 19, 1830 in Castellamonte or in an unknown date in Trieste. Joseph Smith Papyri Joseph Smith Papyrus I A few years later, a man named Michael H. Chandler claimed to be Lebolo's nephew and demanded Lebolo's goods in inheritance. In 1833 he obtained the inheritance and took the mummies and some accompanying papyri to the United States, selling them during his travels. In 1835, Chandler met Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, and some of his affiliates. Since Smith claimed to be able to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs, Chandler showed him the papyri. Smith purchased the mummies and papyri, and interpreted some of the writings and scenes as some life events of the two patriarchs Abraham and Joseph. The papyri were soon called the Joseph Smith Papyri and formed the core of Smith's Book of Abraham.

He was Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the New School for Social Research in New York. Yovel had also been a political columnist in Israel, cultural and political critic and a frequent presence in the media. Yovel was a laureate of the Israel Prize in philosophy and officier of the French order of the Palme acad√©mique. His books were translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Hebrew, Korean and Japanese. Yovel was married to Shoshana Yovel, novelist and community organizer, and they had a son, Jonathan Yovel, poet and law professor, and a daughter, Ronny, classical musician, TV host and family therapist.  Biography   Education and early philosophical development  Born in Haifa, Palestine, then under a British mandate, Yirmiyahu Yovel graduated in 1953 from the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa. Following his mandatory military service he studied philosophy and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. in 1961 and M.A. in 1964. He supported his studies as radio news editor and presenter. However, he declined a permanent career in broadcasting and went to the Sorbonne and Princeton University to complete his philosophical studies. In 1968 he earned his PhD from the Hebrew University. His adviser was Nathan Rothenstreich. Yovel came to the university driven by existential philosophical concerns and suspicious of rationalism. Upholding individual subjectivity, young Yovel was estranged from the collectivist ideals and political ideologies of the time (including the socialist-Zionist ethos), because of their demand to monopolize and politicize all intellectual concerns. Religion, too, was not the answer, but rather an escape. Yovel has shared from the start Nietzsche's radical drive to existential lucidity, which can be emotionally taxing but also liberating. It was, in particular, Kant's program of critical reason (though not its actual execution), and the concept of finite rationality that provided Yovel with the terms for a constructive critique of rationalism, one that recognizes rationality as indispensable for human life and culture, even while taking its finitude more radically than Kant's, by admitting its fallibility, open-endedness, and non-absolute nature. Yovel holds that the history of philosophy is embedded in most philosophical discourse, and that often it contains issues and insights that can be fruitfully contemporized by a method of immanent reconstruction. His own philosophical position can be described as \\"a philosophy of immanence,\\" which, following Spinoza, views the immanent world as all there is and as the sole possible source of social and political normativity. The latter theme was extensively probed in his two-volume Spinoza and Other Heretics (Princeton, 1989), which traces the idea of immanence back to Spinoza and follows its adventures in later thinkers of modernity from Kant and Hegel to Nietzsche and beyond. Yovel was to return as visiting professor both to Princeton University (1970‚Äì71) and the Sorbonne (1978‚Äì80), among other foreign appointments. His years on both sides of the Atlantic helped shape Yovel's attitude towards Anglo-American analytic philosophy. He shares its demand for clarity and precision ‚Äì this was recognized as a hallmark of his writing ‚Äì but criticized its often scholastic tendencies and a-historical approach. Following his academic and public activity Yirmiyahu Yovel became a prominent voice in Israeli intellectual life. His numerous columns in major papers, mostly Ha'aretz and Yediot Aharonot, probed public attitudes and government policies. He was an early advocate of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, and strongly opposed the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza as politically wrong and motivated by false Messianism.  Journalism and public activity  Yovel's involvement in journalism started in his student days. In 1960‚Äì64 he worked for radio Israel and co-founded its weekly news magazine. In 1967 he participated in the project of creating an independent Israeli broadcasting authority, serving two terms on its council. Later he edited the first political documentaries of Israel TV, and during 1975‚Äì1978 he edited and hosted 30 major TV programs on social and political issues (drugs, gay liberation, divorce, adoption, violence in sports, Arab land rights; the right to die, etc.). His viewers also remembered him as a military reporter in the Sinai frontline in both the 1967 and 1973 war. In 1973 he was among the few journalists who insisted on reporting the truth about Israel's military setbacks in the early stage of the war. After Labor's historic defeat in 1977, he joined \\"Circle 77,\\" a group of intellectuals that tried to reform the Labor party, but found himself unfit for party politics. Henceforth he focused on the written press, publishing scores of political columns until the 1990s.  Academic career  Most of Yovel's career took place at the Hebrew University, where he served in various academic posts and held the Shulman Chair of Philosophy. During that time, he also visited and lectured in numerous universities and institutes worldwide including Columbia, Hamburg, Milan, Oxford, Paris IV (\\"Sorbonne - Pantheon\\"), and others. In 1994 he accepted an appointment to teach annually one-term at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research which became his \\"second academic home.\\" He was then nominated to the inaugural Hans Jonas Chair in Philosophy, from which he retired in 2010. In 1986, Yovel founded the Jerusalem Spinoza Institute with a dual intention ‚Äì to foster Spinoza scholarship, and to promote public education around ideas associated with Spinoza (such as democracy, secularism, and tolerance) both as all- European thinker and as an emblematic figure of Jewish modernity). In 2000 Yovel won the Israel Prize for his achievements in philosophy. His thank-you address on behalf of his fellow laureates was entitled \\"A Report on the State of Reason.\\" Reason is alive and breathing, Yovel reported, but is besieged by inner and outer enemies. Reason's \\"inner enemy\\" is its over-ambitious tendency to exceed its limits and control, and three \\"external enemies\\": mysticism, global commercial culture, and post- modern radical critique. Yovel argued that these challenges can be tackled by a sober attitude, committed to reason all while accepting its fallibility, finitude, and lack of absolute character. This is rationality \\"on a human scale,\\" rather than a secular replica of religion. Publications Yirmiyahu Yovel's published numerous scholarly articles and several books, among them Kant and the Problem of History (Princeton 1980,86) Spinoza and Other Heretics (Princeton 1989), Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche and the Jews (Polity 1996) and The Other Within: The Marranos (Princeton 2013). He translated into Hebrew two major philosophical classics (Spinoza's Ethics and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason) with systematic introductions, and edited several collective books, including a 5-volume encyclopedia of Jewish modern secular culture. Yovel's credits as journalist include dozens of press columns and 30 major TV programs. Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics Yovel's first book, based on his PhD dissertation, was Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics (1974, in Hebrew.) While Kant had been often held to have destroyed metaphysics, Yovel's book argues that Kant's actual program was to renew it, by replacing the old dogmatic metaphysics with a new critical one. Metaphysical questions are deeply significant even when they exceed the range of legitimate answers. To either repress the questions or to pretend answering them is equally irrational. Reason in Kant has a metaphysical interest and a critical interest that are equally indispensable, yet contradict each other in the absence of a critique. The critical turn resolves this antinomy in two stages. First, it establishes a system of synthetic a-priori categories and principles that functions as a valid metaphysics of the immanent (empirical) domain; and, secondly, in the Dialectic, it re-orients the metaphysical drive from its search of empty, illusory objects back into the empirical world, and makes us realize our fundamental finitude, as well as the endlessly open horizons within this world which we can explore.Wolfgang Bartuchat, \\"Yirmiahu Yovel, Kant and the Philosophy of History\\", Archiv Fuer Geschichte der Philosophie , 66 Band Heft 3, 1984. By metaphysics Kant understood a system of supersensible elements that (1) determines the entities in the sensible world, and (2) concerns the meaning of their being. The Kantian synthetic a-priori categories and principles fulfill the first role, but do so critically, since they are not supersensible objects existing in themselves but are only ingredients in the synthesis of empirical objects. As such they also determine what it means for empirical objects to be (namely, to be a synthesis of sense perceptions linked by the categories.) The a priori system is thus not only an epistemology, but equally an ontology of finite, natural beings. The book also highlights the dynamic, self-driving nature of Kantian reason (which Yovel sometimes calls \\"erotic\\" in the Platonic sense). Human rationality is not a mere calculus in Kant but a goal-oriented activity, which projects its own inherent ends and strives to realize them. Finally, the book describes Kant's method as the self-explication of reason, which depends upon its own history, including a series of collapses, and culminates in a critical revolution. Kant and the Philosophy of History Yovel's major work on Kant was to become his Kant and the Philosophy of History (Princeton 1980, 1986; French 1989). Kant's historical thought had for a long time been ignored, or dismissed as marginal and inconsistent. Yovel's work was instrumental in reversing this outlook. The book goes beyond Kant's customary moral teaching, which revolves on the formal and personal characteristics of morality, to uncover a second, material tier in Kant's practical philosophy, in which the moral will becomes a world-shaping will: the will is not satisfied with its personal morality alone, but works to reshape the entire social-historical world as \\"a moral totality\\". The will does not only strive to make itself good, but to reshape its world in its own image‚Äîto see its moral goals embodied in the actual world's ways and institutions. This makes possible a critical philosophy of history, and of particular areas within it‚Äîpolitics, law, social ethics, moral education, and a religion of reason.Kenneth Kierans, \\"Kant and the Philosophy of History. By Yirmiyahu Yovel\\", Dalhousie Review Vol.69 No.2 The lever leading to the second stage is Kant's concept of \\"The Highest Good\\" and the imperative to promote it. A close analysis of this concept leads Yovel to interpret it as the Kantian regulative idea of history, an ideal that combines maximal morality (personal and institutional, ethical and political) with universal well-being and prosperity. Kant even calls the historical task \\"the ultimate end of creation itself\\"Kant, Critique of Judgment ¬ß84), thus suggesting that moral history, in which humans change themselves and reform the world, is the only possible justification of there being a world and a human race, which otherwise would be utterly contingent and meaningless.Darrel E. Christensen, \\"Yirmiahu Yovel. Kant and the Philosophy of History [et.al.]\\", 40, December 1986. In method, the book is not a narrative commentary but a systematic reconstruction. While relying on careful textual analyses, it organizes the material in relation to the inner logic and latent implications of Kant's positions, which allow Yovel to draw new conclusions that shed light on unknown aspects in his philosophy. The book had strong echoes which reversed the traditional outlook. Today there is even talk of Kant's \\"historical turn\\", a concept unheard of in the past). A noted German philosopher, director of the Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung (Institute for Social Research, the institutional home of the Frankfurt School and critical theory) recently described the book's impact: > \\"When I first read Yirmiyahu Yovel's marvelous book on Kant and the > Philosophy of History almost twenty years ago, I learned how one should > approach the task of interpreting classical texts: Starting from the > identification of a central problem in a philosopher\`s writings, one must > try rearrange the elements of the proposed solution until a new idea emerges > that goes beyond the original author's explicit intentions. Because I was > extremely impressed by this method the way it was applied to Kant's > systematic thought, I not only became a regular and eager reader of > Yirmiyahu Yovel's publications, but I also tried to emulate this mode of > thinking in my own work\\" (‚ÄîAxel Honneth, 2010). Spinoza and other Heretics Yovel's best-known book is Spinoza and other Heretics, (Princeton 1989), a diptych in two volumes that offers a new interpretation of the existential origins of Spinoza's intellectual revolution (Vol. I) and its developments in later thinkers of modernity (Vol. II). Spinoza appealed to Yovel primarily by his radical principle of immanence, which Yovel sees as paradigmatic of much of modern thought, and by his striking personal case. No modern thinker before Nietzsche has gone as far as Spinoza in shedding all historical religion and all horizons of transcendence. In wondering what had enabled Spinoza to tear himself so drastically from the Western theistic tradition, Yovel did not turn directly to the rational arguments that drove Spinoza, but looked first for the historico-existential situation that cleared the mental space for those arguments to emerge and take hold in the mind.Seymour Feldman, \\"A Durable Heresy\\", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990 The answer, Yovel suggested, is linked to the dualities and confused religious identity of the peculiar Jewish group from which Spinoza came, the so-called Marranos, who before arriving in Holland had lived for generations in Spain and Portugal as forced converts from Judaism, absorbing Christian symbols, mental patterns and ways of thinking. Former Jews who tried to remain Jewish in secret had only scant knowledge of Judaism, and what they knew they conceptualized in Christian terms; while others, having mixed the two religions, ended up neither Jews nor Christians, and looked to the affairs of this life and this world as a substitute to religious salvation in either Jesus or Moses. However, describing the events of Marranos responding to the miracle in the Convent of S√£o Domingos in Lisbon on April 19, 1506 with statements such as \\"How can a piece of wood do miracles?\\", or \\"Put some water to it and it'll go out\\", Yovel states that these words \\"expressed the same rough Jewish common sense resisting the Catholic sense of mysterium and insisting on calling super-rational phenomena by their earthly names.\\" The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity By Yirmiyahu Yovel, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 198-199 The Marrano experience, Yovel suggests, made it possible for several ex-Marranos to adopt the immanent and \\"secular\\" standpoint which Spinoza radicalized and gave it a powerful systematization.Seymour Feldman, \\"A Durable Heresy\\", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990 Volume One (The Marrano of Reason) uses historical and literary materials to elicit a set of typical and recurring Marrano patterns (for example: life on two levels, overt and concealed; the use of equivocation and dual language; the search for an alternative way to salvation, replacing Jesus and Moses with philosophical reason, etc.) which in Spinoza are transposed from the context of religion to that of reason. From the other direction, key philosophical issues in Spinoza (language, politics and the multitude, the third kind of knowledge) are also, at the same time, shown to be responding to Marrano-like elements that further illuminate and contextualize them. Yovel insists that this contextualization is not reductive: Spinoza's ideas have an independent rational import that cannot be reduced to the historical circumstances that allowed them to arise.Seymour Feldman, \\"A Durable Heresy\\", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990 A heretic to all religions, Spinoza was banned by the rabbis but refused to convert to Christianity. By calling him \\"the first modern Jew\\", Yovel highlights his relevance to the Modern Jewish situation. His case - even more than his thought - anticipated most of the rival and contradicting solutions that were offered in later centuries to non-orthodox Jewish existence. Yet Spinoza himself neither advocated nor personally realized any of those options. He thus became, involuntarily, a founding father of almost all the forms of modern life in which he himself did not participate.Seymour Feldman, \\"A Durable Heresy\\", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990 Volume Two (The Adventures of Immanence) uncovers the presence of Spinoza's revolution in some major turns of modern thought. Yovel distinguishes between naturalism and the broader concept of a \\"philosophy of immanence\\". The latter maintains that (a) immanent reality is all there is, the overall horizon of being; (b) it is also (through humans) the only valid source of moral and political norms; and (c) interiorizing this recognition is a precondition to whatever liberation or redemption humans can hope for. Yovel takes the reader into the latent and overt conversation with Spinoza in the work of Kant, Hegel, the left-Hegelians (Heine, Feuerbach, Hess), Marx, Nietzsche and Freud - all of whom shared a core philosophy of immanence but worked it out in rival ways, which also diverge from Spinoza's. This approach makes vividly present Spinoza's influence on modernity, including Jewish modernity. In the Epilogue, speaking for himself, Yovel argues for a critical philosophy of immanence to modify Spinoza's \\"dogmatic\\" one.Seymour Feldman, \\"A Durable Heresy\\", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990 The book was widely discussed and translated into French, German, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche and the Jews This book treats the so-called \\"Jewish question\\"' as primarily a question for Europe with itself. Hegel was a philosopher of reason and Nietzsche its outright opponent; Hegel was a (heterodox) Christian and Nietzsche a self-proclaimed 'Antichrist'; Hegel sought to bring rational modernity to its climax and Nietzsche wanted to replace it with a \\"Dionysian\\"culture based upon the \\"will to power\\". Yet each in terms of his project had to grapple with the issue of Judaism and the Jews. The result was ambivalence of two different kinds.Philippe Raynaud, \\"La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474. The young Hegel manifested a harsh anti-Jewish attitude which his mature philosophy mitigated. Reversing his early claim that the Jews had contributed nothing worthwhile to humanity, the older Hegel went as far as to attribute to Judaism one of the most consequential turning points in human history: the recognition that absolute being is Spirit, not a thing or a natural entity, and that Spirit is higher than nature. Yet Judaism falsified its own revolution in the very act of performing it, because it shaped itself as \\"a religion of sublimity\\", by which Hegel means a religion of self- alienation and slavish submission to an infinitely remote Master, before whom the individual stands in dread as a complete nullity. In this dialectical fashion, the mature Hegel tacitly condemned the Jews in the very act of praising them. Furthermore, unlike Nietzsche, Hegel denied post-Christian Jews any historical significance and value. It followed from Hegel's logic of history that the Jews had lost their raison d'√™tre already in antiquity and become the empty shell of their former self. Yet while he was puzzled and disturbed by their long survival as a theoretical paradox (a \\"dark riddle\\"), this did not prevent Hegel from supporting political emancipation and social acceptance for the contemporary Jews, an unpopular position in Germany at the time. Hegel looked down on German xenophobic nationalism, and as a philosopher of freedom he chose, without enthusiasm, to admit the Jews into the modern world as a necessary recognition of their humanity.Philippe Raynaud, \\"La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474. Nietzsche not only overcame the anti-Jewish prejudice of his early years but, unlike Hegel, did so with passion. Following his break with Wagner and Schopenhauer the mature Nietzsche came into his own as an ardent anti- anti-Semite. To him, the modern anti-Semite was a creature of ressentiment, and as such was the genealogical cousin of the ancient Jewish priest, whom Nietzsche despised with the same ardor, and for the same psycho-philosophical reasons. Nietzsche refused to attribute to Judaism a single unchanging essence. His attitude, as reconstructed in this book, varies according to three phases in Jewish history. (1)The Old Testament Hebrews were the object of Nietzsche's admiration on account of their grand figures, great deeds, and authentic self-affirmation. (2) Nietzsche loathed and reviled the ‚Äòpriestly' Judaism of the Second Temple (and Testament), primarily because it had engendered Christianity and the \\"slave morality\\" that corrupted Europe alongside Socratic rationalism. (3) He admired the Jews of the Diaspora because of their historical depth and the existential power they accumulated in centuries of resistance and perseverance. This power Nietzsche now wanted to pour into the new Europe he envisioned. He therefore expects urged the Jews to become secularized, to mix with other Europeans, to excel in all European affairs and eventually set new standards and values to them. The Jew's existential vigor and anti-Christian disposition would then pour into Europe, promoting a Dionysian revolution of values. Unlike Hegel, then, Nietzsche treats the Jews as an ethnic, historical human group and not primarily a religion.Philippe Raynaud, \\"La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474. This book, published in Hebrew in 1996 and translated into English, French, Japanese, and Rumanian, also shows that universal reason does not necessarily exclude a strong anti-Jewish bias, and a philosophy of power must not necessarily be anti-Semitic. The Other Within: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity Following his interest in Spinoza, Yovel was intrigued by the broader phenomenon of the Marranos and studied it for its own sake. The result was another opus: The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity (Princeton 2009). Yovel describes the Marranos as \\"the other within\\"‚Äîpeople who both did and did not belong. Rejected by most Jews as renegades and by most veteran Christians as Jews with impure blood, Marranos had no definite, integral identity, Yovel argues. The \\"Judaizers\\"-Marranos who wished to remain secretly Jewish - were not actually Jews, and those Marranos who wished to assimilate were not truly integrated as Hispano-Catholics. Rather, mixing Jewish and Christian symbols and life patterns, Marranos were typically distinguished by a split identity. They also discovered the subjective mind, engaged in social and religious dissent, and demonstrated early signs of secularity and this-worldliness. In these ways, Yovel says, the Marranos anticipated many central features of Western modernity, and also of the modern Jewish experience. Historians who see their work as constructive of the national identity tend to appropriate the Marranos (or, Conversos) exclusively to their own nation and culture. Yovel's book argues it is impossible to attribute any integral and univocal identity to the Marranos, neither Jewish nor Hispano-Catholic, since it was, precisely, the disintegration of the compact characteristic of medieval society which is the most distinctive and interesting feature of these people, and one of the main contributions they made to early-modern Europe. One of this book's philosophical conclusions is that the split identity which the Inquisition persecuted and modern nationalism condemns as illicit, is a genuine and inevitable shape of human existence, which deserves recognition as a basic human freedom.

It‚Äôs known to be an oldest and powerful temple in Puducherry. The age of the temple is not known for centuries and could be easily about 1000 years old.  History  Veerampattinam is a fishing village and a man named Veeraraghavan was living there in an ancient time. One fine morning, he set out for fishing in a nearby rivulet. He had no catch till sunset and was totally disappointed but he didn‚Äôt give up and made a final attempt before he returned home. When he was withdrawing the net, he was very happy as he felt a heavy resistant which is usually due to a big catch. But he disappointed eventually as there was no fish instead it was a big piece of wood. He took it home and kept it in the backyard. One day his wife found no firewood for cooking and decided to cut the wood to make it useful. When she hit the wood with an axe, it was shocking and she couldn‚Äôt believe it as blood was oozing out from the axe cut. She immediately informed her husband and the villagers. Astonished Veeraraghavan kept the wood inside his home and started performing pooja. He was very happy and life became prosperous for him. After some days, Amman (Lady God) appeared in Veeraraghavan‚Äôs dream and told him that you got the wood because of my blessings. She asked him to use the wood as Peeta (Base) and to install her idol on the base at a specific location in the village. She asked him to workship the idol as \\"Sengazhuneer Amman\\" before disappearing from his dream. Veeraraghavan informed the villagers about his dream. All the villagers set out to find the place indicated by Amman. They found an ant-hill from where a serpent (cobra) came out and beat the ground thrice with its hood, thus showing them the place where they had to establish the idol. The wood was brought for setting the peeta and made a granite idol of Sengazhuneer Amman head. The temple was gradually developed stage by stage from a small hut to a huge temple over the centuries. A temple car was made centuries ago and it was the first temple in the province of Puducherry to have a temple car.  Festival  A grand festival is celebrated every year for six continuous Fridays starting from the Tamil month of Aadi. Special importance is given to the fifth Friday and is declared as public holiday by the Government of Puducherry. On this day, thousands of pilgrims throng this holy place to pull the Temple car and celebrate the festival. The festival is being celebrated since the date immemorial. Right from the days of the French rule, it was a custom to invite the Lt. Governor of Puducherry to commemorate the festival and start the Temple car procession by pulling its super giant rope. The last Friday will evidence ‚Äòmuthu pallakku‚Äô festival which is the end of the six- week-long festival. Over 100,000 to 200,000 people from different regions Puducherry and Tamil Nadu will gather for 5th and 6th Fridays. The people of the village come together to organize and celebrate the festival in a greater way with happiness. Other festivals including Masi Magam, Mattu pongal, Kavadi, Vinayaka Chaturthi, Ammbu vizha (Vijayadashami) and Thirukaarthigai (Sokka Paanai) were also celebrated at different occasions.

He suffered from poor health during his brief life and was considered to those who knew him to be a gentle and pious individual. Sulprizio was beatified in late 1963 after the recognition of two miracles (direct healings) attributed to his intercession. Pope Francis confirmed his canonization on 8 June 2018 after the confirmation of a second miracle and Sulprizio was canonized on 14 October 2018. Life Nunzio Sulprizio was born on 13 April 1817 to Domenico Sulprizio (who was born in Popoli) and Rosa Luciani just after Easter; he was named after his paternal grandfather Nunzio who died on 8 September 1803. His parents had married on 28 May 1816 and he himself was born during a time of great famine. He was baptized before sunset mere hours after his birth. His parents took him to the Bishop of Sulmona Francesco Tiberi on 16 May 1820 so he could receive his Confirmation in the faith. His father died on 31 July 1820 and his mother remarried in 1822 for financial support to a much older man; his little sister Domenica died just months after their father on 7 December 1820. His stepfather viewed Sulprizio with little more than harshness and contempt. The relationship between the two was nonexistent and Sulprizio bonded more with his mother and maternal grandmother. During this period he attended the school in Corvara that the priest De Fabiis managed. It was around this time he also started to attend school that a local priest ran where he learned to read and to write. In his childhood he took the time to attend Mass and come to know Jesus Christ but also to follow His example and that of the saints. His mother died on 5 March 1823 and he and was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Anna Rosaria Luciani del Rossi who was illiterate but firm in the faith. The two often took walks together and attended Mass on a regular basis. He also began to attend the school for poor students that Father Fantacci managed; his grandmother later died on 4 April 1826. It was following this that his uncle - Domenico Luciani (often called \\"Mingo\\") - took him on as an apprentice blacksmith. His uncle was harsh on him and often left him without proper nourishment and did not feed him if he perceived that Sulprizio needed either discipline or correction. He sent Sulprizio to run errands regardless of the distance which put a great strain upon him. He was also beaten or cursed if his uncle did not like how he did his errands. The work was too much for him due to his age and he contracted a disease in 1831. This occurred one winter morning when his uncle sent him to the slopes of Rocca Tagliata for supplies. That evening he became exhausted and had a swollen leg and a burning fever forcing him to bed. He did not mention this to his uncle though the next morning found he could no longer stand. His uncle was indifferent to his suffering. His condition was later diagnosed as gangrene in one leg. He was hospitalized first in L'Aquila between April and June and then in Naples. Despite his pain he dealt with it with patience and his offering his pain to God. During his illness at home he needed to clean his sore on a constant basis since it oozed puss. There was one occasion where he went to a stream close to home to clean his wound but a woman who came to wash her clothes chased him off after telling him that he would pollute the water. Instead he found another stream and was able to recite several rosaries as he let the water clean his sore. The hospitalized Sulprizio later met his paternal uncle - Francesco Sulprizio (a soldier) - who introduced him to a fellow soldier: Colonel Felice Wochinger. His uncle introduced him to that colonel in 1832. The two's relationship soon grew until it became that of father and son. Gaetano Errico - future saint - promised him that he would admit him into his religious order when the time was right. On 20 June 1832 he entered the Hospital of the Incurables to seek further treatment with the colonel providing for all his needs during this time. He also prepared for his First Communion during this time and was enthusiastic about receiving it earlier despite the fact that rules dictated that he had to be fifteen. He also went to spa treatments on the island of Ischia and was able to abandon crutches in favor of a simple walking stick. In 1835 the doctors decided to amputate his leg as their sole option but his pain continued. His situation worsened in March 1836 and his suffering increased when his fever increased. He continued to place his trust in God and was well aware of the fact that the end was near. Two months later on the date of his death he asked for a crucifix to be brought to him before summoning his confessor and to receive the sacraments for the last time. He died in 1836 due to the disease he contracted. His remains are now located in the Church of San Domenico Soriano in Naples. Decades after his death Pope Leo XIII proposed Sulprizio as a model for workers. Sainthood Sulprizio's canonization in 2018. The beatification process opened in both Naples and Pescara-Penne in an informative process that was launched on 3 July 1843 and which later concluded over a decade later on 5 September 1856; Pope Pius IX launched the cause on 9 July 1859 in which he was titled as a Servant of God. Theologians later approved his writings being in line with official Church doctrine on 7 September 1871 while the Congregation for Rites validated the informative phase sometime later on 20 September 1877. In September 1884 an antepreparatory committee met to discuss the cause as did a preparatory one in October 1889 and a last general committee on 6 February 1891. The successful conclusion of these processes meant that the cause could be taken to the pope for his final approval. He was proclaimed to be Venerable on 21 July 1891 after Pope Leo XIII confirmed that Sulprizio had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Leo XIII proposed Sulprizio as an appropriate model for workers of all ages. The two miracles required for his beatification (or healings that came after petitions for his intercession) were investigated in their dioceses of origin. It was then subject to further investigation at the C.O.R. whose preparatory committee approved the miracle on 8 January 1963 as did a general one on 5 March; Pope John XXIII later approved the beatification just before his death and therefore could not celebrate the beatification. His successor Pope Paul VI beatified him on 1 December 1963 in Saint Peter's Basilica. The miracle required for his canonization was investigated in Taranto and Archbishop Filippo Santoro placed the case under diocesan examination in a process that spanned from 19 June 2015 until 11 July 2016. Following this process the documentation gathered was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome for additional medical and theological examination. The C.C.S. approved this miracle at their meeting held on 5 June 2018. Pope Francis confirmed this miracle on 8 June and confirmed that Sulprizio would be canonized on 14 October 2018. Canonization miracle The miracle that led to his canonization concerned a man who was injured in a motorbike accident who fell into a coma. One relic of Sulprizio was - at the request of his relations - placed in his hospital room. Almost a week later his parents were told he had made remarkable progress, and had awakened from his coma and not in a vegetative state as was believed.

Future development plans: up to 2020 (blue) and 2030 (blue dots) The Minsk tram network (–ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç—Ä–∞–º–≤–∞–π) is organised into 10 routes, integrated with the city's trolleybus, Metro and bus services. It uses a standard Russian broad gauge. Trams, initially using horse traction, have been operating in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, since 1892. At that time the entire territory was part of the Russian empire. Services were interrupted for a few years following the 1917 Russian Revolution and again during the Second World War. Minsk used horse trams for longer than many other cities, but a programme of tram electrification took place during the 1920s. Network The focus of the network is two sets of lines crossing through the city centre, with a small ring/loop section in the central district. There are five terminus turning loops at the ends of the lines (one of which splits shortly before reaching its western end points). There are also three terminus-style turning loops positioned approximately mid-way along a couple of the lines: these serve additional, shorter, routes. Tram fleet In recent years the network has been operated mainly by trams from the local manufacturer, Belkommunmash. Before that, most of the vehicles came from the Latvian RVR company, some of which have been rebuilt. The RVR-6 was introduced to the network in 1966 and by 1981 was said to have become the only tram type in regular use. 24 Tatra T6B5 trams were acquired in 1991, followed in 2003, by ten twenty year old GT8M tramcars from the city of Karlsruhe: the Germans handed over the trams for free, stating that this was cheaper than paying to scrap them, while the Belarusians were confident of being able to undertake cost-effectively the principal modification, which involved adapting the axles for the wider Russian gauge. The local Belkommunmash company is currently completing development of a low-floor fourth generation tram for the city: the first examples are currently in service on a test basis. History Horse trams The history of the tram network starts with the opening of a horse tram on 22 May 1892, following two years of construction by the \\"Company for city and suburb horse-railways in Minsk\\". This came in the wake of massive population growth, from 5,500 in the 1860s to 91,000 by the end of the century, and after several decades during which horse-drawn omnibus services had proliferated across the booming city. Horse trams were already well established in other major Russian cities, and were considered safer and more comfortable than the horse omnibuses at a time when city streets were generally unpaved. By 1900 a horse-tram line connected two of the principal main-line rail stations, and a slow process now began creating a wider network centred on this. In 1909 the network was taken over by the \\"Russian Company of Urban and Suburban trams\\" and in 1913 it was transferred into the ownership of the city authorities. Between May 1918 and 7 August 1921 the trams stopped, thanks to the First World War and the Civil War that followed the 1917 Russian Revolution. Electric trams A major upgrade, which some sources identify as the beginning of the modern tram network in Minsk, started on 20 January 1928 and concluded on 13 October 1929. This marked the formal opening of a new system, now using electrically powered trams. The old one meter gauge had been replaced with standard Russian broad gauge. At this stage there were two routes: * \\"Tovarnaya station\\" - \\"Komarovka\\" (¬´–¢–æ–≤–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è¬ª ‚Äî ¬´–ö–æ–º–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞¬ª) served 9 permanent tram halts and a further 4 request halts. * \\"Main station\\" - \\"Freedom Square\\" (¬´–í–æ–∫–∑–∞–ª¬ª ‚Äî ¬´–ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å –°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã¬ª) served 2 permanent tram halts and a further 1 request halt In 1929 approximately 18-19,000 passengers used the trams each day, and the tram cars were also being used for carrying freight. The early 1930s saw a steady expansion of the network. By 1934 the system had been extended further and was organised into seven routes, serviced by 6 tramcars over a total line distance of . In 1939 there were 70 tramcars for passengers and the total length of the tramlines had grown to . More war and its aftermath The trams stopped again with the German invasion in June 1941. Under occupation, one line was restarted in May 1943, but as the tide turned of war turned the trams stopped running again in June 1944, and the retreating German armies took with them substation equipment and blew up important tram infrastructure as they left. After the war it took some time for services to get back to normal. The post war years saw a big growth in motor bus and trolleybus operations in Minsk. In August 1951 the city sent 26 workers from the tram department to retrain as trolleybus drivers and in March 1952 the city's tram and trolleybus services were merged into a single operation. Nevertheless, work on extending the Minsk tram network also continued, and by there were tram routes totalling , serviced by 122 tramcars. A major investment in the 1960s funded a new tram depot, completed in 1966, with capacity for 250 tramcars, and there was also investment in electrically heated points for the tram network. Minsk Metro Work started on the Minsk Metro in 1977, and the first of its two lines opened in 1984. The second opened in 1990. On 30 June 1984 tram lines were removed from main streets in the busy centre of Minsk, and the tram network assumed the configuration which it currently (2015) retains.

The equation is as follows: d_L=(1+z)^2 d_A, where d_L is the luminosity distance and d_A the angular-diameter distance.  History and derivations  When Etherington introduced this equation in 1933, he mentioned that this equation was proposed by Tolman as a way to test a cosmological model. Ellis proposed a proof of this equation in the context of Riemannian geometry.G. F. R. Ellis, \\"Relativistic cosmology\\", Proceedings of the 47th International School of Physics \\"Enrico Fermi\\", edited by R. K. Sachs (Academic Press, New York and London), Vol. 15 (1971), pp. 104-182. A quote from Ellis: \\"The core of the reciprocity theorem is the fact that many geometric properties are invariant when the roles of the source and observer in astronomical observations are transposed\\". This statement is fundamental in the derivation of the reciprocity theorem.  Validation from astronomical observations  The Etherington's distance-duality equation has been validated from astronomical observations based on the X-ray surface brightness and the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel'dovich effect of galaxy clusters. The reciprocity theorem is considered to be true when photon number is conserved, gravity is described by a metric theory with photons traveling on unique null geodesics. Any violation of the distance duality would be attributed to exotic physics provided that astrophysical effects altering the cosmic distance measurements are well below the statistical errors. For instance, an incorrect modelling of the three- dimensional gas density profile in galaxy clusters may introduce systematic uncertainties in the determination of the cluster angular diameter distance from X-ray and/or SZ observations, thus altering the outcome of the distance- duality test. Similarly, unaccounted extinction from a diffuse dust component in the inter-galactic medium can affect the determination of luminosity distances and cause a violation of the distance-duality relation.

The historical name of Tiruneelakkudi is Thennalakudi . The presiding deity is Shiva. He is called as Neelakandeswarar. His consort is Oppilamulaiyal.  Significance  right It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Tirunavukkarasar. Praises of the temple have been sung by Sambandar in the Thevaram. The temple is also associated with the life of Thiruneelakanta Nayanar. Legend As per Hindu legend, when the celestial deities Devas and demons Asuras were churning the Ocean of Milk for ambrosia, poison emerged first. Shiva consumed the poison, but his wife Parvati held his throat as he was consuming it. It is believed that Shiva got the name Neelakanta from then on. Parvati anointed Shiva with oil in this place to relieve Neelankata of his pain. The practise of anointing the lingam in the temple continues in modern times where the whole oil is consumed by the image.Saiva, Pillai, Siva, 1999, p. 6 The lingam in the front hall of the central shrine is believed to have been worshipped by Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, to relieve him of the sins committed while coalescing with celestial dancer Urvasi.Saiva, Pillai, Siva, 1999, p. 7 Markendeya is believed to have worshipped the deity by carrying him in palanquin to attain long life. The Saptastanam festival is celebrated commemorating the event when the festival images of the seven neighbouring temples are brought to this temple. During the festival, the festive images of all the temples are carried around the streets of Tiruneelakudi. Kamadenu, the holy cow that emerged from churning the Ocean of Milk, is believed to have worshipped Neelakantar in this place to relieve itself of its curse from her master sage Vashista. Sage Durvasa, Devas and other sages have worshipped the presiding deity here.Saiva, Pillai, Siva, 1999, p. 8 Architecture The image of lingam is about high and has an unusual square projections and a rough surface. The ablution performed during the Chittirai festival with gingely oil is absorbed by the image. The Saiva saint Appar is believed to have worshipped and sung praises of the deity here while he was going to Thyagarajaswamy Temple, Tiruvarur. He describes the tortures he faced from his Jain counterparts.

He was a Member of Parliament for ƒ∞stanbul's second electoral district from the Democratic Left Party (DSP) from 1991 to 2002. He was also a Minister of State during the coalition government led by Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yƒ±lmaz between 1997 and 1999. Early life and career Of Circassian descent, √ñzkan was the youngest of seven children and was born in 1950 in the district of Develi, Kayseri. He was educated at Pertevniyal High School and graduated from Galatasaray School of Economics and Management (now Marmara University.http://www.kimkimdir.gen.tr/kimkimdir.php?id=425 In 1968, he was a contestant in the Golden Lantern Dance Competition along with T√ºlin Aktan and came first. His brother, Necdet √ñzkan, was elected as the Mayor of ƒ∞stanbul's Bayrampa≈üa district, after which he took over most of his family trade business.http://www.biyografi.info/kisi/husamettin-ozkan Political career √ñzkan joined the DSP in 1991 and became a Member of Parliament for ƒ∞stanbul's second electoral district in the 1991 general election. He was perceived to be close to the party's leader B√ºlent Ecevit. Minister of State Having been re-elected as a Member of Parliament in the 1995 general election, the DSP entered a triple coalition government along with the Motherland Party (ANAP) and Democrat Turkey Party (DTP). The DSP-DTP-ANAP coalition was formed after the coalition between the True Path Party and the Islamist Welfare Party broke down in 1997 as a result of the 1997 military memorandum. In the new coalition, ANAP leader Mesut Yƒ±lmaz became Prime Minister, while DSP leader B√ºlent Ecevit and DTP member ƒ∞smet Sezgin became Deputy Prime Ministers. In this new government, √ñzkan was made Minister of State. Deputy Prime Minister The ANAP-DSP-DTP coalition broke down in 1999 after the T√ºrkbank scandal, with Ecevit forming a DSP-only minority government until the 1999 general election. √ñzkan was made Deputy Prime Minister in this new government, serving alongside Hikmet Uluƒübay. During his time as Deputy, he dealt with issues such as the Capture of Abdullah √ñcalan, the leader of the Kurdish militant Kurdistan Workers' Party. The DSP polled the highest in the 1999 general election, with Ecevit forming a coalition with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the Motherland Party (ANAP). √ñzkan remained as Deputy Prime Minister, joined by the MHP's Devlet Bah√ßeli and ANAP's Mesut Yƒ±lmaz. During this government, he played a role in ensuring that the 2000 presidential election process did not result in parliamentary deadlock. New Turkey Party Concerns over Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit's health resulted in rumours that DSP politicians were plotting to oust him as leader. This led to √ñzkan, who was rumoured to be one of the dissident DSP parliamentarians, resigning from the DSP and becoming a co-founder of the New Turkey Party (YTP) along with ƒ∞smail Cem. Many DSP MPs also joined the party, with the YTP heading for a strong showing in the 2002 general election. However, organisational difficulties and the decision of party member Kemal Dervi≈ü to defect to the Republican People's Party (CHP) led to the YTP winning just 1.13% of the vote and falling far below the 10% election threshold needed to win representation in Parliament. As a result, √ñzkan resigned from the party and retired from active politics.http://husamettin-ozkan-kimdir.cix1.info Legal investigations In 2004, √ñzkan was investigated by Parliament over claims that he assisted in protecting individuals at Halk Bank and stopping them from being investigated, thus causing financial damage to the Bank. In 2007, he was found not guilty.

It is strongly believed that active galactic nuclei and pulsars have rotating magnetospheres, therefore, they potentially can drive charged particles to high and ultra-high energies. It is a proposed explanation for ultra-high- energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and extreme-energy cosmic rays (EECRs) exceeding the Greisen‚ÄìZatsepin‚ÄìKuzmin limit. Acceleration to high energies It is well known that the magnetospheres of AGNs and pulsars are characterized by strong magnetic fields that force charged particles to follow the field lines. If the magnetic field is rotating (which is the case for such astrophysical objects), the particles will inevitably undergo centrifugal acceleration. The pioneering work by Machabeli & Rogava was a thought experiment in which a bead moves inside a straight rotating pipe. Dynamics of the particle were analyzed both analytically and numerically and it was shown that if the rigid rotation is maintained for a sufficiently long time energy of the bead will asymptotically increase. In particular, Rieger & Mannheim, building on the theory of Machabeli & Rogava, showed that the Lorentz factor of the bead behaves as where gamma_0 is the initial Lorentz factor, Œ© is the angular velocity of rotation, r is the radial coordinate of the particle, and c is the speed of light. From this behavior it is evident that radial motion will exhibit a nontrivial character. In due course of motion the particle will reach the light cylinder surface (a hypothetical area where the linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light), leading to the increase of the poloidal component of velocity. On the other hand, the total velocity cannot exceed the speed of light, therefore, the radial component must decrease. This means that the centrifugal force changes its sign. As is seen from (), the Lorentz factor of the particle tends to infinity if the rigid rotation is maintained. This means that in reality the energy has to be limited by certain processes. Generally speaking, there are two major mechanisms: The inverse Compton scattering (ICS) and the so-called breakdown of the bead on the wire (BBW) mechanism. For jet-like structures in an AGN it has been shown that, for a wide range of inclination angles of field lines with respect to the rotation axis, ICS is the dominant mechanism efficiently limiting the maximum attainable Lorentz factors of electrons gamma_{ICS}^{max}sim 10^8. On the other hand, it was shown that the BBW becomes dominant for relatively low luminosity AGN L < 8times 10^{40}mathrm{erg}/mathrm{s}, leading to gamma_{BBW}^{max}sim 10^7. The centrifugal effects are more efficient in millisecond pulsars as the rotation rate is quite high. Osmanov & Rieger considered the centrifugal acceleration of charged particles in the light cylinder area of the Crab-like pulsars. It has been shown that electrons might achieve the Lorentz factors gamma_{KN}^{max}sim 10^7 via inverse Compton Klein‚ÄìNishina up-scattering. Acceleration to very high and ultra-high energies Although the direct centrifugal acceleration has limitations, as analysis shows the effects of rotation still might play an important role in the processes of acceleration of charged particles. Generally speaking, it is believed that the centrifugal relativistic effects may induce plasma waves, which under certain conditions might be unstable efficiently pumping energy from the background flow. On the second stage energy of wave-modes can be transformed into energy of plasma particles, leading to consequent acceleration. In rotating magnetospheres the centrifugal force acts differently in different locations, leading to generation of Langmuir waves, or plasma oscillations via the parametric instability. One can show that this mechanism efficiently works in the magnetospheres of AGN and pulsars. Considering Crab-like pulsars it has been shown that by means of the Landau damping the centrifugally induced electrostatic waves efficiently lose energy transferring it to electrons. It is found that energy gain by electrons is given by },}} where delta rsim c/Gamma, Gamma is the increment of the instability (for details see the cited article), F_{reac}approx2mcOmegaxi (r)^{-3}, xi (r) = left(1-Omega^2r^2/c^2right)^{1/2}, n_p is the plasma number density, m is the electron's mass and n_{_{GJ}} is the Goldreich-Julian density. One can show that for typical parameters of the Crab-like pulsars, the particles might gain energies of the order of 100s of TeVs or even PeVs. In case of millisecond newly born pulsars, the electrons might be accelerated to even higher energies of 10^{18}eV By examining the magnetospheres of AGNs, the acceleration of protons takes place through the Langmuir collapse. As it is shown this mechanism is strong enough to guarantee efficient acceleration of particles to ultra-high energies via the Langmuir damping :epsilon_pleft(eVright)approx 6.4times 10^{17}times M_8^{-5/2}times L_{42}^{5/2}, where L_{42}equiv L/10^{42}mathrm{erg}/mathrm{s} is the normalized luminosity of AGN, M_8equiv M/(10^8M_{odot}) is its normalized mass and M_{odot} is the Solar mass. As it is evident, for a convenient set of parameters one can achieve enormous energies of the order of 10^{21}eV, so AGNs become cosmic Zevatrons.

The Matsqui people are a Sto:lo Aboriginal group located in the Central Fraser Valley region of British Columbia, Canada. Their band government is the Matsqui First Nation, a member of the Sto:lo Nation tribal council. The core traditional territory of the Matsqui stretches along the Fraser River from Crescent Island to Sumas Mountain, and southward beyond the Canada-United States border. Today the band administers four reserves and has a population of 225 (which has been steadily growing over recent decades). Transformer Stories Ancient legendary stories (known as sxw√µxwiy√°m in the Halq'em√©ylem language) reveal the ancestors of the current Matsqui people to have occupied Matsqui territory from time immemorial. Like other Sto:lo communities, the Matsqui collectively inherited traits (or \\"gifts\\") from their shared legendary ancestors. Sto:lo sxw√µxwiy√°m describe how the Matsqui tribe was founded by a man named Sk-El√™'yitl who, along with his son, was transformed into Beaver by X√°:ls the legendary transformer. Beaver was responsible for ensuring that the sockeye salmon were available to all of the Sto:lo communities on the Fraser River, and was the first to bring fire to the Sto:lo people. Another sxw√µxwiy√°m explains the origins of a large transformer stone on the eastern edge of Aldergrove Regional Park. Known to the Matsqui as \\"M√©qel\\" (Halq'em√©ylem for \\"nose\\"), the stone was created by X√°:ls after witnessing a man who started sneezing when enemies were drawing near. X√°:ls was so impressed with this talent that he permanently transformed the man into the stone nose. History The Matsqui are closely related to the Nooksack people in Washington, and are notable as one of only two Sto:lo groups that were historically bilingual in the Halq'em√©ylem and Noocksack languages. Their bilingualism has much to do with the nature of Matsqui territory, which features a system of trails, streams, and lakes that connect the Fraser River to the Nooksack River in Washington. The word \\"Matsqui\\" (M√°thxwi) itself may be derived from m√°th, a root plant that grew in the large, easily traveled marshes that were once abundant in the Matsqui Prairie area. Settlements When the smallpox epidemic spread through Matsqui territory in 1782, its survivors likely consolidated their numbers in the settlements that were the most rich with resources and more easily defended against the coastal raiders. In 1808, the explorer Simon Fraser traveled down the Fraser River and recorded a village that may have been located at Matsqui. Estimating the population to be about 200 people, Fraser also took note of a massive longhouse, \\"640 feet long by 60 broad [...] under one roof.\\" Near the end of the nineteenth century, anthropologist Franz Boas recorded the name of a village on Matsqui Main Indian Reserve 2, \\"Ma'mak'ume [M√≥meqwem],\\" and noted that this was one of two Matsqui villages. Reserves In 1860, surveyor William McColl established a reserve for the Matsqui at M√≥meqwem. Amounting to 9600 acres, the Matsqui reserve was the largest reserve ever to be established in south coastal British Columbia. Within a decade, however, shifts in colonial policy worked to drastically reduce the size of reserves across the colony. In 1867, the Matsqui reserve was reduced to 80 acres, just 8% of the original allotment. In 1877, an American named Ellis Luther Derby began illegally constructing a dyke at the Matsqui Main reserve, where the majority of Matsqui people lived. Because the Matsqui relied on seasonal flooding to access important hunting and gathering sites, the imposition of the dyke on the reserve significantly disrupted their ability to access key parts of their traditional territory. Nonetheless, in 1879 the Joint Indian Reserve Commission conceded that Derby would be allowed to \\"keep the Dyke which goes through the Reserve fenced.\\" Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the nearby construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1885) and a spur line to Washington (1892) had opened new agricultural markets to the east and to the south. Around this period, the Matsqui‚Äîwhose historic economy was by now severely disrupted‚Äîadopted agricultural and horticultural activities on their reserve‚Äîkeeping cattle, sowing crops, and planting orchards‚Äîalongside historic practices like fishing. The remnants of the orchards‚Äîapple, plum, cherry, and pear trees‚Äîare still visible at Matsqui Main Reserve today.Malloway, Mary, Chief Alice McKay, Joan Silver. Interview with Tenille Campbell and Jesse Robertson. St√≥:l≈ç Research and Resource Management Centre Archive. Sardis, BC. May 14, 2015 By the early twentieth century, the government had expropriated significant portions of Matsqui Main Reserve for the BC Electric Railway (1910), Canadian National Railway (1915), and Glenmore Road. When the McKenna- McBride Royal Commission came to Matsqui in 1915, they recorded a population of forty people living in eleven homes. The following year, the Indian Agent responsible for Matsqui reported that the population‚Äînow thirty six‚Äîwas rapidly decreasing due to tuberculosis. The commission also received a testimony from Chief Charlie Matsqui. Chief Matsqui protested that the borders of his reserve had been significantly curtailed since 1860, and impinged upon by the BC Electric and CNR railways, without due compensation. The Chief's testimony reveals how the Matsqui may have understood these impositions and merits quoting at length: Work and education The arrival of miners and then thousands of settlers into Matsqui territory had devastating impacts on the Matsqui community. Most of their natural resources (forests, fish, wildlife, and lands) were being used and regulated by newcomers, their children were being taken to residential schools, and adult men and women were relegated to finding wage employment in only a few industries.Keith Thor Carlson and John Lutz, \\"Sto:lo People and the Wage Labour Economy,\\" in Carlson ed., You Are Asked to Witness: The Sto:lo In Canada's Pacific Coast History, (Chilliwack: Sto:lo Heritage Trust, 1997) But over the past century there has been remarkable improvements in Matsqui people's education attainment, success in lowering unemployment and finding ever more meaningful jobs, and now there are initiatives showing the success of Matsqui people in the field of business and self-governance.See for example, https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/haa/Docs/Matsqui_FRO.pdf Throughout the twentieth century, Matsqui have engaged in various kinds of employment on and off reserve. The income gained from such activities helped to supplement traditional practices like harvesting, hunting, and fishing, and more recent ones, such as raising cattle or growing potatoes. At the beginning of the century, the Matsqui often found work in fish canning facilities or hop yards. Later, Matsqui logged and planted trees, and harvested cascara bark on Three Islands reserve. They also found work picking berries in the Fraser Valley and on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Many Matsqui children attended St. Mary's Indian Residential School in Mission, where they sometimes encountered abuse and mistreatment. One of the apparent consequences of the school among the Matsqui was the steep decline in Halq‚Äôem√©ylem speakers between 1863 and 1965, the years the school was open. Today, most Matsqui youth attend public school in the Abbotsford School District. The Abbotsford School District currently delivers cultural awareness programming in accordance with partnerships that have been worked out with the Matsqui governing body and the neighbouring Sumas First Nation.See, for example, http://www.sd34.bc.ca/sites/default/files/Aboriginal%20Enhancement%20Agreement_09JUN22.pdf Matsqui students' education success rates have been steadily improving over the past generation. Later developments At the beginning of the twentieth century, most Matsqui people lived on the hill at Matsqui Main Reserve, where they were able to tend to their orchards and escape seasonal flooding. Later, however, as the dyke system improved, the Matsqui people increasingly began to move their houses to lower ground.Julian, Louis, Chief Alice McKay, Joan Silver, Brian Tommy. Interview with Tenille Campbell and Jesse Robertson. St√≥:l≈ç Research and Resource Management Centre Archive. Sardis, BC. May 28, 2015 Many Matsqui homes were flooded during the 1948 Fraser River flood. Matsqui member Joan Silver remembers the dyke breaking: \\"I remember seeing my Aunt Helen's house [...] I don't know how many days it was. All you could see was [...] their chimney.\\" In 1995 and 1996, many of the old orchards at Matsqui Main Reserve were leveled when the band leased a portion of the reserve to a sand and gravel extraction company.Malloway, Mary, Chief Alice McKay, Joan Silver. Interview with Tenille Campbell and Jesse Robertson. St√≥:l≈ç Research and Resource Management Centre Archive. Sardis, BC. May 19, 2015 The area of the extraction is now relatively flat, and covered with thin, deciduous trees. Part of the Matsqui Main Reserve is accessible to non-members via the Greater Vancouver Regional District Trail, which runs through the reserve and forms part of the larger Trans Canada Trail. In the summer of 2015, Matsqui completed the construction of a new Community Complex, complete with an Administration Building, Health Building and full size Gymnasium. Indian reserves Today the Matsqui First Nation administers four reserves: * Sahhacum - Matsqui Reserve #1, located east of Abbotsford, BC, and located on HWY 11 within the municipal boundaries of modern-day Abbotsford BC; * Matsqui Main - Matsqui Reserve #2, located on the left bank of the Fraser River, southwest of Mission, on the south banks of the Fraser River within the Municipal Boundaries of modern day Abbotsford, BC; * Three Islands - Matsqui Reserve #3, located in the Fraser River directly north of Matsqui Main in the District of modern day Mission, BC; * Aldergrove - Matsqui Reserve #4, located along the International Boundary that separates Canada and the United States of America, within the boundaries of modern day Township of Langley.

The faculty was formed in 2011 and has 2,000 members, who are Members (MFMLM) or accredited as Fellows in increasing seniority: Associate Fellow (AFFMLM), Fellow (FFMLM) or Senior Fellow (SFFMLM). History The faculty was established in October 2011 by all the medical royal colleges and faculties with endorsement from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). As a professional body for the setting and maintaining of standards, the faculty was seen as having an important role in helping medical leaders to be seen as skilled professionals rather than gifted amateurs. The faculty put forward the view that Medical leadership would have to become a true professional discipline to be able to deal with the challenges which the health service faces. The faculty have also commented on creating the right culture within organisations that provide healthcare and training. Governance The chief executive and medical director is Peter Lees. It is governed by a Board of Trustees and Council of members. While the organisation was becoming established, the faculty's governing body was the Founding Council, with representatives drawn from all of the member Colleges and Faculties. This arrangement was in place from May 2011 until March 2013, at which point the new Council took over. In January 2014, a Board of Trustees was established.

It was published on October 13, 2015, by Grand Central Publishing.  Synopsis  Colin is a troubled young man with a history of anger problems that stem from him being mercilessly bullied at the various military schools he's attended throughout the years and from parents who have little interest in parenting their child. These issues lead to repeated interactions with the police, to the point where Colin's parents have had enough and throw him out of the house. Maria, on the other hand, has always grown up in a warm and nurturing environment where people have supported her emotionally throughout her law career. Maria and Colin eventually meet one another and begin dating; however, soon Maria begins to receive strange and terrifying messages from an anonymous stalker. She believes that she knows who is sending the messages, causing her to fear for her and Colin's well-being. Reception The Washington Post panned See Me, criticizing the book's romance as \\"ho hum\\" and the reviewer stated that she \\"found [herself] wondering what was so mysterious about a workmanlike romance novel.\\" The Deccan Herald was mixed, as they enjoyed the See Me's romance and thrills but felt that \\"Colin‚Äôs workouts and fighting encounters tend to make the book bulkier, and a tad boring.\\" In contrast, the Salt Lake Tribune thoroughly praised the book and wrote that \\"Sparks takes readers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, from the soft tone of a love story to the adrenaline rush of a thriller.\\" References External links * 2015 American novels American romance novels Novels by Nicholas Sparks ","title":"See Me (novel)"},{"id":"47218865","text":"is a Japanese voice actor affiliated with Arts Vision.
