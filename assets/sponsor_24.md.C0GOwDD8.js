He was the Nationalist Movement Party presidential candidate for the 2007 presidential election, which he lost to the Justice and Development Party candidate Abdullah Gül. He served as a Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Kayseri from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2007 to 2011. Beginning his career as a bureaucrat, Çakmakoğlu served as the Kaymakam (sub-Governor) of numerous districts before being appointed the Deputy Governor of Ankara. Serving as Deputy Governor for three years, Çakmakoğlu then served as the 28th Governor of Gümüşhane from 1972 to 1975, as the 28th Governor of Isparta from 1975 to 1978, as the 27th Governor of Edirne from February to August 1978, as the 27th Governor of Gaziantep from 1979 to 1980 and finally as the 31st Governor of Mersin from 1984 to 1988. In 1991, he was appointed as the non- partisan Minister of the Interior due to the constitutional requirement for the partisan Interior minister to vacate his or her office three months before a general election and hand it over to the Undersecretary of the Interior Ministry. Çakmakoğlu served as the Interior Minister until a new government was formed after the 1991 general election. Early life and career Sabahattin Çakmakoğlu was born on 25 November 1930 in İncesu, Kayseri. Having received his primary and secondary education in Kayseri, he graduated from Ankara University Faculty of Political Science in 1953. He became a Civilian Administrative Officer and a candidate to become a Kaymakam (a district governor, roughly translated as a 'sub-governor'). During his time as a Kaymakam candidate, he also graduated from the Ankara University Faculty of Law. Bureaucratic career Kaymakam Çakmakoğlu spent 12 years serving as a Kaymakam in the districts of Kozaklı in Nevşehir Province, Gülşehir in Nevşehir Province, Ürgüp in Nevşehir Province, Çıldır in Ardahan Province, Bayburt in Gümüşhane Province and Ereğli in Konya Province. In 1989, the district of Bayburt became a Province in its own right. Governor Çakmakoğlu spent three years serving as the Deputy Governor of Ankara before being appointed as the 28th Governor of Gümüşhane from 1972 to 1975, as the 28th Governor of Isparta from 1975 to 1978, as the 27th Governor of Edirne from February to August 1978, as the 27th Governor of Gaziantep from 1979 to 1980 and finally as the 31st Governor of Mersin from 1984 to 1988. Undersecretary Between the years 1988 and 1992, Çakmakoğlu served in the General Directorate of Security, as the Undersecretary to the Prime Minister of Turkey and as the Undersecretary to the Minister of the Interior. In 1991, he was elected as a member of the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) from the Cabinet office contingency. In 1992, after retirement, he served as the chief advisor to the President of Turkey, at the time Turgut Özal. Minister of the Interior With the Constitution requiring that the serving partisan Ministers of the Interior, of Transport and of Justice should vacate their position to their respective Undersecretaries at least three months before a general election, Çakmakoğlu took over from Mustafa Kalemli as Minister of the Interior on 30 August 1991, three months before the 1991 general election. He remained as Minister until a new government was formed, being succeeded by İsmet Sezgin when the coalition government between the True Path Party and the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) on 21 November 1991. Political career Çakmakoğlu first entered politics in 1992 by joining the Motherland Party (ANAP), but left the party to join the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in 1995. He served as an advisor to MHP leader Alparslan Türkeş until his death in 1997. On 23 November 1997, Çakmakoğlu was elected to the MHP party council and later became a Deputy Leader of the MHP. He was elected to Parliament as an MHP MP from Kayseri in the 1999 general election. Minister of National Defense Following the 1999 general election, the Democratic Left Party (DSP), the Nationalist Movement Party and the Motherland Party formed a triple coalition government. Çakmakoğlu was subsequently appointed as the Minister of National Defense. He served in the position until 18 November 2002. He lost his seat in the 2002 general election due to the MHP falling below the 10% election threshold necessary to win parliamentary representation. Presidential candidacy The MHP managed to win parliamentary representation once again in the 2007 general election, with Çakmakoğlu again returning as an MP for Kayseri. He became a Deputy Leader of the MHP for a second time shortly after. The general election had been called early due to the parliamentary deadlock caused during the presidential election earlier that year. With the parliamentary process to elect a successor to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer resuming after the general election, the MHP put forward Çakmakoğlu as their presidential candidate. He won 70 votes in the first round, 71 in the second and 70 in the final round, losing to the Justice and Development Party candidate Abdullah Gül. Çakmakoğlu stepped down as an MP at the 2011 general election. Personal life Çakmakoğlu is married with two children. He has a secondary school named after him in his hometown of İncesu, Kayseri, namely Vali Sabahattin Çakmakoğlu Ortaokulu (Governor Sabahattin Çakmakoğlu Secondary School).http://vscakmakoglu.meb.k12.tr A primary school with the same name exists in Mersin Province, where Çakmakoğlu served as Governor between 1984 and 1988.http://mebk12.meb.gov.tr/meb_iys_dosyalar/33/14/713296/ See also *Devlet Bahçeli *Abdullah Gül *Turgut Özal *List of Turkish civil servants References External links *Biography on the Parliament website *Collection of all relevant news items at Haberler.com Nationalist Movement Party politicians Living people 1930 births Ankara University Faculty of Political Sciences alumni People from İncesu, Kayseri Ministers of National Defence of Turkey Members of the 21st Parliament of Turkey Members of the 23rd Parliament of Turkey Ministers of the Interior of Turkey Turkish civil servants Deputies of Kayseri ","title":"Sabahattin Çakmakoğlu"},{"id":"47206923","text":"Yuri Olegovich Ulyumdzhiyev (; born 20 December 1982) is a former Russian football player.

History The members of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) who opposed the reformist trend that ended being called \\"Eurocommunism\\" supported by the Central Committee of the PCE, and being in the situation of loss of organic link with his party, or even having been sanctioned, decided to create autonomous cells inside the party, but with their own political line. José Satué and Fernando Sagaseta were the leaders of the organization. In 1976 CC left the PCE because the party banned cell-type organization, considering that the upcoming legalization made that kind of organization an anachronism. CC left the party due to this decision. In 1977 CC participated in the coalition United Canarian People, that in 1979 became Canarian People's Union (UPC). UPC gained an MP in the legislative elections of 1979, Fernando Sagaseta, which was also a member of CC. In 1980-1981 the importance of CC declined and internal conflicts arose. In 1984 the majority of the party joined the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE), and (de facto) CC disappeared. In theory, CC never dissolved, but currently has no public activity.

Early life Molly Rose was born on 26 November 1920 in Cambridge, England. Her parents were David and Maude Marshall. Her father formed Marshall Motor Holdings and Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group. She had two older brothers, Arthur Marshall (b 4 December 1903) and Ronald (b 20 March 1906). Ronald died of meningitis in June 1907. With four older and one younger sister she was brought up in quite a lively household. Margery (b 1908), Dorothy (b 1910), Violet (b 1913), Mary (b 1916) and Brenda (b 1927). Her mother, Maude, died in 1930 when Molly was 10 years old and she and Brenda were, to all intents and purposes, brought up by their older sister Vi.

Having enjoyed flying as a passenger in her brother Arthur's de Havilland Gipsy Moth, it was unsurprising that in 1938 she passed her pilot's licence. Her father David Gregory Marshall (otherwise known as \\"DGM\\") had, by this time, developed the Marshall Motors business he set up in 1909 and her brother, Arthur, the Cambridge Flying School.

She was the stepmother and confidant of the author Maria Edgeworth. Early life Frances Anne Beaufort was born at Flower Hill in Navan, County Meath, in 1769. She was one of four children of Daniel Augustus Beaufort and Mary Beaufort (née Waller). Her brother was Admiral Francis Beaufort, and her sisters were the writers Harriet and Louisa. She was educated at Mrs Terson's School at Portarlington, learning writing, drawing, dancing and French. She studied art further under the English artist Bowring, Dublin-based Francis Robert West, and Raymond Deshouilleres of London. In 1788, she accompanied her father on a tour of Ireland, recording archaeological sites and objects. The family lived in London from 1789 to 1790. Later life On 31 May 1798, she married Richard Lovell Edgeworth, becoming his fourth wife and stepmother of Maria Edgeworth and her 11 siblings. Edgeworth and Maria, who was a year older than her stepmother, would become close to Maria, describing her as \\"her beloved friend and mother\\". There is evidence that Edgeworth was a writer like her sisters and stepdaughter, but her work was largely overlooked. A visitor to Edgeworthstown in 1813, James Hall, makes reference to her as a \\"successful\\" author, with a published novel, What You Choose to Call it or The Good Wife. This attribution was repeated in 1884, but is not mentioned by the family or their papers. It is known that Edgeworth wrote a memoir of Maria Edgeworth, containing selected letters. Some of Edgeworth's letters are held by the National Library of Ireland, and in the Bodleian Library. The Edgeworths went on to have six children together: Frances Maria Edgeworth (1799 – 4 February 1848), Harriet Edgeworth (1801–1889), Sophia Edgeworth (1803–1836), Lucy Jane Edgeworth (1805–1897), Francis Beaufort Edgeworth (1809–1846), and Michael Pakenham Edgeworth (24 May 1812 – 1881). Edgeworth died on 10 February 1865 at Edgeworthstown, County Longford. Amongst her grandchildren is the philosopher and political economist, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth. Artistic work Edgeworth was a contemporary of other botanical women artists of the time, such as Mary Delaney. Her father's biographer, Ellison, describes her as \\"an exceptionally talented artist in oils and crayons\\", though Edgeworth also worked in watercolour. She illustrated her father's 1792 A New Map of Ireland. After her marriage, Edgeworth helped in the illustration of her husband's engineering projects. She produced illustrations for Maria Edgeworth's The Parent's Assistant, which were used in the third edition. It was the production of these drawings that led to Richard Lovell Edgeworth and Frances meeting and subsequently marrying. The private collection at Edgeworthstown House holds an album containing some of these drawings. The Huntington Library in California has a volume of her botanical watercolours of plants from her home and around Ireland, dating from 1798 to 1807. These botanical paintings are of well-known plants from her home and surroundings and consist of 101 drawings. The drawings are very detailed and show a keen interest in botany. Edgeworth includes the Linnaean names, with her primary interest being in a complex group of plants, the Cryptogams.

He confessed to killing 18 women, and was convicted in 9 cases. The police believe that he raped at least 20 women in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. They also suspect that several of his crimes have not been reported, because the victims feared social stigma. Reddy has been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India, and is currently on death row.  Early life  Umesh Reddy was born BA Umesh in 1969, in Basappa Malige, a village in Chitradurga district, Karnataka. After being selected in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), he was posted in Jammu and Kashmir. While on duty as a guard at the house of a commandant, he attempted to rape the commandant's daughter. He then fled to Chitradurga district. In 1996, he managed to join the District Armed Reserve (DAR) Police, who were not aware of his background in CRPF. Reddy had been charged in a road rage incident, but the local DAR inspector chose to ignore this \\"petty case\\". Reddy completed his police training in Madhya Pradesh, and then returned to Karnataka.  Crimes  Reddy carefully selected his victims. He usually targeted housewives between 11 am and 3 pm, when there would be no men at home. He would gain entry into the victims' house on the pretext of asking for water or an address. He then threatened them with a knife, forced them to remove their clothes, tied them up, and raped them. He often choked his victims, and raped them while they were unconscious. After the rape, Reddy killed his victims, and removed their jewelry to make the crime appear like a robbery. He then escaped with the victim's undergarments. A transvestite, Reddy was found wearing women's lingerie under his clothes, whenever the police arrested him. In November 1996, Reddy attempted raping a high school girl, who was walking at KEB Colony in Chitradurga. The girl hit him with a stone, and managed to escape. On 6 December 1996, Reddy allegedly raped and murdered 16-year old Roopa, when she was returning to her house in the same locality. The next month, he was arrested and dismissed from service, when his first victim identified him at a Republic Day police parade by chance. Reddy, along with four others, was charged with Roopa's murder, and remanded to judicial custody (later, in 2004, he was acquitted in this case due to lack of sufficient evidence). A court asked him to be shifted to Bellary jail. In March 1997, while the Chitradurga police were handing him over to the Bellary prison authorities, Reddy escaped. He then killed an income tax officer's wife in Bangalore, a girl in Ahmedabad, two girls in Baroda and a widow in Kunigal. Reddy would steal lingerie put up for drying in the backyards of houses. On 7 July 1997, he was arrested by Peenya police for stealing women's undergarments. When the police raided his room, they recovered a gunny bag full of lingerie. At the time of his arrest in Peenya, he told the police that his name was \\"Ramesh\\". Reddy escaped within 24 hours, while being transferred to the MICO Layout police station for interrogation in another case. The police initially tried to hush up his escape, but Reddy's father filed a habeas corpus petition in the High Court. Two police personnel were then suspended, and a lookout notice was issued in the name of Ramesh. On 28 February 1998, Reddy raped and murdered 37-year-old widow Jayashree Maradi Subbaiah in Peenya. The police believe that he repeatedly had sex with the dead body. When her 8-year-old son Suresh returned from school, he saw Reddy in his house. Reddy told the boy that an evil spirit had entered his mother's body, so he had tied her to the window grill. He then fled saying that he was going to get a doctor. Reddy then attempted to rape another woman in Peenya. When the woman raised the alarm, he tried to escape by jumping from the first floor of the house. He sprained his ankle, and was caught by the neighbours, who handed him over to the police. In 1999, Reddy once again escaped from the police custody near Hirekerur. Before he could commit any crime, he was arrested by inspector Nyame Gowda, in Chikkaballapur. On the night of 3–4 March 2002, Reddy escaped from police custody again, while being transferred from Bellary to Bangalore in a KSRTC bus. The District Armed Reserve (DAR) personnel of Bellary, who accompanied him, claimed that he was handcuffed at the time, but Reddy denied this when he was arrested two months later. He stated that he bought rum and chicken for the policemen, and earned their trust. When the bus stopped at a dhaba near Hiriyur bypass, he requested the policemen to remove his handcuffs on the pretext that he needed to answer the call of nature. Once free, he ran into the fields and escaped. Over the next two months, Reddy raped three girls in Davangere, Hubli-Dharwad and Pune. He also stole three mobile phones and two credit cards. He worked as a waiter in a Pune hotel. He stole cash and clothes from there, and then fled to Dharwad. On 17 May 2002, Reddy arrived in Bangalore from Tumkur, and left his luggage in the cloakroom at the Yeshwanthpur railway station. Around 8 am, he visited a salon in Yeshwanthpur area, to get a haircut and a clean shave. As he entered the salon, an auto-rickshaw driver Sathyavelu recognized him from a newspaper photograph and an earlier court appearance. The driver called his elder brother Rajendran from a telephone booth, and asked him to fetch the police. Meanwhile, he kept a vigil outside the salon. When Reddy exited the salon and started walking towards the railway station, Sathyavelu tipped off the police and followed him. Inspector Nagaraja Urs intercepted Reddy near Sharief Nagar and arrested him. At first Reddy claimed to be somebody else, but admitted that he was the serial killer, after being taken to the police station. The police rewarded the driver with 20,000. Reddy was found wearing a bra and panties. His baggage, seized from the cloakroom, contained several women's garments: 18 pairs of panties, 10 bras, 8 churidars, 6 saris, 4 blouses and 2 nighties.  Death sentence  Reddy was tried and convicted in 9 cases, including rape of Jayashree Subbaiah. He was acquitted in 11 cases due to lack of sufficient evidence. On 26 October 2006, Judge K Sukanya of the Bangalore city fast-track court gave him multiple sentences including a death sentence, a 7-year sentence plus 25,000 fine and a 10-year sentence plus 25,000 fine. Reddy tried to win the judge's mercy by saying that he wanted to study and take care of his mother, but the judge did not relent. Since the death sentence was the heaviest sentence, the case was referred to the High Court as per procedure. On 4 October 2007, a division bench of the Karnataka High Court also convicted Reddy, but the judges differed on death sentence. Justice V G Sabhahit upheld the death penalty, but Justice Ravi B Naik advocated rigorous imprisonment for life with no scope for amnesty. A third judge, Justice S. R. Bannurmath, was appointed to resolve the tie. On 18 February 2009, Bannurmath upheld the death sentence, and thus, the High Court confirmed death penalty for Umesh Reddy. On 1 February 2011, the Supreme Court also upheld the death sentence.

Reddy immediately filed a mercy petition before the President of India. On 7 May 2012, the Government of Karnataka rejected Reddy's mercy plea. Subsequently, the President of India also rejected his mercy petition on 12 May 2013. Reddy then filed a fresh petition, which is now pending before a Supreme Court constitution bench.

It was released as a single on MGM Records in 1956. Background By 1956, rock and roll artists like Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry had taken the youth culture by storm, and country music would spend the next decade trying to adjust accordingly. However, in the face of the rock and roll tidal wave, Hank Williams was still selling. In fact, many of the new rock and roll artists, such as Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, greatly admired the late country singer's work, and his songs were still being recorded by artists from all genres, especially country artists. To keep up with the demand, MGM continued releasing singles from what it had left in its archives. \\"California Zephyr\\" had been one of the songs Williams sang on his radio show for Mother's Best Flour recorded in Nashville between January and March 1950. The surviving recordings of these shows feature more than forty songs that Hank never otherwise recorded. The shows present a far different side of Williams than the dark figure that has become ingrained into his legend, as biographer Colin Escott notes: \\"He's very unguarded, believing that no one aside from early morning listeners in and around Nashville and mid-Alabama would ever hear him. He laughs a lot, sometimes almost giggles, reminding us that he was only twenty-seven. The jokes are usually self-deprecating and the hymns are riveting.\\" \\"California Zephyr\\" is likely Hank's take on the popular \\"Wabash Cannonball,\\" made famous by his hero Roy Acuff; the melody and references to American cities and towns is strikingly similar. The recording on the single was taken from a 1951 demo and was issued as a 78 in 1956 with \\"Thy Burdens Are Greater than Mine\\" as the B-side.

Elevated to the Peerage of Ireland, his debauchery and reckless spending led him to sell the family estate. Life The son of Sir Richard Meade, 3rd Baronet, he was born a few days before his father's death. He inherited a baronetcy and estates worth about £10,000 per year, in County Cork, County Kilkenny, and County Tipperary. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Banagher in 1764. In 1765, he married Theodosia Magill, a wealthy heiress with estates in Gilford and Rathfriland, County Down, worth £4,000 per year. The marriage settlement provided her with a jointure of £3,500 per year should she survive Meade, of which £2,500 was to be charged to his Tipperary estates. On 17 November 1766, he was created Viscount Clanwilliam and Baron Gilford in the Peerage of Ireland, and entered the Irish House of Lords. The couple had five sons and five daughters: *Richard Meade, 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam (1766–1805) *Lady Anne Meade (24 April 1768 – 1826), married William Whaley, second son of Richard Chapell Whaley, in 1788 *Lady Catherine Meade (7 October 1770 – 17 February 1793), married Richard Wingfield, 4th Viscount Powerscourt in 1789 *Hon. Robert Meade (1772–1852), was briefly (1813-1814) the acting governor of the Cape Colony *Lady Theodosia Sarah Frances Meade (1773 – 13 December 1853), married John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden *Hon.

Edward Meade (d. 8 March 1801), educated at Wadham College, Oxford, 40th Regiment of Foot, killed at the Battle of Abukir, posthumously promoted lieutenant in the 23rd Regiment of Foot *Lady Melosina Adelaide Meade (d. 26 March 1866), married The 10th Earl of Meath *Lady Maria Rose Arabella Sarah Meade (1782 – 7 February 1876) The Clanwilliams were extravagant spenders, the Viscount dissipating large sums on horseracing, gambling, and keeping mistresses. (In 1779, Horace Walpole repeated a rumor, almost certainly exaggerated, that Clanwilliam had arranged the murder of one of his romantic rivals.) His elevation in the peerage as Earl of Clanwilliam on 20 July 1776 probably exacerbated matters, encouraging acts of ostentation like keeping open house at his townhouse (now part of Newman House) on St Stephen's Green, Dublin. Around 1783, the Clanwilliams' personal property was seized and auctioned; by 1787, his debts had grown to over £72,135. Lord Clanwilliam was forced to sell and mortgage his Cork and Kilkenny estates to pay off the debts; they were also charged with providing marriage portions for his daughters Anne and Catherine in 1788 and 1789. As these estates had provided maintenance for his eldest son Lord Gilford; Gilford was given £1,700 per year from the Tipperary and Down estates instead. The debt still stood at £31,327 in 1791, and grew to £46,251 in 1795. Clanwilliam found himself obliged to begin liquidating the Tipperary estate in 1793, a process that continued until 1805, at the cost of providing portions for his remaining younger children. Gilford's consent was needed to break the entail, but as he had contracted debts of his own and married the Bohemian, Roman Catholic, noblewoman Countess Caroline Thun without the approval of his parents in October 1793, he was in no position to obstruct them. He was granted a small provision from his mother's Down estates and left to live in Vienna. In fact, the resettlement of the family estates that ensued was largely to the benefit of the Countess, at the expense of the Earl and Lord Gilford. By September 1800, Clanwilliam suffered badly from dropsy and left his wife at Gill Hall, on the Gilford estate, for his mistress and his Dublin townhouse. He died there on 19 October, having, in the words of his grandson, The 3rd Earl of Clanwilliam, \\"dissipated, to the last guinea, the Meade estates in Cork and Tipperary\\".

Biography  He was the son of a gilder and painter who later fell ill during a period of employment in Poland and, afterward, could barely find enough work to support his large family. Following several moves, his father found work as a drawing teacher in Žatec. By that time, his parents realized that they could not provide him with a decent education in the arts, so they asked an old friend, the painter Joseph von Führich, to help get him enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. This was achieved, and the family moved there in 1830.Biography by Constantin von Wurzbach @ German WikiSource. Four years later, his father's health had deteriorated to the point that he could barely work, so Wilhelm had to leave the academy and find work as a fabric designer to provide support. Pilgrims (c.1845-50) Shortly after, a local priest who had heard of his talent hired him to paint images at the church in Kozly, which resulted in further commissions, generally done in conjunction with older artists, including panoramic views of Prague and commemorative drawings for the coronation of Ferdinand as King of Bohemia in 1836. This allowed him to continue his studies and, after his father's death in 1837, be sole support for his family. His career painting frescoes began when Eduard Gurk, the Habsburg's court painter, arranged for him and Antonín Lhota to paint the staircase of the grand tower at Karlštejn Castle. He was then selected for further training in fresco work by Johann Baptist Müller (1809-1869) and . In the 1840s, he made a lengthy trip to Italy, courtesy of a stipend from private sources. While in Rome, Ambassador allowed him to stay at the embassy. He also met with, and came under the influence of, Friedrich Overbeck and other members of the Nazarene movement. He remained in Italy, studying and working, until 1850, despite events related to the Revolutions of 1848 and his possible involvement as a citizen of the Austrian Empire. Upon his return to Austria, he gave a small exhibition at Hofburg Palace of the works he had created in Italy. He remained in Vienna for several months, then went to Prague and held another exhibition at Wallenstein Palace, as part of a benefit for the military hospital in Karlovy Vary. View of Rome with St. Peter's Basilica (1872, based on a painting from 1850) Although his works were critically acclaimed, new orders were slow in coming, so he planned to go back to Rome. This changed after King Ferdinand saw some of his paintings and hired him to help restore the chapel at Reichstadt Castle in Zákupy. This encouraged further commissions for frescoes and paintings (mostly of a religious nature) so Kandler was able to remain in Prague until his death. In addition to his paintings, he wrote a series of articles for the quarterly journal Libussa (published from 1842 to 1860), mostly dealing with his experiences in Italy and aspects of Italian culture. The journal's last few issues featured a series of his letters from Rome. He also illustrated several books; notably Das Böhmerland, a series of travel sketches by Siegfried Kapper.

Life He was the eldest son of John Meade, 1st Earl of Clanwilliam and his wife, the heiress Theodosia Magill. In October 1793, while Gilford was abroad on the Continent, his mother announced him as a candidate for a by-election in Down, apparently seeking an electoral pact with the Marquess of Downshire, who had just vacated the seat. Ultimately, his candidacy was withdrawn and Downshire's candidate was elected unopposed. Meanwhile, Gilford was laying the foundations for a family rupture. He fell in love with and married Caroline, Countess of Thun (19 May 1769 – 1800), daughter of Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein, on 16 October 1793. Marriage to a penniless Roman Catholic noblewoman was unacceptable in his Ascendancy family, and the marriage estranged him from his parents, who, at the time, were liquidating his father's estates to pay the enormous debts they had accumulated. His consent was necessary to break the entail, but as he had his own debts and a newborn daughter to provide for, he was obliged to agree to the sale of his patrimony. The couple returned from Ireland to Vienna in 1795 or 1796, where they ultimately had three children: *Caroline Meade, Countess Széchenyi (1794–1820), married Pál Széchenyi, elder son of Ferenc Széchényi *Richard Meade, 3rd Earl of Clanwilliam (1795–1879) *Selina Meade, Countess Clam-Martinic (1797–1872) married Karl Johann Nepomuk, Count of Clam- Martinic (1792–1840) In October 1800, Gilford's father died and he became Earl of Clanwilliam, and he briefly returned to Ireland. His wife died shortly thereafter. He realized little in the way of an inheritance: he was left the Gill Hall estate in Gilford, County Down, part of his mother's inheritance, but part of her jointure was still charged on its revenues, and her more valuable estate in Rathfriland went to his younger brother Hon. Robert Meade instead. He spent the rest of his life in Vienna, where he was an avid gardener; while manuring a flowerbed, he contracted an infection that killed him on 3 September 1805. After his death, his two daughters were raised by their aunt Maria Christiane and her husband Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky, while his son was raised in England.

Fast cementing their place as serious contenders on the UK hardcore scene, the band’s apparently limitless energy translates effortlessly into a record that’s as raw as it is powerful, with ferocious vocals from frontman Phil Cross leading the relentless onslaught. With lead single powerhouse ‘Trails’ already attracting an impressive following, Continents’ reputation looks set to rocket on the merit of this solid debut effort. While Rhian Westbury from Bring The Noise UK gave the album a 9/10, stating: 'Pegasus, Pegasus is where the band come into their own, from the opening massive riffs to the closing screams you won’t be able to sit still.

Coupons can be designed custom for a PWB or selected from a vendor library.  Overview  A coupon is designed to include traces and vias with the same dimensions and structures as those of the main PWB. It is standard practice to locate coupons on the edges of a panel, from which multiple PWBs are fabricated, to verify the consistency of plating, etching, and lamination across the whole panel.

The Act defines trademarks as \\"any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof\\" used by any person \\"to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.\\" A trademark is considered \\"distinctive and capable of being protected\\" if it \\"either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2) has acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 769 (citing § 13, pp. 37–38, and Comment a (Tent.

Initial lawsuit In 1978, Taco Cabana, Inc. began operating a chain of Mexican-style fast-food restaurants in San Antonio, Texas.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765. Taco Cabana described the decor of their restaurants as \\"a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The interior of the restaurants featured a \\"patio capable of being sealed off from the outside patio by overhead garage doors.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765 (stating that \\"[b]right awnings and umbrellas continue the theme\\") (internal quotations and citations omitted). In December 1985, Two Pesos, Inc. opened a restaurant in Houston, Texas with a trade dress similar to the one used in Taco Cabana's restaurants. Two Pesos' operations expanded rapidly, but the chain never opened a restaurant in San Antonio. However, in 1986, Taco Cabana opened restaurants in Houston and other markets in Texas where Two Pesos operated restaurants. One year later, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in federal district court for trade dress infringement under the Lanham Act and for theft of trade secrets under Texas common law.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765–66. Both the district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed that Two Pesos deliberately infringed upon Taco Cabana's trade dress, and Two Pesos appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.Two Pesos, Inc., (granting certiorari in part). Opinion of the Court A Taco Cabana location in Dallas, Texas Writing for the majority of the Court, Justice Byron White held that a distinctive trade dress is generally entitled to protection under the Lanham Act because users of a trade dress \\"should be able to maintain what competitive position it has and continue to seek wider identification among potential customers.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 771. Justice White noted that trade dresses, \\"even if not registered, remain inherently capable of distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 772. Additionally, a business owner that copies a trade dress \\"may be seen as falsely claiming that his products may for some reason be thought of as originating from the plaintiff.\\" Justice White also held that the Lanham Act did not include a secondary meaning requirement for trade dress, concluding that \\"a secondary meaning requirement for a nondescriptive trade dress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer's competitive position.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 774. Furthermore, he concluded that a secondary meaning requirement would have anticompetitive effects because a competitor could \\"appropriate the originator's dress in other markets\\" prior to the establishment of the secondary meaning and \\"deter the originator from expanding into and competing in these areas.\\"Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 775. Consequently, the Court ordered Two Pesos to pay $3.7 million in damages to Taco Cabana. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring opinion,Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 776 (Scalia, J., concurring). while Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote opinions concurring in the judgment.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 776, 785 (Stevens, J. and Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). Subsequent developments In November 1992, Taco Cabana filed another lawsuit against Two Pesos seeking $5 million in damages for not complying with the Supreme Court's ruling and for creating further confusion among customers. Two months later, Taco Cabana agreed to buy Two Pesos' assets for approximately $22 million. Richard Cervera, president and chief executive officer of Taco Cabana, stated that converting Two Pesos' restaurants to Taco Cabana restaurants would be “aided by the very striking physical resemblance of the two chains.”Jamison Dean Newberg, The Same Old Enchilada?

He took over the club from Richie Dixon on 27 June 2002 when Dixon was appointed the SRU's Head of Coach Development. Rugby union career Amateur career Searancke played for Te Awamutu OB, Hamilton Marist and Eastern Suburbs.http://www.rugbyhistory.co.nz/player/i-kiwi-searancke Provincial career Searancke was a prop for Waikato.http://www.theroar.com.au/2017/03/10/sending-player-off-always-ruins- game-rugby/ Coaching career =Waikato and New Zealand= He was a coach of Waikato Rugby and was also involved in developing New Zealand's young rugby talent as a national under-21 selector and a coach of the New Zealand Nike Youth Team. =Glasgow Warriors= The SRU's Director of Rugby Jim Telfer stated that he was keen for the Glasgow players to experience different styles of coaching in bringing in Searancke. He appointed Steve Anderson, previously the Australian National rugby league assistant coach, as Searancke's assistant. Also kept on as assistant was Gordon Macpherson. Telfer and Dixon were embarrassed by the fitness of the Glasgow players returning from their holidays to start their pre-season training. A good few of the players were out of condition and two Scotland international forwards laboured on a 3 km run in Dalziel Country Park. The professional players had previously been given a fitness programme to follow in the close season in an effort to match Super12 physical standards. Searancke was to bring in a toughness to managing the squad who he felt were under-performing. Not surprisingly though his uncompromising attitude ruffled many of the Glasgow players and soon there was a split in the dressing room between players and management. Searancke's time in charge of the Glasgow side is named as ninth in the top 10 coaching disasters in the book Rugby Top 10 of Everything. It remarks: \\"He was critical of his players too often. Almost weekly Searancke would publicly remark about their poor basic skills and questionable attitudes\\". Yet Searancke often blamed himself rather than the players; lamenting on a poor decision by Gordon Bulloch which cost Glasgow the game against Ulster he said \\"It boiled down to the fact that we had not discussed the scoring permutations and the tie-break situation. It is something the coaches should have sorted out with the players earlier in the week. It didn't happen - so that was a mistake of mine.\\" His fiery nature wasn't helped weeks later when Glasgow were thumped in the Heineken Cup 45-3 by Sale. This led to a public shouting match in the team room at Glasgow's Manchester hotel between Searancke and Glasgow's marketing manager Graham Clarke when Clarke picked the wrong time to ask Searancke to sign a shirt. \\"If you don't leave here, I'll punch you in the face\\" was the response. Searancke was to receive an official warning by the club for his behaviour. Telfer met Glasgow's senior players to assess the mood before reaching the decision with Glasgow that Searancke and Macpherson had to go. Anderson was moved to the SRU to help with Elite Development. At the time Telfer noted that Searancke's appointment at Glasgow was a mistake. However in his autobiography 'Looking back... for once' he states that he regretted the sacking as Searancke identified limitations in terms of the players' standards and their ability to push themselves to the levels required to be consistently competitive. This was backed by outgoing Glasgow player Jason White who stated that a lot of the problems were with the players. =Back to New Zealand= Searancke left Glasgow Warriors on 1 April 2003 and shortly afterwards got a job back in New Zealand coaching Poverty Bay rugby club. During that tenure as head coach he took Poverty Bay from the mid ranks of the division to win that division within a season Searancke became a coach of the Black Ferns.https://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-importance-maori-culture- stressedhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay- today/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503460&objectid;=10931593 References External links * Road to Nowhere *Searancke leaves Glasgow Living people Year of birth uncertain 1952 births New Zealand rugby union coaches Scottish rugby union coaches Glasgow Warriors coaches ","title":"Kiwi Searancke"},{"id":"47207742","title":"Nai Nabhannu La"},{"id":"47207767","text":"Franco Chino (born 27 September 1948) is a retired Italian backstroke swimmer.

It is located in the north west corner of the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on the grounds of old Camp Kearney (1917) and Camp Elliott (1942). Miramar National Cemetery is considered an auxiliary of the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and is administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The cemetery is located about north of Downtown San Diego on Nobel Drive between Miramar Road and Interstate 805. History On 30 January 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs dedicated a new National Cemetery at the northwest corner of MCAS Miramar.; The cemetery is an extension of Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and when complete will accommodate the remains of approximately 235,000 veterans and spouses. Nearby Fort Rosecrans Cemetery closed to most casket burials in 1966, and prior to Miramar's opening, the only option for casket burials of San Diego region veterans was Riverside National Cemetery. The cemetery design is sensitive to environmental considerations, preserving habitat for endangered California gnatcatchers and fairy shrimp. The first interment occurred in November 2010; the first casket burial occurred in April 2011. The cemetery contains 313 acres dedicated for full casket burials and cremated remains. It has 16 designated areas (not all currently being used) for full casket burials and two Columbarium areas for urn interments. It also has two, \\"Committal Service Shelters\\" or open sided covered shelters. North of the central \\"Avenue of Flags\\" is a \\"Memorial Walk\\" with dedications and benches for reflections.

Eligibility Burial in Miramar National Cemetery is available for eligible veterans, their spouses and dependents at no cost to the family and includes the gravesite, grave-liner, opening and closing of the grave, a headstone or marker, and perpetual care as part of a national shrine. For veterans, benefits may also include a burial flag (with case for active duty), and military funeral honors. Family members and other loved ones of deceased veterans may request Presidential Memorial Certificates. Veterans discharged from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable and servicemembers who die while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, as well as spouses and dependent children of veterans and active duty servicemembers, may be eligible for VA burial and memorial benefits including burial in a national cemetery. The veteran does not have to die before a spouse or dependent child can be eligible. Reservists and National Guard members, as well as their spouses and dependent children, are eligible if they were entitled to retired pay at the time of death, or would have been upon reaching requisite age. Burial of dependent children is limited to unmarried children under 21 years of age, or under 23 years of age if a full-time student at an approved educational institution. Unmarried adult children who become physically or mentally disabled and incapable of self- support before age 21, or age 23 if a full-time student, also are eligible for burial. A Federal law passed in 2010 (Public Law 111-275) extends burial benefits to certain parents of servicemembers who die as a result of hostile activity or from combat training-related injuries who are buried in a national cemetery in a gravesite with available space. The biological or adopted parents of a servicemember who dies in combat or while performing training in preparation for a combat mission, leaving no surviving spouse or dependent child, may be buried with the deceased servicemember if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that there is available space. The law applies to servicemembers who died on or after Oct. 7, 2001 and to parents who died on or after Oct. 13, 2010.

The Avenue extends from near the cemetery entrance eastward toward a giant American flag and flagpole at the east end of the roadway at the Flag Assembly Area. It was dedicated on Saturday 28 January 2012 with North San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn, Officers of the United States Armed Forces, representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs and numerous San Diego and Orange County veterans groups. It was hosted by the Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Support Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, with assistance from a US Marine Corps color guard and band from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Support Foundation takes care of flag replacement and repair. It was instrumental in the equipment, purchase and volunteer installation of the flagpoles with proper lighting. Volunteers provide about 1,000 hours of labor by digging trenches, assembling and landscaping. Noteworthy volunteers come from the Boy Scouts of America and Young Marines. They were joined by volunteers from the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and many civilians.

And recent year the family also established lord nagula statue near putta on top of mountain Location The fort, located on the Ramagiri hills, is near the Begumpet village in Kamanpur mandal in Peddapalli district. The fort was built within a thickly forested area that has a wealth of plant species, including many medicinal herbs. The fort is away from Peddapalli, the district headquarters. The Peddapalli – Manthani highway passes close to the fort, which is away from the Begumpet village. History The fort was built in the 12th century by the Kakatiyas of Warangal. Later, it was controlled by the Qutub Sahi Sultanate from 1518 to 1687. In 1656, the ruler of Golconda, Abdullah Qutb Shah, gave the fort to his son-in-law, one of Aurangzeb's sons. The fort came under the control of the British Raj in 1791. Tradition has it that Kalidasa, one of the greatest Sanskrit poets, was motivated to compose his Meghadūta, a lyrical poem, by the Ramagiri Fort; however, Kalidasa is thought to have lived in the fifth century CE, well before the fort's construction. Features View from the Ramagari Fort Built in stone, the fort has many bastions and occupies a large area of a few square kilometres. The bastions are in octagonal shape. The fort had been fitted with four forge-welded cannons on the masonry battlements built to a height of as part of the fort walls. It has been noted that the mud plaster that covered some of the structures in thick layers was a combination of mud, lime, reeds, hair of animals, or even blood of animals. Herbal plants The Ramagiri forest in the area of the fort is an important source for medicinal plants. Large numbers of local medicinal people collect the plants and offer them for sale in nearby towns. Students also visit the area to identify these plants and make herbarium specimens. In view of this importance for medicinal plants, it has been suggested that the forest of the fort area be declared a Medicinal Plants Conservation Center.

History Construction took place in 1702–1717 using designs by Carlo Fontana, and completed by Alessandro Cecchini. The palace was commissioned by the marchese Alessandro Capponi, on the street then called via San Sebastiano. The architect Ferdinando Ruggieri may have contributed to refurbishment in later years. The Gardens were commissioned in 1740 by the sons of Capponi (Scipione and Francesco Maria). In 1788 the palace was inherited by Pier Roberto Capponi and later his son, Gino Capponi, a 19th-century Italian statesman and historian. Subsequently, the palace came to be owned in 1920 by the art collector Egisto Paolo Fabbri. The interior has a theatrical entry staircase in pietra serena with a ceiling frescoed with an Allegory of Triumph. The well has a grotto-like fountain with nymph statues.

He has been an unsuccessful candidate in several Florida state legislature elections, and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2016 election. He was also the Reform Party's nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election. Steinberg has been practicing law for over 30 years, and his firm, Michael Steinberg & Associates, provides legal services to clients in social security, veteran's compensation, long-term disability insurance, and state disability matters. The Tampa Bay Times cited him saying that the aging population of Tampa Bay and the area's declining economy were the cause of an increase in local legal claims. Between 2008 and 2009, the 21 percent increase in social security disability legal claims in Tampa Bay broke the nationwide record. In 2014, his wife Miriam ran for a Florida state legislature seat in District 64, where he had run unsuccessfully in 2002. Background Steinberg married his wife Miriam in 1984. Miriam is originally from Israel. The two have three adult daughters. He is a member of a Conservative synagogue in Tampa, Florida. Steinberg received his bachelor's degree in economics and a J.D. degree from the University of Florida. In addition to his career as an attorney practicing social security law, he has served on the Florida Bar Association's military law subcommittee. Political involvement 2002 Florida state legislature election In 2002, Steinberg ran for election for the Florida state legislature in District 64; his candidacy was endorsed by the St. Petersburg Times. Two months after losing the election, Steinberg filed a lawsuit against the state Republican party for push polling against him in the election. The Florida Republican Party hired Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based polling company, to survey voters across the state. Towson Fraser, spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida at the time, denied that his party used push polls. Steinberg ran again for this seat in 2010, and lost. 2006 congressional election In 2006, Steinberg received 1,334 votes (3.4% of the popular vote) in the Democratic primary race for Florida's 11th congressional district. 2014 wife's candidacy When his wife, Miriam Steinberg, was running for office in 2014, he filed a lawsuit to disqualify a competing write-in candidate. Although the lawsuit was successful, the election was ruled invalid, and the seat was vacant until a special election could be held. As a result, J. W. Grant, who was out of office for a period, was automatically the winner of the election despite having reached his term limit. Miriam lost the election to Grant by a 59:40 margin. It was later ruled that write-in candidate should not have been disqualified, and subsequently, the election was ruled unconstitutional and the Florida legislature voted not to accept the result. Miriam then failed to file new fees to run again against Grant in a special election; although Michael filed a claim against the Florida Election Commission disputing the fee requirement. This resulted in Grant's only opponent being a write-in candidate. No write-in candidate has ever won an election in Florida. Grant was about to be running up against a Florida term limit law, but because the regular election was ruled invalid the seat was vacant for most of 2015 legislative session.Tampa Bay Times addresses Michael 2016 presidential election campaign Steinberg filed papers with the U.S. Federal Election Commission in November 2013 to run for President in the 2016 election as a Democrat. 2016 vice-presidential candidacy After failing to gain traction for his presidential bid, he was then nominated by the American Delta Party, and by the Reform Party of the United States as the vice-presidential running mate of 2016 presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente.Winger, Richard (August 9, 2016) \\"Reform Party Nominates Rocky De La Fuente for President\\", Ballot Access News.

By 1872 he had acquired freehold to several allotments totalling over 2,000 acres and the north-west corner of Ballangeich following the 1969 Selection Act. A large gum tree which stands on the banks of the Hopkins River was originally used by the women folk as a wash-house, stones being placed down to the water’s edge for their convenience in performing their domestic duties.The Victorian Centenary Book page 293 He decided to swap portion of his property and an old homestead with George Threlfall who had property in Ballarat.The Victorian Centenary Book page 292 He was a member of Mortlake Shire Council for many years and was replaced by Mr Threlfall.Camperdown Chronicle 8 February 1888 The old station has a private cemetery in which many of the old pioneers have been laid to rest. At the time that Ballangeich was thrown open for selection, someone selected this piece of land known as \\"The Groves\\" on the bank of the Hopkins River. On hearing of this Captain Eddington started off on horseback – at night – to lodge a petition that it be declared a cemetery. The letter signed by the superintendent Charles La Trobe, made the necessary grant dated 1848. Ballangeich was named by Captain Eddington after the Pass of Ballangeich below Stirling Castle where he had played in his boyhood. In earlier times the aborigines were very numerous in the neighbourhood, but there was seldom any trouble with them except for the occasional killing of cattle for food.

He was also the count of the Viennois from 1023, the first bishop of Vienne to hold secular power in the county simultaneously. Burchard belonged to the Anselmid lineage. He was the eldest son of Anselm (died after 1002), a nobleman described in documents as an \\"illustrious man\\" (vir inluster), and his wife, Aldiud, who had been the concubine, about 964, of King Conrad of Burgundy. Anselm and Aldiud were married around 970. Burchard's younger brothers were Anselm, bishop of Aosta, and Ulric, who was married to a woman named Girelda. In addition, the woman named Ancilla who married Count Humbert I of Savoy was probably Burchard's sister. In early 1019, Burchard removed Humbert as advocatus of the archdiocese of Vienne and gave the position to his brother Ulric. On 19 August 1019, Burchard and his brother Ulric donated land in the Genevois to the church of Saint Peter in Vienne for the sake of their parents' souls. Through his mother, Burchard was the half- brother of Archbishop Burchard II of Lyon, Conrad's illegitimate son. He probably owed his election to the see of Vienne to royal preferment. On 14 September 1023, King Rudolf III and Queen Ermengard granted the county of the Viennois to the archbishop of Vienne. With this acquisition, Burchard controlled the fiscal lands of the county as well as its castle. Rudolf had previously bestowed the county, along with that of Sermorens, on Ermengard in 1011, shortly after their marriage. The county of Sermorens was not ceded to the archbishop. The French historian Georges de Manteyer advanced the theory that Burchard created the counties of Maurienne and Albon out of the Viennois and enfeoffed them to the families that would be the Savoyards and Dauphins in 1023. Burchard was regarded as a proponent of the Peace of God movement and his epitaph reads: :Agnos defensans et fortiter hostibus instans, :Prosternens nocuos belligerans cuneos. :Victricem palmam Domini perduxit in aulam, :Cum quo perpetua pace viget placida. Defending lambs and bravely pressing enemies, Battling and making the dangerous troops bow. He led them in the palace to the victorious prize of God, With which perpetual peace quietly thrives.

He was killed by firing squad at Fort Mont- Valérien in 1942. Early years Jacques Solomon was born on 4 February 1908 in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. Solomon's father, Iser Solomon, was a medical radiologist and member of various learned societies in Europe and America. Solomon became an intern at the Hôpitaux de Paris, then began studying physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne. At the time, the course covered subjects such as optics, electricity and classical mechanics, but not more recent subjects such as statistical mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetism or the controversial subjects of relativity and quantum mechanics. Solomon was researching theoretical physics at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1929 when he married Hélène Langevin (1909–95), daughter of Paul Langevin (1872–1946), a professor at the Collège de France. In 1931, Solomon submitted a thesis on electrodynamics and quantum theory, which earned him recognition as one of the greatest physicists of his time. At the age of 29, he began teaching at the Collège de France. Both Solomon and Matvei Petrovich Bronstein believed in the need for a radically different method of treating quantum gravity, since the present theory of field quantization seemed incompatible with the non-linear theory of gravitation. Both were to die during the war. In 1934, Solomon joined the French Communist Party (PCE). He taught at the Open University, and contributed to the Cahiers du Bolchevisme and to L'Humanité. In 1935, he worked for the election of Paul Rivet, the first member of the Popular Front to be elected. After the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, he was one of the secretaries of the Union des intellectuels français pour la justice, la liberté et la paix (UDIF). World War II With the outbreak of World War II (1939-45), Solomon was mobilized in the medical service, first in Courseulles, Calvados, and then in Agen. He was demobilized in Agen at the end of June 1940 and after a month returned to Paris. Georges Politzer was in touch with the clandestine PCE through Pierre Villon, and in September and October 1940 Solomon, Politzer and Jacques Decour tried to contact and organize the universities. After Paul Langevin was arrested by the Germans on 30 October 1940 Solomon, Politzer and Fernand Holweck organized protests by students and professors in front of the College de France on 5 and 8 November 1940. He adopted the pseudonym \\"Jacques Pinel\\", and with his wife was one of the main contributors to the Université libre, which began to appear in November 1940 and exposed the \\"obscurantism\\" and antisemitism of the Vichy regime. He also contributed to La Pensée libre. Georges Politzer was arrested on 14 February 1942. Solomon was arrested by the special brigades on 2 March 1942 in a Paris cafe where he was having a working meeting for L'Université with Dr. Jean-Claude Bauer, who was also arrested. He was interned at the police station until 20 March, then at the Cherche-Midi prison until 11 May, and finally at La Santé Prison. He was handed over to the Germans and shot as a hostage on 23 May 1942 at Fort Mont-Valérien on the same day as Politzer and Bauer. 84 hostages were executed that month. The last four, executed on 30 May 1942 in reprisal for an attempted assassination in Le Havre on 23 May 1942, were Arthur Dallidet, Félix Cadras, Jacques Decour and Louis Salomon. In 1951, Jacques Solomon was given the posthumous title of Commandant of the Front Nationale. His wife, Hélène, had been arrested on 10 March 1942. She was taken to the Auschwitz concentration camp, then to Ravensbrück concentration camp. She managed to survive the war, and lived on until 1995.

After processing, the product is sold to a seafood distributor that ships them to Japan, China, and Thailand. Edible jellyfish prepared with sesame oil and chili sauce Rhopilema esculentum is a species of edible jellyfish Some species of jellyfish are suitable for human consumption and are used as a source of food and as an ingredient in various dishes. Edible jellyfish is a seafood that is harvested and consumed in several East and Southeast Asian countries, and in some Asian countries it is considered to be a delicacy. Edible jellyfish is often processed into a dried product. Several types of foods and dishes may be prepared with edible jellyfish, including salads, sushi, noodles, and main courses. Various preparation methods exist. Edible jellyfish In China, some species of jellyfish in the Rhizostomae order caught in coastal areas have been utilized as an aphrodisiac and a source of food and ingredient in Chinese cuisine for over 1,700 years. Cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus meleagris) and jelly blubber (Catostylus mosaicus) are edible species of jellyfish. When live, the cannonball jellyfish contains toxins that can cause cardiac problems in animals (including humans). Rhopilema esculentum and Rhopilema hispidium are edible jellyfish, and are the most common ones consumed in China, Japan and Korea. Additional edible jellyfish species include Aurelia aurita, Crambionella orsini, Chrysaora pacifica, Lobonema smithi, Lobonemoides gracilis and Nomura's jellyfish (Stomolophus nomuria). Desalted ready-to-use jellyfish are low in calories and contain hardly any fat, about 5% protein and 95% water. They do not have much flavor, and may be used to add additional texture and mouthfeel to various dishes. In some areas of Asia, jellyfish is \\"associated with easing bone and muscle pain.\\" Production In 2001, the annual global harvest of edible jellyfish was estimated to be around 321,000 metric tons. The most prominent countries involved in edible jellyfish production are Burma, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, jellyfish larvae are reared in ponds before being released as juveniles into the sea to grow and mature. In Southeast Asia, edible species of jellyfish may be harvested using various nets such as drift nets, scoop nets, set nets and hand nets, hooks and beach seines. In 2001, the estimated annual catch in Southeast Asia in net weight was at around 169,000 metric tons. The amount of jellyfish caught annually in this region can vary significantly, and the fishing season for them is relatively short, at two to four months. Processing Traditional methods of processing jellyfish into a dried food product can take a considerable amount of time, between 19 and 37 days. A common processing technique is the preservation of jellyfish, which may utilize salt curing to accomplish this, creating a dried finished product. Some commercially processed edible jellyfish are purveyed in dried sheets. The process of producing dehydrated jellyfish typically includes the removal of the tentacles prior to drying, because the upper dome area of the marine animal is the part typically used for cooking. Jellyfish deteriorate rapidly at room temperature so processing starts soon after they are caught. The bell is separated from the dangling oral arms and both are washed in seawater before being scraped to remove the gonads and mucus. Dehydration is traditionally undertaken by sprinkling the jellyfish with table salt and alum, draining off the brine and repeating the process. Finally the jellyfish are heaped to drain, turned several times and left to dry. The whole process takes three to six weeks and results in a product with about 65% moisture and 20% salt. The alum reduces the pH and serves to firm the texture while the salt removes water and prevents microbial deterioration. In Malaysia and Thailand, a little sodium bicarbonate, which facilitates dehydration and increases crispness, is added during processing. Consumption Jellyfish is consumed in several Asian and Southeast Asian countries. In 2001, it was reported that Japan had annually imported between 5,400 and 10,000 tons of edible jellyfish from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Dehydrated and pickled jellyfish is considered a delicacy in several Asian countries, including China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Japan. re-hydrating Dehydrated jellyfish can be prepared for eating by soaking it in water for several hours to rehydrate it, and then parboiling, rinsing and slicing it. Hazard Consuming echizen kurage is potentially dangerous if the toxic part is not thoroughly cleaned and cooked. Dishes Jellyfish salad, a popular dish in some areas of Asia, may be prepared using cold marinated jellyfish that is thinly sliced. Some Asian airlines serve jellyfish salad as a part of their meals. Jellyfish sushi is consumed in Japan. In Thailand, a crunchy style of noodle is produced using jellyfish. The Japanese company Tango Jersey Dairy produces a vanilla and jellyfish ice cream, prepared using cubes of diced Nomura's jellyfish (Echizen kurage in Japanese) soaked in milk. It has been described as \\"slightly chewy.\\" Following the 2009 Japanese Nomura's jellyfish bloom, students in Obama, Fukui designed a Nomura Jellyfish powder to be used to make caramel sweets as part of a NASA-designed food safety management system established in the school.

Blatt and written by Marvin Borowsky and Thomas Job. The film stars Jean Sullivan, Philip Dorn, Irene Manning, Helmut Dantine, Alan Hale, Sr. and Samuel S. Hinds. The film was released by Warner Bros. on May 1, 1945. Plot The action takes place in the southwestern United States late in World War II. Four POWs from Nazi Germany escape American custody and eventually wind up taking over a small gas station/hotel in the desert. They plan to obtain a fueled-up vehicle and flee the country. A Dutch military pilot traveling through America on his way to fight in the Pacific is mistaken by some locals as one of the Nazis. Eventually, however, he helps lead the resistance against the Germans. The setting, some of the characters and a few plot elements are reminiscent of the 1936 film The Petrified Forest. But while Escape in the Desert has occasionally been called a \\"remake\\" of the earlier film, the two are in essence very different. The two main male characters are nothing like those in The Petrified Forest, and their conflict is also dissimilar. Critics at the time noticed the superficial resemblance to the earlier film, but described Escape in the desert as basically an action picture, a sort of updated Western with Nazis as the villains.

The Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema, compiled by Gulzar and Saibal Chatterjee, describes him as one of the \\"few names that stand out for their contribution to Hindi film lyrics\\".  Film career  Asad Bhopali was born in Bhopal, as Asadullah Khan. He was the eldest child of Munshi Ahmed Khan, a teacher of Arabian and Persian languages. In 1949, Asad Bhopali was spotted by the Fazli Brothers, a film producer duo of Bombay (now Mumbai). Following the partition of India, Aarzoo Lakhnavi, the lyricist of their film Duniya, migrated to newly created Pakistan. By this time, only two of the film's songs had been written. Fazli Brothers were looking for new lyricists. Businessman Sugam Kapadia, who owned a few cinema theatres in Bhopal, told them that there were many good poets in Bhopal, and suggested that they attend a mushaira (meet of poets) there. The Fazli Brothers agreed, and Kapadia organized a mushaira at his Bhopal Talkies on 5 May 1949. Impressed by Asad Bhopali's performance, the producers invited him to Bombay. At the age of 28, Asad Bhopali traveled to Bombay on 18 May 1949, to become a lyricist in the Hindi film industry. Asad Bhopali wrote two songs for Fazli Brothers' Duniya (1949): Rona hai to chupke chupke (sung by Mohammad Rafi) and Armaan lute, dil toot gaya (sung by Suraiyya). The next year, he wrote songs for a couple of films; these songs were sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Shamshad Begum. Bhopali's big break was BR Chopra's Afsana (1951), for which he wrote 5 songs. Bhopali went on to work with several noted music directors. He wrote the popular song Woh Jab Yaad Aaye, Bahut Yaad Aaye for Laxmikant–Pyarelal's first released film Parasmani. He wrote a large number of film songs composed by Usha Khanna. From 1949 to 1990, he wrote about 400 songs for over a hundred films. However, he was not as successful as the top lyricists such as Majrooh Sultanpuri, Sahir Ludhianvi, Jan Nisar Akhtar and Rajendra Krishan. Many of the films he wrote for were low-grade films, and he used to get only a few songs in high-end movies, unlike other established lyricists.Aaj ke Fankaar programme on Asad Bhopali. Vividh Bharati, 8 June 2003. Bhopali was one of the lyricists who wrote songs for the 1989 musical hit Maine Pyar Kiya. Shortly after, he suffered from a severe paralytic stroke. His family took him to Bhopal. In 1990, he received the Filmfare Award for Dil Deewana, but could not attend the award ceremony. Asad Bhopali died on 9 June 1990, in Bhopal. He wrote songs for Rang Bhoomi, which was released after his death, in 1992. Roshni, Dhoop, Chandni, a collection of his poetry, was published by the Urdu Akademi of Bhopal in 1995.Bibliographic Detail, National Library, Ministry of Culture, Government of India. Asad Bhopali married twice. He had two sons (Taj and Taabish) and six daughters from his first marriage, with Ayesha.

The film is set in France in the early 19th century after the Napoleonic wars where a traveling circus visits the castle of the Count Drago (Christopher Lee). Drago's habit of experimenting on animals is revealed and the visitors are about to become unwilling participants before they are rescued by a dwarf. Since its release, a number of contradictory production histories concerning Castle of the Living Dead have surfaced, with the film's direction being variously attributed to Kiefer (who was credited with the alias \\"Lorenzo Sabatini\\" on Italian prints), Riccardo Freda, or Luciano Ricci (credited as \\"Herbert Wise\\"). Other mysteries include the extent of assistant director Michael Reeves' involvement in the production, and whether or not Mario Bava provided special effects for the film. Production American Warren Kiefer moved to Italy to pursue a career in the film industry. There he met American- born producer Paul Maslansky at Cinecittà. The two got along and decided to make a film together. Kiefer provided the script for Castle of the Living Dead. The two put in $10,000 and contacted Christopher Lee for ten days of shooting. Many sources cite Lorenzo Sabatini as the director of Castle of the Living Dead, but the name was created by Kiefer for tax reasons while creating the film. To complicate it further, the film was a French-Italian co- production, which meant that an Italian director was required to collect certain state subsidies. In the Italian version of the film, Kiefer is credited as only for the story and script while the name Herbert Wise was used as the director. Wise was a pseudonym for Luciano Ricci, Kiefer's assistant director. All other prints credit Kiefer as the sole director. Many promotional materials and reviews of the film since the release have credited various directors as the director including Ricci, the fictional Wise, and Riccardo Freda. Among the crew of Castle of the Living Dead was Michael Reeves. Paul Maslansky met Reeves previously on the set of The Long Ships (1964) and invited him to work on Castle of the Living Dead. Reeves is credited as an assistant director on the film, but rumours have spread since his premature death that he had done more on the film including that he had shot al the sequences at the Parco dei Mostri while others have said he took over the production nine days into shooting the film. Maslansky spoke in 1999 that the rumours of him directing the film were untrue and that he remained on second unit for the entire film. Kiefer's second unit director Frederick Muller that the film was entirely directed by Kiefer without Reeves presence. Kiefer also stated that Reeves had not had anything to do with the directing in the film. The film was shot in five weeks at Castello Orsini-Odescalchi and Bomarzo in Italy. Kiefer estimated the budget as $135,000 while Paul Maslansky stated it was $125,000. To speed up the production, Kiefer and Maslansky set each room they were shooting in the castle in order so after one scene was filmed, the next room in the castle would be ready for the following scene. In Tim Lucas' book Mario Bava, All the Colours of the Dark, an interview with Luciano Pigozzi states that Mario Bava created a special effect for the film involving a large sailing ship. There is no scene in the film involving boats and Lucas has assumed that this effect would show up when the film was shown at its proper aspect ratio or that the scene had been cut. Muller had later noted that he did not recall seeing Mario Bava on the set ever.

After some initial success in taking over several key cities in the northern half of the country, the Escobar rebels were decisively defeated in a major battle at Jiménez, Chihuahua, and were eventually swept aside by the advancing government forces under the command of General Calles. Background The Escobar Rebellion was the last in a series of rebellions following the end of the Mexican civil war in 1920, when the left wing faction of Plutarco Elías Calles, Álvaro Obregón and Adolfo de la Huerta (collectively known as \\"The Sonoran Triangle\\") took control of the federal government from Venustiano Carranza under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Following the assassination of President-elect Obregón on July 17, 1928, and the end of Calles' term as president on November 30, the former governor of Tamaulipas, Emilio Portes Gil, was selected unanimously to succeed Calles as provisional president until a new election could be held the following year, in November 1929. As a civilian with no military experience, the selection of Portes Gil upset many officers in the Mexican military, now largely composed of the armies of individual revolutionary leaders, who wanted one of their own in office to continue the tradition of having a general for president. Earlier, Venustiano Carranza had attempted to impose a civilian to succeed him in the 1920 elections, leading to his ouster and death. At the time, one of the Mexican Army's most popular and wealthy officers was General Don José Gonzalo Escobar, who was described as \\"brave, young and dashing\\" for his role in defeating Pancho Villa in the 1919 battle for Ciudad Juárez and for later involvement in crushing the de la Huerta revolt of 1923 and the Gomez-Serrano revolt in 1927. Although Escobar at first proclaimed his loyalty to Calles and his successor, neither president trusted him and both considered Escobar to be high on their list of troublesome generals. As Escobar was assuring Calles and Portes Gil of his loyalty, in secret he made plans to take control of the federal government and establish himself as president. Drafting the \\"Plan of Hermosillo\\" late in 1928, Escobar planned to launch his rebellion the following spring, citing corruption in the Calles-Portes Gil government as the reason for the revolt, which was called the \\"Renovating Revolution\\" by Escobar and his men. Portes Gil, like Escobar, knew that the success of any rebellion would largely be determined by supplies brought in from across the international border in the United States. Consequently, Portes Gil launched a \\"two-phase plan\\" to have the United States government seal the border to any potential rebel needs and also resupply the Mexican Army with war materiel, including modern combat aircraft. Both requests were granted in February 1929, just weeks before the opening of hostilities. Rebellion General José Gonzalo Escobar, as he appeared in a 1929 newspaper The rebellion officially began on March 3, 1929. Escobar maintained his guise as a loyal subject for as long as he could, having sent a letter to Portes Gil offering his services just hours before leading an attack on the city of Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon. Many Mexican Army officers defected to join Escobar's rebellion, often taking their entire command with them, so that by the opening of hostilities Escobar was in command of nearly 30,000 men, including a large contingent of Yaqui Indians. After a ten-hour battle Monterrey was under rebel control. Escobar remained in the city just as long as it took to remove $345,000 from local banks and to ransack the home of General Juan Andreu Almazán. From there Escobar retired by way of Saltillo, tearing up railroad tracks as he went. Portes Gil moved quickly to crush Escobar's rebellion by putting Calles in command of federal military and naval forces, which consisted of about 72% of Mexico's original ground forces, in addition to the air force and some 5,000 agrarians from San Luis Potosí. The beginning of the rebellion was set to coincide with the inauguration of President Herbert Hoover on March 4, 1929. Escobar hoped that if he could win a few battles and quickly take control of the government that he would receive recognition from Hoover's administration by default, as his foreign policies were not yet defined, but Hoover backed Portes Gil and the established constitution. This had a significant impact on the outcome of the rebellion, according to columnist Drew Pearson, who said that many of the garrisons that defected to join Escorbar's revolt soon deserted back to the federal government after learning of Hoover's decision. Immediately after their capture of Monterrey, Escobar forces further up north moved to take control of the ports of entry along the Arizona-Sonora border, while further to the south Escobar forces under General Jesus M. Aguirre unsuccessfully attacked Veracruz. Rebels in Sinaloa won a significant victory at Mazatlán, where they inflicted \\"considerable punishment\\" on retreating government forces and in Agua Prieta and Naco, the garrisons revolted to join the rebels, placing the customs collector and other officials in jail. At the same time a force of some 500 rebels occupied Nogales, Sonora, and succeeded in placing the customs collector, the immigration inspector, the postmaster and other officials under arrest. However, most of those arrested swore allegiance to Escobar and were allowed to return to work shortly thereafter. After successfully taking over the Arizona ports of entry, several border towns on the West Texas frontier quickly came under rebel control. By March 5, rebel forces were in command of Villa Acuña, Piedras Negras and Ojinaga, and moving to take control of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico's largest city on the international border and its greatest port of entry, opposite of El Paso, Texas. The Battle of Juárez The Battle of Juárez began a couple of days later in the early morning hours of March 8. Rebel forces under the command of General Marcelino Murrieta quickly swept through the city, forcing the federal garrison back to positions along the Rio Grande, adjacent to the international border and thousands of American spectators who had formed up to watch the hostilities from the river's edge, windows and roof tops. Troopers of the 7th Cavalry were also present to protect American lives and prevent the fighting from spilling over to their side of the border. Several stray bullets landed on the American side, causing a few casualties, but nobody was killed. The thirteen-story El Paso bank building was struck so many times that the upper floors had to be evacuated for safety. After hours of heavy fighting along the international border, when it appeared as though the rebels would soon be victorious, the commander of the American forces in El Paso, General George Van Horn Moseley, crossed the line into Mexico to confer with the federal commander, General Matias Ramos, to ask about his intentions. General Ramos informed Moseley that he was willing to surrender the city, but only if the rebels guaranteed him and his men proper treatment as prisoners of war, or be allowed to cross into the United States for internment. The latter was agreed upon and by the end of the day some 300 Mexican Army officers and men, along with their wives and children, crossed the border for internment at Fort Bliss. The rebels were now in control of Mexico's most important port of entry, and they intended to use it as a source of weapons and war material and other supplies from the United States. Air war During the Escobar Rebellion, both the federal government and the Escobar rebels used aircraft in ways never before seen on the American continent. The air war began on the morning of March 16, 1929, when two federal airplanes dropped bombs on rebel troop trains at the railyard in Torreon and then on the military base just outside town. After the attack, General Escobar realized that he was at a major disadvantage without an air force of his own, so he immediately took steps to acquire aircraft from the United States and American mercenaries to pilot them. The federal government also looked to the United States for supplying aircraft and even hired an American combat veteran named Major Rayma L. Andrews to take command of their new squadron. Major Andrews was a veteran of World War I, where he served with the British Royal Flying Corps. After the war he continued his travels across Latin America, selling airplanes and demonstrating bombing techniques. When the Escobar Rebellion broke out, Andrews offered his services to the Mexican government, which signed a contract with him and tasked him with acquiring new aircraft from the United States, which would be paid for by the Mexican government via depositing money into an account at the El Paso National Bank. Andrews purchased a wide variety of civilian model biplanes, including Travel Airs, Eaglerocks, and Steamermans, and later in the conflict he flew some of the Vought \\"Corsair\\" warplanes purchased by the Mexican government in February 1929. On the rebel side, General Escobar hired a number of American pilots for $1,000 a week, including Art J. Smith, Pete Stanley, Jack O'Brien, Patrick Murphy and Richard H. Polk, one of two professional revolution followers who made a career of \\"revolution hopping\\" across Latin America. Later on these five men were joined by Phil Mohun, another experienced combat veteran that deserted the federal air force to join the revolution and who would eventually emerge as a key member of the rebel air force, which was aptly named the \\"Yankee Doodle Escadrille\\". Overall command of the Yankee Doodle Escadrille was given to General Gustavo Salinas, a cultured man who was educated and learned to fly in the United States and who was a veteran of some of the other the Mexican revolutions of the 1920s. The rebel air force consisted of just ten aircraft, all civilian types converted for military use, except for one captured \\"Corsair\\". Most were purchased in Arizona and illegally flown into Mexico from airports in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. Relying on small arms like the Thompson sub-machine gun and improvised bombs for armaments, the Yankee Doodle Escadrille was ill-suited for all combat roles, but would unhesitatingly attack federal aircraft or bomb enemy troop concentrations, scoring a few victories. One of the first major engagements involving the Yankee Doodle Escadrille was the Battle of Jiménez, which began on March 30 and ended five days later when federal forces took control of the area. During the fighting, seven rebel aircraft faced an unknown number of federal \\"Corsair\\" biplanes, resulting in the loss of two rebel aircraft and the capture of a \\"Corsair\\" from the federals. The capture of the \\"Corsair\\" occurred when Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Fierro approached the rebel lines at Jimenez to drop a few bombs and some propaganda leaflets, which urged the rebels to give up. As Fierro approached the city, Phil Mohun and Richard Polk took off in their vintage biplanes to challenge the enemy. Just as Mohun moved in to open fire, rebel ground forces opened up as well. One bullet struck the plane's carburetor, forcing Fierro to make a sudden emergency landing in enemy territory. Taking the machine gun, Fierro and his observer, a Lieutenant Valle, set off into the surrounding hills, just ahead of a unit of rebel cavalry sent after them. Mohun took credit for the victory and he repaired the captured \\"Corsair\\" for his own use. In another engagement, Polk was hit in the face by a bullet and severely damaged his aircraft while attempting to make an emergency landing. Later on, Mohun's plane was \\"riddled\\" by machine-gun fire from a \\"Corsair\\", forcing him to make a hazardous crash landing, as he was flying without a parachute. The battle eventually turned for the federals when Lt. Col. Fierro dropped bombs on a rebel train car filled with dynamite. The resulting explosion was massive and sent the rebels into a disorderly retreat. Hundreds were subsequently cut down by federal cavalrymen as they tried to escape the slaughter. The Yankee Doodle Escadrille served in all theaters of the conflict, although newspapers indicate that it scored its greatest success in Sonora, during the battles for the ports of entry. During the siege of Naco, beginning on March 31, a rebel plane allegedly flown by the Irish pilot Patrick Murphy scored two direct hits on federal trenches, killing at least two soldiers, according to a newspaper. Murphy also managed to drop several bombs on the American side of the border, causing a significant amount of damage and a few injuries, as well as making history by committing the first ever aerial bombardment of United States territory. Murphy was eventually shot down by federal ground fire, but he somehow escaped into Arizona. In all, over 100 bombs were dropped by rebel pilots during the battle for Naco, although casualties from these attacks were relatively light. In another engagement on April 4, a federal airplane out bombing rebel positions was shot down by enemy ground fire a few miles south of Naco. Both the aviator and the bomb dropper were killed, and their charred bodies were brought into town under a flag of truce. Out of respect for the dead, General Fausto Topete announced that his pilots would not bomb Naco that evening. Sometime after that, Major Andrews attacked a rebel troop concentration outside of Naco with two 100-pound bombs. When the rebels saw the enemy plane, they ran to take cover underneath the overhanging banks of a dry river, creating the perfect target of men and animals for Andrews. Dropping both of his bombs, Andrews circled around and through the columns of dust he counted eight dead officers along with several enlisted men and their horses. Surrender at Nogales Following Escobar's defeat in the Battle of Jiménez, the revolutionary fervor which had taken hold of the country was diminishing and his troops were now deserting in large numbers. Leading his remaining units north into Sonora, he intended to hold out for as long as he could. Government forces under Calles rapidly took control of the cities left in Escobar's wake until finally arriving at Nogales, the rebels' last major stronghold. On the morning of April 30, three federal airplanes dropped twelve bombs over the city. There were no casualties reported, but the sound of the explosions and the return fire from rebel ground forces was enough to cause thousands of Mexicans to flee to the American side of the border for protection. The exodus continued until 3:00 PM, by which time as many as 10,000 Mexican refugees had crossed into Arizona. Fear of additional airstrikes and the realization that the war was lost prompted many of the rebel officers to consider surrendering to the federals or fleeing into the United States, to avoid punishment by the Mexican government. At noon that day, the commander of American forces at Fort Huachuca, General Frank S. Cocheu, met with a group of rebel officers at the border in Nogales to negotiate the terms of surrender. The rebels agreed to surrender Nogales, Sonora, but only if the Mexican government promised not to execute or otherwise molest any of the rebel soldiers, and give them food and back pay. All of the conditions were agreed upon, and by the end of the day Nogales was under the control of the government forces of General Lucas González. With the rebellion at an end, General Escobar boarded a plane and flew it into Arizona, where he asked for and received asylum from the American authorities. When asked about his defeat, Escobar blamed the lack of supplies, munitions and support from the United States government. On March 3, 1930, a grand jury in Tucson, Arizona, filed a seven-count suit against Escobar, several of his generals, and members of the Yankee Doodle Escadrille, for \\"unlawfully exporting arms and munitions of war from the United States to Mexico\\", but the case was later dismissed on May 25, 1932. Escobar remained in exile in Canada for the next several years until 1942, shortly after the American entrance into World War II, when he returned to Mexico to offer his services to President Lázaro Cárdenas. By 1952 he had achieved the rank of major general in the Mexican Army and was active in politics. He died in Mexico City in 1969.

Born into an intellectual family in Chimitelnic, Mureș County, Transylvania, he began his education at the Greek-Catholic gymnasium in Târgu Mureș. He then went to the Piarist high school in Cluj, followed by the University of Vienna. He received a doctorate in philosophy in 1814, becoming the first Romanian to do so, according to Gheorghe Asachi. In 1817, he received a second doctorate, in medicine. Later that year, he moved to Brașov, where he wrote a treatise on the mineral water of Arpătac, Bodoc and Covasna, considered the first Romanian-language medical work. In 1820, Asachi invited several Transylvanian intellectuals, including Pop, to teach in Iași, the capital of Moldavia. There, Pop became director of the Romanian Orthodox Socola seminary, where he also taught philosophy and philology. He was obliged to leave after several months, due to the outbreak of an uprising in neighboring Wallachia. In 1828, he began working as a doctor in the Făgăraș area, where he was tasked with combating a plague. The following year, he moved to the mining center of Zlatna, where he became chief medical officer and spent the remaining thirteen years of his life. He visited the various mining towns in order to familiarize himself with the workers' conditions and drafted recommendations for better organizing medical and social services. He dealt with work-related diseases and accidents, vaccination of children, endemic diseases and the betterment of conditions for doctors. He became close friends with George Bariț; 39 of their letters, which touch on political and cultural matters, survive. The two collaborated on a series of articles, with Pop showing particular interest in orthography. In early 1842, as Pop lay dying, the surrounding villages would send messengers to find out his state. When he died, the crowd standing in the square in front of his home burst into tears.

Life Early years Albert Métin was born on 23 January 1871 in Besançon, Doubs. He was a brilliant scholar, and gained degrees in History and Geography. He became a professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers. Métin was one of the first to receive a travel grant from the University of Paris. He spent 18 months travelling around the world, and visited Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand in 1899 he found that the radical social legislation in New Zealand had been implemented in a series of pragmatic steps that addressed specific issues, and had little grounding in political theory. He could not understand how New Zealand could have the world's \\"most advanced labor legislation\\" with \\"the weakest labor party.\\" He coined the phrase \\"Socialism with no doctrine\\" (Le socialisme sans doctrines) to describe the Australasian reforms. On his return Métin wrote Le socialisme sans doctrines: la question agraire et la question ouvrière en Australie et Nouvelle-Zélande in which he described \\"these countries in which the state has set limits to the right of property, has instituted the eight-hour day, the minimum wage, compulsory arbitration, with many other measures which have given the English antipodean colonies the surname Paradise of Workingmen.\\" He strongly disapproved of the support given by labor to queen, empire and church. He wrote that labor was, \\"not in the least interested in building a socialist society, but in aping the bourgeoisie and in winning for themselves all the concessions and advantages possible within a capitalist society.\\" In October 1904 Métin was head of a French delegation that visited the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, US. The delegation visited Quebec, mainly Quebec City and Montreal, from 12–15 October. The party included several leading radicals, including Alphonse Verville, Joseph-Alphonse Rodier, Joseph Ainey, Isisdore Tremblay and Narcisse Arcand. Pre-war politics On the basis of his work on foreign labor laws Métin was selected by René Viviani as chief of staff in the Ministry of Labor when it was created by Georges Clemenceau in 1906. Métin was elected Deputy for the second district of Besançon on 12 December 1909, and was reelected on 24 April 1910 and on 26 April 1914 as a Democratic Republican. He sat with the radical socialists. He also became General Councillor of Doubs. In the period before World War I (1914–18) he was a member of commissions on social security, civil pensions, fiscal legislation, the budget and foreign affairs. On 9 December 1913 Gaston Doumergue appointed him Minister of Labor and Social Security, a position he held until 3 June 1914. He was supported by the journal le Petit Comtois, which in January 1914 reported his work to give workers access to low-cost housing, to improve old age pensions, particularly for women and widows, to obtain disability pensions and to provide insurance against agricultural accidents. The journal published his historical history of Ornans and Amancey. World War I After the declaration of war Métin was mobilized and served as an infantry lieutenant on the eastern front. Métin returned to the chamber, and was general rapporteur for the budget committee. He was again appointed Minister of Labor and Social Security from 29 October 1915 to 12 December 1916 in the cabinet of Aristide Briand. He was Sub- Secretary of State for Finance from 14 December 1916 to 17 August 1917. On 27 July 1917 Denys Cochin submitted his resignation as sub-secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, largely due to frustration over difficulties in achieving a full blockade of Germany and her allies. The cabinet accepted Cochin's resignation on 10 August 1917. Metin took his place, holding office until Clemenceau created a blockade ministry under Charles-Célestin Jonnart on 17 November 1917. Métin was then appointed head of the French mission to Australia. His friend André Siegfried was secretary general of the mission from July 1918. Métin died on 16 August 1918 in San Francisco of apoplexy, thought to have been caused by the strain of his work on the mission. He was a knight of the Legion of Honor.

He attended the schools in that town, later moving to Boston to continue his education there. He worked as a draftsman for Peabody & Stearns, Allen & Collens, and others. In 1918 he returned to Leominster to open his own office, moving it to Fitchburg in 1920. In 1921 he and Harold E. Mason, an architect formerly of Keene, New Hampshire, formed a partnership, Haynes & Mason.Architectural Forum July 1921: 44. By 1932 Mason was working semi-independently from an office in Leominster, and in 1933 they split completely. Haynes then established the firm of S. W. Haynes & Associates, which remained active until 1962.Fitchburg (MA) Sentinel 27 Oct. 1962: 6. Upon the new year, the firm was reestablished as Haynes, Lieneck & Smith. Haynes died in 1983, but the office, relocated to Ashby in the 1980s, remains active. He designed buildings in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut, several of which have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture For the first decade and a half of his career, Haynes primarily designed his buildings in the Colonial Revival style. He designed a number of major buildings in this style, including the Community Memorial Hospital and the Randall Hotel. After 1935, he switched to the Art Deco style, though only briefly. In this style, he designed the Anthony Building on the Fitchburg State campus, the high school at Uxbridge, and the Latchis Hotel in Brattleboro, Vermont. After the beginning of the war he gradually transitioned to the International Style, thus embracing modernism. His Burbank Hospital School of Nursing dates from this period, as is the Peter Noyes School in Sudbury. For the rest of his career, his and his firm's works were in the Modernist manner. Large educational complexes of this era include the high schools at Saugus, East Longmeadow, Lincoln-Sudbury Regional, and North Andover. Some of Haynes' schools departed from their stripped-down aesthetic to include some more expressive detail, as at Mendon's former Nipmuc Regional High School, and at the fire station in Shirley. These details were probably due to the influence of Paul Lieneck. In 1966 the office had the chance to design one last major Colonial Revival-influenced work. Calvin Coolidge College, a small Boston school associated with the New England School of Law, had decided on a move out of the city to rural Ashburnham.\\"Hub's Calvin Coolidge College Will Be Relocated To Area\\".

Sports ownership Hammes has an ownership interest in the Milwaukee Bucks. Hammes is an owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks. Heartland In September 2000, Heartland arranged a two-year bond-sale transaction with the state pension agency. Two weeks later Heartland took huge write-downs on distressed or defaulted bonds in its funds. Heartland's transaction with the Wisconsin Investment Board attracted criticism as a sweetheart deal to help a local firm that was sorely in need of cash to meet redemption requests from Heartland fund shareholders. The investment board paid $8.3 million for the troubled bonds, whose value decreased to $2.3 million as of June 2001. In 2000, Heartland Advisors marked down the value of their funds, the Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond Fund and the Short Duration High-Yield Municipal Fund. The SEC estimated that shareholders lost about $80 million. Hammes was an independent director of the Heartland funds. The SEC issued a consent order requiring four of Heartland's independent directors, including John Hammes, to cease and desist violating securities laws through \\"their negligent failure to adequately monitor the liquidity of the funds and to take adequate steps to address funds' pricing deficiencies.\\" They agreed to the order without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Wisconsin investment board In 1996, Hammes was appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson to be chairman of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, a state agency responsible for investing the assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and six other trust funds established by the state. Heartland Advisors sold a portfolio of distressed bonds for $8.3 million to the pension fund of the State of Wisconsin in late September 2000. Heartland officials were referred to the state board's staff by Hammes, and although he recused himself from the state board's consideration of the Heartland investment, the actions relationship was described as, \\"at best, unseemly, and at worst, dangerous to the pension funds of thousands of state employees,\\" by a co-chairman of the state legislature's Joint Audit Committee. Tomahawk Timberlands Jon Hammes was the managing partner of the Brookfield-based Tomahawk Timberlands and Tomahawk Highlands logging and development companies, which purchased over 78,000 acres of Wisconsin timberland from the Packaging Corp. of America in 1999. In 2002, the federal government and the state of Wisconsin paid Tomahawk $7.25 million for conservation easements to permanently restrict development on 35,337 acres in Iron Oneida, Marathon, and Lincoln Counties. Most of this land was sold in 2007 to the Potlatch REIT for $64.5 million, which later sold to various TIMOs, public agencies, NGO's, and smaller private buyers. In 2015, the Hammes Family still owned over a thousand acres of forestland through the Badger II Limited Partnership and HC 100 LLC.

It is one of the oldest districts of Doha. Doha's rapid urbanization during the 1970s after it gained independence resulted in the gradual decline of Al Najada. Several of its historical buildings have been demolished. The Qatar Museums Authority has taken steps to preserve the cultural and architectural heritage of the district with its 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage') initiative. Most significant structures dating back to the early 20th century that still exist have been documented by the Origins of Doha Project. Some of the contemporary buildings dating to the late 20th century were intentionally designed with traditional elements of Qatari architecture in the interests of preserving the district's identity. Geography Al Najada borders the following districts: *Barahat Al Jufairi to the south, separated by Barahat Al Jufairi Street. *Old Al Ghanim to the east, separated by Grand Hamad Street. *Al Jasrah to the north, separated by Ali Bin Abdullah Street. *Mushayrib to the west. Landmarks Shops at Souq Najada Najada Souq Najada Souq, also known as the Mobile Phone Souq, was closed in 2012. It was announced in 2017 that the souq would re-open. A gold market containing 50 shops was inaugurated in the refurbished Najada Souq in July 2018. The new souq has an underground parking lot with 250 spaces. Sikkat Al Ihsan Sikkat Al Ihsan is a tapered street that connects Al Maymoun Street and Barahat Al Jufairi Street. Most of the residential units on this street are old, likely dating to the early 20th century, and provide good examples of vernacular architecture in Doha. Because of its long and mostly-undisturbed history, Sikkat Al Ihsan is considered a significant historic site of interest. Windtower house Windtowers are structures built to direct airflow in buildings. In the past, they were a common occurrence in Qatar, however, the rapid modernization of Doha has seen all other windtowers in the city demolished, leaving Al Najada's windtower as the last surviving one in Qatar's capital.

Career Attentive was commissioned in November 1804 under Lieutenant John Harris. He sailed her for the leeward Islands in May 1805. In July and early August 1806, Attentive was part of a squadron that included and , and that was under the command of Commander Donald Campbell (acting), in Lilly. Together, they supported General Francisco de Miranda in his quixotic and unsuccessful attempt to liberate the Viceroyalty of New Granada from Spain. Lieutenant Robert Carr replaced Harris, in 1807. In the spring of 1807, Attentives boats cut out two doggers, from the small port of La Trinité, Martinique. There was an English negro on board one who offered to pilot the British in to take an unprotected sloop with a cargo of sugar that was lying a few miles to the windward. That night, twelve men in two jolly boats set out to capture the sloop. Adverse tides made for slow going and it was only at dawn that they were able to enter the harbour. After one of the boats went in chase of a small craft, Lieutenant Cox, the overall commander of the cutting out party, suddenly noticed that a guarda costa was anchored between him and the sloop. The garda costas crew lined her sides and fired small arms at the British, but apparently did not fire the two 6-pounder guns that were pointing at their attackers. Cox and his five men nevertheless pushed forward and within minutes captured her. Cox then set sail and was able to rejoin Attentive within two hours. He had had only one man wounded in the attack.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, pp.5-6. At some point in 1807, Attentive captured a row-boat privateer in the Gulf of Paria. On 17 October 1807 Attentive was between Trinidad and Tobago when she encountered the Spanish privateer lugger Nuestra Senora del Carmen. Nuestra Senora was armed with two carriage guns, as well as swivel guns and small arms, and had a crew of 63 men under the command of Don Thomaso Lisaro. She also had 40 sweeps to propel her in a calm. During the encounter, she had three men wounded before she struck. She had left Barcelona only 15 days earlier and had captured the sloop Harriot, of St. Vincent. In October 1808, Attentive captured another small privateer, a row boat armed with one long gun and having a crew of 35 men. On 31 May 1809 Captain John Richards of sent boats from his small squadron under the command of Lieutenant Robert Carr of Attentive to capture a French letter of marque and a schooner from under the protection of four long- guns and 300 soldiers at the Port du Molas. Carr captured the vessels and then landed, spiked the guns, and blew up the French magazine.Marshall (1828), supplement, Part 2, p.16-17. A British squadron under Captain George Miller in arrived at Deshaies on 12 December 1809 to reconnoiter the harbour. There they found the French navy's brig Nisus about to leave, having loaded a cargo of coffee. Miller sent in boats with the marines from Thetis, , , and , and 78 sailors. The landing party first captured the fort at Deshaies, whereupon Nisus surrendered when its guns were turned on her. During the operation, Attentive kept up a six-hour cannonade on Nisus and the battery. Many of the 300 men in the battery fled, as did most of the crew of Nisus before the British could take possession. The British destroyed the battery before withdrawing. British casualties amounted to two men from Thetis being wounded on shore, and two men being wounded on Attentive. The Royal Navy took Nisus into service as HMS Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"13 Dec. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the boat action. In January and February 1810 Attentive participated in the British capture of Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign. Fate After returning to Britain, Attentive was laid up in Ordinary at Deptford until 1812. In August 1812 she was broken up.

Franz Hagenauer  While Karl was the principal designer of everyday objects (and some sculptures), his younger brother Franz specialized in sculpture. Franz Hagenauer also studied from an early age with Franz Cižek at Vienna's School of Applied Arts, and joined the family business at age twenty. His interest and talent lay in sculpture with sheet metals rather than cast figures, and later in his career he was head of metalwork and metal design classes at the Academy of Applied Arts. Franz took over the running of the company after Karl died in 1956.

It was first published in 1987, and was made into a 1998 motion picture of the same name starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. Plot summary George Mullen is a 20-something openly gay man enrolled in the English literature graduate school program at Columbia University. Although somewhat good-looking, George has moderate self-esteem problems and deep commitment issues. The novel is told from his point of view. The novel opens as George begins dating Robert Joley, a handsome, 40-year-old literature professor at the college. Joley (George always refers to him by his last name) also has commitment issues, and George's relationship with him is poor. They attend a party where George meets Nina Borowski, a full-figured woman who counsels battered women and rape victims at a women's crisis center while striving for her Ph.D. in psychology. Joley tells Nina that George wants to move out, even though the men have not discussed this. Angry and hurt, George moves into Nina's Brooklyn apartment. George drops out of Columbia, and takes a job teaching kindergarten alongside Melissa, a trust-fund baby into alternative culture. George and Nina swiftly become best friends, and in time their friendship comes close to approximating romantic love. They have a mutual appreciation for junk food, and both of them are highly disorganized, somewhat lazy, and tend to hoard things. They both enjoy movies, and they impulsively take ballroom dancing lessons. Nina is dating Howard, a feminist and legal aid lawyer. The plot changes when Nina tells George that she is pregnant with Howard's child. Nina does not want to marry Howard, and asks George if he will raise the child with her. George agrees. Despite Nina's request that Howard remain unaware of the pregnancy for now, George unintentionally lets the secret out. After a few weeks, Nina begins to break up with Howard, who is devastated. Although a year has now passed since George and Joley dated, Joley contacts George and asks him to vacation at an inn in Vermont. George eagerly consents. During the trip to Vermont, Joley reveals that he did not get tenure at Columbia, and asks George to move with him to Seattle, Washington. At last, George sees Joley as more pathetic than sexually attractive or mature. At the inn, George meets Paul Schneider, a Jewish newspaper reporter in Vermont. They spend the night together, and George meets Paul's adopted Salvadoran son, Gabriel. Joley returns to New York without George, and never contacts him again. Having returned to New York City, George learns that his co-worker Melissa is dating Howard. During the Thanksgiving holiday, Paul travels to New York City to visit his mother, Molly, and spends some time with George. Molly takes a strong interest in Nina. Soon thereafter, George allows a mother going through a nasty divorce to take her son home at the end of the school day. In fact, the mother is abducting her own child, which enrages the child's father. Melissa breaks up with Howard. George is suspended from his job just before Christmas, then travels to Vermont to spend Christmas with Paul. As the vacation ends, George tells Paul about being fired, and Paul is angry that George doesn't trust him. Back in Brooklyn, Nina is upset that George is falling in love with Paul. With Molly's encouragement, she has turned her life around by getting rid of clothes and mementos she has hoarded, and has begun work again on her dissertation. George and Nina's friendship becomes rocky, and they take up ballroom dancing lessons again. Frank, George's younger brother, invites George to his wedding. But George's family is shocked to find Nina pregnant; they had told Frank's soon-to-be in- laws that George was heterosexual. George and Nina decide not to attend the wedding. They travel by train back to New York City. They stop in Providence, Rhode Island, on the way home, get a room at an inn, and make love. The act of sexual intercourse ruins George and Nina's intimate friendship, as George had long suspected it would. The book ends with an epilogue, set about six months later. George has moved to Vermont to live with Paul, and taken a job as a kindergarten teacher there. Nina has had her baby, and named the child Emily. Melissa has gone to law school, and Paul's mother has moved in with Nina to help care for Nina's child. Nina has allowed Howard back into her life, to a limited degree, so that he can see his daughter. Main characters * George Mullen - narrator of the novel, and the 20-something protagonist. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, George has been out of the closet since college. George lacks self-esteem and is terrified of commitment, to his friends and to his boyfriends. George has several neuroses, is lazy, begins projects but rarely finishes them, and spends most of his free time listening to pop music from the 1950s. * Nina Borowski - A Polish American woman in her late 20s, and George's best friend. Nina is much like George (lazy, a hoarder, etc.), and rarely works on her doctoral dissertation. Like George, she is relentlessly cynical. * Howard - Nina's boyfriend. Howard is very liberal and a feminist, and often apologizes for things he says which he feels are offensive. He is a good cook, but somewhat slovenly in his attire. Howard is besotted with Nina, gives her suffocatingly saccharine pet names (such as Brisket, Butterbean, Munchkin, Pudding, and Puddle), and is somewhat overbearing. * Robert Joley - Referred to by George as \\"Joley\\", he is a handsome professor of literature at Columbia University. Joley is sexually promiscuous, and not committed to his relationship with George. When Joley does not get tenure, he shaves off his beard, which makes George realize how old, average looking, and sad Joley really is. George abandons Joley at the inn in Vermont, and Joley returns to New York City without George. * Paul Schneider - A tall, skinny, unkempt newspaper publisher and reporter in Vermont, Paul is Jewish and very liberal. A year earlier, he broke up with his lover, Robert. He has a six-year-old son, Gabriel, who is an orphan from El Salvador whom Paul adopted. Paul is immensely attracted to George, and although George's dissembling and attempts to push Paul away anger Paul, Paul patiently works to help George become more at ease with their relationship. Paul has a habit of attributing to Gabriel the feelings he himself has. * Melissa - George's co-teacher at the kindergarten, Melissa comes from a wealthy family and is very opinionated. She participates in alternative culture, and quits her job in protest when the kindergarten suspends George for nine months. * Molly Schneider - Paul's mother, she is a divorced woman who is a former member of the Communist Party USA. She spends most of her time as a political activist. * Timothy - George's best friend, and an architect. He is highly opinionated, critical of almost everyone and everything, and is so afraid of intimacy that he sets George up on blind dates with anyone who shows an interest in himself. * Gabriel Schneider - Nicknamed \\"Gabie\\", he is Paul's adopted son from El Salvador. He is very loud, and calls adults by their first name. Genesis of the novel In 1983, author Stephen McCauley was a student in the graduate writing program at Columbia University. He wrote a short story about gay man named George and straight woman named Nina and their attempt to deal with Nina's pregnancy. Stephen Koch, a professor of literature at Columbia, suggested expanding the short story into a book-length novel. The character of George shared many characteristics with McCauley himself, including his dislike of travel, his attendance at Columbia, and many aspects of McCauley's own personality. McCauley graduated from the University of Vermont (George travels there in the novel), and enrolled in several graduate programs in psychology (Nina is enrolled in one in the novel). McCauley said his novel was about how deeply selfish but generally good- hearted people must balance their needs against those of the people they love. \\"There is a sort of confusion in people's lives today—there are so many options,\\" he said. \\"Perhaps my generation has been brought up to think you have a right to want what you want and to do it all, and I don't think you can. You have to give up some piece of yourself. You can't be selfish when you raise a child or are with another person. You can't act purely on whimsy.\\" Critical reception Susan Fromberg Schaeffer, reviewing the novel for The New York Times, called it \\"very funny\\" and \\"exceptionally vivid\\". She said that McCauley \\"brings his characters, his world astonishingly, captivatingly alive.\\" Sarah Gold of the Los Angeles Times called the novel \\"warmly engaging\\". She found some of the characters too mannered rather than alive, while others were too thinly written. Although she found the ending disappointed, she also noted it was \\"a final, bittersweet encounter [which] rounds out [a] novel...full of wonderful moments, gentle humor, and a happily jaundiced view of contemporary attitudes and inanities.\\" An anonymous reviewer in The Washington Post called it a \\"quaint and quirky novel\\" with \\"wry and witty thrust-and-parry writing\\", but felt that McCauley never explained the basis for George and Nina's love and that the ending left the reader without resolution. The novel was named a \\"Bear in Mind\\" book by The New York Times, as one which the editors felt were of particular interest. The New York Times also named the novel one of its \\"Notable Books of the Year\\". Film Playwright Wendy Wasserstein optioned the novel for the screen in 1990. The feature film, The Object of My Affection, was released in October 1998.

Episodes Series overview Season 1 (2016) Season 2 (2017) Production Conception and development Sonar Entertainment and Farah Films acquired the TV rights to the Shannara universe in 2012. In December 2013, it was announced that a series based on the books was being produced for MTV and had been given a straight-to-series, 10-episode order. On April 20, 2016, MTV greenlit a second season of The Shannara Chronicles. The series is produced by Dan Farah, Jon Favreau, Miles Millar, Al Gough, Jonathan Liebesman, and author Terry Brooks. Brooks has stated in an interview that he is happy with the way his story has been adapted. Much like the television adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, the series will not be a direct adaptation following the narrative order of the books, but will feature a mix of the books' stories. The first book of the series to be adapted is The Elfstones of Shannara, the second book in the trilogy, with some elements of the other novels being gradually adapted to the show. Casting In December 2014, it was announced that Manu Bennett would star as Allanon and in January 2015 Ivana Baquero, Austin Butler, Poppy Drayton, Emelia Burns and John Rhys-Davies joined the show. Malese Jow, Vanessa Morgan, Gentry White, Desmond Chiam and Caroline Chikezie joined the cast as series regulars in season two.

Filming for the second season, which also consists of 10 episodes, began January 31, 2017, in New Zealand. Music The opening theme song, \\"Until We Go Down\\", from the EP \\"Up in Flames\\", is performed by Ruelle. Other songs featured in the show's first season include \\"Midnight\\" by Coldplay, \\"You Are a Memory\\" by Message to Bears, \\"Wave\\" by Beck and \\"Run Boy Run\\" by Woodkid. Release During The Shannara Chronicles panel at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2015, a teaser trailer was revealed, giving audiences a first look at the sets and characters. A television version of the trailer was shown during the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. Broadcast The Shannara Chronicles premiered on MTV in the United States on January 5, 2016, with a two-hour series premiere New episodes were broadcast every Tuesday at 10 pm ET. The third and fourth episodes were released online after the first two episodes aired on January 5, 2016, prior to their original broadcast schedule. The series was simulcast on MTV in Canada.

The series has also been licensed to a number of different countries, including the United Kingdom (airing on 5STAR), Australia (Syfy) and New Zealand (Sky TV).  Cancellation  On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons. Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks. The series was later considered officially concluded. Reception Critical response The Shannara Chronicles has received mixed reviews, receiving a 52/100 score on Metacritic, based on 15 reviews and a 54% for season 1 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"The Shannara Chronicles wears its influences heavily on its sleeve and needs to find surer footing before it can tap its true potential, but it still might suffice for viewers in search of a teen-friendly Game of Thrones.\\" The second season received a 100% approval rating based on five reviews. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \\"So give this reasonably absorbing series a little credit, even though it often seems to be merely reworking various fantasy formulas. It moves quickly and does a nice job of weaving together two story lines involving an elfin world that is threatened when a giant tree, known as the Ellcrys, begins to die.\\" Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote: \\"Sure, Shannara, which harks back to the golden age of syndicated genre fare, is a standard quest journey in which there are trolls, gnomes, living trees and magic books, and characters say things like, 'If Allanon is here, there are dark days ahead.' But there's conviction in the show's execution.\\" Ratings =Season 1 (2016)= =Season 2 (2017)= Accolades The series was nominated for a Saturn Award for \\"Best Fantasy TV Series\\" for the 2015–2016 season.

It was built in 1906 by A D Menzies. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This small weatherboard hall was erected in 1906 for the Anglican congregation in Toogoolawah, on land in Mangerton Street owned by Mary Elizabeth McConnel of Cressbrook. This site is now the vacant block to the south of the rectory, the hall having been moved to its present location beside the church. The town of Cressbrook Creek (later Toogoolawah) was founded when Mary McConnel's husband, JH McConnel, subdivided a large section of the Cressbrook estate in the late 1890s, and established a condensed milk factory on Cressbrook Creek in 1898. The town expanded when the Brisbane Valley railway line was completed in 1904 providing a connection to Ipswich. It is believed Mary McConnel paid for the construction of the hall. Probably the builder was AD Menzies, who erected most of the buildings in Toogoolawah until the mid-1920s. The hall was opened by the Archbishop in September 1906, and Anglican services were held there until St Andrew's Church was erected in 1911-1912. Subsequently the building became the Sunday School hall, and in 1920 the church purchased from Mrs McConnel both the hall and the site, for the sum of £100. The building has been moved since to its present location beside the church, and has undergone a number of alterations.  Description  This single-storeyed timber building is set amongst mature trees on a corner site forming the northwestern boundary to McConnel Park. St Andrew's Church is located on the northern side of the building and St Andrew's rectory and its grounds are to the south. The building has a corrugated iron gabled roof with a skillion roof to the rear kitchenette and a gabled roof to the front porch. The exterior is dark painted weatherboard, matching St Andrew's Church, and sits on timber stumps. The front porch has a solid weatherboard balustrade and a decorative timber front gable with a metal finial. The windows now have glass louvres and the timber trim is painted white. Internal walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting.  Heritage listing  St Andrew's Church Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Andrew's Church Hall, erected in 1906, is significant historically in illustrating the establishment of the Anglican Church in Toogoolawah. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, in particular the aesthetic contribution of building and grounds to the Toogoolawah townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a strong association with the Toogoolawah community, being an integral part of an historic, visually cohesive and picturesque precinct comprising St Andrew's church, church hall, and rectory and adjacent McConnel Park (containing the Toogoolawah War Memorial). The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. St Andrew's Church Hall has a special association with the McConnel family and their contribution to the development of social and religious life in Toogoolawah.

It was built in 1925. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This single-storeyed weatherboard house was constructed in 1925 as the rectory for St Andrew's Anglican Church in Toogoolawah. The Parish of Toogoolawah had been created in 1917, following division of the Esk parish into two, and reflected the population expansion which accompanied the success of Nestle's Toogoolawah condensed milk factory during the First World War. In 1920 Mary McConnel of Cressbrook Station, who in 1911 had donated the land on which St Andrews Church was subsequently erected, gave the parish a further two allotments in Mangerton Street, between the Church and the St Andrew's Church Hall, on which to build a rectory. In 1924 the parish asked for plans and specifications for a rectory to be prepared by the local builders, probably contractor AD Menzies, who erected many of the buildings in Toogoolawah until the mid-1920s. Work began in January 1925, and the house was completed in late May that year, at a cost of £1,008. The Anglican parishes of Esk and Toogoolawah were amalgamated as the Brisbane Valley parish in 1928, and the rector has resided since at Toogoolawah rather than at Esk.  Description  This single-storeyed timber building is set amongst mature trees, including some large palms, and the grounds form the southern part of the St Andrew's Church precinct and the northwestern boundary to McConnel Park. The building has verandahs on the north and west elevations and sits on concrete stumps with a semi-enclosed space beneath. The exterior is clad in weatherboard with timber battens between the exterior stumps. The wide verandahs have decorative timber valance and balustrades, with a deep and low railing which forms a seat. Entry is from the west via a quarter-turn stair with landing. The front door has decorative glass sidelights, fanlight and upper panel and opens into a foyer. A narrow study opens off the west verandah and has a gabled street elevation. This gable is repeated on the eastern elevation over the kitchen. Internally, walls are single skin VJ boards, and French doors with fanlights open onto the verandahs. Ceilings are boarded and a decorative lancet shaped, timber arch valance is located between the foyer and lounge. Window hoods are corrugated iron with timber brackets.

Originally premiering as a film at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival in May (and subsequently for international releases), it was broadcast in September 2014 as a miniseries on French television. A sequel, Coincoin and the Extra-Humans (Coincoin et les Z’inhumains), was made by Dumont in 2018, featuring most of the cast of the original film. Cast * Alane Delhaye as \\"P'tit Quinquin\\" * Lucy Caron as Eve Terrier * Bernard Pruvost as Van der Weyden * Philippe Jore as Rudy Carpentier * Philippe Peuvion as Quinquin's father * Céline Sauvage as Quinquin's mother * Lisa Hartmann as Aurélie Terrier * Julien Bodard as Kevin * Corentin Carpentier as Jordan Most of the cast was made up of natives of the Pas-de-Calais region, where the film is set, with little to no prior acting experience. Several of the cast members also have physical disabilities, such as Jason Cirot, who plays Quinquin's uncle Dany, or Bernard Pruvost, who has a tic disorder. Dumont responded to criticism that he was exploiting or ridiculing such individuals: \\"They're acting. We spent a lot of time rehearsing, and it's actor's work.\\" A repeating gag where Dany spins around before falling was suggested by Cirot: \\"Let's put this in, it's something I love doing.\\" According to Dumont, Provost's tics were more pronounced on- screen than off, due to a combination of nervousness and the use of an earpiece through which Pruvost received his lines: \\"The reason he keeps moving his head is because he's listening to what I'm saying in his ear.\\" Accolades The prestigious Cahiers du Cinéma featured P'tit Quinquin on their cover of the September issue and placed it as the best picture on the 2014 Top Ten chart. In 2019, the magazine placed the film at #3 on their Top Ten of the decade.

Location and history The building is situated at No. 7 on the Bund and was built by for Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company. This piece of land of size 724 square metres was originally the property of Russell & Company. On August 15 1881, the Great Northern Telegraph Company rented the original building on the site. The company set up first telephone switch in Shanghai within the building in 1882. With original building deteriorating, the company decided to build a new one on its site, designed by the architectural firm Atkinson & Dallas. However, a large fire in October 1905 atop the offices under construction and took over two hours to extinguish. The roof collapsed and the entire third floor and attic had to be rebuilt. This delayed the completion of the building for a whole year. The building, which eventually opened in January 1908, also housed the offices of the British owned Eastern Extension and the American owned Commercial Cable telegraph companies. The building housed some state-of-the art equipment at the time of its completion, including a pneumatic tube system to handle the telegrams and a lift made by Smith & Stevens of London. There were public telephones in the ground floor hall. Originally there were three Bund entrances leading to the respective company offices. The Great Northern Telegraph Company occupied the ground floor until 1921, when it moved to its newly completed building at 4 Avenue Edward VII (currently 34 East Yan'an Road), behind the Asia Building. In 1945, the Commercial Bank of China, which was previously next door at No. 6, moved into the building. The building was later used by the Yangtze River Shipping Company. Since 1995, the building is largely used by the Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited. The Royal Thai Consulate-General also occupied parts of the building until 2008.

It is located down the street from the Brunelleschi's church of Santa Maria degli Angeli. Facade on Via degli Alfani History The palace was erected on land once occupied by the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Margherita delle Romite di Cafaggiolo (no longer extant).Guida per la città di Firenze e suoi contorni edited by Giuseppe Formigli (1830), page 102. It was commissioned by Simone da Firenzuola from Ammanati in 1570 and completed in 1577. Ammanati also completed the building on Alfani #32. Simone had forbidden his children from selling the palace; however, lacking male descendants, in 1640, the palace came into the Giugni family with the marriage of Niccolò Giugni and Luisa Giraldi. At this time it was enlarged and two wings were added. A gallery was decorated using designs of Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, with stuccoes by Giovanni Martino Portogalli and ceiling frescoes by Alessandro Gherardini celebrating Medici support of the arts. The marchese Giugni served as Guardaroba Maggiore to the Grand-Duke of Tuscany. In 1830, the Giugni family sold the palace to the Della Porta family, and between 1829-1839, the English painter and writer Walter Savage Landor, resided with the family. Federico Fantozzi in his guide of Florence from 1842: described the palace as Beautiful, simple, and balanced in the facade, but more importantly, exceeding beautiful in the doric portal. The portal, with rusticated borders, is decorated with classical and other zoomorphic touches. Landor did criticize as a design flaw that the height of the portal exceeds the pediments above the windows. On the second floor in the center of the facade is the coat of arms of the Firenzuola made by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in 1950. The original shield is now located under the porch. The ground floor windows perch on Mannerist brackets. Beyond the courtyard is a small garden on the back wall characterized by the fountain of Giant overwhelmed by Boulders or Fall of Titan (1690) attributed to the sculptor Lorenzo Migliorini. Portal of the palace The palace underwent restoration complete by 1871 under the guidance of Emilio De Fabris,Florentine Palaces & Their Stories, by Janet Ross, page 116. and in the 1970s by Lando Bartoli.

During the battle, Takeda Motoshige was defeated by a young Mōri Motonari. It was Motonari's first battle.Arita Castle - Kitahiroshima-cho Tourist Information Website (Kitahiroshima-cho Tourism Association) Background In the early 16th century Takeda Motoshige (also known as Motoshigeru), a local lord of Aki Province, accompanied the daimyō Ōuchi Yoshioki, his liege lord, to restore Ashikaga Yoshitane to the shogunate in Kyoto. At some point around 1515 Motoshige returned to Aki and broke off from the Ōuchi, changing his allegiance to the Amago.Aki-Takeda family historical background (Hiroshima City Culture Foundation At this time the Mōri clan (a vassal of the Ōuchi), were neighbors of the Takeda in Aki. When Mōri Okimoto died in 1516, and was succeeded by his young son Komatsumaru, Takeda Motoshige took advantage of this and, in the following year, gathered an army of 5,000 and in October advanced into the territory of the Mōri's Yoshikawa allies and surrounded . A few weeks later, Motoshige dispatched a raid into the Mōri clan's territory and set fire to houses in . The Mōri clan's response was led by Mōri Motonari, younger brother to Okimoto and guardian of Komatsumaru.Gion west community center Web information station (Hiroshima future city creation Foundation people, town network part) Battle With most of the Ōuchi forces preoccupied in Kyoto with Ōuchi Yoshioki, the Mōri were unable to call on them for assistance, and Motonari instead mobilized his clan and called on their supporters. Motonari was also supported in this by his younger brother, Mototsuna. In total the Mōri strength comprised around 850 men, reinforced by 300 from the Yoshikawa, for a total of around 1,000. This force marched towards Arita Castle and on the way encountered the Takeda vanguard of about 500 men, commanded by Kumagai Motonao. The Mōri and their allies stood off and engaged the Takeda with archery fire. Kumagai Motonao was in the front ranks and was encouraging his men when he was struck and killed by an arrow. Takeda Motoshige was meanwhile with the main army at Arita Castle. Learning of Motojika's demise, he drew up his forces and marched to engage the smaller Mōri resistance. The Takeda encountered the Môri and Yoshikawa occupying the opposite bank of the Uchikawa River and a bitter struggle ensued. Heavily outnumbered, the Mōri-led forces began to falter and fall back, but they held in place only by Motonari's pleas to stand their ground. Takeda Motoshige himself advanced forward across the river on horseback but was struck by an arrow and killed. The Takeda broke and retreated, leaving Mori Motonari the victor.

The name seen in last place among the actors listed in the end credits of both episodes is \\"Michael Morris\\", a variation upon Marion Michael Morrison, which is the most frequently indicated form of Wayne's birth name.Rich, Michael. \\"The Colter Craven Story\\" at Fifties Web The central plotline of \\"Rookie of the Year\\" concerns a baseball player (portrayed by Ward Bond) who, decades earlier, was accused of throwing a game, which is also the key theme in \\"Flashing Spikes\\", in which the disgraced middle-aged former player is portrayed by James Stewart, with Wayne playing a cigar-chewing Marine sergeant umpiring a soldiers' baseball game on the sidelines of the Korean War, whose recognizable voice and figure, rather than his face (partially obscured by a baseball cap), provides the instant identification. The honorable sports reporter played by Wayne in \\"Rookie of the Year\\" decides against exposing Bond as the father of a talented young \\"rookie\\" player portrayed by Wayne's 16-year-old actor son, Pat Wayne who, seven years later (listed by his most frequent billing, Patrick Wayne), again portrays a similarly-positioned young player in \\"Flashing Spikes\\", where the snide, baseball-hating opportunist columnist at the opposite end of morality from John Wayne's character in \\"Rookie of the Year\\", is portrayed by \\"Colter Craven\\" himself, Carleton Young who, between 1958 and 1964, appeared in 5 John Ford films (The Last Hurrah, The Horse Soldiers, Sergeant Rutledge, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Cheyenne Autumn).Turnour, Quentin. \\"Flashing Spikes\\" (Senses of Cinema: Cinemateque Annotations on Film, Issue 31, April 2004) All three TV episodes also feature another member of the Stock Company, Willis Bouchey, who was in 9 Ford theatrical features between 1955 and 1964. In early 1962, about a year-and-a-half after directing \\"The Colter Craven Story\\", John Ford recreated a longer version of the General Grant–General Sherman scene for \\"The Civil War\\", the third of five segments comprising the Metrocolor Cinerama epic, How the West Was Won (three of the lengthy production's other storyline sections were directed by Henry Hathaway and one by George Marshall). The film, which held its initial public exhibition in Britain on November 1, 1962 (the US premiere was in February 1963), presented the scene in Cinerama's ultra-wide-screen perspective, but Ford still staged it in its 1960 television form, with extended dialogue content between Grant [played in How the West Was Won by Henry (Harry) Morgan, and in \\"The Colter Craven Story\\" by Paul Birch, who had previously portrayed both Ulysses S. Grant and his Confederate counterpart Robert E. Lee in episodes of other TV series] and Sherman (John Wayne), whose face is partially hidden in shadows throughout the conversation, in a manner reminiscent of its presentation in the TV episode.McBride, Joseph Wilmington, Michael. John Ford, pages 193-196 (Da Capo Press, 1975) Wayne, whose scene with Morgan lasts just under four minutes, receives 12th billing among the 13 alphabetically-billed top-tier stars of How the West Was Won and is again recognized more through his posture and distinctive vocal delivery, than by the indistinct sight of his unshaven face, mirroring his \\"Michael Morris\\" one-line performance as Sherman in \\"The Colter Craven Story\\".Arnold, Jeff. \\"The Colter Craven Story – episode of Wagon Train (NBC TV, series 4, 1960)\\" (Jeff Arnold's West, May 23, 2013) Although the film is occasionally listed as the sixth Carleton Young big screen performance under Ford's direction, Young's brief unbilled appearance (as a poker player with Gregory Peck) is in the second segment, \\"The Plains\\", directed by Henry Hathaway. Plot Doctor Colter Craven joins the wagon train As Major Adams (Ward Bond) leads his wagon train through Utah's Monument Valley (using footage from Ford's 1950 frontier adventure/western Wagon Master, which co-starred Bond), the trail cook, Charlie Wooster (Frank McGrath) informs the Major that the water supply is running low. At that point, the trail associate scout, Bill Hawks (Terry Wilson), rides up with news that he spotted smoke \\"three miles up ahead\\". When the Major asks him, \\"Fort Mescalero?\\" and then, \\"Think it's Apaches?\\", Hawks replies, \\"Well, Major, at thirty-two dollars a month, I ain't paid to think\\". The Major tells Hawks, \\"Hah, let's have a look. Come on\\". The source of the smoke turns out to be cooking fire alongside a broken-wheeled lone horseless wagon stranded in the wilderness. In the wagon, the Major and Hawks encounter a semi-drunken gentleman who introduces himself as Colter Craven (Carleton Young) and calls for his wife, Allaryce (Anna Lee), who addresses him as \\"Doctor\\". He tells the Major that as far as Fort Mescalero was concerned, \\"I'm wanted out of there\\" and adds, \\"Major, if we may join your train… in return for... our transportation... I can offer a compendium of my… medical services\\". He then continues, \\"Major, the only thing that really lies ahead is… tomorrow. And tomorrow comes regardless of which way we're headin'\\".\\"Major Adams: Trailmaster. The Colter Craven story\\" OCLC WorldCat Doctor Craven is unable to offer medical aid for a passenger expecting a difficult birth During an evening rest stop, Doctor Craven hears from Major Adams that the wagon train is still intent upon heading to Fort Mescalero and explains that he cannot return there because he had refused to remove an inoperable bullet from Buck Clayton — \\"the Claytons run this part of the world\\". At that point, Creel Weatherby (Cliff Lyons), whose wife is expected to give birth soon, runs to the Major for help. The Major heads to the doctor, but he protests that \\"in a party this large, there must be at least fifty midwives\\". When Creel insists, Craven turns to his wife to ask if she would mind \\"going with this gentleman and looking at his wife\\". Taking full measure of the doctor's alcoholism, Major Adams then tells him that \\"among other things, we don't allow whisky on this train, except that which is used for medicinal purposes — and that we carry on my wagon\\". Spotting the doctor's supply of kegs marked \\"XXX\\", the Major asks, \\"what's in these kegs?\\". The doctor replies, \\"why… ah… uh… that's… uh… Formaldehyde, sir\\". The Major says, \\"I want to see the heads of those kegs knocked in. On this train we don't have any use for… Formaldehyde\\". Inhospitable reception in Fort Mescalero In another scene from Wagon Master, which detailed a westward trek by a Mormon wagon train, men and women in Mormon garb are seen walking and riding through Monument Valley. The doctor and his wife are riding in the back of the Major's wagon, driven by Charlie. During the ride, the doctor reaches behind him to fill a cup from the \\"medicinal supply\\" barrel and shares a drink with Charlie. Upon arriving in Fort Mescalero, the Major tells Craven and his wife to \\"stay out of sight\\" and dips a bucket into the water trough. He is observed by Kyle (Ken Curtis) and his brother Quentin (Chuck Hayward) who shoots into the bucket. As the outraged Major demands an explanation, Kyle tells him that this is \\"our water\\" and Quentin calls him \\"Grandpa\\". The Major angrily exclaims, \\"Grandpa!\\", hits Quentin over the head with the bucket and slaps Kyle to the ground with the back of his hand. Chastened, Kyle tells him that \\"all this water belongs to us\\"…. \\"my pa…\\" The Major says, \\"Well then, shoulder up your sidekick and we'll go see your pa\\". As Quentin, holding his aching head, attempts to stand up, the Major kicks him in the posterior and shouts, \\"Come on, get up, there!\\" Reduced to helplessness, Kyle whines accusingly at the Major, \\"big bully\\". Major Adams bargains for water, Craven sets a boy's broken leg and the river is reached The Major, alongside the two humbled brothers, with Kyle holding up the unsteady Quentin, enters into a room where their aristocratically-mannered father, Park (John Carradine), wearing a dandified jacket atop a shirt with ruffled sleeves, is sitting on a throne-like chair at a heavily ornate table, building a house of cards, next to a mid-game chessboard. Slowly interrupting his task, he leans back and comments, \\"That's a most interesting tableau\\". The Major says, \\"I'm sorry I had to push your boys around out there, mister, but they were gettin' rambunctious\\". \\"My boys are simple enough without somebody hitting them on the head\\", replies Park. He subsequently offers to sell water at 25 dollars per barrel. \\"That's piracy\\", the Major shouts, offering a dime, maybe even 20 cents, stating \\"that water belongs to the Lord\\". Park is unmoved and responds, \\"the Lord didn't dig the wells — I did\\", but eventually an unspecified [the majority of scenes from the Fort Mescalero sequence were edited out] arrangement is reached allowing animals to be watered \\"at ten cents a head\\". The Major is forced to leave the fort without water, hoping to reach the nearest river before the trail's meager supply is gone. In the evening, as the wagons are stopped, an injured little boy, Jamie (Dennis Rush) is brought to Doctor Craven. With the boy's worried mother (Beula Blaze) watching, Craven skillfully diagnoses a broken leg and quickly sets it with splints. Bill Hawks suggests letting the thirsty horses loose and, as they stampede to the nearest river (in still another scene from Wagon Master), Bill follows them and is able to pinpoint the shortest, but hilly and barely passable, route to water. Footage of Mormon travelers is shown, as they walk alongside their wagons in Monument Valley. The terrain is very rough and the Major's wagon crashes and breaks apart. Extended excerpts from Wagon Master show the wagons moving through uneven rocky pathways, while horses are whipped and men are shouting. Finally, the river is reached and the Mormons drink and splash while their horses stand in water. The Major tells Charlie that the subject of his Sunday sermon will be \\"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\\" is pushes him off his horse into the river. Doctor Craven explains that the Civil War left him a broken man In the evening, Creel runs to inform Craven that his wife is ready to give birth. The doctor asks, \\"can't some of the women handle this?\\", but Allaryce tells him, \\"I've examined the woman. A caesarian section is indicated\\". Craven refuses to operate, even when Allaryce threatens to leave him if he does not help. As Major Adams tries to reason with him, Craven recounts that he could never perform proper surgery and that he paid for medical school with a job at a slaughterhouse. He tells the Major, \\"I graduated just in time for the war… Shiloh… eighteen thousand casualties… in that one campaign, seventy-two percent of my patients died…\\" The Major tells him, \\"…shock and gangrene… that wasn't your fault…\\" and continues, \\"…who do you think you are to sit in judgment of yourself?… what makes you think that you ought to be infallible?… what right have you got to make yourself personally responsible for the war?… I was at Shiloh… I had two hundred and twenty-three men… every one of them friends and neighbors… I came out with seventeen…\\" Major Adams tells Doctor Craven about his own Civil War experiences The Major has Charlie serve coffee, tells the doctor to sit down and says, \\"Let me tell you about a fella that I knew once, fella tried to solve his problem the same way you're tryin' to solve yours… He was in the Army… Captain… resigned his commission six years before the war…\\" The scene dissolves into a view of a Mississippi steamboat. The Major's voice continues, \\"I was in a little town in Illinois — Galena\\"… Bill Hawks and I had a little lumber outfit…\\" They see a man (Paul Birch), who Adams greets as Sam. Sam tells him, \\"I just came home, that's all\\". When Adams offers to buy him a drink later, Sam says, \\"Seth... I guess you came to the right man with that offer\\". He then goes to a woman waiting for him with two children. He embraces her and then the children. Two nosy townsmen, Hank (unbilled Hank Worden) and Jeb (unbilled Charles Seel) approach and tell Adams that \\"ol' Sam… got hisself kicked out of the Army… folks say he was doing' a little too much drinkin'… a regular drunk…\\" With a disgusted expression on his face, Adams responds that although he doesn't believe it, \\"folks say\\" that Jeb's \\"poor ol' ma died in a workhouse\\" and that Hank's young sister is \\"workin' in a dancehall down in St. Louis\\", which makes the two gossipers scurry away. Sam's father (Willis Bouchey) and mother (unbilled Mae Marsh, who appeared in 17 Ford films between 1939 and 1964 — more than any other actress) sternly accept his return, with the father offering Sam a job in his tanning store, telling him, \\"...even though you are a failure…\\" A few years pass… Bill Hawks goes into Sam's father's tanning store and asks Sam the price of a saddle. Sam tells him the saddle is worth about fourteen dollars, but \\"we're asking thirty-two fifty for it\\". Sam's father appears, pushes Sam aside and offers to sell it for forty dollars, then thirty-eight, then thirty-six. As Bill leaves without buying, Sam follows him outside and sees Adams drilling volunteer soldiers for the war that is expected to start soon. Walking into a local establishment's drinking area, Adams sees Sam at the bar and tells him that training raw recruits is a thankless task. Sam asks, \\"What's your rank, Seth?\\". \\"Sergeant major, Sam\\", Adams answers. Sam tells him, \\"You can lick boys, Seth, but you've got to lead men\\". Adams invites Sam to do a better job of training the raw recruits and Sam accepts. He stops drinking and, still wearing his tanner's apron, goes out and tells Adams to \\"take your post\\" in line with the men. He asks a man in uniform who has a big, wide smile on his face (unbilled Jack Pennick, who appeared in 41 Ford films [between 1928 and 1962], the highest number of any member of the Company), \\"Is that you Tim Molloy?\\". \\"Yes, sir\\", answers Molloy. Sam mentions how they served together in \\"Mexico, Chapultepec\\" and tells the men to observe how \\"to execute the manual of arms\\" as he puts Malloy through his paces and, over Adams's objections, tells him, \\"Molloy, you are now acting first sergeant\\". As the men march through the streets of Galena, Adams' voice is heard narrating, \\"In about a month, Sam had just worked wonders with that bunch of bedraggled misfits…heh…heh… they were ready for anything… and it was just in time, too, cause the Rebs had fired on Fort Sumter… and the Civil War was on\\". Sam turns out to be a historical figure Seen wearing a resplendent uniform, with a sword, Adams continues with his voiceover, describing how Galena residents organized a send-off ceremony, \\"I was a proud man that day standing' on that platform, sayin' goodbye to our congressman, the mayor and his wife and our friends and neighbors\\". Sam is also there and tells Adams, \\"I'm going with you as far as Springfield… I got a job in the governor's office… clerk… sharpening lead pencils…\\" As Adams prepares to lead his men out, Sam glances at the crowd, which includes his father and mother whose stern expressions still express disapproval, and embraces his little son and daughter. To his wife's question, \\"You aren't discouraged?\\", he replies, \\"no\\", and when she adds, \\"You'll be home soon\\", he says, \\"I'll be back\\". As the uniformed group marches towards the riverboat to the tune of \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\", Sam joins them as the last marcher. Accompanied by an image of a night battlefield, Adams' voice is heard proceeding with the story, \\"I didn't run across Sam again until just after Shiloh [April 6–7, 1862]… one of the worst days in American history… over thirty thousand casualties… that first night I was out lookin' for my wounded…\\" Adams meets Sam on the battlefield and lights Sam's cigar, illuminating his face. Sam tells Adams, \\"they run out of lead pencils… I managed to wangle my way back into the Army\\". As Adams asks Sam to take the second lieutenant's job held by Tim Molloy who was killed that day, Sam grimly replies, \\"I don't know, Seth… after today I'm not so sure I'm qualified to be a second lieutenant\\". As Adams persists, three uniformed men, indistinctly seen in darkness, arrive on horseback, with one of them dismounting and stating (in John Wayne's familiar voice), \\"Sam, Buell's up… Means we can resume fighting' in the mornin'\\". As \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" is gently heard on the soundtrack, Sam says, \\"Yes, we can resume in the morning… Cump... Colonel Lawler... I'd like you to meet a fellow townsman of mine, Major Seth Adams… General Sherman…\\" \\"Sam\\", Adams abashedly interjects, \\"I'm just a lieutenant\\". \\"Battlefield promotion, Seth\\", Sam says softly, \\"you've earned it… let's go, Cump… God bless you, Seth\\". Major Adams' Civil War experiences help Doctor Craven to confront his own demons \\"Ulysses Simpson Grant, Sam Grant\\", Adams' voice is heard, as he is now seen telling Doctor Craven the finishing words of his reminiscence concerning General Grant and the nickname he was known to his friends by, and, \\"and now he's the President of these United States of America [served March 1869 – March 1877]… he had a lot more responsibility than you doc… he used that responsibility… to redeem himself…\\" Craven is still unable to terms with his emotional disarray and grasping a scalpel in his fist, pitifully demands of Adams, \\"What am I going to do with a hand that can only hold a knife that way?\\" Adams stares angrily at him and replies, \\"You can cut your throat\\", then rises and walks aside. Craven's hand opens and is finally able to properly grasp the scalpel he was holding. He calls for his wife who tells him, \\"Colter, your patient is waitin'\\".Edwards, Ethan.\\"The Colter Craven Story\\" (DukeWayne.com, March 20, 2013) Another scene from Wagon Master depicts numerous people, horses and wagons moving through Monument Valley and then, during a rest stop, Creel distributes cigars to the Major, Charlie, Bill and Doctor Craven, telling him that although he planned to name his newborn son after Robert E. Lee, \\"Myra and I would like your permission to name 'im after you\\". Craven thanks him, \\"but I would prefer that you name him after a very special hero of mine, Ulysses Simpson Grant\\". \\"Why, that's a Yankee name\\", shouts Creel but, with Adams, Charlie, and Bill glaring sternly at him, quickly warms up to the idea. As Charlie grabs all the remaining cigars, the Major yells at him and then turns on Bill, \\"and what do you get paid for?\\" \\"So you can yell at me\\", Bill shouts back into the Major's face. In ever-increasing close-up, the Major enthusiastically yells, \\"All right, everybody… let's get our teams hitched up… we pull outa here in fifteen minutes… come on, we gotta river to cross… Wagoooooooons hoooooooo…..\\".Jones, Don. \\"Ward Bond -- He Was 1960 Version of Maj.

Eliminated scenes Seventeen or eighteen minutes were edited out of the 72-minute cut delivered by Ford, thus accounting for the abrupt nature of some of the scenes, particularly the Fort Mescalero storyline, including the excision of Chuck Roberson's entire performance as \\"Junior\\", eldest son of the John Carradine character, \\"Park\\", whose own single scene is the only remaining segment of a more complex eliminated sequence revolving around Dr. Craven's earlier mention of his refusal/inability to provide treatment for the deadly bullet wound suffered by Park's son \\"Buck\\".

A different Palazzo Panciatichi-Ximenes or Ximenes-da Sangallo is located at Borgo Pinti 68, corner of via Giusti, in Florence. History A large house was built at this site by Agnolo di Ghezzo della Casa at the end of the fourteenth century. Excavations at the site located the remains of an 11th-century bridge over the former river Mugnone. In 1618, the property was bought by Capponi, then in 1621, by the wealthy merchant Bandino Niccolò Panciatichi, who commissioned two terraces and moved the portal. In 1696, Cardinal Bandino Panciatichi, living in Rome, commissioned Carlo Rainaldi and Francesco Fontana to design a remodeling. The work was forwarded by Antonio Maria Ferri and Paolo Falconieri, who completed the interior in 1697. In 1741 some rooms inside were painted by Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, Vincenzo Meucci and Pietro Anderlini, other rooms were decorated in 1750 by Niccolò Agostino Veracini and Vincenzo Torrigiani. Between 1742-1757, the palace underwent further expansion of the palace directed by Giulio Mannaioni. Around the mid- nineteenth century, the descendants of the Panciatichi moved to a palace in Borgo Pinti, and converted the rooms of the palace into apartments. In 1910 the property was sold to Cattolica Assicurazioni, then to the National Institute of Insurance (Istituto Nazionale di Assicurazione). Rented in part in 1960 to the Education Authority, the complex was later to house the Regional Council of Tuscany, which still has its headquarters there. To this end, the building was remodeled by Franco Bonaiuti between 1972 and 1973. The palace now is connected to the adjacent Palazzo Capponi Covoni. At one corner is an aedicule with a Madonna and Child by Desiderio da Settignano (original in the National Museum of the Bargello). At other corners are the coat of arms of the Panciatichi.Palazzo Spinelli website, Firenze Beni Culturali office.

The city and a citizens' action group tried to revitalize the department store which in 2012 housed only a beauty shop. In 2013, a private investor was found, who would like to obtain the facility as a universal department store, as the Department Store of Upper Lusatia (, KaDeO) and thus a counterpart to the Berlin department store Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe).\\"Professor Stöcker und sein Traum vom Luxus-Kaufhaus\\", by Steffen Gerth, ', 29 July 2013 \\"KaDeO – das Kaufhaus in Görlitz\\" by Liane Watzel, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, 6 February 2014  History   Construction  Located on the present site in 1717 was the \\"Goldener Strauß\\" (Golden Ostrich) inn, which later was expanded into a hotel. The Görlitz city council wanted a department store on this site and in fact followed the model of the Berlin Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz. The Potsdam architect Carl Schmanns provided the construction plans for the \\"department store at the ostrich.\\" In 1912, after the demolition of the hotel, the new construction began as a steel skeleton which received a facade entirely based on the desired model in Art Nouveau. After nine months of construction time, the department store was opened on September 30, 1913. The management of the store lay in the hands of a small middle class firm.  1929 to 2010  Interior, 2008 In 1929 Rudolph Karstadt AG acquired the department store. The Karstadt owners were ousted after the Second World War and in 1950 the store was acquired by the German Democratic Republic, which let it be run by the state Handelsorganisation (HO). In 1958, it became a and consequently was part of an entire chain of such department stores in several cities of the GDR. In 1984, HO began the restoration of the historic facade and the interior rooms. After reunification the department store was given back to the Karstadt group. In subsequent restructuring of the company, it was put into the Karstadt Kompakt division, which was sold on October 1, 2005, to a British investment group, the Dawnay Day group. On March 1, 2007, these stores received the historical name \\"Hertie\\", as did the Görlitz department store. On 20 May 2009 Hertie owner Dawnay Day announced that this and all other Hertie branches would close by the end of July. The city searched for a new investor for the building. On 3 June 2009 federal chancellor Angela Merkel announced that the department store was detached from Hertie's insolvency and was to be individually sold. An investor from Great Britain took it over; however, in 2010 it was again abandoned. Thus the historically-listed building closed its doors. At the request of the city, from 8 February 2010 the building was in receivership to solve the problem of its further use more quickly. Apart from a reopening as a department store, use as a museum was also discussed. The vacant building was repeatedly a victim of vandalism. A citizen's initiative has even formed to rescue the department store; however, it has not found a solution.  Range  The department store last sold clothing, candy, furniture, and other types of products except for groceries. Because of the closeness of the border with Poland, all the signs were written in two languages. Some of the salespeople were fluent in both languages. Euro and złoty were equally accepted for payment.  Fresh start  In June 2013 Winfried Stöcker acquired the department store. It should again be operated as a department store. The reopening was planned for 2016, then for the fall of 2017, until it became clear that a sizeable restoration and renovation would be necessary first. It is unclear when this will begin and when a new warehouse might open in the building.Miriam Schönbach, \\"Görlitzer Jugendstil-Kaufhaus vor Sanierung\\", Lausitzer Rundschau, 27 August 2017.

He won the 1997 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bull Riding World Championship, and is the inventor of Rodeo Judge, the original rodeo card game. He is also a co-founder of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). Early life and career Mendes was born in Visalia, California in 1969, but later moved to Turlock. He started riding bulls at the age of five during a family ranch branding session. Scott’s grandfather, Frank Mendes, was a charter member of the predecessor Cowboys Turtles Association, where he competed at Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden in New York City. His father, Alan Mendes rode bulls, but mostly stayed close to home and never really ventured too far from the family ranch. Scott was surrounded by athletic talent within his family. His older brother Mike played football and younger brother Tony also rode bulls. Both Scott and Tony qualified for the PRCA’s National Finals Rodeo (NFR) and PBR World Finals. Scott, who was a co-founder of the PBR, qualified for the PBR World Finals in 1994 and 2001, the latter of which was the only year in which he and Tony qualified together for a world championship event. Mendes moved to Nevada with his father after his parents' divorce. Mendes won Nevada State High School bull riding titles in 1985 and 1986. He also qualified for the High School National Finals. In 1988 he finished 2nd to David Berry from Oklahoma for the PRCA bull riding rookie after only having his card for two months. Mendes' breakout season came in 1991 when he won the short round and first place in the average at Cheyenne Frontier Days on the 1992 PRCA Bucking Bull of the year, \\"Rocky\\", owned by Dan Russell. During his professional career, he qualified for the NFR five times, the Bull Riders Only (BRO) World Finals twice and the PBR World Finals also twice. He also competed in Championship Bull Riding (CBR). Mendes reached the pinnacle and milestone of his bull riding career in 1997 when he won more money than any other bull rider in the PRCA and was crowned the World Champion for said organization that year. His last known professional bull ride attempt was at a PRCA rodeo in Sonora, Texas in mid-August of 2005. Personal life Soon after the death of his fellow bull rider and good friend, Brent Thurman (who died from injuries suffered at the 1994 National Finals Rodeo), Mendes became a \\"born again\\" Christian. He responded by wanting to spread the word amongst many of his fellow rodeo cowboys. He and his wife, Angel, are founders, owners and operate Western Harvest Ministries. The national headquarters is an outreach ranch located in Weatherford, Texas. It serves as the foundation for a Christian bull riding league and training camp. Mendes met his wife Angel during his rise to fame riding bulls. He has two sons, Kaden and Kolten, and a daughter Jorden. His children also exhibit various rodeo talents. Philosophical and/or political views Mendes is the Pastor of Western Harvest Ministries, and founder of several Christian organizations building cowboy character for youth. He also travels throughout the country ministering in several churches, and is a corporate motivational speaker. He has made several television appearances on worldwide Christian stations, such as Trinity Broadcasting Network. Published works Mendes is a producer of several Christian films, and is the chair for the Fort Worth Christian Media Association. Mendes has also been in several Christian and western films, some of which he helped produce. Mendes is a partner/co-owner in Wings of Eagles Studios, a media group that is restoring \\"The Code of the West\\" and American family values to films and media. Their first movie Gold Score is a story about a Texas family, bull riding, and broken dreams. It was written by award-winning country western songwriter Terrance Alan and screenwriter Phil Merna, who is a Montana cowboy and former bull rider. In June 2015, he developed a mobile card game called Rodeo Judge with his partner from Christgames.org. It is loosely based on the game of 21. The idea came to him during his rodeo days.

Conjointly, the companies were among the largest manufacturers and suppliers of American military pressed fiber sun helmets during World War II. In the post-war period, the company made an early entry into the emerging plastic injection molding industry, making the transition in material production from fiber to plastic goods. During the 1960s, the company designed and patented advances in methods of producing pulp articles in the plastics industry. Concurrently, General Fibre became a supplier to Ford Motor Company, in the manufacture of plastic interiors. The General Fibre Company closed in 1985. History When the United States entered World War II, Hawley Products Company and the International Hat Company were commissioned to produce tens of thousands of military sun helmets for the war effort. George Tilles Jr., the President of International Hat turned to General Fibre Company's President L.T. Apple to supply all the fiber materials for the production of International Hat's pressed fiber military helmets. Over 100,000 pressed fiber helmets were supplied to soldiers of the United States Marine Corps and Navy. From World War II to the Gulf War, these pressed fiber pith helmets are noted for the historic length of their combat usage in the United States, outlasting combat usage of the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years. The pressed fiber helmet thus has the longest duration of combat usage of any helmet in the history of the United States military. The helmets were produced through the Vietnam War. However, later models of International Hat military helmets were made of plastic, after General Fibre converted to plastic injection molding. Products M1 Steel Helmet Liner During World War II, Hawley Products Company was a major producer of the M1 steel helmet. General Fibre received the subcontract to produce approximately 120,000 of the fiber linings for the M1 steel helmets manufactured by Hawley Products. Ariduk brand General Fibre began manufacturing decoy ducks under the Ariduk brand in 1946. The company mass produced mallards, pin tails, blue bills, black ducks, canvasbacks, oversized mallards, and oversized black ducks. General Fibre also produced two species of Canada goose decoys and two types of crow shooter's kits. The ducks were of fiber material with realistic glass eyes, a seamless base, and anchor hooks installed on the bottom. The fiber materials were water proof and constructed to withstand poor weather conditions. Likewise, the ducks were able to withstand being shot without sinking or leaking. In the early 1960s, the company stopped making the fiber version of all Ariduk decoy models, switching to plastic. Presidents *Lewis Tilles Apple (1941–1958) *Frank G.

Biography Born in Baden-Baden into a Jewish family, his parents were cellist Bernhard Cossmann and his wife Mathilde Hilb, the daughter of a Karlsruhe merchant. He never married. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1905, and subsequently was a devout practitioner of the faith. The elder Cossmann had been working in Moscow, but returned to his native country so that his son could be educated \\"as a German in Germany\\". While a gymnasium student in Frankfurt, he became a friend and devoted admirer of Hans Pfitzner; the two were the same age. He studied the natural sciences and philosophy, with a focus on Arthur Schopenhauer, and settled on a career in journalism. He launched Süddeutsche Monatshefte in Munich in 1903, leading it for the next three decades and soon establishing the review as one of the leading German cultural magazines of its day. During World War I, he intransigently promoted victory for Germany, while the magazine's special editions propelled its circulation upward, both on the front and among civilians. He retained a nationalist outlook in the wake of the German defeat, joining Münchener Neuesten Nachrichten as a political adviser in 1921. Cossmann's tireless struggle against the Treaty of Versailles and campaigns about the related topics of war debt (1922) and the stab-in-the-back myth (1925) earned him the reputation of a ruthless nationalism. He was falsely accused of pursuing causes on behalf of a political party or wealthy backers, but in fact Cossmann acted from conviction. While the stab-in-the-back furore served to poison the political atmosphere, he had actually sought to integrate German workers into the societal mainstream. While a fanatic when it came to his version of the truth, he was reportedly an unusually kind man possessed of warm social feeling, as well as a tireless promoter of charitable initiatives. He was imprisoned in March 1933 for more than a year as an unconditional opponent of Adolf Hitler. From 1934 to 1938, he lived in seclusion in Isartal, studying the Church Fathers. In 1938, he was sent to a Munich-area concentration camp for Jews. In the summer of 1942, already seriously ill, he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he soon died in the hospital. During his stay there, he consoled and spiritually strengthened his fellow inmates, some of whom revered him as a saintly figure.

Fighting between loyalists and rebels continued until Macías Nguema was captured fleeing for Cameroon on August 18. He sentenced his uncle to death for the crime of genocide against the Bubi people and other crimes committed. Macías Nguema was executed by firing squad on September 29, 1979. Teodoro has remained President since then. Background After Francoist Spain granted Equatorial Guinea independence in 1968, a power struggle between Macías and Atanasio Ndongo Miyone led to the former assuming the presidency. Ndongo attempted a coup the following year; he was captured and executed, and the backlash to the presumed Spanish involvement in the coup led to a mass exodus of Spanish natives from the country. Macías subsequently consolidated national political authority, making himself the totalitarian dictator of the country. Macías' reign as dictator was marked by his extensive use of state violence against his political opponents, Nigerian migrant workers, and minority ethnic groups, particularly the Bubi people. An estimated 35,000-50,000 people died during Macías' time in power, many of them in mass killings or imprisonment in the country's notorious prison camps, and, by 1979, 25% of the country's population lived in exile. The coup In the summer of 1979, Macías ordered several members of his own family killed. This led Obiang and several other members of Macías' inner circle to fear that Macías was no longer acting rationally. Obiang was Macías' nephew, as well as the brother of one of the victims. Obiang, who also served as deputy defense minister, overthrew his uncle on August 3, 1979. The coup was backed by the nation's military and Macías' Cuban palace guard; several foreign embassies, including those of Spain and the United States, were aware of the plot in advance and provided financial humanitarian aid in its aftermath. Upon his ouster, Macías and his personal bodyguard fled to Macías' home village of Nzeng-Ayong and took up residence in a fortified bunker protected by military loyalists. The ensuing conflict between Obiang and Macías' forces killed 400 people; it ended when Macías burned his personal treasury and fled toward the Cameroon border. A force led by naval commander Florencio Mayé captured Macías on August 18, and he and six of his allies were executed on September 29. Obiang has remained president of Equatorial Guinea since the coup.

In 2000, Ayre launched online gambling company Bodog, the success of which made him a billionaire. Ayre's notoriety increased in the mid-2000s as online gaming's popularity surged, landing him on the cover of Forbes magazine's 2006 annual Billionaires edition and Star magazine's \\"Most Eligible Billionaire Bachelors\\" list in late 2007. Ayre modeled his personal brand after Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. In 2012, Ayre was indicted by the US Attorney for Maryland on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering. Despite the Antiguan government’s view that the charges against Ayre were “completely contrary to binding international agreements,” in 2017, he pled guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and all other charges against him were dropped. In August 2017, Ayre was appointed as an Economic Envoy for Antigua and Barbuda to advise on developments in cryptocurrency. Early life Ayre grew up on a farm outside Lloydminster, Saskatchewan and graduated from high school in Salmon Arm, British Columbia. His parents were grain and pig farmers. In 1984, he received a bachelor of science (BSc) in general sciences from the University of Waterloo, adding an MBA in management finance from City University of Seattle in 1989. Career In 1992, after reading a newspaper article about a Caribbean-based company offering betting services over the telephone, Ayre concluded that gambling was tailor-made for the internet. Having taught himself network design by studying Cisco Systems manuals, Ayre converted his Vancouver-based Internet incubator company into a software support firm for online gambling, which became Bodog. He was able to license his software to several online casinos but soon realized the real money was in running his own gaming operation. His gambling business was setup in 1996 and was based in Costa Rica. Bodog.com was established in 2000. Canadian Business reported \\"the Bodog name is part of an ambitious branding strategy that Ayre envisioned from the start. He came up with it while typing potential brand names into an Internet domain- registration search engine one night. He chose the appellation like a major corporation would pick the name of a new car or brand of soft drink: it had to have six letters or less, be easy to spell and remember, have some personality and be unlike any competitor's moniker. The last criterion was easy to fill since most of Bodog's rivals prefer straightforward brand names such as PartyPoker.com or Sportsbook.com.\\" As the face of the Bodog brand, Ayre's public profile increased in the mid-2000s as online gaming’s popularity surged. He was featured as the cover story for Forbes 2006 annual Billionaires edition. and Star magazine’s \\"Most Eligible Billionaire Bachelors\\" list in late 2007. Ayre chose to make himself the focus of Bodog's marketing strategy, creating a public profile designed to showcase the trappings of a jackpot- winning lifestyle. He hosted lavish parties in Costa Rica and Antigua, with bikini-clad \\"Bodog Girls\\" and armed bodyguards in attendance, and the media noted his reputation as a man who likes to party. The Bodog website and press materials are filled with photographs of Ayre drinking on yachts with scantily clad models, partying with celebrities and living what he called \\"the Bodog lifestyle.\\" Ayre claims that the ‘bad boy adventurer’ image projected in Bodog marketing only worked because it was based on something genuine. \\"The lifestyle I sell is about 80% the reality of what I live.\\" The business expanded rapidly, recording turnover of and revenue of in 2005. As Bodog grew in prominence, Ayre appeared on episodes of MTV Cribs, VH1's Fabulous Life of…, Extra, and ABC Nightline. In 2006, Ayre was named one of People magazine's 40 hottest bachelors and appeared on the cover of the Forbes Billionaires issue. In a 2009 interview, Ayre stated that following the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006, the organization that he led and that had been accepting customers from the United States withdrew from that market, instead licensing the brand to the Morris Mohawk Gaming Group, which then operated its own online gaming website servicing the US under the Bodog brand until December, 2011. On 14 December 2011 MMGG announced that it would no longer operate Bodog-branded websites and transitioned all customers to its new site. The news media has also reported on Bodog's alleged skirting of Internet gambling laws in the United States and other countries. Forbes reported his \\"taunting analysis of the law: we run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in. But when you add it all together, it's Internet gambling.\\" In a 2006 feature, The Register called Ayre \\"something of an outlaw.\\" Expansion beyond gambling Ayre expressed his admiration for Virgin Group founder Richard Branson’s use of his personal brand to promote his companies. Using him as a model, Ayre sought to build Bodog into not only one of the largest online gambling brands but also a \\"mainstream 21st-century digital entertainment conglomerate\\". As Bodog grew, Ayre launched several non-gaming properties under the Bodog brand. In 2003, Ayre organized BodogConference.com in Las Vegas for sports handicappers, at which National Football League Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana was a special guest. The conference became an annual event, attracting gambling industry executives and figures from the sports world. In 2005, Ayre launched the Bodog Music record label. This led to the Bodog Music Battle of the Bands television series on Fuse TV, in which celebrity judges including former Sex Pistols singer John Lydon traveled across America to find the country's best unsigned bands. Ayre also launched Calvin Ayre WildCard Poker, a televised poker series on Fox Sports Net featuring pro and celebrity players facing off against online qualifiers. In March 2006, filming of party scenes for the first-season finale at Ayre's compound outside San Jose, Costa Rica, was raided by an estimated 100 police who were under the mistaken impression gambling was taking place. Ayre, who was not charged, used the media spotlight provided by the raid to promote the series and the Bodog brand. He made light of the raid, claiming the police \\"ate half my buffet.\\" Bodog branched out into sports with the launch of Bodog Fight, a mixed martial arts league incorporating a television series and live pay-per-view events. The 2007 finale in St. Petersburg, Russia, was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. In 2018, Ayre revealed plans to build a $100 million five-star resort on Antigua's Valley Church beach. He claimed that the project would be entirely funded by profits he made from trading Bitcoin, of which he was an early investor. As of 2018 Ayre is involved with Bitcoin SV. Retirement and reemergence In 2006, the online gambling industry underwent realignment as US authorities made high-profile arrests of several online gambling executives. Ayre sold Bodog's US-facing online gambling business to the Morris Mohawk Gaming Group of Kahnawake, Quebec, with Ayre retaining rights to the Bodog brand. He subsequently announced his retirement from the online gambling business. In November 2019, Ayre opened Canada Place, a $40 million, five-story office complex in St. John’s, Antigua that will host up to 600 workers by 2020. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne called Canada Place, which features a solar panel array that generates over 500 kilowatts of energy, “easily the most impressive building on the island, hands down.” Criminal charges In February 2012, Ayre and three other individuals were indicted by the US Attorney for Maryland on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering related to conduct that occurred before the 2006 passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). Ayre released a statement via CalvinAyre.com saying he viewed the indictment as \\"abuse of the US criminal justice system for the commercial gain of large US corporations.\\" Ayre also noted that the US Attorney had seized Bodog.com, a domain that had been dormant since the Bodog brand revoked its licensing agreement with MMGG the previous year. In July 2017, US federal prosecutors dropped the remaining charges against Ayre and Bodog after Ayre pled guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and admitted to an accessory after the fact charge related to the transmission of gambling information in violation of the federal Wire Act. The Bodog.com domain has since been returned to its owners with an accompanying payment of $100,000, after it had been seized by US federal prosecutors as part of the criminal case. Judge Catherine Blake sentenced Ayre to one year of unsupervised probation and a $500,000 fine. In September 2017, think tank Democracy Institute published Patrick Basham's case study slamming US trade hypocrisy over online gambling dispute with Antigua-Barbuda. The report calls the US government's prosecution of Ayre highly irregular, ill-advised, and unsuccessful. The study states that Ayre's conviction ran afoul of the WTO's ruling as to America's General Agreement on Trade in Services obligations. The WTO's Appellate Body Report found America undertook a commitment to provide open and nondiscriminatory market access for recreational services, \\"including online gambling services.\\" The review claims that law enforcement officials tried to intimidate Ayre years before the indictments against him were filed, and that prosecutors \\"…covertly reached out to Ayre through respective third parties … including Ayre’s known business associates and industry contacts, to ‘encourage’ Ayre to make a US$350 million payment to the US Treasury.\\" The government of Antigua and Barbuda welcomed Ayre’s vindication as part of the failure of the US to comply with World Trade Organization ruling on Internet Gaming. The twin islands government said in a statement, \\"In light of the WTO ruling in Antigua and Barbuda’s favour, prosecutions by the United States of licensed gaming entities and their principals in Antigua and Barbuda, such as Calvin Ayre, are completely contrary to binding international agreements. In this context, Calvin Ayre and all other Antigua and Barbuda licensed gaming operators, who were indicted in the United States on Internet Gaming charges, are victims not culprits.\\" Bitcoin involvement In June 2016, Andrew O'Hagan published a writer's account of the background behind Craig Wright publicly asserting himself to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which made the news in May 2016. He revealed Ayre to be part of the business operation behind this affair, possibly even its ultimate organizer and the financial backer of the $30 million acquisition and development of Craig Wright's assets. In August 2017, Ayre acquired cryptocurrency news site Coingeek.com. In September 2017, Ayre was a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporter. In July 2018, Ayre's crypto mining operations Coingeek became the world's largest Bitcoin Cash miner surpassing BTC.top. In November 2018, Ayre threw his support behind the new Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) cryptocurrency, based on his belief that BSV is “a currency, not an asset just to be held, and has real utility.” Ayre predicted that the original Bitcoin (BTC), which he refers to as “the Segwit coin that’s erroneously still called ‘bitcoin,’” would “go to zero value as it has no utility, it does not do anything and [its supporters] intentionally are anti-scaling.” Philanthropy Ayre and Bodog have supported charitable causes including the LA Lakers Youth Foundation and actress Shannon Elizabeth’s Animal Avengers organization. In 2005, Ayre formalized his charitable efforts under the banner of the Calvin Ayre Foundation. The foundation chose to focus on areas including animal welfare, the environment and education for the disadvantaged. The foundation has supported needy families, elementary schools and physical rehabilitation centers in Costa Rica, worked with groups to combat bear bile farming in Asia, and provided funding to enable individuals to pursue higher education. In 2010, the foundation matched funds raised by the online gambling industry for relief efforts tied to the devastating earthquake in Haiti. In 2006, Ayre produced Bodog Salutes The Troops, a weekend of entertainment for US military personnel in Hawaii, footage of which appeared in a one-hour special on Spike TV. The event, which consisted of a poker tournament and a live musical concert featuring Snoop Dogg, was intended as a benefit for the Fisher House Foundation. Following the extensive damage Typhoon Haiyan inflicted on the Philippines in November 2013, Ayre donated $200,000 to local relief efforts. The Calvin Ayre Foundation also pledged to match gaming industry members' individual donations to typhoon relief up to $1 million. In 2016, Ayre’s foundation was operating in Antigua, where Ayre is based, and the Philippines, providing relief and rehabilitation assistance to a school and communities devastated by typhoons in Northern Samar located in central Philippines, and donating $200,000 to a fund dedicated to ensuring deserving Antiguan students get access to premier education. In July 2018, during the \\"Wings of Charity\\" ceremony held in London by the Halo Foundation, Antigua and Barbuda's Governor General Sir Rodney Williams presented Ayre with the foundation's special award for his philanthropic efforts in support of the vulnerable and underprivileged in Antigua and Barbuda. On November 14, 2019, Antigua and Barbuda Governor General His Excellency Sir Rodney Williams presented Ayre with the Faithful and Meritorious Service Cross award in recognition of Ayre’s philanthropic efforts and contributions to the country’s national development.

Biography  Hans Helmut Kornhuber was born as the second of three children of Dr. med. Gertrud and Dr. Arnold Kornhuber. He grew up at a small place Methgen near Königsberg. Eight years old he was admitted to the Friedrich Kollegium in Königsberg. Schooltime ended with preliminary maturity in summer 1944. He was interested in chemistry and got into contact with the chemical institute of the University of Königsberg. With the capitulation of Königsberg on April 9 Kornhuber became a soviet prisoner of war for four and a half years. In September 1949 he was discharged and joined his family in Schleswig-Holstein. In October 1949 he passed a second examination for maturity and started to Munich to study chemistry. In spring 1950 he changed from chemistry to medicine because the experience of captivity led him to think what's important in life. From 1949 on Kornhuber studied medicine at the universities of Munich, Göttingen, Freiburg, Basle and Heidelberg. In 1955 he was promoted to doctor of medicine in Heidelberg.Über Auslösung zyklothymer Depressionen durch seelische Erschütterungen. Heidelberg 1955. In 1955 he married Ursula Heesch, they had five children. He absolved his clinical education at the Neurological University Hospital at the University of Freiburg, where he was habilitated in 1963.Optisch-vestibuläre und somatisch vestibuläre Integration an Neuronen der Großhirnrinde: Ein Beitrag zur multimodalen Koordination der Sinnesafferenzen. Freiburg i. Br. 1963. He spent one and a half research years at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. In 1967 he was appointed the chair of Neurology at the newly founded University of Ulm and there built the Neurological Hospital of the University of Ulm (until 1984 situated in Dietenbronn). In 1996 Kornhuber has been professor emeritus. One of his sons is the Psychiatrist and Psychotherapeut Johannes Kornhuber. Kornhuber saw the achievement of a scientific break through in 1965 with the discovery of the Bereitschaftspotential (or readiness potential), together with his doctoral student Lüder Deecke.Marjan Jahanshahi and Mark Hallett (Eds.): The Bereitschaftspotential: movement-related cortical potentials. Kluwer, New York 2003  Scientific contribution  In 1965 Kornhuber (together with Lüder Deecke) discovered the Bereitschaftspotential, a brain potential in the EEG which precedes all our willed movements and actions.H.

He worked on the sensory systems/perception, conducting many experiments at Baltimore with Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle and his team on skin receptors, and also measuring the channel capacity of sensory systems (and consciousness). He conducted his own research into new therapies with particular emphasis on multiple sclerosis, stroke, dementia, movement disorders, etc. He also made contributions for psychiatry, e.g. the glutamate theory. He contributed to Otorhinolaryngology (hand book articles such as Physiology and Clinic of the Vestibular System). Kornhuber also discovered the eye muscle field in the cerebellum.Lüder Deecke.

Personal life  Blay was born in Parramatta, NSW, Australia and lived in the inner city of Sydney until 1970 when he moved to a spotted gum forest at Bermagui, on the far south coast of NSW, a move detailed in his memoir, Part of the Scenery. In following years his immersion in the wild forests and understanding of their wildlife led to him receiving the inaugural Parks Writer Award to spend 12 months alone in wilderness areas of the region. This has period extended over the years along with his understanding of the south-eastern region. He is also interested in using native plants in sustainable gardening, as in The Australian Native Plant Gardener's Almanac. Since 2001, he has researched the Bundian Way, an ancient Aboriginal pathway, in association with local Aboriginal communities and as the Bundian Way Project Officer for Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council.

Lagos State University is located there. Ojo is located on the eastern section of the Trans–West African Coastal Highway, about 37km west of Lagos. It is part of the Lagos Metropolitan Area. Location of Ojo in Lagos Metropolitan Area Ojo is a primarily residential township although it contains some major markets including Alaba International Market, Alaba livestock market (Alaba Rago), the old Lagos International Trade Fair complex, and Iyana-Iba market. It also houses the divisional headquarters of 81 division Nigerian Army and Navy Town. History Oral tradition holds that Ojo was founded by Esugbemi, his wife Erelu and chief priest Osu who migrated from Ile-Ife to form a settlement named Ilufe. Esugbemi was a hunter who explored the swamp forests in the area which later became Ojo. During his expeditions he became convinced that he ought to expand the settlement. Osu consulted the Oracle which affirmed his decision at Ikemo quarters in present day Olojo district. The new town invited other Awori settlers from Iddo and Idumota who built Irewe Osolu, south of Otto-Awori. The western (Otto-Awori) and northern (Iba and Igbelerin) parts of Ojo developed independently as a result of the settlement of Awori migrants from Ile-Ife. The migrants first settled in Obadore in Iba before expanding towards the west and southwest. Otto-Awori was ruled by a baale until a King was first nominated. This was opposed by the oracle. This led to the formation of Otto-Awori-Iddo. Eventually, an Oba of ascended the throne in the late 18th century to rule alongside the Olojo of Ojo.  Transportation  Transportation is mainly by road. The Trans–West African Coastal Highway runs East-West through the town and divides it into North and South halves. Olojo drive, Old Ojo road, Kemberi road and Alaba road are the main roads in the southern half of the town. In the northern half Chief Esan way, Iyana- Ipaja road, Igbo-elerin road are major roads. Ferry services and speed boats are available through Badagry creek and Ojo river with the main jetty located at Ojo district off Olojo drive. A rail line from Lagos to Badagry through Ojo is under construction and it is expected to alleviate the perpetual traffic jams within the area.  Culture  Ojo is known for the Olojo festival during which the Olojo wears the crown. Oro festivals are held at the death of the Olojo or a Baale. Oro has drawn controversy for elements of the festival which some consider to be misogynistic. Other festivals include Egungun, Obaluwaye, Sango, Ogun, Ota and Osun which are named after deities or heroes which they celebrate. Iyemoja and Gelede and Alaalu are also celebrated in Otto-Awori district.

The EndoMarch movement was founded and sponsored by Drs. Camran, Ceana, Farr, and Azadeh Nezhat, and Barbara Page, and is registered as a 501(c)(3) public charity nonprofit, with headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Attendance The first Worldwide EndoMarch took place on March 13, 2014, and occurred in approximately 43 countries, with a flagship event held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Multiple medical societies and medical schools co-sponsored the event, including the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Society of Reproductive Medicine, Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, The National Infertility Association, Howard University, and the World Symposium on Endometriosis and Oncofertility. Several U.S. public figures attended the first Washington, D.C. EndoMarch, including Oracle Co-CEO Safra Catz, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, Law and Order SVU Actress Stephanie March, MSNBC News reporter Mika Brzezinski, and TV Political Analyst Michelle Bernard. Public figures from other countries have also supported the international marches. The Second Annual Worldwide EndoMarch took place on March 28, 2015, and occurred in dozens of cities around the world, with fairly large turnouts in about 17 countries, and included demonstrations in several cities in the U.S., including Palo Alto and San Diego in California, Dover, Delaware, Hilo, Hawaii, New York, New York, Houston, Texas, and again in Washington, D.C. Organizers As a mostly volunteer-run movement, endometriosis patients and patient advocates have been the main organizers and participants advocating for more awareness, as endometriosis is still so poorly understood that patients are routinely denied adequate medical care because their expressions of chronic pain are mistaken as signs of drug seeking, malingering, or mental illness.

Women pilots were also called \\"aviatrices\\". Women have been flying powered aircraft since 1908; prior to 1970, however, most were restricted to working privately or in support roles in the aviation industry. Aviation also allowed women to \\"travel alone on unprecedented journeys.\\" Women who have been successful in various aviation fields have served as mentors to younger women, helping them along in their careers. Within the first two decades of powered flight, women on every continent except Antarctica had begun to fly, perform in aerial shows, parachute, and even transport passengers. During World War II, women from every continent helped with war efforts and though mostly restricted from military flight many of the female pilots flew in auxiliary services. In the 1950s and 1960s, women were primarily restricted to serving in support fields such as flight simulation training, air traffic control, and as flight attendants. Since the 1970s, women have been allowed to participate in military service in most countries. Women's participation in the field of aviation has increased over the years. In the United States, in 1930, there were around 200 women pilots but in five years there were more than 700. Women of Aviation Worldwide Week has reported that after 1980, the increase in gender parity for women pilots in the United States has been stagnant. Women flying commercial airlines in India make up 11.6% of all pilots. The global number of women airline pilots is 3%.  History  Aida de Acosta, 1903 flying Alberto Santos-Dumont's airship N° 9 The first woman known to fly was Élisabeth Thible, who was a passenger in an untethered hot air balloon, which flew above Lyon, France in 1784. Four years later, Jeanne Labrosse became the first woman to fly solo in a balloon and would become the first woman to parachute, as well. Sophie Blanchard took her first balloon flight in 1804, was performing as a professional aeronaut by 1810 and was made Napoleon's chief of air service in 1811. Blanchard, the first woman who was a professional in the air, died in a spectacular crash in 1819. In June 1903, Aida de Acosta, an American woman vacationing in Paris, convinced Alberto Santos-Dumont, pioneer of dirigibles, to allow her to pilot his airship, becoming probably the first woman to pilot a motorized aircraft. The first machine-powered flight was accomplished by the Wright Brothers on December 17, 1903. Both brothers felt that it was important to recognize the contributions of Katherine Wright to their work. She found teachers who could help with the Wright's flying experiments. Katherine, although not flying with her brothers until later, in 1909, knew \\"everything about the working of their machines.\\" Katherine supported them financially, giving them her savings and also supported them emotionally. When Orville Wright was injured in 1908, Katherine moved close to the hospital to take care of him. Later, after the Wright brothers patented their aircraft in 1906, she worked as their executive secretary. In 1909, she traveled to Europe to become the social manager for her brothers. Her brothers were very introverted and relied on Katherine to help promote their work. Katherine was considered the \\"silent partner\\" of the Wright Brothers by The World Magazine. The Saint Louis Post-Dispatch called her the \\"inspiration of her brothers in their experiments.\\" Wilbur and alt=Wilbur and Katharine Wright seated in the Wright Model A Flyer with Orville Wright standing nearby. This was Katharine's first time flying. Her skirt is tied with a string. Starting 1906, another inventor of aircraft, Emma Lilian Todd began designing her own airplanes. Todd first started studying dirigibles before she moved onto designing airplanes. Todd's first plane flew in 1910 and was piloted by Didier Masson. A woman who was an early parachutist, Georgia \\"Tiny\\" Broadwick started working with barnstormer, Charles Broadwick at age 15 in 1908. She made her first jump in 1908, and in 1913, became the first woman to jump from an aircraft. Broadwick, in 1914, was also the person who gave the first demonstrations of parachute jumping to the United States government. When she retired in 1922, she had completed 1,100 jumps. The first woman passenger in an airplane was Mlle P. Van Pottelsberghe de la Poterie who flew with Henri Farman on several short flights at an airshow in Ghent, Belgium between May and June 1908. Soon after, in July, 1908, sculptor Thérèse Peltier was taken up as a passenger by Léon Delagrange and within a few months had been reported as making a solo flight in Turin, Italy, flying around 200 meters in a straight line about two and a half meters off the ground. Edith Berg, an American, who flew as a passenger with Wilbur Wright in Paris in October 1908, was the inspiration of the hobble skirt designed by Paul Poiret. 1910s alt=Hélène Dutrieu, 1911 Early pioneers include French Raymonde de Laroche, the world's first licensed female pilot on March 8, 1910. Seven other French women followed her, earning pilot's licenses within the next year. One of these, Marie Marvingt, 3rd Frenchwoman licensed for airplanes, but first French woman balloonist licensed in 1901, became the first woman to fly in combat completing bombing raids over Germany. Marvingt tried to get the government to outfit air ambulances prior to the war and became the world first certified Flight Nurse. Hélène Dutrieu became the first woman pilot in Belgium, obtaining the 27th license issued in her country in 1910 and the second female licensed in Europe. Later that same year, she became the first woman to fly with a passenger. In 1910, even before she earned her pilot's license, Lilian Bland a British woman living in Northern Ireland, designed and flew a glider in Belfast. Blanche Scott always claimed to be the first American woman to fly an airplane, but as she was seated when a gust of wind took her up on her brief flight in September 1910, the \\"accidental\\" flight went unrecognized. Within two years, she had established herself as a daredevil pilot and was known as the \\"Tomboy of the Air\\", competing in air shows and exhibitions, as well as flying circuses. On October 13, 1910, Bessica Raiche received a gold medal from the Aeronautical Society of New York, recognizing her as the first American woman to make a solo flight. Harriet Quimby became the USA's first licensed female pilot on August 1, 1911 and the first woman to cross the English Channel by airplane the following year. Thirteen days after Quimby, her friend Matilde E. Moisant an American of French Canadian descent was licensed and began flying in air shows. alt=Georgia \\"Tiny\\" Broadwick, early parachutist, 1913 Within a fortnight, had obtained the first female Russian license and by 1914 she performed the first aerobatic loop made by a woman. Hilda Hewlett became the first British woman to earn a pilot's license on August 29, 1911 and taught her son to fly that same year. In September 1910, Melli Beese became Germany's first woman pilot and the following year began designing her first airplane which was produced in 1913. On October 10, 1911, Božena Laglerová a Czech native of Prague, obtained the first Austrian license for a woman and nine days later secured the second German license for a woman. On 7 December 1910 Jane Herveu, who had previously been involved in automobile racing was licensed in France and began participating in the Femina Cup. Lilly Steinschneider became the first female pilot in the Austro-Hungarian Empire on August 15, 1912. Rosina Ferrario, first female pilot of Italy, earned her license on January 3, 1913 and was as unsuccessful as Marvingt had been to get her government or the Red Cross to allow women to transport wounded soldiers during World War I. Elena Caragiani-Stoenescu, Romania's first woman pilot got the same response from her government about flying for the war effort and turned to journalism. On December 1, 1913, Lyubov Golanchikova signed a contract to become the first female test pilot. She agreed to test \\"Farman-22\\" aircraft manufactured in the Chervonskaya airplane workshop of The first woman on the African Continent to earn a pilot's license was Ann Maria Bocciarelli of Kimberley, South Africa. In 1916, Zhang Xiahun () became China's first female pilot when she attended an airshow of the Nanyuan Aviation School and insisted that she be allowed to fly. After circling the field, tossing flowers, she crashed, becoming a national heroine when she survived. Katherine Stinson became the first woman air mail pilot, when the United States Postal Service contracted her to fly mail from Chicago to New York City in 1918. The following year, Ruth Law flew the first official U.S. air mail to the Philippines. Women were also involved in teaching others how to fly. Hilda Hewlett and Gustave Blondeau teamed up in 1910 to start the first flying school in England, The Hewlett-Blondeau School. The school had only one plane with which to instruct students and was open for two years. Charlotte Möhring, the second German woman to earn a pilot's license, worked as a manager of a flying school in 1913. 1920s Miss Prim with airplane at the flight school Aero Material in left Both men and women after World War I were able to purchase \\"surplus and decommissioned planes.\\" Wanting to fly, but with little demand after the war, pilots purchased the planes and went from town to town offering rides. Creating attractions to bring in crowds, these daredevils performed stunts, loops and began wing walking to attract more customers. The aerialists and pilots formed flying circuses sending promoters ahead of them to hang posters promoting their dangerous feats. In 1920, Phoebe Fairgrave, later Omlie, at the age of eighteen determined to make her aviation career as a stuntwoman. By 1921, she had set a world women's parachute drop record of 15,200 feet and worked as a wing walker for the Fox Moving Picture Company's The Perils of Pauline series. By 1927, Omlie earned the first transport pilots license and airplane mechanics license issued to a woman. Another stuntwoman, Ethel Dare had perfected walking from one plane to another by 1920, the first woman to perform the feat. Bessie Coleman was the first African American woman to become a licensed airplane pilot in 1921. That same year, Annie Langstaff, first law graduate of McGill University began taking flying lessons and in 1922 was proclaimed in an article in Maclean's Magazine, as Canada's first woman to fly. That year, Japan's first woman pilot Tadashi Hyōdō earned her license. Kwon Ki-ok of Korea became the first female licensee of that country in 1925 and after World War II, became instrumental in helping establish the Republic of Korea Air Force. German Marga von Etzdorf was the first woman to fly for an airline when she began co-piloting for Lufthansa in 1927 and piloting solo on commercial Junkers F13 on 1 February 1928.Aboukaia-Driancourt aboard the monoplane \\"Demoiselle Santos-Damout\\", circa 1920. In the late 1920s, women continued to compete in air races and contests related to flying. In 1929, Pancho Barnes moved to Hollywood to work as the first woman stunt pilot. Besides working on such films as Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels (1930), she also founded the Associated Motion Pictures Pilots Union in 1931. The first Women's Air Derby or Powder Puff Derby, an official women-only race from Santa Monica, California to Cleveland, Ohio, was held as part of the 1929 National Air Races and was won by Louise Thaden. Marie Marvingt of France, who had first proposed the idea of using airplanes as ambulances in 1912 continued to promote her idea successfully in the 1920s. During the French colonial wars, Marvingt evacuated injured military personnel with Aviation Sanitaire, a flying ambulance service. Canadian Elsie MacGill became the first woman to earn a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1929. On November 2, 1929, at Curtiss Field in Valley Stream, New York, 26 women pilots gathered and formed an international organization to provide mutual support for advancing women pilots and named themselves The Ninety-Nines, after the number or charter members. 1930s left The 1929 stock market crash and ensuing depression, coupled with more stringent safety regulations, caused many of the flying circuses and barnstorming circuits to fold. During the decade, options for women pilots in the United States were limited mainly to sales, marketing, racing and barnstorming and being an instructor pilot. In 1930, Ellen Church, a pilot and nurse, who was unable to secure work flying proposed to airline executives that women be allowed to act as hostesses on planes. She was hired on a three-month trial basis by Boeing Air Transport and selected the first seven flight attendants for airlines, requiring them to be under 115 pounds, nurses and unmarried. In 1930, Amy Johnson an English aviator, made the first England to Australia flight by a woman. Antonie Strassmann, a German emigre to the US, became the first woman to successfully cross the Atlantic aboard an aircraft, traveling in May 1932 with a team on a Dornier Do X flying boat. In the fall of 1932, Strassmann piloted a Zeppelin from Germany to Pernambuco in Brazil. American Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic (1932). Earhart became a public favorite among aviators of the time. Earhart also urged the public to encourage and enable young women to become airplane pilots themselves. In 1936 and 1937, she taught students at Purdue University, which was \\"one of the few U.S. colleges to offer aviation classes to women\\". alt=Women pilots who escorted the landing of Amy Johnson in Sydney on 4 June 1930, at the end of the first England to Australia flight by a woman. Photo presented to the National Library of Australia by Miss Meg Skelton (on left). Hazel Ying Lee, a dual American-Chinese citizen, earned her pilot's license in 1932 in the United States. She went to China to volunteer to serve in the Chinese Army after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, but was rejected due to her sex. She flew commercial aircraft in Canton until returning to the United States in 1937. Joining the WASPS, in 1943, she delivered planes for the military until she was killed in service in 1944. In 1933 Lotfia ElNadi became the first Egyptian woman and first Arab woman to earn a pilot's license. That same year, Marina Raskova became the first Russian woman navigator for the Soviet Air Forces. The following year she began teaching as the first female instructor at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy and then in 1935 received her certification as a flight instruments trainer. Sabiha Gökçen, world's first female combat pilot. In 1934, Chinese actress Lee Ya-Ching obtained a pilot's license in Switzerland; the following year, she obtained the first license for a woman from the American Boeing School of Aeronautics; and, in 1936, she became the first woman licensed by China as a pilot. She went on to found a civilian flying school in Shanghai that same year. Sarla Thakral was first Indian woman to fly, earning her aviation pilot license in 1936 in a Gypsy Moth solo. She later completed over 1000 hours of flight time. In 1935, Nancy Bird Walton obtained the first Australian license allowing a woman to carry passengers so that she could fly an ambulance service for the Royal Far West Children's Health Scheme. She later founded the Australian Women Pilots' Association. That same year, Phyllis Doreen Hooper earned the first women pilot's license in South Africa. The following year, she became the first female licensed as a commercial pilot and within 2 years had become the first South African woman flight instructor. In France, Suzanne Melk, was the first known women in her country to fly and the first women in Europe to receive a pilot's license in 1935. In 1936, Hanna Reitsch of Germany became one of the first persons to fly a fully controllable helicopter and within two years, she earned the first woman helicopter pilot's license. In the prestigious Bendix Race in 1936, women not only took first place, but also second and fifth. The following year, Sabiha Gökçen of Turkey became the first trained woman combat pilot, participating in search operations and bombing flights during the Dersim Rebellion. While Gökçen was not the first to have participated in military operations, she was the first woman to have been trained as a military pilot, graduating from the Aircraft School (Tayyare Mektebi) in Eskişehir. In 1939, the South African Women's Aviation Association (SAWAA) was formed with 110 women members. Colloquially known as the Women's Civil Air Guard, within the year, membership had swelled to between 3000 and 4000 members. With the outbreak of war, the organization changed focus to become the Women's Auxiliary of the South African Air Force. 1940s Stamp of Russia 2012 No 1567 Marina Raskova who flew in WWII. As World War II began, women became involved in combat. In the United States, prior to the war, pilots typically flew only in good weather, so that they could judge ground position. Flying in combat required pilots to fly in varying conditions, and a push for instrument training began. By 1944 around 6,000 women had been trained as Link Trainer operators and were teaching male pilots how to read instruments. WAVES like Patricia W. Malone transitioned after the war to commercial flight simulation instruction, where women dominated the industry of flight training operators. In 1939, Jacqueline Cochran wrote to the first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, about using women pilots in the military. Later, Nancy Harkness Love also made a similar request to the US Army, however both women's ideas were put on hold until 1942. Love was then put in command of the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron [WAFS], which developed a reputation for quiet efficiency and became a well-respected unit. General Henry Arnold on September 14, 1942, put Cochran in charge of a new program called the Army Air Forces Women's Flying Training Detachment (WFTD). By August 5, 1943, the WFTD was merged with the WAFS to form the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). The WASPs supported the military in various ways, flying new planes from factories to Army Air Force bases, worked as test pilots, worked as flying chauffeurs and helped tow targets for antiaircraft gunnery practice. The WASPS never gained full military benefits, the organization was disbanded in December 1944. WASPS finally earned veteran status retroactively in 1979. Besides working as women pilots, American women also started working as air traffic controllers during WWII. Commander Frances Biadosz was the only WAVE to wear wings for air-navigation during World War II. Women in the United States were also hired by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to work as scientists and engineers, as well as analysts, reviewing data from windtunnels on airplane prototypes. In 1940, Major Phyllis Dunning (née Phyllis Doreen Hooper) became the first South African woman to enter full-time military service as the Commander of the South African Women's Auxiliary Air Force (SAWAAF). In 1941, the Southern Rhodesia Women's Auxiliary Air Service was commissioned. Within a few months over 100 women recruits were providing clerical services, sewing skills, parachute packing, and serving as drivers, equipment assistants and mechanics. Another South African, Rosamund Steenkamp became the first woman in the world to fly a jet, when she flew a Gloster Meteor III in August 1945, when jet- engines were still a revolutionary technology, for the Ministry of Aircraft Production's Air Transport Auxiliary. Margot Duhalde, the first woman pilot of the French Air Force. The Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), a British civilian operation during World War II, had scores of female pilots, under the command of Pauline Gower. Margot Duhalde, a Chilean woman, flew transport missions for the ATA during World War II and after the war became the first woman pilot of the French Air Force, flying transports to Morocco. For her services, Duhalde was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1946. Valérie André, a neurosurgeon and member of the French army, became the first woman to fly a helicopter in combat, while serving in Indochina (1945). The Royal Canadian Air Force created a Women's Division in 1942, offering women 2/3 the pay of their male counterparts. Though barred from combat and flying, women performed aircraft maintenance and served in air traffic control, in addition to other duties. By the end of the war, over 17,000 Canadian women had served in the Women's Division either at home or abroad. Korean , who had earned her pilot's license in 1927, joined the Republic of Korea Air Force in 1948 and was appointed first lieutenant. She was the founding commander of the Women's Air Force Corps in 1949, but was captured and taken to North Korea when the Korean War broke out. Female mechanics work on left Unlike other countries fighting in WWII, the Soviet Union created an all-woman combat flight unit, the 588th Night-Bomber Air-Regiment or the Night Witches. This group of the Soviet Air Forces, flew harassment bombing and precision bombing missions from 1942 to the end of the World War II. The organization was first formed by Joseph Stalin on October 8, 1941 and all of the women were volunteers. The Night Witches flew 30,000 missions and \\"dumped 23,000 tons of bombs on the German invaders\\": the unit was granted both 'Guards' status and a battle-honour: 'Taman-sky' (for their work during the Battle of Taman), and was therefore re- numbered to finish the war as the 46th 'Tamansky' Guards Night-Bomber Air- Regiment. The Soviets also had the only women to be considered flying aces. Lydia Litvyak was credited with different numbers of kills from various sources, but in 1990, the tally was given as 12 solo kills and 3 shared kills. Yekaterina Budanova fought combat missions over Saratov and Stalingrad and was credited with 11 kills. In 1948 Ada Rogato, Brazil's first licensed woman pilot, became the first female agricultural pilot when she was hired by the government to crop dust coffee fields and eliminate the borer beetle that was plaguing the crop. The following year, Rogato became the first woman to fly solo over the Andes and in 1951, flew from Tierra del Fuego to Alaska, a solo flight which would take her across South America, Central America and North America. In 1948, Isabella Ribeiro de Cabral, who became Isabella de Freitas the following year, became the first woman pilot of Trinidad and Tobago. It would be another forty years, in 1988, before the first Trinidadian woman, Wendy Yawching became a captain. 1950s The Korean War offered new opportunities in critical roles for Women Marines, like these control tower air traffic controllers. In 1951, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) of China enrolled 55 women trainees. When they graduated, the following year, the women represented 6 communication operators, 5 navigators, 30 on-board aircraft mechanics and 14 pilots. A second class of 160 trainees entered PLAAF in 1956, but only 44 of them completed their training. In 1952, Earsley Barnett, American wife of Major Carl Barnett, founder of Wings Jamaica, earned the first pilot license granted to a woman in Jamaica. She later became the first Jamaican flight instructor, as well as a commercial pilot. Jacqueline Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier in 1953. By June 1953, she was the holder of \\"all but one of the principal world airplane speed records for straightaway and closed-course flight\\" for women. During the Korean War, former WASPs were asked to join active duty in the Air Force. Thirteen percent of the WAVES recruits by 1952 were air selected for air training, which included positions as air control personnel, aerographer's mates, electronics technicians and as other support personnel. In 1953, the WAVES lifted a ban on women serving as mechanics. was the only South Korean woman to serve as a pilot in the ROK Air Force during the Korean War. left Organizations were formed, such as the Australia Women's Pilot's Association (AWPA). Another organization was the Whirly-Girls, started by Jean Ross Howard Phelan in 1955 for women helicopter pilots. She started the group as an informal interest group, but formalized it in order to better help the members network and support each other in the male-dominated field. Pakistan modeled its air force on the British Royal Air Force during the late 1950s. This allowed for more women to become involved in the military in Pakistan. In 1958 Dorothy Rungeling of Canada became her country's first woman to solo pilot a helicopter. In the 1950s and 1960s, air travel was expensive and few people of color could afford to fly. U.S. segregation laws were slowly being overturned to lift barriers for not only travel, but for employment opportunities. Coupled with the influx of workers from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean, and the independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, British need for labor in the post-war period made recruiting of 'coloured labour' in the same period a necessity. The following decades would increasingly see more women from former colonies enter aviation. 1960s Stewardesses from 1968 working for United Airlines.alt=Stewardesses from 1968 working for United Airlines. In the 1960s, stewardesses, as female flight attendants were known, were considered glamorous and exotic adventurers. Frank Sinatra's song Come Fly with Me gave birth to the jet set. Adding to the allure, Bernard Glemser's novel, Girl on a Wing, and the British movie based on it, Come Fly with Me (1963), depicted stewardesses as stylish seekers of romance. Wearing custom-fitted uniforms, attendants were career women, whose looks, marital status and childlessness were guarded by industry executives, much as Hollywood starlets had been. On the one hand, they were to project an ideal of womanhood, but on the other, they were used to sell airline travel through their sexuality. The double standard that they faced as well as the glamorous lifestyle they lived, shot to the best-seller's list with the publication in 1967 of the book, Coffee, Tea or Me? In 1963, stewardesses who held a press conference on airlines' policy of retiring stewardesses at 32, caught the attention of the country. The press conference focused attention on the airlines narrow standard of \\"feminine allure\\". In 1960, Olga Tarling became the first woman air traffic controller in Australia and Yvonne Pope Sintes and Frankie O'Kane become the first female British air traffic controllers. That same year, Alia Menchari became the first woman Tunisian pilot. In 1961, Lucille Golas attained the first pilot license for a woman in Guyana to assist her husband in his mining business. Asegedech Assefa became the first Ethiopian woman to earn a pilot's license in 1962. That same year, Jacqueline Cochran became the first woman to fly a jet across the Atlantic Ocean. She was also the first woman to break the sound barrier. Throughout the decade, she and Jaqueline Aurial of France traded women's speed and distance records what would be known as the \\"battle of the Jackies.\\" Valentina Tereshkova on Russian stamp. A privately funded project, of William Lovelace, the Woman in Space Program recruited women pilots in the U.S. to test them for suitability for the space program. Thirteen of the recruits passed NASA's physical requirements. Scheduled for additional testing, the United States Navy canceled use of their facilities as there were no NASA officials involved. Public hearings were held by a special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics in 1962. Because NASA required all astronauts to attain an engineering degree and be graduates of military jet piloting test programs, none of the women could meet the entry prerequisites. The subcommittee took no action after the hearing. The following year, Valentina Tereshkova, an amateur Russian parachute jumper became the first woman in space. In 1963, Betty Miller became the first woman to fly solo across the Pacific Ocean and Anne Spoerry, a French doctor living in Kenya became the first female member of the African Medical and Research Foundation's \\"Flying Doctors\\", operating her plane through the bush to provide needed medical assistance in remote areas. In 1964, women again made history when Geraldine Mock became the first woman to circumnavigate the globe. Because of the unpopularity of the Vietnam War in the United States, men were not volunteering at high enough rates; however, many women were being turned away because of limits on women's work in the military. In 1967, a law was passed allowing more women into the military and to be promoted to high ranks. In 1969, Kucki von Gerlach obtained the first pilot's license issued to a woman in South West Africa, now Namibia. That same year, Turi Widerøe of Norway became the first female pilot for Scandinavian Airlines. Turi Widerøe had for years been a pilot for her father's company Widerøe, which today is the largest regional airline in the Scandinavian countries. Turi Widerøe is still today recognized as the western world's first woman commercial pilot for a major airlines after she joined Scandinavian Airlines in 1967. 1970s USAF Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training Class 77-08 Until the 1970s, aviation had been a traditionally male occupation in the United States. Commerce Department regulations virtually required pilots to have flown in the military to acquire sufficient flight hours, and until the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force and Navy barred women from flying and they were routinely denied work in commercial piloting. The military did not open fighter jet flights to women until 1993. Women eventually began to enter U.S. major commercial aviation in the 1970s and 1980s, with 1973 seeing the first female pilot at a major U.S. airline, American Airlines. American also promoted the first female captain of a major U.S. airline in 1986 and the following year had the first all-woman flight crew. In other countries, women were starting to fly as pilots, such as Turi Widerøe, who was hired in late 1968, for Scandinavian Airlines System and Aeroflot had already hired women pilots. In the 1970s, women were again, for the first time since WWII, permitted to fly in the United States Armed Forces, beginning with the Navy and the Army in 1974, and then the Air Force in 1976. By the mid-1970s, women were predicting that there would be a large increase in female pilots because of the women's liberation movement. Louise Sacchi was the first international woman ferry pilot who flew planes across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans over 340 times, more than any other non-airline pilot. In 1971 she set a women's speed record by flying a single-engine land plane from New York to London in 17 hours and 10 minutes, a record that still stands today. Sacchi was the first woman to win the Godfrey L. Cabot Award for distinguished service to aviation. The first graduating class of ten female Air Force officers earned their Silver Wings on September 2, 1977. These ten women were part of Class 77-08 and graduated at Williams Air Force Base. In 1978, a group of former WASPs formed the Women's Military Pilots Association (WMPA). In 1975 Yola Cain became the first Jamaican-born commercial pilot and flight instructor. The following year, Cain became the first female pilot with the Jamaica Defence Force and in the 1980s would become the first woman pilot for TransJamaica Ltd. Four years later, in 1979, Jamaican Maria Ziadie-Haddad became one of the first women in the Western Hemisphere to become a commercial jet airline pilot when she was hired as the first woman pilot of Air Jamaica, as a Boeing 727 second officer. Another Jamaican, Michele Yap, became the first female airline captain in the Caribbean flying the Leeward Islands Air Transport's Twin Otter in 1988. The following year, Captain Yap was the first to pilot an all-female crew in the Anglo-Caribbean. On 9 September 1976 Asli Hassan Abade soloed her first flight as the only female pilot in the Somali Air Force. In 1977 Cheryl Pickering-Moore and Beverley Drake of Guyana became the first two women pilots of the Guyana Defence Force. Drake was transferred a few months later as the first female pilot of the Guyana Airways Corporation, she would go on in the 1990s to become the first woman and African-American senior inspection analyst working for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Jill Brown-Hiltz joined Texas International Airlines as a pilot in 1978, becoming the first African American woman to fly for a commercial airline in the United States. That same year, Chinyere Kalu, at the time Chinyere Onyenucheya became, Nigeria's first female pilot. In 1979, Koh Chai Hong became the first woman pilot in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). Continuing her military career, Koh became one of the first two female Lieutenant-Colonels in 1999. Bahamian Patrice Clarke, later Washington, entered Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach in 1979. Three years later she would become the school's first black woman to graduate with a BS in aeronautical science and her commercial pilot's certification. She would go on to become the first woman pilot hired by Bahamasair and later the first black female to command airplanes in the U.S. for a major carrier service when she was promoted to captain by United Parcel Service (UPS) in 1994. Close of the twentieth century Petty Officer 3rd Class Rosalee Burton, operates a training device designed to simulate in- flight pressure changes on aviators. As a Navy training device trainer, Burton operated, maintained, and taught about Navy training equipment at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute. Circa 1982. At the close of the century, legal efforts to eliminate barriers of race and sexism in the aviation sector resulted in industry modifications in hiring practices. In the United States, in the late 1970s the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which the court monitored over the next decades and decreed in 1995 had been sufficiently addressed. In Africa, lack of a strong national carrier resulted in many tourism routes being overtaken by European airlines, but growth in the sector during the 1980s and 1990s saw that 26% of the market share on intercontinental flights were run by Africans. In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth in the tourism sector through the 1990s, led to dramatic expansion of the civil aviation sector, with many countries seeing airport expansions. In military services, women's roles increased during the period in North America, Europe and Asia. In 1980, Lynn Rippelmeyer of the U.S. became the first woman to fly a Boeing 747 and four years later became the first woman to serve as captain on the craft. That same year, Olive Ann Beech was awarded the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the U.S. National Aeronautic Association, for aircraft manufacturing. In 1981, Mary Crawford became the first women's flight officer in the United States Navy and that same year Yichida Ndlovu would earn the first civilian female pilot's license in Zambia. Unable to join the British Royal Air Force or local cadet forces, Elizabeth Jennings Clark of St. Lucia found a private scholarship program to offset the high-cost of training. She became the first female pilot for LIAT when she finished her training in 1983. That same year, Charlotte Larson and Deanne Schulman made history when Larson became the first woman to captain a smoke jumper aircraft and Schulman became the first woman qualified as a smoke jumper. Khatool Mohammadzai became the first Afghan woman paratrooper in 1984, the same year that Beverly Burns first served as captain on a Boeing 747 for a cross-country trip. In 1986, Rebecca Mpagi joined Uganda's National Resistance Army as its first woman pilot. She would continue to rise in the ranks until by 2008, Mpagi was a Lieutenant Colonel, serving as the head of women affairs for the Uganda People's Defence Force. In 1987, British Airlines hired their first woman pilot, Lynne Barton. and that same year Erma Johnson became the first black and first woman chair of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport's Board of Directors. Sakhile Nyoni , a Zimbabwean woman, became the first woman pilot in Botswana in 1988. The following year the Afghan Air Force admitted Latifa Nabizada and her sister, Laliuma, as the first women to train at the military flight school. The sisters would graduate from helicopter school in 1991 becoming the first women Afghani pilots. Canadians Deanne Brasseur and Jane Foster were the first women to fly military aircraft in Canada in 1989. Ensign Matice Wright first US Navy African American flight officer 1993. Although five women officers had qualified as Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots in the 1950s, the RAF did not allow women to pursue a career in flying until Julie Ann Gibson and Sally Cox become the RAF's first career pilots in 1990. On July 31 of 1991, the United States Senate lifted the ban on military women flying in combat. By 1998, US military women were flying combat missions from aircraft carriers. In 1992, the first female helicopter pilot to fly in Antarctica was a military officer, Judy Chesser Coffman, of the United States Navy. That same year, Lt. Kelly J. Franke of the United States Navy was the first woman pilot to be awarded the Naval Helicopter Association Pilot of the Year Award.Bogino 1992 Lt. Franke flew 105 support missions with HSC-2's Desert Ducks detachment in Bahrain and was cited for extraordinary aviation achievements for 664.2 hours of accident free flight hours.Flying 1992, p. 34. While there were many African American women in the US military, it was 1993 before Matice Wright became the first black woman flight officer in the United States Navy. That same year, Nina Tapula became the first woman military pilot of Zambia. Harita Kaur Deol became the first female solo pilot in the Indian Air Force, in September 1994, flying an Avro HS-748 at the age of 22. Chipo Matimba became the first woman to complete the Air Force of Zimbabwe's pilot training course in 1996. On December 17, 1998 Kendra Williams was credited as the first woman pilot to launch missiles in combat during Operation Desert Fox. In 1999, Caroline Aigle received the French Air Force's fighter pilot wings and was assigned to fly the Mirage 2000-5. In the civilian sector, Veronica Foy became the first woman pilot of Malawi in 1992 and by the close of the decade would become Malawi's first woman captain. The first black female Mawalian pilot, Felistas Magengo- Mkandawire began flying as first officer for Air Malawi in 1995. In 1993, Aurora Carandang became the first woman captain for Philippine Airlines. Asnath Mahapa, the first black South African woman, became a pilot in 1998, the same year that Nicole Chang Leng became the first woman pilot of the Seychelles. In November 1998, M'Lis Ward became the first African American woman to captain for a major U.S. commercial airline, United Airlines. In 1998, Aysha Alhameli of the United Arab Emirates became the first Emirati Female Pilot. More organizations to support women in aviation careers were formed. Women in Aviation International (WAI) formed in 1990 and formalized the organization in 1994. WAI went on to establish the Pioneer Hall of Fame to honor women in aviation who had made special contributions to the field. In 1995, the Federation of European Women Pilots (FEWP) was founded in Rome. and two years later the Association for Women in Aviation Maintenance (AWAM) was formed.  Notable Influential Profiles and Figures in the Aviation Industry  Over the years since the beginning of the twentieth century, there have been many remarkable moments by women in the aviation industry. However, few were pioneers, and their influence and impact were huge, paving the way for more women to be involved in the different aspects of the aviation industry. Harriet Quimby – 1875 to 1912 A celebrated pioneer in the United States, Quimby was adventurous and encouraged more women to join the aviation industry. Through her weekly articles in various magazines, she challenged women, and through her visions of airlines to ferry people and scheduled air routes, she made a huge contribution towards the growth and the development of the aviation industry. She warned those who flew aircraft on the dangers of being overconfident and emphasized on the importance of observing safety while piloting . Taught how to fly by John Moisant, Quimby was the first woman to fly across the English Channel. As a contributing journalist in magazines, she shared her experiences and the lessons she learned while piloting. In one of her articles entitled ‘Aviation as a Feminine Sport’ Quimby noted that there was no reason as to why women would not be as confident as their male counterparts. She added that as long as a person observed maximum care, they would not cause any accidents. Quimby had strong belief in the aviation industry of the United States and encouraged more women to take on the air . Nancy Harkness Love - 1914 to 1976 Born in February 1914, Nancy played an instrumental role in the acceptance of women, both as career and military pilots. At the age of 16 years, with only 15 hours of solo time, Nancy flew a plane from Boston to Poughkeepsie, New York, where the weather changed. She did not know how to read the compass, and with the gauge broken, had to land the plane . She safely landed the plane, an event that would mark her 40-year career in the aviation industry. After earning Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) instrument rating and a seaplane rating in 1940, Nancy, alongside other 32 pilots, were tasked with flying American airplanes to Canada, from where they would be shipped to France. At the age of 28, she was appointed as the Director of the Women’s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, WAFS, an organization of women who tested aircraft, ferried aircraft and trained other pilots on how to fly aircraft. This WAFS organization played a pivotal role in the integration of women pilots to the military. Under her command, women flew every type of military aircraft. In addition, through her firm belief that women could still co-exist with men and take on non-traditional roles, more doors were opened for more women in the aviation industry . Geraldine (Jerrie) Cobb – 1931 to 2019 Born to a commercial pilot in 1931, Jerrie Cobb was the first woman to qualify to go into space. Through the help of her father and football coach, who was a flight instructor and owned a plane, Jerrie learned how to fly, and by the time of her birthday at 17, she got a private pilot’s license. Through her savings, which she made while playing softball at semi- professional level, she bought her aircraft, a war surplus Fairchild PT-23. She would later receive her commercial pilot license at the age of 18, permitting her to fly professionally. Jerrie later joined the Lovelace Foundation, where she passed all 75 Mercury astronaut tests. After further tests, Jerry, among the other 11 astronaut candidates were chosen for Project Mercury. Even though she would later be dropped based on lacking jet piloting experience, her contribution to the aviation industry-inspired many other women to join the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the aviation industry in general.  Current Trends in the Aviation Industry regarding Women  Air Traffic Controller 1st Class Erica Banks explains the SPN 43 Radar System to General Walter Natynczyk, Canadian chief of Defense Staff, in the amphibious air traffic control center aboard the amphibious assault ship Today women's participation in the aviation sector is still low, but growing. As of 2010, just over 7% of certified civilian pilots (both private and commercial) in the United States were women. As of July 2014, approximately 5.12% of certified airline or commercial pilots in the United States are women. Canada has seen an increase to 18% of women in Royal Canadian Air Force jobs. Overall, in 2008, there were only 16% of women working in the manufacturing of aircraft and spacecraft. Women who work as aerospace engineers made up only 25% in the field in 2014. Women make up less than 6% of senior executive level positions in airline companies, as of 2015. Pakistani pilot Ayesha Farooq was the first female fighter pilot for the Pakistan Air Force. At least 19 women became pilots in the air force in the decade from 2003. India has been very successful at recruiting women to pilot commercial airliners. In 2014, women made up 11.6% of pilots. The global average was 3%. Women credit the extended family support systems that exist which help them balance family and career. By 2012, China's PLAAF had trained more than 300 female pilots and over 200 auxiliary air personnel. Large numbers have been trained to fly China's most advanced combat jets, including the J-10. In 2016, Wang Zheng (Julie Wang), now a Silver Airways captain, became the first Asian woman to fly a global circumnavigation and the first Chinese person to pilot an aircraft solo around the world, marking the emergence of women in China's general aviation sector. left In Japan, the first female captain for commercial passenger flights was Ari Fuji, who began flying as captain for JAL Express in July 2010. In terms of tourism-driven growth in the aviation sector, throughout the Asia-Pacific region, there is a shortage of pilots, which is driving gender biases to be pushed aside for women to be hired. Vietnam Airlines, a major carrier in one of fastest-growing aviation markets, has created flight-schedules that allow flexibility to deal with personal demands. EasyJet Plc provides scholarships for women pilots to help offset the high cost of training and EVA Air has actively recruited candidates from university programs. In Africa, many of the trained pilots migrate to the Middle East or Asia where opportunities for career advancement and more sophisticated facilities exist. Women Aviators in Africa was founded in 2008 in an attempt to mentor and inspire young women to train in the aviation industry, as estimates for women in the field fall considerably below 6%. Though there is a high level of need across Africa for rural aviation, there is insufficient infrastructure to support expansion. Grass-roots efforts have seen success with training for bush pilots in transport, medical assistance and policing. Efforts are on-going to increase the numbers of women because women are less likely to move to other areas if they as able to find sufficient employment and opportunities in their own communities. As of 2016, seven of the top ten markets in terms of growth-speed of aviation were in Africa.  Sexism  Women often had to work hard to prove themselves as capable as men in the field. Clare Booth Luce wrote, \\"Because I am a woman, I must make unusual efforts to succeed. If I fail, no one will say, 'She doesn't have what it takes.' They will say, 'Women don't have what it takes.'\\" Pioneer aviator, Claude Grahame-White felt that women were \\"not 'temperamentally suited' to handle the controls of an airplane.\\" During the first National Women's Air Derby in 1929, women flying the race faced \\"threats of sabotage and headlines that read, 'Race Should Be Stopped.'\\" Because flying was considered dangerous, many aircraft manufacturers in the late 1920s hired women as sales representatives and flight demonstrators. \\"The reasoning was that if a woman could fly an airplane, it really could not be that difficult or dangerous.\\" In 1986, a spokesperson for the Airline Pilot's Association said that the reason there were only two women Boeing 747 captains at the time was \\"because women in aviation are a relatively recent phenomenon and everything in the airlines industry is done by seniority\\". In 1934, however, Helen Richey became the first woman to fly a commercial airliner and went on to quit that job in ten months because the all-male pilot's union would not admit her and she rarely got to fly. Biases toward women's traditional roles with men in the cockpit and women serving beverages and blankets have become ingrained, forcing women who want to fly to struggle with the attitudes of both co-workers and society. A survey conducted by Mitchell, Krstivics & Vermeulen in 2005 found that many women pilots were either unaware of sexism directed towards them or had not experienced any sexism directly. However, many women believe that more women are experiencing prejudice than are admitting it.  Diversity in the Classroom  Even though in history, women faced exclusion from education, the end of the Civil War signified a new era where women were then allowed to attend classes side by side with the men. More recently, the rates of women attending classes and going through education systems have improved significantly. In 1970, 42.3 percent of the undergraduate students were women, a figure which has grown up to 56.1 percent in 2007. This improvement is key, as it signifies that women have the access to education and training programs than ever before. Contextually, women can access the needed aviation training just like their male counterparts. Therefore, it eliminates the basis of women being incapable of handling particular job profiles and not being capable of working in certain capacities. Thus, women ought to have the same opportunities as men, given the abundance of skills and expertise.  Wage Inequalities and Career Advancement  Wage inequality between men and women has not only been a talking point in the aviation industry but also in other industries where women are paid significantly less than men. Despite possessing the same skills, expertise, and experience, women are not paid the same in the industry. In addition to the skewed wage structure, the organization culture in the industry has continually favored men regarding career advancement up the ladder. Few women advance their careers in the aviation industry as many top positions are held by men. Women have faced a tough time, climbing from the bottom of the ladder up, while men have seamlessly and without a struggle, spend less time at the lower tiers of the career ladder before assuming top positions.  Solutions to Gender Imbalance   Affirmative Action  Previous studies demonstrate that affirmative action has compelled women to develop their careers as pilots. It has motivated women to take up the challenges and enter the male-dominated occupation. Following the success of this initiative thus far, albeit unsatisfactorily, it is important that it is continuously implemented to make it easy for women to enter in the aviation industry and progress up the career ladder up to the top management positions. A positive attitude and a change of culture in the aviation industry are needed if men will change their perspective regarding the involvement of women in the aviation industry.  Funding Initiatives  Even though the tuition fees for tertiary institutions is not analyzed in this study, receiving the required training and knowledge requires a substantial financial investment. An extensive research found that these tuition and training fees are paid by either parent, the students, or through loans. Given the level of high fees paid during the training, and considering the low incomes paid to women at the start of their careers, it is important that they incentivized in their studies and training. Given the high costs of qualifications, the costly nature of the relevant licenses, and the time consumed, many aviation students end up discontinuing their studies. Therefore, more scholarships to women interested in a career in the aviation industry ought to be availed to ensure that gender equality is achieved in the long term.  Cultural Evolution  Attitudes, stereotypes, and prejudices are embedded in culture and have played a significant role in inequality in the aviation industry. It, therefore, important that men are educated on the impact of these attitudes and prejudices against women. They have to be educated on how their behavior affects pilots and why it is important to evolve the culture in the aviation industry. Having an understanding of the impacts of these attitudes helps in forging great relationships and interactions amongst the diverse flight crews. Women also need to be encouraged to take up these careers to address the underlying problem where women have previously been discouraged from pursuing a professional career in aviation.

History Topnaars began settling in the area of Walvis Bay and along the Kuiseb River during the start of the 19th century. They first occupied the area at the mouth of the Swakop River, today the city of Swakopmund, and moved south beyond Walvis Bay to the Kuiseb mouth between 1820 and 1830. A small faction moved upriver to Sandfontein but was attacked and driven away by warriors of the Red Nation. They receded to Rooibank (Scheppmannsdorf during Imperial Germany's colonial rule of South-West Africa). Missionary Heinrich Schmelen and Captain Amraal Lambert of the Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) visited the Topnaar around 1824 or 1825 while searching for a hospitable place at the coast to improve logistics for the support of the missionaries in the hinterland. Culture and living conditions ǃNara melons which grow on the banks of the Kuiseb are the primary staple food of the Topnaars. Apart from ǃNara products which are also sold to tourists, most Topnaar people depend on livestock farming and old-age grants. Seth Kooitjie is the Chief of the Topnaar people. The traditional authority gains money from tourism concessions and fishing quotas in their tribal area but these monies have yet to bring about upliftment of the community which lives without access to sewerage and electricity.

During the 2016 Olympic games several bouts involving Russian competitors seemed to be judged in favour of the Russian athlete when it was clear to many they had lost. Bantamweight Vladimir Nikitin was given a unanimous decision against Ireland's World champion Michael Conlon in the quarterfinal of the tournament judges all scoring for the Russian in rounds one and three. Afterwards, in an irate television interview, Conlon claimed AIBA (www.aiba.org) were cheats and had been paid to fix fights. In order to reach the quarterfinal bout with Conlon, Nikitin was controversially awarded the win by split decision when he fought Thailand's Chatchai Butdee. According to the Bangkok Post, Butdee was quoted as saying, \\"I should have won the fight. I think I was more on target. I do not really understand the judges' decisions\\". The day after the quarterfinal AIBA denied these allegations however removed several Judges and Referees for the panel for the rest of the games over irregularities in scoring.

This was then followed a year later by first 'official' (as the Christadelphians had not been named as such until then) book, compiled also by Roberts, and was called simply \\"The Christadelphian Hymn Book.\\" It contained 223 psalms/hymns and 50 anthems but no music. In 1869 Roberts produced a version of this book with music included. The first major revision of the official book took place in 1932 under the guidance of Charles Curwen Walker of Birmingham, England, the editor of The Christadelphian magazine. There were 73 new songs added, including some originals. It was further expanded in 1962 by John Carter, also editor of the magazine, and L G Sargent. Its simple monotone front cover with gold writing gave it the nickname \\"The Black Hymn Book.\\" The last major revision, this time by various members of the denomination, was in 2002. Subtitled Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs the cover colour was changed to green, the number of songs increased to 438 and the hymns and anthems were no longer in separate sections. As most Christadelphians own their own hymn books (i.e. they are not communal) many get their names or initials embossed on them. The 2002 version of the book is also available in E-book format from The Christadelphian publishing office. Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the Scottish Psalter and non- Christadelphian hymn-writers including Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and John Newton. Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community. Complimentary (or very rarely alternative) books used by the community have included The Sunday School Union Hymn Book (1897), Suffolk St Christadelphian Hymn Book (1903), Sing to the Lord (1978) and Praise the Lord (1993).

The genus Mymecoris is monotypic with one Palaearctic species. It differs in its outward appearance and way of life from other \\"grass bugs\\" in the Stenodemini, being predatory and an effective ant mimic.Chinery, 2005 Description macropterous individual The bugs are four to six millimeters long. The adult insects resemble ants of the genus Formica, the larvae dark Lasius ant species. They are often found together with ants, to which they have a convincing but superficial resemblance. The long rostrum is held inconspicuously beneath the head. The bugs suck plant juices, but feed mainly on aphids, other small insects and insect eggs, sometimes on honeydew, unlike other \\"grass bugs\\" (Stenodemini) which are exclusively herbivorous. The larvae hatch in May. The adults can be found from early June to early August. There is one generation a year. The overwintering eggs are buried in older blades of grass. Both sexes are usually flightless but some winged individuals occur. The generic name is from Greek myrmex, ant, and koris, beetle or bug. The specific name is the Latin for slender or graceful.  Distribution and habitat  Ant-mimic predatory bug, Myrmecoris gracilis, side view showing long rostrum, on yarrow. Myrmecoris gracilis is found across the whole of northern and central Europe, as well as the western part of the northern Mediterranean.Wachmann, 2004 To the east it is common in Siberia, China and Korea. The bug lives on dry and warm to moderately damp, grassy open habitats. The adults can be seen climbing on grasses and herbaceous plants in cool damp weather. The species was formerly classed by the IUCN as \\"Rare\\" in its pre-1994 system; in the UK, the species had been recorded in 15 ten-kilometre squares or fewer at that time. It is described as a \\"not common\\" inhabitant of dry heathland in Britain, where it is confined to the far south of England in an area bounded by Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Luton and Eastbourne. In the Avon Gorge it forms 11.1% of the insect visitors to Trinia glauca. References  Sources  * M. Chinery: Collins Complete Guide to British Insects. Collins, 2005. Pages 96–97. . * E. Wachmann, A.

It was adapted from the play of the same name by Leonard Spigelgass, which was a Broadway hit in the 1959-1960 season, starring Gertrude Berg and Cedric Hardwicke. Plot Bertha Jacoby (Rosalind Russell), a Jewish widow, is convinced by her daughter Alice Black (Madlyn Rhue) to move from Brooklyn, New York to Tokyo in order for Bertha to be closer to her along with her husband Jerry Black (Ray Danton), now stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Her feelings about the Japanese with regards to her son's death in World War II start to change on board the ship to Tokyo, where she meets Koichi Asano, a Japanese Buddhist and businessman (Alec Guinness), who also lost a spouse and two children in the war. The two share a bond over lives, their families, and their faiths, which develops into a romance. When she announces to her family of Asano's courtship, her daughter and son-in-law object to the idea of an interracial marriage. Cast * Rosalind Russell as Bertha Jacoby * Alec Guinness as Koichi Asano * Ray Danton as Jerry Black * Madlyn Rhue as Alice Black * Mae Questel (credited as Mae Questal) as Essie Rubin * Marc Marno as Eddie * Gary Vinson as Mr. McMillan * Sharon Hugueny as Bride * Frank Wilcox as Noah Putnam * Francis De Sales as American embassy representative * Yuki Shimoda as Mr. Asano's Secretary * Harriet MacGibbon as Lily Putnam * Alan Mowbray as Captain Norcross (This was Mowbray's final film role.) * George Takei as Mr. Asano's majordomo Production Guinness went to Japan days prior to production started to study the culture, the people and their customs. He went under heavy makeup to play the role. Russell had misgivings about the role due to her believing that Berg deserved the part (though studio head Jack Warner refused due to doubts over Berg's viability), but she decided to portray the role after hearing that she could co-star with Guinness. The two called each other and agreed mutually to do it. Both actors were Catholic, different from what they portrayed in the film. Reception A. H. Weiler, film critic for The New York Times, called the film a \\"truly heartwarming and entertaining affair,\\" and opined that it was a \\"truthful, satisfying work largely because the combination of funny and apt dialogue and the dedicated cast give it dignity,\\" largely due to Russell's convincing performance as a \\"self-sufficient Brooklyn dowager,\\" although he thought that \\"Mr. Guinness still appears to be closer to London than to Tokyo.\\" A review in the trade magazine Variety declared \\"Leonard Spigelgass’ brew of schmaltz and sukiyaki is an outstanding film...Russell’s Yiddish hex- cent, though at times it sounds like what it is – a Christian imitating a Jew – is close enough to the genuine article. Guinness becomes Japanese through physical suggestion and masterful elocution.\\" However, in his 1994 autobiography, George Takei, a Japanese-American actor who later found fame playing Mr. Sulu in the original Star Trek, recalls that while playing a minor role in A Majority of One, he was \\"shocked\\" at the \\"grotesquely offensive\\" latex make-up applied to Guinness's eyes, and by the \\"incomprehensible gibberish\\" of his Japanese lines, producing a disappointing and \\"disastrous\\" performance. In February 2016, Andrea Passafiume, reviewing the film for Turner Classic Movies, wrote: \\"A Majority of One is a true hidden gem with warmth, humor and a message of tolerance and compassion that remains just as relevant today as it was in 1961.\\" Awards and nominations * Oscar for Best Color Cinematography (Harry Stradling, nominee) * Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures (Mervyn LeRoy, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding (winner) * Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy (winner, tied with West Side Story) * Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actress - Musical/Comedy (Rosalind Russell, winner) (Russell's fourth Golden Globe win) * Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Comedy (Leonard Spigelgass, nominee) See also * List of American films of 1961 * Whitewashing in film References External links 1961 films American films 1961 comedy films English- language films American films based on plays Films directed by Mervyn LeRoy Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance Warner Bros. films Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners Jews and Judaism in fiction Films set in Tokyo American comedy films Films about interracial romance Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"A Majority of One (film)"},{"id":"47210764","text":"The 2001 Navy Midshipmen football team represented the United States Naval Academy (USNA) during the 2001 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Spread over an area of about 320,000 square meters, Odessos is the largest well-equipped yard in Bulgaria suitable for repair and drydocking of vessels up to 35,000 DWT and afloat repairs of vessels up to 150,000 DWT. Odessos Shiprepair Yard is the most busiest yard in the Black Sea. The total length of berths are 1 153,5 m with an average depth of 6,35 m. The depth of the port varies from 5,30 m to 9,80 m. Odessos Shiprepair Yard S.A. has 17 cranes. The graving dock is equipped with one 30 t crane, two 15 t cranes and one 10 t crane. Floating dock No. 2 is equipped with two 15 t cranes and floating dock No. 3 is equipped with two 20 t cranes. Also available is a 100 t floating crane. History It is assumed that the date of birth of Odessos Shiprepair Yard, Varna, Bulgaria, is the day of 1 September 1955 when the Graving dock was commissioned at the Georgi Dimitrov shipbuilding and shiprepair yard. Some time after their foundation, the two main activities of the Georgi Dimitrov shipbuilding and shiprepair yard separated, so Odessos undertook the shiprepair services. The construction of the Graving dock was related at that time with the necessity for execution of emergency dock repairs of war ships in case of eventual military operations in the Black Sea basin during the Cold War. The first docked vessel was the Bulgarian M/V “Shipka”. This docking marked the commencement of service of the Graving dock.

Thomas Robinson Dipple was the publican for many years, from at least 1904 to 1921. Sometimes described as an \\"Irish\\" pub due to the large Irish community in the area, in the twentieth century the pub has been a favourite watering hole for supporters of the local football team Queen's Park Rangers.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) he remained loyal to the Second Spanish Republic. He was in command of the troops in Barcelona when a military revolt was attempted on 19 July 1936. He was imprisoned by the rebels, and after the revolt was relieved of his command. He was given command of the Army of the North in November 1936 but was not able to form a unified command. He was handicapped by regional jealousies and a mixed command of regular troops and militia. He was dismissed in May 1937 shortly before the north of Spain fell to the insurgents. He took refuge in Mexico after the war. Life Early career Llano de la Encomienda was born in 1879. He gained military experience in the Rif War in Morocco. He had two tours of duty in Morocco, where his performance was excellent. He was promoted to the rank of General in 1931. Barcelona command The Republican leaders trusted Llano de la Encomienda. They gave him command of the Barcelona division in February 1936, the 4th Division of the official army, although as a brigadier general he did not have the rank expected for that post. After General Francisco Franco launched his rebellion, Llano de la Encomienda told his officers on 18 July 1936 that he supported the Republican Union party, but given a choice between extremes would back the communists against the fascists. That day he assured the Catalan president Lluís Companys that there was no unrest among the troops in the Barcelona barracks. However, the troops began an uprising in the early hours of 19 July 1936 and captured key points in the city. There were 2,000 military rebels, but the Republicans had the support of the police and could call on 3,000 Civil Guards, 3,200 Assault Guards and 300 Mossos d'Esquadra. Llano de la Encomienda was indecisive in his response to the crisis. He continued to give orders and make telephone calls in an effort to stop the revolt, which caused some confusion among the rebels. The Nationalist General Manuel Goded Llopis arrived in the city from Majorca and imprisoned Llano de la Encomienda. Led by the anarchists of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) the workers organized themselves, joined by loyal troops and guards, and counterattacked the next day. After hard fighting they regained control of Barcelona. Llano de la Encomienda was dismissed from his command after the uprising. He was quarantined for a period, since after his poor performance during the revolt the Republican authorities were not completely sure of his loyalty. Army of the North Insurgent advances in the north March–September 1937 The Army of the North covered Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country. These regions maintained considerable political and military autonomy. In the mining region of Asturias the militias were led by Belarmino Tomás, head of the Popular Front committee for that region. The armed forces in Santander (Cantabria) were led by José García Vayas, formerly a battalion commander in Santoña. The Basque militias were militarized on 26 October 1936. José Antonio Aguirre, president of the Basque Country, set up and presided over a General Staff, placed war industries under control of the military and called up reservists. By 26 November 1936 the Basque forces numbered 25,000, with an artillery regiment and support services. They tried to form a Basque army, the Eusko Gudarostea, although the constitution prohibited this. On 15 November 1936 Llano de la Encomienda was sent to Bilbao. He replaced Captain Francisco Ciutat de Miguel. Although he was technically commander of the Republican Army of the North, he completely failed to form a unified command. He did not have clear instructions about the role he was to play, and friction soon developed with Aguirre. The commanders of the three militia forces resisted any interference. Llano de la Encomienda was even subjected to a customs inspection when crossing the \\"border\\" from Asturias to Santander at Unquera. A cheese was confiscated. In November 1936 Llano de la Encomienda launched an attempt to capture Vitoria. This was a key objective, since it would open land communications between the Basque Country and France. The attempt failed. 300px On 13 January 1937 Aguirre informed Llano de la Encomienda that the Basque Council of Ministers had agreed that the Basque Government and its Minister of War retained jurisdiction over all war-related matters, and the use of human and material resources, apart from the command of military operations. It acknowledged his role in coordinating joint actions of the Basque, Santander and Asturian forces, and promised to supply aid to the Santander and Asturias units where possible. In effect, Aguirre had removed the Basque forces from Llano de la Encomienda's command. On several occasions Llano de la Encomienda complained bitterly to Spanish prime minister Francisco Largo Caballero about Aguirre's refusal to cooperate. Aguirre later said the Llano de la Encomienda's military advisers had been plotting to undermine the Basque Staff. The Francoist General Emilio Mola began a campaign in the north on 31 March 1937. His first goal was to capture the industrial areas of Basque Country. The campaign was ruthless, using massive artillery strikes and bombing of cities such as Guernica to crush resistance. The Basque battalions finally obeyed Llano de la Encomienda's order to accept numbers and form into brigades. With the Insurgents advancing on Bilbao in April 1937, Aguirre asked for General José Asensio Torrado to be dispatched to Bilbao. The request was refused since Asensio was distrusted after the loss of Málaga. At the end of April Aguirre asked for General Sebastián Pozas Perea, saying Llano de la Encomienda was incapable of commanding the 60,000 men of the Basque forces. Aguirre called him \\"the personification of military incompetence.\\" Aguirre personally took military command in May. On 27 May 1937 Llano de la Encomienda was officially replaced by General Mariano Gámir Ulíbarri. Later career Bilbao fell on 19 June 1937. Llano de la Encomienda was in Gijón until the last moment, then escaped by sea to France. He returned to Barcelona, and was subject to a trial concerning his activities in the north, from which he was acquitted. Llano de la Encomienda was later placed in charge of training. In April 1938 he was no longer thought fit for active command, but was Inspector-General of Infantry. After the fall of Catalonia he returned to the central zone. At the end of the war he escaped to France, and soon after moved to Mexico, where he died in 1963.

In 1996, he obtained a grant to study and photograph spoons from around the world at the Smithsonian's repository in Suitland, MD.Sartorius, Norm (1996) Grant from the West Virginia Commission on the Arts to research and photograph wooden spoons from around the world at the Smithsonian Institution, Department of Anthropology Second, he stated in an interview that he \\"sees spoons\\" in everything, particularly in natural forms such as seedpods, leaves, flowers, and found and weathered objects.Stevens, 2014. (unpaginated) It has been noted that the influence of seashells, crustaceans, shore birds and other sealife often show through in this work.Pierotti, 2014, p.50 Third, he is inspired by the wood itself, particularly contrasting heartwood and sapwood colors, unusual grain, knots, textures, or weathering in a piece. Every piece he crafts, he has said, \\"starts with the wood itself.\\"Pierotti, 2014, p.50. He has estimated that the characteristics of the piece of wood itself suggest the size and shape of more than 75% of his finished pieces.Neff, 1995, p.9. Overall, he has described his creative approach as intuitive in that he reacts to the virtues of each piece of wood rather than forcing his own design intentions.Verbeten, 2013, p.37 \\"The wood is usually the inspiration for the first cuts,\\" he has said, \\"And the shape of the piece has to do with the texture, grain, and figure of it...\\"Pierotti, 2014, p.50 He has stated that he places his most interesting pieces of wood within sight of his workbench, often for months, to contemplate possible spoons may that lie within.Carlsen, 2012, p.31 Once he sees the spoon a piece can become, he has said, he acts quickly on the idea because he feels his creative inspirations cannot be turned on and off at will, but must be recognized and acted upon.Verbeten, 2013, p.37 Wood, tools, and work process Sartorius prefers to work with very dense hardwood, especially root wood and burls with contrasting heartwood and sapwood colors, figured grain, and unique character from knots, deformities, damage, weathering, or other idiosyncrasies.Neff, 1995, p.9. Frequently, he uses scraps or cutoffs sent to him by other woodworkers from around the world—often with an interesting background story.Neff, 1995, p.9. He, in turn, sends his scraps to carvers and jewelers who work at even smaller scale. The provenance of his raw materials contributes significantly to both the making and the sale of his spoons. He follows the same sequence of steps when crafting his spoons. First, he uses a bandsaw to roughly shape the overall form of the spoon. Then, an inflatable sanding drum with very coarse 24-grit sandpaper is used to remove saw marks, smooth out the facets of the cuts, and shape the convex curves of the exterior of the bowl. He determines the exterior shape first before working on the inside of the spoon bowl. \\"It fixes the outside form,\\" he has said, \\"which is sculpturally what one sees first.\\"Carlsen, Spike. (2012) p.31 A die grinder (rotary tool) with a carbide cutter is then used to remove mass from the concave interior of the bowl. Small cutters are used to further shape the piece, particularly the transition between the bowl and the handle, which he sees as particularly critical.Martin, 2006, p.23 The fine details of the spoon are made with a carving knife, then a die grinder with a ball-shaped burr is used to clean up and refine the interior of the spoon bowl. This is followed by hours of hand work, sanding, scraping, and polishing the work.

Its name as a social body is the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue (万国道德会 Wànguó Dàodéhuì) or simply the Church of the Way and its Virtue (道德会 Dàodéhuì), which is frequently translated as the Morality Church. Shanrendao can be viewed as one of the best examples of the jiàohuà (教化 \\"spiritual transformation\\") movements. It is one of the most prominent religions of redemption of China, and was formally established as the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in Shandong in 1921 by Jiang Shoufeng (1875-1926), a member of the Confucian Church (孔教会 Kǒngjiàohuì) of Kang Youwei. Kang Youwei himself was the president of the church during the last year of his life. The movement was concerned with a reconstitution of morality, at a time in which people no longer understood what morality means because of the decline of religion. By the 1930s the religion had a strong presence in Manchuria, where it persists to the present day.Heiner Fruehauf, Ph.D. All Disease Comes from the Heart: The Pivotal Role of the Emotions in Classical Chinese Medicine. § \\"The Power of Ritual and the Emotional Therapy System of the Confucian Educator Wang Fengyi (1864-1937)\\" (7-13). chineseclassicalmedicine.org. Archived on 31 December 2017. A great contribution came from Jiang Shoufeng's son, Jiang Xizhang (1907-2004), an intellectual prodigy who composed commentaries on the Confucian classics before the age of ten. Father and son composed vernacular versions of the classics in order to disseminate Confucianism among the Chinese masses. After the World War I, Xizhang wrote a leaflet, the Xizhanlun with anti-war teachings inspired by the content of the world religions. The strongest impetus in the social importance of the movement, however, came from Wang Fengyi (王凤仪 1864-1937), a charismatic healer and preacher of peasant origins who led the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in the 1930s. He is celebrated as a peasant saint throughout northeast China, a shànrén (善人 \\"virtuous man\\") with the epithet \\"Wang the Good\\" or \\"Virtuous King\\" (王善人), a wordplay as his surname means \\"king\\" or \\"ruler\\". Doctrine and practice Coloured symbol of Shanrendao theory. Wang Fengyi elaborated a doctrine and practice based on self-knowledge, self-realisation, and self-reliance, based on traditional Chinese theology and cosmology, especially the five elements (五行 wǔxíng) and the yinyang cosmology. The five elements constitute everything and also characterise the five behaviours of the human being. The harmony of the person and the society depends on the proper cultivation of these characters according to the different contexts. Shanrendao is deeply influenced by the Taizhou school of Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucianism, but the tradition synthesises the entirety of Chinese religion. Its goal is to find the roots of one's life; return to the principles of the bond between Heaven, Earth and humanity according to one's own experience. All kinds of human emotions are thought to arise from social interaction, from the family to the larger community. Wang Fengyi's teachings emphasise the role of emotion in healing. Reconciliation, gathering for ritual and storytelling (parables are taken from the Chinese tradition and the life of Master Wang) able to \\"turn the heart of the participants\\", are the primary practice of the movement. These methods are called \\"talking the disease away by appealing to one's higher nature\\". Three natures and Dao Wang Fengyi's doctrine holds that the human being tends to the five virtues of empathy (仁 rén), ritual and propriety (礼 lǐ), integrity and trust (信 xìn), justice and righteousness (义 yì), and wisdom (智 zhì), and to the five vices of anger (怒 nù), hatred (恨 hèn), blame (怨 yuàn), irritation and judgment (恼 nǎo), and annoyance and disdain (烦 fán). These tendences take part in the three natures of man, which they characterise more or less. The state of virtue is ① tiānxìng (天性, \\"heavenly nature\\", which can be translated as \\"natural disposition\\"), while the outward disposition (meaning the tendency to impose oneself on others) is ② bǐngxìng (禀性), and it is generally dominated by vices and selfishness. ③ Habits (xíxìng 习性) are neither of the two, and they are rather engendered by the necessity of interaction with the circumstances, which lead to certain choices and preferences. The aim of Wang's healing is to extinguish imposition of the self on others, and reduce habits, in order to deliver the heavenly nature of humanity. Tianxing is the state of Dào, and it is the integration and harmony of spirit, body and mind, of nature (性 xìng), heart (心 xīn) and body (身 shēn). Social doctrine The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue inherited Wang's teachings on the importance of the family, seen as the basis of citizenship and social regeneration. According to Wang's teachings the family institution has to be frugal and morally pure. Wang protested the inadequacy of historical religions, protesting that they neglected or demeaned women. Wang emphasised the importance of the woman in the institution of the family, and the necessity of women's education and independence in the Way. Wang Fengyi promoted an indigenous mass female learning movement which competed with the missionary schools of the Catholic Church in Manchuria.Li Ji. God's Little Daughters: Catholic Women in Nineteenth-Century Manchuria. University of Washington Press, 2015. . p. 17 Foundation and spread The Jiangs and Kang Youwei Jiang Shoufeng and his son Jiang Xizhang began to organise the movement in 1916. Jiang Shoufeng was originally a member of Confucian Church of Kang Youwei but was turned away by hard-line Confucian trends within the church. The Jiangs theorised that a moral foundation was needed for the Chinese in order to contrast French, British and Japanese colonialisms, which rested on a policy of destruction of the morality of the conquered populations. The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue was officially founded on 28 September 1921, the birthday of Confucius, in Tai'an, Shandong. The church attracted members from various backgrounds and government officials. Even the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid became a member of the church, and Kong Decheng (1920-2008), then Confucius' first descendant in direct line, became the honorary chairman. Kang Youwei, the \\"Martin Luther of Confucianism\\", founder of the Confucian Church, was the president of the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in 1926–27, the last year of his life. The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue underwent a significant reform in 1926-28 when Jiang Shoufeng died, Kang Youwei was ill and dying, and Jiang Xizhang went abroad. The leadership was taken by a capitalist from Heilongjiang, Du Yannian (1878-1957), who recruited the charismatic healer and preacher Wang Fengyi. Wang Fengyi's leadership Wang Fengyi (1864-1937). Wang Fengyi was born on 1 November 1864 to a peasant family of Wangjiayinzi village, Chaoyang, Rehe (nowadays Liaoning). His parents were Mongolian, and he was primarily a self-taught ox herder. He had an older brother, Wang Shutian (王树田), and two younger brothers, Wang Shushen (王树森) and Wang Shuyong (王树永). At the age of 23 he married Bai Shoukun (白守坤) and they had a son, Wang Guohua (王国华). Wang Fengyi did not receive a high education because of poverty, and at the age of 35 he realised the Dao and became a wandering healer and preacher of traditional Confucian morality. By the time of his contact with Du Yannian, Wang had already founded the Voluntary Schooling movement for girls, which by 1925 had established 250 schools throughout Manchuria. Wang's schools merged with the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, and by 1933 the church had 500 branches, 400 schools and 200.000 students in northeast China. Wang Fengyi gave a great impetus to the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, which in the 1930s had 8 million members in northeast China (25% of the population). Nowadays he continues to be celebrated as a peasant saint throughout the region, a shànrén (善人 \\"virtuous man\\") with the epithet \\"Wang the Good\\" or \\"Virtuous King\\" (王善人) as his surname means \\"king\\" or \\"ruler\\". Contemporary developments In mainland People's Republic of China the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue ceased to exist as a social organisation recognised by political authorities since the Communist Revolution of 1949 until recent decades. Shanrendao persisted as an \\"underground\\" movement across the Maoist period and the Cultural Revolution. Since the relaxation of antireligion policies in the 1980s the movement has resurfaced and it has grown back especially in its heartland, northeast China (Manchuria), where the members preach filiality and Wang Fengyi's healing methods, mostly organised in the form of house churches. Lineages of local healers are organised in \\"farms\\", and successfully employ storytelling, lectures on virtue, personal confessions, and a set of five chanted affirmations modeled on the five elements.Liu Yousheng's 劉有生 lectures: Let the Radiant Yang Shine Forth: Lectures on Virtue. Headquarters of the \\"Church of the Way and its Virtue\\" have been established again in Beijing in the 2010s. Wang Fengyi's teachings have also been adopted by the contemporary Beijing Confucian group Yīdān xuétáng (一耽學堂).

It lies at the origins and insertionMoore JC: The Golgi Tendon Organ: A Review and Update; American Journal of Occupational Therapy, April 1984 vol. 38 no. 4 227-236 of skeletal muscle fibers into the tendons of skeletal muscle. It provides the sensory component of the Golgi tendon reflex. The Golgi organ is not to be confused with the Golgi apparatus, which is an organelle in the eukaryotic cell, or the Golgi stain, which is a histologic stain for neuron cell bodies. All of these are named after the Italian physician Camillo Golgi. Structure The body of the organ is made up of braided strands of collagen (intrafusal fasciculi) that are less compact than elsewhere in the tendon and are encapsulated. The capsule is connected in series with a group of muscle fibers () at one end, and merge into the tendon proper at the other. Each capsule is about long, has a diameter of about , and is perforated by one or more afferent type Ib sensory nerve fibers (Aɑ fiber), which are large myelinated axons that can conduct nerve impulses very rapidly. Inside the capsule, the afferent fibers lose their medullary sheaths, branch, intertwine with the collagen fibers, and terminate as flattened leaf-like endings between the collagen strands (see figure).  Function  Mammalian tendon organ showing typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in spinal cord (middle) and expanded schematic (right). The tendon organ is a stretch receptor that signals the force developed by the muscle. The sensory endings of the Ib afferent are entwined amongst the musculotendinous strands of 10-20 extrafusal muscle fibers. See an animated version. When the muscle generates force, the sensory terminals are compressed. This stretching deforms the terminals of the Ib afferent axon, opening stretch-sensitive cation channels. As a result, the Ib axon is depolarized and fires nerve impulses that are propagated to the spinal cord. The action potential frequency signals the force being developed by 10-20 extrafusal muscle fibers in the muscle. Average level of activity in a tendon organ population is representative of the whole muscle force. The Ib sensory feedback generates spinal reflexes and supraspinal responses which control muscle contraction. Ib afferents synapse with interneurons that are within the spinal cord that also project to the brain cerebellum and cerebral cortex. The autogenic inhibition reflex assists in regulating muscle contraction force. It is associated with the Ib. Tendon organs signal muscle force through the entire physiological range, not only at high strain. During locomotion, Ib input excites rather than inhibits motoneurons of the receptor- bearing muscles, and it affects the timing of the transitions between the stance and swing phases of locomotion. The switch to autogenic excitation is a form of positive feedback. The ascending or afferent pathways to the cerebellum are the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts. They are involved in the cerebellar regulation of movement.  History  Until 1967 it was believed that Golgi tendon organs had a high threshold, only becoming active at high muscle forces. Consequently, it was thought that tendon organ input caused \\"weightlifting failure\\" through the clasp-knife reflex, which protected the muscle and tendons from excessive force. However, the underlying premise was shown to be incorrect by James Houk and Elwood Henneman in 1967.

He was Minister of Commerce and Industry from 11 November 1928 to 3 November 1929 in the governments of Raymond Poincaré and Aristide Briand. Early years Georges Edouard Félix Bonnefous was born in Paris on 30 November 1867. He studied law, and in 1890 joined the Paris Bar. He became general counsel of the Parliamentary Press Union. From 1896 to 1898 he was deputy chief of staff of André Lebon, Minister of the Colonies. He contributed articles on politics to newspapers such La Liberté. From 1900 to 1906 he published L'année politique (The Year in Politics). As a progressive conservative and moderate nationalist he was invited to contribute to La République française, the daily paper that served as the organ of the Fédération républicaine. Politician Bonnefous ran successfully for election as deputy for the 2nd district of Versailles in the 24 April – 8 May 1910 general elections. He sat with the Democratic Republican Union. He was reelected in the general election of 26 April 1914. During World War I (1914–18) he represented the views of the Fédération républicaine. As the stalemate dragged on in 1916 the left-leaning deputies began calling for parliamentary representatives to inspect the front. The right opposed this, since it would divide authority. Bonefous proposed that as a temporary measure a commission of forty deputies and forty senators should be given the authority to inspect. Parliament would meet weekly to register decrees issued by the government. After the war he ran successfully for reelection on the Republican list of the National Democratic Union on 16 November 1919. From 1919 to 1924 he headed the committees on Finance and Universal Suffrage. He was reelected for the National Democratic Union in the general election of 11 May 1924. He was elected once more in the general election of 22 April 1928. On 11 November 1928 Bonnefous was appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry in the fifth cabinet of Raymond Poincaré. The cabinet resigned on 27 July 1929 and was replaced by the 11th cabinet of Aristide Briand. Bonnefous remained Minister of Commerce and Industry until Briand's cabinet resigned on 22 October 1929. He was involved in discussions over trade agreements with Austria and Czechoslovakia. Bonnefous was reelected in the general election of May 1932. He did not seek reelection on 26 April 1936. After retiring he wrote several books, including the \\"Political History of the Third Republic\\". Georges Bonnefous died in Paris on 27 May 1956.

The field erupted basaltic to foiditic lavas from the Pliocene to the Holocene in Columba volcano with phreatomagmatic activity, and fumaroles were observed in the 16th-18th centuries in the Sierra de Valenzuela territory. Earlier activity has been subdivided in several phases. The first affecting mostly the centre of the field is K-Ar dated between 8.7 and 6.4 Ma. A second phase occurred in the Pleistocene 1.3 Ma and 0.7 Ma. The maars involve both hard-substrate maars formed in metasediments of the basement and soft-substrate maars in Pliocene unconsolidated sediments. Both types of maars are distributed in NE-SW and NW-SE directions following faults established during the Miocene. During the lower Pliocene, the system underwent uplift and erosion. Some maars contain sediments including travertine possibly related to carbon dioxide emissions. Gas emissions, sometimes increased following earthquake activity, are common in the field and include hydrogen sulfide, CO2 and water.

A charity called the CoderDojo Foundation operates out of Dublin and supports the various clubs by providing a central websiteCoderDojo Foundation Official Webpage and some other support services. Supporters of CoderDojo believe it is part of the solution to addressing the global shortageGlobally there is a monumental shortage of programmers with the EU predicting a shortfall of almost 1 million technical workers by 2020 of programmers by exposing young people to ICT at a young age. The movement has seen significant growth since its founding. The CoderDojo Foundation estimates 1,250 Dojos spread across 69 countries,Raspberry Pi and CoderDojo Join Forces with a growth rate of several new Dojos every week.  History  Founded in July 2011 by James Whelton & Bill Liao, the first Dojo took place in NSC Cork, Ireland, on 23 July. James and Bill were self-taught programmers and wanted to create a space where young people could learn code in a social environment. In less than one year, the CoderDojo movement was spread across Ireland and other cities like London in England and San Francisco in the United States. In May 2017, Raspberry Pi foundation merged with CoderDojo.  Press Coverage  CoderDojo received positive reviews from newspapers including BBC, CNN, The Guardian, The Irish Times and TechCrunch. In 2015, Salesforce announced a partnership and a grant of $200,000 to CoderDojo in order to help \\"support 14 CoderDojo code clubs – or Dojos – globally, with each of them being run by Salesforce.com \\"champions\\".  CoderDojo Girls  Many CoderDojo volunteers focus on improving the extreme shortage of women in technology In 2013, women made up 14 percent of all computer science graduates — down from 36 percent in 1984. This imbalance persists in the tech industry. by using specific strategies to engage girls. In particular, challenging the socially accepted idea among young women that the world of the computer sciences is \\"not for them\\". Some Dojos have even chosen to run special CoderDojo Girls sessions to encourage young women to participate in computer science. There has been some success with attracting girls into Dojos through making female mentors visible to newcomers.  CoderDojo Foundation  Established in mid-2013 by cofounder James Whelton, the CoderDojo Foundation is focused on supporting, scaling, and empowering the CoderDojo Community. With a small core team of 6 people based in Dogpatch Labs, Dublin, Ireland, the Foundation advises new and existing Dojos, develops resources to assist Dojos, and manages international partnerships and events on behalf of the Community.

He played a prominent part in the 1913 VFL Grand Final; his decision to handball in the final minutes, instead of shoot at goal, is often blamed as having cost St Kilda the premiership. South Melbourne Baird, a follower from Sunbury, first played for South Melbourne in the 1908 VFL season. He played once that year, then five games in 1909, a premiership season for South Melbourne. Not selected in the finals, Baird was however a member of the South Melbourne side which a week later defeated West Adelaide to claim the Championship of Australia. St Kilda In 1912 he was cleared to St Kilda and played 10 games in his first season at the club. He played 16 games in 1913, including the 1913 VFL Grand Final. 1913 VFL Grand Final St Kilda had qualified for its first grand final and came up against Fitzroy, the minor premiers. Baird started as one of St Kilda's followers, along with George Morrissey and Ernie Sellars. In the last quarter, which St Kilda began 25 points behind, Baird kicked the second of two early goals for St Kilda. Two goals to Morrissey reduced the margin to two points with only a few minutes remaining. Accounts of what happened next vary, but Baird is known to have taken a mark within range of goal, giving him an opportunity to put St Kilda in front, but instead the ball ended up with Morrissey who could only kick a behind. The Age wrote that Baird had \\"muddled things up\\" and it proved to be a turning point, as Fitzroy were able to kick two late goals to secure a 13-point win. Baird later recalled: This account was questioned by teammate Bob Bowden. He disputed that Morrissey had called for the ball and claimed that the handball had actually been aimed at him. Bowden recalled that Baird, after marking the ball clear from any opponent, attempted to handball to him but it came out the side of his hand and instead went towards the boundary line. It was there that Morrissey gathered the ball and shot for goal, from what Bowden called a \\"most difficult angle\\". New South Wales Paddington Baird played five games early in the 1914 VFL season, then was cleared to Sydney, where he signed with Paddington in the New South Wales Football League. His participation in the competition was put in doubt when the Sydney Football Club launched a protest, following a 70-all draw which he had taken part in. The club claimed that he had not lived in Paddington's district for the one-month requirement and was ineligible to play. In Baird's case, the one-month qualification was not believed to have been applicable due to a rule in which players who had come from other states could play on arrival. The issue was that his residence, although in Paddington and only 10 minutes walk from the club's ground, happened to be in the East Sydney district and he was living there up until the day before the match. Upon learning of the mistake, Baird had to move to Waverley in order to meet the residential qualifications, but this meant the one-month requirement was now applied. Citing disgust at how things had unfolded and anticipating further protests, Baird resigned from Paddington, but was persuaded out of retirement and once he was ruled eligible to play resumed his career. It was decided that the match between Sydney and Paddington would be replayed later in the season. Sydney however ended up forfeiting the match, as a win would not have affected their position on the ladder. He was vice-captain of the New South Wales team at the 1914 Sydney Carnival in August. In the third quarter of Paddington's 1914 semi-final loss to South Sydney, Baird was singled out for rough treatment by his opponents. The fighting became serious enough that the police were called to the ground and Baird had to take refuge in the pavilion. Baird was unavailable for much of the 1915 season—an ankle injury kept him on the sidelines and he then went down to Melbourne on holidays. With Paddington making the premiership decider, Baird travelled up to Sydney on the morning on the match. Paddington defeated Newtown by 18-points to claim its first premiership. North Sydney In 1921, Baird was elected captain of North Sydney, which were returning to the competition after they had gone into recess during the war. The club were able to win the premiership in its first season back, with Baird featuring in the premiership team, along with four other former VFL players, Les Charge, Herb Friend, Bryan Rush and Gerald Ryan. Later life Baird was involved in football administration at the time of his death in 1947; he had been assistant secretary of St Kilda the previous season.

Location The Harringay Warehouse District forms the south eastern part of the Harringay neighbourhood. Its southern border is formed by the New River and its northern boundary by the Gospel Oak to Barking Line. Its western and eastern boundaries are roughly defined by a line drawn between the railway and the New River along the eastern end of Sainsbury's and by the Seven Sisters Road. Character Although little industry now remains, as the name suggests, the district was developed out of Harringay's former industrial area. Except for those few that are used for purely commercial purposes, most of the remaining industrial buildings have become home to a growing number of live-work spaces. Inhabited by a largely creative community, until recently the development of the area was in the main undertaken without official sanction. Recently however, the residents have engaged with the local council. As a result, the area and its development as a mixed live-work zone is now part of the recently published Haringey Council Site Allocations Plan.Local Plan: Site Allocations DPD, London Borough of Haringey, April 2015 History The Harringay Warehouse District developed in the early years of the twentieth century. It became one of the main centres of employment of the former Municipal Borough of Tottenham. Some of the main industries were: *Piano manufacture – Harringay was one of the UK's main centres of piano manufacture and was home to household names such as Challen, Boyd, Barrett & Robinson and Eavestaff. *Confectionery including the main manufacturing centre for Maynards *Furniture making and shop-fitting, including HK Furniture, George Hammer & Co, and Courtney Pope. Other industries included the manufacture of paper tableware, flexible tubing for use in engineering, printing ink, industrial thermometers, radio valves and cathode ray tubes, industrial saws, shaving brushes, rafia, early photographic slides, electrical components and shoes. By the 1980s most of the bigger employers had moved out of the area, to be replaced by small- scale garment manufacture and other light industry. In the following decade, creative industries began to get a foothold and companies including Rough Trade Records moved in.

He was one of the leaders of the Communist Youth Union of Spain. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) he was general director of Propaganda in the government of Juan Negrín. He became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain. Life Early years Federico Melchor was born in Madrid on 10 April 1915. As a boy he spent time at the Casa del Pueblo. He became a militant in the youth organization of the Socialist Party. He was editor of the weekly paper Renovación. He became secretary of the Socialist Youth in Madrid. He became a member of the National Executive of the Socialist Youth of Spain (Juventudes Socialistas de España, JSE), and editor of Claridad. Writing in the 21 December 1933 issue of Rundschau, the German-language journal of the Communist International, Melchor said the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de España, PCE) organizations had tried to take leadership of the mass revolts that took place in Spain that month, and in some cases succeeded. According to the anarchist José Peirats this is completely untrue, and the communists gave no support to the revolts. Melchor was selected for the JSE executive committee at the fifth congress held in 1934. He visited Moscow in February–March 1936 with Santiago Carrillo, José Laín Entralgo, Trifón Medrano Lherba, Felipe Muñoz Arconada and Juan Ambou. He returned via Austria and Switzerland. In 1936 Melchor, Carrillo, Laín and José Cazorla were socialist members of the national liaison committee for unification of the communist and socialist youth. The new organization, the Unified Socialist Youth (Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas, JSU), adhered to the Communist Youth International as a \\"sympathizer\\". The JSU committed itself to being a \\"new style\\" Popular Front youth movement as described by the Communist International. Civil war During the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) Melchor was a captain in the \\"October\\" militia battalion. He was appointed head of the forces of Security, Assault and the National Guard under Santiago Carrillo, Councillor of Public Security in the Madrid Defense Council. Other key posts in Carrillo's department were held by Luis Rodríguez Cuesta (secretary of the Council), Segundo Serrano Poncela of the General Directorate of Security (Dirección General de Seguridad, DGS), Fernando Claudín Pontes (Press Cabinet) and Alfredo Cabello (Emisión Radiofónica). All these men were either members of the PCE already, or would soon become members. The police squads formed by trade unions or political parties were replaced by full-time security forces that the communists dominated. Melchor transferred from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español, PSOE) to the PCE in November 1936. The PCE opposed socialization of industry, which the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) supported. If the workers assumed control of the factories, that would run against communist policy of state ownership and would also weaken middle class support for Soviet foreign policy. Melchor outlined the official Communist Party position when he said, \\"We are not making a social revolution today; we are developing a democratic revolution, and in a democratic revolution, the economy ... cannot be launched into Socialist channels. If we are developing a democratic revolution and say we are fighting for a democratic republic, how can we attempt in the economic field to introduce methods of a totalitarian Socialist type?\\" He also noted that if foreign capital were not protected, that \\"would be an error in international relations because then England would decisively intervene against Spain not on our side but with Franco, because England has economic interests in our country to defend.\\" Under the government of Juan Negrín the Sub-secretariat of Propaganda was headed by Leonard Martín Echevarría of the Republican Left. Juan José Domenchina, also of the Republican Left, headed the Spanish Information Service. Melchor was made Director General of Propaganda. In January 1938 Melchor was replaced as undersecretary of propaganda by the architect Manuel Sánchez Arcas. The Left Republican Carlos Esplá became the Republic's first minister of propaganda. During the civil war Melchor was also secretary of the JSU militias, contributed to the daily Ahora, and directed the daily Trincheras. He escaped to France when the Republic fell in 1939. Later years In Paris Melchor edited the JSU journal Juventud. At the start of World War II (1939-45) he was expelled from France and sailed to Mexico. There he edited España Popular and the Boletín de Información Sindical of the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT, General Union of Workers). He represented the JSU in Mexico. After the war he returned to Europe and joined the JSU executive. He was editor for Radio España Independiente in Bucharest. After returning to Paris he ran a PCE information bureau and the weekly Información Española. He returned to Spain clandestinely to direct Mundo Obrero before the PCE was legalized in 1977. He then directed the journal openly in Madrid. He did in Madrid on 11 September 1985 at the age of 70.

Most of his work was published in Paris from 1633 to 1635. Among his colleagues were Melchior Tavernier (1594–1665), Sébastien Cramoisy (1584–1669) and Michael van Lochum (1601–1647). Little is known of his personal life.  Career  Up to 1631 Christophe Tassin was a French Royal Engineer and Geographer (Ingenieur et Geographe du Roy)., working on assigned political and military projects. As part of his appointment, he received the right to publish his work for ten years, though he used it only for 1633–1638. (His successor as Royal Engineer and Geographer and publisher was Sébastien de Beaulieu [1612–1674].) In 1633 Tassin published an atlas of France and Spain, Cartes généralis des provinces de France et d’ Espagne; one of Germany, Cartes généralis des royaumes et provinces de la haute et basse Allemagna; and one of the Low Countries, Plans et profils des principales villes du duché de Lorraine, avec les cartes generale et partuculieres de chacun gouvernement d’iucelles.

In 1635 he published at atlas of Switzerland, . His inclusion of the low countries in a single volume had a practical reason: In 1631 a great part of the region had been conquered by King Louis XIII of France, which caused a need for rapidly published information. In 1644 Tassin ended his work, and sold his copper plates of maps to Antoine de Fer (16xx–1673), who published them in many subsequent editions.

Early newspaper accounts of events were followed by papers on the precursor Bábí religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion. The community began to coalesce being near to Green Acre, founded by Sarah Farmer, who publicly espoused the religion from 1901. From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Baháʼís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913. Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days. Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion. In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as Urbain Ledoux, Sadie and Marby Oglesby, James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., Nancy Bowditch, and Guy Murchie. The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion as well as a racially integrated community since 1935. Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Baháʼís themselves. Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation. The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area. Over the last couple of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children's classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion. Firsts Mention of Bábí period The first mention related to the history of the Baháʼí Faith known in Massachusetts concerns news of Bábism in Qajar Persia, which Baháʼís hold as a direct precursor akin to the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus. This was a newspaper article printed in the Boston Courier December 29, 1845, reporting on events from the previous June. It is an echo of the original published in the London Times Nov 1, 1845. This Boston mention repeated January 1846 in the Boston Evening Transcript, the Christian Witness and Church Advocate, In February in the Christian Journal out of Exeter, New Hampshire, and then again later in June 1847. In Baháʼí records this event is reported in The Dawn-Breakers following Quddús' arrival in Shiraz after the pilgrimage of the Báb. The next newspaper reference to events of this period was in November 1850, echoing newspaper articles as early as the previous July. =Austin Wright= The first \\"paper\\" on events of this period is a letter written to the American Oriental Society which was holding its meeting in Boston and the library of materials was held at the Boston Athenæum. The letter was originally published as part of the minutes of the Society in The Literary World of June 14, 1851, as an untitled entry whose first quote is \\"notice of a singular character, who has for some years past played a prominent part on the stage of Persian life\\" dated February 10, 1851 by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright. It is considered the first paper giving an account on Bábism, though it makes mistakes typical of the period. See also Josephus on Jesus. It was subsequently also published in a Vermont newspaper June 26, 1851, and a translation was published in a German newspaper. Wright, father of Lucy Myers Wright Mitchell and John Henry Wright, was a medical missionary from New England to Persia among the Nestorian Christians. Wright followed up with another paper/letter \\"A short chapter in the history of Bâbeeism in Persia\\" to the Society published in May 1853. Donations to the Society, while mentioned in the first paper, are not listed actually being cataloged, however another donation in 1856 is noted when another set were sent. The library of materials of the period was first kept under Charles Folsom at the Boston Athenæum until 1855, then the materials were moved to New Haven and accepted at Yale University in July. The collection was dispersed and then regathered, purged and organized in 1905 by Hanns Oertel. By 1930 the only Bábí related texts in the collection were later works that had been gathered by E. G. Browne. Wright died in what was then called Urumiah, in Qajar Persia, January 14, 1865. =Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch= Bostonian Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch wrote about the religion following the work of Frenchman Ernst Renan who wrote The Origins of Christianity: The apostles in 1866. see also Bulfinch had been a Unitarian minister since 1830 but resigned circa 1860 when he accepted the Trinity Doctrine. Across some 11 pages Bulfinch made comparisons between the Báb and Jesus mostly positive though he also calls the religion a \\"delusion\\". He marks the court examination of the claims of the Báb like the examination of Jesus (suggesting the account may in fact have been copied), then after while continues: =James T. Bixby= Though later than the Bábí period perse, Unitarian minister born, educated, and worked often in Massachusetts, James Thompson Bixby wrote about the religion in 1897 and made a student journal of Boston College doing so. He also later lectured on the religion in 1901 at Green Acre. Bixby also turned his attention to the Baháʼí period. He published an article on the religion in August 1912 in the North American Review, after he had offered it to the Baháʼís to review. Objecting to it, an interview with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was subsequently arranged in April 1912 and published in Star of the West in August as well. Bahá´í period firsts Though the religion was established in the United States before 1900, by then no more than a dozen Baháʼís were in New England.The Baha'i Faith in America - Origins 1892-1900, vol 1, by Robert Stockman, 1985, pp. 4–5, 36–37, 95, 130–131, 209 Compared to the early growth in other places, and massive growth in South Carolina decades later, the region had relatively little Millennium interests - see Second and Third Great Awakening and the Burned-over district. Nevertheless, individuals from, educated in, or lived their lives in, Greater Boston were among the first Baháʼís of the United States. At the same time some perhaps well meaning if inaccurate reviews or even misinformed views of the Bábist/Baháʼí views were done as early as 1900.Thornton Chase (February 22, 1847 – September 30, 1912) was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and was a U.S. businessman and writer; he was commonly recognized as the first convert to the Baháʼí Faith of Occidental background. During his life he organized many Baháʼí activities in Chicago and Los Angeles and is considered a prominent Baháʼí. In 1895 Kate Ives, née Cowan, of Orleans, Massachusetts, may have been the first woman born in the United States to accept the Baháʼí Faith, and was the first Baháʼí to move to Boston in 1899. =Sarah Farmer, Green Acre and the first Baháʼí community of Boston= The Green Acre Baháʼí School is established in Eliot, Maine, at the northern edge of Greater Boston becoming an important learning center for Baháʼís and non-Baháʼís in Greater Boston and across the United States. Maria P. Wilson was in the company of Sarah Farmer on a trip overseas when they learned of the religion in 1900 from Josephine Locke and Elizabeth Knudson.Early History of the Baháʼí Community in Boston, Massachusetts, by Anise Rideout. date before 1982 - see citation #88 in Farmer was publicly linked with the religion in June 1901 after she had found truth in various religions and quasi-religious groups. * But of the Baháʼí Faith, it was explained, \\"...she has found the common faith in which all devout souls may unite and yet be free.\\" It was then announced Green Acre would be a place to learn of the religion, run in parallel with the other classes already established, but for free. Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl, among the most scholarly trained Baháʼís of the time, was there.Ali Kuli Khan, to serve as his translator, arrived in the United States in June. Abu'l-Faḍl had accompanied Anton Haddad, the first Baháʼí to live in the United States, on his return trip to America. They had been sent by then head of the religion, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The later well known Baháʼí Agnes Baldwin Alexander was also there. News of the Boston area community began to be noted in the newspapers.It was at these classes with Abu'l-Faḍl Mary Hanford Ford is considered to have joined the religion. Ford moved to the Boston area for a couple years. It was not her first time in Boston. She, Ali Kuli Khan, and the Breeds, whom she introduced to the religion, were soon active as a community in Boston area. By December 1901 Baháʼís in Chicago knew she was a Baháʼí and working with Sarah Farmer on projects. Ford was noted in Boston in November 1903 giving her talk on \\"The Holy Grail\\", and news of the mistreatment of Bábís/Baha'is in Persia was noted in August 1903. Khan was soon visible living in Boston in 1904,and Khan had married Bostonian Baháʼí, Florence Breed in 1904. Alice Ives Breed, Florence's mother, originally from Pavilion Illinois, born Jan 15, 1853, was a leading philanthropist socialite of the area. Ford would return for a talk a decade later. Other Baháʼís noted in the period are: Oscar S. Greenleaf was the first Baha'i in Springfield, Massachusetts, Henry Goodale, and Maria P. Wilson soon moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1902.

It is unknown if he was ever aware of Ali Kuli Khan's appearance at Harvard as a guest of James in 1905, but he moved to Urbana, Illinois and served a Unitarian congregation near the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, arriving in September 1906. The first known connection with Baháʼís is when Vail's group hosted \\"Amir Ullah Fareed\\", who was listed as a student of the Medical College of the University, and who spoke on April 28, 1907. Fareed circulated some early printed prayers visible in Boston and would serve as one of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's translators in 1912. Growing community After marrying in 1904, Khan gave a talk at Alice Ives Breed home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By 1905 regular Baháʼí meetings were established in Boston whether in homes or in public venues. Khan was visible at a women's club meeting in March 1905 at Sewall Hall. Baháʼís began to be profiled in the news in 1909. Mary Lucas, returned from her pilgrimage, published an account of her journey. Lucas would be visible at occasional Baháʼí events until her death in 1934. Harlan Ober in 1907Alfred E. Lunt (1910)Harlan Ober and Alfred E. Lunt were Bostonians who joined the religion in the summer of 1905 at Green Acre with Ober learning of the religion first through Alice Buckton, and then Lunt learned of the religion from Ober. Ober had been in shipping interests. Ober and Lunt were leaders in Republican party politics on college campuses, in the era of the Fourth Party System also known as the Progressive Era. Ober's parents lived in Beverly, Massachusetts, and Lunt was a Harvard Law school graduate. Picture of Lunt In the summer of 1906 Stanwood Cobb learned of the religion from a series of articles in the Boston Transcript and went to Green Acre to learn more of the religion. He successively conversed with Sarah Farmer and Mary Lucas. Thornton Chase was also there giving a series of talks. It was on that occasion that Cobb joined the religion. By the Winter of 1906 Louis Bourgeois, later architect of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, and his wife had joined the religion after having \\"come into association with the Baha'i Faith through Marie Watson and Mary Hanford Ford.\\"Bourgeois, Jean-Baptiste Louis (1856-1930) - Designer of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at Wilmette, Illinois, United States of America, R. Jackson Armstrong-Ingram, Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, Vol. 1, no. 7 (September, 1997) Khan and his family went on Baháʼí pilgrimage in 1906. Circa early 1907 or late 1906 Ober went on Baháʼí pilgrimage and was asked to go with Hooper Harris on a trip to India promulgating the religion, an effort noted as lasting \\"...no less than seven months, in India and Burma, visiting Bombay, Poona, Lahore, Calcutta, Rangoon and Mandalay.\\" ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's guidance to them amounted to behaving very differently than Christian missionaries. Ober returned and was visible at Green Acre late summer 1907. Ober went on a second pilgrimage in May 1909 with the MacNutt family and others. One early joke in the history of the religion comes from Ober about whether he was going to India or America ... > One day in the Holy Land He told Harlan Ober, an American Baháʼí, that he > was to go to India. Harlan Ober did travel far and wide in the interests of > the Faith, but at that particular time he did not cherish making that > journey. A few days later ʻAbdu'l-Bahá told him to go to America. \\"But > Master,\\" Ober said, \\"I thought I was going to India.\\" \\"So did Christopher > Columbus,\\" ʻAbdu'l-Bahá replied. Lunt continued to be active in Republican politics in 1908 and was visible at Green Acre in 1909. The Khans returned and he was visible in Boston by 1908. That year the first Baháʼí governing board was elected, the forerunner of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Boston. The community sent a delegate to the first national convention in 1909,and the existence of the community was noted in a national journal. The first known meeting in a public meeting space was held November 7, 1909. The following were present: Harriet Sprague, Lily Ostburg, Frances Godard, Helen Campbell, Francis Harding, Anise Rideout, Julia Culver, Raffie Esphahani, Althea Dorr, George Ostburg, Maria P. Wilson, Alice Ives Breed. On March 24, 1910 the assembly was composed of: officers Harlan Ober, Grace Robarts, Julia Culver, George Ostburg, and members Mrs. H. Sprague; Mrs. F. Goddard, Alice Ives Breed, Helen Campbell, and Mrs. E. Flees. Notable speakers at events in the Boston community included Stanwood Cobb, Lua Getsinger, and Edna McKinney. Khan was then appointed Iranian Charge D'Affaires in Washington D. C. in 1910. In 1911 Lunt was visible as a solicitor for Beverly, Mass., member of the national executive board of the Baháʼís, and participating in a Bostonian Baháʼí Naw-Rúz commemoration with guests. Fannie Fern Andrews of Boston was the second vice president of the Persian Educational Society in 1912 with strong connections to the religion. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in the area ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, during his trip to the United States ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, embarked on travels to the West following release from imprisonment and was anticipated coming to Boston.=Arrival in United States= Before coming to Boston, on 23 April 1912, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá attended several events. One was a reception in Washington D. C. by the Persian Charge D'Affaires Ali Kuli Khan, and the Turkish Ambassador; at this reception ʻAbdu'l-Bahá moved the place-names such that the only African-American present, Louis G. Gregory, was seated at the head of the table next to himself, an event that was highly noted at the time and since. One of the early versions of the story of this event was told by Harlan Ober. In Boston newspaper reporters asked ʻAbdu'l-Bahá why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough. A full page summary of the religion was printed in the New York Times. A booklet on the religion was published late April out of Boston. Mohonk Mountain House, a resort hotel located on the Shawangunk Ridge On 14 May ʻAbdu'l-Bahá went to northern New York state to Lake Mohonk addressing the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration and stayed at the Mohonk Mountain House. His talk was covered by many publications including one from Boston, and began > When we consider history, we find that civilization is progressing, but in > this century its progress cannot be compared with that of past centuries. > This is the century of light and of bounty. In the past, the unity of > patriotism, the unity of nations and religions was established; but in this > century, the oneness of the world of humanity is established; hence this > century is greater than the past. Harlan Ober and Grace Robarts, (who had learned of the religion from Lua Getsinger,) were married July 1912 with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá attending. Grace served as housekeeper and hostess for ʻAbdu'l-Bahá during his journeys in America. =First Boston visit= ʻAbdu'l-Bahá left from New York City on the 22nd of May for Boston where he would be for four days. On the evening of his arrival he addressed a Unitarian convention then going on. There was an audience of some three thousand including hundreds of Unitarian ministers. On the 23rd he visited a Greek-Syrian relief agency, a special meeting at University of Worcester, Massachusetts, and a party for his birthday was held during which he spoke of the importance of the Báb though he also lamented the cake, which had flags of United States, Persia, and the UK, wasn't big enough to hold flags from all countries. On the 24th he met with individuals, a talk before some Unitarians, another in Brookline, and then a talk at the home of a Baháʼí. On the 25th he met with individuals. Sometime during this visit is the incident where William Randall delivered grape juice for ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. =Second Boston visit= ʻAbdu'l-Bahá arrived for the second time in Boston July 23 but sent most of the entourage ahead to Dublin, NH. That evening he addressed an audience at a hotel as well as a later one in the home of the Breeds. On the 24th he spoke with individual visitors and for a talk before a club. Some from the club followed him back from that talk and on return there was also a line of people waiting for him at the hotel that evening. He also spoke to the Boston Theosophical Society. On the 25th he met with individuals before he left for Dublin. =Dublin, NH= From July 26 to August 16 he was in Dublin. He often met with individuals and small groups or made short trips to visit nearby Baha'is and a camp for youth. He also carried on with corresponding through letter across the United States and to Europe. One evening he announced the betrothal of Louis G. Gregory and Louisa Mathew and astonished the crowd. Elders with ear trumpets listened. Once he took his Persian entourage aside and spoke comparing feasts of kings that were brilliant but had no enthusiasm while there they ate modestly and in hard circumstances or so it seemed but everywhere there was real enthusiasm of the heart. On August 11 he was noted speaking to a local Unitarian church with answers to questions of such length and detail that it was claimed he must have memorized the answers beforehand. He compared his yearning to see the audience to the Apostles that traveled far to see people. From there he left for Green Acre August 16. =Green Acre= Photograph of Abdul-Baha visiting Green Acre, United States, in 1912 He then went to Eliot, Maine from 16 to 23 Aug, where he stayed in Green Acre. Some five or eight hundred people were there to hear the first talk. The talk was about ways of knowing the truth - he disavowed individual approaches like pure reason, simple authority, individual inspiration, etc., but affirmed: > [A] statement presented to the mind accompanied by proofs which the senses > can perceive to be correct, which the faculty of reason can accept, which is > in accord with traditional authority and sanctioned by the promptings of the > heart, can be adjudged and relied upon as perfectly correct, for it has been > proved and tested by all the standards of judgment and found to be complete. Some in the audience repudiated their former beliefs of inspiration as pure truth. At other talks members of the audience wept during his prayers or fainted. He spoke to a girls club camp group by the river on August 19. Fred Mortensen arrived August 20. Mortensen had been a criminal that fled arrest - his lawyer was Baháʼí Albert Hall of Minnesota from whom he learned of the religion. Riding from Minneapolis to Cleveland he then went on to Green Acre - all by way of Freighthopping. Being introduced in a crowd he was embarrassed at his dirty appearance and then was told to sit down amid the company of people in fine dress and wait but soon ʻAbdu'l-Bahá returned and began to speak closely with Mortensen. His inquiry revealed how Mortisen had traveled and Mortisen felt kindness from ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Mortisen had arrived on a day ʻAbdu'l-Baha had arranged as a feast. On the last day at Green Acre he met with individuals and left the 23rd. =Malden, Massachusetts= His final destination in New England was Malden, Massachusetts at the home of Maria P. Wilson, originally of Boston, where he stayed from 23 to 29 August. In Malden he spoke to various groups  a New Thought movement, a women's suffrage group, a metaphysical thought group, and a theosophical group. He also attended a marriage ceremony of Clarence Johnson and Ruby Breed, daughter of Alice Breed and sister to Florence Breed Khan. Albert Vail accompanied William H. Randall meeting ʻAbdu'l-Bahá there in late August.The detailed moment Vail met ʻAbdu'l-Bahá is unknown. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá arrived in Malden August 23 - and Vail was in Illinois by August 28 - Vail would later mark this as a pivotal point for his life but at first he didn't remark on it publicly. Later he said: > Six years ago I met a servant of God named Abdul Baha, so universal in mind, > brilliant in utterance, so pure, so radiant with universal love, so majestic > in the power of his holy spirit that I became convinced he and his equally > perfect and glorious father, Baha o'llah, were God's own messengers of light > and salvation to our modern world ... ʻAbdu'l-Bahá then left for Montreal where he arrived near midnight on 30 August 1912. After affects of the visit A number of individuals and institutions became more prominent after ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's travels through the region. =Albert Vail= As early as January 1913 Albert Vail, then a Unitarian Minister, was visible promulgating the religion, and was listed as the delegate to the \\"Bahai Temple Unity\\" national convention from the Urbana Baháʼí community. He reported on developments in Urbana Illinois of study of the Baháʼí teachings and seems to quote the Writings saying: \\"It is remarkable to observe how the Spirit seems to catch and hold one, and the whole life seems set aflame as to the Truth. There is a mystery, a force in the Cause far above the ken of men and angels.\\" and then spoke with an eloquence that moved and thrilled the audience. In a separate account of the convention, it was noted he was the final speaker of the meeting and that his \\"discourse was unique in penetrating power and beauty of utterance among all the eloquent addresses of the Convention\\" and that the chair had stopped reviewing the watch to limit speakers. Both accounts lamented that the speech was not written down but one said it traced the proofs of Manifestation, noting the martyrdoms of Persia, the need of divine authority to solve human problems, and the lives of the Central Figures of the Faith. Vail was officially recognized to have joined the religion years later, after the majority of his congregation insisted he stop promoting the religion. =Green Acre and contributing to the national leadership= In the summer of 1913 Baháʼís felt a strength of organization to attempt to win control of the board of Green Acre. Following this Kate Ives, the first Baháʼí of Boston, wrote a letter to the editor inviting Portsmouth residents to a talk on the religion. In 1914 Alfred E. Lunt was Secretary of the annual convention to elect the national leadership and was himself then elected along with William Henry Randall. In Spring 1915 Baháʼís gathered for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition - among them were Harlan Ober and Alfred E. Lunt. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote a letter about Expo thanking those that gathered. Following this Randall and Ober and others were visible at Green Acre. Sarah Farmer changed her will to bequeath Green Acre to the Baháʼís in the event of her death and her family involuntarily committed her to a mental institution in 1915 Randall lead the idea of rescuing her executed in combination by Randal, Ledoux, and Montford Mills, ultimately gathering a chief of police and a judge to accompany a court order to effect her freedom. Meanwhile, Lunt again served on the national board of Baháʼís this time as president, with Ober as secretary. Meanwhile, Ober wrote a letter to the editor of the Boston Post about the religion and Green Acre. Farmer died, shortly after being released, in 1916. The eulogy was read by Kate Ives and attending were Lunt, Ober, and Randall among others of Boston and the area. Ober was noted an officer of Green Acre along with Lunt. The Baháʼís held meetings for the 1917 national convention at Green Acre and Boston. Alfred E. Lunt Lunt was on the summer schedule at Green Acre in 1917, and performed a funeral program there in July 1918. Lunt gave a series of talks in Chicago in May 1919, as well as on the question of the minimum wage in 1922. Lunt was noted on the board of trustees of Green Acre 1925, and served on the national assembly in 1928. In 1930 Lunt gave a talk in New York, and published \\"The Supreme Affliction: A Study in Baháʼí Economics and Socialization\\".The Supreme Affliction: A Study in Baháʼí Economics and Socialization\\" by Alfred E. Lunt, in \\"The Baháʼí World\\", vol. 4 (1930-32), (New York: Baháʼí Publishing Committee 1933), pp. 435-60 Lunt was at a Temple dedication in 1931. In 1937 Lunt was visible giving a talk in New York again. William Randall In 1917 Randall was noted speaking in Montreal in March. Randall was again elected to the national board and that year he was elected as president of the board. Randall was again elected, this time as national treasurer, in 1918. In 1919 Randall accompanied Vail on pilgrimage and his account was read verbatim to the national convention in the United States. He was listed as the contact for announcing events and reserving rooms at Green Acre in 1920 by Albert Vail. Randall was appointed to the supervisory board of the Baháʼí periodical Star of the West in 1922, and contributed an article on Green Acre. In 1923 he was noted as chairman of the board of Green Acre while continuing as treasurer for the national community for the newly designated National Spiritual Assembly. In 1925 it was announced the administrative offices of the religion would be run from Green Acre. Randall also took part in the 1928 Race Amity Convention held at Green Acre. Perhaps Randall's final appearance was August 1928 at a commemoration of the visit of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to Green Acre. Randall died Feb 11, 1929 and a cable from Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, stating: \\"Grief stricken passing Harry Randall. Distinguished and Beloved Servant of Baháʼu'lláh. Assure family and friends fervent prayers, heartfelt condolences in behalf Holy Leaves and myself. Hold befitting Memorials -signed Shoghi.\\" The Obers Harlan Ober was elected to the national executive broad in 1917, and was at the 1919 national convention held in New York at which the Tablets of the Divine Plan, a series of letters about promulgating the religion intra- and-internationally following World War I were officially presented,Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation Revealed by Abdul Bahá ʻAbbas (presented in talks given by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab at the eleventh Annual Maskrekol-Azkar Convention, Baháʼí Congress, And Feast of El-Rizwan, April Twenty-Sixth to April Thirteenth, Inclusive, Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen, Hotel McAlpin, New York City). following which he gave talk at a Chicago meeting in May. Letters suggesting that Baháʼís take up \\"deeds, not words\\" following the Red Summer (1919) race riots arrived to Ober and soon there were Race Amity Conventions. In 1920 Ober was present in Syria for the Knighting of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.picture of knighting, Harlan is man on far right next to Grace holding the white paper - Randall was elected to the national board again in 1920 as treasurer and addressed the convention. In 1928 Ober gave a talk in Brooklyn, and Grace hosted an evening social at Green Acre. Ober gave a talk in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1929. In 1930 Ober returned to Pennsylvania to give another talk, and was also noticed in Brooklyn. 1931 Ober was with Louis Gregory for a talk. The Ober family purchased a home near Green Acre in 1932 and Harlan soon was reading on the radio at WHEB weekly after noon from Spring into the Fall from 1933 into 1935,(with occasional gaps.)       Grace spoke at the Portsmouth chapter of Hadassah and Harlan was also visible at other events - a funeral, and several series of talks in 1933. In 1933 he also gave a program series on \\"Psychology and Life\\" for Alpha Beta sorority and a ladies club. In November 1934 Ober gave a talk in Eliot for the Christian Endeavor Society, a Zeta Alpha Men's Club of a Baptist church. The family wintered in New York to February 1935, and their college student daughter visited them in the summer of 1935. Ober was a substitute speaker in January 1936 at Green Acre, and lead a funeral there. Grace died immediately after giving a talk at the Chicago Baha'i national convention in April 1938 - Harlan was then serving on the national spiritual assembly after traveling in Louisville Ky.Harlan gave his next talk at Green Acre that July, (noted radio personality too,) toured universities in Dec 1938, and served on the Green Acre summer committee for the school in 1939. That fall he was in the Golden Gate International Exposition in October 1939 with Louis G. Gregory, and spoke at an evening meeting. In 1940 he gave a talk at the Baháʼí Temple, and was again elected to the national assembly. In 1941 he is noted among the Green Acre management for the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada (as it was then). Their son married at the later summer. In July 1942 he gives talk at Green Acre, followed by a series of talks. He was in a Green Acre race Amity meeting in August 1942,and directly after was at a general session at Green Acre. Ober was one among several present in a 1943 series of talks at Green Acre. A 1944 series included Ober and Bostonian Nancy Bowditch and he gave a later series at Portsmouth Baháʼí Center.In 1945 Ober took a trip to Montana where he gave a talk, Ottawa in 1946,and tried to make an impression on Prince Edward Island (without much success). In 1947 he was in Utah giving a talk. He stayed home in the Summer of 1951, and officiated at funeral of Louis G. Gregory, which he followed up with a series of talks at Green Acreas well as other opportunities. For a few years the public mentions of him are a couple funerals he oversaw, but in 1956 he gave a series of talks.In the summer of 1961 a Baháʼí pioneer met Ober who was in a trip in Africa at the time. Some individuals =Nancy Bowditch= Also known as Mrs. Harold Bowditch, (July 4, 1890 – May 1, 1979,) Nancy was the daughter of George de Forest Brush who was active in Dublin, New Hampshire as well as Europe. The Brush family interacted with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the Baháʼís while in Dublin in July and August 1912, especially during an annual out-of-doors play as well as a visit to their farm, but her first husband died unexpectedly in September. Nancy moved from place to place until she married Harvard graduate Dr. Harold Bowditch October 1916. Bowditch became more involved with costume work for theatre productions. While her life was going well she also felt \\"something was wanting in my existence and couldn't put a finger on ... I then began to seek for that missing link, going to most every church and attending various meetings ... (and) hearing of a meeting to be held in Boston about the Baháʼí Faith.\\" > I'll never forget entering the large hall and seeing around me such a > different type of gathering from the usual Boston crowd. Here were both rich > and poor, along with every race. Many were black. I listened to a wonderful > talk on the Faith by Mr. Harry Randall and was so thrilled! Afterwards I > made my way straight to the table where books were being sold in order to > learn more about the subject. I picked out as many as could be comfortably > carried home on the streetcar, then found to my dismay that I didn't have > enough money with which to pay for them! The person at the book stand told > me it was all right to take them home and pay at the next meeting. This may have been an event the Boston Baháʼí community hosted called a \\"World Unity Conference\\" as part of a series sponsored by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of the United States and covered in the Boston Evening Transcript. Randall helped organize and spoke at it. She then credits Randall, Louise Drake Wright and her sister Mrs. George Nelson as aiding her inquiry into the religion while she read books like Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era. She officially joined the religion in 1929. She was visible in the 1930 Race Amity Convention held at Green Acre,and left on Baháʼí pilgrimage in late March 1931 with her then 19 yr. old daughter. They spent three weeks in the area of Haifa and left by way of Jerusalem taking in Christian paths of pilgrimage. She then attended the 1931 national convention reporting on events in Boston as the Chair of the Boston Assembly. She wrote of her pilgrimage in Star of the West in July 1931,and spoke of it in August. She would continue working with the religion with occasional gaps in public mention.<   * In 1948 she was listed as the corresponding secretary of the Baháʼí group of Brookline, Massachusetts, The Bowditch's moved to Peterborough, New Hampshire in the south of the state in 1959, and attended the 1963 Baháʼí World Congress with a granddaughter, and in 1965 Nancy is pictured on the first local Spiritual Assembly. Harold died in August 1964 and their home at 12 Pine Street became the official Baháʼí Center of the community in 1967 at which Guy Murchie gave a talk for the opening ceremony. In 1970 she was at the official presentation of a Baháʼí book to then Governor Walter R. Peterson, Jr. and published a book on her father. 1972 she was noted for a Portsmouth Friends of the Library, spoke at Meriden Connecticut on her memory of meeting ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and aided in costumes for play at Keene State College. =Urbain Ledoux= Urbain J. Ledoux, (August 13, 1874 – April 8, 1941,) later known as \\"Mr. Zero\\", referring to his not wanting his own name to be prominent, was motivated early in his quest of service to humanity. After various stages of a career of service to others he reached the stage of a career diplomat. His approach of advocating for business development as a means to promote the interests of humanity was challenged, that it would be fruitless for higher aims unless personal transformation were brought to bear. He quit the diplomatic service and sought to work with non-governmental organizations for both business and peace interests. Soon he was working with the Baháʼís and present during the conflict over the status of Sarah Farmer as noted above. After that he then began to found institutions seeking to aide humanity, making news first with the unemployment after the First World War among workers and veterans with a breadline in 1919. He advocated for the Baháʼí Faith but was often misunderstood, though he did so with a limited understanding of the principles of the religion and proceeded to set up events aimed at raising awareness of the suffering of the unemployed in New York and Boston. His efforts were seen as too confrontational and his events were repeatedly shut down even when he sought to be less confrontational and have discussions with leaders. The work was renewed with greater intensity during the Great Depression but he was in his 60s already and died soon after. Some of his work and antics were recorded in pictures and newsreels. He died in 1941. = Sadie and Marby Oglesby = African-Americans Sadie (April 10, 1881Ancestry.com. U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007 [database on-line].

May 19, 1945) became interested in the religion in 1913, joined it in 1917, were visible in newspapers giving talks on the religion since the 1920s through most of their lives,• •      * and Sadie went on Baháʼí pilgrimage in March 1927 during which race issues were a prominent part of the conversations and that Sadie should take a more engaged effort towards encouraging whites towards that unity as well as blacks. Sadie was the third black pilgrim, the first black woman, the first black pilgrim to meet Shoghi Effendi as head of the religion. Mabry was a railroad Pullman porter and president of the Boston chapter of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in 1936. Sadie also worked and taught as a nurse.The couple had married in Washington DC in 1901Both were also elected to the Boston Spiritual Assembly over many years where Sadie often served as secretary and occasionally as treasurer. * Louis G. Gregory commented that the Boston Baháʼí community was integrated by 1935 with a large proportion being colored and largely through the work of Sadie. =James Ferdinand Morton= Beginning in 1907 James Ferdinand Morton, (October 18, 1870 – October 7, 1941,) published a series of articles under \\"Fragments of a Mental Autobiography\\" in a journal named Libra which outlines his religious background beginning with Baptist family heritage, goes through Unitarian relatives, and Theosophy exploration, (he was president of the Boston Theosophical Society in 1895) and placing Jesus and the Buddha among those on the highest level of his admiration even if he found fault with all scripture and organized religion. In this period Morton was an avid \\"evangelist\\" atheist, and often spoke out against religion,but he had already encountered the Baháʼí Faith which: > At first, I regarded it with amused interest, as one of many little cults; > but gradually I found myself drawn into closer and closer relation with it. > There was a wideness in its attitude which I had not found elsewhere. It > held place for what was best in Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, > Buddhism, Freethought and all the rest, warring with none of these, but > finding each of them definitely serviceable to the larger spiritual plan of > the universe. It is the great reconciler and harmonizer. I have discovered > in it an abiding-place which I had sought in vain for many restless years. > It increases, rather than decreases, my eagerness to continue the > investigation of truth without bias, and to labor energetically in all > branches of human service. I have no fault to find with the differing > conclusions of other truth-lovers, and am ready to work with them all as > occasion offers. (near 1910) He became a convert to the religion in later life. Morton is visibly in Baháʼí circles from 1915 on the program of presenters at Green Acre. Progress of the local community In 1913 the Boston Baháʼí community rented a room on Huntington Avenue for its weekly public meetings followed in 1914 when it moved to the S.S. Pierce building in Copley Square. In 1917 greater Boston communities were noted sending delegates to the national convention: a combined Beverly-Salem MA delegation (Clarence H. Lunt, Edw. D. Struven), Boston proper (W. H. Randall, A. W. Randall), Cambridge (M. A. Doer), Dublin, NH (Frank A. Chant, Leona St. C Barnitz), Eliot, ME (Kate C. Ives), and Worcester, MA (Howard Stuven, Helen C Greene). News of the survival of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá near the end of World War I made the Boston Post, October 1918. In 1919 the Boston Baháʼí community rented a twelve-room house at 120 Charles St. which continued in early 1920.In July a meeting was held at Hotel Victoria. Baháʼí pilgrims returning by the end of the year were noted in the Boston Post included Mrs. C H Cooper., H. S. Goodall, and A. J. Frankland. By early 1921 a more sustained series of meetings are held at Chauncy Hall at 585 Boylston St, (former home of local suffrage meetings,) Sunday evenings.    And there was December coverage of the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in neighboring Fritchburg. In 1926 the Boston Baháʼí community hosted a \\"World Unity Conference\\" as noted above where Nancy Bowditch learned of the religion. The first day long meeting was held at Steinert Hall, the second at the Second Unitarian Church, and third at the Church of the Redemption where Randall chaired the day. In 1939 Louise Erickson took a trip around New England promoting the religion. In 1940 the Local Spiritual Assembly of Boston was incorporated, and the community held its own \\"Race Unity Day\\" in 1945. In 1950 the Boston Baháʼí Center was established at 116 Commonwealth Avenue and a regional conference was held August 1951 in Fritchburg with Baháʼís from the region and beyond. In March/April 1952 the Baháʼí Spiritual Assembly of Boston was interviewed for the show \\"Our Believing World\\" on station WBZ-TV. =Guy Murchie= Guy Murchie (Jr.), (25 January 1907 - 8 July 1997,) the son of Ethel A. and Guy Murchie Sr. Sr Murchie was close to President Theodore Roosevelt such that while sitting as president Theodore Roosevelt and his wife attended Guy Jr.'s christening. Guy Jr was raised as an Episcopalian, attended Kent School, which at the time was just \\"for Boys\\", graduated from Harvard in 1929. Murchie's interest in the Baháʼí Faith began when he was tasked with writing an article about the Baháʼí House of Worship at Wilmette, Illinois around 1938, note the article referred to in the Kent State newspaper is not yet online - see and then officially joined the religion 1939. He had been impressed with the unique qualities of the temple being a blend of east and west styles, and extended his interest when his insights of the biological unity of humanity was raised to a spiritual affirmation. In 1946 Murchie and then wife Barbara Cooney moved to Pepperell, Massachusetts and worked with the high school.  though Cooney and Murchie divorced in 1947. In 1954 Murchie toured Iran visiting several sites holy to Baháʼís.continued * continued * continued * continued Diary notes of his travels became the basis of a series of articles in the 1960s and later. But starting in 1955 he began to be more public with his choice of religion  several news stories in the wider media noted it which were closely followed by Baháʼís. * However it wasn't until the passing of his father in 1958 that he became even more public - not least was his own public statement in 1958 in the Chicago Tribune \\"I am a Baháʼí\\". Increasing recognition In 1960 Hand of the Cause, a prominent and renowned Baháʼí, Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum visited the Boston Baháʼí community and offered several talks during her visit. The Harvard Crimson's first article noting the religion seems to have been concerning the Baháʼí persecution in Morocco, followed by notice of Harvard Baháʼís attending the first Baháʼí World Congress, both in 1963, including Sam McClellan, nephew of Albert Vail. In 1965 the first assembly is noted in Fitchburg. In 1966 another regional conference held. In 1967 the Boston Baháʼís move their Center to 40 St. Botolph Street. Boston College had a class on the religion circa 1968. Quiet since 1963, the Harvard Crimson's next mention of the religion was in 1970. It was followed up in 1971 and 1973. A number of Portsmouth New Hampshire Baháʼís - Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Milden with children Steve and Laugel, Elizabeth Frazier and Ruth Silva - left to attend a conference of Baháʼís in South Carolina in Spring 1970 right at the beginning of a period of intense growth of the religion there. Local Unitarian Universalist held a meeting on the religion in 1971 and Dwight W. Allen, then of the University of Massachusetts School of Education, was among speakers on the religion. In 1974 local 'Old Ipswich Days' fair of Ipswich, Massachusetts had Baháʼí participants, while Baháʼís Seals and Crofts played at the Boston Music Hall in March. In 1977 the Boston Baháʼí Center established a lending library as well as regular programming for children and collective activities to promote awareness of the religion. Circa 1983 the Harvard-Radcliffe Baháʼí Association (college club) was noted having 12 members. The club was more profiled in 1987. In 1986 the city council of Cambridge and Mayor released a proclamation recommending that the whole city read and take to heart: The Promise of World Peace, written by the Universal House of Justice, then and current head of the religion. An article also ran in The Heights profiling a college student from Iran at Boston College, and a campus meeting about the religion. In 1988 the national assembly of the United States picked Boston among its four foci for expansion of the religion and a conference of some 800 Baháʼís gathered. In 1990 the Boston Baháʼís move their Center to 495 Columbus Avenue and it is moved again in 1993 to its current location at 595 Albany Street. Modern community In the 1990s Baháʼís were occasionally noted commenting on things at Harvard.before again being profiled about the persecution in Iran. In 2002 Baháʼí words were included in a 9-11 commemoration on campus. One student who had converted in high school during a year abroad in the Czech Republic was profiled at Harvard in 2004. In 2005 the Baha'i association co-sponsored \\"Belief in Action\\", a day devoted to service projects. and supported interfaith discussions. Without referencing the Baháʼí club, the campus groups turned out for support of a \\"free Iran\\" in 2006. and noted Baháʼí Institute for Higher Education related issues. Baháʼís were noted as Abrahamic in 2006. The club was again profiled in 2007 when it was only six members and two over seas though it still supported interfaith events.Rainn Wilson's support of BIHE related events was then noted on campus. From 1996 to the present the Greater Boston Baháʼí community adopted a systematic approach to grassroots community development taking root in Baháʼí communities all over the world, based around four core activities: study circles, children's classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings. In 2008 the Boston Baháʼí community participated in the Stamford, Connecticut regional conferences convened by the Universal House of Justice. Boston University and MIT were among the cities of a campaign about the barriers to college education, to which BIHE was a response, in Iran in 2011-2012. A youth regional conference was also held in 2013. The reformed Race Amity Convention system was re-established by the National Center for Race Amity starting in 2010, which helped establish the Masschusettes observance of Race Amity Day in 2015, and its continued observance, as well as a nationally telecast documentary on positive race relations, An American story : Race Amity and the other tradition and another project of conferences in Tennessee, Texas, and Georgia, and a youtube channel. Demographics There is no county approaching 1% Baháʼís in the region but there are more Baháʼís per capita in southern New Hampshire, less in Massachusetts, and least in Rhode Island. Within that broad pattern there are significant variations - counties where the county level per capita count of Baháʼís is several times above or below the average. In Franklin County, Massachusetts and Hampshire County, Massachusetts there are 5x higher concentration of Baháʼís than that state's average, and down to Bristol County, Massachusetts and Plymouth County, Massachusetts at about half the average. On one end of the greater area, for Rhode Island, per capita Baháʼí counts range from a bit above Rhode Island average in Newport, Rhode Island, to a low in Bristol County, Rhode Island at half that state's average. And on the other end of the greater area in southern New Hampshire, per capita Baháʼí counts range from a high in Belknap County, New Hampshire to a low of near a third of that in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. In Massachusetts, in addition to Boston, today there are Local Spiritual Assemblies, the local administrative body, in Brookline, Cambridge, Malden, Medford, Newton, Somerville, Waltham, and Watertown.

About wide, it connects the Natal Valley and Transkei Basin in the north to the Agulhas Basin in the south and is the only near-shore connection between the south-western Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean. Geology The formation of the Agulhas Passage was initiated by the Gondwana break-up some (Ma) and the rifting of the Somali and Mozambique Basins, an event associated with the formation of the ocean floor in the Weddell Sea 147 Ma. Between the Agulhas Bank and the Agulhas Passage the boundary between the Earth's crust and the mantle (the Moho) ascend from over which is normal for a continent-ocean boundary. The crustal thickness under the Agulhas Passage varies from which is equally normal for oceanic crust. It is possible, however, that volcanic flows from the Agulhas Plateau large igneous province (LIP) added crustal material to the Agulhas Passage (which is 160-120 Ma) during the LIP formation (100-80 Ma) and that the crust under the passage was originally thinner. The sedimentary layers are very thin in the western Agulhas Passage, in places only . In the central parts of the passage, in contrast, they can reach and form sediment drifts. The southern part is affected by thinning and erosion. Oceanography The Agulhas Current, the western boundary current of the Indian Ocean, flows south through the Natal Valley, Transkei Basin, and Agulhas Passage into the south-east Atlantic Ocean where it retroflects back into the Indian Ocean as the Agulhas Return Current. In the Indian Ocean, the Agulhas Current is dissipated into a gyre which finally brings parts of the water mass back to the Natal Valley. Since the development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Oligocene, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) flows both north through the Agulhas Passage and south of the Agulhas Plateau into the Transkei Basin and then into the Mozambique Basin. North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) flows north through the Agulhas Passage and then west of the Mozambique Ridge and through the Transkei Basin east of the ridge and then into the Indian Ocean. South of South Africa NADW is found close to a depth of where it transports 2.9 Sverdrups (million m³/s) at a speed of , resulting in an Agulhas Passage depleted of sediments at this level.

Biography In 1759 Georg Wolff moved to London and worked as an assistant for Jens Pedersen, the owner of a timber export business. The company was part of a small Danish-Norwegian community centered on Wellclose Square in London. Most residents were involved in the export of Norwegian timber to London, a trade following the Great Fire of London in 1666. In 1760 Wolff married Elizabeth Gorham, an 18-year-old woman from the English parish of St Neots. They had two daughters; Elizabeth (who married John Dorville) and Martha Ann, as well as one son, Jens. In June 1770 the elder Elizabeth died. Wolff later married Sarah Cheesement, who bore him two additional daughters, Sarah Augusta, and Inger Maria. Following Sarah's death in 1790, Wolff never remarried. In 1767 Georg was joined in London by his brother, Ernst Wolff. Together they established Geo. & Ernst Wolff. In 1792 Georg Wolff's son-in-law John Dorville became a partner and the firm name was changed to Wolffs & Dorville. The firm of Wolffs & Dorville flourished until it went bankrupt in 1812 largely due to the British war with Denmark. In 1787 Wolff was appointed the Danish Consul in London. The Danish consulate in London was responsible for Danish-Norwegian interests throughout the southern coasts of England, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. All Danish-Norwegian ships arriving in London were required to report information concerning their cargo and journey to the consulate, placing Georg Wolff and his firm at the center of the northern timber trade. Upon Britain's entry into the War of the First Coalition in 1793, the Royal Navy began taking Danish ships as prize ships. In 1804, Georg Wolff's son, Jens Wollf was appointed Adjunct Consul and spent most of his time assisting Danish captains whose ships had been captured. Though few timber shipments from Norway were taken as prizes of war, in total nearly 1,000 Danish and Norwegian ships were sized by the British between 1793 and 1807. Jens Wolff served as acting consul until the closing of the consulate in 1807 following the Bombardment of Copenhagen. Wolff died in 1828. He and his wife Elizabeth were buried at the Danish Church in Wellclose Square.

Bred in Hampshire and trained in Yorkshire he was a natural front-runner who was best at distances of around one mile. As a two- year-old he showed very good form, recording victories in the Acomb Stakes in England and the Futurity Stakes in Ireland. In the following year he was narrowly beaten in the 2000 Guineas before defeating very strong field in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. He then finished second in the Eclipse Stakes but was well beaten in his last eight races. He was retired at the end of the 1997 season and stood with little success as a breeding stallion in England, New Zealand and Turkey. Background Bijou d'Inde was a chestnut horse with a white star bred in England by the Hampshire-based Whitsbury Manor Stud. His sire, Cadeaux Genereux won several major sprint races including the Nunthorpe Stakes and the July Cup. At stud he sired over 1,000 winners including Bahamian Bounty, Embassy, Touch of the Blues (Atto Mile) and Toylsome (Prix de la Forêt). Bijou d'Inde's dam Pushkar produced several other winners including Eradicate and Hebridean (Long Walk Hurdle). In October 1994, the yearling was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought by the trainer Mark Johnston. During his racing career, Bijou d'Inde was owned by Stuart Morrison and trained by Johnston in Middleham, North Yorkshire. Johnston was initially unimpressed by the appearance of the \\"gawky\\" chestnut, later commenting \\"I would have given him back if I could. But the first day he stepped on to the gallops he was very, very good\\". Racing career 1995: two-year-old season On his first appearance, Bijou d'Inde contested a six furlong maiden race at Newcastle Racecourse on 30 June and finished second, beaten a head by the favourite Mazeed. Four weeks later he ran in a similar event at Goodwood and was beaten a neck by the Peter Chapple- Hyam-trained Woodborough. Despite his two defeats, the colt was then moved up in class and was made the 11/4 second favourite for the Acomb Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse on 15 August. Ridden by Darryll Holland, he led from the start before accelerating away from his opponents in the last quarter mile to win by three and a half lengths from Hammerstein. In all of his subsequent races the colt was ridden by Jason Weaver. Bijou d'Inde was sent to Ireland for his next race and stated odds-on favourite for the Group Three Futurity Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 1 September. He disputed the lead with the Jim Bolger-trained Ceirseach before taking a clear advantage three furlongs out and won \\"very easily\\" by two and a half lengths from the other British challenger Axford. Three weeks later, on his final appearance as a juvenile, Bijou d'Inde started second favourite for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. After being retrained by Weaver in the early stages he reached third place in the straight before fading and finishing fifth behind the Luca Cumani-trained Mons. 1996: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut, Bijou d'Inde was one of thirteen colts to contest the 187th running of the classic 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and started at odds of 14/1. The field was a strong one, with Alhaarth heading the betting from Beauchamp King (Racing Post Trophy), Storm Trooper (Feilden Stakes), Royal Applause, Mark of Esteem and Danehill Dancer. Bijou d'Inde was among the leaders from the start and went to the front three furlongs out before engaging in a prolonged, three-way struggle with Mark of Esteem and the 40/1 outsider Even Top. In the ensuing photo- finish, Bijou d'Inde was placed third, beaten a head and a neck, with the trio finishing six lengths clear of Alhaarth in fourth. Three weeks later the colt started 3/1 second favourite behind the French-trained Spinning World in the Irish 2,000 Guineas on soft ground at the Curragh. After taking the lead in the straight he weakened in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Spinning World, Rainbow Blues and Beauchamp King, beaten six lengths by the winner. Johnston had admitted before the race that he had been uncertain about how the colt would cope with the conditions. On 18 June at Royal Ascot Bijou d'Inde ran in the 151st edition of the St James's Palace Stakes. The Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Ashkalani started 13/8 favourite ahead of Spinning World and Mark of Esteem with Bijou d'Inde next in the betting on 9/1. The other runners included Beuachamp King, Cayman Kai (Flying Childers Stakes, European Free Handicap) and the Godolphin challenger Wall Street. Bijou d'Inde took the lead after the first two furlongs and maintained his advantage into the straight when Ashkalani emerged as his main challenger. The French colt took the lead and went half a length up, but Bijou d'Inde rallied to overtake his opponent in the final strides and won by a head with the outsider Sorbie Tower taking third. Bijou d'Inde was moved up in distance for his next two starts, beginning with the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 2 July in which he faced older horses for the first time. He was among the leaders from the start and finished second, beaten a neck by the five-year-old Halling. In the International Stakes at York in August he finished third to Halling and First Island beaten four and a half lengths by the winner. The colt was back to a mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in September, but after leading for six furlongs he faded to finish sixth of the seven runners behind Mark of Esteem. 1997: four-year-old season In the early part of 1997 Bijou d'Inde was sent to race in Dubai and ran twice on the dirt at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. He finished last of the four runners in a race on 9 March and then in the Dubai World Cup on 3 April. He was towards the rear of the field approaching the final turn when he was brought down by the fall of the Japanese challenger Hokuto Vega. Bijou d'Inde returned to racing in Europe in autumn but never recaptured his best form. In September he finished eighth of nine behind Spinning World in the Prix du Moulin and fifth behind Air Express in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. In the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs in October he finished last of seven behind Pilsudski. In December he was sent to Hong Kong and finished tailed-off last of the fourteen runners in the Hong Kong Cup. Stud record Bijou d'Inde was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion and was shuttled between the Woodland Stud at Newmarket and the Glenmorgan Stud in New Zealand. In 2000 he was sold and exported to stand at the Turkish National Stud near İzmit. He sired no winners of any consequence and died in Turkey at the stables of the Turkish Jockey Club on 19 June 2010.

Crane has also been a member of Sussex Cricket League club Worthing Cricket Club since the age of 10, playing for the club's junior teams and also claiming 54 wickets for the Worthing CC 1st XI. Crane's good performance in the academy and guidance from Maru and Hampshire academy spin coach Darren Flint earned him a call-up to the England U17 development team. In the summer of 2014 Crane's continued good performances made him a regular in the Hampshire 2nd XI and earned him a call-up to the England U19s for the tour of Dubai and later the teams tour of Australia to play the Australia U19s. Crane was also called up to the first team squad for their trip to Worcestershire in the LV County Championship.

His father, Charles Bothuell IV, and stepmother, Monique Dillard-Bothuell, were charged with torture and child abuse. In 2016, Bothuell IV pleaded guilty to fourth-degree child abuse after accepting a plea deal.  History  In early 2014, Bothuell IV and Dillard-Bothuell reported their son, Bothuell V, missing. Eleven days after they filed the missing persons report, Bothuell V was found in the family's basement, behind boxes. Bothuell IV learned of the discovery of his son on live television while being interviewed by Nancy Grace, which became a viral video on YouTube. In April 2015, the couple were arrested and charged with torture and second-degree child abuse. The torture charge, which, if proven, could have resulted in life sentences, was later dismissed by the court. Trial and aftermath On January 19, 2016, the case was resolved when Bothuell IV pleaded guilty to fourth-degree child abuse in exchange for removal of the second-degree child-abuse charges. The prosecutors revealed that Bothuell V was very thin and had marks on his body from the abuse when he was found after being reported missing. Bothuell V testified that he was kept home from school and forced to engage in rigorous exercise routines daily by his parents, in addition to his allegations of being beaten. Bothuell IV also admitted to beating his son with a PVC pipe. He was sentenced to 18 months of probation and mandatory anger management classes. He also lost custody of his son, and was ordered to have no further contact with him. Dillard-Bothuell reportedly accepted a plea deal earlier as well, but the details of this were not made public. It was also reported that her record would be cleared after six months if she stayed out of legal trouble.

Notes on the Hymns and Biographies of the Authors and Composers (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980). – 10 February 1831) was an Irish pianist, composer, and music publisher – probably the earliest classical composer from Ireland to emigrate to the United States. Life Moran was probably born in Dublin and studied with Philip Dwyer (died 1802) and Philip Cogan (1750–1833).Ita M. Hogan: Anglo- Irish Music, 1780–1830 (Cork: Cork University Press, 1966), p. 204.

A Calendar of Performances vol. 6 (Lanham, MD: Lehigh University Press, 2011). His earliest compositions were published in Dublin from c.1796 and reprinted there until the late 1820s.Online catalogue of the National Library of Ireland, http://catalogue.nli.ie. In 1817, Moran emigrated to the USA with his wife, a singer. While Kinkeldey described him as a \\"Boston musician\\",In his foreword to H. Earle Johnson: Musical Interludes in Boston, 1795–1830 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1943), p. xi. the Moran couple was evidently very active in New York's concert life, even their daughter making her début as a singer and pianist in 1820, aged five.J. Bunker Clark, Eve R. Meyer: \\"Moran, Peter K.\\", in: The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013). Moran was organist at Grace Episcopal Church (c.1823–7), and St John's Chapel (1828–31), performed for the Handel and Haydn Society in 1820 and for the New York Choral Society's first concert in 1824. He also played the cello in the García Opera Company in New York in 1825, performed with the Philharmonic Society, and was concertmaster of the Musical Fund Society. From 1822 to 1823 he ran a piano and music store and published about 25 pieces, including 16 of his own compositions and arrangements. Some of his Dublin-published music was reissued in New York, where he was second only to James Hewitt as the city's most prolific composer of piano music.Clark/Meyer (2013), as above. Moran died in New York City. Music Moran evidently was an able pianist, judging from the scores of his piano music. He made a name for himself with rondos and variations on original or popular tunes. Several of his works were expressly written \\"for harp or piano-forte\\", suggesting that he played the harp as well. After his emigration he also became popular as a song composer, with The Carrier Pigeon (1822; also arranged as a rondo for piano, c.1825) that had many editions. Other well- known pieces by him (for harp or piano) include his variations on Kinlock of Kinlock (1825), Swiss Waltz (c.1810), Stantz Waltz (c.1817), and Suabian Air (c.1817). He also arranged many traditional airs, and religious works by Handel and others. Many of Moran's works were still listed as for sale in the Board of Music Trade Catalogue in 1870.J.

The law gives prosecutors the power to extrajudicially declare foreign and international organizations \\"undesirable\\" in Russia and shut them down. Organizations that do not disband when given notice to do so, as well as Russians who maintain ties to them, are subject to high fines and significant jail time. Critics say the terms are unclear and lead to dangerous precedent. Supporters of the bill reference organizations that have become actively involved in supporting political dissent.  Implications for NGOs  Under the law, Russian prosecutors are able to target foreign groups which they deem to present \\"a threat to the foundation of the constitutional order of the Russian Federation, the defense capability of the country or the security of the state.\\" Groups designated undesirable are forbidden from holding public events and from possessing or distributing promotional materials, including via mass media. All Russian banks and financial institutions are forbidden from cooperating with such organizations and are required to inform Russia's financial watchdog agency about any such organizations that attempt to contact them. Given a notice from the prosecutors, such organizations have to disband. Violators face fines or prison terms of up to six years. People cooperating with such entities are subject to fines and can be banned from entering Russia. Russians who maintain ties with \\"undesirables\\" face penalties ranging from fines to a maximum of six years in prison. Duma deputy Aleksandr Tarnavsky, one of the legislation's coauthors, stated that \\"I do not think that there is a particular company that has to fall under this list. But if a company suddenly starts causing a lot of trouble, starts acting arrogantly and impudently, then in theory it could fall under the list of undesirable organizations.\\"  Enforcement  On 25 May 2015, a first proposal of undesirable NGOs to the General Prosecutor's office was made by a parliamentarian from LDPR. The list included the think tank Carnegie Moscow Center, the international history and human rights society Memorial, as well as the Moscow offices of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. On 7 July 2015, RIA Novosti published an alleged shortlist by the Federal Council of Russia of organizations to be branded undesirable. Those include the US-based Open Society Institute, the National Endowment for Democracy, the MacArthur Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. The list also includes the Polish-based Education for Democracy foundation and the East European Democratic Centre as well as three Ukrainian organizations: The Ukrainian World Congress, the Ukrainian World Coordinating Council and the Crimean Field Mission on Human Rights. After the Federal Council's vote to include it on the recommended list of \\"undesirable organizations\\", the MacArthur Foundation announced the closing of its Russian division, operating since 1992. In July 2015, the National Endowment for Democracy became the first organization to be officially blacklisted by the Russian authorities under the law. The decision by the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation was announced on its website in which it claimed that NED's activities \\"pose a threat to constitutional order of the Russian Federation, defense potential and security of the state\\". Among NED's alleged infractions were its donations to commercial and non-profit organizations that independently monitor elections, as well as for undefined \\"political activities\\" and \\"discrediting service in the [Russian] armed forces\\". In November 2015, two branches of George Soros' charity network, the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation, were banned under the law in Russia. The infractions were not listed, but the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation released a statement stating that \\"the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\\". Ahead of the March 2018 presidential election, two European organizations involved in election monitoring were added.  Targeted NGOs  The registry of \\"undesirable organizations\\" includes the following organizationsПеречень иностранных и международных неправительственных организаций, деятельность которых признана нежелательной на территории Российской Федерации: * National Endowment for Democracy (July 27, 2015); * OSI Assistance Foundation and Open Society Foundation (December 1, 2015); * U.S. Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (December 7, 2015); * National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (May 17, 2016). * International Republican Institute (16 August 2016); * Media Development Investment Fund (16 August 2016). * Open Russia (United Kingdom) (April 2017); * Institute of Modern Russia (United States) (April 2017); * Open Russia Civic Movement (April 2017); * European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE) (13 March 2018); * International Elections Study Center (IESC) (13 March 2018) * Atlantic Council (25 July 2019)Генпрокуратура России признала Атлантический совет «нежелательной организацией»Генеральная прокуратура Российской Федерации приняла решение о признании нежелательной на территории Российской Федерации деятельности иностранной неправительственной организации * Člověk v tísni (13 November 2019)Минюст РФ внес в список \\"нежелательных\\" чешскую организацию \\"Человек в беде\\", работавшую в зонах военных конфликтов  Reactions  Russia's human rights ombudsman Ella Pamfilova said the power given to the Prosecutor General to tag groups \\"undesirable\\" without going to court contradicts the Russian constitution and condemned the lack of a right to appeal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said that the law was an attempt to further isolate and discredit members of civil society who were critical of the government. Britain's Minister for Europe, David Lidington, said it was \\"yet another example of the Russian authorities' harassment of NGOs and those who work with them in Russia\\". The US State Department stated it was \\"deeply troubled\\" by the law and expressed concern that it \\"will further restrict the work of civil society in Russia and is a further example of the Russian government's growing crackdown on independent voices and intentional steps to isolate the Russian people from the world\\". The Deputy Chief of the US Mission to the OSCE Permanent Council urged the Russian government \\"to uphold its international obligations and OSCE commitments to respect the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association, and the rule of law.\\" Amnesty International said the bill would \\"squeeze the life\\" from civil society, while Human Rights Watch warned it would be locals who would be worst-hit.

The soundtrack album was launched on 26 May 2015 in Bangalore by the D-Beats company. The album consists of five tracks. Track listing  Critical reception  The reviewer for Ytalkies.com reviewed the album and wrote, \\"The tracks are quite simple for Sharan’s film\\", considering that each of his hitherto recent films had a minimum of one hit number. The reviewer felt the title track \\"Bullet Basya\\" was the best of all the tracks and wrote, \\"Arjun Janya’s musical creativity, Raghu Niduvalli’s smart- talk lyrics and of course Tippu’s robust voice in the song would get this a number 1 spot in the album.\\"  Release and reception  The film was given the \\"U/A\\" (Parental Guidance) certificate by the Regional Censor Board and without any cuts. The makers looked at a June 2015 release. However, with over 300 theatres screening Ranna and Vajrakaya, its release was delayed. Anticipating \\"stiff competition\\" from the Telugu film Baahubali: The Beginning which saw a 10 July release, Bullet Basya was released on 24 July. Upon theatrical release, the film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. The audiences felt the film had a \\"story with no freshness in the presentation.\\" Critics, calling the film a \\"sex comedy\\", echoed the same views and felt that \\"it had nothing new to offer\\" and added that it was filled with dialogues and songs with double entendre. A. Sharadhaa of The New Indian Express called the film \\"a thorough entertainer (laced with innuendo).\\" She paid credit to the performances of all the actors, and the cinematography and music. Archana Nathan of The Hindu called the film \\"An overdose of masculinity\\" and wrote, \\"The film is guilty of not just weak writing but also a poor cinematic imagination.\\" Reviewing the film for Deccan Herald, S. Viswanath wrote, \\"[The film] is a stereotypical, stock-in-trade Sharan comedy\\" and added that \\"it would be futile to look for logic.\\" Writing for Bangalore Mirror, Shyam Prasad S. called the a \\"Timepass nonsense\\" and wrote, \\"Though they are well-shot and visually good, they fail to add any weight to the film. The cinematography and editing are neat and there is no baggage or drag. The film is silly and is gracious enough not to take itself seriously.\\" Sunayana Suresh of The Times of India rated the film 2.5/5 and called it a \\"senseless and sexist comedy\\" and wrote that \\"there is nothing new in the script.\\" She further wrote, \\"The comic ensemble including Yathiraj, Anand, Rangayana Raghu and Sadhu Kokila, do their bit. The cinematography and art direction is commendable, while the music, unlike other Sharan films, doesn't have the zing\\". Shashiprasad S. M. of Deccan Chronicle too rated the film 2.5/5 and wrote, \\"With no soul in the subject, the director has decorated the body (script) with lots of jewellery which pretends to shine, but has no real spark in it!\\" On Haripriya's performance, he wrote, \\"[She] grabs and hold attention of audience from her entry until climax.\\" He concluded writing, \\"[The film] is more noisy and less fun.\\" References External links * 2015 films 2015 comedy films 2010s Kannada-language films Indian comedy films Kannada-language films Indian films Films scored by Arjun Janya Films directed by Jayatheertha ","title":"Bullet Basya"},{"id":"47211737","text":"M.

Between 1999 and 2002, he served as the Leader of the Democrat Turkey Party, but did not contest any elections. With a history in the Turkish political right, Sezgin had actively participated in the historical Democrat Party led by Adnan Menderes until the 1960 coup d'état. Entering Parliament as a Member of Parliament for Aydın in the 1961 general election, he served continuously as an MP until the 1980 coup d'état, after which he was re-elected in the 1991 general election. He lost his seat in the 1999 general election and retired from active politics in 2002. He was also active in sport, having served as the 15th Chairman of Gençlerbirliği S.K. between 1967 and 1968. Early life and career İsmet Sezgin was born in 1928, in Aydın as the eldest of 9 children. He completed his primary and secondary education in Aydın and graduated from high school in İzmir. He received higher education at the High Economy and Trade School (now Dokuz Eylül University). During his student years, he was involved in athletics. After graduating from the High Economy and Trade School in 1950, he immediately began working at the Turkey Real Estate Credit Bank (now Ziraat Bankası) Denizli branch. He married Saadet Sezgin, a mathematics teacher in 1952 and was also elected to the Democrat Party Denizli Provincial Administration Board in the same year. Political career Mayor of Aydın Sezgin was elected as the Mayor of Aydın in the 1955 local elections from the Democrat Party. He was removed from office as a result of the 1960 coup d'état, during which the Democrat Party government led by Adnan Menderes was ousted from power. As a member of the Democrats, Sezgin was briefly arrested after being removed from office. Justice Party After being freed, Sezgin established the provincial office of the new Justice Party (AP), which was seen as the successor to the Democrat Party. In the 1961 general election, he was elected as an AP Member of Parliament for Aydın. In 1963, he became the President of the Turkish Municipal Association, serving until 1985. In 1967, he became the Chairman of Gençlerbirliği S.K. and served until 1968. In 1968, he was made a Deputy Leader of the Justice Party. Minister of Youth and Sports After the Justice Party won a parliamentary majority in the 1969 general election, Justice Party leader and Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel established the Ministry of Youth and Sports and appointed İsmet Sezgin as Turkey's first Minister of Youth and Sports in his government. Although Demirel briefly resigned after his party MPs rebelled against the government's budget proposals, Sezgin continued as Youth and Sports Minister in the 32nd government of Turkey, which was also formed by Demirel. Sezgin was removed from office, as was the rest of the government, following the 1971 Turkish coup d'état. Minister of Finance Although the Republican People's Party (CHP) was the largest party in Parliament, a poor performance in by-election resulted in the CHP government resigning. Süleyman Demirel was once again tasked with the formation of a new government and eventually formed the 43rd government of Turkey with outside support from the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP). The government was formed entirely by Justice Party MPs, with Sezgin becoming the Minister of Finance. Due to the parliamentary deadlock resulting from a failed attempt to elect a new President in 1980, the government was ousted from power by the 1980 Turkish coup d'état led by General Kenan Evren. Parliament was abolished and Sezgin was banned, along with many other politicians, from running for political office. Minister of the Interior With his political ban lifted as a result of the 1987 constitutional referendum, Sezgin returned to Parliament as an MP from Aydın in the 1991 general election, this time from the True Path Party (DYP). The DYP had also been formed by Demirel after having his political ban lifted and was seen as a successor to the disbanded Justice Party. Having secured a plurality in the 1991 election, the DYP formed a coalition government with the Social Democratic Populist Party led by Erdal İnönü. In this government, Sezgin was appointed Minister of the Interior. Speaker of the Parliament After President Turgut Özal's death in 1993, Demirel was subsequently elected as the 9th President of Turkey in the 1993 presidential election. In the subsequent leadership election, Sezgin put his name forward as a candidate but withdrew in the second round of the election. After Tansu Çiller was elected as the leader of the DYP, Sezgin resigned as Interior Minister. In 1995, he was elected as the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly, succeeding Hüsamettin Cindoruk. He served in this position until the 1995 general election, in which the DYP lost 43 seats. Minister of National Defense and Deputy Prime Minister After the DYP formed a coalition government with the Islamist Welfare Party (RP) in 1996, Sezgin resigned from the DYP in protest and was one of the founding members of the new Democrat Turkey Party (DTP). The 'Refahyol' government (DYP-RP coalition) collapsed in 1997 after a military memorandum. Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yılmaz was tasked with forming a new government and managed to form a minority triple-party coalition between ANAP, the DTP and the Democratic Left Party (DSP). The DTP leader Hüsamettin Cindoruk did not participate in the government, so Sezgin became Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey as the most senior DTP representative in the coalition government, serving alongside the DSP leader Bülent Ecevit. Sezgin concurrently served as the Minister of National Defense. The government collapsed following the Türkbank scandal, after which the Republican People's Party (CHP) decided to end its outside support for the government. Leader of the DTP In the 1999 general election, the DTP won just 0.58% of the vote, falling far below the 10% election threshold necessary to win parliamentary representation. Sezgin, as well as all other DTP MPs, lost their seats in Parliament. As a result, Hüsamettin Cindoruk resigned as party leader. Sezgin was subsequently elected as the DTP leader in place of Cindoruk, but resigned in May 2002 without contesting any elections as party leader. He announced that he was retiring from active politics. The DTP contested the 2002 general election under an electoral alliance with the DYP, but the two parties combined still failed to pass the 10% boundary. Personal life İsmet Sezgin married mathematics teacher Saadet (Sezgin) in 1952; she died in 2004. They had two daughters, Seynan Levent and Ayşe. Sezgin died of multiple organ failure on 7 December 2016, aged 88. Legacy and recognition In the Bornova district of İzmir, there is a primary school named after Sezgin.

Prior to founding the company, Ewing worked in the insurance business. The choice of name has been assessed as deceptive by later commentators. Businessman W. Baer Ewing had hired tractor designer Robert Kinkaid to develop his product line, but named the company after one Paul Ford, a local hardware clerk Ewing had hired, allegedly to leverage the Ford name to take advantage of customer confusion with Henry Ford. The company may have hoped for a quick settlement with Henry Ford to acquire the name, but instead Henry Ford marketed his own line of tractors, beginning in 1916, under the brand name Fordson.

Mathematical Biology: an introduction. third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002. It was first presented by Anderson Gray McKendrick in 1926 as a deterministic limit of lattice models applied to epidemiology, and subsequently independently in 1959 by biophysics professor Heinz von Foerster for describing cell cycles. Mathematical formula The mathematical formula can be derived from first principles. It reads: :frac{partial n}{partial t} + frac{partial n}{partial a} = - m(a)n where the population density n(t,a) is a function of age a and time t, and m(a) is the death function. When m(a) = 0, we have: :frac{partial n}{partial t} = - frac{partial n}{partial a} It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.  Derivation  Suppose that for a change in time dt and change in age da, the population density is:n(t+dt,a + da) = [1-m(a)dt]n(t,a)That is, during a time period dt the population density decreases by a percentage m(a)dt. Taking a Taylor series expansion to order dt gives us that:n(t+dt,a + da) approx n(t,a) + {partial nover{partial t}}dt + {partial nover{partial a}}daWe know that da/dt = 1, since the change of age with time is 1. Therefore, after collecting terms, we must have that:{partial nover{partial t}} + {partial nover{partial a}} = -m(a)n Analytical solution The von Foerster equation is a transport equation; it can be solved using a characteristics method. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences. To get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added: : n(t,0)= int_0^infty b (a)n(t,a) , da which states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation for otherwise), and that: : n(0,a)= f(a) which states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation. Similar equations In Sebastian Aniţa, Viorel Arnăutu, Vincenzo Capasso. An Introduction to Optimal Control Problems in Life Sciences and Economics (Birkhäuser. 2011), this equation appears as a special case of the Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation; in the latter there is inflow, and the math is based on directional derivative. The McKendrick’s equation appears extensively in the context of cell biology as a good approach to model the eukaryotic cell cycle .

Early life \\"Born in barracks\\" in 1965, his father was a warrant officer in the Royal Ulster Rifles a regiment of the British Army. The family settled in Portadown, County Armagh, in Northern Ireland when he was 10 following the cessation of his father's regular service. The family moved into a house in Union Street, situated in the densely populated Edgarstown area on the outskirts of the town centre. Beattie's mother died young, leaving his father (who had by this time enlisted with the Ulster Defence Regiment) to bring him and two brothers up. At the age of 15 he accidentally shot a friend when the two of them discovered Beattie Snr's personal protection weapon and were playing with it. Although shot in the head, his friend recovered. Military career At the age of 16 in 1982, Beattie joined the Royal Irish Rangers and following training was posted to the 2nd Battalion who were stationed in Wavell Barracks, Berlin. In over 28 years of service rose to the rank of regimental sergeant major. During that time he served in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Northern Ireland being awarded the General Officer NI commendation, the Queen's Commendation for Bravery and the NATO Meritorious Service Medal. He was commissioned from the ranks in 2005, gaining promotion to captain. As part of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team, Captain Beattie was part of an operation intended to retake the town of Garmsir in Helmand Province. As a result of his actions during the intense fighting over a number of days, he was recommended for, and subsequently awarded, the Military Cross. Following his return from Afghanistan, Beattie published the first of two books, An Ordinary Soldier, which became an immediate best seller in the United Kingdom and propelled him into the public eye.. The Sunday Times said of the book: \\"... this compelling memoir of an army life… a riveting read…One of the strengths of the book is Beattie’s description of working with the Afghans.\\" The Daily Mail said that \\"Of the battalion of courageous tales to emerge from the Iraq and Afghan conflicts, this extraordinary account of an 'ordinary soldier' is one of the finest.\\" Beattie's follow-up book was Task Force Helmand which the Daily Telegraph described as thoughtful and compassionate. Political career After retiring from the army, Beattie joined the Ulster Unionist Party and was elected to Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council in the Portadown area during the 2014 council elections. On Saturday 7 May 2016, he was elected as an MLA for the Upper Bann constituency. In advance of the 2017 Ulster Unionist Party leadership election Beattie was cited by commentators to be a possible contender to replace former leader Mike Nesbitt; however, in the end only Robin Swann ran, and was elected unopposed. In October 2019, after Robert Swann announced that he was standing down as leader of the party, Beattie ruled himself out of contention as the next leader and endorsed former Royal Navy commander Steve Aiken. On 14 November 2019, Beattie announced his candidacy as a Member of Parliament for Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency), in the 2019 General Election. He lost by a large majority to the DUP's Carla Lockhart.

Santa Caterina with octagona dome and unfinished facade. History The church was commissioned by the Dominican order, and dedicated to St Catherine of Siena. A sumptuous church, modelled after the Pantheon of Rome was designed originally by Giovanni Del Fantasia; however, after construction began in 1720, progress was slow and interrupted, and thus a new design was ordered in 1729 from Alessandro Saller, then Giovanni Masini, and finally Giuseppe Ruggieri. While the church was consecrated finally in 1753, the facade still remains unfinished. The lantern tower was completed in 1869 by Dario Giacomelli. The dome rises 63 meters to the lantern. Interior decoration, including the frescoes of the Evangelists in the cupola, were added in the 19th century by Cesare Maffei. Other paintings depict St Dominic receives the Rosary and Three Mysteries of the Madonna. In 1785, the Dominican order was suppressed in Tuscany, and the church was granted to the Confraternity of Saints Cosmas and Damian. In 1808, Napoleonic forces suppressed the church and converted it into a prison. It was reconsecrated in 1822, and reverted to Dominicans control only in 1871. Above the main door is a canvas depicting the Coronation of Mary by Giorgio Vasari. That painting was once in the Vatican and only acquired for the church in the 19th century.

It is also called San Ferdinando Re or the Church of the Crocetta. Nearby is the deconsecrated church of Sant'Anna. The church of San Ferdinando History In 1653, the mendicant Trinitarian Father Francesco di San Lorenzo, who recurrently traveled to Tunisia to redeem Christian slaves, instituted in the Livornese neighborhood of Venezia Nuova a Congregation dedicated to this purpose of ransoming Christians in the North African Muslim states, called the Compagnia della Natività della Madonna (Confraternity of the Birth of the Virgin). The Trinitari, after over a decade in Livorno, in 1667 built a small convent and oratory, at the site of a former chapel dedicated to the birth of the Virgin and Mary's mother. The confraternity was ultimately aggregated to a Roman confraternity dedicated to the same purpose. By the 19th-century this structure was at risk of collapsing and razed. Construction of the church of San Ferdinando was commissioned by the early 1707 under designs of Giovanni Battista Foggini, and completed nearly ten years later by Giovanni del Fantasia. The church was dedicated to St Ferdinand, King of Castille, the medieval scourge of Al-Andalus, in part to recognize the initial patronage of Prince Ferdinando, son of Granduke Cosimo III. However, the death of Ferdinado in 1713, forced the Trinitarians to raise further money for its construction. The church was consecrated in November 1717 and was restored after the 1742 and 1824 earthquakes. The exterior facade is plain without marble sheathing; the interior, however, is highly decorated in a baroque style. Interior The layout is that of a Latin cross. The masterpiece inside the church is the main altar's sculptural group depicting the Liberated Slaves by Giovanni Baratta, depicting an angel with one liberated and one still chained slave.Guida storica ed artistica della città e dei dintorni di Livorno, by Giuseppe Piombanti Forni Editore, Bologna 1903, pages 199-203. Main altar: Liberated Slaves by Giovanni Baratta. The church has two chapels on each side. The first altar on right is dedicated to the Blessed Giovan Battista della Concezione dei Trinitari. The second on the right is dedicated to the canonized founders of the order Giovanni di Matha and Felice, the priest Giovanni Cibri di Carrara. It has sculpted reliefs of the Saints in adoration of Holy Trinity. The chapel at the crossing, dedicated to Jesus the Nazarene, houses a wooden statue resembles that found in a Trinitarian church of Madrid, rescued in 1681 from Morocco. The marble statuary on the main altar was sculpted by Giovanni Baratta, depicts an angel appearing to John of Matha, displaying at his feet a freed Christian slave and a chained moorish slave. Another chapel is dedicated Madonna del Buon Rimedio (Our Lady of Good Remedy), Marian devotion held by Trinitarians and Matha in particular reverence. Over the doors of the crossing, four oval bas-reliefs depict the cardinal virtues, on the main altar are statues of Faith and Hope. The English aristocrat Peter Yarvis of Sandwich endowed a chapel in 1720; in memory of his namesake, the altar has a marble relief depicting St Peter receives the Keys from Christ. The last chapel has a canvas of San Michele dei Santi. The pilaster niches houses statues of canonized Kings (first four in marble; latter two, stucco): Ferdinand III of Castile, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor of Germany; Louis IX of France; Edward the Confessor of England; Leopold III, Margrave of Austria; and Casimir of Poland. Suppressed by Napoleon in 1808, the parish remained without clerics till 1848. In August 1853, the trinitarians re-acquired the parish and convent. It later became an elementary school. During the Second World War, the Venezia Nuova district was heavily bombed, and the church suffered destruction of the bell-tower and some chapels, but underwent reconstruction.Catholic World, Volume 74 page 629 San Michele dei Santi, Livorno. by Montgomery Carmicheal.

He advocated an anti-metaphysical and materialist approach to history. Early life He was the son of the poet Moritz Hartmann and his wife Bertha, daughter of Achilles Roediger, a Genevan headmaster and bourgeois liberal educators. From 1872, when Ludwig was seven, his father suffered a long term illness and was often bed-ridden. One consequence of this was that he not only spent a lot of time with his father, but also met a variety of bankers, writers, scientists, doctors, artists and university professors who came to visit his father. These included the politician Ludwig Bamberger, the surgeon Theodor Billroth , the philosopher of history, Theodor Gomperz, the legal historian Adolf Exner and the historian Heinrich Friedjung. After his father's death, his mother prioritised his education with support from Bamberger. He subsequently attended Gymnasium Wasagasse and went on to study history, legal history and political economy at the Universities of Vienna and Berlin. Among his teachers were Otto Hirschfeld, Lujo Brentano and particularly Theodor Mommsen. Popular education He was an advocate of popular education, establishing a 'popular university course at the People's College. There is a biennial Ludo Hartmann prize awarded by the Verband Österreichischer Volkshochschulen. The Ludo- Hartmann-Platz in Ottakring, Vienna, is named after him.

It is an erect shrub with densely hairy branches and leaves, narrow leaves and pale lilac-coloured flowers and which emits a strong odour. Description Eremophila microtheca is an erect shrub which grows to a height of between and which emits a strong odour. The branches are covered with fine, branched hairs except for glabrous bands under the leaves. The leaves are linear to almost cylindrical in shape and are mostly long and about wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 hairy, overlapping, lance-shaped, tapering sepals which are mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are pale lilac to purple on the outside and white inside with purple spots. The petal tube and lobes are glabrous except for a few hairs inside the tube. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and the fruits which follow are dry, oval-shaped, wrinkled, glabrous and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1882 by Ferdinand von Mueller and George Bentham from specimens collected by Augustus Frederick Oldfield at Port Gregory. They gave the species the name Pholidia microtheca and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1882, Mueller changed the name to Eremophila microtheca, publishing the change in Systematic Census of Australian Plants. The specific epithet (microtheca) is derived from the Ancient Greek μικρός (mikrós) meaning \\"small\\" and θήκη (thḗkē) meaning \\"case\\" or \\"sheath\\" in reference to the small fruits of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila microtheca occurs in moist places between Kalbarri and Eneabba in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. Conservation status Eremophila microtheca is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture The massed display of blue or purple flowers of this shrub are attractions, but not its unpleasant odour and it needs to be grown where this is not a problem. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It will grow in most soil types, including the clay soil in which it grows naturally but needs to be grown in full sun. Mature plants tolerate long drought or temporary flooding but they do not grow well in areas of high humidity. It will also tolerate light frosts and an occasional light pruning.

She sometimes wrote articles using the masculine pseudonyms John Prendergast and John Prendregeist.

Kahn, Portrait Miniatures Flow Out of the Attic, The New York Times (September 19, 2013): C30.Concordia University: Canadian Women Artists History Initiative She and her brother William were twins. Their father Alexander Arthur was from Montreal, Canada. She was educated in Montreal, Boston, as well as at the Art Students League of New York and the Académie Julian in Paris. In New York, she studied with George de Forest Brush, Carroll Beckwith, and John Henry Twachtman. She married Henry Behenna in 1885. Career  Painting and organizing  Behenna painted miniature portraits on ivory, often of American socialites of the Gilded Age for art collector Peter Marié, including Antoinette Polk, Baroness de Charette Anna Hall Roosevelt, and Amélie Rives Troubetzkoy.Baroness de Charette, New-York Historical Society. She also made a portrait of Louise, Princess Royal. Her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts and the Modern Gallery in London. She also painted five panels of a frieze, The Path of the Soul, displayed at the Tiffany Glass Building in New York in 1906. She later moved to Étaples, France, where she was a member of the Etaples art colony. In 1915, Behenna was organizing chair of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, and created chapters in New York and Baltimore, to prepare and coordinate women's relief efforts during World War I. Behenna was a suffragist.  Disappearance and spiritualism  In 1907 she was in Ottawa to show her miniatures and paint Lady Evelyn Grey, daughter of the Governor General, when she disappeared, prompting a police investigation. She explained later that she had decided to take a train to Virginia, because \\"I went to Ottawa an optimist and returned a pessimist,\\" elaborating that \\"I was chilled to the soul by the atmosphere of petty malice, superficiality, lack of courtesy and active hostility in which I found myself.\\" Behenna was interested in spiritualism. In 1899, she told the press that she had been contacted by a spirit named Helios, and told the location of a gold mine in the United States. Helios also instructed her to adopt a specific diet, and to write an epic poem in eight cantos, about Rameses II. She wrote a short book of poems, which she claimed to have received \\"through auditory control\\" from the spirit realm, Mystic Songs of Fire and Flame (1921). She used the masculine pseudonyms John Prendregeist and John Prendergast, interpreting the surname as meaning \\"to grasp the spirit.\\" In 1921, Behenna lectured in Washington, D.C. on \\"Color: Its Effect on Human Health and the Preservation of Youth in the Body\\", and read her poetry at the Arts Club of Washington. In 1922, she visited Montreal to lecture on \\"The Coming Race\\". In 1923, she explained to audiences that \\"the time will come... when everyone must live right, and think pure thought, as everyone else will be able to read their mind and tell what they are thinking about.\\" Personal life and legacy Katherine Arthur briefly married Henry Carstairs Behenna in 1885, and divorced shortly after. They had a daughter, Vivian Margaret Behenna. Katherine Behenna died from a cerebral haemorrhage in 1926 after she was found unconscious in her Chelsea studio, apparently after visiting China, and using toxic products to dye her hair.

Portal to Library Reading Room History The library was founded in 1726 in a site adjacent to the church of Santi Filippo e Prospero. The basis of the collection was the library of the Cardinal Carlo Agostino Fabroni.Cardinal Fabroni was born in Pistoia in 1651, and died in Rome in 1727. Refurbishment of the building to hold the library began in 1722; the endowment conditioned that the library \\"always and forever serve with ease the public needs of the city.\\"sempre, et in perpetuo servire a commodo, ed uso publico della città\\". The cardinal's collection was transported from Rome to Livorno by two galleys commissioned by Pope Benedict XIII, and then overland to Pistoia. The library was first housed and administered by the Pistoiese Oratorian congregation. It was open to the public in 1730 and competed with the other large library of Pistoia, the Biblioteca Forteguerriana. In 1810, following the suppression of the Oratorians, the administration moved to the City, and after the fall of the Napoleonic regime, to the Chapter of the Cathedral Chapter, as envisaged in the bequest of Fabroni. The Cathedral still manages the facility.Comune of Pistoia , entry on Biblioteca Capitolare Fabroniana], curated by Anna Agostini. Structure and Collection The building was refitted to make a library by Francesco Maria Gatteschi. The portal with the superiorly concave tympanum consisting of two half-arches, nestles the coat of arms of Cardinal Fabroni.Le dimore di Pistoia e della Valdinievole, by Emilia Daniele, page 37. The staircase entrance is decorated with quadratura frescoes, and opens to a large reading room, dominated by a statue of the cardinal by Gaetano Masoni. On either side of the entrance are two marble sculptures, depicting the \\"Birth\\" and \\"The Deposition\\" by Augusto Cornacchini. The scroll above the door threatens the curse of excommunication to any that steals a book from the room.\\"Excomunicatio contra extrahentes\\". The book stacks are two stories high, and at each corner of the room is a small reading cubicle. The library was further enlarged in 1869 by the Countess Eugenia Caselli, the last female descendant of the Fabroni family, in 1917 by the collection of the Pistoiese lawyer Tommaso Gelli and by the addition of collections from both the Oratorions and Franciscans from the Giaccherino. Assets now include nearly 20,000 printed volumes, including precious incunabula and over 400 manuscripts. The cardinals collection included nearly 2,400 folios, 1,800 quartos, and 2,460 sesti; the collection covered subjects of theology, philosophy, history, geography, mathematics, and philology. It was notable for including books under censure by the Church, but accessible to the cardinal by virtue of his post as Secretary of the Propaganda Fide. The library collections now cover the works of the Fathers of the Church; ecclesiastical histories; rules of monastic orders; hagiographic works of the Sacred Rota; documents on Jansenism; the Council of Trent; and the Bolla Unigenitus for which Fabroni was a major author, and which censured Jansenism. Besides these, there is an important collection dedicated to the Catholic Jesuit missions in China, works of medicine, physics, natural sciences, arithmetic and geometry.Comune of Pistoia, entry on Biblioteca Fabroniana.

While the action sequences and Weber's performance were reasonably well received by critics, most felt the film's dialogue and overall story were subpar, with the caveat that aficionados of the genre would appreciate it far more. Synopsis In Northern England, about 1089, some twenty years after the genocidal \\"Harrowing\\" (the Harrying of the North ordered by William the Conqueror to quell a series of rebellions), a former slave and Norman princeling has taken the name Shadow Walker (Stanley Weber) upon returning to his father's former lands. There the earl Durant (Karel Roden) rules as a despot with his equally cruel sons Lord Artus (Gianni Giardinelli) and Lord Romain (Edward Akrout). Shadow Walker makes common cause with and rallies a large band of exiled rebel Anglo-Saxon farmers led by Anna (Annabelle Wallis). Durant is his treacherous uncle, who murdered his own brother and usurped the power of the earldom, his nephew's birthright. One way or another, the question will be decided through battle. Cast Annabelle Wallis in 2017 Genre and influences Sword of Vengeance is influenced by samurai films and the Hollywood western movies and spaghetti westerns which evolved from them. Director Jim Weedon has been a fan of the chambara style from childhood: \\"I was intrigued with the idea of creating a medieval world that tonally sat within this style. Immediately we gave the film a very distinct and unexpected look and style.\\" The influence of chambara is particularly evident in the choreography of the sword fights: > Often when watching medieval sword fights they become tedious, clumsy and > dull. Whereas the samurai films with their shorter swords lent themselves > to... much faster and action orientated aspects in any given fight > sequence... I was constantly looking for quick kills, sword slices that were > hard and fast for the visual impact and to give us the energy and excitement > of the battles as the heroes cut through cipher after cipher. Production Sword of Vengeance was produced by Vertigo Films and Red Production, \\"which has a long tradition of cooperation with foreign productions\\". Vertigo producer Huberta Von Liel noted that except for a few leading actors, the director, and the director of photography, everyone else involved, about 150 cast and crew, were from Serbia. Background Jim Weedon began his career as a film editor, and was encouraged to try directing by Ridley Scott. While Sword of Vengeance was his first feature film, this was \\"after cutting his teeth editing music videos and television commercials.\\" He had won awards for his previous work. Weedon was approached by Von Liel, who asked if he would be interested in making a period revenge drama: \\"I was incredibly interested in the opportunity but also the fact that Vertigo Films allowed me total creative control visually.\\" Writing and characterisation When Julian Unthank joined the project to develop the script, he and Weedon \\"stripped back the dialogue to a minimum, something that was used a fair amount in the Spaghetti Westerns.\\" > We didn't want the film to fall into the standard cinematic tropes, although > the script is a basic premise of revenge we wanted the story to unfold in > more unexpected prose, especially the ending. I also wanted our hero to be > an antihero, rather than the man that saves the day. His character although > conflicted tries to atone for his sins but it comes too late, however, his > absolution from Anna in the final scene allows him to find peace and solace > from his chosen path of revenge. Design Aesthetically, Weedon went for what he called a \\"bleach bypass approach\\" to grading \\"to achieve very little colour in the film.\\" Wardrobe was designed to be \\"muted,\\" working with blues, greys and black; \\"the only real colour coming through is the inherent hues from the fur that the heroes wore.\\" The film's already low colour palette was accentuated by principal photography taking place in winter, as Jennie Kermode notes; everything appears dark, the sky a \\"miserable grey,\\" and the land \\"hard and unyielding.\\" Weedon said he wanted the film to \\"look and smell of the dark ages.\\" > Every aspect of the film from locations to clothing had to look worn, beaten > and broken. I had shot some commercials in Serbia and found that they had > very talented crew in all departments. Milos Djukelic had just co-produced > Ironclad 2 so was ahead in terms of the requirements we needed to create > this harsh and foreboding world. Filming and editing Location scouting took place in July 2013. Sword of Vengeance was filmed in thirty days in four locations in Serbia. These were the forest of Bojčinska Šuma, in the Progar area of Belgrade, as well as the fortress in Kalemegdan, Deliblato and Pancevo Reva. Weedon said he lost half a stone (seven pounds) the first four weeks into the shooting schedule, which was five to six days a week, in harsh weather, wading through mud every day, and later it snowed: \\"days and nights were spent knee deep in mud that at dawn was dangerously frozen ice and by mid morning a muddy mass that was equally harsh.\\" However, the most difficult part was actually the first two days: > Ridiculously we decided to shoot the opening sequence which involved rain > fx, horses, stunts, and prosthetics. It was the crew's first two days > together, suddenly we are in the rain with actors who can't ride, horses > that won't stand still, actors who are going into hyperthermia, and > prosthetic limbs that refuse to come apart properly, add in stunts that > could only be repeated three to four times, blood that wouldn't squirt > sufficiently and the opening crane move into scene that kept breaking down. > I did ask myself how the hell did I get into this mess. Weedon described the editing of the film with Tom Boulding as \\"incredibly fast\\". Sound and music With so little dialogue in the film, it fell to the sound designer, Roland Heap, and the composer, Stephen Hilton, to \\"convey the unsaid.\\" Weedon wanted the audience to have a \\"musical roller-coaster ride\\": \\"Sound is integral to my commercial work and something that always creates the unexpected in the visuals.\\" Release and reception The world premiere of Sword of Vengeance took place at the Sitges Film Festival, where it was in competition, on 10 October 2014. It had its Serbian premiere on 5 March 2015 at the Belgrade International Film Festival. The British theatrical release did not follow until 29 May. Home media and streaming Sword of Vengeance has been available on DVD and DVD/Blu-ray (Well Go USA Entertainment, Universal Studios Home Entertainment) and streaming services (Google Play, iTunes, Hulu) since May 2015. Critical response Stanley Weber in 2018 The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes assigns Sword of Vengeance a rating of 13% based on eight reviews. Critics gave faint to fair praise to the fight scenes, and to Stanley Weber's performance, but found the film wanting otherwise, though acknowledging at the same time that the fighting sequences would be enjoyed by action film fans. Allan Hunter's review following the world premiere at Sitges set the tone for critics into 2015: > The only things that appear to be lacking is an original story and some > decent dialogue... Stanley Weber's Shadow Walker is very much in the > Eastwood tradition down to the squint in his eye and the poncho-like garment > draped over his strapping shoulders. He is a man with no name but a > remarkably good hair stylist to maintain those immaculate cornrows... The > plot is pretty basic but served up with some style by Weedon... His vision > of England is bleak, oppressive and uniformly monochrome. It sometimes seems > as if the only colour in the palette of cinematographer August Jakobsson is > the crimson of fresh blood. There is a good deal of blood though as limbs > are hacked off, throats are slit and eyes plucked out with merry abandon. > Weedon keeps it tight and spare but the real drawbacks are the weary > plotting and cheesy dialogue. Frank Scheck, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, opines that the title \\"pretty much says it all\\": there are \\"enough clanging sword fights, severed limbs, slit throats and bare-bones dialogue to satisfy genre fans while pretty much failing to provide something of interest to anyone else\\"; the film, while \\"admirably stylish\\", has the feel of an 11th century-set video game. Stanley Weber stands out among the cast, \\"even managing to make such declarations as \\"Vengeance is my only belief\\" sound convincing.\\" Josh Oakley complains that the dialogue is \\"overwrought and bland, with the actors apparently instructed to take long pauses between each line\\" and \\"much of the cast\\" seem to have accents like Tommy Wiseau's. Ernest Hardy of The Village Voice said the film \\"hits its mark of being a popcorn action flick just fine.\\" James Luxford of the Radio Times said there is a \\"brutal simplicity to the action that will appeal to some,\\" but otherwise, Sword of Vengeance \\"seems stretched even for a relatively short film.\\" Jennie Kermode assigned the film 2 stars out of 5, saying the fight scenes were uneven but: \\"Weber's work is carefully choreographed and will please fans of fighting films even if it does sometimes take liberties with physics. This is important because there really isn't much else in the film at all.\\" Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent agreed: \\"The ritualised action sequences work well enough. It's just a pity the film-makers did not pay as much attention to the plotting as to the design of the movie.\\" Mike McCahill, writing for The Guardian, found the film \\"perversely watchable\\" and \\"modest post-pub fun\\"; while it is a \\"low-budget\\" Game of Thrones \\"cash- in\\", it at least improves upon its producers' previous effort, the \\"risible\\" Hammer of the Gods. Critics at Time Out and The Daily Star characterised the film as a \\"daft\\" slasher.

Sachin Jose of International Business Times awarded 2.5/5 and praised Mohanlal's \\"remarkable\\" performance but criticized the screenplay.

Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com rated 2.5/5 and stated \\"This film is made in a technically slipshod manner.

Mathew of Mathrubhumi stated \\"By refraining from action scenes the director did his best to bring in that Hollywood style craft.

It is sometimes considered a part of the Dal lake and is connected to it via a narrow strait. It is also connected to the Khushal Sar and Gil Sar lakes via a channel known as Nallah Amir Khan.Unni,K.S.  Etymology  The Nigeen lake is surrounded by a large number of willow and poplar trees. Hence, it has come to be referred as a \\"nageena\\", which means \\"the jewel in the ring\\". The word \\"nigeen\\" is a local variant of the same word.  Location  The lake is located adjacent to the Hari Parbat hillock, to the west of the Dal lake. To its north and west, lie the localities of Baghwanpora and Lal Bazar while to its north east lies the locality of Hazratbal, which is known for the famous shrine.  Present status  The lake is a major tourist attraction in Srinagar, known for its relatively pristine waters as compared to the Dal lake. Houseboats and shikaras are a usual sight. Its also ideal for swimming, being deeper and less crowded than the Dal lake. The nigeen lake has a very serene and fully equipped nigeen club which has restaurant fitness centre and private yachts. The place is surrounded by many top restaurants like chickblast, othersidecafe, snooker cafe, and a beautiful park. However, as is the problem with other water bodies in the Kashmir Valley, the lake also suffers from encroachments which are deteriorating its water quality and also increasing the risk of floods.

Between 1981 and 1993 he served as First Secretary of the Tunisian Communist Party, and in 2007 he became an honorary president of the Ettajdid Movement. He was a member of the country's Chamber of Advisors (Upper legislative assembly) from 2008 till its dissolution in March 2011. Life Early years Born into an artisan \\"chaouchi\\" Tunis family, Harmel studied at the city's Sadiki College. During this period he engaged politically with the Tunisian Communist Party, and distributed leaflets in support of Tunisian independence. He was arrested in September 1949 following a street demonstration organised by the \\"Tunisian Committee for Liberty and Peace\\", and held for several months in the (non-military) prison in Tunis. In May 1951, at the fourth party congress of the Communist Party, he was elected a member of the Party Central Committee. Following a study period at a teacher training college, in 1951 he embarked on a teaching career at Djebel Abiod (as it was then known) and in other towns. He pursued his teaching career when possible till 1956, but the years were not entirely without incident for him in other respects. He was arrested in February 1952 at Béja during a demonstration against the deportation of Nationalist and Communist leaders, and sent to the detention camp at Téboursouk. Released in 1953, he took charge in 1954 of the journal \\"Sawt el Oumma\\" (\\"Voice of the nation\\"), and then found himself back in prison after inciting dock workers to boycott a French ship transporting military equipment. This time he was released only when the French president, Pierre Mendès France visited Tunisia on 31 July 1954, as part of what turned out to be the buildup to a peaceful transition to Tunisian independence less than two years later. Recalling these experiences much later in his life, Hamel explained that he had been \\"processed through the military court\\" and \\"could have been given a death sentence\\", adding that \\"the mood often became heated between Destorian and Communists during [their] imprisonment at Téboursouk, and later, each time they encountered each other while leafleting in the streets. Party office In May 1956, at the fifth congress of the Tunisian Communist Party, he was elected to the party politburo and secretariat. In 1957 his name was at the top of the party's candidate list in the Tunis electoral district for the municipal elections. In January 1963, after a plot to assassinate the president was uncovered, the Communist party was banned and Harmel was arrested in the same month, along with other members of the party leadership, Abdelhamid Ben Mustapha and Hédi Jrad. A few months later they were released. Discussing the matter later Harmel said that Habib Bourguiba had accused them of having supported the 1962 assassination plot, even though he would have been strongly opposed to it. Exile and party ban In 1963 Hamel embarked on a lengthy period abroad, spending time in France, Prague and Moscow, in order to recover his health and \\"preserve his life\\" (\\"gagner [sa] vie\\") as he would put it. After an eight-year exile he returned to Tunisia in 1971. Mohamed Harmel was elected Party First Secretary in February 1981 at the eighth party congress. The congress took place under conditions of secrecy because the Communist Party was still banned. The ban lifted Harmel recalled later a conversation he had with President Bourguiba on 18 July 1981 at Skanès (Monastir). Harmel had requested the meeting in order to thank the president for having lifted the country's eighteen-year ban on Communist publications. Bourguiba asked what had become of the Communists, who had been so much a part of the Tunisian political landscape in the 1940s and 1950s. \\"We are no longer visible, Mt President, because you decided to ban Communist Party activities\\".« Nous ne sommes plus visibles parce que vous avez décidé, Monsieur le Président, d'interdire les activités du PCT ! » After a few seconds of reflection Bourguiba replied, in magisterial terms, that the ban should be lifted at once.«Levons donc aussitôt cette mesure d'interdiction !» Later on the same day the ban on the Tunisian Communist Party was lifted. On 7 October 1981 Harmel founded , a weekly tabloid newspaper. At this stage the paper was the official organ of the Tunisian Communist Party and Harmel, as Party Secretary, became its first Director. Despite periodic government bans, the newspaper would outlive the Tunisian Communist Party itself, banned permanently by the government only in 2009. Meanwhile, the party's ninth party congress was able to be held openly in Tunis in June 1987: Harmel was re- elected to the post of First Secretary. Leader of Ettajdid The Tunisian Communist Party reinvented itself as the Ettajdid Movement (Movement for Renewal / حركة التجديد) in 1993. In addition to the rebranding, the change seems to have involved the abandonment of certain old Communist dogmas and a more accommodating attitude to the mainstream Tunisian political establishment. Harmel's presence in a leading position within the new movement was nevertheless a mark of continuity. He was elected and served as a deputy in the legislative assembly between 1994 and 1999. At one stage he became President of the Commission for Parliamentary Immunity, in the process becoming the first opposition deputy to become president of a commission. The 1999 presidential election was subject to an upper age limit of 70, which debarred him from standing, but Harmel asserted that he would not have stood for president even if he had been permitted to do so. Instead he unequivocally backed Ben Ali for re-election. The ongoing theme of his politics was \\"consensual democracy\\": voters were reminded of the importance of the \\"gains of \\" in the Ettajdid electoral manifesto for the 1999 legislature elections.Election manifesto of Ettajdid « Avec nous pour reconstruire le mouvement démocratique progressiste », quoted in Attariq Al Jadid, August 1999 This was a reference to the coming to power as president on that date of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. For the 2004 presidential election Mohamed Harmel was again debarred from standing on account of his age. He was 75. He did participate in that year's elections for the legislature, but failed to be re- elected despite his name appearing at the top of the Ettajdid party list for the Tunis electoral district. Following this disappointing result the Ettajdid national executive issued a communiqué on 12 December lamenting the \\"exclusion\\" of their party general secretary from the National Assembly as damaging to the pluralism in the chamber. According to the historian Larbi Chouikha this communiqué contained echoes of the 1990s when the Communist Party was advocating \\"consensual democracy\\" combined with power. Final years Mohamed Harmel stood down as Ettajdid Party Secretary at the party conference of 30 July 2007: he was succeeded by Ahmed Brahim.« Un parti d'opposition change de chef, veut une coalition laïque », Agence France- Presse, 6 August 2007 He was immediately proclaimed, and unanimously elected, Honorary Party President, which was a post expressly created to mark the movement's appreciation of the historic scope of his political contributions. According to Brahim, interviewed a few months later, it was Harmel who had himself wanted this change at the top of the party, having in effect already let it be known that he would not be standing for re-election. Elsewhere, however, there are signs that he was not entirely relaxed about losing power and influence within the movement. Directly before the congress of July 2007 he prepared two pieces for the party newspaper, Attariq Al Jadid. These were headed, \\"In all candour\\" in the Arab language section and \\"Question mark\\" in the francophone section. They were not included in the special Party Congress edition of the paper, and in an open letter to readers published in August 2008 Harmel explained why he had not written for the paper again, because of management conditions imposed in respect of his contributions. In 2007 he insisted in an interview that he had laid down all control organisational responsibility of his own will, also explaining that the 2007 party congress had never specified the nature of his role as Honorary Party President, which some had been content to leave as a fudge in a way that was less than comradely and that shocked him. But he insisted that he was nevertheless not riled by the situation. The choices had been his own, made with a good conscience, and it was \\"normal\\" that others would take over. In 2008 President Ben Ali appointed him to the Chamber of Advisors, which was the upper house under Tunisia's bicameral legislative structure. The category under which he was nominated was that of \\"personalities and national experts\\" (\\"personnalités et les compétences nationales\\") which meant that he took the seat vacated by the lawyer, Habib Achour. Mohamed Harmel died on 18 September 2011. Paying tribute, his successor Ahmed Brahim declared that Tunisia had lost a great patriot and great fighter in the service of the people, for democracy and progress.\\"La Tunisie perd un grand patriote et un grand militant pour la cause de la démocratie et du progrès au service du peuple.\\" References Ettajdid Movement politicians Tunisian Communist Party politicians Members of the Chamber of Advisors Alumni of Sadiki College People from Tunis 1929 births 2011 deaths ","title":"Mohamed Harmel"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/24.md","filePath":"sponsor/24.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/24.md"},x=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,x as default};
