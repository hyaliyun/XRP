Part of this text is reproduced online at City of Quebec: Valmont-Martin avenue was a Canadian physician and politician, serving as mayor of Quebec City from March 1, 1926 to December 7, 1927. Biography Valmont Martin was the son of Henri-Josu√© Martin and Am√©lia-Jeanne Verge. He studied at the S√©minaire de Rimouski. He was a medical doctor, a graduate of Universit√© Laval. Beginning in 1899, he practiced medicine during 32 years in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood in the town of Qu√©bec. He married Eug√©nie Brunet. He was an alderman (√©chevin) in the Jacques-Cartier ward of Qu√©bec from February 26, 1912, until 1917, and an alderman in the Saint-Roch ward from 1917 until March 1, 1924. Martin was candidate for the office of mayor in the 1924 election but he was defeated by incumbent mayor Joseph Samson, who was in office since 1920. In the February 15, 1926, election, Martin was again a candidate against Samson and this time Martin was elected mayor, by a narrow margin. Soon after taking office, Martin contracted an unspecified illness and was bed-ridden for several months. Then, he became disenchanted by disagreements between the members of the city council and by the financial difficulties of the city due to insufficient revenues. His two-year term of office was due to end in March 1928, but in the Autumn of 1927 Valmont resigned and, on November 29, 1927, the city council appointed him as the director of the municipal Hygiene service and of the H√¥pital civique. (Officially, he left office as mayor on December 7, 1927, after the nomination of his successor). He was succeeded by T√©lesphore Simard, who was chosen by the city council for completing the remaining months of the mayoral term of office. In 1929, Martin became an associate professor at universit√© Laval. In 1931, he became head physician of the Soci√©t√© d'hospitalisation. Avenue Valmont-Martin in Qu√©bec is named after him since 1959 (it was named \\"avenue Martin\\" from 1959 until 2006 and was renamed \\"avenue Valmont-Martin\\" in 2006).

She first appeared in The Day of the Clown. Conception Rani was introduced into The Sarah Jane Adventures as a replacement for departing character Maria Jackson, played by Yasmin Paige. Paige left the series as a regular due to her wanting to complete her GCSEs, thus, Maria moved to America because her father had been offered a job there. Rani's parents, Haresh and Gita Chandra, replace Maria's parents, Alan and Chrissie Jackson, as Alan departs with their daughter and Chrissie no longer has reason to show up. Rani shares her name with the Rani, a recurring villain from the classic series of Doctor Who. Russell T Davies told readers of Doctor Who Magazine that Rani is \\"not the Rani\\". Appearances Rani first appears in the second story of Series 2, following Maria's departure. In The Day of the Clown (2008), Rani and her parents move into the Jacksons' old house at 12 Bannerman Road(sometimes 36 Bannerman Road), opposite Sarah Jane (Elisabeth Sladen) and Luke Smith's (Tommy Knight) house, in Ealing, London. Her father is the new headteacher of the school where she, Luke and his best friend Clyde Langer (Daniel Anthony) are pupils; her mother owns the Bloomin' Lovely florist. An aspiring journalist, Rani soon joins Sarah Jane's investigative gang. In the Series 3 premiere Prisoner of the Judoon (2009), Rani and Clyde are banned by extraterrestrial police force the Judoon from space travel as punishment for interference in their work. Although grounded on her terrestrial homeworld, she is nobility of an unspecified alien planet. A humanoid child monarch known as Gavin creates her Lady Rani in appreciation of her assistance in his succession which also saved the whole of humanity. Coincidentally, she is continually addressed as Lady Rani in the subsequent serial, when she is transported to the court of Queen Jane and mistaken for a newly summoned lady-in-waiting. The Series 3 story The Mad Woman in the Attic focuses on Rani. Sarah Jane discovers that, in violation of her rules, Rani has shared her adventures in letters to her former school friend Samuel; the events of the episode cause two timelines to occur, one where in 2059, Rani has acquired Sarah Jane's home at 13 Bannerman Road and become miserable and alone, and another where she will have a son and grandchildren and still friends with Luke and even her predecessor, Maria, living with her family at the former Smith home. Rani's final appearance comes in the last episode of the programme, The Man Who Never Was (2011). Rani makes a further appearance in \\"Farewell, Sarah Jane\\" (2020), an epilogue for the series where years after the events of the main series, she becomes a full time journalist and is writing a story for a project at the North Pole. She finds out that Sarah Jane has died and along with Clyde and Luke, organise her funeral where everyone is celebrating her life. Rani chooses to believe that Sarah Jane did not pass away but rather went with the Doctor to travel the universe, forever. Characterisation The official The Sarah Jane Adventures website offers the following description of Rani Chandra: In an interview for SFX, Mohindra asserts that Rani and Maria are only similar in the extent that they are both girls, live in the same house and \\"[i]n personality terms...[they are] both quite strong-willed\\", although she notes that there are \\"a lot less tears from Rani than there were from Maria.\\" She describes Rani's relationship with Sarah Jane as \\"a lot different\\" to that between Sarah Jane and Maria. Mohindra notes that Rani is \\"very much an apprentice of Sarah Jane...[although] at first...Sarah Jane is not really that interested in taking on another child.\\" Rani shadows Sarah Jane and copies her behaviour to help her deal with a situation. She is keen on fighting mentally as opposed to physically and Mohindra likes the fact that Rani is \\"a girl between two guys at times\\". Reception Reviewing the second series of The Sarah Jane Adventures for Digital Spy, Ben Rawson-Jones writes that: \\"As Rani, Anjli Mohindra was fine with dialogue, but painfully self-conscious on a physical acting level when compared to the effortless ease with which Daniel Anthony and Tommy Knight portray Clyde and Luke. It was almost as if someone was stood slightly off set operating her with strings. That theory at least fits into the whole 'body possession' procession of the second season.\\" Following Rani's first appearance, Michael Bush writes for Den Of Geek: \\"Rani is another asset to the fledgling cast: a gabby young journalist whose inquisitive nature leads to a run in with alien foes. Comparisons between Rani and Sarah Jane's former companion Maria are almost inevitable, and bound to be divisive, but - based on this episode, at least - Mohindra gives as good as she takes, and her character manages to be interesting and endearing without treading on Miss Jackson's toes.\\" References External links Television characters introduced in 2008 The Sarah Jane Adventures characters Female characters in television Fictional people from London Teenage characters in television ","title":"Rani Chandra (The Sarah Jane Adventures)"},{"id":"19115628","text":"Rafflesia tuan-mudae is a member of the Rafflesiaceae family. It lives as a parasite on the Tetrastigma vine. The enormous flowers may reach over 1 m in diameter. The buds normally emerge where the vine is growing along the ground, unlike some of the other Rafflesia species whose buds can emerge from vines hanging in the air. In the Malaysian language, tuan-mudae translates as 'Beloved or young Prince' after Charles Brooke the British Rajah of Sarawak. Locally the flower is referred to as bunga pakma - \\"bunga\\" means \\"flower\\" in Malaysian. Typically the flowers are around 60 cm in diameter opening from a 20 cm bud. Occasionally these buds reach 30 cm in diameter in which case a flower nearly 1 m across may form. R. tuan-mudae in Gunung Gading National Park Life cycle The flowers can be found on liana-like vines, specifically Tetrastigma rafflesiae and Tetrastigma diepenhorstii. The seeds reach the host plant by an unknown animal vector, penetrate the tissue of the root and grow inside the host tissue for an indefinite period of time before buds develop. The bud develops for 9 months, before it becomes a gigantic orange to red flower. It stays in full bloom for just 7 days. The main pollinator for this flower are flies. All Rafflesia flowers emit a rotting meat stench attracting pollinators, although the smell of R. tuan-mudae is comparatively mild. However, they are no less effective at attracting these flies, upon whose back pollen is deposited. Male and female flowers can only be identified by fingering under the central disk for the anthers. However, visitors are encouraged not to touch or handle the buds in particular, as they are fragile and may die. Distribution In Sarawak, one of the easiest locations to see R. tuan-mudae is at Gunung Gading National Park, at the park headquarters or near Waterfall 7.Forest Department Sarawak: Gunung Gading National Park In July 2008, one of the largest flowers measuring 95 cm was recorded in the park.

A former collaborationist and criminal who at one time was sentenced to death, Giovanni often drew his inspiration from personal experience or from real gangsters, such as Abel Danos in his 1960 film Classe tous risques, overlooking that they had been members of the French Gestapo. In his films as well as his novels, while praising masculine friendships and advocating the confrontation of the individual against the world, he often championed the underworld but was always careful to hide his own links with the Nazi occupiers of France during World War II. Biography Youth Of Corsican descent, Joseph Damiani received a good education, studying at the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris and the Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly. His father, a professional gambler who was sentenced to a year in prison for running an illegal casino, owned a hotel in the French Alps in Chamonix. Joseph worked there as a young man and became fascinated by mountain climbing. The Occupation and Collaborationism From April to September 1943 Damiani was a member of Jeunesse et Montagne (Youth and Mountain) in Chamonix, part of the Vichy Government youth movement controlled by Pierre Laval. In February 1944 Damiani came to Paris and through his father's friend, the LVF leader Simon Sabiani, he joined Jacques Doriot's fascist French Popular Party (PPF). His maternal uncle, Ange Paul Santolini alias \\"Santos\\", who ran a restaurant patronized by the Gestapo, and his elder brother, Paul Damiani, a member of the Vichy paramilitary Milice, introduced Joseph into the Pigalle underworld. In March 1944 Joseph Damiani went to Marseille where he became a member of the German Schutzkorps (SK), an organization which hunted down Service du travail obligatoire - STO (Compulsory Work Service) dodgers. He served as bodyguard to its Marseille chief and took part in many arrests, often blackmailing his victims. In Lyon, in August 1944, posing as a German police officer along with an accomplice (Orloff, a Gestapo agent who was shot for treason at the Liberation), Damiani blackmailed Joseph Gourentzeig and his brother-in-law Georges Edberg, two Jews who were in hiding. Gourentzeig had bribed a member of the Milice - a friend of Damiani‚Äôs ‚Äì in an attempt to secure his parents' release from a detention camp. They were not freed and Gourentzeig's father, Jacob, was shot by the Germans shortly after, on 21 August 1944, along with 109 Jewish hostages in the Bron (Lyon airport) massacre. The triple murder After the Liberation in Paris on 18 May 1945, Joseph Damiani, his brother Paul, Georges Accad, a former Gestapo agent, and Jacques M√©nassole, a former member of the Milice wearing a French Army lieutenant's uniform - all posing as Military Intelligence officers - abducted Ha√Øm Cohen, a wine merchant, accusing him of being a black marketeer. He was tortured until he gave them the key to his safe and a check for 105,000 francs. He was then shot and his body thrown into the Seine. Joseph Damiani cashed the check at Barclay's Bank under the identity of \\"Count J. de Montreuil\\". A few days later, on 31 May 1945, the same gang, still masquerading as French Army Intelligence, abducted two brothers, Jules and Roger Peugeot, electrical appliance manufacturers in Maisons-Alfort. The brothers were forced, at gunpoint, to write a letter stating that they had been in business with the Germans and in contact with the Gestapo. The gang then demanded a million francs for destroying the letter. The Peugeot brothers refused and were tortured until they revealed where they had hidden 125 Louis d'or gold coins. They were then shot and their bodies buried in the woods near Versailles. Joseph Damiani, who had accidentally shot himself in the leg during the struggle with the Peugeot brothers, was arrested at home in early June 1945. Accad was also apprehended. On 12 June 1945 M√©nassole, on the point of being arrested, committed suicide in the Rue Montmartre m√©tro station. Paul Damiani was arrested in Strasbourg in July 1945, escaped in December and was shot dead in a gunfight between gangsters on 17 July 1946 in a bar in Nice. Twenty years hard labor and D√©gradation nationale for Collaboration with the enemy On 20 July 1946 Joseph Damiani was sentenced to twenty years hard labor by the Marseille Court of Justice for his participation in the German Schutzkorps and in the arrest of Frenchmen sent to the STO (Compulsory Work Service) in Germany. He was also sentenced to D√©gradation nationale (deprivation of all civil rights) for life for having been a member of the PPF fascist party. Sentenced to death for three premeditated murders Damiani had admitted during the investigation that he had shot Roger Peugeot, but he denied it in court. Tried by the Paris Cour d'Assises, Georges Accad and Joseph Damiani were sentenced to death on 10 July 1948 for the premeditated murders of Ha√Øm Cohen, Roger Peugeot and Jules Peugeot. Damiani escaped the guillotine when his and Accad's sentences were commuted by President Vincent Auriol on 3 March 1949 to hard labor for life. Ten years imprisonment for blackmailing hidden Jews during the Occupation On 25 May 1949 Damiani was sentenced by the Paris Correctional Tribunal to ten years imprisonment for having blackmailed at gunpoint Joseph Gourentzeig (hiding from the Gestapo under the name \\"Andr√© Courent\\") and his brother-in-law Georges Edberg in Lyon on 11 August 1944. Eleven and a half years in prison On 14 November 1951, Damiani's sentence was reduced to twenty years hard labor. Finally, President Ren√© Coty remitted the sentence on 30 November 1956 and Joseph Damiani was released from prison at the age of thirty-three on 4 December 1956 after serving eleven and a half years. The writer and film-maker Straight after his release from prison, Damiani wrote his first novel, The Break (Le Trou), under the name of \\"Jos√© Giovanni\\". It tells of the escape he attempted from prison with four other inmates by digging a tunnel from their cell into the Paris sewers in 1947 when he was awaiting trial for murder. His lawyer, who had encouraged him to write, took the book to author and editor Roger Nimier through whom it was published by √âditions Gallimard. His style, at times uncouth and clumsy, can surprise the reader with its strong and sometimes disturbing scenes. The novel was turned into a film by Jacques Becker in 1960. In 1958 the editor Marcel Duhamel introduced Giovanni to the S√©rie noire publishing imprint, where he came to notice with the publication of three novels that same year: * Classe tous risques, which was filmed by Claude Sautet in 1960. * L'Excommuni√©, which Jean Becker adapted into the film Un nomm√© La Rocca starring Jean-Paul Belmondo in 1961, and was later remade by Giovanni in 1972 as La Scoumoune, with Belmondo in the same part and Claudia Cardinale. * Le deuxieme souffle (Second Breath), filmed by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1966, with a remake, ', by Alain Corneau. Jos√© Giovanni wrote twenty-one novels and a volume of memoirs (Mes Grandes Gueules). After having worked with Jacques Becker on the adaptation of The Break, Giovanni wrote thirty-three film scripts and directed fifteen movies. Revelation of a hidden past In January 1984, Joseph Damiani was declared \\"rehabilitated\\", which did not absolve him - there was no retrial - but restored his civil rights. During his lifetime Jos√© Giovanni never gave a clear explanation for his death sentence, though he took pride in being a former gangster and having been on death row. However, he never mentioned that he had been convicted for Collaborationism with the Nazis or for extorting money from Jews during the Occupation. On 14 October 1993, two Swiss dailies, La Tribune de Gen√®ve and 24 Heures, revealed his past and that Jos√© Giovanni was in fact the same person as Joseph Damiani, the convicted fascist militant. At first Giovanni denied the accusations, claiming he had helped the R√©sistance and then insisting that he had been sentenced to death for a crime that had nothing to do with Collaborationism. He threatened to sue the press for slander but never did. Finally, he stated : \\"I've paid. I am entitled to forgiveness and oblivion\\". Last years Jos√© Giovanni defended right-wing values, the family, law and order and tougher punishment but was a staunch opponent of the death penalty. However, he believed in personal vengeance: \\"Any man that snatches a child from its mother's arms deserves death\\". In his last years he spent time visiting prisons. From 1968 on, he lived in the Swiss village of Mar√©cottes, not far from Chamonix, and died from a brain haemorrhage on 24 April 2004 in Lausanne.

On 28 July 1939, the I and II Medium Tank battalions received 96 Fiat M11/39 tanks to replace its Fiat 3000s. The inadequacies of the M11/39 tanks led to a decision on 26 October 1939, to replace them with M13/40 tanks and the first batch, built by Ansaldo at Genoa in October 1940, were used to equip the III Medium Tank Battalion with 37 of the new tanks.

XXII Corps ( Petassi Manella) was in general reserve, XXI Corps ( Lorenzo Dalmazzo) was at Tobruk as the 10th Army reserve with the un-motorized 61st Infantry Division \\"Sirte\\", 2nd Blackshirt Division (28 October) and a light tank battalion. The XXIII Corps ( Annibale Bergonzoli) comprised the un-motorized 64th Infantry Division \\"Catanzaro\\" and 4th Blackshirt Division (3 January). A northern column with the Italian non-motorised divisions was to advance down the coast road, cross the frontier and attack through the Halfaya Pass, to occupy Sollum and capture Sidi Barrani. A southern column with the 1st Libyan Division \\"Sibelle\\", 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\" and the were to advance along the track from Dayr al Hamra to Bir ar Rabiyah and Bir Enba south of the escarpment, round the British inland (southern) flank. The flanking manoeuvre by the misfired, because it lacked adequate maps and navigation equipment for desert travel and the group got lost as it moved to its jumping-off point at Sidi Omar. XXIII Corps Headquarters (HQ) had to send aircraft to guide the group into position. The accompanying 1st Libyan Division \\"Sibelle\\" and 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\" were also delayed in reaching the rendezvous near Fort Capuzzo and the fiasco led Graziani to cancel the wide flanking manoeuvre. The 10th Army, in a mass of five divisions and the armoured groups, was ordered to move down the coast road, occupy Sollum and advance to Sidi Barrani through Buq Buq. Once at Sidi Barrani, the army would consolidate, extend the Via Balbia by building the to move supplies forward, destroy British counter-attacks and then advance to Mersa Matruh. The immobility of the non-motorized infantry divisions forced Graziani to use the coast road, despite the mechanised forces in the army, to try to defeat the British with mass rather than manoeuvre. Western Desert Campaign Invasion of Egypt XXIII Corps advanced to Sidi Barrani along the coast road, having received enough lorries to motorise one infantry division and partly to motorise three more for the advance. Bergonzoli planned the advance with the 1st forward, followed by the fully motorised 1st Blackshirt Division (\\"23rd Marzo\\") and the 62nd Infantry Division \\"Marmarica\\" and 63rd Infantry Division \\"Cirene\\", which had been partly motorised and could shuttle elements forward. The un-motorized 1st Libyan Division \\"Sibelle\\" and 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\", were to march on foot for the to the objective and the was to form the rearguard. The 1st was also kept in reserve, except for the LXII Light Tank Battalion with L3/33 tankettes, which was attached to the 62nd Infantry Division \\"Marmarica\\" and the LXIII Light Tank Battalion assigned to the 62nd Division Infantry \\"Cirene\\". The 2nd remained at Bardia, except for the IX Light Tank Battalion which joined the 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\". The (3rd ) had the II Medium Tank Battalion with M11/39 tanks and three Libyan infantry battalions, all motorised. The 10th Army advanced to Sollum then along the coast road two divisions forward, behind a screen of motorcyclists, tanks, motorised infantry and artillery. On 14 September, the rest of the 1st followed the 1st Libyan Division \\"Sibelle\\" and 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\" toward Bir Thidan el-Khadim. At Alam el Dab, just short of Sidi Barrani, about fifty Italian tanks supported by motorised infantry and artillery, tried to outflank and trap the British rear guard, which forced the 3rd Coldstream Guards battalion to retreat. By late on 16 September, the 1st had reached an area south-east of Sidi Barrani, with the 1st Blackshirt Division (\\"23rd Marzo\\") and the XXIII Corps artillery, having been used cautiously for infantry support. The was west of the objective, having been hampered by lack of supplies and disorganisation. The 1st Blackshirt Division (\\"23rd Marzo\\") took Sidi Barrani and the advance stopped at Maktila, beyond. Operation Compass Nibeiwa The 10th Army planned to advance on Mersa Matruh on 16 December but the attack was forestalled by Operation Compass. Only the IX Light Tank Battalion with L3/33 tankettes attached to the 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\", the II Medium Tank Battalion with M11/39s, with the at Nibeiwa camp and the LXIII and XX Light Tank battalions, with the XXI Corps HQ, were still in Egypt. The five fortified camps from the coast to the escarpment were well defended but too far apart for overlapping fields of fire and the defenders relied on ground and air patrols to link the camps and watch the British. The camp at Nibeiwa was a rectangle about , with a bank and an anti- tank ditch. Mines had been laid but at the north-west corner, there was a gap in the minefield for delivery lorries and a British night reconnaissance found the entrance. A lack of Italian air‚Äìground co-operation was exploited by the British to attack Nibeiwa camp from the rear, with the 11th Brigade Group of the 4th Indian Division and the Matilda infantry tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment (7th RTR). Italian air reconnaissance spotted British vehicle movements in the area but Maletti was apparently not informed. On 8 January, Maletti alerted the nearby 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\" that unusual low- level flying by the RAF was probably intended to disguise the movement of armoured units. At on 9 January, well before the beginning of the main British attack, Maletti had contacted the commanders of the 1st Libyan Division \\"Sibelle\\" and the 2nd Libyan Division \\"Pescatori\\", reporting the British preparatory movements. At on 9 December, British artillery commenced a one- hour diversionary bombardment from the east and at the main 4th Indian divisional artillery opened fire. The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade Group and the 7th RTR attacked from the north-west, with Bren carriers on the flanks, all firing on the move. About twenty Italian medium tanks outside the camp were destroyed in the initial British attack, while warming their engines before breakfast. Italian artillery and machine-gun fire began as isolated parties of Italians tried to hunt the British Infantry tanks with hand grenades. At Scottish and Indian infantry began methodically to sweep through the camp, backed by artillery and the tanks. By the camp had been overrun and and Libyan prisoners had been taken, along with a large quantity of supplies and water for a British loss of A total of and Libyan soldiers had been killed along with Maletti and wounded. Aftermath Analysis In his history of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to counter-attack the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his tent with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen at the entrance of his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering around looking for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found to be full of food, new equipment and ammunition.

She was earlier believed to have been the mistress or perhaps even wife of the exiled prince Gustav of Sweden, son of king Eric XIV, and her eldest son Lars was believed to have been the forefather of the noble Swedish families of Eldstierna and Stierneld. The story behind the legend The history about Brita Karth and her alleged children with prince Gustav was the product of baron Adolf Ludvig Stierneld (1755-1835), courtier and a well-known collector of historical documents, whom historians have later found also to be a ruthless forger of such documents. Wishing to claim a royal ancestry for his own family Stierneld reported having found handwritten notes by Brita Karth herself regarding her relation and family with Gustav in an old pious book that was to have been given to her by Gustav's mother, Karin M√•nsdotter. Although Stierneld's claims were at the time accepted by the Swedish House of Nobility they were also soon refuted by historians and genealogists, beginning with an essay by A.T.G. Oxenstierna in 1869 and later by noted archivist and genealogist Victor √ñrnberg (1839-1908) in Svenska √§ttartal. Today Brita Karth and her children are regarded as completely fictional. Brita Karth according to the legend Brita Karth was said to have been born about 1568 in Silesia as the daughter of a Swedish warrior named Peder Karth and to have died somewhere after 1594. She is said to have married prince Gustav in Kashin in Russia in 1594 after already having delivered four children of his: Lars (or Laurentius) (1586-1660), Eric (1588-?), Carl Gustav (1590-?) and Catherine Sigrid (1592-?).

The route currently runs from the Owings Mills Town Center to Glyndon via Reisterstown Road and the Owings Mills Metro Subway Station. The line, which was a split-off from the final version of the now defunct Route M-9, and resembles the former Route M-16 that operated from 1987 to 1998. The route was previously named No. 56 before BaltimoreLink, when it was replaced in its entirety by Route 87.http://baltimorelink.com/routes/route-56 History Before BaltimoreLink, Route 87 was operated as Route 56, and has only been operating under this designation since February 17, 2008. Its route, however, has a long history of being served by other bus and streetcar lines. The no. 56 designation was once previously used in Baltimore transit history for a line that operated from Murray Hill (near Rodgers Forge) to Bedford Square (near Charles Village). This line operated from 1948 to 1953 before being merged into the current Route 11, the main bus route for the Charles Street corridor.http://www.btco.net/Routes/Obscure.html#56 1916 to 1932 Service on Reisterstown Road was provided by the No. 5 Streetcar Line, which ran from Emory Grove to Patterson Park, providing transit along all parts of Reisterstown Road in Baltimore County. The no. 5 streetcar had the most northern terminus of all Baltimore streetcars. At this time, the corridor was far less developed than it is today. 1932 to 1948 In 1932, the no. 5 streetcar was shortened to Pikesville. Service between Pikesville and Emory Grove was provided by Bus Route M (no relationship to M-lines). 1948 to 1959 In 1948, the no. 5 streetcar was completely converted to a bus operated. The new line was identified as the no. 5/7 line. 1959 to 1984 In 1959, the no. 5/7 line was split into two separate lines with these designations. The no. 7 bus line provided service on all parts of Reisterstown Road from Glyndon to Pennsylvania and North Avenues, then continued along Pennsylvania Avenue to downtown Baltimore and Canton along the same route as the present no. 7 line. Even after the line was shortened in 1984 in favor of shorter Metro feeder buses, Route 7 buses continued to operate along this full route hourly on Sundays until 2001, when the Metro connection buses started to operate 7 days a week, some 24 hours a day.September 2001 schedule changes 1984 to 1987 On June 18, 1984, in conjunction with the opening of the Baltimore Metro Subway, several bus routes in the northwest section of the Baltimore area, including Route 7, were shortened, and portions of them were replaced with various feeder buses that brought riders into various Metro stations. A new Route P-1 was formed that operated between the new Reisterstown Plaza Metro Subway Station and Reisterstown during Metro's hours of operation.http://www.btco.net/Routes/routemet.htm 1987 to 1997 On August 31, 1987, in conjunction with the extension of the Metro to Owings Mills, all P-lines were replaced with M-lines. Route P-1 north of Painters Mill Road was replaced with a new Route M-16, which fed into the new Owings Mills Station. The new M-9 line provided service on Reisterstown Road between Patterson Avenue and Painters Mill Road. 1997 to 2008 In 1997, Route M-16 was combined with Route M-9, which was extended to Reisterstown, with selected trips to Chartley (then a branch of Route M-16). This provided single-seat service along all portions of Reisterstown Road in Baltimore County, as well as improved midday and Saturday service to Route M-16 and to the Owings Mills Town Center. A new Route M-17 was also formed that provided peak hour service to the Owings Mills Corporate Campus and the Business Center at Owings Mills. Sunday service was added in 2001 that was identical to the Saturday schedule.Owings Mills Times In 1999, the destination signs on Route M-9 were changed from \\"Reisterstown\\" to \\"Glyndon\\" to avoid confusion caused by buses along Painters Mill Road and at the Owings Mills Metro Station and Town Center that were traveling in opposite directions (southbound buses had flashed between \\"Reisterstown\\" and Plaza Station.\\".MTA notice published in 1999: Northbound M-9 buses will be marked \\"Glyndon\\" to avoid confusion In 2000, the Chartley branch was discontinued. For a brief period of time, the trips that once operated to Chartley were laying over at a loop near a Food Lion supermarket in Reisterstown, but due to complaints from residents of this neighborhood, these trips were later rerouted to the Glyndon loop along Hanover Pike where all other buses lay over. In 2007, it was proposed that the line would be split into two routes, numbered 56 and 59, that would be similar to the pre-1997 routes M-9 and M-16, but with higher frequencies. This change, which went into effect on February 17, 2008, was planned in order to improve schedule adherence on both routes.Owings Mills Times At the same time, trips via Dolfield Road were discontinued, and all trips on Route 56 operate via Painter Mill Road to Reisterstown Road.

Playing career Club Kurz played mostly as a winger but by the end of his career he had been deployed as a central midfielder on occasions. Slight in stature, his preferences lay in the ball control, the game overview and the positional play. He began playing football as a pupil at Klosterneuburg drill ground and eventually played for the Vienna school boys' team and the youth team at First Vienna FC where he played alongside Victor Hierl√§nder and Karl Jiszda. In 1915, he began playing for Floridsdorfer Amateurs but after just three games he joined the Austrian Army and in May 1916 he was sent into battle during World War I.

They cater for gaelic football, hurling and camogie. History Founded in 1956 by local gaels,Edward Sherry, Tony Colaluca, Christy Mannion, Austin Hinds, Paddy Laverty, Sean Hayes and Brendan and Seamus Boylan amongst others, St Enda's have grown from a small rural club to the biggest GAA club in North Belfast which is the social and cultural epicentre of the local community, often in the face of violent adversity. In the late 1950s, Henry Campbell who owned land on the Hightown Road offered one of his fields as a pitch to play on. Subsequently, the club moved to another of Campbell's fields, which was bought for ¬£5000 in 1972. In the same year the club won its first major trophy when they won the Junior Championship. The teams in the 1970s were back-boned by the many families in the club to mention a few, the McCreas, Devlins, Burns,Hinds's, Farrells, Hamills, Duffys, Lemons, Lawell family and the O'Conners. Further achievements followed winning Division 4 Hurling; The Junior Hurling Championship, 1990, 1992,2012; Division 3 All County Football, 1975; Division 3 Football again in 1984, Division 2 Football in 1987, 1989, 2002 playoff final and the All County 7-a-side tournament in 2001. St. Endas Senior hurling team are the current Junior Hurling Champion of Antrim with a landslide victory over Cushendun. The club continued to develop despite the many attacks on the club during the troubles, the club premises being destroyed in 1972 and badly damaged in 1983. Mr. Devlin, whose family was involved in the club, was shot and killed at the entrance to the club. A housing development opportunity in the mid-1980s allowed the club after negotiations with a developer to purchase with the help of grant aid the site of the new pitch and clubrooms. The President of the G.A.A., Seosamh Mac Donncha officially opened the new pitch and clubrooms on 4 May 1998. At underage level St Enda's have progressed, winning divisional medals at all age levels throughout the years. The dedication of all juvenile mentors has continued down the years, the importance of an active juvenile section being the lifeblood of the club. Over the past 5 years or so traditional cultural activities have played a large part in the life of the club. A School of Music infuses the gra of traditional music to many youngsters weekly, with vibrant tin whistle, fiddle and bodhran lessons, complementing the beat of the tackle and clash of the ash on the pitch. In 2003, members Ciaran McCavana, Dara Woods and Niall Murphy furthered the aims of a previous committee which sought to promote the Irish language in a practical and beneficial way by joining the Irish language education revolution which is sweeping Belfast and the rest of the north. Naiscoil Eanna, the first Irish language nursery school in Glengormley, opened in September 2004.

The riot occurred after the alleged wrongful arrest of an Asian man by the West Yorkshire Police which was alleged to have been heavy-handed. More than 100 Asian, White, and Black youths were together involved in the six-hour-long rioting against the police. The West Yorkshire Police later stated that any attempt to legitimise criminal behaviour by saying it is connected with racial tension or the style of policing is just an excuse for young males committing crime on the streets. It was the first rioting in Leeds since the Hyde Park riots of 1995. The Police Officer involved in the alleged wrongful arrest was questioned, and later cleared of any wrongdoing. Wrongful arrest allegations The wrongful arrest allegations involved Hossein Miah, who was arrested over a suspicious tax disc. Miah alleged that the arresting officer pulled him from his vehicle causing him injury. The Police Complaints Authority cleared the officer of any charges relating to the incident, but expressed regret for \\"any distress which has been caused to either Mr Miah or his family.\\" Start of rioting Banstead Park, where the riots began. Sporadic unrest had already begun in the area when a hoax 999 call was made at 20:25 saying a police officer had been hit by a petrol bomb. The police could not locate this, however the call lured them into Banstead Park, where they were met by a barricade of burning washing machines and furniture, looted from a nearby second hand shop. It was in Banstead Park where most of the confrontation took place, although the disturbances spread onto Roundhay Road, Roseville Road and smaller residential streets towards the south side of Harehills. By the time darkness had fallen the rioting had begun, and continued into the early hours of the following morning. End of rioting After over 200 participants spent over seven hours rioting, the police managed to make enough arrests to quell the size of the crowd to a point where it dispersed and the police could regain control. Damage The aftermath of the Harehills riots Over the course of the rioting 26 cars were burnt out, two police officers and two journalists were severely injured, and a shop was set alight. Both police officers and members of the public were pelted with bottles and bricks. Aftermath Many arrests took place following the rioting, local shops were advised only to secure their premises and not to reglaze, as the police feared more rioting would take place, however the riot seemed to be an isolated incident and the violence did not continue beyond 6 June 2001. Sentencing On 7 March 2002, nine months after the riots, 25 men were imprisoned after being found guilty of their involvement in the riot.

In developing the G 10, however, the T 16 running gear with side play on the first and fifth axles was modified. The T 16 was also subsequently built with this modified configuration and called the Prussian T 16.1. The G 10 was intended for heavy goods train duties on main lines, but as a result of its low axle load it could be employed more flexibly than its equally powerful cousin, the Prussian G 8.1. The G 10 was occasionally even used in passenger train service. Between 1910 and 1924 no less than 2,615 Class G 10s were delivered to the Prussian state railways and the Deutsche Reichsbahn, 35 to the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (see Alsace-Lorraine G 10) and 27 to the Saar Railway. Another 350 were sent to railway companies in Turkey, Romania, Poland and Lithuania. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over almost all the Prussian engines and continued to build the G 10 until 1924. After the First World War, 222 G 10s went to foreign railways. According to the first provisional renumbering plan of 1923,several locomotives were delivered as Class 33s, but from the end of 1923 the newly delivered locos were given their final numbers. The G 10 was allocated numbers 57 1001-2725 and 57 2892-3524. Amongst them was number 57 1124, a G 10 from Alsace-Lorraine. In 1935 the G 10s from the Saar Railways were given numbers 57 2727-2763, of which 57 2737-2763 were the Saar Railway copies built from 1921-1925. In the Second World War more locomotives were taken over from Poland as 57 2764-2772 and 57 2784-2804 and from Luxembourg as 57 2773-2783. After the war a former G 10 from Alsace-Lorraine found itself in the GDR and was classified as 57 3551. It was joined by another G 10 of unknown origin, no. 57 4245. Nine G 10 locomotives were ceded to Italy as war reparation after World War I, and were taken over by the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane as Class 473 (Italian: Gruppo 473). In 1950, the Deutsche Bundesbahn had about 649 ex- Prussian G 10s in its fleet, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany) had 112 and the Saar Railways had 81. The Bundesbahn reclassified its G 10s as Class 057 in 1968, but had retired them by 1970, the last one out of service being 057 070-5 on 22 September 1970. The Reichsbahn completed their retirement of G 10s by 1972. From 1916 the Austrian Empire's military railway (k.u.k. Heeresbahn) had 20 G 10s which were designated as Class 680 and were specifically intended for duties on the broad gauge Russian Railways. Several of them were given Reichsbahn numbers 57 2766-2768 and 57 2789-2792 during the Second World War. After the war, some 165 engines of Class 57.10-35 remained on Austrian territory. Of these 96 continued in service as the √ñBB Class 657. The Austrian Federal Railway (√ñBB) retired them all by 1968. Number 657.2770, an engine obtained by the Austrian Society for Railway History (√ñGEG) from Romania, has been preserved in working order and is used for special services. The vehicles were equipped with various tenders, including Prussian pr 3 T 16.5, pr 3 T 20, pr 2'2' T 21.5 and pr 2'2' T 31.5 tenders as well as the Bavarian bay 3 T 20. which had been taken over from Bavarian G 4/5 N and G 4/5 H locomotives.

Widespread rioting in Chapeltown also occurred in 1975 and 1981. During the 1981 riots, rioting took place not only in Chapeltown, but also in London, Birmingham and Liverpool. The riots of 1987 began Sunday, 21 June, when a black teenager, 17 year old Marcus Skellington, was arrested and beaten by police. It is estimated that 70 teenagers participated in smashing shop windows, looting and attacking police officers 22 and 21 June. On 23 June, shops, cars, and windows were burned, bombed and stoned, including a sex shop which was completely burnt down. The burning of the sex shop was particularly significant for two reasons. First, it was not widely supported or wanted by the local community and had been protested prior to the riots. Second, it was believed that the police carried out surveillance of the Hayfield Pub car park for marijuana dealing from above the sex shop, despite the sex shop operating illegally at times.

It was based on the novella of the same name by Stefan Zweig. The film stars Joan Fontaine, Louis Jourdan, Mady Christians, and Marcel Journet. In 1992, Letter from an Unknown Woman was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\"National Film Registry\\" . Library of Congress, accessed October 28, 2011. Plot In early twentieth century Vienna, Lisa (Joan Fontaine), a teenager living in an apartment building, becomes fascinated by a new tenant, concert pianist Stefan Brand (Louis Jourdan). Stefan is making a name for himself through energetic performances. Lisa becomes obsessed with Stefan, staying up late to listen to him play, and sneaking into his apartment and admiring him from a distance. Despite her actions, they only meet once and Stefan takes little notice of her. One day, Lisa's mother (Mady Christians) announces her marriage to a wealthy and respectable gentleman, who lives in Linz, and tells Lisa that they will all move there. Lisa resists her mother's plans and runs away from the railway station and goes back to the apartment, where she is let in by the porter. She knocks on Stefan's door, but no one answers. She decides to wait outside for him to return. Early the next morning, Stefan returns home with a bride. After seeing the two, a distraught Lisa travels to Linz where she joins her mother and new stepfather. In Linz, she is transformed into a respectable woman and courted by a young military officer from a good family. He eventually proposes to Lisa, but she turns him down, saying that she is in love with someone else living in Vienna and is even engaged to be married to him. Confused and heartbroken, he accepts her situation. When they learn about Lisa's actions, her mother and stepfather demand to know why she did not accept the proposal. \\"I told him the truth,\\" replies Lisa. Years later, Lisa is estranged from her parents and works in Vienna as a dress model. Every night she waits outside Stefan's window, hoping to be noticed. One night he notices her, and although he does not recognize her, he finds himself strangely drawn to her. They go on a long, romantic date that ends with their making love. Soon after, Stefan leaves for a concert in Milan, promising to contact her soon, but he never does. Lisa eventually gives birth to their child, never trying to contact Stefan, wanting to be the \\"one woman you had known who asked you for nothing.\\" Ten years later, Lisa is now married to an older man named Johann (Marcel Journet) who knows about her past love for Stefan, for whom she named their son. One day while at the opera, Lisa sees Stefan, who is no longer a top-billed musician and rarely performs. Feeling uneasy, she leaves during the performance. He sees her leave and follows her, and so they meet while she is waiting for her carriage. Stefan explains that he can't quite place her but felt they must have met before. Lisa is still uncomfortable with this, not wanting to anger her husband, and when her carriage arrives, she is met by a clearly vexed Johann. A few nights later and against her husband's wishes, Lisa travels to Stefan's apartment, and he is delighted to see her. Despite a seemingly illuminating conversation about Stefan's past life and his motivations for giving up music, Stefan still does not recognize who Lisa really is. Distraught and realizing that Stefan never felt any love for her at all, Lisa leaves. On her way out she meets the servant and the two exchange a long glance. Sometime later, after her son dies of typhus, Lisa is taken to a hospital and is gravely ill herself. She writes a letter to Stefan explaining her life, her son, and her feelings toward him; the letter that narrates the whole film. After Lisa dies, the letter is sent to Stefan, along with a card from the hospital staff announcing her death. In shock, Stefan thinks back to the three times they met and he failed to recognize her. \\"Did you remember her?\\", he asks his servant. The servant nods and writes down her full name, Lisa Berndle, on a piece of paper. Still in shock, Stefan leaves his building and sees the ghostly image of a teenage Lisa open the door for him, the same way she once did when he first noticed her all those years ago. Outside, a carriage waits to take him to meet a dueling opponent, Lisa's husband, Johann. Finally intending to take responsibility for his actions, Stefan decides to engage in the duel.

The film is mostly faithful to the book, though featuring minor divergences. The male protagonist in the book is simply referred to (once) as 'R', and is a novelist rather than a musician. The film renames him Stefan Brand (referencing Zweig, who also lends his name to the protagonist's infant son, also unnamed in the original source material). The \\"unknown woman\\" receives no name in the book; in the film she is called Lisa Berndle (a quirk of Oph√ºls is having his female characters names' starting with an L). Fernand, a relative of Lisa's mother and eventual husband, is turned into the completely unrelated \\"Mr. Kastner\\", with the family moving to Linz rather than Innsbruck. John, the servant, retains his name, but in the film, he is mute. The novel's sexual content is quite implicit, but because of censorship, the movie adaptation further dims it. In the book, the \\"unknown woman\\" spends three nights with the writer (rather than one) before his departure. She meets him only one more time, many years later, at the opera, at which she promptly loses her present lover in favor of spending a fourth night with the writer. At the conclusion of this, she is humiliated when he mistakes her for a prostitute, and rushes off, never to see him again. The movie adaptation splits these into two separate encounters (first meeting him at the opera, and then rushing off humiliated from his house), and ignores another sexual encounter. Further divergences include a more prolonged \\"first encounter\\" between the two lovers (taking them through stagecoaches, fairs and ball rooms rather than simply cutting to the long-waited sexual encounter), revealing the disease that kills Stefan Jr. and Lisa to be typhus and ignoring Lisa's tradition of sending Brand white roses every birthday. At the start of the novel, Brand has just turned 41 (and forgotten about his birthday). This is significant because the absence of white roses confirms Lisa's death at the time of reading. The most significant divergence is a structural change: there is no duel in the original story, nor is there a character such as Johann. The \\"unknown woman\\" from the book never marries, but lives off a series of lovers who remain unnamed and mostly unintrusive. Because of this, the protagonist's actions offend no one in particular. In the film, Brand is challenged to a duel, which he initially plans to ditch. The finale reveals the contestant to be Johann, who demands satisfaction over Lisa's affair. Having read Lisa's letter, Brand boldly accepts the duel and walks into it, his fate uncertain. This redeeming action has no literary equivalent. In fact, Brand's literary equivalent can only faintly recall Lisa after reading the letter, and there's no significant event past this. Reception Letter from an Unknown Woman is very highly regarded by today's critics. Tim Dirks of Filmsite has listed it among the 100 greatest American movies of all time, and the film holds 100% approval among 22 critics on Rotten Tomatoes.

Diddley built his first guitar in 1945, it was trapezoid shaped since Diddley felt that the regular shaped Gibson L5 he was playing were hindering his live performances. The smaller trapezoid and rectangular guitars allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. Diddley went on to play a number of rectangular guitars built by himself and others, which soon became one of his trademarks throughout his career. In 1959 Bo approached a former Gretsch employee known only as \\"Juliano\\" to build him some guitars from his own designs using Gretsch necks and hardware. The resulting three guitars (Jupiter Thunderbird, Cadillac and Cigar Box), two of which were named after popular automobiles became synonymous with Diddley and his '60s stage partner \\"The Duchess\\" Norma-Jean Wofford. The Jupiter was later donated as a gift to ZZ Top frontman Billy Gibbons who used it on some ZZ Top recordings.

It has been the site of a number of shipwrecks, including one in 1894 that was carrying a cargo of Scotch whisky. History Fortification Thorne Island commands the entrance to the anchorage of Milford Haven and access to the former Royal Dockyard at Pembroke Dock. A proposal was made to fortify the island in 1817, but it was not implemented. In the 1850s, there was growing concern about the increasing strength of the French Navy and the expansionist policy of the Emperor Napoleon III.Hogg, Ian V (1974), Coast Defences of England and Wales, 1856‚Äì1956, David & Charles, (p. 20) Work started on the existing fort at some time after 1852 and a date of 1854 is carved above the entrance. The fort is an irregular polygon in plan and was designed with a seaward facing battery for five RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns and four 68-pounder guns, all mounted en barbette (i.e. in an open mounting, firing over a parapet). The landward side of the fort consists of a defensible barracks, with a loopholed parapet overlooking the entrance. In 1860, the report of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom commented that \\"Although these batteries [ie: Thorne Island Fort, Dale Fort and West Blockhouse Fort] would prevent an enemy from making use of the anchorage at the mouth of Milford Haven, they would not prevent the passage of steamers of war, and therefore would not suffice to protect the dockyard or the haven itself.\\" This was due to the limited number and size of guns that the existing fort could bring to bear on any fast moving target.Reports from Commissioners: Sixteen Volumes: Coal Mines, Inland Revenue, Post Office, Ordnance Survey, Defences of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), London 1860 (Report commencing p. 431 ‚Äì p. xxxix of the report) The report recommended to Lord Palmerston that further forts should be strengthened or constructed to counter the potential threat of the French Navy. Eventually twelve forts were constructed around the entrance to Pembroke Dock and Milford Haven including Fort Hubberstone, Popton Fort and Stack Rock Fort. 20th century The fort was converted into a hotel in 1947 and was sold in 1999 for ¬£275,000.Mystery buyer for island, 27 July 1999, BBC, accessed 31 August 2008 In 2001 it was owned by the Von Essen hotel group who intended spending four million pounds to reopen the hotel with a five star rating and a cable car to allow access from the mainland.

The fort became a Grade II* Listed Building in 1996, because it was \\"a well-preserved fort of Palmerston's Haven defences\\". Wrecks The Loch Shiel Even without the fort, the island and the rocks around it were a hazard to any shipping. Divers recognise over twelve wrecks that are worth diving in the area of the island but of special interest is the sailing ship that sank in 1878.Ship wrecks of Pembrokeshire, dive- pembrokeshire.com, accessed 31 August 2008(some say 33) people were rescued from the 1878 built sailing ship Loch Shiel which had run into rocks off the island.

The Thai name (from the original Malay, Pulau Nipis) is transliterated in many different ways into English. The most common names are \\"Koh Lipe\\", \\"Koh Lipeh\\", \\"Ko Lipey\\", and \\"Ko Lipe\\". Ko Lipe is on the border of the Tarutao National Marine Park and is directly south of the larger islands Ko Adang and Ko Rawi, and about 50 km from the island of Ko Tarutao. It was originally settled by a group of Malay-speaking sea gypsies (chao leh in Thai and 'orang laut' in Malay), known as the Urak Lawoi‚Äô people.  Access  During high season (October to June), there are several locations from which travellers can take a ferry or speedboat to Ko Lipe, including: Ko Lanta, Pak Bara, Phi Phi, Trang, and Langkawi (Malaysia). During low season (Mid June to mid October), the only way to get to Ko Lipe is by speedboat from Pak Bara. The ferry from Langkawi to Ko Lipe operates from mid October until mid June. From Langkawi, travellers can depart / arrive at Kuah Jetty Terminal or Telaga Harbour Terminal. From Ko Lipe, travellers can depart / arrive at Bundhaya Resort or Pattaya Beach. The journey will take about 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Tourism  Ko Lipe has three main beaches: Sunset Beach (Hat Pramong), Sunrise Beach (Hat Chao Ley), and Pattaya Beach. The calm, clear water makes Ko Lipe ideal for snorkeling, with 25 percent of the world's tropical fish species found in the area.  Environmental concerns  Development on the island is rapidly growing to meet the increase in tourism, leading to issues with waste management, wildlife conservation, and energy supplies. The parks department is trying to control the amount of building on Lipe as many developers have built resorts on National Park land. Upon arrival at Ko Lipe you must pay a National Park admission fee and environmental fee.  Activity  Popular activities for visitors include; sight seeing of natural features, water sports such as snorkeling and kayaking, boat trips to nearby islands and reefs such as Ko Usen and Ko Kra and drinking and dining, particularly fresh seafood on walking street. Visitors take in sunrise views on Sunrise beach and partake in nightlife on Pattaya Beach.

The line currently runs from the Essex campus of the Community College of Baltimore County to Turner's Station in Dundalk. The current route serves the Rosedale, Middle River, and Essex areas and the CCBC Essex and Dundalk campuses. The line was previously known as Route 4 prior to the launch of BalitmoreLink. LocalLink Route 62 replaced the entirety of Route 4 on June 18, 2017.http://baltimorelink.com/routes/route-04 History Route 62 started operating on November 15, 1971 under the nomenclature of Bus Route 4 between Eastpoint Mall and Dundalk, with southbound trips operating along North Point Road and Wise Avenue, and northbound trips operating along Merritt Boulevard. Another route identified as Route 4A operated briefly between Eastpoint and Logan Village between 1977 and 1978, but it was quickly eliminated. Predecessors Service along North Point Road prior to the existence of route 4 had previously been provided by the Baltimore Transit Company's Route H from 1925 to 1948 and Route 55 (no relationship to current Route 55 that runs from Towson to Fox Ridge) from 1948 to 1952, then by Dundalk Bus Lines. Service to Ft. Howard Veterans Hospital was added in 1973 after Route 4 absorbed Route 9, which had operated between 1971 and 1973. Ft. Howard had previously been served by streetcars. The no. 26 streetcar line had provided service to Ft. Howard. Service was replaced in 1952 by Dundalk Bus Lines. During this time it was known in the community as 'the blue bus' owing to the color of the buses and to differentiate them from the yellow buses of the Baltimore Transit Company's No. 10 and 20 routes. The no. 4 designation was used in the past for a line that operated in West Baltimore as a streetcar from 1894 to 1935 and as a bus line from 1935 to 1954. The service was then absorbed into Route 15, which still operates along that route to this day. Elimination of Ft. Howard service In 1993, Route 4 service to Ft. Howard, which had been cut in half less than a year earlier,MTA June 1992 schedule changes was eliminated completely, and service the remaining parts of the line was reduced to one bus every 70 minutes. The proposal to eliminate service to Ft. Howard drew protests that were filmed by local news stations. A private contractor was chartered to provide this service following elimination. In 1997, MTA once again started to run a bus to Ft. Howard. A new Route 6 that ran from Eastpoint Mall to Ft. Howard, mostly via North Point Road, was briefly added in 1997, but was discontinued a year later. Extension to White Marsh In 2000, MTA extended Route 4 from Eastpoint Mall to White Marsh Mall through Essex and Rosedale, and south from the Dundalk loop to Turner's Station, and the route was slightly modified to serve the CCBC Dundalk campus. For the first time, single-seat bus service became available between the two CCBC east-side campuses. This service initially operated through Essex along Mace Avenue, a street where buses were previously opposed by the community. As a result of community opposition, Route 4 was soon shifted to Rossville Boulevard, the same route as Route 55. In addition to these extensions, the frequency of service was improved. Rush hour service operated every 40 minutes, and off-peak service hourly. Selected trips also served the Yellow Brick Road industrial Park in Golden Ring. Service along the original part of the route remain unchanged. Northbound trips continued to follow the Merritt Boulevard corridor, while southbound trips used North Point Road and Wise Avenue, requiring riders to change buses on the same line to return to the area they originally left. Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative changes In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, Route 4 underwent a major overhaul. This included: *Shortening the north end of the route. Its original planned terminus was Franklin Square Hospital, but this was later changed to the CCBC Essex Campus in response to complaints of the loss of Route 35 service directly to the campus. Riders wishing to reach White Marsh were directed to transfer to Route 35. *Northbound trips were to be modified to operate via the southbound route of North Point Road and Wise Avenue. No bus service was provided in the Merritt Boulevard area, and riders wishing to reach this area were directed to walk up to a mile to Eastpoint Mall or Wise Avenue. *Trips via Yellow Brick Road Industrial Park were eliminated. MTA stated that only 11 riders used this branch daily, requiring of taxpayer subsidy of $5.28 each. In a schedule published in early 2006, a small number of these trips were reinstated. *Rush hour service was reduced to one bus an hour, which became the frequency at all times. Route 4 alternated buses with Route 24, providing more efficient service on both lines, until February 2009, when Route 24 was shortened. When a Route 4 bus reached the CCBC Essex campus, the next trip made by the vehicle was as Route 24, and vice versa. Middle River modification In February 2009, Route 4 was modified in the Middle River area to serve the corridor of Martin Boulevard that was previously served by the truncated Route 24. Route 24 was later extended in a different direction to Moravia. BaltimoreLink On June 18, 2017 as part of the BaltimoreLink transit system overhaul, Route 4 was replaced in its entirety by LocalLink 62.

In 1987, he earned the Sovereign Award for Champion 2-Year-Old Colt after winning the Summer Stakes, Cup and Saucer, Grey Stakes and Coronation Futurity, plus finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. At age three, he started his campaign on the American Triple Crown trail, where he finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby and sixth in the Preakness. He then returned to Canada where he finished second in the Queen's Plate and won the Prince of Wales, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Background Bred by Sam-Son Farm, he was by the highly successful sire Vice Regent and out of Sam- Son Farm's foundation mare No Class. In addition to Regal Classic, No Class produced champions Classy 'n' Smart, Grey Classic and Sky Classic. He was raced in partnership with Vice Regent's owner, Windfields Farm. Champion Two-Year-Old season Regal Classic was trained by Olympic Games equestrian Gold Medalist and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee Jim Day. Racing at age two, he dominated his opponents, winning every major stakes race for his age group. Sent to California for the 1987 Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Hollywood Park Racetrack, Regal Classic was in 11th place after a quarter mile, then moved up to seventh at the half before getting boxed in on the far turn. Under jockey Dave Penna, the colt made it through on the inside rail and came on with a strong stretch drive to pass race favorite Tejano and finish second to winner Success Express. His performances in 1987 earned Regal Classic the Sovereign Award as Canadian Champion 2-Yr-Old-Colt. At Three Regal Classic's arch rival was another Sam-Son Farm colt sired by Vice Regent named Regal Intention. Regal Classic had defeated him at age two in winning the important Coronation Futurity Stakes and in 1988, the three-year-old Regal Classic beat him again in the Prince of Wales Stakes and the Marine Stakes. Sent south to compete in the United States Triple Crown series, Regal Classic ran third in the Blue Grass Stakes prep, fifth in the Kentucky Derby, and sixth in the Preakness Stakes. He returned to Canada for the Canadian Triple Crown and won the Plate Trial Stakes prep, then finished second to Regal Intention in Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate. The two reversed positions in the Prince of Wales Stakes with Regal Classic earning the win. In the fall of 1988, Regal Classic finished second to Ballindaggin in the Molson Export Challenge Stakes. Regal Classic returned to racing at age four in 1989. His best results were a win in the Eclipse Handicap at Woodbine in Toronto and a second in the Ben Ali Handicap at Keeneland Race Course in Kentucky. Stud Duties Retired to stud duty, Regal Classic sired stakes winners Inish Glora, One Way Love, Classic Stamp, and Canadian Classic winners Regal Discovery and Stephanotis, as well as Australian millionaire runner Regal Roller. After standing at McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbreds, LLC in Saratoga Springs, New York, for several years, he was pensioned after the 2007 season. Death In early April 2012, he began experiencing colic symptoms that led to a vet emergency visit. The exam performed by the veterinarian indicated a large pulsing mass in the rectal area, and the ultrasound revealed bleeding. The determination made was that he could no longer be saved from extreme pain and suffering given his age and the malignant growth so he was humanely euthanized.

In 1988, it was adapted as an American horror/spanish film of the same name. In this book, carnivorous slugs go on a rampage. Synopsis Slugs in the cellar of an old house feed on scraps of rotten meat someone is unknowingly throwing down to them. A very drunk Ron Bell stumbles home, passes out in his front room and wakes to find himself being eaten alive by slugs that have come through the floor. The slugs then retreat back down the cellar. Mike Brady, an almost-40-year-old council health inspector awakes with wife Kim, 35, and discusses that he has to help evict a council tenant Ron Bell that day. Brady accompanies Archie Reece, bailiff, to serve an eviction notice on Ron Bell. They find Bell's mutilated body. The slugs leave Ron Bell's cellar, crawl up into his garden and then down into the sewers towards a new housing estate. Mary Forbes, housewife, discovers slug larvae in her hanging baskets. Brady, on a routine check of the houses on the new housing estate finds slime trails. Bert Crossley, a butcher on the new housing estate enjoys a lunch time drink with friends Danny and Tony. On arriving back at his shop afterwards, he discovers the meat he had left in cabinets has vanished, only a few scraps and dark patches of blood remain. Julie Jenkins, receptionist for the council offices where Brady works, takes a message from pensioner Mrs. Fortune, complaining about her blocked drain and toilet. Brady and effluent operative Don Palmer from the council sewage department go to investigate. They find the drain blocked and slime trails but when they examine the sewer they find nothing wrong. They do not see two slugs hidden in the darkness. Carol Wilton leaves her four-year-old son Paul in the garden to buy some bread and milk, while he sits and watches slugs eat his rabbit. Harold Morris, keen gardener, puts on a garden glove that has slugs in some of the fingers. They eat most of his hand by the time Harold, assisted by his wife Jean manage to cut it off with shears and a trowel. Mike Brady and his wife Kim are doing some gardening when Brady is attacked by slugs who try to bite his hand. He manages to put three of the slugs into a jar. Mike and Kim take the captured slugs to Merton Museum for advice. Museum curator John Foley examines the slugs but tells them he is no expert. Brady asks Foley if he thinks slugs could kill a man. He puts a pond snail in a tray with a slug and the slug immediately eats the snail. Brady goes to a garden centre and buys a bottle of slug poison and some slug pellets. He puts them down in his garden. Kath Green leaves her two-year-old daughter Amanda playing with her dolls in her conservatory to buy the little girl an ice cream. In her mother's absence, Amanda finds a slime trail, puts her hand in it and licks it off. Later that night, Kath rushes into Amanda's bedroom to find her convulsing on the bed. In a wild frenzy, Amanda bites her Mum's neck who then falls downstairs bleeding to death. Ray Green returns home from work to find both his wife and daughter dead. Brady goes to see if the poison has done its job, but although some of the pellets have gone, the slugs are still there. Computer firm rep David Watson and his wife Maureen sit down to Sunday lunch. David eats half a slug which was hidden in some lettuce. He goes to bed that night with a terrible stomach ache and awakes with a very bad headache. At a business lunch that day in the City Hotel, David Watson tries to secure a new contract with Edward Canning and Kenneth Riggs. David is overcome by a terrible headache until finally blood gushes from one of his nostrils and a long white worm slithers out of it. David falls onto a table dying as another slug bursts out of one of his eyes. A waiter from the restaurant calls the Local Health Inspector. Brady investigates the sickening scene and finds the worms lying dead next to Watson's body. He takes them to the museum for Foley to look at. Foley tells Brady that he has been reading up on the slugs and after dissecting and doing tests, he says that they are a hybrid of the ordinary garden variety. The white worms are \\"schistosomes,\\" a parasite found in the blood stream of slugs. If ingested by humans they cause the often fatal disease Schistomiasis. Foley tells Brady that he will start work on making a poison. Bobby Talbot, 18, and Donna Moss, 17, are having sex in Donna's parents' bedroom while they are out. Slugs make their way through the garden, into the drain, up the drain pipe, along the guttering, down onto a window sill and drop onto the floor of the bedroom. Donna is killed first as the slugs crawl inside her. Bobby, also being eaten alive jumps from the bedroom window straight onto a cold frame below and is killed by a shard of glass. Brady returns home and tells Kim about the days events at the City Hotel. He explains what Foley told him, adding that he thinks slugs killed Ron Bell. Kim goes into the kitchen to find six slugs which have crawled out of a tap. Brady kills them all but realises the slugs are in the water supply and will be all over Merton. Gravedigger Charlie Barnes digs up a grave during the night to rob the occupants valuables, but is eaten alive by slugs when he falls in. Brady calls his G.P. Dr. Warwick at his surgery to see if he has had any unusual cases. The doctor tells him he has had nine complaints so far of nausea, headaches, sensitivity to light, diarrhoea, fever and vomiting. Brady explains that he thinks the water is contaminated, and Warwick says that there is a species of snail that spreads a disease called Bilharzia, but that disease is confined to Africa and Asia. Brady goes to see Merton's Water Board Inspector Frank Phillips and explains to him what has happened, asking him to turn the water supply off. Phillips laughs and refuses. Brady spots an article in a local newspaper saying that police are baffled about three mysterious deaths. He returns to his office to find that Foley has left a message with Julie. Brady goes to see Foley at the museum. He has developed a liquid that kills slugs on contact. However, it explodes when it touches moisture so they talk to Don Palmer about how to get it into the sewer system. The plan is for Brady and Palmer to go down into the sewer by Ron Bell's house and act as bait, luring the slugs into a central chamber, while Foley waits above ground and releases the poison. Brady and Palmer climb into Ron Bell's house through a broken window and go down into the cellar where they find hundreds of slugs on the floor. They empty a can of petrol into the cellar, ignite it then leave the house. Equipped with overalls, masks, oxygen tanks and two-way radios, Brady and Palmer and go down into the sewer via a manhole cover outside the house. Brady and Palmer test their radios, then begin searching the central chambers of the sewers for the slugs' nest. Foley follows them in above his car. They find the slugs, but become trapped when they cannot remove a grille from a chamber. Brady eventually removes the grille but Palmer is eaten by the slugs in the meantime. Foley drives to the manhole cover where Brady can escape but the cover is jammed shut. Using a rope tied to his car he manages to remove the manhole cover, just before Brady's oxygen supply runs out. Both men tip the 5 gallon drum of poison down into the sewer which sets off a chain reaction sweeping through the entire Merton sewer system. Farmer George Thomas from Merton, drives to London's Covent Garden to deliver some vegetables to a buyer. The buyer searches through the vegetables, throwing the rotten ones into a pile. In amongst some rotten lettuces are some slugs' eggs...

Cut by the Santa Cruz extension of the urban passenger rail network of the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, it has a very diverse landscape, with commercial areas, residential and industrial. The neighborhood of Santa Cruz is the seat of the administrative region of Santa Cruz, comprising the neighborhoods of Santa Cruz, Paci√™ncia and Sepetiba. The administrative region, in turn, belongs to the West Zone subprefecture. Since the installation of Itagua√≠ Port, is a rapidly developing neighborhood. It is 445 years old, and has important preserved monuments. But it is a place of contrasts. It is one of the most populated districts, and at the same time, due to its vast land area, one of the least densely populated; has an industrial district, but in its landscape still rules many unexplored areas. Its HDI in 2000 was 0.742, the 119 placed in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, among 126 areas analyzed. Etymology As stated in the rare work History of the Imperial Farm of Santa Cruz, published by Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute, by Jose de Saldanha da Gama, who was one of the overseers of the farm in 1860, the Jesuits placed a large wooden cross, painted in black, seated on a stone base supported by a granite pillar. The cross gave his name to Santa Cruz on December 30, 1567. During the Brazilian Empire, the cross was replaced by another of smaller dimensions. The cross that in now there is a replica built by the Brazilian Army .  History   Background  Before the arrival of Europeans in America, the region known today as Santa Cruz was populated by people of the village's language family, Tupi‚ÄìGuarani, who called the place of Spawning (fish too). After the discovery of Brazil, with the arrival of Portuguese colonists to the Guanabara Bay, a vast area of lowlands of Santa Cruz and the surrounding mountains, was donated to Crist√≥v√£o Monteiro, the Captaincy of S√£o Vicente by Martim Afonso de Sousa in January 1567, as a reward for services rendered during the military expedition that finally drove the French out of Guanabara. So he built shortly after a sugar mill and a chapel in a location known as Curral Falso, beginning the settlement of land by the Portuguese.  Companhia de Jesus  Headquarters of the Old Farm of the Royal and Imperial Santa Cruz Palace. With the death of the owner of the land, his wife, Mrs. Marquesa Ferreira, donated to the priests of the Companhia de Jesus a part of the lands of Crist√≥v√£o played it. These religious, by gathering these lands to other land grants, were an immense plantation marked by a large wooden cross: the Holy Cross. In a few decades, the region between Barra de Guaratiba, the current city of Mangaratiba, to Vassouras, in the south of the current state of Rio de Janeiro, was part of the powerful Finance from Santa Cruz, the most developed of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro this time with thousands of slaves, livestock, and various types of crops, managed with advanced techniques for the season. Among the buildings today with historic value include churches and a convent, both richly decorated. One of these surviving works is called the Guandu Bridge or Bridge of the Jesuits. In fact a bridge-dam, which was erected in 1752, in order to adjust the volume of flood waters from the Guandu River. Currently, this monument remains with its original structure almost unchanged, with a heritage, artistic and architectural tumbled by IPHAN. Another initiative of the leaders of Santa Cruz Farm, in terms of culture, was the foundation of a music school, an orchestra and choir, built by slaves, who played and sang at mass and in festivities, either on the farm or in the capital of the Captaincy. It is, therefore, that Santa Cruz was the birthplace of the organization's first instrumental and choral music conservatory in Brazil. Passes through the cow lands of Santa Cruz in the trail that linked the colonial city of Sao Sebastiao do Rio de Janeiro to the interior: the Way of the Jesuits, later called The Way of Mines, and later still, the Royal Road to Santa Cruz. His route lay to the port of Sepetiba, where he embarked to the city of Paraty, where the former was leaving the Royal Road. Before the expulsion of the Jesuits of the areas of Portugal and its colonies in 1759 by action of the Marqu√™s de Pombal, the assets of the Companhia de Jesus (Finance and Santa Cruz) reverted to the Crown.  The Royal Family  With the banishment of the Jesuits in Brazil, the assets of Farm Santa Cruz went on to make the Viceroys. After a period of administrative difficulties, under the government of Viceroy Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos e Sousa, the farm again experienced a period of prosperity. At the beginning of the 19th century with the arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil (1808) and its establishment in Rio de Janeiro, the farm was chosen as a vacation spot. Thus, the former convent has been adapted to the functions of space real - Royal Palace of Santa Cruz. Feeling comfortable in the Royal Treasury of Santa Cruz, the Prince Regent prolonged his stay for several months, shipping, promoting public hearings and approvals from the same. It grew up and were educated princes Don Pedro and Dom Miguel. On the initiative of the Portuguese sovereign were brought from China about a hundred men in charge of cultivating tea, the site now known as Morro do Ch√°. For almost a century this activity has been productive and attracted the interest of technical and visitors, as the pioneer its implementation in Brazil. The tea harvested in Santa Cruz was excellent and, therefore, its production was fully sold. On July 15 of 1818 was founded the village of S√£o Francisco Xavier de Itagua√≠, which Santa Cruz becomes an end. Jo√£o VI said goodbye to Santa Cruz in 1820, to return to the metropolis.  The First Reign  Emperor in the gazebo, watching the scenery of Finance of Santa Cruz. After the return of Jo√£o VI of Portugal, the Prince Regent, Dom Pedro, continued constantly present in Santa Cruz, passing his honeymoon with the Empress Leopoldina (1818) on this farm, transforming the Royal Palace in the Imperial Palace. In the context of the Independence of Brazil, before starting the historic voyage of Independence, the Prince Regent stopped in Santa Cruz, where there was a meeting on August 15 of 1822, with the presence of Jos√© Bonif√°cio, to establish their bases. Upon his return, before heading to the city, celebrated the independence of Brazil on the farm. The Second Reign Princess Isabel's Palace Dom Pedro I, abdicated the throne, but his sons continued to maintain a constant presence in the Imperial Treasury of Santa Cruz. Early on, Dom Pedro II and promoted the princesses crowded balls and soirees at the Imperial Palace. It should also be noted that throughout the period between 1808 and 1889, Santa Cruz was one of the city of Rio with its landscapes portrayed by foreign travelers as the French Jean-Baptiste Debret, the Austrian Thomas Ender, the English Mary Graham and others. The picture that serves as the illustration for this text is an example, being written by the Belgian painter Benjamin Mary, who was the first ambassador of Belgium in Brazil, painted in November 1837. The figure is documentary evidence that the viewpoint of Santa Cruz was a visiting place for the emperors, in which you can see beyond the old Imperial Palace, Dom Pedro II with only 14 years old enjoying the view from the farm. In the year 1833 the parsonage National Treasury of Santa Cruz has been shut down by decree the end of the village of Itagua√≠ and became the end of the city of Rio de Janeiro, taking into account the wishes of local people. In Santa Cruz the law was signed by Princess Isabel who gave emancipation to all slaves of the Imperial Government. The enactment of the law was attended by distinguished guests such as the Viscount of Rio Branco and the Conde d'Eu. Santa Cruz, a political- economic position, and especially strategic (facing the sea and back into the paths of the backlands of Minas) was one of the first places in the country to benefit from the system of home delivery of letters by mail. On November 22 of 1842 opened the first branch of the Post Office in Brazil to adopt this service. It was also the site chosen by the emperor to install the first telephone line from South America, between the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o and Santa Cruz. In 1878 was inaugurated the train station and at the end of 1881, D. Pedro II inaugurated the Slaughterhouse Santa Cruz, known as the most modern in the world at the time, which was served by an extension of the railroad and supplied meat the whole city of Rio de Janeiro. Also, due to the generator which served the slaughter, Santa Cruz was the first district of the suburb to have electric lighting. D. Pedro II also launched the first phone of Finance. Gradually, Santa Cruz was transformed, with palaces, solar, shops, streets and parks. Weathering the weather and the criminal actions of men, many of these places are still standing, attesting to the importance of this historic neighborhood. The Palace Princess Isabel, the Marco Onze, the Wallace Fountain, The Zeppelin Hangar and many others, are examples.  Republic  Santa Cruz AFB Hangar's South Door.

But solved some problems, soon attracted foreign immigrants, who contributed greatly to the economy of the neighborhood. The Arabs and the Italians were responsible for the expansion of local commerce, and the development of Japanese agriculture. During the government Get√∫lio Vargas in the 1930s, the region of Santa Cruz has undergone profound changes, with sanitation projects that aimed for recovery of land, with the recovery of health and economic dynamism, from the creation of agricultural colonies.

The production was so great that supplied the whole city of Rio de Janeiro, giving Santa Cruz the title \\"breadbasket\\" of the Federal District. At the time was still built in the region, a hangar for dirigible Zeppelin, the Zeppelin Hangar. The building is listed by the Institute for National Artistic and Historical Heritage (IPHAN) since 1998, receiving the subscription tipping No. 550. With the intensive development of Rio de Janeiro, occurring in all directions, was inaugurated in 1975, the Industrial Zone, strongly promoting the urbanization of the neighborhood.

But in 2003, it was reduced to one bus every 34 minutes. The line operates on portions of the route also covered by routes 22 and 27, but connects to various points of interest in the Hampden area, and to the Woodberry Light Rail Stop. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region's transit system, it was initially proposed that the Hampden Shuttle would be completely eliminated due to low ridership and a heavy cost to taxpayers. This was a plan that seriously worried the area's residents. However, after community meetings, it was ultimately decided that it would continue operating with no schedule change. In 2006, MTA proposed that the routing would shift from Falls Road to Roland Avenue in order to replace service that would be discontinued on a portion of Route 27.

Routes 28 and 37 had served the Liberty Heights corridor since 1947. The main bus line serving Liberty Heights Avenue in both directions was Route 28. Route 28 had operated since 1947 between the Liberty Heights Avenue corridor and Cherry Hill with other destinations. All buses that had operated from Cherry Hill and other locations in South Baltimore to Liberty Heights had been given the no. 28 designation. All buses that originated from Liberty Heights with a destination other than Cherry Hill were identified as no. 28. But all buses that originated in the Liberty Heights area and had a final destination of Cherry Hill were designated no. 37. This was done to alert white residents of the communities in the Liberty Heights area that the bus's final destination was Cherry Hill, then a low class black community.Woodholme By DeWayne Wickham, pages 84‚Äì85 This practice was discontinued in 1974 when the no. 37 designation was dropped, and all buses along this route were given the no. 28 designation.Routes of Baltimore Transit ‚Äì 1900 to Today .

When Route M-1 began in 1984, it operated along its present route, though it has undergone various changes before resuming its original route. In 1988, Route M-1 was combined with Route M-13, and selected trips were extended along Milford Mill Road to Milford Mill Station. In addition, other trips operated between the Milford Mill Station and a community off Scotts Level Road in Pikesville known as \\"Bellemore Farms\\" (also previously a branch of Route M-13). The line continued following this route for the next 15 years, with the only change being the addition of Sunday service in 2001, when Sunday service was introduced on all M-lines.

The line currently runs from the Rogers Avenue Metro Subway Station in Northwest Baltimore to Security Square Mall, with selected trips to the Social Security Administration headquarters in Woodlawn. The line serves the corridor of Gwynn Oak Avenue and the communities of Howard Park, Gwynn Oak, and Windsor Mill. The route is the successor to the 32 Woodlawn and 33 West Arlington streetcar lines and several bus routes.http://www.btco.net/Routes/map32Wood.gif History Route 57 started operating under the Route R-3 designation on June 18, 1984.http://www.btco.net/Routes/routemet.htm Prior to 1984, the area had been served by other bus and streetcar lines, most recently Route 28, which had branches feeding into Liberty Heights Avenue and then operating through Downtown Baltimore mostly to Cherry Hill. These services operated on Sundays until 2001, when Route M-6 started operating on Sundays. The line has only had minor routing and schedule changes since its 1984 introduction, with the exception of two redesignations (in 1987 from R-3 to M-6 and in 2009 from M-6 to 57) and a controversial elimination in 2005 that was later reversed.  Origin  Streetcar service began on the Gwynn Oak corridor in 1924 with the initiation of the No. 33 Streetcar line, which operated as a branch of the No. 5 Streetcar line into Gwynn Oak Junction.Baltimore Streetcars By Herbert H. Harwood, Paul W. Wirtz, p71-73, This service was suspended briefly in 1930 in favor of a bus designated no. 20, bus streetcar service resumed later that same year. The no. 33 streetcar line was discontinued when the no. 5 streetcar ended its service in 1948. But service along Gwynn Oak would continue to operate as branches of the No. 32 Streetcar, which became the Bus Route 32 in 1955. Bus Route 32 would become part of Bus Routes 28 and 37 in 1959. Routes 28 and 37 had served Liberty Heights Avenue since 1947. The main bus line serving Liberty Heights in both directions was Route 28. While Route 28 operated in both directions, buses that had a final destination of Cherry Hill were designated no. 37. This was done to alert white residents of the communities in the Liberty Heights area that the bus's final destination was Cherry Hill, then a low class black community.Woodholme By DeWayne Wickham, pages 84-85 This practice was discontinued in 1974 when the no. 37 designation was dropped, and all buses along this route were given the no. 28 designation. When Route 37 became a part of Route 28, it would continue to serve the Gwynn Oak area full-time until 1984. During this time, it would undergo extensions to Social Security and Security Square Mall following development of the Woodlawn area. Route 28 would continue to serve the Gwynn Oak area outside of Metro's hours of operation until 2001. Route 28 had three branches: one to Randallstown, one to various points on Security Boulevard, and one to Belvedere and Belvieu. These covered most of the route of Route M-6 when Route M-6 did not operate. In 1996, Route 28 converted into a Sunday only service. The Belvedere and Belvieu branch was discontinued, and service on the other branches was increased. Other parts of route 28 were absorbed by existing parts or modifications to other lines.MTA Winter 1996 schedule changes In September 2001, Route 28 was completely discontinued when Metro connection services were introduced on Sunday. Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative In October 2005, MTA completely eliminated Route M-6 from service. All trips on Route 44 were extended to either Security Square Mall or Social Security to replace the service. It was noted in literature produced by MTA that \\"service on Route M-6 was to be provided by Route 44.\\" But this was not how riders and community activists viewed the change.https://www.latimes.com/bal- md.buses25oct25,0,3723611.story?page=1http://www.courant.com/news/local/bal- md.buses25oct25,0,6419125.story The elimination of Route M-6 was criticized as follows: *Route 44 takes a slightly different route from Route M-6. Though this route is more direct while traveling to the Woodlawn area, it does not serve various side streets in the Howard Park community of Northwest Baltimore, an area populated by many senior citizens. These elderly residents were forced to walk several blocks in order to reach a bus line, one that operates in a very different direction. *Route 44 is a long route, running for about an hour prior to reaching the Rogers Avenue Metro Subway Station. The service is far less reliable when attempting to reach the Security area from the Metro subway. *Fewer trips were provided on Route 44 than were provided by Route M-6, especially during evenings and weekends. Also, Route 44 was overcrowded at these points. In the weeks immediately following the elimination, community activists and delegates were told by MTA that Route M-6 service would not be restored, despite these complaints. MTA stated that Route 44 provided sufficient service, and only a small percentage of riders were negatively affected. In March 2006, under extreme pressure from the community, MTA restored eight round trips on weekdays to Route M-6. MTA stated that this act was a compromise in exchange for hushing all other complaints against MTA in reference to this and other recent and planned changes in route. But rider advocates were not satisfied. These trips operated hourly during peak hours only. Activists continued to put pressure on MTA. In October 2006, exactly 50 weeks after its original elimination, full-time service was restored on Route M-6. This took place at a time when officials were facing re-election. This change did not help the outgoing administration win re-election, but it did restore the line to its full-time, 7-day-a-week status.Michael Dresser, Baltimore Sun, Northwest Baltimore bus route to return, October 6, 2006 Topic Galleries - baltimoresun.com On August 30, Route M-6 was redesignated Route 57.

During the time of the Black Death which arrived in Siena in May 1348, Nicoluccia and all five children died. Agnolo di Tura survived the Black Death and remarried.

State Route 313 (SR 313, OH 313) is a long east-west state highway located in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The western terminus of SR 313 is at a T-intersection with SR 146 approximately northwest of the village of Cumberland. Its eastern terminus is near the eastern end of Senecaville Lake at a T-intersection with SR 147 nearly southwest of Batesville. Route description Along its path, SR 313 travels through eastern Muskingum County, southern Guernsey County and northeastern Noble County. No segment of SR 313 is included as a portion of the National Highway System. History The SR 313 designation was applied in 1932. When it was established, SR 313 existed only along the current alignment of the highway between its eastern junction with SR 83, at the time known as SR 76, southeast of New Concord and its intersection with SR 821, then a portion of US 21, north of Pleasant City. In 1935, SR 313 was extended east to a new terminus at SR 285 in Senecaville. Two years later, the highway was extended on the west end to its current western terminus at SR 146. SR 313 would be extended on the east end again in 1947. This extension followed the present alignment of the route along the north side of Senecaville Lake to a new eastern terminus at what is now the intersection that marks the southern terminus of SR 761. Then, it was designated as SR 670, which utilized the current easternmost stretch of SR 313 and the entirety of SR 761. It would be until 1974 before SR 313 took on the shape it has today when the SR 670 designation was removed from the state highway system due to the construction of Interstate 670 (I-670) in Columbus. Consequently, SR 313 was extended to its present eastern terminus at SR 147 over the previous southern stretch of SR 670, while the remainder of the former SR 670 north of SR 313 became SR 761.

As propraetor in 88 B.C., he refused Marius and his followers asylum in Africa.Plutarch, Marius 40.3‚Äì4; Appian, Bellum civile 1.62 as Œ£Œ≠ŒæœÉœÑŒπŒøœÇ; Varro, De re rustica 1.1.10 with the title praetor; T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2 (New York 1952), pp. 41, 49, 620. Marius in Africa Plutarch presents a highly colored version of how Sextilius rejected Marius and furnishes a moral:See T.F. Carney, \\"The Flight and Exile of Marius,\\" Greece & Rome 8 (1961) 98‚Äì121: \\"It must occur to anyone who reads Plutarch's account of Marius' flight and exile to wonder how much of this thrilling and romantic tale is historically true.\\" Little is known of this Sextilius. It is likely that he belonged to the senatorial family of Sextilii who used the praenomen Publius, among them a 2nd-century B.C. praetor from whom a letter fragment survives.E. Badian, ‚ÄúA fundus at Fundi,‚Äù American Journal of Philology 101 (1980), p. 111; D.R. Shackleton Bailey, ‚ÄúThe Roman Nobility in the Second Civil War,‚Äù Classical Quarterly 10 (1960), p. 263, note 1. At one time, numismatic evidence was interpreted as referring to Sextilius as praetor and propraetor, but the coin has since been determined to belong to the Augustan period.See discussion in T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2 (New York 1952), p. 45, note 4. Before the arrival of Marius in Africa, Sextilius had taken a neutral position in the civil war. He had allowed some of Marius's allies to join up with Hiempsal II, king of Numidia, who at that time was attempting to gain the confidence of the Marians while acting on behalf of Sulla. If Sextilius had been serious about carrying out his threat to treat Marius as a public enemy ‚Äî a senatorial decree which sanctioned his execution at sight ‚Äî he most likely would have allowed Marius to enter the country rather than warning him off. The difficulty of Sextilius's position is indicated by the consequences of his action: since no further public office for him is known, he evidently pleased neither side in the conflict.T.F. Carney, \\"The Flight and Exile of Marius,\\" Greece & Rome 8 (1961), pp. 113‚Äì114. Carney argues that both Hiempsal and Sextilius were attempting to maintain the appearance of complying with the senatorial decree while taking no direct action against Marius. Date of praetorship Cicero writesCicero, De finibus 2.55 of a P. Sextilius RufusOn the cognomen and voting tribe of P. Sextilius, see T.P. Wiseman, New Men in the Roman Senate (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 261. who claimed he was bound by his oath of office to follow the Lex Voconia in depriving a young woman of her inheritance. E. Badian has argued that this was the P. Sextilius who became governor of Africa and dates his praetorship to 92.Broughton had dated the praetorship to 89 or 88 in MRR2 (1952); in vol. 3 (1986), p. 198, he prefers Badian's argument from Journal of Roman Studies 55 (1965), p. 113. Literary interests There is some indication that Publius Sextilius took an interest in or was a patron of literature. When Cassius Dionysius of Utica translated the great agricultural treatise of Mago the Carthaginian into Greek, he dedicated his translation to Sextilius.Varro, De re rustica 1.1.10; Robert E.A.

The actual term \\"orienteering\\" was first used in 1886 at the Swedish Military Academy Karlberg and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass. The competitive sport began when the first competition was held for Swedish military officers on 28 May 1893 at the yearly games of the Stockholm garrison. The first civilian competition, in Norway on 31 October 1897, was sponsored by the Tjalve Sports Club and held near Oslo. The course was long by modern standards, at 19.5 km, on which only three controls were placed. The competition was won by Peder Fossum in a time of 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 7 seconds. Europe between the two world wars At the end of World War I the first large scale orienteering meet was organized in 1918 by Major Ernst Killander of Stockholm, Sweden. Then President of the Stockholm Amateur Athletic Association, Killander was a Scouting Movement leader who saw orienteering as an opportunity to interest youth in athletics. The meet was held south of Stockholm in 1919 and was attended by 220 athletes. Killander is credited with coining the Swedish word orientering, from which the word orienteering is derived, in publicity materials for this meet. Killander continued to develop the rules and principles of the sport, and today is widely regarded throughout Scandinavia as the \\"Father of Orienteering\\". Protractor compass, first introduced in Sweden in 1933. The sport gained popularity with the development of more reliable compasses in the 1930s. The first international competition between orienteers of Sweden and Norway was held outside Oslo, Norway, in 1932. In 1933, the Swedish compass manufacturer Silva Sweden AB introduced a new compass design, the protractor compass. Until the introduction of the thumb compass, the protractor compass would remain the state of the art in the sport. By 1934, over a quarter million Swedes were actively participating in the sport, and orienteering had spread to Finland, Switzerland, the Soviet Union and Hungary. The nations of Finland, Norway and Sweden all established national championships.Palmer, Peter (1997). The Complete Orienteering Manual. Wiltshire, England: The Crowood Press Ltd., , p. 20. The Swedish national orienteering society, Svenska Orienteringsf√∂rbundet, the first national orienteering society, was founded in 1936. Spread beyond Europe after World War II Following World War II, orienteering spread throughout Europe, and to North America, Oceania, and Asia. This spread was due in part to post-war travel by European orienteers, therefore more military people were using orienteering as part of a training method. In North America, the first orienteering event took place in the United States, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, in November 1941. It was organized by Piltti Heiskanen, a visiting teacher from Finland. Swedish orienteer and business man Bjorn Kjellstr√∂m, who moved to the United States in 1946, had a major influence on the sport there. In 1967, Norwegian Harald Wibye founded the first U.S. orienteering club, the Delaware Valley Orienteering Association, which 30 years later was the largest orienteering club in the United States. In 1971, a group of orienteers led by members of the then four-year-old Quantico Orienteering Club founded the United States Orienteering Federation. The Canadian Orienteering Federation was founded in 1967, and the first Canadian national orienteering championship was held at Gatineau Park in Ottawa on August 10, 1968. The only World Championship to be held in North America took place at Harriman State Park, New York, USA, in 1993. In Australia, the first orienteering event was held in 1955. Establishment as a world sport The first international governing body for orienteering was the International Orienteering Federation, which was formed by Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East Germany, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and West Germany in 1961. Eleven countries sent representatives to an international conference in Sandviken, Sweden, in 1949 that aimed to bring more consistent rules and mapping standards to the sport. The Norwegians and Swedes began producing new multi-color maps with cartography designed specifically for orienteering, in the 1950s. The International Orienteering Federation (IOF) was established in 1961 and the first world championships were held in 1966. The founding member societies represented the nations of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. By 1969, the IOF would represent 16 countries, including the first two non- European member societies representing Japan and Canada. Eighty different national orienteering federations are member societies of the IOF today. World championships were held biannually from 1961 to 2003, and are now held every year.

Pre-Zero Hour In the original pre-Zero Hour continuity, veteran Legionnaire Colossal Boy (Gim Allon) was finally able to act upon his unrequited feelings for his teammate Shrinking Violet when the two apparently became a romantic couple. The relationship developed fairly quickly, and the two were soon married. The pairing was a surprise to almost everyone, as she had been previously linked with Duplicate Boy, a member of the Heroes of Lallor and one of the most powerful beings of the 30th century. When Duplicate Boy learned of the relationship, he tracked the couple down and proceeded to beat Colossal Boy mercilessly until he realized what no one else had yet deduced: the woman involved with Colossal Boy was not Shrinking Violet.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #298 (April 1983) In reality, Shrinking Violet had been kidnapped by radicals from her native planet Imsk. She was replaced in the Legion by Yera, a Durlan actress who used her native shapeshifting abilities to assume Violet's identity and mimic her shrinking powers. Yera was an unwitting pawn in the plot, as the radicals had told her that Violet wished to go on a secret vacation.The real Shrinking Violet was taken captive and Yera was duped into taking her place sometime after Violet's participation in the Legion's successful efforts to protect Nullport from Khundian sabotage efforts in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #285 (March 1982), yet immediately prior to \\"Violet\\" joining the Legion Espionage Squad assembled by Chameleon Boy to spy on Khundia in the following issue.

History Entrance to the remains of the Palace of Bishnupur Kings The gharana originated in Bishnupur, West Bengal, India in the late 18th century with its roots dating back to the 13th-14th centuries CE. The name of the town means \\"city of Vishnu\\" in Bengali. In the ancient past, this area, known as Mallabhum was the abode of Malla Kings who were vassals to the Mughal Empire and were devotees of Vishnu and patrons of music. Historians suggest that 'Mallabhum' had once been the cultural centre of Eastern India. It also has the distinction of being the only vocal gharana in West Bengal. In the 17th century, during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb, many musicians moved to the court of the Maharaja of Bishnupur who was a known patron of the arts. The dhrupad singer Bahadur Khan of the Senia gharana, descendant of Tansen, fled to Bishnupur and made his gharana popular and sought refuge in the court. Bahadur Khan was not only a vocalist but could also play the Veena, the rabab, and the surshringar. The king, Raghunath Singh Deo II, accepted him as a court singer. In time, a good number of students became the disciples of Bahadur Khan. Historical evidence points to Ramasharan Bhattacharya, a disciple of Bahadur Khan as the founder of the gharana. Bishnupur Gharana therefore has a strong link to Betiya Gharana through this unbroken relationship. However, this view is contradicted by some historians, who claim that Bahadur Khan could not have attended the Durbar of King Raghunath Singh Deo II because of anachronism, as there is a gap of at least 50 years (2 generations) between them. In practice, Bishnupur Gharana has got some characteristic features in the improvisations of some Ragas which are diffetrent from the practice of the Betiya school of the Seniya gharana. Bharatiya Sangite Gharanar Itihas. Dilipkumar Mukhopadhyaya. Published by A. Mukherjee & Sons. Calcutta In the later part of the eighteenth century and towards the early and mid-nineteenth century, when music of different 'Gharanas' were gradually assimilating around the khyal style, the dhrupad style continued flourishing among the musicians of Bishnupur. In 1921 when Prince Edward came to visit India, six artists of various gharanas were chosen to perform six Ragas for six Seasons. Three of them were from Bishnupur Gharana: Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay, Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay and Kshetra Mohan Goswami. First maiden Gramophone record in Khayal in 1902 \\" Tara Parameshwari \\" by Lal Chand Baral, who learnt under Ramprassanna Bandyopadhyay (Vide Sangeet Chandrika) published by Gramophone Concert and Nicole. The first dhrupad record, in 1902, featured the song \\"Naad Bidya Sabse Sera\\", Raag Darbari, Taal Choutal, by Surendranath Bandyopadhyay, and was published by Gramophone Concert. In 2019, the grandson of Sangeetacharya Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay and the son of Sangeetacharya Amiya Ranjan Bandyopadhyay, Pandit Santanu Bandyopadhyay's research paper on Vocal Science published through Oxford Publishers. Style of singing and Ragas In this style, the artist elaborates on the raga through the alap in a simple fashion, devoid of ornamentation. It is free from intricate play with the rhythm. Layakari is however allowed in Dhamar, another form of vocalisation. The khyal of the Bishnupur gharana is noted for its sweet, lilting melody. It is adorned with the usual ornaments, which add variety to the melodic presentation of the raga. Its origins and development have led to a great openness in the teaching and evolution within this gharana. This gharana has the ragas , many of them are now very popular by their name, but their notes and chalans are different. For example this gharana's Purvi, Sohini, Shyam, Bibhas and many many more ragas with popular names have different notes and chalans. The Sohini, Purvi, Bibhas, Shyam , used by Rabindranath Tagore, are from this gharana. Because, his gurus-Jadu Bhatta, Bishnu Chakraborty belonged to this gharana.

Indeed, the club have never fielded more players in any season since, despite having played as many as twenty league games more in over fifty subsequent seasons. So inconsistent was their team selection that at no time did the above combination actually take the field.

He teamed up with William Douglas (of Douglas Motorcycles to develop new prototype motorcycles under the name Williamson-Douglas and employed Billy's brother Harold as a test rider. Douglas had been developing a 964 cc water-cooled flat twin engine that could be used either for light cars or motorcycles. Billy Williamson fitted this engine into a frame with Douglas- Druid girder forks and a Douglas two-speed gearbox and a foot-operated clutch which was launched in 1912 at a cost of ¬£82. In 1913 an air-cooled version was added to the range and in 1914 a kick starter was added. Production was halted by World War I and in 1919 the only engines available were JAP 980 cc air- cooled side valves, so Williamson redesigned the frame to fit. Unfortunately Billy Williamson suffered a fatal heart attack in 1920 after only twenty motorcycles had been produced.

Gurevich's work was informed by Jacques Le Goff and Georges Duby, and he considered himself a member of their Annales School. He was also influenced by ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin, challenging some of them at the same time. Gurevich's work was considered anti-Marxist and met with hostility in the Soviet Union, but enjoyed support abroad among the Annales School, although he was not allowed to travel abroad before Perestroika. Life and career Aron Gurevich was born in Moscow on May 12, 1924 to a secular Jewish family. In 1946 he graduated from the Moscow State University. He initially specialized in Scandinavian languages. In 1950 after defending his dissertation Peasantry of South-Eastern England during the pre- Norman period he became a Candidate of Sciences and a lecturer of Kalinin State Pedagogical Institute (now Tver State University), a provincial posting he was relegated to, and which he held from 1950 until 1964.Yelena Mazour- Matuseviƒç, ',' in Yelena Mazour-Matuseviƒç, Alexandra Schecket Korros (eds.), Saluting Aron Gurevich: Essays in History, Literature and Other Related Subjects, BRILL 2010 p.xiii. In 1962 Gurevich received a Doktor nauk degree at Leningrad University. His doctoral thesis was Overview of Norway's social history in IX-XII centuries. It was the first doctoral thesis in Soviet Union completely dedicated to Viking history. His career would suffer notably from the fact that he was Jewish, something that spelled considerable difficulties for scholars within the Soviet Union at that time.Harbana Mukh√≠a, 'Aron Gurevich:A View from India', in Yelena Mazour-Matuseviƒç,'Saluting Aron Gurevich: Essays in History, Literature and Other Related Subjects, 'in Alexandra Schecket Korros (eds.), Saluting Aron Gurevich: Essays in History, Literature and Other Related Subjects, BRILL 2010 pp.1-10, p.3. Aron Gurevich returned to Kalinin and became a professor in 1963. In 1966 Gurevich joined Moscow Institute of Philosophy, but he was fired after publishing Problems in the Origins of Feudalism in Western Europe (Problemy genezisa feodalizma v zapadnoi Evrope(1970)), where he contested the theory on origins of feudalism adopted in Marxist historiography, and was denounced for his employment of structuralist methods. Thereafter on he was barred from academic teaching. He was employed in the Information Department of the Institute for World History in Moscow until 1992.J√°nos M.

Previously, Port Covington was a railroad terminal built by the Western Maryland Railway in 1904 on the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. The terminal facilities included coal, grain and merchandise piers, overhead cranes, 11 rail yards, warehouses, a roundhouse, a turntable and a machine shop. In the 1920s rotary dumpers for coal and coke were installed, as well as a large grain elevator. Port operations ended in the 1970s and the site was abandoned in 1988. The site has since been redeveloped for commercial use, and it currently includes a former Walmart store that opened in 2002 and closed in January 2016. Interstate 95 serves Port Covington through Exits 54 (Hanover Street) and 55 (Key Highway); through this area, McComas Street serves as a frontage road between the two exits and continues east into the Locust Point neighborhood. Proposed development In January 2016, plans were unveiled by Sagamore Development Company, owned by Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, regarding the redevelopment of Port Covington in South Baltimore. The new plan for Port Covington calls for two proposed new light rail stations, along with new residential and commercial development. The first station would be located west of Hanover Street, and the other would be located at the intersection of East McComas Street and East Cromwell Street, just south of Federal Hill. This proposed extension would create a new spur from the Central Light Rail line by crossing the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River south of Interstate 95. Additional features of the proposed redevelopment include a new entertainment venue, new waterfront park areas, makerspace, as well as new offices for Under Armour and other industries owned by Kevin Plank. Sagamore Development has requested $1.1 billion in federal, state and municipal government financing, including $535 million in tax increment financing (TIF) from the City of Baltimore. The proposed TIF is the largest ever proposed in Baltimore, and would be one of the largest TIFs in the country. According to the Baltimore Sun, MuniCap projects that the Port Covington properties owned by Sagamore would be worth $2,608,900,706 at full build out. Some local residents are concerned with the adverse environmental impact the project will have on an already unstable region. Other Baltimoreans are concerned that the economic impact of the development will only benefit a segment of the population, leaving behind the city's poorer, economically depressed communities. At an August 2016 city council work session to discuss the potential project, tempers brewed. A local clergy member and community organizer said, \\"The city really should not be in the business of subsidizing affluent enclaves, especially one year after the unrest.\\" An attorney for Sagamore Development reportedly bristled, and later offered that the project, which would include \\"world class\\" kayak facilities, would be available to the black community as well: \\"I'm fairly sure that African-Americans kayak too.\\" Another pastor and community activist shouted in response, \\"This is for rich white people! You want it, you pay for it yourself!\\" Community groups have called for public financing to be linked to guarantees for a public profit-sharing agreement and financing for schools to cover potential loss of $315 million in funding over 40 years for Baltimore schools. Advocates have also called for more affordable housing as part of the development, and lowering the size of the proposed TIF to cover only required infrastructure development, not additional amenities such as kayak landings. Construction officially began on the first phase of the development on May 13, 2019. The project is now overseen by Weller Development, headed by Marc Weller, a partner in Plank's Sagamore Development. In 2017, the New York investment bank Goldman Sachs invested $233 million and became a partner in the Port Covington project.

Current relations On 2 December 2009, Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic said that there are no obstacles for Montenegro to establish diplomatic relations with Kosovo. He also said that Montenegro has about 10,000 displaced people from Kosovo, a thousand of whom would like to return to their hometowns and it is up to the governments of Kosovo and Montenegro to resolve it.\\"Montenegro, Kosovo to Establish Diplomatic Links\\" balkaninsight.com 02-12-09 Link accessed 03-12-09 On 15 January 2010, Montenegro and Kosovo officially established diplomatic relations. Numerous motions have come from Kosovo and elsewhere for an exchange of embassies to formally show the mutual declarative establishment of diplomatic links, however President Filip Vujanoviƒá has continually rejected that possibility, stating the status of the Montenegrin minority in Kosovo and the return of expelled non-Albanian refugees as a precondition, ever since the recognition in 2008.Vujanoviƒá: Ohrabruje inicijativa Pri≈°tine On 31 May 2012, Montenegro declared that it was to open an embassy in Kosovo stating that \\"good relations with neighbours and development of regional cooperation represent a lasting goal, stimulating progress in the countries of the region when it comes to EU and Euroatlantic integration and boosting stability in the region as a whole.\\" On 30 July 2013, Montenegro officially opened an embassy in Pristina with Radovan Miljaniƒá being appointed the charg√© d'affaires at the embassy to Kosovo. Border demarcation The border demarcation deal with Montenegro was one of the explicit requirements by the European Parliament for the visa liberalization process for Kosovo. In 2015, Ramush Haradinaj insisted that the 1974 Yugoslav borders were necessary in order to continue the good relations with Montenegro. The agreement was ratified by both governments in 2015 and was enforced March 2018 leading to √áakorr, an Albanian region symbolizing patriotism, being handed over to Montenegro. Kosovos prime minister Hashim Thaqi and Montenegros prime minister signed the agreement on February 17, 2018. The agreement has been criticized for being hypocritical as the prohibition to travel within the Schengen area had been lifted for more severe border issues amongst Georgia and Ukraine but not for Kosovo with its less severe border issues. Villagers in the Rugova valley vowed to take up arms if the government continued to ignore them. In 2016, The L√´vizja Vet√´vendosje accused PDK party of for the agreement of the Border Demarcation with Montenegro. Prime minister Isa Mustafa met the Rugova locals opposing the demarcation in 2016. A local stated that the prime minister did not say anything about the matter. Levizja Vetendesojes party leader Albin Kurti held a protest speech with 2000 activists leading to the postponing of the demarcation in the Kosovo parliament. In August 2015, prime minister Ramush Haradinaj criticized the demarcation. Four years later, in 2019, he met Muj√´ Rugova, to discuss the finalization of the demarcation. Ibrahim Rugova warned of the demarcation already in 2002. On August 28, 2015, a RTK employee suffered a second attack in his home by a group that opposed the demarcation. An unknown indiviudual tossed an explosive device inside resulting in no one being hurt. A group called Rugovasit claimed both attacks warning of more victims if the government continued to ignore the opposition. On August 30, six opposition supporters were detained by the police on suspicion of involvement in a rocket-propelled grenade attack on parliament. The European and International Federations of Journalists (EFJ/IFJ) condemned the attacks. Violent protests occurred in Pristina with riot police being attacked with molotovs. An article by Kosovapress writes that the Rugova locals attacked RTK because it supported the demarcation. Independent Balkan News Agency published an article explaining that international experts, appointed by Atifete Jahjaga, stated that the demarcation did not breach any laws. The opposition criticized the commission of being too similar to previous commissions. Both Albanian and Montenegrin locals around the borders stated that the politicians should take into consideration the opinions of the public.

He won 21 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on the 1959 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Davies is seen as the last great Welsh full backs, before the 'No direct kicking into touch' rule was introduced in the late sixties and changed the full back role.Thomas (1979), pg 132. Early and club career Born in Llwynhendy in 1933, Davies was an international Welsh Youth with Bynea, before making his debut for Swansea, against Ebbw Vale in 1951. He gave an excellent performance and soon was a regular in the squad, facing the South Africans for Swansea on 15 December later that year. Given the kicking duties against the Springboks, it wasn't the best performance from Davies, who missed a drop goal, penalty and an easy conversion; the points lost would have changed the result to a Swansea victory.Billot (1974), pg 204. Davies was a notoriously heavy and accurate tackler, and was a reliable rear guard defense against break away wingers, but he suffered physically through it. In the 1953/54 season he dislocated his shoulder for the first time and in a pre-season tour of Romania with Swansea in 1954 he shattered his shoulder when a heavy tackle took him into a concrete surround. His rugby career looked over until his shoulder was wired back together in a successful operation.Billot (1974), pg 241. In 1956, Davies left Swansea and joined Llanelli, the club he would remain with for the rest of his career, even when offered an ¬£8,500 to transfer to Leeds. In 1960 the South Africans played Llanelli as part of their tour. Davies was more than aware that in an earlier game against Swansea, the Springbok Francois Roux, had taken out Malcolm Rogers in a late tackle as Rogers had kicked a clearance. The tackle had sent Rogers to hospital with a dislocated shoulderBillot (1974), pg 204. and Davies was expecting Roux to try the same on him. When the South Africans played Llanelli, Davies was placed into the situation he had predicted. He collected a high ball at full back position and saw Roux closing in on him. Instead of kicking the ball clear, Davies, expecting the high tackle, kept the ball and swung his shoulders into Roux, knocking him to the ground. Roux recovered quickly but missed the next game. Davies later described Roux as a \\"...silly little man\\".Billot (1974), pg 240. International career Davies made his international debut for Wales against England on 17 January 1953 in a home game at the Cardiff Arms Park. Although Davies scored a penalty kick, it was the only score that Wales could muster, and they lost 8-3. Davies was selected for the remaining three games of the Championship, winning them all, with Davies scoring another penalty against Scotland. Injury kept Davies from international rugby until 1957, when he returned against England. The match against Ireland during the same campaign saw Davies's kicking win the match. In a game played in extremely muddy conditions, the Welsh pack took control and two penalty goals from Davies was enough to give Wales the victory. The 1958 Five Nations Championship game between England and Wales at Twickenham has become synonymous with Terry Davies. In a match where the Welsh team played without the Prince of Wales's feathers due to a mistake by the manufacturers, Davies had an opportunity to take the lead for Wales with a penalty kick. The mark was fifty yards out, and against the wind but Davies's kick was true and would have won the game but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced back. That night a group of Welsh supporters climbed the posts and cut down a section of the offending crossbar and took it back to Wales. Davies, a timber merchant, offered to replace it. In 1959, Davies was selected for the British Lions on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Davies should have been chosen for more matches, but a leg injury and some questionable selection choices restricted his appearances. During the second Test against New Zealand, Davies received a leg injury in the first quarter of an hour, but remained on the pitch to kick a penalty and a conversion. Although the Lions lost the game, Davies played well in the Final Test which the Lions won. During the 1960 season, Wales faced the touring South Africans and Davies was chosen to captain the Welsh team. At the beginning of the game Davies won the toss for Wales and chose to play into the strong wind. Wales kept the Springboks at bay in the first half trailing to a single penalty from Keith Oxlee, but failed to score in the second half even with the wind now behind them.Billot (1974), pg 237. Davies would captain Wales on two more occasions, but would play his last international game in 1961 against France.

Only about 50 individuals remain, with no captive population. Its behavior is similar to that of other subspecies of mule deer. The subspecies is threatened by feral dogs and poaching.Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World, Volume 4  Anatomy  The Cedros island mule deer shows a reduction in body size and antler size compared to mainland deer, which is an effect of isolation in a relatively small island, according to the \\"island rule\\" of Leigh Van Valen. There are also differences in fur coloration which distinguish cerrosensis from other mule deer, but most closely resembling Odocoileus hemionus fuliginatus.  Subspecies classification  Cerrosensis is one the ten named subspecies of mule deer. Although it may be a may be synonyms of O. h. eremicus or O. h. peninsulae, studies based on DNA samples, rather than observation, can show clearer objective differences. In the case of the Cedros deer, its status as a valid subspecies can be defended due to their endemicity to the island, morphological differences, and distinct mitochondrial patterns.  Distribution  Cedros deer primarily occupy the northern side of the island, being less common in the southern section, where human activity is more prevalent.

The cuisine is rooted in creole techniques with local produce flavored by spices found on the island.Sullivan, Lynne M. Adventure Guide to Dominica and St Lucia. Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2004. . P.107 Foods Dominica's cuisine is similar to many other Caribbean islands including that of Trinidad and St Lucia. Though separated by water Dominica and other Commonwealth Caribbean islands have distinct twists to their meals. Breakfast is an important meal in Dominica and is eaten every day. A typical meal includes saltfish, which is dried and salted codfish, and bakes made by making a dough and frying in oil prove popular before a long days at work. Saltfish and bakes can also double as fast food snacks that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors and Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passers-by alongside fried chicken, fish and tasty smoothies. Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten. More British influenced meals like eggs, bacon and toast are also popular alongside fried fish and plantains. Common vegetables eaten during lunchtime or dinner include plantains, tania, yams, potatoes, rice, and peas. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, fish which are normally stewed down with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme and using the browning method to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, Stew chicken, Stew beef, fried and stewed fish and many different types of hearty fish broths and Soups which are packed full with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions. Roadside stands and small-town restaurants typically serve fried chicken, fish-and-chips and \\"tasty bakes\\" which are fried dough made with flour, water and sugar or sometimes salt, along with cold drinks. The island produces numerous exotic fruits, including bananas, coconuts, papayas, guavas, pineapples, and mangoes which can be eaten as dessert and be pureed or liquefied. Dominica's national dish was the mountain chicken, which are snares of the legs of a frog called the Crapaud, which is endemic to Dominica and Montserrat. Found at higher elevations, it's a protected species and can only be caught between autumn and February. However as of 2013, the new national dish is Calalloo soup, made from the green leaves of the dasheen plant and other vegetables and meat. Beverages Rivers flowing down from the mountains provide Dominica with an abundant supply of fresh water. Drinks include rum punch and smoothies. Dominica tea culture has a long history. Many traditional medicinal teas have origins with the original Carib culture of the island. Dominica brews its own beer under the Kubuli label.

Florida, 397 U.S. 387 (1970), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects defendants from successive prosecutions by states and municipalities for offenses based on the same criminal conduct.. Background Joseph Waller, Jr., also known as Omali Yeshitela, was a former member and organizer of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). During the 1950s and 1960s, he actively participated in the American Civil Rights Movement.Landry, Sue and Rogers, David K. \\"A Long Road of Rage.\\" St. Petersburg Times, 1996. Today, he is chairman of the Uhuru Movement and has started branches in the Uhuru House Centers of St. Petersburg, FL and Oakland, FL. This case was significant in propelling Yeshitela's path toward advocacy and activism. Previous Legal Precedents Before this case, the U.S. Supreme Court had not definitively ruled on the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause in regards to local and state ordinances and provisions. In fact, before Waller, about half of the states allowed for these double prosecutions, and some lower federal courts permitted it as well. Palko v. Connecticut. was the dominant precedent at the time, which gave permission for the individual states to essentially ignore the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution in enacting their own specific provisions regarding double jeopardy. Palko essentially gave the states full discretion in how they conducted double jeopardy prosecutions, with the exception that they followed the procedural due process of the judicial system. However, this line of precedents was replaced by another, Benton v. Maryland.. In this case, the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause was incorporated and made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, overruling the previous Palko case. Due to the holding in Benton, it became almost inevitable that the various state provisions outlining multiple prosecutions for the same instance be re-evaluated, some of them before the U.S. Supreme Court.Constitutional Law: Double Jeopardy: Prosecutions by Both a City and a State for an Identical Offense as a Violation of the Prohibition against Double Jeopardy: Waller v. State. Michigan Law Review, Vol. 68, No. 2 (Dec., 1969), pp. 336-346. Dual Sovereignty Before Waller was decided, states had different qualifications for what constituted double jeopardy and which circumstances allowed for multiple prosecutions. Some states theorized that the judicial relationship between the municipalities and the states was relative to the relationship between the state government and the federal government. This justification is similar to a dual sovereignty embedded in the states' legislation which permits those multiple prosecutions for the same occurrences and crimes. There have been a few cases, such as Abbate v. United States. and Bartkus v. Illinois,. that had previously allowed double prosecutions if they took place on a state level and then on a federal level, but obviously these precedents didn't last long. The U.S. Supreme Court has distinguished between the sovereignty of the states and the federal government regarding some principles, but they have rejected the claim that the separation of sovereignty is so far that double jeopardy need not be acknowledged by the states. Case Facts Waller was one of many who led a protest in St. Petersburg, Florida on December 29, 1966. During this protest, they marched to the St. Petersburg City Hall, where they removed a racially controversial mural from the wall. The mural exhibited a group of Negroes musically entertaining a group of whites. The protestors then continued to march through St. Petersburg until they were stopped and subsequently arrested by law enforcement. The police eventually obtained the mural from the protestors, but only after a scuffle resulting in the mural's damaged condition. The City of St. Petersburg charged Waller and five others with the violation of destruction of city property and disorderly breach of the peace. He was found guilty for both counts in the municipal court and was sentenced to 180 days in the county jail.Waller, 397 U.S. at 388-396. During the municipal court process, Waller made the statement that ‚ÄúWhat happened Dec. 29, 1966, occurred as a result of a program I initiated to bring the plight of my people to the attention of the people of St. Petersburg‚Ä¶‚Äù \\"Judge Phillips Studies Waller's Bid for Bail.\\" St. Petersburg Times, Jan 6, 1968. Waller was subsequently charged by the State of Florida for grand larceny, which was based on the same acts with which he was charged against by the City of St. Petersburg. He moved for a writ of prohibition in the Florida Supreme Court to prevent a second trial in the circuit court, due to his claim that a second trial would constitute double jeopardy. The Florida Supreme Court denied relief. Waller was then tried in the Circuit Court of Florida by a jury, where he was found guilty of the grand larceny felony charge. He was then sentenced to six months to five years in prison, minus 170 of the days from his previous 180-day municipal court sentence. Upon Waller's appeal to the Florida District Court of Appeals, he was denied of his double jeopardy claim. The District Court's rejection acknowledged that the courts‚Äô actions were based on the same acts as those involved in the two City of St. Petersburg ordinances, but still did not find Waller to be subject to double jeopardy. Waller's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Florida Supreme Court was denied. The United States Supreme Court then granted review for this case, with Leslie H. Levinson from Gainesville, Florida representing petitioner Joseph Waller and George Georgieff from Tallahassee, Florida as representation for the respondent. The case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on November 13, 1969, and the decision was handed down on April 6, 1970. Decision Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the majority opinion in this case on behalf of the U.S. Supreme Court. The question was whether or not two courts in the same state can place defendants on trial for the same crime, and whether or not this constituted double jeopardy. Double jeopardy provisions were made applicable to the states in Benton v. Maryland. This case, in addition to North Carolina v. Pearce,. was considered in answering the issue brought forth in Waller's case. Florida asserted that there is a separate sovereignty between the state government and its municipalities, similar to the sovereignty distinguished between the federal government and the states. This is not the only state to assert this theory. However, the Florida courts were found to have error in their holdings that being tried in a municipal court is not a bar for being tried at the state level for the same offense. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court found that it was considered double jeopardy to be held for the same charge once by a state, and another by a local or municipal court, thereby making the state of Florida's actions unconstitutional. Concurring Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a concurring opinion, in which he agreed with the majority that municipal and state courts within the same state are not separately sovereign. However, he furthered his opinion by stating that a second trial is barred if it occurs in the same state as the first unless it falls under one of the exceptions to the ‚Äúsame transaction‚Äù rule, which provides the legal exceptions to double jeopardy that would be considered permissible. Mural Replacement In July 1998, St. Petersburg City Council members approved a plan that outlined a replacement mural to hang where the former one once hung. The proposed new mural was a landscape oil painting of water and palm trees and is one of two created by the Tarpon Springs artist Christopher Still that were placed above the marble staircases in the city hall that led to the council's chambers. The two paintings are 78 inches by 118 inches and were purchased by the city of St. Petersburg for $50,000 as a part of their public arts program.Caldwell, Alicia. \\"Mural to Grace City Hall's Blank Walls Again.\\" St. Petersburg Times, July 18, 1998. When Yeshitela (formally Waller, Jr.) learned of the new mural plans, he felt that an apology on behalf of the city was necessary. According to him, \\"It seems to me that this City Council, which is talking about putting a mural in that spot, should be obligated to make an apology to the African community for that monstrosity that hung there until 1966,\\" said Yeshitela, chairman of the African People's Socialist Party. When I tore that mural down, I was castigated in a lot of quarters as a criminal and I in fact served time in prison for it.\\" Other African-Americans in the community shared in Yeshitela's resentment of the St. Petersburg City Council's new decisions regarding the mural. Ashe v. Swenson Ashe v. Swenson. is important to Waller because it was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in the same year and both cases questioned the application of double jeopardy in the states. The petitioner was convicted of robbing one man who was playing poker with five others. During the trial, the jury found the petitioner to be not guilty due to insufficient evidence and was therefore acquitted of the charges. However, shortly after, another suit was brought against the petitioner for the robbery of another man that was present at the same incident. During this trial, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower decisions and held that the petitioner could not be prosecuted twice for the same course of events. Justice Brennan provided a concurring opinion, stating that the decision should have been reversed simply because the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits it. Justice Burger provided a dissenting opinion in which he expressed that the petitioner's second trial was not double jeopardy because it was a different complainant. Conclusion Waller v. Florida established the presence and extension of the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause in the states and their municipalities and further clarified discrepancies that existed in a large portion of the states. The details of the case also stood on a monumental level regarding the civil rights movement in St. Petersburg, Florida. See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 397 *Ashe v.

He was noted for his peaceful nature, but also noted for his overeagerness to please powerful individuals at court.  Background  Miao Jinqing was born in 685, during the first reign of Emperor Ruizong. His family was from Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, roughly modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and traced its ancestry to the royal clan of Chu, a state of the Warring States period.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. His ancestors had been Confucian scholars for generations. His grandfather Miao Kui (ËãóÂ§î)That Miao Jinqing's grandfather was named Miao Kui was per his biography in the Old Book of Tang. His biography in the New Book of Tang did not give a name for his grandfather, but his family tree in the table of chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang gave his grandfather's name as Miao Xikui (ËãóË•≤Â§î). Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 113 with New Book of Tang, vol. 75. was known for having refused appointment to civil service. His father Miao Daishu (ËãóÊÆÜÂ∫∂) did serve as an official, but only reached the office of secretary general of Longmen County (ÈæçÈñÄ, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Miao Jinqing himself was known for studiousness in his youth, and he was able to pass the imperial examinations, allowing him to enter civil service.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Sometime during the reign of Emperor Ruizong's son Emperor Xuanzong, Miao Jinqing started his official career as the sheriff of Xiuwu County (‰øÆÊ≠¶, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), and then served as the sheriff of Fengxian County (Â•âÂÖà, near the Tang capital Chang'an) -- which, given its proximity to Chang'an, was considered a promotion. For the faults of someone he was associated with‚Äîthe historical accounts were not clearOld Book of Tang, vol. 113. ‚Äî he was then demoted to be a census officer at Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). After his term of service was complete at Xu Prefecture, his performance was judged to be of high rank, and he was made the sheriff of Wannian County (Ëê¨Âπ¥) -- one of the two counties making up Chang'an, making the sheriff position, while low rank, a very prestigious position. He later served as Shiyushi (‰æçÂæ°Âè≤), a low-level imperial censor, before successively serving as a junior official at the ministries of finance, defense, and civil service affairs. In 735, he was promoted within the civil service affairs ministry to the position of Libu Langzhong (ÂêèÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), serving under the deputy ministers. In 736, he and his colleague as Libu Langzhong, Sun Ti (Â≠´ÈÄñ), were both given additional titles as Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫) as mid-level officials of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). In 739, while still carrying those titles, he became one of the officials in charge of selecting officials for civil service. Miao was said to be peaceful and humble in his character, and when the reserve officials argued with him over their commissions, regardless of how talkative or argumentative they got, he still tolerated their arguments without displeasure. In 741, he was promoted to be deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). Overall, he was responsible for selecting officials for five years. It was said that because he was not an exacting supervisor, his subordinates were carrying out misdeeds, including accepting bribes for commissions. At that time, there was peace in the Tang realm, and it was said that in a typical year, over 10,000 men would arrive at Chang'an to undergo the imperial examinations. Miao's superior, the minister of civil service affairs, was Li Linfu, who also served as chancellor and concentrated that office, and the ministry was effectively entrusted to Miao and his colleague as deputy minister, Song Yao (ÂÆãÈÅô). Because there were so many examinees, Emperor Xuanzong often also selected officials from other ministries to assist Miao and Song, hoping that by doing so the examination process could be fair. In 743, while Miao and Song were still in charge, there was a major scandal in the examination process. That year, Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂ•≠), the son of the deputy chief imperial censor, Zhang Yi (ÂºµÂÄö), was one of the examinees. Miao and Song knew that Zhang Yi was then well-trusted by Emperor Xuanzong and wanted to ingratiate him. When they selected 64 examinees who passed the examinations and ranked them, therefore, they ranked Zhang Shi the highest. It was well- known among the other examinees, however, that Zhang Shi never studied diligently, and there was much murmur. A former county magistrate, Su Xiaoyun (ËòáÂ≠ùÊÖç), heard about this, and he reported this to his former superior, the general An Lushan, who then was much favored by Emperor Xuanzong. An reported this to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong therefore gathered the 64 passing examinees and personally tested them. Only less than 20% of the examinees were able to satisfy Emperor Xuanzong, and in particular, Zhang Shi, when given the questions by Emperor Xuanzong, was not able to write a single character on his examination sheet. Emperor Xuanzong, in anger, demoted Miao, Song, and Zhang Yi all to be commandery governors -- in Miao's case, to be the governor of Ankang Commandery (ÂÆâÂ∫∑, roughly modern Ankang, Shaanxi).New Book of Tang, vol. 140.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 215. In 744, Miao was moved to be the governor of Wei Commandery (È≠èÈÉ°, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), as well as the surveyor of Hebei Circuit (Ê≤≥Âåó, i.e., roughly modern Hebei). He served there for three years and was said to have governed Wei Commandery well. After three years, he was summoned back to Chang'an, and, at his request, Emperor Xuanzong allowed him to visit his home county, Huguan County (Â£∫Èóú), on the way. When he arrived at Huguan, he got off his horse and began to walk as soon as he spotted the gates to the county seat. His attendant stated to him, \\"You, Governor, are highly honored and known for your virtues, and you should not take yourself lightly.\\" Miao responded: Once Miao arrived at Huguan, he spent several days inviting the people of the county to feasts and also donated a major part of his salary to serve as an education fund for the young men. Soon thereafter, he was made the governor of Hedong Commandery (Ê≤≥Êù±, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), as well as the surveyor of Hedong Circuit (also Ê≤≥Êù±, but referring to the entire circuit, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). He was later moved to serve as governor of Fufeng Commandery (Êâ∂È¢®, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and created the Baron of Gaoping. He later served as the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu) and the official in charge of the eastern capital Luoyang. After that tour of duty, he was summoned back to Chang'an to serve as the minister of justice (ÊÜ≤ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xianbu Shangshu) as well as Shangshu Zuo Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Â∑¶‰∏û), one of the secretaries general of the examination bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In 755, when An rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing) and quickly captured Luoyang, the governor of the key Shan Commandery (ÈôùÈÉ°, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan), abandoned his post without defending it. The powerful chancellor Yang Guozhong, who disliked Miao, wanted to use this as an opportunity to get Miao out of Chang'an, and therefore suggested that as Miao was a senior official, he would be a good choice to defend Shan. Emperor Xuanzong agreed and commissioned Miao as the governor of Shan as well as the commander of the forces in the region. Miao, who was then 70 years old and who did not want to undertake this military duty, visited Emperor Xuanzong to decline this commission on account of old age, and in doing so offended Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong thus removed him from his office and made him retire.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  In 756, with forces of An Lushan's new state of Yan approaching Chang'an, Emperor Xuanzong fled Chang'an toward Chengdu, without taking most members of his court. Many officials surrendered to Yan forces. Miao Jinqing did not do so, but instead fled into a valley and eventually to Ankang Commandery. Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng also did not follow Emperor Xuanzong but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was proclaimed emperor (as Emperor Suzong), an act later recognized by Emperor Xuanzong, who took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor). As Tang forces staged their counterattack in 757, Emperor Suzong advanced from Lingwu to Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, i.e., the capital of Fufeng Commandery). He summoned Miao to his court and made Miao Zuo Xiang (Â∑¶Áõ∏) -- the head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. He often consulted Miao on important affairs of state. Later in the year, after Tang forces recaptured Chang'an and Luoyang, Miao continued to serve as chancellor and the head of the examination bureau -- now retitled Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠). He was also created the Duke of Han. Miao repeatedly requested retirement, and in 759, as a part of Emperor Suzong's reorganization of his chancellors, he removed Miao and his colleague Wang Yu from their chancellor positions, replacing them with L√º Yin, Li Xian, and Li Kui. Emperor Suzong gave Miao the post of Taizi Taifu (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™ÂÇÖ) -- senior advisor to Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Yu. In 760, however, Emperor Suzong again made Miao Shizhong, returning him to the rank of chancellors. The Old Book of Tang had this to say about Miao's style of governance: In 762, Emperor Xuanzong died. Emperor Suzong, who was already ill, commissioned Miao to serve as regent for three days while he mourned. After Emperor Suzong himself died soon thereafter, Li Yu took the throne as Emperor Daizong but wanted Miao to serve as regent again briefly. This time, Miao declined, citing his own old age and his belief that having a regent was inappropriate given the circumstances, and Emperor Daizong agreed.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  In his old age, Miao Jinqing continued to serve as chancellor. He requested that he be allowed to report to the office of chancellors only every other day, and Emperor Daizong agreed -- and further permitted Miao to enter the office in a litter. He also met Miao regularly at Yanying Hall (Âª∂Ëã±ÊÆø) ‚Äî a mode which set a precedent for later emperors and later ailing chancellors. In 763, Tibetan, or Tubo, forces launched a surprise attack on Chang'an, and Emperor Daizong was forced to flee east. Miao, being ill, could not follow Emperor Daizong, and Tibetan forces, which proclaimed Emperor Daizong's second cousin Li Chenghong the Prince of Guangwu the Emperor of Tang, went to Miao's mansion to try to force him to serve Li Chenghong. Miao refused to cooperate and remained silent. Tibetan forces did not dare to kill him and left him alone. Later in the year, after Emperor Daizong's forces were able to force Tibetan forces to leave Chang'an and remove Li Chenghong, allowing Emperor Daizong's return, Miao was given the exceedingly highly honored title of Taifu (Â§™ÂÇÖ), but was removed from his chancellor position. He died in 765 and was buried with great honors. Initially, the officials responsible for posthumous names proposed for him the posthumous name of Yixian (ÊáøÁçª, meaning \\"benevolent and wise\\"). At that time, the most powerful figure at court was the chancellor Yuan Zai, who had previously served under Miao and was grateful to Miao, and he ordered the officials to change the proposal to the more honored Wenzhen (ÊñáË≤û, meaning, \\"civil and virtuous\\"). In 772, Emperor Daizong ordered that Miao be worshipped with Emperor Suzong at Emperor Suzong's temple.

It is dedicated to Edward the Martyr, who was King of England from 975 until his murder in 978. In 1525 it was at St Edward's that what is said to have been perhaps the first \\"openly evangelical\\" sermon of the English Reformation was delivered, and the church is sometimes labelled the \\"Cradle of the Reformation\\". It is a royal peculiar not belonging to a diocese. History Foundation The present church was founded in the 13th century on what is believed to be the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. In around 1400 the church was rebuilt, creating the present chancel and arches of the nave, though the arch at the base of the tower dates from the original building. There are some pictures and a description at the Cambridgeshire Churches website. When Henry VI ordered the clearing of land in order to create King's College, the church of St John Zachary that was used by both Trinity Hall and Clare was demolished. In 1445, by way of recompense, the living of St Edward's Church was granted to Trinity Hall, and the Chaplain is still appointed by the College. Two 15th-century side-chapels were built in St Edward's, the north chapel used by Trinity Hall, and the south by Clare. The pulpit, from which Hugh Latimer preached during the English Reformation Reformation St Edward's played a pivotal role in the English Reformation. During the 1520s a group of evangelicals led by Thomas Bilney had been meeting to discuss the preachings of Martin Luther and Erasmus's translation of the New Testament. At the Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve 1525, one of the group, Robert Barnes, gave what is believed to be the first openly evangelical sermon in any English church, and accused the Catholic Church of heresy. Over the next decade many of the great reformers preached at St Edward's, including Hugh Latimer, who was a regular preacher until he left Cambridge in 1531. These events have led to St Edward's being referred to as the \\"Cradle of the Reformation\\". Recent history St Edward's (interior) The buildings of central Cambridge have led to St Edward's becoming somewhat hidden away from view in its location on the west side of the Guildhall. It is surrounded on three sides by its namesake pedestrian alleyway, St Edward's Passage, whose 'Y-shaped' form has remained unchanged since at least the 16th century: there is only a tiny churchyard. It holds Grade II* listed status. During the 1930s, St Edward's served as the Toc H church for the east of England, and became popular with students, who referred to it as \\"Teddy's\\". The present east window was designed by George Gilbert Scott and was added during the restorations of 1858‚Äì60. The theologian F. D. Maurice was chaplain at St Edward's from 1870‚Äì72. The acting vicar-chaplain is Reverend Dr Mark Scarlata who is also Old Testament lecturer and tutor at St Mellitus College, London.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state, it continues to claim it as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. Initially there were no relations between the two; however, in the following years there has been increased dialogue and cooperation between the two sides. The European Union-facilitated negotiations resulted in the 2013 Brussels Agreement on the normalization of relations between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. The agreement pledged both sides not to block the other in the EU accession process, defined the structure of the police and local elections in all parts of Kosovo, and also established the proposal of the Community of Serb Municipalities. The United States-mediated diplomatic talks agreed on the interconnection of air, train and road traffic, while both parties signed the 2020 agreement on the normalisation of economic relations. Kosovo and Serbia are expected to become part of the single market, known as the Mini Schengen Zone. Reaction to declaration of independence Serbia strongly opposed Kosovo's declaration of independence, which was declared on 17 February 2008. On 12 February 2008, the Government of Serbia instituted an Action Plan to combat Kosovo's anticipated declaration, which stipulated, among other things, recalling the Serbian ambassadors for consultations in protest from any state recognising Kosovo, which it has consistently done.

On 25 March 2008, the outgoing Prime Minister, Vojislav Ko≈°tunica stated that membership in the EU should be \\"left aside,\\" until Brussels stated whether it recognised Serbia within its existing borders. On 24 July 2008, the Government decided to return its ambassadors to EU countries. Other ambassadors were returned following the positive outcome of the vote in the UN General Assembly. Serbia has expelled diplomatic representations of all neighboring countries that subsequently recognised Kosovo's independence: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. On 15 August 2008, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremiƒá filed a request at the United Nations seeking a non- legally binding advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of whether the declaration of independence was in breach of international law. The United Nations General Assembly adopted this proposal on 8 October 2008. In July 2010, the ICJ issued its opinion which found that Kosovo's declaration of independence \\"did not violate international law\\". 2008‚Äì2013 Since the declaration of independence, Serbia refused to deal directly with the Republic of Kosovo, but only through the international intermediaries UNMIK and EULEX.

Liaison officers are also being exchanged. Belgrade and Pristina are urged to continue talks in Brussels, but Serbia is not obliged to recognize Kosovo at any point in the process. On 27 March 2012, four Kosovo Serbs, including the mayor of Vitina, were arrested by Kosovo Police while attempting to cross the disputed border at Bela Zemlja back into Kosovo with campaign materials for an upcoming election. They were subsequently charged with \\"incitement to hatred and intolerance among ethnic groups\\". The following day, trade unionist Hasan Abazi was arrested with fellow unionist Adem Urseli by Serbian police manning the Central Serbia/Kosovo crossing near Gjilan. Abazi was charged with espionage and Urseli with drug smuggling. Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá stated of the arrests that \\"Serbian police did not wish to take this approach, but the situation obviously could no longer go on without retaliation... If someone wants to compete in arrests, we have the answer\\". According to his lawyer, Abazi was then held in solitary confinement. On 30 March, the Serbian High Court in Vranje ordered Abazi to be detained for thirty days on espionage charges dating to an incident in 1999 in which Abazi allegedly gave information to NATO. Abazi's arrest was protested by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as \\"arbitrary\\".

On 19 October 2012, normalisation talks mediated by the European Union began in Brussels with Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha√ßi, where the two PMs sat at the table and initiated talks on normalising relations between Pristina and Belgrade. Reaching such a deal was a necessary condition of Serbia's EU candidacy. The governments slowly reached agreements and deals on various areas, such as freedom of movement, university diplomas, regional representation and on trade and international customs. In Brussels, Serbia and Kosovo agreed that implementation of the border agreement would start on 10 December 2012. A historic meeting took place on 6 February 2013, when Serbian president Tomislav Nikoliƒá and Kosovar President Atifete Jahjaga sat at the same table for the first time since Kosovo declared independence. Following a December 2012 agreement, the two nations swapped liaison officers who worked at EU premises in the two capitals. Pristina referred to these officers as \\"ambassadors\\", but Belgrade rejected such a designation. Serbia's top officials met with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton in Brussels, on 11 March 2013, Serbian president Nikoliƒá said that Serbia and Kosovo were very close to signing an agreement which would improve their relations. On 19 April 2013, the two governments completed the Brussels Agreement that was hailed as a major step towards normalising relations, and would allow both Serbia and Kosovo to advance in European integration. The agreement is reported to commit both states not to \\"block, or encourage others to block, the other side's progress in the respective EU paths.\\" Amongst other measures the deal establishes a special police commander (Commander will be appointed by Pristina from a list submitted by Serbs) and appeal court (Under Pristina laws and procedures) for the Serb minority in Kosovo, but does not amount to a recognition of Kosovo's independence by Belgrade. There were no Special provisions in the agreement given to Serb communities in North Kosovo as all municipalities have the same rights and status. In news reports Ashton was quoted as saying, \\"What we are seeing is a step away from the past and, for both of them, a step closer to Europe\\", whilst Tha√ßi declared \\"This agreement will help us heal the wounds of the past if we have the wisdom and the knowledge to implement it in practice.\\" The accord was ratified by the Kosovo assembly on 28 June 2013. 2013‚Äìpresent negotiations 2013 Brussels Agreement Kosovo‚ÄìSerbia negotiations encountered difficulties in the wake of the agreement reached in Brussels. On 7 August 2013, an agreement was announced between the two governments to establish permanent border crossings between Serbia and Kosovo throughout 2014. Ivica Daƒçiƒá, Prime Minister of Serbia (left), and Hashim Tha√ßi, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right), with Catherine Ashton (middle) in Munich, 2014. On 9 September 2013, an agreement was reached to allow Kosovo to apply for its own international dialling code. Two days later, the Serbian government announced the dissolution of the Serb minority assemblies it created in northern Kosovo in order to allow the integration of the Kosovo Serb minority into the general Kosovo population. In order to facilitate the integration of the Serb minority in the north into Kosovar society, the Kosovo parliament passed an amnesty law pardoning for past acts of resistance to Kosovo authorities. This principle was put into effect in early December, as the governments of Serbia and Kosovo agreed to the appointment of a Kosovo Serb as chief of police in the Serbian area of Northern Kosovo. The two governments also reached agreement in principle to allow Kosovo to apply for its own international dialing code once the Serbian government begins EU accession talks. On September 19, a EULEX officer was killed in the Serb area of Kosovo in a drive by shooting, this murder viewed as an act by opponents of reconciliation. In late 2014, Kosovo‚ÄìSerbia negotiations reached standstill owing to the change of government in Kosovo which now advocated a more hardline approach towards Serbia. More difficulties arose in December 2014, as President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic went against the position of the government by stating that any decision on Kosovo must be submitted to a referendum. On August 26, 2015, Kosovo and Serbia signed a series of agreements in key areas, in a major step towards normalizing ties. Kosovo's foreign minister claimed it was a de facto recognition of independence, while Serbia's prime minister said it ensured representation for ethnic-Serbs in Kosovo. As a result of the agreements, Serbia can now move forward with its negotiations to join the EU. However, the Serbian government still opposes any initiative by the government of Kosovo joining UN agencies, and Kosovo's initiative regarding UNESCO membership was met with protest by Belgrade. Community of Serbian Municipalities thumbrightMunicipalities of Kosovo as organized by the Republic of Kosovo On 13 December 2016, at the 3511th Council of the European Union meeting, the delegates urged Kosovo to swiftly implement in good faith its part of all past agreements, in particular the establishment of the Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities and to engage constructively with Serbia in formulating and implementing future agreements. On December 29, 2016, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Daƒçiƒá noted the significance of maintaining the dialogue and implementing all agreements, primarily those that apply to establishing the Community of Serb Municipalities. On December 30, 2016, Kosovo President Hashim Tha√ßi had stated that he hopes the questions of the Community would be resolved at the beginning of 2017. That never occurred, and deep divisions followed within the government. 2017 train incident In January 2017, a train painted in Serbian flag colors and with the words \\"Kosovo is Serbia\\" was prevented from crossing into Kosovo. Serbian President Tomislav Nikoliƒá stated that Serbia would send its army to Kosovo if Kosovo Serbs are attacked. Kosovo viewed the train as a provocation. Both Serbia and Kosovo mobilized their military forces along the Kosovo-Serbian border. 2018 Kosovo arrest of Serbian politician Kosovar special police arrested Serbian politician Marko ƒêuriƒá visiting Northern Mitrovica in March 2018. Despite being banned from entering Kosovo and warnings by the Kosovo police, ƒêuriƒá decided to visit the northern part of Mitrovica. The Kosovo police armed with rifles followed by EULEX entered premises where local Serb politicians were having a meeting and arrested ƒêuriƒá, who according to Pacolli is banned from entering as he \\"encourages hatred\\". Commenting on the event, President Vuƒçiƒá called the Kosovo state and police terrorists, and that they were out to take over northern Kosovo. Trade sanctions (2018‚Äì2020) On 6 November 2018, Kosovo announced a 10% tax on goods imported from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The official justification for the new tariff was unfair trade practices and destructive behaviour aimed at Kosovo. Ministry of Economy of Serbia (sitting left), Richard Grenell, Special US Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations (standing right), Eset Berisha, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Kosovo (sitting right) On 21 November 2018, Kosovo announced an increase in the tax rate to 100%. It is believed that the new policy was a response to Kosovo's third failed bid for Interpol membership, a result widely blamed on Serbian campaigning by Kosovar public officials. On the day of the announcement, the Deputy Prime Minister Enver Hoxhaj publicly tweeted: ‚ÄúSerbia is continuing its aggressive campaign against Kosovo in the int‚Äôl stage. (...) To defend our vital interest, Government of Kosovo has decided today to increase the customs tariff to 100%. (...)‚Äù On 1 April 2020, Kosovo abolished the 100% tax. Belgrade-Pristina flights On 20 January 2020, Serbia and Kosovo agreed to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades. Eurowings, the no-frills subsidiary of German flag-carrier Lufthansa, will fly between Belgrade and Pristina. The deal came after months of diplomatic talks by Richard Grenell, the United States ambassador to Germany, who was named special envoy for Serbia-Kosovo relations by President Donald Trump the year before. Energy In April 2020 Kosovo‚Äôs Transmission System Operator, KOSTT, was formally separated from Elektromre≈æa Srbije through a vote by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, ENTSO-E, which paved the way for Kosovo to become an independent regulatory zone for electricity. The agreement was criticized in Serbia, who accused Pristina and Tirana of pursuing a ‚ÄúGreater Albania of energy‚Äù. Marko Djuric, the Serbian government‚Äôs liaison for Kosovo released a statement saying that \\"Serbia is the owner and builder of the power grids in Kosovo and Metohija, for which there is abundant evidence\\". 2020 economic normalization agreements Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, President of Serbia (left), Donald Trump, President of the United States (middle), and Avdullah Hoti, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right), signing the agreement in the White House, 2020. On 4 September 2020, under a deal brokered by the United States, Serbia and Kosovo agreed to normalise economic relations. The deal will encompass freer transit, including by rail and road, while both parties agreed to work with the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and to join the Mini Schengen Zone, but also to commence rail links between them such as Ni≈°-Pristina and Pristina-Merdare and to connect the Belgrade-Pristina rail network with a deep seaport on the coast of the Adriatic Sea They will also conduct feasibility study with the U.S. Department of Energy concerning the sharing Gazivoda Lake which straddles the border between the two states. In addition to the economic agreement, Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv starting in June 2021 and Israel and Kosovo agreed to mutually recognise each other. September 2020 talks in Brussels On 7 September, Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti met for talks in Brussels hosted by Josep Borrell under the auspices of the European Union. At a press conference after the talks EU Special Representative for the Serbia-Kosovo Dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, stated that \\"full progress\\" had been made in the areas of economic cooperation, missing persons and displaced people.https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/serbia-kosovo-negotiations-advance- eu/1965866 Vuƒçiƒá and Hoti will meet again in Brussels on 28 September 2020 where they will discuss arrangements for minority communities, the settlement of mutual financial claims and property and will attempt to make progress towards a more comprehensive agreement. Minorities Since the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, a large portion of Kosovo Serbs have been displaced from their homes, like other minorities throughout the province. A significant portion of Serbian Orthodox churches, as well as Serbian cemeteries and homes, have been demolished or vandalised. Albanian and Serbian traditional clothing from Kosovo The Serbian Government promised suspended Serb prison workers from Lipljan money if they were to leave the Kosovo institutions, which they were working in, so they did. However they were never paid, so staged a continued a blockade of the Co-ordination Centre in Graƒçanica. They claim that Belgrade, the Kosovo Ministry specifically, has not paid them money promised for leaving the Kosovo institutions. Serbs have also responded by forming their own assembly. In September 2013, the Serb government dismantled the Serb minority assemblies in Mitrovica, Leposaviƒá, Zvecan and Zubin Potok as part of an agreement with the government of Kosovo. At the same time, the President of Kosovo signed a law that granted amnesty to ethnic Serbs in Kosovo for past acts of resistance to Kosovo law enforcement authorities. Kosovo pays considerable attention to the Albanian minority in Serbia. The Albanian minority in Serbia has voiced support for more rights in line with the rights of Serbs in Kosovo. In 2013, Isa Mustafa, then one of the leaders of opposition in Kosovo, referring to the Brussels Agreement said that \\"Once the programme for implementing the agreement is finished, Kosovo and Serbia have to open a discussion about the issue of the rights that Albanians who live in Presevo and in Serbia enjoy\\".

It stars Amy and Dan Cahill, two orphans who discover, upon their grandmother Grace's death, that they are part of the powerful Cahill family, whose members constantly fight each other for Clues, which are ingredients to a mysterious serum. The novel has received generally positive reviews.  Plot  Plot introduction  Many of the well-known names in history are said to be part of the real-life Cahill family, making it \\"the most powerful family in the world.\\" Amy and Dan, the main protagonists, currently live in Boston, Massachusetts in an apartment with their Aunt Beatrice. Names such as Marie Curie, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Napoleon Bonaparte, and George Washington were all part of one of the four family branches‚Äîthe power-hungry Lucians, the strong and sporty Tomas, the inventive Ekaterinas, and the creative Janus, as well as the Madrigals. Dan and Amy are warned to \\"beware the Madrigals,\\" but what the Madrigals are is not revealed in this novel. While most of the characters in the book know which branch they belong to (as shown throughout the series), the main characters do not.  Plot summary  The story begins with Grace Cahill lying on her deathbed. She requests that William McIntyre, her lawyer, change her will to the alternate version, and she soon dies after it is changed. After he is sure she is truly dead, a \\"man in black\\" steps out of the shadows and talks with McIntyre. The main characters, Amy and Dan Cahill, are then introduced. They are Grace's grandchildren going to her funeral at her mansion with Grace's sister and their guardian Aunt Beatrice. Right before the funeral Amy and Dan run into the Holts. The parents, Eisenhower and Mary-Todd, and their children, Hamilton (fourteen), Madison and Reagan, (eleven), turn Dan upside down. Then a non- random selection of many Cahills, including Amy and Dan, are called away in a private meeting for the will reading. Also called away are the Holts, the Kabras (nicknamed the Cobras); Ian (fourteen) and Natalie (eleven), Alistair Oh (inventor of microwaveable burritos), Irina Spasky (ex-KGB agent), The Starling triplets (Ned, Ted, and Sinead), Jonah Wizard (famous rapper host of the reality TV show \\"Who Wants to be a Gangsta\\"), Aunt Ingrid, and Aunt Beatrice. William McIntyre shows them a video of Grace Cahill telling them they're on the brink of their greatest challenge yet. Mr. McIntyre then says they have a choice, one million dollars, or a chance to be the greatest Cahill in history and gives them five minutes to decide. Dan wants the money for baseball cards, while Amy wants the chance in order to make Grace proud. Then the Kabras try to discourage them from taking the challenge. They are told by Mr. McIntyre that Abraham Lincoln, Harry Houdini and Lewis and Clark, among others, are Cahills. In the end, Amy and Dan chose the chance and receive a sealed envelope which contain a clue, they are the last ones to accept the challenge. The Holts, Alistair Oh, Starlings, Kabras and Spasky all accept the challenge. The envelope says: \\"Resolution: The fine print to guess. Seek out Richard S_.\\" As Amy and Dan think over what this means, the Starlings, Holts, Kabras, and Irina leave. Meanwhile William gives the kids Grace's last warning, \\"Beware the Madrigals.\\" Amy then goes to the library but does not find anything there, but Dan opens a passageway into Grace's secret library where Alistair and they find a copy of Poor Richard's Almanac. They give it to Alistair to look at, but just then the mansion burns down. They barely escape through the vents (Dan grabbing Grace's cat, Saladin, and Amy taking Grace's box of jewels on the way out) and go home where they convince their au pair Nellie to be their chaperone for their trip. They then head to the Franklin Institute, later escaping when it collapses, which injures and decommissions the Starlings, and then head to France. There they reject the offer of Jonah Wizard and then follow Irina Spasky, who, due to a theft chain, now has the almanac. Irina lured them into a trap on an island, but they were later saved unpredictably by the Holts. After their escape, Amy and Dan told Nellie all about the 39 Clues, and Nellie decides to help them. With their information, the Cahills go to the Paris Catacombs. They find some bones which have numbers on them: a magic box number game, planted there by Franklin to give the coordinates to the next Clue. This leads them to a church where they find a room with a mural of the four original Cahill's; Luke, Jane, Tom and Katherine, after who the four Cahill branches are named; Lucian, Janus, Tomas and Ekaterina, respectively. Inside the room is a small vial, with scrambled words on it. Dan solves the anagram, and they resolve to insert the vial into a lightning rod‚Äîone of Franklin's inventions‚Äîto charge it. Amy succeeds, but the vial is then stolen by the Kabras. However, Dan still has the original paper, which had been attached to the vial, and solves the puzzle for the clue: iron solute. Amy's internet searches for Franklin also have led them to the probable location of the second Clue: Vienna, Austria, the home of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Major themes  The major themes of the novel are talent and power. The historical members of the Cahill family are all talented. Each branch has specific talents in a certain area; for example the Ekaterina branch is talented in the area of technology. The members of each teams in the family are obviously talented or have some other edge and yet Amy and Dan are viewed as the main threats. Over the course of the book Amy and Dan discover their own unique talents. The premise of the series is that the person who finds the solution to the clues will come into an inordinate amount of power.  Reception  The Maze of Bones met with a generally positive reviews and spawned optimism for the rest of the series. It entered the Children's Books New York Times Best Seller list at number one on September 28, 2008 and stayed on the list for children's chapter books for 24 weeks. Publishers Weekly said it \\"mixes just the right proportions of suspense, perils, and puzzles\\" and that it was a \\"rollicking good read\\", while noting that \\"the story does not end so much as drop off a cliff.\\" School Library Journal said that \\"the book dazzles\\" and \\"stands solidly on its own feet and will satisfy while whetting appetites for more.\\" Mary Quattlebaum, writing for the Washington Post, said that \\"though the villainous relatives are rather flat, the historical tidbits and fast-moving plot will engage readers\\". Austin Grossman, writing for The New York Times, gave a generally mixed review, saying the premise for the series was \\"dramatic and instantly engaging\\", although he commented that Amy and Dan were \\"agreeably flawed characters but have an undeniably focus-grouped, manufactured quality ‚Äì as does, let‚Äôs face it, the whole book\\". He also found the supporting characters to be made up of stereotypes and the writing \\"carefully bland, as if it didn‚Äôt trust its readers enough\\".

The core of the languages consists of modular graph rewrite rules, which are built on declarative graph pattern matching and rewriting; they are supplemented by many of the constructs that are used in imperative and object-oriented programming, and are completed with language devices known from database query languages. The Graph Rewrite GENerator compiles the languages into efficient CLI assemblies (via C#-Code in an intermediate step), which can be integrated via an API into code written in any .NET-language. GrGen can be executed under Windows and Linux (Mono needed) and is open source available under LGPL v3. For rapid prototyping and debugging, an interactive shell and a (VCG-)graph viewer are included in the package. With its languages and its visual and stepwise debugging, GrGen allows one to develop at the natural level of abstraction of graph-based representations, such as those employed in engineering, model transformation, computational linguistics, or compiler construction (as intermediate representation). GrGen increases productivity for those kinds of tasks far beyond what can be achieved by programming in a traditional programming language; due to many implemented performance optimizations it still allows one to achieve high-performance solutions. Its authors claim that the system offers the highest combined speed of development and execution available for the algorithmic processing of graph-based representations (based on their performance regarding diverse tasks posed at different editions of the Transformation Tool Contest (/GraBaTs)).

The track \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", written by Phil Collen, was later covered by Collen's band Def Leppard as a B-side for their Adrenalize album. Aside from the single, the album was received very poorly by the critics and the public which led to disbanding of the band.

A digital microscope is a variation of a traditional optical microscope that uses optics and a digital camera to output an image to a monitor, sometimes by means of software running on a computer. A digital microscope often has its own in-built LED light source, and differs from an optical microscope in that there is no provision to observe the sample directly through an eyepiece. Since the image is focused on the digital circuit, the entire system is designed for the monitor image. The optics for the human eye are omitted. Digital microscopes can range from cheap USB digital microscopes to advanced industrial digital microscopes costing tens of thousands of dollars. The low price commercial microscopes normally omit the optics for illumination (for example K√∂hler illumination and phase contrast illumination) and are more akin to webcams with a macro lens. For information about stereo microscopes with a digital camera in research and development, see optical microscope. History An early digital microscope was made by a company in Tokyo, Japan in 1986, which is now known as Hirox Co. LTD.http://www.hirox-usa.com/AboutUs/ It included a control box and a lens connected to a computer. The original connection to the computer was analog through an S-video connection. Over time that connection was changed to Firewire 800 to handle a large amount of digital information coming from the digital camera. Around 2005 they introduced advanced all-in-one units that did not require a computer, but had the monitor and computer built-in. Then in late 2015 they released a system that once again had the computer separate, but connected to the computer by USB 3.0, taking advantage of the speed and longevity of the USB connection. This system also was much more compacted than previous models with a reduction in the number of cables and physical size of the unit itself. A digital microscope allows several students in Laos to examine insect parts. This model cost about USD 150. The invention of the USB port resulted in a multitude of USB microscopes ranging in quality and magnification. They continue to fall in price, especially compared with traditional optical microscopes. They offer high-resolution images which are normally recorded directly to a computer, and which also use the computer power for their built-in LED light source. The resolution is directly related to the number of megapixels available on a specific model, from 1.3 MP, 2 MP, 5 MP and upwards. Stereo and digital microscopes A primary difference between a stereo microscope and a digital microscope is the magnification. With a stereo microscope, the magnification is determined by multiplying the eyepiece magnification times the objective magnification. Since the digital microscope does not have an eyepiece, the magnification cannot be found using this method. Instead the magnification for a digital microscope was originally determined by how many times larger the sample was reproduced on a 15‚Äù monitor. While monitor sizes have changed, the physical size of the camera chip used has not. As a result magnification numbers and field of view are still the same as that original definition, regardless of the size of the monitor used. The average difference in magnification between an optical microscope and a digital microscope is about 40%. Thus the magnification number of a stereomicroscope is usually 40% less than the magnification number of a digital microscope. Since the digital microscope has the image projected directly on to the CCD camera, it is possible to have higher quality recorded images than with a stereo microscope. With the stereo microscope, the lenses are made for the optics of the eye. Attaching a CCD camera to a stereo microscope will result in an image that has compromises made for the eyepiece. Although the monitor image and recorded image may be of higher quality with the digital microscope, the application of the microscope may dictate which microscope is preferred. Digital eyepiece for microscopes Digital eyepiece for microscopes Software contain wide ranges of optional accessories provides multipurpose such as phase contrast observation, Bright and dark field observation, microphotography, image processing, particle size determination in ¬µm, pathological report and patient manager, microphotograph, recording mobility video, drawing and labeling etc. Resolution With a typical 2 megapixel CCD, a 1600√ó1200 pixels image is generated. The resolution of the image depends on the field of view of the lens used with the camera. The approximate pixel resolution can be determined by dividing the horizontal field of view (FOV) by 1600. Increased resolution can be accomplished by creating a sub-pixel image. The Pixel Shift Method uses an actuator to physically move the CCD in order to take multiple overlapping images. By combining the images within the microscope, sub-pixel resolution can be generated. This method provides sub-pixel information, averaging a standard image is also a proven method to provide sub-pixel information.  2D measurement  Most of the high-end digital microscope systems have the ability to measure samples in 2D. The measurements are done onscreen by measuring the distance from pixel to pixel. This allows for length, width, diagonal, and circle measurements as well as much more. Some systems are even capable of counting particles.  3D measurement  3D measurement is achieved with a digital microscope by image stacking. Using a step motor, the system takes images from the lowest focal plane in the field of view to the highest focal plane. Then it reconstructs these images into a 3D model based on contrast to give a 3D color image of the sample. From these 3D model measurements can be made, but their accuracy is based on the step motor and depth of field of the lens.  2D and 3D tiling  2D and 3D tiling, also known as stitching or creating a panoramic, can now be done with the more advanced digital microscope systems. In 2D tiling the image is automatically tiled together seamlessly in real-time by moving the XY stage. 3D tiling combines the XY stage movement of 2D tiling with the Z-axis movement of 3D measurement to create a 3D panoramic. USB microscopes Digital microscopes range from inexpensive units costing from perhaps US$20, which connect to a computer via USB connector, to units costing tens of thousands of dollars. These advanced digital microscope systems usually are self-contained and do not require a computer. Some of the cheaper microscopes which connect via USB have no stand, or a simple stand with clampable joints. They are essentially very simple webcams with small lenses and sensors--and can be used to view subjects which are not very close to the lens-- mechanically arranged to allow focus at very close distances. Magnification is typically claimed to be user- adjustable from 10√ó to 200-400√ó. Devices which connect to a computer require software to operate. The basic operation includes viewing the microscope image and recording \\"snapshots\\". More advanced functionality, possible even with simpler devices, includes recording moving images, time-lapse photography, measurement, image enhancement, annotation, etc. Many of the simpler units which connect to a computer use standard operating system facilities, and do not require device-specific drivers. A consequence of this is that many different microscope software packages can be used interchangeably with different microscopes, although such software may not support features unique to the more advanced devices. Basic operation may be possible with software included as part of computer operating systems--in Windows XP, images from microscopes which do not require special drivers can be viewed and recorded from \\"Scanners and Cameras\\" in Control Panel. The more advanced digital microscope units have stands that hold the microscope and allow it to be racked up and down, similarly to standard optical microscopes. Calibrated movement in all three dimensions are available through the use of a step motor and automated stage. The resolution, image quality, and dynamic range vary with price. Systems with a lower number of pixels have a higher frame rate (30fps to 100fps) and faster processing. The faster processing can be seen when using functions like HDR (high dynamic range). In addition to general- purpose microscopes, instruments specialized for specific applications are produced. These units can have a magnification range up to 0-10,000x, are either all-in-one systems (computer built-in) or connect to a desktop computer. They also differ from the cheaper USB microscopes in not only the quality of the image, but also in capability, and the quality of the system's construction giving these types of systems a longer lifetime.

It was shown as part of a retrospective on Italian comedy at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. Plot Bruno Fioretti, known as \\"Mandrake\\", is an inveterate gambler who never misses a day at the horse racing track in Rome. He is always at the track together with his friends Armando Pellicci, known as \\"Er Pomata\\" cause his use of hair gel, and Felice Roversi. They always bet on the wrong horses and they always end up being penniless. One day the three go to the Agnano Hippodrome to watch the race, but their horse is beaten. Back home, Gabriella, Mandrake's girlfriend, tired of the constant shortcomings of her partner, asks for advice from a fortune teller, who, without any purpose, induces her to bet on a Tris race. The three horses indicated by the cards and by Mandrake himself (Soldatino, King and D'Artagnan) are among the worst in circulation; above all Soldatino, the horse owned by lawyer De Marchis, a betting partner of the three friends. Witnessing a horse race in Cesena, Mandrake seems so determined to follow Gabriella's advice, but is convinced by Pomata to focus on another horse (Antonello da Messina, the superfavorite). The prediction of the fortune teller, however, is correct: Soldatino, King and D'Artagnan win the race and the astonished Mandrake, to save his relationship with Gabriella, shows her a false play by filling it with vain promises for the future. Furious with Pomata for his incorrect prediction, Mandrake begins to wait for him at home, together with \\"Er Ventresca\\", a creditor who has long been waiting to collect from Pomata 300.000 lire, managing to find him when he has set up the burial chamber for the late grandmother in her home. The death of the grandmother is, actually, a staging designed by Pomata to escape the numerous creditors. In the end, the three friends are forced to devise a \\"super-mandrakata\\", as Mandrake defines his brilliant scams, together with Pomata, Felice, De Marchis and her friend Mafalda. Given the extraordinary vigour found by Soldatino, who has begun to brilliantly win all the races in which he competes, the cronies decide that Mandrake will replace, in the imminent Grand Prix of the Aces of Tor di Valle, the unbeatable Jean-Louis Rossini, driver of the only true rival of De Marchis' horse, Bernadette, to slow it down and win by betting on Soldatino, whose stake is still very high. In this way, De Marchis also has the opportunity to triumph over the eternal rival Conte Dallara, owner of Bernadette, who given the rise of Soldatino has decided to bet on the sure win, since Rossini has never lost a race. The first part of the plan succeeds perfectly, with Mandrake ready to do anything to lose, and Pomata who, disguised as a police commissioner, kidnaps Rossini making him believe he is at the centre of a plot, taking him to a farmhouse outside the city. Shortly before the race, the former driver of Soldatino Stelvio Mazza, fed up with the lawyer de Marchis who does not decide to pay his arrears, refuses to drive the horse, and in his place is self-candid Pomata, who is an ex-driver with a regular license. The race starts and everything seems to go in the right direction until Mandrake, taken by the impetus of the competition and trying not to make the farce evident, forgets to lose and leads Bernadette closer and closer to Soldatino, who is in the first position; after a head-to-head between Mandrake and Pomata, Bernadette manages to get the better, being led to victory by Mandrake, arousing the ire of friends and lawyer. The whole gang ends up in court and here Mandrake tries to dissuade the judge with a gruelling speech on \\"who is\\" the horseplayer in a broad sense and then ends with the request for total mental infirmity. Gabriella reveals that she secretly played the winning Tris, thus making the money for the win, but just when the sentence seems obvious now, it turns out that even the Judge is a hardened bettor and everyone is acquitted. Gabriella finally manages to get married by Mandrake, who, with her tacit consent, escapes during the honeymoon to go to the hippodrome of Cesena.

Many of the residents today are Haredi Jews. The quarter borders Tel Arza on the west, the Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood on the north, Arzei HaBira on the east and Geula on the south. History The first immigrants of Bukharan Jews from Russian Turkestan (Central Asia) settled in Jerusalem in the 1870s and 1880s. They bought land and employed architect Conrad Schick to design a neighborhood for them. In 1890, seven members of the Bukharan Jewish community formed the Hovevei Zion Association of the Jewish communities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent. In 1891, the association drew up a charter stating that the new quarter would be built in the style of Europe's major cities. The streets were three times wider than other streets in Jerusalem at the time, and spacious mansions were built with large courtyards. The homes were designed with neo-Gothic windows, European tiled roofs, neo-Moorish arches and Italian marble. Facades were decorated with Jewish motifs such as the Star of David and Hebrew inscriptions. In 1905-1908, a dairy was opened and cotton fields were planted on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Construction of the quarter continued into the early 1950s. A total of 200 houses were built. During World War I, the Ottoman army occupied several buildings and cut down almost all of the trees. In 1920, a factory for weaving Persian carpets opened, providing employment for 80 women. Landmarks Yehudayoff Palace (\\"Armon\\") Decorative tiled floor of the Armon Between 1905‚Äì1914 Bukharan merchant Elisha Yehudayoff and his son-in-law, Yisrael Haim Hefetz, built the Armon (lit. \\"palace\\") using local limestone and Italian marble with Italian-baroque ornaments. The \\"Armon\\" hosted many of the leading figures of the time. During World War I, the Ottoman army had its headquarters there. When the British captured Jerusalem in 1917, a celebratory reception was held in the \\"Armon\\". 200 Jewish soldiers serving in the British army attended a Passover Seder there. In 1921, the founding convention of the Chief Rabbinate took place at the \\"Armon\\", at which Rabbis Abraham Isaac Kook and Jacob Meir were elected.

On his way back to Shri Anandpur Sahib after winning the Battle of Bhangani near Paonta Sahib, Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji reached the outskirts of dhakoli. As this village was laid down by Bhai Gurditta, elder son of Shri Guru Hargobind, there were many Sikhs in the village. On hearing the news of Guru sahib's arrival, Chaudary Ishar Das, a resident of the village along with the other followers reached to take Guru sahib's blessing. Guru sahib asked if he could do something for the welfare of the village and the area. Chaudary Ishar das with folded hands asked that there was no water in the village and people have to go to the Sukhna river to fetch water for their livelihood. Guru sahib was holding Barchaa in his hand. Hearing this problem Guru sahib started searching in the area and at particular place inserted his barcha in the soil and immediately sweet and clean water started flowing from earth. Looking at this every one was very happy and bowed before Guru sahib. Guru sahib gave some money to Chaudary to construct the place permanently and also told him that this place will be known as Baoli Sahib. The problem that people of dhakoli face is of unplanned roads and addresses, The Govt, of Punjab has bought a plan to allocate the whole Zirak pur in sectors but, the work progress is very sluggish.

It is situated in a shack settlementRed Location ‚Äì Museum Project. Noero Architects. Accessed 18 January 2018. that is one of the oldest townships in Port Elizabeth. The area once housed a Boer concentration camp, but the camp‚Äôs residents were moved in 1900 when the site would become one of the first few urban settlements for Black people.  Architecture  The building was designed by Cape Town-based architect Jo Noero of Noero Architects. The concept was inspired by the literary work of German-born professor Andreas Huyssen, whose work focuses on the idea of memory and history. It challenges the traditional notions of museum design. Instead of being treated as mere consumers of information, as in the case of conventional museums, visitors are encouraged to actively participate in the experience and navigate through it as they please with no set path. Construction reportedly cost R22-million and the municipality was believed to be spending R300 000 a month on operating costs. Similar to the surrounding informal settlements, the museum is made of corrugated iron boxes (12 in total) that are 6 x 6 x 12 metres. The museum houses an auditorium, library, art gallery, a memorial space honouring local heroes of the liberation struggle and offices. There were plans of erecting an adjoining tomb where struggle heroes Raymond Mhlaba and Govan Mbeki would be buried, but this was not seen to completion when the heroes‚Äô families refused to have the bodies exhumed. The use of boxes was inspired by the boxes that migrant workers used to keep their treasured possessions when they were away from their families in rural areas.  Awards  Over the years, Noero Wolff Architects collected numerous awards for their work on the museum. In 2005, the building won the World Leadership Award for Public Architecture in London at the World Leadership Forum. The Royal Institute of British Architects International Award and the Dedallo Minosse Presidents Award from Italy were added to its accolades in 2006. In 2010, it was named the Most Outstanding Building Outside the EU by the Royal Institute of British Architects when it received the Lubetkin Prize. It won the Icon Building of the Year Award from Icon in London in 2012.  Public resistance  In October 2013, after protests from Red Location residents over housing issues, the museum, library and gallery were closed. It has remained closed since. The residents demanded that the government fix their poorly constructed homes which had been declared structurally unsound. After the museum‚Äôs closure in 2013, the government and the community reached an agreement to demolish and correctly rebuild 288 houses. The work was not done. Nelson Mandela Bay human settlements political head Nqaba Bhanga argued that Human Settlements Minister at the time Lindiwe Sisulu had discontinued the rectification of the shoddy construction jobs. During violent protests windows were broken and other parts of the site were vandalised. Wiring, power sockets, fencing, air-conditioners and palisade fencing were also stolen from the premises. Repair costs for the building were estimated at R12-million but these have not begun. One of the museum‚Äôs security guards was fatally shot in front of the building in December 2013.

It was introduced by John Mather in his seminal work in Singularity theory in the 1970s as a technical tool for studying stable maps. Since then it has proved important in its own right. Roughly speaking, two map germs ∆í, g are scriptstylemathcal{K}-equivalent if ∆í‚àí1(0) and g‚àí1(0) are diffeomorphic. Definition Two map germs f,g:X to (Y,0) are scriptstylemathcal{K}-equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism :Psi: X times Y to Xtimes Y of the form Œ®(x,y) = (œÜ(x),œà(x,y)), satisfying, :Psi(x,0) = (varphi(x), 0), and :Psi(x,f(x)) = (varphi(x), g(varphi(x))). In other words, Œ® maps the graph of f to the graph of g, as well as the graph of the zero map to itself. In particular, the diffeomorphism œÜ maps f‚àí1(0) to g‚àí1(0). The name contact is explained by the fact that this equivalence is measuring the contact between the graph of f and the graph of the zero map. Contact equivalence is the appropriate equivalence relation for studying the sets of solution of equations, and finds many applications in dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, for example. It is easy to see that this equivalence relation is weaker than A-equivalence, in that any pair of scriptstylemathcal{A}-equivalent map germs are necessarily scriptstylemathcal{K}-equivalent. KV-equivalence This modification of scriptstylemathcal{K}-equivalence was introduced by James Damon in the 1980s. Here V is a subset (or subvariety) of Y, and the diffeomorphism Œ® above is required to preserve not Xtimes{0} but Xtimes V (that is, yin V Rightarrow psi(x,y)in V). In particular, Œ® maps f‚àí1(V) to g‚àí1(V). See also * A-equivalence References * J. Martinet, Singularities of Smooth Functions and Maps, Volume 58 of LMS Lecture Note Series.

Early life Born Alfreda Schoolcraft in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a family of actors and artists. She was reportedly the grandniece of President Zachary Taylor through her mother, Mathilda Schoolcraft. Her father, Henry R. Schoolcraft was an actor who appeared in shows in Mobile, Alabama, and at Crisp's Gaiety Theater in New Orleans and who despite his death in 1854, saw to it that his son Luke Schoolcraft and his daughters Jane and Alfreda all pursued careers in theater. She and Jane performed sketches as a pair in local variety theater. Alfreda married William B. Chippendale, scion of a famous English acting family headed by William Henry Chippendale about 1860. Her husband joined the Confederate Army as Second Lieutenant of the Louisiana 30th Infantry. He died in 1864 at the Battle of Ezra Church near Atlanta, Georgia. Acting career Even as her husband was serving in the Confederate Army, Alfreda was appearing on the Northern stage. She appeared at the Winter Garden in New York City as Nanette in the burlesque Camille in June 1863. She also appeared as Sally in The Eton Boy that same season before appearing at the Griswold Opera House in Troy, New York, in 1864-65. Chippendale appeared in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1865 before returning to New Orleans in 1866. In the early 1870s, Chippendale was traveling with the Irwin Selden Combination when she married its proprietor William Calder on December 8, 1872, in St. Charles County, Missouri. She went on to appear as Topsy in Uncle Tom's Cabin in New York City and such was the acclaim that she and her husband were engaged to appear on stage in England in the same roles. They sailed on August 3, 1878, and subsequently they appeared in London in Uncle Tom's Cabin and Rip Van Winkle. Later, Chippendale and Calder performed in The White Slave and The Shadows of a Great City. Death Alfy Chippendale died in Lancashire on November 9, 1887.

Nemukhin was associated with the 'Lianozovo Group' along with Oscar Rabin, Valentina Kropivnitskaya (1924-2008) and Lidiya Masterkova. Early life Born and raised in village, Nemukhin began his career working at a plant that produced technical instruments during World War II. In 1943, he met Petr Yefimovich Sokolov, assistant to Kazimir Malevich and later Pavel Kuznetsov. Sokolov introduced Nemukhin to the avant-garde movements of the time, launching him on a more experimental artistic path. Nemukhin joined the Studio School of the House of Unions (VTsSPS), from which he graduated in 1946. From 1952 to 1956 Nemukhin worked as an interior designer. In 1956 he met Oskar Rabin, with whom he met with a group of like-minded artists and poets whose primary meeting place was Rabin‚Äôs apartment. Since Rabin lived in the barracks in a small village, Lianozovo, the group is commonly known as the 'Lianozovo Group'. They also met at the village of Priluki on the banks of the Oka River, where Nemukhin‚Äôs father was born and where Nemukhin still owns a summer house. In 1958, Nemukhin attended the 1958 exhibit of American art in Moscow, which featured the Abstract Expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Wiliam De Koonig. This was followed by his first real abstract work in 1959. Role in Russian Art World In the 1950s when Russia, under Nikita Khrushchev, enjoyed a slightly more permissive cultural climate, Nemukhin was one of the artists who searched for new ways of expression. Rejecting the Socialist Realism that was the only approved artistic form allowed in the Soviet Union at the time, 'unofficial' artists like Nemukhin formed their own ways of portraying the world around them. Their art tended to be concerned with universal values and was highly individual in nature, leading to a constant battles with censorship authorities. Nemukhin played an important role in these confrontations as, being a significant personality in the Moscow art world of the 1960s and 1970s, he served as a negotiator between the artists and the state. Nemukhin's work is predominantly abstract and very personal. According to Julia Tulovsky, Assistant Curator at the Zimmerli Art Museum, ‚ÄúNemukhin is best known for his abstract still lifes with playing cards, fragments of card tables, and fighting cocks ... In a majority of cases, these symbolize accident, intrigue, and indeterminacy, contrasting with the doctrine of predetermination demanded by the Soviet establishment. Nemukhin intends his structures, surfaces and symbols to reveal the spiritual, the unreal, the emotionally obscure, and the existential.‚Äù Since 1959, Nemukhin participated in over a hundred group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world, including the first show of nonconformist art, the first autumnal review \\"In the Open Air\\" (\\"Bulldozer Exhibition\\") in Belyaeva in 1974. His works are in major public collections in Russia, Europe, and the United States. In addition to creating art, Nemukhin also collected works by artists of his generation. Refusing to sell the collection, which he claimed began when artist Anatoly Zverev painted a still life during a visit to his apartment, he instead donated it to the Tretyakov Gallery on its 150th anniversary in recognition of his friends. Works by Nemukhin can be found in the collections of major museums: the State Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Ludwig Museum (Cologne), amidst others. About 100 pieces are included in the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Soviet Nonconformist Art (Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum, New Brunswick, New Jersey). Life In the late 1990s, Nemukhin moved to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, but he recently has returned to Moscow. His latest work has taken the form of sculptural homages to artists like C√©zanne, Vladimir Veisberg, and Dmitry Krasnopevtsev, with reference to geometric abstraction and Constructivism. In 2008, Nemukhin became an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 2016, Nemukhin died. Personal life Nemukhin was closely associated with Lidiya Masterkova, who is often referred to as his wife in numerous citations although the two were in fact never married.

Typically metals are heated to between to increase their malleability and aid flow in the forging die.Lozinskii, p. 594. Process Induction heating is a non-contact process which uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece. By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current is made to flow in the material, thereby causing Joule heating. In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the Curie point due to hysteresis losses. The generated current is predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by the frequency of the alternating field and the permeability of the material.Lozinskii, p. 2. Power consumption Power supplies for induction forging vary in power from a few kilowatts to many megawatts and, depending on the component geometry, can vary in frequency from 50 Hz to 200 kHz. The majority of applications use the range between 1 kHz and 100 kHz.Rudnev, p. 142. In order to select the correct power it is necessary to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted. This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in KW hours per tonne the weight of metal to be processed and the time cycle. Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other system losses need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and empirical formula. Modern techniques utilise finite element analysisRudnev, p. 166. and other computer aided modeling techniques, however as with all such methods a thorough working knowledge of the induction heating process is still required. Output frequency The second major parameter to be considered is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in the surface of the component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation.Rudnev, p. 627. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the materialRudnev, p. 16. and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ‚àÜT it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ‚àÜT will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle. Advantages * Process controllability ‚Äì Unlike a traditional gas furnace the induction system requires no pre-heat cycle or controlled shutdown. The heat is available on demand. In addition to the benefits of rapid availability in the event of a downstream interruption to production the power can be switched off thus saving energy and reducing scaling on the components. * Energy efficiency ‚Äì Due to the heat being generated within the component energy transfer is extremely efficient. The induction heater heats only the part, not the atmosphere around it. * Rapid temperature rise ‚Äì High power densities ensure that the component reaches temperature extremely rapidly. Scale is reduced as are surface defects and undesirable effects on the surface metallurgy. * Process consistency ‚Äì The induction heating process produces extremely uniform consistent heat. This improves accuracy of the forging and can in extreme cases reduce post forging machining allowances and have a positive effect on die life.Davies, p. 11. * No Harmful Byproducts ‚Äì Induction heating does not generate any environmental waste products and is a clean process as opposed to more traditional heating methods that generate smoke and toxic emissions. Power Parts International Types =Bar end heating= Bar end heating is typically used where only a portion of the bar is to be forged. Typical applications of bar end heating are # Hot heading of bolts # Anti roll bars # Mining tools Subject to the required throughput, handling systems can vary from simple two- or three-station pneumatic pusher systems to walking beams and conveyors. =Billet heating= Billet HeatingPower Parts International In the induction billet heater the whole of the billet or slug is heated. Normally for short billets or slugs a hopper or bowl is used to automatically present the billets in line to pinch rollers, chain driven tractor units or in some cases pneumatic pushers. The billets are then driven through the coil one behind the other on water cooled rails or ceramic liners are used through the coil bore which reduce friction and prevent wear. The length of the coil is a function of the required soak time, the cycle time per component and the length of the billet. In high volume large cross section work it is not unusual to have 4 or 5 coils in series to give of coil or more.Rudnev, p. 447. Typical parts processed by in line billet heating:Rudnev, p. 78. # Small crankshafts # Camshafts # Pneumatic and hydraulic fittings # Hammer heads # Engine valves =Single shot= For long billets, single shot heating can be used. This process utilises similar systems to bar end heating except that the whole of the billet is driven into individual coils. As with bar end heating the number of coils is governed by ‚àÜT required and the thermal properties of the material being heated.

Located in Norcross, Georgia, Desperado's president is Joe Pruett, its creative director is Stephan Nilson, and its director of business development is former Caliber Press publisher Gary Reed. Overview With a background as former creative director of Caliber Press and editor of Caliber's 1990s anthology Negative Burn, Pruett founded Desperado in 2004. After initially planning on launching the Desperado line alone, Pruett instead announced in September 2004 that Desperado had joined Image Comics' publishing lineup. The debut titles under the Desperado/Image publishing partnership were Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot and a specially priced preview book, Desperado Primer, which gave readers a chance to sample the talent assembled under the Desperado umbrella. (The Desperado Primer featured stories written by Paul Jenkins, with art by Adam Hughes, Brian Stelfreeze, Cully Hamner, Phil Hester, Kelsey Shannon, and Jason Pearson, and a prologue to Tony Harris's Roundeye). In January 2005 they published Freak Show, a hardcover compilation of four vintage horror comics stories by the team of artist Bernie Wrightson & writer Bruce Jones. In addition, Pruett and Desperado revived Negative Burn, starting with two seasonal specials in 2005, and seguing into a monthly title in 2006. Pruett views the new incarnation of Negative Burn as a potential launching pad for new creators: \\"I'm offering Negative Burn as a way for a new creator to break in with us. If a creator shows promise and potential with his/her short story contributions then I might try to find them work with an already established creator or title in our library of titles.... I believe there needs to be an outlet for new talent... and [I] will try to do what I can to help them.\\" In March 2007, Desperado separated from Image after a two-and-a- half-year publishing partnership to become a self-sufficient publishing entity. (Negative Burn volume two's first eleven issues were published by Image.) As such, Desperado would publish under its own banner. In 2009, Desperado was acquired by IDW Publishing as a new imprint.\\"Desperado joins IDW,\\" The Beat (11/23/2009). Desperado also produced a line of art books, which kicked off with the Eisner Award-winning The Art of Brian Bolland. Other titles include Archetype: The Art of Tim Bradstreet, The Art of P. Craig Russell, and The Art of Joe Jusko. In 2011, in collaboration with IDW, they published Jeffrey Jones: A Life In Art.

The strike, organized by the Western Federation of Miners, was the first unionized strike within the Copper Country. It was called to achieve goals of shorter work days, higher wages, union recognition, and to maintain family mining groups. The strike lasted just over nine months, including the Italian Hall disaster on Christmas Eve, and ended with the union being effectively driven out of the Keweenaw Peninsula. While unsuccessful, the strike is considered a turning point in the history of the Copper Country. Background The Keweenaw Peninsula is the site of many rich native copper deposits. This copper was originally mined by native miners, and many French and British explorers noted the richness of the deposits in the area. Douglass Houghton explored the area in 1831 and 1832, and surveyed the peninsula in 1840 as Michigan State Geologist. Houghton's report of 1841 spent more than twenty-seven pages discussing the copper and copper ore. He famously concluded: \\"the copper ores are not only of superior quality, but also that their associations are such as to render them easily reduced.\\" He noted that samples of ore he had tested were richer than the copper ore being then mined in Cornwall.Bradish, Alvah, Memoir of Douglass Houghton, 1889. Appendix, \\"The Fourth Annual Report,\\" pp. 156-200. Houghton's report prompted a major rush of settlers to the peninsula.Lankton, Larry and Hyde, Charles: Old Reliable, an Illustrated History of the Quincy Mining Company, 1982 While most of the early mines failed, a few became successful, and eventually several major mines became established. The Copper Country quickly became the first major copper mining region in the United States. By 1913, the majority of copper in the Copper Country was produced by three companies: the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, by far the largest and richest mine in the Copper Country, as well as the Quincy Mine and the mines owned by the Copper Range Company. Most early successful mines were operated by Cornish miners. At the time, many mines in Cornwall were failing, and Cornish miners began to travel to newer mining regions around the world. Cornish miners brought with them a system of mine operations based on contracts.Lankton, Larry, Cradle to Grave: Life, Work, and Death at the Lake Superior Copper Mines, 1993. In this system, miners formed working groups (usually consisting of family members) which then contracted with mine operators to perform specific mining activities. Typically, miners were paid by the cubic fathom of mine rock extracted, at rates designated in their contracts. Because of the Cornish influence in the Copper Country mines, the contract system was also used in the Copper Country. However, contracts were only used with miners, who identified and blasted out copper-bearing rock. Trammers, whose job was to remove the blasted-out rock in heavy tram cars, were not paid on a contract, and were often considered to be a \\"lower class\\" of worker.Lehto, Steve, Death's Door: The Truth Behind Michigan's Largest Mass Murder, 2006. Major issues Several major issues contributed to the strike of 1913‚Äì14. One of the major complaints was the paternalism of the mines. The Copper Country copper mines operated a heavily paternalistic system, in which the mines watched closely over workers' lives both in and out of the mines. Historically, this developed for several reasons. Early mines in the distant Keweenaw wilderness had no nearby towns to supply their needs, and so the mines provided all services themselves. Most mines provided housing and schooling for miners and their families, as well as doctors, hospitalization, and even the construction of roads. Houses were assigned with preference to miners and other skilled laborers (as opposed to trammers), and to men with families (as opposed to single men). Additionally, most houses were given to certain favored ethnic groups, especially non-immigrants and Cornishmen. In exchange, miners were expected to act as the mines desired. Miners who fought, drank excessively, or were otherwise found to act improperly could be fired by the mines at any time. A one-man drill in operation Another major complaint was the one-man drill. In a system of hard-rock mining inherited from Cornish mines, miners drilled blast holes in a three-man team. One man held a steel drill, while two other men took turns hitting the steel with sledgehammers. Mines began to look for improvements to this system as early as the 1870s. The first improvement came with the \\"two man drill\\", which was a mechanical drill operated by compressed air. This drill was much more efficient than the three- man system, but still required two men to set up and operate. In addition, some mines allowed three men to work on the drill. As a result, the changeover from the three-man system to the two-man drill was relatively smooth. By 1913, mines were beginning to replace two man drills with \\"one man drills\\", which required only one man to operate and move. Miners had two major issues with the one man drill. First, the drill broke apart the historical family mining teams, leaving miners unemployed and bringing less income into a family. Second, a miner with a one-man drill operated alone. Any accidents which happened were likely to go undiscovered until many hours later, whereas under the old system a family member would be nearby to help. The final major issues concerned working hours, wages, and child labor. Miners typically worked 10- to 12-hour shifts in the mines, with one day off per week. Although the old contract system remained, most mines manipulated contracts so that all miners made effectively the same amount per month, subtracting expenses for candles or lamps, steels used in drills, and other materials required for mining. At the same time, many new copper mines had opened in the western United States. These mines were much richer than the Copper Country mines, and after several violent strikes led by the Western Federation of Miners, miners in the west made noticeably higher wages. Many young children were hired by the mines, to add to a family's income. As the social climate changed in the early 20th century, many workers began to clamor for an 8-hour day, reduced use of child labor, and higher wages matching those in newer western mines such as the Anaconda mine. While there were various factors inspiring union membership toward a strike, the WFM only asked its members to vote on two questions. The first was a demand for union recognition from management, and asking \\"for a conference with the employers to adjust wages, hours, and working conditions in the copper district of Michigan.\\" The membership also voted to \\"declare a strike\\" if management refused to \\"grant a conference or concessions.\\" After the vote was held, the WFM sent letters to the mines demanding the conference; the mine managers refused the request and the strike was called on July 23, 1913. The one-man drill was not mentioned in the referendum, nor was it mentioned in the initial letters sent to mine management. The strike Miners in the Keweenaw were not unionized until just before the 1913 strike. Several wildcat strikes had occurred in previous years, but these were done only at individual mines, and usually involved only one group of workers (especially trammers, who were paid less than miners for physically intensive work). In the late 19th century and early 20th century, several unions had attempted to organize locals within the Copper Country, but none of them succeeded. All unions were strongly opposed by the mine owners. The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) began organizing miners in the Copper Country in 1912. The pressing issues of wages, hours, and the one-man drill encouraged many miners to join the union, and the WFM quickly founded many locals. These locals and WFM organizers began calling for shorter working days, higher wages, and the return of the two-man drill. The Keweenaw chapters of the WFM voted to strike on July 23, 1913. The strike was called without support from the national WFM organization, which had just finished major strikes in the western mines, and had very little money left in their treasury.Thurner, Arthur:Strangers and Sojourners: A History of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, 1994 However, once the strike was called, the WFM began to collect donations and fees from its members to support the strike. The strike was the first strike to hit all Copper Country mines. After the first day of the strike, nearly all mines in the district were closed down, with mobs of strikers blocking access to the mines. Miners held daily parades to boost morale and show their strength. The mine owners, organized and led by James MacNaughton, manager of the Calumet and Hecla mining company, called for state governor Woodbridge Ferris to deploy national guard troops to keep the peace. The governor did so, which led to many confrontations, some violent, between strikers and troops. Accusations of violence and dirty dealing flew from both sides. Both the state and national governments attempted to intervene with support from the WFM, but the mine managers remained united in their refusal to negotiate with any union or to hire any union members. However, the mines did hire workers who were willing to tear up their union membership cards, and also imported many workers from other states or even countries. Some of these workers may have been impressed into service against their will. By August 1913, most mines had enough workers to operate on a limited basis. At the same time, miners were struggling from lack of pay and supplies. The strike was very costly for the WFM, which provided support to strikers based on need and family size. The WFM's coffers quickly emptied, leaving many miners and families living in poverty. A large number of families left the region entirely, looking for more work in the newly developing industrial centers of Detroit and Chicago. As the winter of 1913 began, the strike was weakening significantly. Seeberville affair An incident called the \\"Seeberville Affair\\" occurred on August 14, 1913, when John Kalan and John Stimac, two strikers, walked across mine property and were told that they could not cross the path by a deputized Trammer boss by the name of Humphrey Quick. They ignored his order, and so the guard notified his supervisor. The guard, another deputy, and some members of the Waddell-Mahon Detective Agency were sent to the residence of Kalan to bring the two men to the supervisor to talk. Kalan refused to go with them, and after going back inside the boarding house, the group of men began shooting at the house. Stimac and another man named Stanko Stepic were wounded. Two boarders with no connection to Kalan or Stimac were killed; Alois Tijan died on the scene and Steve Putrich the next day. The funeral for Tijan and Putrich was attended by 3500 to 5000 people, and the procession was led by labor activist Anna Clemenc. The deaths increased the intensity of the strike. In February 1914, three Waddell-Mahon guards and a deputy sheriff were convicted of manslaughter. The Italian Hall disaster On Christmas Eve 1913, the Women's Auxiliary of the WFM organized a Christmas party for strikers and their families. The union and many local citizens donated gifts for the children and money for the party supplies. The party was held in the upstairs ballroom of the Italian Hall, a building in Calumet which was owned by a mutual benefit society for Italians. The party was well attended, with hundreds of families attending, including many strikers' children, packed into the ballroom. At some point during the evening, according to most witnesses, an unidentified manLehto, Steve:Italian Hall: The Official Transcript of the Coroner's Inquest, 2007 stepped into the ballroom and shouted \\"Fire!\\", beginning a panic and stampede for the doors. The main exit from the ballroom was a steep stairway down to the front doors of the building. In the ensuing panic, 73 people were crushed to death in the stairwell, most of them children. The true identity of the person who shouted \\"Fire!\\" has never been established. There has been considerable speculation that the person was a member of the Citizens' Alliance, an organization of business owners, citizens, and mine owners who opposed the strike. Several witnesses recalled seeing a Citizens' Alliance button on the man's jacket. However, the inquest into the disaster reached no conclusion. Aftermath The disaster gave additional life to the strike, as rumors flew about the identity of the man who yelled \\"Fire!\\". Shortly afterwards, the president of the WFM, Charles Moyer, was shot and then forcibly placed on a train leaving the Keweenaw. However, support for the strike declined as organizers left (or were forced to leave) the Copper Country, the WFM ran out of money, and strikers' families experienced great hardships during the winter. The strikers voted to end the strike on April 13, 1914. Whereas the WFM reported having 9,000 members at the initial strike vote, only 2,500 members were left to vote on the referendum on calling off the strike. Mining companies required all strikers seeking a return to work to turn in or destroy their WFM membership cards. The strike was mostly unsuccessful in achieving its major goals. The mining companies continued introducing the one man drill, which eventually became a standard in all Copper Country mines. Collective bargaining was thoroughly rejected by the mines, leaving miners at the whim of the companies. Many miners simply left the Copper Country, or else returned to the mines for which they formerly worked on the mines' terms. However, many Copper Country mines did introduce an 8-hour day partway through the strike, for the miners who had stayed to work for them. This continued after the strike, when national labor legislation required shorter workdays. Labor legislation also limited use of child labor and mandated higher daily wages for miners and trammers. All mines eventually changed to a daily wage, leaving behind the old family-group contract system entirely. The strike is often considered a major turning point in the history of the Copper Country. Even though the mines were successful in the short term, the strike had demonstrated that mines could actually be affected by collective action. The strike also marked the end of the old paternalism of the mining companies. Workers' lives were no longer watched by the mines, and the mines cut back many services which they previously provided. The United Mine Workers of America-led Colorado Coalfield War ran concurrently with much of the Copper Country Strike, beginning in September 1913. Seven days following the conclusion of the Michigan strike, the Ludlow Massacre‚Äìperpetrated by National Guardsmen at the behest of mining company interests and killing over at least a dozen unarmed women and children‚Äìled to reforms in the treatment of miners nationwide. The mines of the Copper Country were unionized several decades following the strike. The International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW-CIO), a successor of the WFM, unionized the Copper Range Company mines in 1939, the Quincy Mine in 1941, and Calumet and Hecla mines in 1943, after several interventions by the National Labor Relations Board. A combination of low copper prices, depleted mines, competition from newer and richer mines, and continuing labor troubles eventually closed all of the Copper Country Mines. Calumet & Hecla closed its mines in 1969 after failing to reach an agreement with striking employees. That left the White Pine mine as the only remaining Copper Country mine in production; the White Pine mine closed in 1995.

Limerick in Ireland. This parish consists of two villages, Ashford and Raheenagh. The elevation of the parish varies from 1,184 ft. OS at Mauricetown and 1,082 ft. at Dromdeeveen to 200 ft. OS at Ballintubber. The parish is overlooked by the Mullaghareirk Mountains. The patron saint of Killeedy is Saint Ita. Killeedy used to be known as Cluain Chreadhail but in later ages it had taken the name of Cill √≠de, the Church of Saint Ita, from a nunnery which was founded there in the sixth century. On 15 January of each year, the feast of St. Ita's Day is celebrated in Killeedy.  The villages  Located in Ashford is St. Ita's Church, a primary school, a Montessori and The Village Inn Pub. The Village Inn pub has had great success in Darts particularly in recent years winning the Desmond Darts League premier division two years in a row. They also host the annual James Kelly Memorial Darts tournament. The soccer pitch for St. Itas AFC is also in Ashford. The Ashford Queen of the West Festival was held during the summers from 1989 and throughout the 1990s as part of the local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club's fund raising activities. In Raheenagh, there is St Ita's Church, P√°irc √≠de Naofa (the GAA pitch), a primary school, the community centre, a sports complex, a shop, and a pub.  Sports  The sports played competitively in Killeedy are hurling, camogie, Gaelic football and soccer. The local GAA club is Killeedy GAA. The club is heavily concentrated on the game of hurling and camogie with a little Gaelic football also being played. They play in blue and white and their ground is called P√°irc √çde Naofa and is located in Raheenagh village. The pitch annually hosts the Munster and All-Ireland Junior B Club Hurling Championship final. The Killeedy club has won numerous west and county championships over the years but the pinnacle of their success came in 1980 when they won the County Senior Hurling Championship beating Patrickswell in the final. The following year, Killeedy man Paudie Fitzmaurice (one of the Killeedy Fitzmaurice brothers, along with his brother Willie Fitzmaurice) captained GAA to win the Munster Senior Hurling Championship. Another Killeedy man, Donie Flynn, was joint manager of the Limerick senior hurlers from 1988 to 1991. Killeedy currently compete at the Junior A grade in Limerick. Saint Ita's AFC are the local soccer club in Killeedy and were founded in 1990, Their pitch is located in Ashford village and they play in blue and white. The junior team competes in the Limerick Desmond League division one. St. Ita's have been joined at underage level for the past two seasons with neighboring club Feenagh AFC and go under the moniker of Bluebell United. St. Ita's greatest achievement thus far was their All-Ireland Women's Junior Cup victory in 2006 making them the first Limerick Desmond League side to achieve this. In that same year, their women's team also won the Division 1 title in a playoff against Ballingarry A.F.C. and competed in the first ever Women's Desmond Cup final in which they lost out on penalties to Ballingarry. Their Junior team have had good success also with one of their finest achievements being them reaching the Quarter Final of the Munster Junior Cup in the 2005/06 season where they were beaten by Clonmel Town who would go on to win the competition. As well as this they have won back to back Richard Hogan cups, the Division 2 and Division 3 league titles and the Division 2 league cup.  Landmarks and history  Field Marshal Count Peter Lacy was born in Killeedy in 1678. After fighting at the Siege of Limerick in 1691, he emigrated first to France with the Wild Geese, then Austria and finally Russia where he became a Field Marshal and served as governor of Livonia. His son Franz Moritz (Francis Maurice) von Lacy was a Field Marshal in Austrian service. In 1916, Thomas Shaughnessy was created the 1st Baron Shaughnessy of the City of Montreal in the Dominion of Canada and of Ashford (in Killeedy) in the County of Limerick. His father Tom Shaughnessy, who was a policeman and detective in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was a native of Ashford in Killeedy. Notable landmarks in Killeedy include St. Ita's Monastery and Cemetery, Killeedy Castle, the Mass Rock, Glenduff Castle, Glenquin Castle, Lough O'Ge and Ballagh Post Office.  Kantoher  Kantoher creamery was a major source of income for the parish. It was established in 1904 as a local Co-operative processing milk, and finding markets for by products such as cream, cheese, butter and later casein. The cooperative continued to diversify, opening up opportunities for its suppliers by setting up processing facilities for pigs, turkeys, ducks and later poultry. In 1991, Kantoher Creamery was taken over by locally based multinational Kerry Group. Kerry grew the business further but by 2005 decided to cease operations at the poultry plant, its final processing facility there, with the loss of over 300 jobs directly and a further 500 indirectly. Kerry Group continued to process the majority of the milk produced locally in Listowel. Kerry Group maintained support to network of local poultry producers in securing a processing co-operation with Western Brand in Mayo. It also provided support to the newly formed voluntary organisation, Kantoher Development Group, set up to provide sustainable employment for the local community. Kantoher Enterprise Park currently has six companies operating out of the site providing over 80 jobs directly and another 40 indirectly. The companies based there include BHSL (which has grown a business out of poultry manure and fluidised bed technology), McMahon Ecofuel (leveraging the 6,000 acres of trees planted locally), Tara Cladding (which originally supplied cladding for the building needs of the local farming community and now provides bus shelters with automatic battery recharging), Strand Foods (a chicken processing plant), Pet Vet (a veterinary practice), MEHS (an environmental group that provides consultancy services), F√ÅS/SOLAS (provides employment to over 12 people), and Killeedy Group Water Scheme (the local water group).

The party was an early advocate of the abolitionist cause and it broke away from the American Anti- Slavery Society (AASS) to advocate the view that the Constitution was an anti- slavery document. William Lloyd Garrison, leader of the AASS, held the contrary view, that the Constitution should be condemned as an evil pro- slavery document. The party included abolitionists who were willing to work within electoral politics to try to influence people to support their goals. By contrast, the radical Garrison opposed voting and working within the system. Many Liberty Party members joined the anti-slavery (but not abolitionist) Free Soil Party in 1848 and eventually helped establish the Republican Party in the 1850s.  Party origin  The party was announced in November 1839 and first gathered in Warsaw, New York. Its first national convention took place in Arcade, New York, on April 1, 1840. The Liberty Party nominated James G. Birney, a Kentuckian and former slaveholder, for President in 1840Willey 1886, p. 131. and 1844.Willey 1886, p. 175. The second nominating convention was held in August 1843 in Buffalo, New York. The Liberty Party platform of 1843 resolved \\"to regard and to treat\\" the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution \\"as utterly null and void, and consequently forming no part of the Constitution of the United States\\" on grounds of \\"natural right\\" (natural law). It also contained the following plank: > Resolved, That the Liberty Party ... will demand the absolute and > unqualified divorce of the general [i.e., federal] government from slavery, > and also the restoration of equality of rights among men, in every State > where the party exists, or may exist.The National Conventions and Platforms > of All Political Parties 1789-1905 by Thomas Hudson McKee p. 52  Support and influence  The party did not attract much support. In the 1840 election, Birney received only 6,797 votes and in the 1844 election 62,103 votes (2.3% of the popular vote). However, it may have thrown victory from Henry Clay to James Polk in the 1844 election, with Birney having received 15,800 votes in New York and Polk winning New York by 5,100 votes. If Clay had won New York, he would have had the majority of electoral votes instead of Polk. A third nominating convention was held in Syracuse, New York in October 1847, endorsing John P. Hale of New Hampshire with 103 votes (there Gerrit Smith received forty-four votes for the nomination, with another twelve scattered votes for others).The National Era 1847, p. 3. However, Hale later withdrew due to the subsequent events of 1848.The National Conventions and Platforms of All Political Parties 1789-1905 by Thomas Hudson McKee p. 70.  Candidates   Relationship to the Free Soil Party  In 1848, with the political sentiment stirred up by the Wilmot Proviso controversies and the \\"Barnburner\\" (abolitionist) faction of New York Democrats splitting off from the rest of the Democratic Party, there was the possibility of forming a much larger and more influential political grouping devoted to anti-slavery goals‚Äîbut not all of whom considered themselves to be primarily abolitionists as such, or were willing to work under the Liberty Party name. Therefore, many Liberty Party members met in Buffalo, New York, with other groups in August 1848 to form the Free Soil Party, a party that although opposed to slavery was not strictly speaking abolitionist. A minority which was not willing to merge with the Free Soil Party nominated Gerrit Smith as rump National Liberty Party candidate for 1848 at a convention held on June 14‚Äì15, 1848 in Buffalo.Smith 1848, p. 4. Smith went on to win 2,545 votes, less than 1% of the Free Soil vote total. The Free Soil Party later merged with the Republican Party in 1854, by which time many of the issues originally championed by the Liberty Party had become politically mainstream. A member of the Liberty Party who later rose to great political prominence as a Free-Soiler and Republican was Salmon P. Chase. Chase had joined the Liberty Party in 1841 and had a significant influence on the Liberty Party platform of 1843‚Äì1844 as well as organizing the Southern and Western Liberty Convention in Cincinnati in 1845, where a number of delegates from the Midwest and Upper South met. In order to broaden the appeal of the party, Chase advocated supplementing the almost purely religious and moral Liberty Party rhetoric of the 1840 election with political and constitutional analysis and wished the party to emphasize that its immediate goal was to withdraw all direct federal government support and recognition of slavery (or to \\"divorce\\" the federal government from slavery) as opposed to simply demanding the abolition of slavery everywhere in the United States (something which was beyond the legal power of the federal government to accomplish as the Constitution then existed). In 1847‚Äì1848, Chase was a strong supporter of the fusion movement which resulted in the formation of the Free Soil Party.Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War by Eric Foner, Oxford University Press (1970) . The Liberty Party continued to exist many years afterwards, despite most of its supporters having left to join less-religiously-motivated parties. In the absence of Chase, religious rhetoric in the party's official addresses and platforms increased. The 1848 platform strongly condemned the perceived attempts to moderate the party. That same year, the party began openly advocating various general moralistic policies, such as prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. Other than these religiously motivated restrictions on market activity, the party largely favored free trade and opposed tariffs. One year later, the twenty-second plank of the 1849 platform praised Lysander Spooner's book The Unconstitutionality of Slavery. In 1852, the party held its national convention on September 30 in Syracuse, New York. The presidential nominee that year was William Goodell of New York and his running mate was S. M. Bell of Virginia. The platform that year only had four planks. A state convention of the Liberty Party was held in February, 1853, in Syracuse. By 1856, very little of the Liberty Party remained after most of its members joined the Free Soil Party in 1848 and nearly of all what remained of the party joined the Republicans in 1854. The small remnant of the party renominated Gerrit Smith under the name of the \\"National Liberty Party\\". In 1860, the remnant of the party was also called the Radical Abolitionists. A convention of one hundred delegates was held in Convention Hall, Syracuse, New York, on August 29, 1860. Delegates were in attendance from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Several of the delegates were women. Gerrit Smith, despite his poor health, fought William Goodell in regard to the nomination for the presidency. In the end, Smith was nominated for president and Samuel McFarland from Pennsylvania was nominated for vice president. The ticket won 171 popular votes from Illinois and Ohio. In Ohio, a slate of presidential electors pledged to Smith ran with the name of the Union Party.

He travelled to Johannesburg in 1890, holding jobs on gold mines in the West Rand in the 1890s. Increasingly prominent as a trade union organiser, he became the official South African organiser of the ASE, the President of the Witwatersrand Trades and Labour Council and the Political Labour League in 1905, the Labour Representation Committee in 1906 and the South African Labour Party in 1909.Wessel Visser, 'Exporting Trade Unionism and Labour Politics: the British Influence on the early South African Labour Movement', New Contree 49 (2005), 145-62 Andrews was first elected as a Labour MP at the 1912 Georgetown by-election.

Andrews served as a Member of Parliament until his defeat at the 1915 general election. A fighter for the rights of ‚Ä≥White‚Ä≥ labour, he was always quick to complain when he perceived that an African, referred by him frequently as a ‚Ä≥Kaffir,‚Ä≥(by then already regarded as a pejorative term) might take away a job from a White man.Ibid,p.50 In 1915, he was elected as the first President of the International Socialist League, which formed when anti-war socialists split from the SALP.

In 1921, he became the first General Secretary of the Communist Party of South Africa, and in 1922 the editor of the party's newspaper The International. In 1925, he was elected as the first Secretary of the South African Trades Union Council.

It was built in 1611 for the Glasgow benefactor George Hutcheson and situated on the west bank of the River Kelvin.Hill, Laurence (1855) The Story of Partick Castle Description Writing in the early eighteenth century, Hamilton of Wishaw described the building: > \\"...where Kelvin falls into Clyde, is the house of Pertique, a well-built > and convenient house, well planted with barren timber and large gardens, > which are enclosed with stone walls, and which formerly belonged to George > Hutcheson in Glasgow, but now to John Crawford of Myltoun.\\"Hamilton, William > (1710) Description of the Sherrifdoms of Lanark & Renfrew According to the local historian James Napier, it was left empty in 1770 and was unroofed and in ruins by 1783.Napier, James (1873) Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partickp33 It was demolished during the 1830s. Another local writer records that its remains were removed in a single night to 'form dykes in the neighbouring fields'. This happened in 1836 or 1837.Strang, John (1856) Glasgow & Its Clubs Or Glimpses Of The Condition, Manners, Characters, & Oddities of the City During The Past & Present Century footnote to p479 Napier also provides an anecdotal description of the building in its later days when it was a tenanted property:- > The account of the house given to me by a person who had often been in it > when it was inhabited, was, that the under flat was partially sunk & > vaulted. The second flat was entered by a few steps up, and had a stone > floor laid on the arches. There were several apartments in this flat, which > formed a sort of hostelry. The top flat had a deal floor and consisted of a > large hall which was used for public gatherings, balls, and dancing parties, > and over this flat were attics, which were used as bedrooms and for holding > lumber. There was a well outside the house. The main entrance door was > covered with large-headed nails, so also was a two-leafed door which formed > the outer entrance to the grounds. The grounds being surrounded by a stone > wall.Napier, James (1873) Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick p33 A poem published locally (in the Glasgow Magazine or the Bee) in the nineteenth century describes it thus: > Lo, Partick Castle, drear and lone, > Stands like a silent looker-on, > Where Clyde and Kelvin meet; > The long rank grass waves o‚Äôer its walls; > No sound is heard within its halls, > Save noise of distant waterfalls, > Where children lavo their feet.\\"Alison, Robert (1892) The Anecdotage of > Glasgow The castle's remains are likely to lie under the south western end of the Tesco development site in Partick. The site was most recently a scrapyard but before that a dyeworks, a foundry and a laundry. Unlike most of the old village of Partick, the castle's site was not removed by the excavations involved in the construction of the now disused Partick Central railway station. Rather, the castle site's solum was preserved under the aforementioned industrial buildings. As part of Scottish Water's Glasgow environmental improvement programme part of the castle was uncovered & excavated by GUARD Archaeology.A Googlemap-based view of the Castle's location can be found here: https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa;=0&msid;=110491576867789534694.0004544752f882a052ad1  Bishop's Castle  Coat of arms of the Burgh of Partick, showing the castle and mitre of the Bishop of Glasgow According to some sources, the site of Hutcheson's building was also the site of a castle and country residence of the Bishops of Glasgow. This is the castle depicted on the former Burgh of Partick's coat of arms. In 1136, King David had granted to the land of Partick (Perdeyc) to the See of Glasgow. In 1362, a settlement of a dispute between the Bishop and his chapter house was made at his manor-house of Perthic.Napier, James (1873) Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick p21 Glasgow's Bishops continued to use their residence in Partick until the reformation in 1560, when Bishop James Beaton II fled to France from there, taking with him the sacred relics from Glasgow Cathedral.Greenhorne, William (1928) History of Partick 550‚Äì1912 pp10-11 The remains of that castle may have been discovered near the mouth of the River Kelvin during work to install sewage pipes in 2016. At the marriage of Sir George Elphinstone of Blythswood to Agnes Boyd in 1600, James VI promised the couple a bigger house. Sir George was given the New Park of Partick in order to manage the woodland, introduce deer, and build an 'ample' house for himself and for the king to resort to after hunting. This may have built on the site of the Bishop's residence.CSP Sct., xiii, n. 552: RMS, vi, no. 1110  Dark Ages Royal residence  There is some evidence that Partick was an important centre for the Kings of Alt Clut/Strathclyde. According to the Cistercian monk and hagiographer of St Kentigern, Jocelin of Furness, King Rhydderch had a residence in 'Pertnech' (Partick). Some archaeologists have deduced that the royal Partick estate was part of a larger elite centre of the kingdom, which included the ecclesiastical centre just across the River Clyde at Govan. The lands of Partick remained royal property until King David granted them to the Bishops of Glasgow.Macquarrie, Alan (1993) The Kings of Strathclyde, c.400‚Äì1018 Pp.1‚Äì19 in Medieval Scotland: Government, Lordship and Community: Studies Presented to G.W.S. Barrow. Edited by A. Grant and K.J. Stringer There is no primary evidence that the site of Hutcheson's castle was the same as this royal residence.

Knockouts are full-service grooming salons with a boxing (and mixed martial arts)/sex appeal theme targeting men seeking an alternative to the cut-rate chain salons. The Today Show (NBC TV), The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch (CNBC) and other media have compared Knockouts to Hooters restaurants for the sex appeal/entertainment angle used to engage customers, labeling Knockouts ‚Äúthe Hooters of Haircutting.‚Äù The salons have a gym/warehouse-like decor with faux boxing ring posts and ropes and a brick wall helping to define the space, as well as boxing photos and memorabilia on the walls. There are flat-screen televisions at each grooming station and in the waiting area. These are usually tuned to sports programs, but are individually controlled by the customer. Knockouts employs an attractive all- female staff of licensed hair stylists and massage therapists. The services include haircuts, hair coloring, waxing, manicures, pedicures, and six types of massage therapy. Grooming products are also available for purchase. Some locations also offer hair replacement and facial shaves. Knockouts salons provide a free beverage to customers while they wait, including water, sports drinks and beer (where legally permitted).

It inhabits Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. It is a social animal, living in groups of 20-42 members.  Description  The Yucatan spider monkey weighs around 9 kg, making it one of the largest of the New World monkeys. It has long arms and a prehensile tail, which can support its own weight. The body is long and slender and covered with black hair, which is coarse and often looks matted. The fur is somewhat paler than that of the Mexican spider monkey. There are usually tan-coloured markings around the eyes and chin, and whiskers around the head area.  Ecology   Social groups  The Yucatan spider monkey is very social, living in groups of anywhere between 10 and 100 members (20-42 members on average). These groups are typically dominated by females, one of whom plans foraging routes for the rest of the group. Male-male relationship have also been documented. In these there is a focus on physical behaviour such as grooming, embracing, arm-wrapping, and grappling. Though most of these actions are reciprocated between the two males, the most successful bonds tend to be between males of similar ages, with pronounced differences in male-male relationships with a larger age gap (between individuals of <10 years and ‚â• 14 years). Actions performed between males of similar ages showed that the affection was beneficial for both of the monkeys, while in the relationships with larger age differences, a lot more affection was given by the younger male than was received, possibly showing the value of respect of elders in groups.  Reproduction and lifespan  Yucatan spider monkeys reach an average age of 25 years in wild, while in captivity this is closer to 35 years. A female Yucatan spider monkey will produce a baby once every few years. The infant monkey is completely black, and will cling to its mother‚Äôs back for the first two years of its life. It will also only start eating fruit at around two years old.  Diet  The Yucatan monkey is frugivorous, with a diet consisting of around 90% fruit and 10% eggs and insects. In captivity, the Yucatan spider monkey‚Äôs diet generally consists of fruits, dog food, bread and a few vegetables, such as carrots and lettuce. The Yucatan spider monkey moves in straight lines towards its food, and is able to orient its movement to foraging areas invisible from its current vantage point. Individuals consistently plan out foraging areas ahead of time. Foraging behaviour after a natural disaster (a hurricane) showed increased splitting up into smaller sub-groups. Less time was spent moving, and the main food source changed from fruit to leaves.  Conservation  The Yucatan spider monkey is classified as Endangered by the IUCN due to ongoing rapid population decline (totalling well over 5-% over three generations) caused by continued habitat loss.

The Texan Santa Fe Expedition crossed the river at the site of present-day Wichita Falls in 1841 and found a large Wichita Indian village at the site; the river was later named after the tribe. Today, the largest human settlement on the river is the city of Wichita Falls, which was named after a five-foot waterfall on the river that later washed away in a flood in 1886. The city after nearly 100 years of visitors wanting to visit the non-existent falls built an artificial waterfall beside the river in Lucy Park.

The restored \\"Falls\\" of the Wichita River in Lucy Park, Wichita Falls, Texas, off Interstate 44. The river is dammed in Archer County, forming Lake Diversion, and in Baylor County, forming Lake Kemp; there are also two small reservoirs on the river in Wichita County, one furnishing water for the town of Iowa Park and the other providing water for local irrigation. The Wichita River has three tributaries; the Wichita proper, as stated above, is formed by the confluence of its North and South Forks.

The film is an adaptation of Stefan Zweig's 1922 novella of the same name which was also adapted in 1948 by screenwriter Howard Koch. The film stars Xu and Jiang Wen as lovers during the 1930s and 1940s in Beijing. The film was produced by Asian Union Film & Media. Xu Jinglei won the Best Director award for the film at the 2004 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival.  Script  Originally the film's story was to have taken place in more recent times, spanning the 1970s through the 1990s. However, Xu moved the film's setting several decades back in time, to avoid dealing with social issues such as unmarried mothers and prostitution during the Cultural Revolution that ended in the 1970s, to avoid arousing the suspicions of Chinese censors. Xu also decided to use Beijing as the primary setting over cities like Shanghai (which she felt was overly colonial), Chongqing, and Nanjing (both of which were too turbulent during the war to adequately serve as the setting for a love story). Additionally, Xu felt that Beijing would offer a distinct visual perspective that would have been absent in other Chinese cities. Story In the winter of 1948 in Beijing, a renowned writer (Jiang Wen) receives a letter from an unknown woman on his birthday. As he reads the letter, a female voiceover begins to recount a relationship he has forgotten. The woman, a Miss Jiang, tells of her first infatuation with the writer when she was in her early teens, when she was his neighbour at a siheyuan. When she moved back to Beijing years later as a student at the Peking Women's College, she had a brief liaison with him, after which she became pregnant. Days later, the writer had completely forgotten about her since he did not make the connection that she was his childhood neighbour. She gave birth to their son in Sichuan, during the war-torn years of the Second Sino-Japanese war. When she moved back to Beijing eight years later, after the war, she became a dance hostess to support her son. Although the two had another chance encounter, the writer could not recognize her after so many years. They had one last liaison again. Though finding her familiar, the writer failed to pin down her identity. On the day after their son dies in an illness, she decides to write this letter to be posted after her death, to let him know of their existence.  Cast  * Xu Jinglei as Miss Jiang.

When punk emerged, it ‚Äúdid not appropriate socialism as its goal‚Äù; instead, it embraced ‚Äúnihilism‚Äù, and focused on keeping the memories of past abuses alive, and accusing all of Spanish society of collaborating with the \\"fascist regime\\".Drogas, Sexo, Y Un Dictador Muerto: 1978 on Vinyl in Spain. SHIT FI dot. http://www.shit-fi.com/Articles/Spain1978/Spain1978.htm The early punk scene included a range of marginalized and outcast people, including workers, unemployed, leftists, anarchists, queers, dykes, poseurs, scroungers, and petty criminals. The scenes varied by city. In Madrid, which had been the power center of the Falangist party, the punk scene was like ‚Äúa release valve‚Äù for the formerly repressed youth. In Barcelona, a city which had a particularly ‚Äúmarginalized status under Franco‚Äù, because he suppressed the area‚Äôs ‚ÄúCatalan language and culture‚Äù, the youth felt an ‚Äúexclusion from mainstream society‚Äù that enabled them to come together and form a punk subculture.Drogas, Sexo, Y Un Dictador Muerto: 1978 on Vinyl in Spain. SHIT FI dot. http://www.shit-fi.com/Articles/Spain1978/Spain1978.htm The first independently released Spanish punk disc was a 45 RPM record by Almen TNT in 1979. The song, which sounded like the US band The Stooges stated that no one believed in revolution anymore, and it criticized the emerging consumer culture in Spain, as people flocked to the new department stores. The early Spanish punk records, most of which emerged in the explosion of punk in 1978, often reached back to \\"old-fashioned 50s rock-n-roll to glam to early metal to Detroit‚Äôs hard protopunk\\", creating an aggressive mix of fuzz guitar, jagged sounds, and crude Spanish slang lyrics.Drogas, Sexo, Y Un Dictador Muerto: 1978 on Vinyl in Spain. SHIT FI dot. http://www.shit- fi.com/Articles/Spain1978/Spain1978.htm The first references to punk in Spain, is usually cited as Kaka deluxe and La Banda Trapera del Rio. There was three big scenes in Spain of punk rock: in Madrid (some bands are considered inside of \\"la movida\\"), Basque country (also called Basque Radical Rock) and Barcelona (more oriented to hardcore punk) one of the most important punk bands in Spanish history was La Polla Records.  Hardcore Punk  In Spain, among the best known hardcore groups are HHH, Subterranean Kids, TDeK, GRB, 24 Ideas and X-Milk among others, which are characterized by also having parts of fast punk, which demonstrate the link between punk and hardcore. . Other groups to highlight would be El Coraz√≥n del Sapo, Nevergood, Nuevenoventaicinco, groups from the Aragonese scene. However, other groups, less known to the general public, but no less important, such as MG-15 and √öltimo Gobierno, which played d-beat, forerunners of this genre in the State, must be named; or the wave of Catalan hardcore groups from the 1980s, such as Anti / Dogmatikss, GRB, L'Odi Social, Subterranean Kids, HHH, Rouse and, already in the 1990s, Corn Flakes, Innocents, Tropel Nat, 24 Ideas , X-Milk, Sowplot. In the Basque Country there were also classic groups related to this genre such as BAP !! (Anti Polizialak Brigade), Eskoria-tza, Soziety Alkoholika or Noise of Rage, influenced by metal. Also noteworthy at the beginning of the most hardcore metal scene with groups like Prap's. Although it would be necessary to add bands that changed the scene a lot at different times, such as 24 Ideas, a Barcelona band that introduced New York Hardcore with a straight edge influence in the State; Alarma Social, a group from Burgos, one of the first to go out, Shorebreak with the signing in Good Life, seemed to open up the state scene to Europe, something that has hardly been seen since; and it would also be necessary to highlight all the number and enormous number of bands from within punk, hardcore, crust, etc. They are the ones that have achieved the most the state scene is present outside this country, bands like Answer, Ictus, Machetazo, Looking For an Answer, ZInc, Ekkaia, Disface, Disflesh, Defeat Proud'z, Insomnia, √úber, Horr√∂r, Antiplayax , Black Panda, Alert! and a very long etc. References Spain Spanish culture Spain Spanish punk rock groups ","title":"Punk rock in Spain"},{"id":"19118693","text":"Akombo Ukeyima (born November 25, 1987) is a Nigerian footballer, who currently plays for Lobi Stars F.C..

Following the reorganization of its manufacturer and change in military nomenclature, the engine became known as the Bramo 322. It was a result of a series of modifications to the original Bristol Jupiter IV design, which Siemens licensed in 1929. The first modifications were to \\"Germanize\\" the dimensions, producing the Sh.20 and Sh.21. The design was then bored out to produce the 950 hp (708 kW) Sh.22 in 1930. Like the Jupiter, the Sh.22 featured a rather \\"old\\" looking arrangement with rather prominent valve pushrods on the front of the engine. In the mid-1930s the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) rationalized engine naming, and Bramo was given the 300-block of numbers, the Sh.14 and Sh.22 becoming the Bramo 314 and 322 respectively.

He was the only son of Rudolph, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his second wife Magdalene, daughter of John VII, Count of Oldenburg. Life John succeeded his father in Anhalt-Zerbst at only four months of age; during his long minority, his paternal uncle Augustus of Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau acted as regent in the principality. John's education was supervised primarily by his mother. Political instability caused by warfare during the Thirty Years War caused John to be educated in Zerbst, Coswig, and Wittenberg at various times. From 1633 he continued his education at the court of his maternal uncle Anthony G√ºnther, Count of Oldenburg. Immediately after he reached adulthood and formally assumed the government of his state, John made Lutheranism the official religion of Zerbst. He increased the size of his principality noticeably by acquiring various fiefs. In 1642 his uncle Louis of Anhalt- K√∂then, admitted John to the Fruitbearing Society together with the Hofrat Konrad Balthasar Pichtel and the Hofjunker Joachim von Boeselager.

He was a member of notable rock bands active in former Yugoslavia. He closely collaborates with Dejan Cukiƒá and Bilja Krstiƒá and has his own projects TeodulIja and Divine Sound, focusing on ambiental, ethno and spiritual music.  Biography  Isakoviƒá was born in Valjevo in 1958 and moved to Belgrade in 1961. His first interests in music came about 1970 when his school friend, today well known guitar player and producer Du≈°an \\"Duda\\" Bezuha needed a rhythm guitarist for his rhythm and blues band. Having finished the Sixth Belgrade high school Isakoviƒá joined the acoustic rock band Suncokret as a replacement for Bata Sokiƒá who went to serve the army. Isakoviƒá left the band in 1978. With former Tilt members Dejan Cukiƒá (vocals) and Predrag Jakovljeviƒá (guitar), guitarist Nenad Stamatoviƒá, Isakoviƒá formed Bulevar. The band got the name \\"Bulevar\\" because all of the members lived near The Boulevard Of Revolution in Belgrade. The band performed as an opening act for Riblja ƒåorba including the September 1, 1979 appearance which was one of the band's major appearances. In the meantime the band Zvuk Ulice disbanded and their keyboard player Dragan Mitriƒá joined the band. Soon after the band, with the help of Riblja ƒåorba guitarist Momƒçilo Bajagiƒá recorded their first single \\"Moje bezvezne stvari\\", but due to the illness of the president Josip Broz Tito, it was released in 1980 by Jugoton. The next single \\"Nesta≈°ni deƒçaci\\" became one of the anthems of new wave music in Yugoslavia and was included on the Jugoton compilation Svi mar≈° na ples!. In the meantime, the band started writing material for their debut record which was released through PGP RTB records in 1981. Lo≈° i mlad was produced by the band themselves with the help of Tahir Durhali. The next album Mala noƒána panika did not get a live tour as Mitriƒá, Stamatoviƒá and Cukiƒá had to go to serve the army. The last concert the band held was in Skopje in 1982 and ceased to exist. Mitriƒá and Isakoviƒá joined the off project band Propaganda and released one album, Apatija javnosti in 1982. Isakoviƒá, beside bass, also played rhythm guitar. After Bulevar disbanded Isakoviƒá went to Idoli, as a replacement for Zdenko Kolar who went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army, the band was about to record a new album. Idoli members went to London and with producer Bob Painter recorded ƒåokolada. The album was a high success and was sold in about 350,000 copies. When ƒåokolada tour started, the relationship between the band members became colder and after the Ljubljana show, due to a quarrel, Idoli disbanded. Isakoviƒá together with Zdenko Kolar recorded bass sections on the ≈†est dana juna soundtrack album which was released as an Idoli record. In 1986 Isakoviƒá went to serve the army and on his returned joined the Krstiƒá & ≈†aper backing band Unutra≈°nja Imperija and recorded the Poslednja mladost u Jugoslaviji album released by Jugoton in 1987. Later he toured with Bisera Veletanliƒá in the USSR and employed as a fireman in Belgrade. When Dejan Cukiƒá left Bajaga & Instruktori he decided to start a solo career and formed his backing band Spori Ritam Band. The lineup featured Isakoviƒá on bass, Dragoljub ƒêuriƒçiƒá on drums, Dragan Mitriƒá on keyboards, Sa≈°a Lokner on snare drums and Safet Petrovac on guitar. Together they released the Spori ritam album in 1987. He left Spori Ritam Band in 1989. Together with Dragoljub ƒêuriƒçiƒá, Isakoviƒá went to Kerber, hard rock band from Ni≈°. With Kerber he recorded live album 121288 and studio album Peta strana sveta. He left the band in 1992 and returned to Cukiƒá's Spori Ritam Band and played until 2003. In 1993 Isakoviƒá moved to Prague where he worked in a toy factory. When he came back to Yugoslavia, he appeared in the movie Underground. During a trip to India Isakoviƒá got interested into ambiental and ethnic music. In 1996 he formed The Glissers with Ekatarina Velika keyboard player Margita Stefanoviƒá and Marija Mihajloviƒá from Spori Ritam Band. This is the first time Isakoviƒá used a computer for recording which made him more interested in computer technology. In 1997 came out the Dejan Cukiƒá & Spori Ritam Band live album Unplugged recorded live in Novi Sad. At the same time Isakoviƒá met Ljuba Ninkoviƒá who used to be the frontman of a famous acoustic band S Vremena Na Vreme. Together they recorded soundtracks for theater plays and commercial and TV music. The two with Bilja Krstiƒá recorded the album Bistrik on a Pentium I computer in 1999. Together they formed the Bistrik Orchestra which became Bilja Krstiƒá's backing band. The album was a huge success and the band toured Brazil, Russia, France, Italy and Greece. The following year Dejan Cukiƒá recorded a soundtrack for the Divlji med play which is actually a cover album of Bob Dylan's songs with lyrics in Serbian language. In 2001 with Ivica Stojanoviƒá, a friend from the First Belgrade Singers Company, Isakoviƒá started a project TeodulIja which was a combination of ethnic music and Christian Orthodox spiritual music. They released the Priƒçe iz davnina CD in 2002. Bilja Krstiƒá & Bistrik Orchestra participated the soundtrack album for Zona Zamfirova in 2001 and in 2003 released a studio album Zapisi. The Romani music band Kal recorded their debut album in 2005 with Isakoviƒá on bass. The self-titled album came out in 2006 through B92 records and Asphalt Tango Records. In the meantime Isakoviƒá started his own project Divine Sound which is a healing ambiental music band. The album Order of Love came out in April, 2005. It was created as music background for spoken word meditations by Vlado Iliƒá as part of family system therapy, following Dr Bert Hellinger's Systemic Constellations method. The CD contains five meditative compositions enriched by the voice of Marija Mihajloviƒá and native flute played by Milinko Ivanoviƒá. In September, 2005 Bilja Krstiƒá & Bistrik Orchestra started recording a new album released in 2007 entitled Tarpo≈°. A new TeodulIja album Vino istine came out in 2007. At the moment Isakoviƒá is composing, arranging, producing and recording new material for his musical project. He mostly works in his home studio in Belgrade.

Unlike kimchi, jangajji is non-fermented vegetables, usually pickled in soy sauce, soybean paste, or chili paste. Jangajji dishes are usually preserved for a long period of time, and served with a drizzle of sesame oil. Preserved foods like jangajji were developed to attain a certain level of vegetable consumption during the long, harsh winters on the Korean peninsula.  Etymology  Jangajji () is derived from Middle Korean jyangaetdihi (), that consists of the noun jyang (; \\"soy sauce\\" or \\"soybean paste\\"), the genitive postposition -ae (-), the inserted inter-siot -t- (--), and the noun dihi (; \\"kimchi\\").  Ingredients  Main ingredients vary according to region and temperature. Some examples are green garlic, garlic scapes, radish, cucumber, chili pepper leaves, chamoe, perilla leaves, and deodeok. Jangajji is usually pickled in soy sauce, soybean paste, or chili paste, but brine and diluted vinegar can also be used as the pickling liquid. Usually, vegetables are slightly dried or salted to prevent the addition of surplus moisture to the condiment. When served, jangajji is cut, then seasoned with sesame oil, sugar, and toasted sesame seed powder.

The village is in the Norfolk battle training area of the Ministry of Defence which is an area with restricted entry. Langford is about nine miles south of the town of Swaffham. History Langford has an entry in the Domesday Book of 1085,The Domesday Book, England's Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde, Norfolk, p. 186 in which it is recorded as Langaforde. The main landholder is named as Hugh de Montfort and the survey also states that there are two mills, a fishery, and two beehives. Evacuation During the Second World War, the village was taken over by the British Army when it was incorporated into the Stanford Battle Area. The military ranges were needed to prepare Allied infantry for Operation Overlord, (the Battle of Normandy in 1944). Though some villagers were said to be happy to give up their homes to help the British War effort, Information about the Evacuation the majority were less than enthusiastic with a number of heated village meetings and some refusing to leave the area. Breckland exodus - the forced evacuation of the Norfolk Battle Area 1942:Part 1 This was the subject of a book written by Lucille Reeve, one such person who refused to leave, under the pseudonym A Norfolk Woman called Farming, on a Battle Ground. Lucille Reeve - Eastern Daily Press However at the close of World War II, the former villagers were never allowed to return to their homes by the War Office. Most of the inhabitants of Langford were not landowners, and rented the houses and farmed the land belonging to the Walsingham estates. Though they had been promised that they could return to their homes after the war, the government later reneged on the promise and bought the land, threatening Walsingham with a compulsory purchase order. Breckland exodus - the forced evacuation of the Norfolk Battle Area 1942:Part 2 As the majority of the inhabitants were not landowners, they received very little in compensation, were put into council housing and many lost their livelihoods. They continued to fight for many years to return to their homes and farmland but the beginnings of the cold war and the need for dedicated training areas removed all chances of a return. Since the evacuation, the village and its parish remain within the Ministry of Defence's Thetford infantry training area. Access is not allowed without special permission. The Parish Church of St Andrew The parish church is a very simple affair made up of two cells which date from the Norman period.Norfolk 1: Norwich and North-East, by Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, Langford entry.

As of 2015, the Vietnamese community in Bulgaria numbers 2,600, including Bulgarian residents and/or citizens. They mainly live in the capital Sofia, but also in Plovdiv, Dimitrovgrad and Varna. Many Vietnamese people also live in Kozloduy. History The Vietnamese diaspora in Bulgaria dates to the 1960s. In 1950, Bulgaria and Vietnam had established diplomatic relations and signed a mutual agreement to co-operate in cultural and educational affairs. As a result, the first Vietnamese students arrived in Bulgaria in 1960. The main subjects that the Vietnamese came to study were agriculture, economics, tourism, humanities, arts, medicine and construction. According to an international agreement of 1980, Bulgaria, along with other Comecon members such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, accepted Vietnamese guest workers in the country as a relatively cheaper manual labour workforce. According to one estimate, over 35,000 Vietnamese people have worked in Bulgaria between 1980 and 1991, and 5,000 Vietnamese students have completed their higher education in various Bulgarian universities. Plattenbauten (–ø–∞–Ω–µ–ª–∫–∞; panelka) and mobile home hostels were built in 1984 in the Krasna Polyana municipality of Sofia to accommodate the Vietnamese; by 1990, the area had acquired the nickname \\"Little Saigon\\". The hostels are still known as \\"the Vietnamese hostels\\" today, although their demolition has been considered by the Capital Municipality as they have since decayed into an unregulated Roma-inhabited slum. The idea was to compensate Bulgaria's lack of sufficient manual workforce and at the same time to relieve Vietnam of some of its growing population, with the trained workers potentially coming back. In practice, however, this co-operation was subject to much corruption in Vietnam, with many members of its richest class of merchants paying bribes equivalent to around ‚Ç¨1,000 (in 1985) to be sent to Bulgaria, where they expanded their speculative business, engaging in black market trade, production of counterfeit goods such as jeans, etc. As a consequence, shortly after the democratic changes of 1989, Bulgaria arranged the accelerated return of most of the Vietnamese workers to Vietnam, effective in 1991. Of the thousands of Vietnamese, all but the students and those who had married in Bulgaria left. Since 1991, Bulgaria has been a target country for economic immigrants from Vietnam, as the average wages remained higher despite the country's difficulties in the 1990s. Along with the Chinese, Koreans, Arabs and other immigrants, the Vietnamese have established a presence among the vendors in Sofia's well-known and frequented bazaar Iliyantsi. The number of Vietnamese immigrants is constantly rising, although they are yet to feature more prominently in Bulgaria's social life and media. In 2008, it was widely reported and discussed that Bulgaria, now a European Union member, is again looking to employ Vietnamese workers, as unemployment in the country has been largely solved as an issue (with unemployment rates comparable to those in France or Belgium and lower than in Spain or Germany). and on the contrary, there is a lack of workers in the rapidly developing building and tourism branches in particular. Vietnamese would be offered jobs on contract terms with temporary residence in Bulgaria. Notable people * Ulyana Chan Vin (b. 1984), actress * Ani Hoang, singer.

P had been the manager of an educational establishment, but was dismissed after she informed her employer that she intended to undergo gender reassignment. A subsequent industrial tribunal agreed that P was indeed dismissed due to her gender reassignment. The tribunal did not, however, believe that she had a remedy under the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA). At the time, the SDA prohibited adverse treatment for men and women because they belonged to one sex or the other.Equality and Human Rights Commission: Transgender case decisions http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and- guidance/your-rights/transgender/transgender-case-decisions/ The tribunal asked the ECJ whether the Equal Treatment Directive - which states there should be \\"no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex\\" - applied where someone is changing or has changed their sex. In a landmark ruling, the ECJ made clear that changing sex is an aspect of sex: meaning dismissal related to gender reassignment is in breach of the Directive. As a member of the European Community, the UK is obliged to ensure UK law is always in accord with European Law (of which the Equal Treatment Directive is a part). When P's case returned to the tribunal, her discrimination complaint was upheld and she was financially compensated.European Court reports (1996) http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994J0013:EN:HTML, 61994J0013 Judgment of the Court of 30 April 1996. - P v S and Cornwall County Council. - Reference for a preliminary ruling: Industrial Tribunal, Truro - United Kingdom. - Equal treatment for men and women - Dismissal of a transsexual. - Case C-13/94.

The ECJ judgment was in April 1996, but it wasn't until early 1998 (following the change of government) that the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) decided to respond. The DfEE released a consultation on proposed legislation which asked, among other things, whether transsexual people should be allowed to work with children or vulnerable adults.Burns, Christine (15 February 1998) Outraged, Burns urged PFC's followers to write to their MPs and also to Cherie Blair: a discrimination and public law specialist and wife to the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair. More than 300 trans people and their supporters responded with a strong and unequivocal call to redraft the proposed legislation. As a consequence, Burns was invited to meet Margaret Hodge MP, the Minister for Education and Employment in the new Labour Government.

She was co- chair of the LGBT Health Summit 2010, and produced a mini documentary for the occasion.LGBT History Month (2010) \\"Hertfordshire Partnership NHS\\" Her recognised leadership and knowledge of trans people in healthcare was recognised by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which invited Burns to be the British representative on its international advisory panel. The panel had influence over the Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People's seventh edition. It also made advisory input to the submissions WPATH have made to the International Classification of Diseases revision process in the World Health Organisation.  Media reform  Burns has advocated for better media depiction of trans people, including Hayley Cropper on Coronation Street and Nadia Almada on Big Brother.Hogan, Dek and Christine Burns (September 2006).Nadia's Conundrum.

The Guardian She also supported people who were dealing with the media, including Councillor Ros Mitchell, who transitioned whilst sitting on Bristol's County Council.Burns, Christine (27 Jan 1998) \\"Putting the record straight on Ros\\" Mitchell faced unwanted press intrusion from her local newspaper in addition to criticism from the Guardian. During the spring of 1998, Burns collaborated in a BBC Home Ground programme (made by BBC Bristol) which documented Mitchell's transition. Writing on the PFC website, Burns claimed that an angry Labour Councillor threatened a BBC Politics correspondent with physical violence during production.Burns, Christine (16 February 1998) \\"All in a day's filming\\" In 1999, Sergeant Major Joanne Rushton revealed her intention to transition from male to female ‚Äì prompting Britain's Ministry of Defence to announce that transsexual people would be allowed to serve in the Armed Forces. Burns welcomed the news, but expressed concern about the Army's possible reaction to Sergeant Major Rushton entering into a relationship: \\"Joanne will physically be a woman but legally be a man ... Given the Army's ban on homosexuality, it is not clear whether she will be allowed to have sexual relations with a man or a woman - if anyone.\\"BBC News (2 August 1999)http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/409792.stm, UK Army backs sex-change soldiers In 2004, she responded to the BBC's coverage of murdered trans man Brandon Teena with a campaign to change editorial guidelines around gendered pronouns. Burns brought Tim Toulmin before the Parliamentary Forum shortly before he was promoted to the head of the Press Complaints Commission.Jones, Lynne (5 June 2003) She also researched and produced the PFC report \\"Transsexual People and the Press\\", which led the Press Complaints Commission to change its Editors' Code of Practice.Burns, Christine (2004). http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7789275/Transsexual%20People%20and%20the%20Press.pdf, Transsexual People and the Press: Collected Opinions from Transsexual People Themselves Following the media frenzy around Thomas Beatie's pregnancy in 2008, Burns defended the right of trans men to bear children: \\"That's like saying you can't be a woman and have a career ... The irony is we've had a debate in feminism about the idea that if men were able to have children we would be in a very different position and yet when it happens there is enormous fear.\\"Barkham, Patrick (28 March 2008) The Guardian  LGBT History Month and public speaking  Mark Rees interviewed by Christine Burns MBEIn 2005 Burns became involved in supporting LGBT History Month and contributed profiles on Mark Rees and Stephen Whittle to the charity's website.LGBT History Month (14 March 2011). http://lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/category/history/lgbt-people/inspirational- trans-people/ She also produced a lesson plan on gender variance.

It was built by the Midland Railway Company as part of the original Forster Square Railway Station, as a showpiece for the company's northern operations. Following the \\"golden age of steam\\" the hotel fell into disrepair until it was bought by Bradford entrepreneur John Pennington in 1992, who restored it and the hotel re-opened as the Pennington Midland Hotel in 1993. It was sold to Peel Hotels in December 1998, who returned it back to its original name. During its life, the hotel has played host to many famous guests, including Sir Henry Irving, an English stage actor, who died there in 1905.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets and Detroit Tigers. He was drafted by the Mets in the ninth round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft after attending Charleston Southern University. Amateur career Bobby Parnell was born on September 9, 1984 in Salisbury, North Carolina. His father, also named Robert, and his grandfather were both firefighters. At East Rowan High School in Granite Quarry, North Carolina, Parnell was primarily a third baseman. Parnell converted from shortstop to pitcher as a freshman with the Charleston Southern University Buccaneers. In 2004, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Despite still struggling to control his pitches even after three years of pitching in college, the New York Mets took the advice of Parnell's former American Legion coach and selected Parnell in the 9th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft with the 269th overall pick. Minor league career Parnell worked as a starter for the minor league teams in the Mets organization, pitching for the Brooklyn Cyclones, St. Lucie Mets, Binghamton Mets, and New Orleans Zephyrs. In three different leagues, Parnell has been named a mid-season All-Star. He earned the honor in the New York‚ÄìPenn League in 2005, the Florida State League in 2007, and the Eastern League in 2008. Major league career New York Mets (2008‚Äì2015) =2008= Parnell earned Eastern League All-Star honors again in .

He made his first major league start on August 8 against the San Diego Padres. He earned his first major league win as a starter in his second start on August 14, pitching six innings, giving up only three hits, and striking out seven.

Parnell, in his short major league career, has already developed a reputation for being a flamethrower. His fastballs consistently touch the high-90s, sometimes eclipsing 100 MPH. On August 18, 2010, in a game against the Houston Astros, Parnell hit 102.5 MPH on the radar gun, the fastest pitch in the major leagues in 2010 up to that point. Cincinnati Reds rookie Aroldis Chapman set the new mark on August 31, 2010 at 103.9 MPH.

Parnell made his return to the major leagues in a June 13 win against the Atlanta Braves at Citi Field. Parnell pitched well in the relief appearance and said of his return, \\"It sent chills up my spine.\\" However, Parnell's fastball velocity was noticeably lower than before his surgery and manager Terry Collins described Parnell as looking \\"rusty.\\" On August 18, 2015, after pitching poorly in a weekend series against the Pittsburgh Pirates and taking two losses, (along with a 14.14 ERA in his last 10 appearances) he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with arm fatigue.

His secondary pitch and main breaking ball in 2011 was a high-80s slider, but in 2012 he dropped the pitch in favor of a mid-80s knuckle curve. He has also toyed in the past with a splitter, but he rarely uses it. For 2012, he also developed a two-seam fastball. Personal life On January 29, 2010, Parnell proposed to his longtime girlfriend Maegan Walker in Charleston, South Carolina. The couple was married on November 11, 2011 at a Methodist church in Concord, North Carolina. In 2010, Parnell and his then-fianc√©e adopted a golden retriever-yellow lab mix from North Shore Animal League which they named \\"Abby.\\" As of 2010, the couple was living in Parnell's hometown of Salisbury.

The line currently operates between the Village of Harper's Choice in Columbia and Harbor East, mostly via US-29 and US-40, serving The Mall in Columbia and Catonsville. History Bus on MTA Route 150 on Route 40 in Ellicott City, MD with the new BaltimoreLink livery. In 1898, service operated by the Columbia and Maryland Railway began between Baltimore and Ellicott City. The intention was to operate a passenger railroad service between Baltimore and Washington. But it was never extended to any location past Ellicott City.http://www.btco.net/Routes/9n14Edmo.html The line was operated as Route 14 until 1927, when service to Ellicott City was redesignated Route 9. The No. 9 Streetcar operated between Ellicott City and Baltimore up until 1952, when it was shortened to a shuttle that operated between Ellicott City and Catonsville only. The shuttle streetcar service lasted until 1955, when it was converted into a shuttle bus. The shuttle bus operation was discontinued in 1957. Later, Route 929, a commuter bus route marketed as a service for Columbia to Washington commuters, operated several trips each day that originated in Baltimore, and operated to Columbia through Ellicott City before continuing to Washington. Though printed in the schedules, this line was not advertised for this purpose. Route 12 started providing express service from both the western and eastern suburbs of Baltimore in 1972. The west side service operated from a park-and-ride lot on US-40 near Westview Mall, and the eastern end service from one on Eastern Boulevard known as the Essex Park-and Ride. In 1991, the no. 12 line was redesignated, and west side service was renamed to \\"Route 150\\" and east side service to Route 160. Neither Route 12 nor Route 150 were ever intended to serve Howard County. Route 150's origin would later be moved to the intersection of US-40 and Rolling Road. Selected trips also operated from near Security Square Mall, but these were eliminated in 1995. During the early 2000s, the line was eventually extended to the Long Gate Park-and-Ride lot in Ellicott City (near US-29 and Maryland Route 103), with two-way service during rush hour to allow for reverse commuters who worked in Ellicott City and the second connection between MTA to Howard Transit, the other being at BWI Airport, where the Light Rail and Bus Route 17 meet Howard Transit's Silver Line. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, MTA proposed to completely eliminate Route 150, and not to provide any bus service to Ellicott City, requiring riders who wished to reach Ellicott City from Baltimore to spend several hours each way on buses.Worries of life without a bus - Career and Workplace, Maryland, Metropolitan Transportation Authority - baltimoresun.com The line at the time was reported as having 143 daily riders, and had required a taxpayer subsidy of $8.71 per boarding,https://www.latimes.com/bal-ho.bus19jun19,0,7324528.story and was seen as a \\"failed experiment.\\"http://www.courant.com/news/traffic/bal- te.md.buses09jun09,0,4331322.story Due to public outcry, four round trips each day (two AM and two PM) were retained and operate to this day.

Shortly after the end of World War II, on 1 October 1945, the organization named l'Amicale des d√©port√©s politiques de la R√©sistance de Mauthausen et de ses kommandos d√©pendants was founded. The original members were survivors of CC Mauthausen-Gusen and its subcamps. Amicale de Mauthausen discovered that 198,000 people of 25 different nationalities (10,000 of them French) were deported to CC Mauthausen. 118,000 people died from forced labor or in one of the gas chambers, which were installed inside of the camp. Particularly in the postwar years, but also today, the Amicale helps families of the missing and their children. Since its founding, Amicale has been teaching about the crimes of national socialism. Amicale appears at various international events, e.g., commemorations of the liberation of Mauthausen. They also arrange excursions to Mauthausen. In the year 2000, there was an official generation change. Because of their age, the survivors of the camp handed over their functions to their children. There are still about 500 deportees and their families working for the association to commemorate their suffering. The French Amical is a member of the Comit√© International de Mauthausen with around 1700 members in total. The head office is in Paris, but there are many members elsewhere too. At the head office, there is the possibility for Austrians to serve for a short time instead of the military service as an Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant. The first Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant started to work in Paris on 1 September 2008.

Wongsawat promptly resigns. } The PPP won the December 2007 general election. Though it became the largest party in the House, it did not gain an absolute majority. PPP became the leading party when five other smaller parties, previously allies of Thaksin Shinawatra, agreed to join the coalition government under Samak Sundaravej. The coalition government vowed to amend the 2007 constitution which they called undemocratic, prompting PAD to resume protests against the constitutional amendment plan after having suspended its movement after the 2006 coup. PAD charged that the amendment was aimed at revoking charges against Thaksin and election fraud charges by PPP executive members. The Samak government suspended its amendment plan, yet PAD vowed to continue their protest, calling for Samak Sundaravej's resignation, noting that during his election campaign, he had declared himself a nominee of Thaksin. Tensions escalated when PAD seized Government House. Samak was forced to resign in September after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of being an employee of a television cooking program after he became the prime minister. PPP deputy leader Somchai Wongsawat, vice president of PPP and a brother-in-law of Thaksin, became the new prime minister. This change prompted continued PAD protests. The protests led to violent clashes between the police, PAD, and anti-PAD protesters on 7 October as the government aimed to disperse them from blocking the entrances of the House. A PAD protester was killed by a grenade near the premier's office and a member of the PAD security forces was killed when his car exploded. Many protesters were also injured. As PAD was attacked, it stepped up its protests by seizing the government's temporary offices at Don Mueang Airport, and the seizure and closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport after the arrest of Chamlong Srimuang, one of its leaders. The sieges ended in December when the Constitutional Court dissolved the PPP and banned its executive board from political office after finding it guilty of election fraud. The Constitutional Court dissolved two coalition partners of the PPP on similar charges, which broke the coalition apart. Prime minister Somchai resigned. It is alleged that the army then urged MPs of a former PPP faction, the Friends of Newin Group, and MPs of the former PPP coalition partners to cross the aisle and form a coalition with the Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. After days of negotiations, Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the Democrat Party, was voted in by a margin of 235 in favor, 198 against. The People's Alliance for Democracy opposed to what it called the \\"Thaksin system\\", which is seen by some as the Thaksin' \\"autocracy\\", his domination of independent supervisory institutions and violations of human rights and the freedom of the press. It began the mass protest against Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 after the removal of the critical TV program of Sondhi Limthongkul. In 2008, PAD accused Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat of being proxies for Thaksin. Samak had announced that he was Thaksin's nominee during his election campaign, Somchai is Thaksin's brother-in-law, and several new Pheu Thai Party members are former TRT/PPP members. PAD was opposed to all attempts to reform the constitution in ways that would allow politicians banned from political office to re-enter politics, and to revoking the charges against Thaksin. PAD has also called for \\"new politics\\", a \\"new age of politics, free from the corrupted politicians\\". In May 2009, PAD founded its party, the New Politics Party. One of the PAD's major aims was to oppose what it considered the anti- monarchy movement, supposedly among some Thaksin supporters. PAD promoted the role of the king as the guard of the all people's power against the \\"corrupted politician\\". That is why PAD uses yellow, Rama IX's symbolic birthday colour, Monday, as its brand. Yet its ideology was blasted by some critics as \\"anti- democratic\\". The National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) was the group consisting mainly of social activists, scholars, and Thaksin supporters who opposed the 2006 coup deposing Thaksin Shinawatra. It believed that the coup was supported by powerful persons, the \\"elites\\" or \\"nobles\\", targeting Prem Tinsulanonda, head of the privy council. The UDD aimed to topple the amatayathipatai (government run by traditional elites, nobles, and the bureaucratic polity). In the April 2009 protest, its aims were the immediate resignation of the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and members of the privy council, Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont, as well as new elections. It also demanded that charges be brought against PAD for the 2008 airport seizures and unrest. Several members of parliament in the Pheu Thai Party were vocal in their support of UDD, as well as of Thaksin Shinawatra himself. Origins of the crisis The 2008 crisis had its roots in the 2005‚Äì2006 Thai political crisis, the 2005 election and 2006 elections, the 2006 coup, and the 2007 general election. Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai party (TRT) won a landslide victory in the 2001 election, the first elections held under the Thai Constitution of 1997. Thaksin's grassroots economic policies helped reduce poverty and provided universal health care, making him hugely popular in rural Thailand. His drug policies were effective at reducing drug use but were attacked for the large number of extrajudicial executions that resulted. He was accused of conflicts of interest due to his family's continued holdings in Shin Corporation, the telecoms business that he founded prior to becoming Premier. Despite this, he became the first politician in Thai history to finish his term. Thaksin's re-election in 2005 election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history.Pongsudhirak Thitinan, \\"Victory places Thaksin at crossroads\\", Bangkok Post, 9 February 2005Aurel Croissant and Daniel J. Pojar, Jr., Quo Vadis Thailand? Thai Politics after the 2005 Parliamentary Election , Strategic Insights, Volume IV, Issue 6 (June 2005) Media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul had been a staunch supporter of Thaksin until major losses at state-owned Krung Thai Bank caused CEO Viroj Nualkhair to be fired. Viroj was Sondhi's former banker and had forgiven Sondhi for billions in bad personal debts. Sondhi's levied public criticisms of Thaksin on his TV show and his media outlets, the Manager Daily newspaper and ASTV. Sondhi's People's Alliance for Democracy soon gathered supporters among Dhammayuttika Nikaya disciples of Luang Ta Maha Bua, prominent socialites and members of the Thai royal family who claimed that Thaksin frequently insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej, several state-enterprise unions who were against Thaksin's state- enterprise privatization plans, and various factions in the Royal Thai Army who claimed that Thaksin promoted only those who were loyal to him. The movement gained in popularity after Thaksin's family sold their share in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings while making use of a regulation that exempted individuals from paying capital gains tax. The PAD led protests demanding that Thaksin pay additional taxes, despite the SEC and the Revenue Department saying that no wrong had been done. The protests escalated. In February 2006, Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratglin started secretly planning for a military coup, despite regular denials.The Nation, The persistent myth of the 'good' coup, 2 October 2006‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏à, ‡∏û‡∏•.‡∏ó.‡∏™‡∏û‡∏£‡∏±‡πà‡∏á ‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ì‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£\\"‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ú‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏π‡∏õ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏°‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß 7‚Äì8 ‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô\\", 24 September 2006Thanapol Eawsakul, \\"The Coup for Democracy with the King as Head of State\\", Fa Dieo Kan special issue, 2007 On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must obey the orders of the King ‚Äì not the Government. The coup was executed on 19 September 2006 while Thaksin was attending a UN summit, just weeks before a planned Parliamentary election.

The PAD voluntarily dissolved after announcing that its goals had been accomplished.People's Daily, Anti-Thaksin alliance dissolved, 21 September 2006 Surayud Chulanont, Prem's former close aide, was appointed Prime Minister.

Elections were scheduled for December 2007. Many TRT politicians moved to the People's Power Party. The PPP won the December elections and nominated Samak Sundaravej as Premier. 2008 resumption of PAD protests A line of PAD demonstrators in Bangkok The Samak Sundaravej government, elected in the December 2007 general elections, came under pressure to resign since May 2008, when the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) reformed and staged regular street protests. They protested the government's proposals to amend the 2007 constitution, claiming that Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his government are acting as a proxy for former deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.Head, \\"Rifts behind Thailand's political crisis\\" The PAD also criticized the Samak government's decision to support the Cambodian government's application for the listing of the disputed Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site. Tensions rose between Thailand and Cambodia as the PAD called for Thai investors to withdraw from Cambodia, the closure of all 40 Thai-Cambodian border checkpoints, a ban on all flights from Thailand to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, the construction of a naval base at Koh Kut near the border, and the abolition of the committee which oversees demarcation of overlapping sea areas and the unilateral declaration of a Thai marine map.Prachatai, Sondhi Limthongkul‚Äôs solution to the Preah Vihear dispute , 2 August 2008 In late June, the opposition filed a no-confidence motion in parliament, which the government survived. The PAD proposed that the constitution be amended to reduce the proportion of elected members of Parliament. This would disenfranchise the rural population, which the PAD viewed as being insufficiently educated to vote for anti-Thaksin Shinawatra parties.

He had been hosting the shows for years prior to becoming Premier. Section 267 of the 2007 Constitution of Thailand forbids members of the Cabinet from being employees of any person; this was to prevent conflicts of interest. The court found that although Samak was a contractor to the show's producers, and did not fit the definition of the term \\"employee\\" as defined under the Civil and Commercial Code, the law on labour protection or the law on taxation, the spirit of the Constitution gave a broader definition to the term. It thus found Samak guilty of breaching the Constitution and terminated his Premiership. A session of the House of Representatives was held on 12 September to vote for a new prime minister. The People Power Party decided to renominate Samak as Premier (he had stopped hosting the TV shows earlier that year and thus was no longer an employee). The session was cut short because the House lacked a quorum. The nomination of a new Prime Minister was postponed until 17 September, where the PPP successfully nominated Deputy Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat as Premier. Reactions to court decision Karn Tienkaew, deputy leader of Samak's People Power Party, said the party planned to propose a parliamentary vote Wednesday on returning Samak to power: \\"Samak still has legitimacy. The party still hopes to vote him back unless he says no. Otherwise we have many other capable candidates.\\"AP, \\"Thai leader forced to resign over TV cooking show\\" On 10 September 2008, however, the PPP shied away from their earlier statement they would renominate Sundaravej and was apparently looking for an alternative candidate instead;BBC, \\"Thai coalition looks for new PM\\" the new PM was to be nominated on 12 September 2008.People's Daily Online, \\"Thai ruling coalition to submit PM nominee Friday\\" People Power Party's deputy spokesman Kuthep Suthin Klangsang, on 12 September 2008, announced that: \\"Samak has accepted his nomination for prime minister.

Samak is the leader of our party so he is the best choice.\\" Despite objections from its coalition partners, the PPP, in an urgent meeting, unanimously decided to renominate Samak Sundaravej. 5 coalition parties, namely Chart Thai, Neutral Democratic, Pracharaj, Puea Pandin and Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana, unanimously agreed to support the People Power party (PPP) to set up the new government and vote for the person who should be nominated as the new prime minister. Chart Thai deputy leader Somsak Prissananantakul and Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana leader Chettha Thanajaro said the next prime minister who will be nominated on Friday.

At the Government House, Sondhi Limthongkul, however, stated that demonstrations would continue. Clashes and the siege of Parliament Armed with batons, PAD forces surrounded Parliament and used razor wire barricades to prevent the legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies.

Yet demonstrators started the siege of police headquarters near the Government House. The demonstrators called for the counter-attack on police force, then new clash erupted, causing the death of a female protester and injury of several protesters. The PAD leaders called the demonstrators to return to the Government House and limit the protest only at their 'stronghold', at the House, avoid using violence. Then calm returned to Bangkok. Queen's appearance On 13 October 2008, Queen Sirikit presided over the funeral ceremony of Angkhana Radappanyawut, the PAD supporter who had been killed by police during the protests. The Queen was accompanied by her youngest daughter, Princess Chulabhorn, Army Chief Anupong Paochinda, Opposition Leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, and many high-ranked officials, but there were no signs of any police personnel.

Her Majesy told Angsana's parents that their daughter had sacrificed her life for the sake of the monarchy, and that she was a good person. Previously, the revered Queen had donated ‡∏ø1 million to cover the medical expenses of those injured on both sides in the clashes. The protesters tried to claim the financial donation as a gesture of support for them, though in reality it went to aid injured policemen as well.BBC News, \\"Thailand's queen mourns protester\\". The King also made a financial contribution to the dead woman's family.The Nation, \\"Queen attends slain protester's cremation\\". Since the Queen's appearance was without precedent in modern times, many academicians and media deemed them to be \\"unusual\\" and perhaps an \\"explicit royal backing to a five-month street campaign to oust the elected government\\". Historian David Streckfuss of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison noted that no Thai social activists slain in the previous decade had had royal attendance at their funerals, \\"so it is interesting to note that in this case‚Äîa conflict that is controversial and ongoing‚Äîthat a member of the royalty should apparently show support.\\"Yahoo! News, \\"Thai queen attends funeral for anti-government protester\\". Yet one could claim in support of the PAD that really was there was a small 'anti- monarchy' movement which supported Thaksin. This disturbed many monarchists. Sondhi Limthongkul, forefront leader of PAD, had claimed this since 2005, when he started criticizing Thaksin Shinawatra for his 'inappropriate' act defaming the monarchy when Thaksin held a religious ceremony at the royal temple of Wat Phra Kaeo. From then on, PAD has accused Thaksin's followers as being 'anti- monarchy'. The UDD's and Thaksin's harsh attack on Prem Tinsulanonda, head of royal Privy Council and close advisor of the king, has been seen as a contradiction of Thai tradition and a hidden attempt to make a regime change. Moreover, a leader of UDD, such Jakrapob Penkair has engaged in public criticism of the role of the monarchy, mostly, seen 'negatively'. Several UDD leaders were also charged and arrested and accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime under Thai criminal law. The PAD, therefore, has always claimed that it was defending the most revered institution according to the Constitutions, blasting UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra as anti-monarchist. The controversial issue of the monarchy has been then one of the fierce causes among these factions' supporters.

Somchai flew into Bangkok Don Mueang airport on the evening of 25 November 2008 before flying on to Chiang Mai.

If the parties were dissolved, executives of the parties could have their political rights stripped for five years. However, non-executive MPs of the parties have the right to change parties for a period of time after the court decision. 37 PPP executives were also MPs, although 8 had resigned, leaving only 14. If the PPP was to be dissolved, the number of MPs they have would fall from 233 to 219. Out of Chart Thai's 43 executives, 19 of them are MPs. No Matchima executives are MPs. Thus, if the Constitutional Court dissolved all three parties, the government coalition would reduce in size to 283 out of a total of 447 MPs in Parliament ‚Äì a majority is 224. The opposition Democrat Party has only 164 MPs. If all the non-PPP parties allied with the Democrats, they would have a total of 228 MPs ‚Äì only 4 MPs above a majority.Matichon, ‡∏ü‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏á!!‡∏õ‡∏ä‡∏õ.‡πÅ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏à‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏• ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πâ‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏• ‡∏£‡∏ò‡∏ô.‡∏™‡∏±‡πà‡∏á‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ö 3 ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏£‡∏Ñ ‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏™.‡∏™.‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏• ‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ö-‡πÇ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏û‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏Ç‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å , 1 December 2008 The site for the court decision was changed from the Constitutional Court to the Supreme Administrative Court after UDD supporters surrounded the Constitution Court.

Father Tolstoy inaugurated a small Catholic community of Russian origin and was responsible by its development and its faithfuls. Father Tolstoy died on February 4, 1938. Biography Born into an aristocratic family in Saint Petersburg, graduated from the Page Corps and served in the Sofia Regiment. Soon after he entered the Moscow Theological Academy, while studying read all the available writings of the Fathers of the Church in Russian and \\" Summa Theologica, \\" Aquinas in Latin. On one of the social events met the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov and the crypto-catholic Elizabeth Volkonskaya. Tolstoy was impressed by the penetration of Protestant views in the teaching of Orthodox theology. In 1890, ordained an Orthodox priest in the following year taking a trip to the Middle East to become familiar with the traditions and customs of the Middle Eastern Christians. After the return of the French abbot Vivian of Saint Louis Church in Moscow he introduced Tolstoy to Dominican Vincenzo Vannutelli, who after talking with Tolstoy told him that with his views, he can consider himself a Catholic, while staying in the home of the Russian Orthodox Church. Soon Father Nicholas journey around the world taking with him marching corporal and remembering in the cities of following local bishops. In Vienna Nicholas Tolstoy first visited the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and met with Metropolitan Sylvester Sembratovich. After returning to Moscow Tolstoy wrote his thesis on the Eucharist under the leadership of Alexey Lebedev. In 1893 graduated with honors from the Theological Academy, and in November 1894 formally joined the Catholic Church. Soon Moscow Metropolitan Sergius noted the Catholic view of Nicholas Tolstoy. Nicholas wrote account of their religious views, but the Metropolitan has not given a single stroke. On his Catholic views Nikolai Tolstoy spoke with John Sergiev. In the Synod also knew about the views of Nicholas, but no action taken. After the funeral of Emperor Alexander III, Tolstoy suddenly summoned to the reception and showed to Procurator of the Holy Synod Vladimir Karlovich Sabler the latest issue of the Catholic journal \\" Revue B√©n√©dictine\\", which was published by his private letters to Father Vanutelli.

Nicholas Tolstoy went to Rome, where he met with many of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, including Pope Leo XIII. During the service of the liturgy in Rome Nicholas prayed for the Pope and the Emperor Nicholas II. Soon, the Russian ambassador Alexander Isvolsky calls to ban Nicholas in the service and deliver it to the Russian authorities, however, the Pope refused to meet these requirements. After some time, the ambassador Isvolsky deciding that Nicholas resigned to his emigration, gave the Pope, that Russia will not pursue disqualifying him by the Synod of dignity of a priest. On April 22, 1895 Nikolai Tolstoy returned to Moscow. Russian Latins were unhappy with his return, and especially his service on the \\"schismatic\\" ceremony. Father Nicholas made a small house church and served the Russian liturgy with the commemoration of the Pope. He was often visited by a Russian priest and professor of theology.

He is well known in India as a yogi, dnyani and spiritual leader. He succeeded as President of the Divine Life Society in 1963, after the death of his predecessor, Sivananda Saraswati, who founded the Society.Biography of Swami Chidananda Saraswati Divine Life Society HQ website. Chidananda's birth name was Sridhar Rao. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Loyola College, Chennai. He took to a life of renunciation in 1936, and joined the Sivananda Ashram run by Sivananda Saraswati in Rishikesh in 1943. He was appointed General Secretary of the Divine Life Society in 1948. He was initiated into the Sannyas order by his guru, Sivananda, on Guru Purnima day, 10 July 1949. It was then that he received his monastic name \\"Chidananda\\", which means \\"one who is consciousness and bliss\\". He was elected President of the Divine Life Society in August 1963, upon the death of Sivananda. Chidananda Saraswati died on 28 August 2008, at 20:11 pm.  Early life  Sridhar Rao, (as Chidananda Saraswati was known before taking Sannyasa (embracing a life of renunciation), was born in Mangalore, to Sri Srinivasa Rao and Sarojini, on 24 September 1916, the second of five children and the eldest son. Sri Srinivasa Rao was a prosperous Zamindar, a rich landlord owning several villages, extensive lands and palatial buildings in South India. Sarojini was an ideal Indian mother, noted for her saintliness. At the age of eight, Sridhar Rao's life was influenced by Sri Anantayya, a friend of his grandfather, who used to relate to him stories from the epics, Ramayana and MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. Doing Tapas (austerities), becoming a Rishi (sage), and having a vision of the Lord became ideals which he cherished. His uncle, Krishna Rao, shielded him against the influences of the materialistic world around him, and sowed in him the seeds of the nivritti life (life of renunciation) which he joyously nurtured until, as later events proved, it blossomed into sainthood. His elementary education began at Mangalore. In 1932, he joined the Sir M.Ct. Muthiah Chettiar Higher Secondary School in Madras, where he distinguished himself as a brilliant student. His cheerful personality, exemplary conduct, and extraordinary traits earned for him a distinct place in the hearts of all teachers and students who came into his contact. In 1936, he was admitted to Loyola College, University of Madras, whose portals admit only the most brilliant of students. In 1938, he emerged with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The family was noted for its high code of conduct and this was infused into his life. Charity and service were the glorious ingrained virtues of the members of the family. These virtues found an embodiment in Sridhar Rao. He discovered ways and means of manifesting them. No one who sought his help was sent away without assistance. He gave freely to the needy. Service, especially of the sick, often brought out the fact that he had no idea of his own separate existence as an individual. It seemed as if his body clung loosely to his soul. Nor was all this service confined to human beings. Birds and animals claimed his attention as much as, if not more than, human beings. He understood their language of suffering. His service of a sick dog evoked the admiration of his Guru, Sivananda. He would raise his finger in grim admonition when he saw anyone practicing cruelty to dumb animals in his presence. Quite early in life, although born in a wealthy family, he shunned the pleasures of the world to devote himself to seclusion and contemplation. In the matter of study, it was the spiritual books which had the most appeal to him, more than college books. Even while he was at college, text-books had to take second place to spiritual books. The works of Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sivananda, took precedence over all others. He shared his knowledge with others, so much so that he virtually became the Guru of the household and the neighborhood, to whom he would talk of honesty, love, purity, service and devotion to God. He would exhort them to perform japa of Rama-Nama. While still in his twenties, he began initiating youngsters into this great Rama Taraka Mantra. He was an ardent admirer of Sri Ramakrishna Math at Madras and regularly participated in the Satsangs (association with the wise) there. The call of Swami Vivekananda to renounce resounded within his pure heart. He ever thirsted for the darshan (meeting/s) of Saints and Sadhus (renunciate) visiting the metropolis. In June 1936, he disappeared from home. After a vigorous search by his parents, he was found in the secluded Ashram of a holy sage some miles from the sacred mountain shrine Tirupati. He returned home after some persuasion. This temporary separation was but a preparation for the final parting from the world of attachments to family and friends. Initiation The final decision came in 1943. He was already in correspondence with Sivananda Saraswati. He obtained Sivananda's permission to join the Ashram. On arriving at the Ashram, he naturally took charge of the dispensary. He became the man with the healing hand. The growing reputation of his divine healing hand attracted a rush of patients to the Sivananda Charitable Dispensary. Very soon after joining the Ashram, he gave ample evidence of the brilliance of his intellect. He delivered lectures, wrote articles for magazines and gave spiritual instructions to the visitors. When the Yoga-Vedanta Forest University (now known as the Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy) was established in 1948, Sivananda paid him a fitting tribute by appointing him Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Raja Yoga. During his first year he inspired the students with his brilliant exposition of Maharishi Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. It was also in the first year of his stay at the Ashram that he wrote his magnum opus 'Light Fountain', an immortal biography of his Guru Sivananda. Sivananda once remarked: \\"Sivananda will pass away, but 'Light Fountain' will live\\". In addition to his multifarious activities and intense Sadhana, he founded, under the guidance of Sivananda, the Yoga Museum in 1947, in which the entire philosophy of Vedanta and all the processes of Yoga Sadhana are depicted in the form of pictures and illustrations. Towards the end of 1948, Sivananda nominated him as the General Secretary of The Divine Life Society. The great responsibility of the organization fell on his shoulders. From that very moment he spiritualized all his activities by his presence, counsel and wise leadership. He exhorted all to raise their consciousness to the level of the Divine. On Guru Purnima day, 10 July 1949, he was initiated into the holy order of Sannyasa by Sivananda. He now became known as Chidananda, a name which connotes : \\"one who is consciousness and bliss\\". In August 1963, after the Mahasamadhi of the Master, he was elected as President of the Divine Life Society. After election, he strove to hold aloft the banner of renunciation, dedicated service, love and spiritual idealism, not only within the set-up of the widespread organization of the Society, but in the hearts of countless seekers throughout the world, who were all too eager to seek his advice, help and guidance. Chidananda Saraswati has toured the length and breadth of India, Malaysia and South Africa to serve the devotees of the Society. Again in 1968, Chidananda undertook the Global Tour at the request of numerous disciples and devotees of Sivananda, and visited all countries of the world. Wherever he went, devotees received him cordially, and listened to him with rapt attention. In one of his innumerous meetings Swami Chidananda met Sri Sri Sitaramdas Omkarnathdev and declared him as Naam Avatara and said \\"Beloved Babaji is verily Naam Avatara. His entire life and personality is a radiant example and expression of Naam Bhakti and Naam Shakti. I bow down in silent reverence and love at his holy feet.\\" Chidananda Saraswati, right from the beginning worked and served the cause of Sivananda's mission tirelessly, and to spread his Divine Life message far and wide, not only in Bharatavarsha (India) but also in countries outside. He inspired others through the practice of self-discipline. For example, after completing a thirty-day fast while in Canada, Swami Chidananda arranged for resources to be provided to support the founding of a Sivanada Ashram in Vancouver. He practiced a non-denominational, universal form of yoga. He often led satsang (group chanting) that named and elevated all of the prophets and sages of all of the world religions equally (Lord Jesus, Ahura Mazda, Lord Buddha, etc.).

Its steep pitched roof and lancet windows are typical of Carpenter Gothic churches. St. Patrick's was served by noted missionary priest Fr. Albert Lacombe until his death in 1916. Because of its architecture, its connection with Fr. Lacombe and its significance in the religious development of southern Alberta, it was designated a Provincial Historic Resource on April 10, 2001.Canada's Historic Places listing for St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church The church is set back from the east side of Macleod Trail, and is located north of St. Paul's Anglican Church, a Registered Historic Resource built in 1885. On a hill directly east of the churches stands Lacombe Home, a Provincial Historic Resource built in 1910. St. Patrick's congregation moved to a new building in 1983. The original St. Patrick's church was later used by Midlands United Church, St. Paul's Anglican Church, and All Saints (Lutheran) Church - but was soon vacant and fell into disrepair. In 1997 the Diocese sold the land to Memorial Gardens Association (Alberta) Limited, and the entire property is registered as a cemetery. In late 2010 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calgary reacquired the land and in June 2011 permitted the St. John Chrysostom Russian Orthodox Church to begin rehabilitation of the church and use of it as a place of worship.

While studying at Aberystwyth, Peate won university prizes for his poetry and for his participation in the eisteddfod. Peate began his career by lecturing in rural Ceredigion and Meirioneth, before being appointed in 1927 to catalogue the National Museum of Wales' folk collections. Inspired by the open-air museums of Scandinavia, Peate had a vision of recreating this style of attraction for Welsh life and culture. His initial attempts were challenged by those outside and inside the academic world. The work on the museum commenced in 1946, thanks to the donation of land from the Earl of Plymouth. Peate published work on the study of folk life in both English and Welsh. He was a pacifist who registered as a conscientious objector in 1941 and believed in a monoglot Welsh-speaking Wales.

He was the band member until 1982 and released two singles and one EP with the band.  Biography  Jovanoviƒá has lived in Belgrade in the same apartment building where Vlada Divljan and Zdenko Kolar lived. The three made a deal to start playing. Divljan got a guitar, Kolar bought a bass and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá used a tin barrel as a drum with metal sticks made by Kolar's father. The band was called Faraoni (Pharaohs) since Divljan had a necklace from Egypt, given by his grandmother, with a Tutankhamun medallion. Since there was a popular band from Kopar named Faraoni, the band was renamed to Holipe. The band lasted for a short time. When Deƒçaci decided to start playing Divljan called Kolar and Jovanoviƒá to join the band. At the time the band was working with Dragan Papiƒá, photographer and journalist, who became the band's creative mediator and who published Deƒçaci photos in a well known youth magazine \\"Vidici\\". Since Kolar and Jovanoviƒá wore beards the band was called Deƒçaci plus Bradonje (The Boys plus The Bearded) and was shortly after renamed to Idoli. The band had a rehearsal on March 1, 1980 which was chosen to be the foundation date of the band. On the first rehearsals Idoli wrote their notable hits, first \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" and \\"Pomoƒá, pomoƒá\\" and then \\"Maljƒçiki\\", \\"Malena\\", \\"Plastika\\" and other notable new wave anthems. A month later Papiƒá made a deal with \\"Vidici\\" to finance the recording of the first single so the band members recorded \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" and \\"Pomoƒá, pomoƒá\\" as their first single given as present with the April release of the magazine \\"Vidici\\". In the meantime Papiƒá made Kolar and Jovanoviƒá to shave, but since the two were not as photogenic as the other three members, Papiƒá stopped working with the band. The band started performing live, but due to a small repertoire, the appearances lasted for about ten to twenty minutes. In an interview Kolar stated that Jovanoviƒá was a man with the best rhythm feeling he had ever played with, but on live appearances he was always tense but managed to do the work. Since Idoli became well known and Jugoton was asking for new bands of the popular new wave music, Idoli were offered to record a single with produce Goran Bregoviƒá. \\"Maljƒçiki\\" and a new version of \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" became hits on radio stations. The band members also participated the Paket aran≈æman project which made them become one of the most popular acts in Yugoslavia. Jovanoviƒá did not appear on the \\"Maljƒçiki\\" video but appeared on other videos of that period. When the band set for the studio to record the first album, the eyes of the public were set right at them. Photographs from the recording sessions came out in the newspapers and the release was expected to come out. The band managed to record six new tracks which were released on a 12\\" EP called VIS Idoli. It featured two covers and four Idoli tracks. The EP was sold in 200.000 copies. After the release of the EP Jovanoviƒá left Idoli and his later career and life are unknown.

Vision disorder is not the same as an eye disease. Although many vision disorders do have their immediate cause in the eye, there are many other causes that may occur at other locations in the optic pathway.  Causes  There are many eye conditions that can lead to vision disorder. Some of which are as follows: *Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD): ARMD is a retinal degeneration disease specifically associated with macula blood vessels, which can result in central vision impairment. It is strongly linked to advancing age, as well as European ancestry. *Bulging eyes: where the eye (one or both) protrudes or distends out of its orbit. Left untreated, bulging eyes may lead to eye dryness, pain and vision loss *Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis: This is an inflammation of the retina caused by infection, which can result in blindness. It occurs in people experiencing suppressed immune systems, most commonly by Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME): is an eye disease specifically related to diabetes, occurring due to fluid build- up in the retina as a result of sustained high blood glucose levels. It can result in blurred vision and vision loss. * Eye floaters and spots: where visible cloud-like images appear to \\"float\\" in an individual's field of vision . Floaters and spots are most commonly related to ageing. They are generally harmless and do not cause blindness * Eye flashing: characterised by bursts or streaks of light that appear in an individual's field of vision. As eye flashing may indicate impending retinal detachment, medical attention is required . * Eyelid twitching: where the eye lid muscles contract in an irregular or abnormal pattern. Such movements can cause irritation and fatigue to the eyes . *Glaucoma: occurs when the optic nerve is damaged and can result in irreversible vision loss, with the potential to pass undetected until this damage occurs. It is caused when aqueous humour fails to adequately drain from the eye, resulting in pressure build-up. *Keratoconus: vision problems can be caused when the cornea thins and distorts into a conical shape. While the cause is unknown, Keratoconus is believed to be congenital, and can be exacerbated by allergies and eye rubbing. * Uveitis: where the uveal (middle) layer of the eye is inflamed. Uveitis requires medical intervention as it can lead to blurry vision, eye pain, eye floaters, eye redness and vision loss  Epidemiology  It was estimated by the WHO in 2004 that 314 million people worldwide are vision impaired (from all causes), of whom 45 million are blind. Vision disorders are not often targeted by public health initiatives, as mortality causes take priority. However, they can have significant impact on a person's quality of life, affecting performance at school and the workplace if not corrected.

The species are evergreen or deciduous trees, shrubs, and climbers from tropics to temperate zones worldwide. The type species is Ilex aquifolium, the common European holly used in Christmas decorations and cards. Description Ilex paraguariensis The genus Ilex includes about 480 species, divided into three subgenera: * Ilex subg. Byronia, with the type species Ilex polypyrena * Ilex subg. Prinos, with 12 species * Ilex subg. Ilex, with the rest of the species The genus is widespread throughout the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the Tertiary period and many species are adapted to laurel forest habitats. It occurs from sea level to more than with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, evergreen trees with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent branchlets. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to tall. The type species is the European holly Ilex aquifolium described by Linnaeus. Plants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, frequently with a spiny leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants. The small fruits of Ilex, although often referred to as berries, are technically drupes. They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The \\"bones\\" contain up to ten seeds each. Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves. Hence the cut branches, especially of I. aquifolium, are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans, and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds. Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well. Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, English holly (Ilex aquifolium), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species. It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/34460?a=322280 Etymology Ilex in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak (Quercus ilex). Despite the Linnaean classification of Ilex as holly, as late as the 19th century in Britain, the term Ilex was still being applied to the oak as well as the holly ‚Äì possibly due to the superficial similarity of the leaves. The name \\"holly\\" in common speech refers to Ilex aquifolium, specifically stems with berries used in Christmas decoration. By extension, \\"holly\\" is also applied to the whole genus. The origin of the word \\"holly\\" is considered a reduced form of Old English ',Middle English Holin, later Hollen. Middle English Holin, later Hollen.T. F. Hoad, English Etymology, Oxford University Press, 1993 (), p. 218b. The French word for holly, ', derives from the Old Low Franconian *hulis (Middle Dutch huls). Both are related to Old High German ', huls, as are Low German/Low Franconian terms like ' or '. These Germanic words appear to be related to words for holly in Celtic languages, such as Welsh ', Breton ' and Irish '. Several Romance languages use the Latin word acrifolium, literally \\"sharp leaf\\" (turned into aquifolium in modern time), so Italian ', Occitan ', etc. History Hollies (here, Ilex aquifolium) are dioecious: (above) shoot with flowers from male plant; (top right) male flower enlarged from female plant; (lower right) female flower enlarged, showing stamen and reduced, sterile stamens with no pollen. The phylogeography of this group provides examples of various speciation mechanisms at work. In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining Ilex when the Earth mass broke away into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called allopatric speciation. Over time, survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to reproductive isolation, an example of ecological speciation. In the Pliocene, around five million years ago, mountain formation diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus. The fossil record indicates that the Ilex lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the Cretaceous period. Based on the molecular clock, the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the Eocene, about 50million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches. The laurel forest covered great areas of the Earth during the Paleogene, when the genus was more prosperous. This type of forest extended during the Neogene, more than 20million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate broadleaf evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene. Many of the then-existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species relict in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence. Range The genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the tropics and subtropics, with a worldwide distribution in temperate zones. The greatest diversity of species is found in the Americas and in Southeast Asia. Ilex mucronata, formerly the type species of Nemopanthus, is native to eastern North America. Nemopanthus was treated as a separate genus with eight species.Species PPP-index of the family Aquifoliaceae, now transferred to Ilex on molecular data;Powell, M., Savolainen, V., Cu√©nod, P., Manen, J. F., & Andrews, S. (2000). The mountain holly (Nemopanthus mucronatus: Aquifoliaceae) revisited with molecular data. Kew Bulletin 55: 341‚Äì347. it is closely related to Ilex amelanchier. In Europe the genus is represented by a single species, the classically named holly Ilex aquifolium, and in continental Africa by this species and Ilex mitis. Ilex canariensis, from Macaronesia, and Ilex aquifolium arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has Ilex arnhemensis. Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are endemic. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil is Ilex paraguariensis or Yerba mate. Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare. Ecology Often the tropical species are especially threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation. At least two species of Ilex have become extinct recently, and many others are barely surviving.International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (2007): 2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Ilex] They are extremely important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the double-striped pug moth (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella, which feeds exclusively on hollies, and the engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia). Toxicity Holly can contain caffeic acid, caffeoyl derivatives, caffeoylshikimic acid, chlorogenic acid, feruloylquinic acid, quercetin, quinic acid, kaempferol, tannins, rutin, caffeine, and theobromine. Holly berries can cause vomiting and diarrhea. They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries. Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children. Holly leaves, if eaten, might cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal problems. Holly plants might be toxic to pets and livestock.  Uses  Culinary use Leaves of some holly species are used by some cultures to make daily tea. These species are Yerba mate (I. paraguariensis), Ilex guayusa, Kuding (Ilex kaushue), Yaupon (I. vomitoria) and others. Leaves of other species, such as gallberry (I. glabra) are bitter and emetic. In general little is known about inter-species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies. Ornamental use Many of the holly species are widely used as ornamental plants in temperate/European gardens and parks, notably: * I. aquifolium (common European holly) * I. crenata (box-leaved holly) * I. verticillata (winterberry) Moreover, many hundreds of hybrids and cultivars have been developed for garden use, among them the very popular \\"Highclere holly\\", Ilex √ó altaclerensis (I. aquifolium √ó I. perado) and the \\"blue holly\\", Ilex √ó meserveae (I. aquifolium √ó I. rugosa).Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . The cultivars I. √ó meserveae = ‚ÄòConablu‚Äô and = 'Conapri' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Hollies are often used for hedges; the spiny leaves make them difficult to penetrate, and they take well to pruning and shaping.Northumbria Police: Security starts at the Garden Gate Culture Traditional Christmas card with holly and mistletoe. Circa 1880s Holly ‚Äì more specifically the European holly, Ilex aquifolium ‚Äì is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn. In many Western Christian cultures, holly is a traditional Christmas decoration, used especially in wreaths and illustrations, for instance on Christmas cards. Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism, as expressed in the traditional Christmas carol \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\", in which the holly represents Jesus and the ivy represents the Virgin Mary. Angie Mostellar discusses the Christian use of holly at Christmas, stating that: In heraldry, holly is used to symbolize truth. The Norwegian municipality of Stord has a yellow twig of holly in its Coat-of-arms.

The name is relatively new, and encompasses what had formerly been the Seton Portage River or Portage Creek (aka Portage River) and Seton Creek (which shows up on some topos as \\"Section Creek\\" due to a mis-read of old hand-written maps). Course The Seton River originates at the foot of Anderson Lake and runs initially for only 3 km to the head of Seton Lake. From the foot of Seton Lake to the Fraser its remaining course is 5 km in length, with much of its flow diverted via the Seton Canal to the Seton Powerhouse (also known because of its location as the Lillooet Powerhouse). The river's course is generally eastward to join the Fraser River at the town of Lillooet. The upper section between the lakes was historically known as the Portage River or Seton Portage River; its flow is augmented by Whitecap Creek, from the northwest midway along its length, and by Spider Creek nearer Seton Lake. The lower section was formerly named Seton Creek and commonly mislabelled on some maps as \\"Section Creek\\", apparently a misrendering of the archaic spelling Seaton Creek. Just below the foot of Seton Lake its flow is considerably augmented by the addition of the waters of Cayoosh Creek, a name which originally applied all the way to the Fraser until the name \\"Seton River\\" was coined by the Canadian Geographic Names Board in 1950.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Cayoosh Creek\\" \\"Cayoosh Creek\\" is still generally applied to the river below that point by local residents, often with the spelling \\"Cayoose Creek\\", which is also the old name of the Sekw‚Äôel‚Äôw√°s First Nation (i.e. \\"Cayoose Creek Indian Band\\"). Above Anderson Lake, the main watercourse of the Seton drainage is named the Gates River; numerous creeks along Anderson lake contribute substantially to the volume supplied by the Gates; these include McGillivray Creek, Haylmore Creek, and Lost Valley Creek.

He is presumed to be the founder of St Tanwg's Church, the small church at Llandanwg near Harlech, although the presence of an inscribed stone which has been dated to the 5th century suggests the church was already in existence when Tanwg and his brothers arrived in the area early in the 6th century. This Llandanwg Stone is inscribed with two names, one being Ingenui (meaning 'of Ingenuus'); the other is indecipherable. The stone is not local. It is thought to have come from the Wicklow Hills in Ireland. This means that it was probably brought over by a rich person. It is a reasonable conjecture that Ingenuus may have been the founder of the church in the late fifth century, and that St. Tanwg lived at this llan a generation or two later. Another stone, called the Equester Stone, is of 6th century date. It is inscribed Equestrinomine, an unusual form of wording otherwise known only from 4th century inscriptions in Italy and Gaul.Bowen, E.G. Saints, Seaways and Settlements. 1969.

Saint Tanwg is said to have been the son of Ithel the Generous of Armorica and the cousin of St Cadfan.The Cambrian Quarterly Magazine and Celtic Repository, volume 2 (1830), p. 11. According to Enwogion Cymru, he was 'a saint who lived in the early part of the sixth century. He was one of the sons of Ithel Hael and he accompanied St Cadfan from Armorica to Britain. ( Enwogion says this was in the time of Vortigern \\"who procured wise men and divines from Gaul, now called France, to renovate Christianity in this Island, in consequence of the decay and failure that had befallen the faith in Christ\\" but this is impossible as Vortigern ruled from c425 to c474. Besides, he is not known to have favoured Christianity.) St Cadfan reportedly was one of the founders of the college of Bardsey as a monastery in 516 AD and to have been Abbot there until 542. He was the brother of Sts. Baglan, Trillo, Tegai, Twrog, Tecwyn, Gredifael, Flewyn and Llechid, and is commemorated 10 October.Enwogion Cymru: A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Welshmen, from the Earliest Times to the Present, and Including Every Name Connected with the Ancient History of Wales By Robert Williams, Llandovery, 1852.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean‚Äîthe Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45¬∞E and 100¬∞E are included in the season by the IMD. Systems Tropical Storm One (1B) Tropical Storm One, which developed in the central Bay of Bengal on May 22, strengthened to a peak of 70 mph winds before hitting Bangladesh on the 25th. The storm brought torrential rains and flooding, killing around 11,069 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Advance warning likely cut back on what could have been a much higher death toll. Tropical Storm Two (2A) A tropical depression formed in the central Arabian Sea on May 28. It headed northward, reaching a peak of 60 mph winds before hitting western India on the 31st. The storm dissipated on the 1st. Tropical Storm Three (3B) Tropical Storm Three, which developed in the central Bay of Bengal, moved northwestward to hit India on the 11th as a 60 mph storm. Tropical Storm Four (4B) Tropical Cyclone 04B had a long life.

Biography The 1850 United States Federal Census shows that Fry was living with his family in Shelby County, Kentucky. Fry received his early education in Lexington, Kentucky. Fry at the age of sixteen years found employment as a shipping clerk in the glass manufacturing industry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1860, Fry met Abraham Lincoln while on a sales business trip. It is not known if they discussed the topic of glass. In 1862, Fry enlisted in the 15th regiment of the Pennsylvania cavalry. He was in the army until the end of the American Civil War. He then obtained gainful employment at a glass company called Fry, Semple, and Reynolds. Fry with others in 1872 formed Rochester Tumbler Company, a glass manufacturing facility. Here in Rochester they built extensive plant building structures on of land they purchased. The company manufactured pressed and blown glass tumblers, being the largest such manufacturer in the nation. They sold these tumblers worldwide. The Rochester Tumbler Company employed over 1200 employees. All the equipment needed in glass production they made themselves on the premises. H. C. Fry Glass Factory, c. 1910 In 1897 Rochester Tumbler Company joined National Glass Company of Rochester. Fry became the president of the newly formed corporation. In 1900 he resigned and formed his own company in 1901 called Rochester Glass Company with his sons Harry and J. Howard. In 1902 the company was renamed to H. C. Fry Glass Company. With an investment of $500,000, Fry developed and manufactured a new fine cut glass process using pressed blank hot glass techniques. He patented this invention. The glass was pressed into a mold where previously the technique of cut glass had only been blown by hand.Kane, p. 211 The glass was pressed into a mold, the marks of the iron plunger remaining on the inside of the glass. Previously, cut glass had been blown by hand. The iron plunger pushed into the mold of hot glass and its marks remained on the inside of the glass producing the cut glass effect. The H. C. Fry Glass Company made complete dinner sets and tea sets. The company also made a large variety of heat-resistant oven glassware from 1916 under a license from the Corning Glass Works. They also made electrical glass insulators, however few were sold and they are a very rare collector's item. They employed about 1000 people. The plant operated into the 1930s until closure by the receivers. There is a H. C. Fry Glass Society for the study and preservation of glass made at the H. C. Fry Glass Company.

Churchtown Farm is a community nature reserve one mile south of Saltash, Cornwall, England. It is owned and managed by Cornwall Wildlife Trust, and includes diverse habitats such as grassland, estuarine mudflats, wetland, woodland, disused quarries and hedgerows.Wildlife Britain - Think Books Situated within the Tamar Valley AONB, and positioned between the rivers Tamar and Lynher as well as Forder Creek, the majority of the reserve is farmland. This includes hay meadows and arable fields. At 61 hectares, it is the third biggest reserve that the Cornwall Wildlife Trust owns. The land on the reserve is being farmed in a way which reflects traditional Cornish farming, benefiting wildlife in many ways. Historically, Churchtown Farm was farmed for dairy and arable production. From the 1960s, most of the fields were intensively managed, being re-seeded with highly productive rye grass mixtures maintained by regular applications of chemical fertilisers and heavy grazing. This intensive management has artificially increased the soil nutrients and encouraged pastures with a very limited range of plant species and little structural variation. In such a field there is little insect, animal or bird life. In an attempt to encourage wildlife back to the farm, Cornwall Wildlife Trust are using a number of less intensive management techniques aimed at reducing the soil nutrient levels and increasing the number of plant species. Forder Creek The two disused quarries in the reserve, Forder and Lowhill, were quarried in the 19th century for roadstone. Lowhill closed in 1915. Horneblende dolerite was quarried for use in road construction. Both quarries are now County Geological Sites. Oystercatchers, Dunlins, Egrets, Avocets and Greenshank can all be seen on the mudflats.

Since 2006 methylhexanamine has been sold extensively under many names as a stimulant or energy-boosting dietary supplement under the claim that it is similar to certain compounds found in geraniums, but its safety has been questioned as a number of adverse events and at least five deaths have been associated with methylhexanamine-containing supplements. It is banned by many sports authorities and governmental agencies. Despite multiple warning letters from the FDA, as of 2019, the stimulant remains available in sports and weight loss supplements.

Report of the Department Of Defense: 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (Dmaa) Safety Review Panel June 3, 2013 The compound is an aliphatic amine; the pharmaceutical industry had a strong interest in compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to methylhexanamine and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: tuaminoheptane, octin, oenethyl (2-methylaminoheptane), and propylhexedrine; octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under anesthesia.

A large number of supplements focusing on fat loss and workout energy (thermogenic or general-purpose stimulants) used the ingredient in concert with other substances such as caffeine, a combination similar to the combination of ephedrine and caffeine. Methylhexanamine- containing supplements sometimes list \\"geranium oil\\" or \\"geranium extract\\" as a source of methylhexanamine. However, geranium oils do not contain methylhexanamine, and the methylhexanamine in these supplements is added in the form of synthetic material. A variety of studies have explored the possibility that DMAA is found in some types of geraniums, but at present, high quality evidence of DMAA's presence in plants is lacking. Methylhexanamine is synthesized by reacting 4-methylhexan-2-one with hydroxylamine, which converts the 4-methylhexan-2-one to 4-methylhexan-2-one oxime, which is reduced with hydrogen by means of a catalyst; the resulting methylhexanamine can be purified by distillation.\\"Methylhexaneamine Carbonate\\" entry in Marshall Sittig. Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, Second Edition, Reprint Edition, Volume 1-2. 1988 Noyes Publications. Westwood, New Jersey. Pharmacology Methylhexanamine is an indirect sympathomimetic drug that constricts blood vessels and thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes bronchodilation, inhibits peristalsis in the intestines, and has diuretic effects. Most studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; the understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds. A 2013 review concluded that: \\"Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4‚Äì15 mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50‚Äì75 mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100 mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24‚Äì36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up).\\"  Detection in body fluids Methylhexanamine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma methylhexanamine concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10‚Äì100 Œºg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 Œºg/l in intoxicated patients, and >300 Œºg/l in victims of acute overdosage. Safety The for methylhexanamine is 39 mg/kg in mice and 72.5 mg/kg in rats, when administered intravenously. The FDA has stated that methylhexanamine \\"is known to narrow the blood vessels and arteries, which can elevate blood pressure and may lead to cardiovascular events ranging from shortness of breath and tightening in the chest to heart attack\\". Numerous adverse events and at least five deaths have been reported in association with methylhexanamine-containing dietary supplements. A 2012 review by a panel convened by the U.S. Department of Defense to study whether the military should ban methylhexanamine supplements from stores on its bases concluded that: \\"The existing evidence does not conclusively establish that DMAA-containing substances are causally-associated with adverse medical events. However, a consistent theme among the studies is that DMAA use potentially affects cardiovascular function, just as other sympathomimetic stimulants. Without further rigorous study designs developed to evaluate the safety of DMAA, especially in patients with concomitant use of other substances, co-morbid conditions and high frequency use, the magnitude of the association of DMAA with adverse medical events is uncertain. Widespread use of DMAA-containing products by tens of thousands of Service members ‚Äì often in combination with other substances ‚Äì increases the likelihood of observing serious adverse events, even if the overall risk of a DMAA-related event is low, resulting in consequential impact to some Service members and other beneficiaries. DMAA should be further studied to evaluate its safety. Data from the case control study suggest that the frequency and amount of DMAA use and risk of specific [acquired medical events], particularly heat injuries and rhabdomyolysis, need to be examined in greater detail. ... The Safety Review Panel recommended ... to continue the prohibition of sales of DMAA-containing products in Exchanges and concessions. The Panel judged that the evidence supports sufficient risk, even if very low, of another death or catastrophic illness of a Service member who has used DMAA-containing products, without any offsetting benefit of these products.\\" Deaths and injuries In 2010, a 21-year-old male in New Zealand presented with a cerebral hemorrhage after ingesting 556 mg of methylhexanamine, caffeine, and alcohol. Health authorities in Hawaii linked cases of liver failure and one death to OxyElite Pro, a weight loss and bodybuilding dietary supplement. The death of Claire Squires, a runner who collapsed near the finish-line of the April 2012 London Marathon, has been linked to methylhexanamine. The coroner stated that methylhexanamine was \\"probably an important factor\\" during the inquest. Despite, according to a friend, having been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat  and advised not to consume methylhexanamine, it is believed that she consumed the substance through drinking an energy drink, which was subsequently reformulated to exclude methylhexanamine. Regulation A number of sporting authorities and countries have banned or heavily restricted the use of methylhexanamine as a dietary supplement, due to serious concerns about its safety. These countries include the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Sports authorities Many professional and amateur sports bodies, such as the World Anti Doping Agency, have banned methylhexanamine as a performance-enhancing substance and suspended athletes that have used it.WADA 2010 Prohibited List (pdf) , World Anti-Doping Agency, Monday, 19 September 2009 *March, 2012, a minor league baseball player, Cody Stanley, was suspended 50 games for testing positive after using a dietary supplement. *In July 2012, Welsh boxer Enzo Maccarinelli was banned for six months after testing positive for methylhexanamine. *VFL player Matthew Clark was suspended for two years after the banned substance was detected in his system after a game in 2011. *August, 2012, minor league baseball player Marcus Stroman was suspended 50 games for testing positive for methylhexanamine. *On 8 August 2013, US Weightlifter Brian Wilhelm accepted a nine-month suspension after testing positive for the drug in a urine sample from December 2012 at the American Open.US Weightlifting Athlete, Wilhelm, Accepts Sanction For Anti-Doping Rule Violation http://www.usada.org/media/sanction-wilhelm8813 (2013-08-8) *MotoGP rider Anthony West was suspended for one month by the FIM International Disciplinary Court (CDI) on 29 October 2012 after testing positive for the drug on 20 May 2012 at the French Grand Prix.

Army Times. Retrieved on 2012-04-12. In July 2011, Health Canada decided methylhexanamine was not a dietary substance, but was a drug requiring further approval. Consequently, Health Canada banned all sales of methylhexanamine. In June 2012, the National Food Agency of Sweden issued a general warning regarding use of methylhexanamine products, resulting in a sales ban in parts of the country. In July 2012, the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil issued a warning to the general public on the hazards of products that contain methylhexanamine. It also updated the list of prohibited substances to insert methylhexanamine, which translates into the banishment of products containing such ingredient from the Brazilian market. In 2012, Australia banned methylhexanamine. In New South Wales, methylhexanamine was classed as a \\"highly dangerous substance\\" on the poisons list. In August 2012, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has ruled that the popular DMAA containing sports supplement Jack3D is an unlicensed medicinal product and that it and all other methylhexanamine containing products need to be removed from the UK market amid concerns of potential risks to public safety.

The no charge swim has achieved a cult status amongst open water swimmers and triathletes. Thousands have completed the swim. It is originally known as the Aquatica (unrelated to the Orlando water park) 1K enter the food chain swim. The swim is listed by the World Open Water Swimming Association as one of the top 100 open water swims in America. History The swim began in 1989 when Lucky Meisenheimer invited friends and masters swimmers he coached at the YMCA Aquatic Center to join him on his morning lake swim.. Initially the swim was held on Saturdays but after the first year went to 4 days a week. In 1995, it became a daily swim except for Sundays. Originally, the swim went from April through October, in 2005 the swim went year round. The weekday swims, which are always at 6:30 AM, are started in the dark much of the year. On Saturdays and holidays the swims are at 7:45 AM. The starts are a mass start and no other start times are available. In 2013 timed records began to be recorded for all age groups. The current fastest crossing is 12 mins 58 secs by John Meisenheimer, VII. 9 The Wall of Fame In 1999, swimmers began signing their names to a wall on the back of the Meisenhiemer's house on the first completion of the 1-kilometer course. Lucky would write one item of sporting accomplishment under the name if one existed. There is now an eclectic mix of accomplishments listed on the wall some that include; Olympic Swimmers, Olympic Water Polo, National Swimming Champions from multiple countries, World Record holders, National Parachuting Champion, Hang Gliding world record holder, National Sailing Champion, National Unicycle Champion, and scores of Ironman distance finishers. In 2004, Disney artist Ron McDonald added a swimming mural to the wall. In 2008, the wall had to be expanded to allow for more names. Risks The swim is done at a person's own risk. There are no lifeguards or rescue boats. Participants are expected to be accomplished swimmers: others are told not to swim. Swimmers are encouraged to use a flotation aid such as a pull buoy or wetsuit. Alligators have been seen in the lake at times and some swimmers do swim with knives, but there has never been an alligator attack. Reportedly, a lake cane monster lives in the lake. Although, never photographed, residents and swimmers have reported sightings or feeling the monster brush up against them. All new swimmers to the lake for their first 3 crossings must have flotation with them, no exceptions. This could be in the form of a pull buoy, lifeguard buoy, wetsuit, etc. Rewards On completion of a swimmer's first swim, they receive a patch with the logo of the swim, a bumper sticker, and get to sign the wall of fame. On the twenty-fifth crossing swimmers receive a white racing cap with the logo. On the one hundredth crossing, swimmers are inducted into the 100K club, their name is highlighted in yellow on the wall of fame, and they receive a baseball cap with the logo. At 150 crossings, swimmers receive a yellow racing cap, 200 crossings a T-shirt, 500 crossings a silver racing cap, and 1000 crossing a gold racing cap and medallion. Statistics *Lake Cane is an spring fed lake with an average depth of approximately . The water temperature ranges from 53 F to 90 F. *Swimmers from over 40 different countries have completed the swim. *In 2007, a RHR world record was set by a 50-person relay doing 100 crossings. *The youngest to complete the swim is Jake Meisenheimer at age 6 and the oldest first time swimmer is Brud Cleaveland Age 92. *The heaviest person to complete the swim is Joe Mattern, at age 51, weighing 480 lbs., on December 5, 2016. Joe was awarded his white swimming cap by Lucky Meisenheimer on March 15, 2017.

It was developed by Layman Allen a former professor of Yale Law School and the University of Michigan. Rules In the game, players must be able to recognize a \\"well-formed formula\\" (WFF) in ≈Åukasiewicz notation, and to and use rules of logic to manipulate those WFFs into a proof. Games are played in groups of two or three. The first player rolls the cubes and sets a WFF as a Goal. The goal is the conclusion of a proof. Each player then tries to construct a proof that ends with the goal. The Solution to the goal is the Premises which they started their proof with, and the Rules they used to get to the Goal. Players take turns moving to the Essentials, Permitted Premises, or Permitted Rules sections of the mat. Any cube moved to Essentials must be used in any Solution, and must be an essential part of that solution; any cube in Permitted Premises may be used as part of a premise; any cube in Permitted Rules may be used as part of a Rule. Thus the players themselves shape the Solution, forcing one another to create new Solutions in response to moves. At any point a player may challenge the last mover, if they feel the last mover has made a mistake. There are three types of Challenges. A-Flub means that the Challenger can make a Solution using the cubes in Required and Permitted and one more cube from Resources. P-Flub, or Challenge Impossible means the player believes the Mover cannot make a Solution using the cubes in Required, Permitted, and Resources. C-A-Flub means that the Challenger believes that the Mover, or some previous mover, missed an A-Flub. After a challenge, at least one player must show a correct Solution on paper. The scoring goes like this: > The player who wins the challenge scores 10 points. > The loser of the challenge scores 6. > If there is a third player, he must side with or against the Challenger and > scores points depending upon that decision.

Five candidates were on the ballot, seeking election to a five-year term. The election featured the unprecedented use of television, posters, and other media by multiple candidates to communicate platforms and solicit votes. The candidates included APF leader Abulfaz Elchibey, former parliament speaker Yaqub Mamedov, Movement for Democratic Reforms leader and Minister of Justice Ilyas Ismayilov, National Democratic Group leader Rafig Abdullayev, and Union of Democratic Intelligentsia candidate Nizami Suleymanov. Two other candidates, from the NIP and the APF, withdrew from the race during the campaign. To register, each candidate had to collect at least 20,000 signatures and present them to the Central Electoral Commission. Aliyev was unable to run because of a constitutional provision barring candidates over sixty-five years of age. The government agreed to allow international observers to monitor the election. Etibar Mammadov, Elchibey's main rival in the polls, dropped out of the race a few days before the election, calling for rule by a coalition government and the postponement of balloting until Azerbaijan's state of war with Armenia ended. Elchibey's election as president signaled a break in communist party dominance of Azerbaijani politics. He received 60.9% of more than three million votes cast. The runner-up, Suleimanov, made a surprise showing of 34% of the vote by promising Azerbaijanis instant wealth and victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. No other candidate garnered as much as five per cent of the vote. Elchibey had been a student of Arabic philology, a translator, and a college instructor. In 1975 the KGB imprisoned him for two years for anti-Soviet activities. In a postelection address to the nation, he announced a stabilization phase based on the transfer of power to his democratic faction. When that phase ended in 1993, constitutional, economic, and cultural reforms would be implemented, according to this plan. His top domestic policy priorities, creation of a national army and a national currency backed by gold reserves, were seen as necessary elements for national sovereignty. Despite the new president's intentions, the war in Nagorno-Karabakh dominated politics, and Elchibey and his party steadily lost influence and popular appeal because of continual military losses, a worsening economy, political stalemate, and government corruption.

In January 1874, the Southern Pacific Railroad completed a rail line from Los Angeles to Spadra, spurring interest in land development in the area. In 1875, Phillips built the Phillips Mansion (now operated by the Historical Society of Pomona Valley) and also sold most of his for subdivision into the Pomona Tract, thus beginning the formation of Pomona. Phillips retained surrounding his mansion, which he operated as a cattle and sheep ranch. In 1867, Phillips married Esther Blake, with whom he had three sons (Charles, George and Louis, Jr.) and two daughters (Mrs. Frank George and adopted daughter, Kate Cecil).

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 242. Early history Tesselated tiles and Roman coins found near the parish church indicate that there was a Roman villa in the area of what later became Drayton village. Drayton village is Saxon in origin. Its toponym comes from the Old English drag meaning to carry goods. Manor After the Norman conquest of 1066 the conquering Normans dispossessed many Saxon landowners, but the Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton still belonged to a Saxon thegn, Turchil of Arden. However, in 1088 William the Conqueror created the Earldom of Warwick and thereafter gave Turchil's estates to the Norman nobleman Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. The Arden family seems to have remained as tenants of the Earldom, for in 1204 a Thomas Arden held the tenancy. In 1329 Sir Robert Arden was licensed to crenellate Drayton manor house. The male line of the Arden family ended in 1376 with the death of Sir Giles Arden, whose son had predeceased him. Sir Giles' granddaughters Margaret and Joan were minors, but on reaching their majority and marriage they inherited the Drayton estate. Joan and her husband surrendered their share of Drayton to Margaret who had married Lewis Greville. The house remained the seat of the Greville family until 1565, when a later Lewis Greville was heavily in debt and sold the manor to one Thomas Webb. By 1588 Thomas Webb had died leaving Drayton to his brother Richard and widow Katherine. Lewis Greville lured Richard Webb to Sezincote House in Gloucestershire where Greville got Webb drunk, persuaded him to write a will in Greville's favour and then murdered him. Greville was tried for murder, and because he refused to enter a plea he was executed by pressing instead of hanging. By 1598 most of the manor of Drayton belonged to Anthony Cope of Hanwell. In 1611 Elizabeth I made Cope Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet. Drayton remained with the Cope Baronets of Hanwell until the death of Sir John Cope, 5th Baronet in 1721. It then passed to another branch of the Cope family, Sir Jonathan Cope, 1st Baronet of Bruern. When Sir Charles Cope, 3rd Baronet died in 1781, Drayton passed to one of his sisters, Catherine. In 1790 Catherine's daughter Arabella was married to John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and received Drayton from her mother. In 1825 Drayton was inherited by the Duke and Duchess's younger daughter, Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr. When she died in 1870 her manorial rights passed to the North family of Wroxton Abbey. In about 1629 Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet sold a large acreage of land at Drayton to William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele of Broughton Castle. By 1790 the same property belonged to Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford of Wroxton Abbey. In 1935 and 1942 the Norths sold their lands at Drayton to Trinity College, Oxford. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was in existence by 1223. Its earliest surviving features are a Norman priest's doorway and the font. In the 14th century St Peter's was almost completely rebuilt and north and south aisles were added, all in the Decorated Gothic style. Lobel and Crossley contend that the clerestorey was added at the same time, but it is in the Perpendicular Gothic style and Sherwood and Pevsner contend it was added later. The low west tower was added in 1808 and has three 17th century bells: two cast in 1634 and two more cast in 1670. In 1878 the Gothic Revival architect Edwin Dolby restored the church and added a vestry. St Peter's is a Grade II* listed building. Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet (1550‚Äì1615) was a puritan, and in 1598 he presented Robert Cleaver, a presbyterian to be curate of Drayton. John Bridges, whom James I had appointed Bishop of Oxford in 1603, suspended Cleaver for failing to adhere to the Book of Common Prayer. In 1607 Sir Anthony Cope persuaded Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury to accept Henry Scudder as Drayton's new curate. In 1619 Scudder was succeeded by another puritan, Thomas Lodge, who was described as \\"a burning and a shining light\\" and was curate until 1651. A low church tradition survived in Drayton with John Dover, who was curate 1688‚Äì1725. From 1778 until the 1960s all of Drayton's curates were Evangelicals and most had served as missionaries in other continents. St Peter's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice. Social and economic history Hornton Stone house in Drayton The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton had a water mill, presumably on Sor Brook on the western boundary of the parish just below the village. There is then a gap of five centuries in which no mill is recorded, but records resume with a mill operating in the parish from 1589 until 1851. A parsonage was built in Drayton in the 16th century. In 1862 it was replaced by a large new rectory built on the same site by the architect Arthur Blomfield, but the Victorian house retains cellars built in the 17th century. The main road between Banbury and Warwick runs north‚Äìsouth along a ridge in the eastern part of the parish. It was made into a turnpike in 1744 and ceased to be one in 1871. In the 1920s it was classified as part of the A41 road. After the completion of the M40 motorway in 1990 this part of the A41 was \\"detrunked\\" and reclassified as the B4100. The main road between Banbury and Stratford- upon-Avon branches off the Banbury - Warwick road and descends through Drayton village to cross Sor Brook. An Act of Parliament to turn this road was passed in 1747 works to improve the road and establish toll houses were not undertaken until 1754. Since the 1920s it has been classified the A422 road. Drayton's earliest recorded public houses were licensed from 1753. By 1782 the village had two pubs, the Hare and Hounds and the Roebuck Inn. The last record of the Hare and Hounds is from 1806, but the Roebuck Inn continues to trade. It is a 17th-century Hornton Stone building with a thatched roof, and is controlled by the local Hook Norton Brewery. Thomas Webb had enclosed some of Drayton's farmland when he bought the manor from Lewis Greville in 1565, but the villagers farmed most of the parish on an open field system until it was enclosed in 1802. By 1833 Drayton had two day schools and a Sunday school. One of the day schools was still extant in 1855, when the 5th Earl De La Warr and Countess De La Warr had given two cottages to be converted into a schoolroom. This was rebuilt by 1891 but was still unsatisfactory and in 1900 a separate infants' classroom was built. The number of pupils declined in the 1930s and the school was closed in 1948.

The accident involved two vehicles, the first being a TechArt Porsche 997 Turbo that was participating in the Gumball 3000, and the second being a Volkswagen Golf. The latter was not involved in the Gumball 3000 event. Vladimir Chepunjoski, the driver of the Volkswagen, died at the scene. The passenger, Margarita Chepunjoski, was rushed to hospital but died two days later as a result of the injuries sustained in the crash. The driver and passenger in the Porsche were not seriously injured. Gumball 3000 The Gumball 3000 is an annual 3000 mile (4,800 km) international rally which takes place on public roads, which travels around the world. Although set up as a rally with no official timing, or prizes for reaching check points first, during the rally, some participants have been fined for speeding and other traffic offences by the police in countries they passed through, cars have been confiscated and the 2007 rally was canceled after a car participating in the rally was involved in a fatal collision with a non-participating vehicle. Although the organizers are careful to emphasize that it is a rally and not a race, it is sometimes referred to as a streetrace. The collision On May 2, the participants in the 2007 Rally were driving through the Republic of Macedonia on a route from the Macedonian-Greek border near Bitola to the border with Albania, near the town of Struga. The traffic accident occurred on the motorway M4, at the entrance of the town of Struga, about from the Macedonian-Albanian border post. The Porsche hit an oncoming Volkswagen Golf, which was making a left turn on to the main road from a side road and driving in the opposite direction of the Porsche. The Porsche hit the Golf head-on, and the crash pushed both vehicles off the road. A video of the immediate aftermath was subsequently posted to YouTube. Both the driver and the passenger in the Golf were heavily injured. The driver and the passenger of the Porsche seemed virtually unharmed, and they were immediately picked up by another Gumball 3000 participating vehicle, a BMW M6, and reported to a nearby police station where a breath test showed no alcohol was involved. They were arrested by the Macedonian police for endangering traffic. The casualties reported in the accident were the 67-year-old driver of the Golf, Vladimir Chepunjoski, who died on his way to the hospital, and his wife Margarita Chepunjoski, who died in hospital from injuries sustained in the crash on May 4. Nicholas was set free on bail of ¬£17,000 and handed his passport to return home. He was requested to return to Macedonia if a court called him to attend in the future; however during that time the 2nd fatality was confirmed by the hospital and so he was arrested again the next day in Skopje, while boarding a private jet. After this second arrest, he was detained in custody until the trial. The trial In court the prosecution alleged a speed of 161 km/h (100 mph) while the defense opposed this by saying that the speed of the incoming vehicle was not taken into account and that his driving speed was only 70‚Äì75 km/h. After the conviction verdict, Nicholas released a statement detailing its own expert's findings, which contradict those of the prosecution's expert. The statement also claims that the defence were denied the opportunity to present their expert's findings, which could contravene article 6 of the European convention on human rights, the right to a fair trial. Aftermath The organisers of the Gumball 3000 initially continued the rally despite the incident, in a later official statement the organisers stated that the clear details of the incident and confirmation of a fatality did not occur until some hours after the briefing, at which point the decision to cancel the remainder of the rally was made. Adidas, a sponsor to the 2007 Gumball 3000, immediately backed out as a rally sponsor and took all Gumball 3000 related merchandise off the market internationally.

Both sets of lobes pass symmetrically through the center of the elliptical galaxy that is the source of the lobes, giving the radio galaxy an X-shaped morphology as seen on radio maps (see figure). X-shaped sources were first described by J. P. Leahy and P. Parma in 1992, who presented a list of 11 such objects. The X-shaped galaxies have received much attention following the suggestion in 2002 that they might be the sites of spin-flips associated with the recent coalescence of two supermassive black holes. Properties X-shaped galaxies are a sub-class of Fanaroff-Riley Type II (FRII) radio galaxies. FRII objects exhibit a pair of large (kiloparsec) scale radio lobes that straddle the parent elliptical galaxy; the lobes are believed to consist of plasma ejected from the center of the galaxy by jets associated with the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. Unlike the classical FRII sources, the X-shaped galaxies exhibit two, misaligned pairs of radio lobes of comparable extent. One pair of lobes, the \\"active\\" lobes, have a relatively high surface brightness and appear to be generated by ongoing emission from the center of the galaxy. The second set, the \\"wings\\", have a lower surface brightness, and appear to consist of plasma that was ejected along a different axis than that associated with the active lobes. The wings are also observed to have a higher spectral index than the active lobes and are highly polarized.Murgia, M. (2001), A multi-frequency study of the radio galaxy NGC 326, Astron. Astrophys., 380, 102 With one exception,Wang, T. et al. (2003), 4C +01.30: An X-shaped Radio Source with a Quasar Nucleus, Astron. J., 126, 113-118 none of the X-shaped sources shows the broad, optical emission lines associated with quasar activity. The host galaxies mostly exhibit high ellipticities and a number have nearby companion galaxies.  Origin  In their original catalog of 11 X-shaped galaxies, Leahy and ParmaLeahy, J. P. and Parma, P. (1992), Multiple outbursts in radio galaxies, Proc. 7th. I.A.P. Meeting: Extragalactic Radio Sources. From Beams to Jets, 307-308 proposed that the \\"wings were created in an earlier outburst, some tens of Myrs previous to the current renewal of nuclear activity, during which time the ejection axis has precessed.\\" They noted that their proposal was consistent with the low surface brightness, steep radio spectrum, and high polarization of the wings, all of which are features associated with old (inactive) radio sources. A widely discussed model for the origin of the X-shaped sources invokes a spin-flip of the supermassive black hole.Merritt, D. and Ekers, R. (2002), Tracing black hole mergers through radio lobe morphology, Science, 297, 1310 In this model, a galaxy merger causes a second, smaller supermassive black hole to be deposited near the center of the original radio galaxy. The smaller black hole forms a binary system with the larger black hole before the two coalesce via the emission of gravitational waves. During the coalescence, the spin axis of the larger hole undergoes a sudden reorientation due to absorption of the smaller hole's orbital angular momentum‚Äîa \\"spin-flip.\\" Since the lobes are produced by jets that are launched perpendicularly to the inner accretion disk, and since the accretion disk is constrained by the Bardeen- Petterson effect to lie perpendicular to the black hole's spin axis, a change in the spin orientation implies a change in the direction of the lobes. Even a rather small infalling black hole, with a mass approximately one-fifth that of the larger hole, could cause the spin of the latter to change by ninety degrees. Alternative models to explain the X-shaped sources include a warping instability of the accretion disk;Pringle, J. E. (1996), Self-induced warping of accretion discs, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 281, 357-361 backflow of gas along the active lobesLeahy, J. P. and Williams, A. G. (1984), The bridges of classical double radio sources, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 210, 929-951 and binary-disk interactions before coalescence.Liu, F. K. (2004), X-shaped radio galaxies as observational evidence for the interaction of supermassive binary black holes and accretion disc at parsec scale, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 347, 1357-1369 It is likely that all of these mechanisms are active at some level and that the time scale for realignment influences the radio source morphology, with the most rapid realignments producing the X-shaped sources, while slower realignment would cause the jet to deposit its energy into a larger volume, leading to an S-shaped FRI radio source.

She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line. Construction Vigil (YAGR-12) was laid down on 14 December 1944, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 2339, as the Liberty Ship Raymond Van Brogan, by J.A. Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched 27 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Anne Durham, wife of manager machinery JAJCC; and delivered 10 February 1945, to the War Shipping Administration. Service history Merchant service Following a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship transited the Panama Canal, on 19 February, and headed for Terminal Island, California, where she was turned over to A.H.Bull & Co.Inc., for operation under contract to the War Shipping Administration. She performed several resupply missions in the Pacific Ocean theater, carrying aircraft as well as other materiel and some troops. Following the end of World War II, the War Shipping Administration transferred her contract to the Waterman Steamship Corporation, which firm operated her from Mobile, Alabama. In the summer of 1947, Raymond Van Brogan was taken out of service and berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Mobile. US Navy service Nine years later, in June 1956, she was brought out of the US Maritime Commission's (MARCOM) reserve fleet for conversion to a radar picket ship and active service with the Navy. She was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she completed her conversion at the naval shipyard. On 7 August 1956, she received a new name and her Navy hull designation to become Vigil (YAGR-12). She completed conversion early in 1957, and was placed in service on 5 March 1957, Lieutenant Commander Stanley Abstetar, USNR, in command. During Vigils eight-year naval career, she was assigned to the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) and served as one of that organization's radar picket ships operating as seaward extensions of its radar coverage system. The ship operated out of Davisville, Rhode Island, during her entire period of service, and spent on the average of 200 days per year actually engaged in picket patrols in waters off the coast of New England. On 28 September 1958, she was redesignated AGR-12, thereby dropping her yard craft designation and becoming a commissioned auxiliary. Decommissioning On 3 March 1965, Vigil was placed out of commission. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1965, and she was returned to the MARCOM for lay up with the Hudson River Reserve Fleet, Jones Point, New York. On 23 November 1970, she was sold to the Spanish firm, Revalorizacion de Materiales, for scrapping.

Early life and education Magomed Yevloyev was born in the town of Malgobek, Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now in the Republic of Ingushetia, Russia) in 1971.–ï–≤–ª–æ–µ–≤, –ú–∞–≥–æ–º–µ–¥ collection of materials on Lenta.ru library In 1992, Yevloyev graduated from Saratov Law Institute (–°–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –Æ—Ä–∏–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç). Career After graduation, Yevloyev began to work as a public procurator in Ingushetia. He soon became the Deputy Chief Procurator of Malgobek. In 1999, he was accused of complicity in the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev, who was at that time imprisoned as a kidnapper. Allegedly Yevloyev had signed the permit allowing the murderers to take Tsechoyev from his cell. The accusations were not proven but Yevloyev resigned from his post as a prosecutor. In 2001, Yevloyev founded the Moscow legal firm Infra-Yur. In 2008, the firm became Infra Holding, a company which oversaw construction, fishing, legal firms, and security bureaus. It also controlled Infra North America, a daughter firm operating in the United States. Yevloyev was the president of this holding. Also in 2001, Yevloyev created the website \\"Ingushetia.ru\\". Originally there was no intention to make an opposition website; Yevloyev planned to host a neutral collection of materials on the history and culture of the Ingush people, without favoring any particular point of view. But he soon found that historical and cultural materials often included explosive political content as well, and the site became a source of political materials, such as information on the Second Chechen War, counter- terrorist operations, the Ossetian‚ÄìIngush conflict, and kidnappings and murders in Ingushetia. Many of these materials were highly critical of Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov and his government. In July 2007, the public procurator of Moscow's Kuntsevo municipality initiated a criminal case accusing Yevloyev of \\"inciting inter-ethnic hatred\\", though in the end Yevloyev was never indicted for any criminal activities. In October 2007, the Tsechoyev murder case was reopened and Yevloyev's family house in Malgobek was searched. After the search, Yevloyev's father, Yakhyu Yevloyev, convinced his son to publicly sever all ties with the Ingushetia.ru site, as it appeared to be too dangerous. Since then, the site has been controlled by an editorial committee chaired by Ibragim Kostoyev. Yevloyev did not, however, completely withdraw from the politics of Ingushetia. He was one of the organizers of the I did not vote campaign, intended to expose mass voter fraud in Ingushetia during the 2008 Russian presidential election. According to official data, 98% of eligible Ingushetia voters took part in the elections, almost all voting for Dmitry Medvedev. But Yevloyev alleged that less than half of registered voters had actually participated in the elections, and therefore sought to compile a list of people who could personally guarantee that they did not vote in the election. If the list proved to include more than 2% of Ingushetia's voting registry, it might constitute proof of massive election fraud. Yevloyev also organized and financed a campaign collecting signatures calling for the removal of Ingushetia President Zyazikov, and the restoration of the previous Ingushetia president Ruslan Aushev. In the beginning of 2008, the office of the Ingushetia public procurator initiated hearings in Kuntsevo Court, demanding that access to the site Ingushetia.ru be restricted. According to the prosecutors, in an interview with Ingushetia businessman Musa Keligov hosted on the site, Keligov directly accused Zyazikov of connections with guerillas. The prosecutors argued that this material constituted libel as well as \\"public advocacy of extremist activity\\". In May 2008, the court issued an injunction demanding that Russian providers \\"limit access to the site by filtering its IP addresses\\". In June 2008, the court characterized the site as \\"extremist\\" and demanded its closure. The site was not closed. According to Ingushetia.ru's lawyer Kaloy Akhilgov, since the site is registered in the United States, it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of Russian courts. Akhilgov also stated that the decision is technically incorrect because it classifies the site under the heading \\"mass media\\" despite the fact that the site is not officially registered as such. Akhilgov added that they intended to appeal the court decision.

The Apology and the Last Days) is the first studio album by Yugoslav new wave band Idoli released in 1982. D≈æuboks magazine critics voted the album the greatest Yugoslav rock album of the 20th century in 1985. The album was polled in 1998 as Yugoslav greatest popular music album in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music). In 2015, Odbrana i poslednji dani was polled the greatest Yugoslav rock album in the special edition of Croatian Rolling Stone.  Overview  The band started recording their first long play album during autumn 1981. The record was originally supposed to be produced by the band members themselves with the assistance of Du≈°an \\"Spira\\" Mihajloviƒá, however, Mihajloviƒá soon left the recording sessions, so the album recordings were produced only with help from Mile \\"Pile\\" Miletiƒá and Goran Vejvoda. The band's initial plan was an album dealing with religion and tradition, which was seen as potentially provocative due to many aspects of these topics still being a taboo in communist Yugoslavia's public sphere at the time. This was the first release that included a lineup change as Kokan Popoviƒá who used to play with Vlada Divljan and Zdenko Kolar in Zvuk Ulice now joined Idoli as their new drummer. The record was named after Borislav Pekiƒá's 1977 novella Odbrana i poslednji dani. Entering the studio, the band members still weren't entirely clear on what they wanted to do, either stylistically or musically. They had many ideas (within the specific context of Pekiƒá's work, and also in broader philosophical scope), but turning them into music and finding satisfactory sound presented a challenge. Due to this experimental trial-and-error approach, the recording process ended up taking almost six months. Since Idoli were already well-known and popular all across the country, the recording process was documented in Yugoslav media whose many print outlets wondered about the group's creative potential and ability to cope with such ambitious project in light of the fact that it's taking them so long to record the album. Beside the guitar, Divljan also played the piano, while ≈†aper played keyboards and synthesizers. Guest appearances featured Goran Vejvoda (Casio synthesizer on \\"Kenozoik\\" and \\"Odbrana\\" in addition to guitar on \\"Gde si sad cica-maco\\"), Mile \\"Pile\\" Miletiƒá (guitar solo on \\"Gde si sad cica-maco\\"), and Bebi Dol (backing vocals on \\"Odbrana\\"). The track \\"Senke su drugaƒçije\\" featured Vuk Vujaƒçiƒá (saxophone), Goran Grbiƒá (trumpet) and Slobodan Grozdanoviƒá (trombone). Since the recording process lasted far too long for Jugoton's liking, the label wanted to release the album as soon as possible. The record came out very quickly in early 1982. Unlike the band's previous releases, which were well accepted both commercially and critically, the new album had the critics divided with reactions ranging from extremely positive to extremely negative. Since the band wanted to present the record as non-commercial, no promotional videos were recorded for the album. Fifty thousand copies of the album were sold in Yugoslavia, which was in sharp contrast to the band's previous release, the VIS Idoli EP, that sold roughly 200,000 copies. This resulted the stylistic change of the next album the band recorded.  Album cover and design  The White Angel. It is often said that the original album cover was supposed to be a reproduction of the Mile≈°eva monastery fresco \\"White Angel\\". D≈æuboks magazine even published an article about the upcoming Idoli album with the reproduction as the album cover, but Vlada Divljan has recently squashed such rumours stating that this was never supposed to be the cover, adding that he never liked that idea, even as a rumour. He also explained that it would've been a bit much had they ever thought of choosing it for the cover since the album itself contains lyrics that can be considered rather blasphemous. It was further rumoured that Jugoton did not agree with the cover, considering it provocative in communist Yugoslavia where religion was very much suppressed. As the alternate solution, photographer and designer Goranka Matiƒá, who did the cover, went to the National Museum in Belgrade and took the photo which was used as the album cover. It was chosen to be a cloth detail from a Saint Nicholas icon. Many people also found the shape of the pattern to be similar to the Swastika and thought it was used as a topic on the album, but Divljan stated that any resemblance of the Swastika was unintentional and that people were reading too much into it. The back cover was a detail from a golden background of the icon. The inner sleeve featured a classical civil photo of the band on the left side and a similar photo of the guests and people involved with the recording on the right side. The font used on the record was a Cyrillic font similar to the one used in the Miroslav's Gospel. The re- release of the album did not feature Cyrillic letters except for the front cover. Also the names were misspelled and thus the album was called Obrana i posljednji dani, Joca Vi≈°koviƒá became Joca ƒêiskoviƒá, Dragutin Vulinoviƒá was changed to Dragutin ƒêulinoviƒá.  Album concept  The story of the album was inspired by a Borislav Pekiƒá book Odbrana i poslednji dani. The novel is a comical view on a man who was a lifeguard on the Tisa river during the last years of the World War II. The man, not very educated, got arrested because he found his first drowned victim, a German soldier. The story of the novel continues with presenting and making fun of his internal conflicts due to his lack of knowledge and a macho attitude. Idoli used the mental state of this man who was disoriented and confused with his surroundings and moved it to the urban background and the present moment (used in the song \\"Kenozoik\\"). At any point the story of the novel is connected to the album story as the band focused only on the psychological approach of the novel. The song \\"Poslednji dani\\" (originally entitled \\"Mar≈°al\\") represents a man who feels very joyous and romantic at night, a time when his hidden personality shows up. Unlike the man in the novel, who loves the river and enjoys spending time at the empty river bank as the river is his \\"God\\", the man in the song loves his Marshal (Tito) who is his \\"God\\". The record company did not agree with the last verse of the song as it was directly referring to Josip Broz Tito so the band had to change the song title and remove the last verse. \\"Moja si\\" is one of the strangest Idoli songs. The main character personality becomes divided, and his male personality becomes substituted with a female. In the mirror he sees a woman he would like to be, filled with strange comparisons and statements that shows a deep psychological disorder, which in a different form happened to the main character of the novel. \\"Senke su drugaƒçije\\" present a man determined to leave home. He feels a complete alienation in his surroundings, but is also afraid to leave as the paths are \\"narrow and dangerous\\". The structure of the song is keyboard and brass oriented with a march rhythm. In the novel the main character was forced to go to Germany. The story continues with \\"Nemo\\" in which the man is completely occupied with the thoughts of the place he is in and continues wandering in the world he can not adopt to. The next two tracks deal with a complete opposition to the main character in the novel. The first \\"Rusija\\" is a romantic ballad about a college student who lives in an apartment with his girlfriend which is a very strong working-class girl. The main character in the novel did not study and did not like dancing which is the topic of \\"Igrale se delije\\", a rockabilly song which calls everyone to dance. The backing vocals lyrics include \\"Igrale se delije nasred zemlje Srbije\\" which was a popular poem written by Serbian poet Milorad M. Petroviƒá Seljanƒçica (1875-1921). \\"Jedina (Uzurlikzurli)\\" is a rockabilly song which tells the story of a man who would like to tell a girl he loves her but has a problem doing it. \\"Odbrana\\" (originally entitled \\"Isus je na≈° maj\\") is a sophisticated song about a lonely man who is far away from everything he loves and who misses his old life by the river. \\"Glavna ptica (skrati svoj dugaƒçki jezik)\\" is talking about barricades, tear-gas, road blocks which are connected to war, the man in the novel could not understand.  Live performances  Following the release of the album, the band went on tour, but the new album did not reach the audience as their previous releases. The only song which was well accepted by the audience was \\"Kenozoik\\" which was usually played first on live appearances. One of the first live shows the band did was in Zagreb club Kulu≈°iƒá where Dragan Vulinoviƒá, who worked in Radio Belgrade as sound engineer, dressed in black and holding a thurible containing incence was walking along the stage as a thurifer. In Belgrade instead of Vulinoviƒá this job was given to a girl. The reaction of the critics to using orthodox elements on concerts was described as \\"Rock with the smell of incence\\". The shows lasted for more than two hours and had several encore calls. Since Idoli never recorded a live album and live bootleg recordings are very rare, there are no live recordings from this tour. Vlada Divljan with his Old Stars Band often performed songs from Odbrana i poslednji dani and most of the songs from the album appeared on his live album Odbrana i za≈°tita in 1996.  Accolades  * It was pronounced the best album and the best album design of the year 1982. * Odbrana i poslednji dani was one of the few Yugoslav albums reviewed by NME. It received a very positive and affirmative review. * In 1983, editors and critics from eight leading European magazines (Actuel, The Face, Wiener, etc.) selected Idoli the third among the ten most promising bands in Europe. * In 1985, D≈æuboks magazine critics voted Odbrana i poslednji dani the best Yugoslav rock album of the 20th century. * A special award was given by a French magazine which reviewed the album as one of the best European releases in 1982 along with the releases of Falco, Yello, and Depeche Mode. Re- release The album was one of the first Yugoslav rock albums to be re- released on CD in 1990 with the re-release of Paket aran≈æman. Since there were mistakes they did not want to release it until 1992 when a record dealer bought the printed releases and sold them in Belgrade at a very high price. There were 40,000 copies and were sold out in a short period of time. In 2007 the album appeared on Croatia Records' box set VIS Idoli featuring all studio efforts except the \\"Vidici\\" single.

Those banks, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank (Agroprombank), the Industrial and Construction Bank (Promstroybank), and the Commercial Bank of Kyrgyzstan, owned 85 percent of banking assets in 1994. New commercial banks, of which fifteen were established in 1993 and 1994, were owned by individuals or enterprises and had much less financial power than the state-owned banks. The new commercial banks have the right to buy and sell foreign currency and open deposit accounts. The National Bank is the official center of currency exchange, but in the mid-1990s it did not adhere to official exchange rates. In mid-1994, the government established the Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which uses state funds, foreign currency assets, and loans from abroad to aid small and medium-sized enterprises and to invest in targeted spheres of the economy, especially housing, construction, power generation, and agriculture. The banking system has remained concentrated in the same areas as in the Soviet period. Although some diversification has occurred, loans tend to go to traditional clients. Because new commercial banks are small and initially were owned by state ministries and state-owned enterprises, competition has developed slowly. Through 1994 Soviet-style accounting and reporting systems remained in use, and banking services such as domestic and international payments have remained at the same noncompetitive level as they were prior to 1991. Capabilities vital to a market-type economy, such as credit risk assessment and project appraisal, are lacking. Post-Soviet regulations on capital funds, exposure limits, and lending practices have not been enforced. The technical infrastructure of the banks also requires substantial overhaul. In addition, the National Bank has been plagued by scandal; the first director, an Akayev prot√©g√©, was linked to several illegal financial operations in 1993 and 1994. The limitations of the banking system have made it unable to efficiently mobilize and allocate financial resources into the national economy. This failure has hindered privatization and other types of economic reform that require substantial amounts of risk capital upon which borrowers can rely. Especially critical are the bad loans held by the three state-owned banks (influenced by government interference in loan decisions, together with poor financial discipline on the part of major enterprises) and eroded capital base. In 1995 the National Bank's outstanding loans to agricultural and industrial enterprises totaled 1 billion som each.

It is historically significant for its long association with education and civic life in Easley in the first half of the 20th century. The building served as Easley's first and only high school from 1909 to 1940 and was central to the early experience and training of almost every local resident of that period. Architecture Architecturally, the load-bearing masonry building in the Renaissance Revival style is significant for its early efforts to introduce steel trusses into traditional masonry- bearing wall and heavy timber construction. It has also been noted as an outstanding early example of the work of architects Frank H. and Joseph G. Cunningham. The building illustrates the early use of steel trusses to provide a clear-span auditorium with 18-foot ceilings., Section 7, page 5 At the time of construction, use of steel trusses was still in the experimental phase. The design of the building is an early example of ‚Äúthe gradual replacement of load-bearing masonry and heavy timber structures with steel frame construction.‚Äù, Section 8, page 8 The building has 86 tall windows with segmental arches, laid out like those in many textile mills in the region. Later Use When the building opened in the fall of 1909, its classrooms allowed the seventh through tenth grades to have their own rooms for the first time (an eleventh grade was added in the 1920-21 school year. The school had outgrown the facility by 1938 and a new building was constructed on a different site in 1939-40. Following completion of the new school building, the auditorium was occupied by a shirt manufacturer until 1964. From that time until its listing on the National Register, the building went through various periods of vacancy and occupation by a local furniture store for limited storage use. Recent Restoration The building had fallen into disrepair when the Easley Chamber of Commerce applied for its recognition as one of the most-endangered properties in the state. Occupants of the building following its use as a school had torn out interior classroom walls, a portion of the roof had been destroyed as the result of wind damage from a 1998 storm (this was replaced with temporary corrugated metal sheets), and metal panels had been installed over many windows to prevent water damage. All but one original chimney as well as an entry porch on the building's south side had been removed, \\"virtually all windows and doors\\" and much of the plaster work were \\"severely deteriorated\\". Following a 1997 study that identified the building as a key ingredient in downtown Easley's revitalization, the town engaged in a period of planning on how to return it to a place of prominence within the community. In the early 2000s the building was rehabilitated and restored to private use as residential condominiums. The building stands at 112 Russell Street and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The South Carolina Department of Archives and History has additional pictures and information, as well as the NRHP nomination document.

History The area around this hot springs was originally inhabited by the local native Paiutes, who considered the waters sacred. Today there is a very small community of homes, and a commercial resort featuring a large swimming pool which was built and first opened in August 1918 by Philip P. Keough, a former local superintendent of the Wells Fargo stage company. Keough's resort was very popular in the 1920s and 30's and was designed to be a complete health resort. The resort reportedly continued to be a very popular social gathering site for residents of the nearby communities up until the World War II era. In 1926 the City of Los Angeles purchased the property as a part of its famous water- rights land grab in the Owens Valley. The City's Water and Power Department allowed the resort to remain open under its direction, but absentee management led to a decline in the resort's viability. Leases were offered to various operators, but with only a five-year term. The pool was closed to the public in 1934, but was reopened a few years later by another operator. A new lessee in 1955 performed renovations and the pool once again regained its vitality as a public swimming and recreation area until insurance considerations dictated that it become a membership-only club in 1985. Today In 1998 the Brown Family of Bishop purchased the resort and began major renovation work: a snack bar, picnic area, boutique, massage rooms, and fitness facility complement the pool and therapeutic tubs. Keough Hot Ditch Downstream from the pool, and outside of the small community of Keough's, the hot water cascades down a series of small primitive soaking/wading pools and bathing locations, as the water makes its way toward the Los Angeles Aqueduct. This area, known as the \\"hot ditch,\\" is utilized as a recreational area where social nudity is practiced.

Over one third of the buildings in the district are Federal or Georgian architecture dating from the 1780s to 1850, reflecting Bardstown's status as one of the first towns in Kentucky, first settled in 1780 and formally established in 1788. Twenty-four of the blocks are in the initial grid pattern used to lay out the town's lots in 1797.Thomason, Phil. Bardstown Historic District NRHP Nomination Form (Thomason and Associates, 1982) Sec. 7, p. 0, Sec. 8, p. 0 The town was originally to be called Salem when it was first settled in 1780 by 33 people, on land given as grant to John Owings and David Bard by Virginia governor Patrick Henry. Bard sent his brother William Bard to manage the holdings, and with William donating for a courthouse, the town was renamed Bardstown. In 1789 alone 150 log houses were built in the district. In the antebellum area the district became a cultural center for nearby localities, especially for Catholics; Bardstown had the largest concentration of Catholics of any town in Kentucky for a time. Its decline began when the Louisville and Nashville Railroad decided to initially bypass Bardstown, not building a railroad for the town until 1860, and not extending the line from Bardstown until 1887, after which Bardstown's population remained steady until it became the center of bourbon production.Kleber, John E.

The Six accepts lenses with the Pentacon Six mount, a breech-lock bayonet mount.  History   Praktisix  The Praktisix was manufactured by Kamera Werkst√§tten (KW). It is a 6√ó6 SLR modelled on contemporary 35 mm SLRs. It was followed by the Praktisix II and Praktisix IIA, all with minor, relatively cosmetic changes. They all have rather poor reliability, including poor frame spacing.  Pentacon Six  In 1959 Kamera Werkst√§tten became VEB Kamera and KinoWerke Dresden. In 1964 they became VEB Pentacon and in 1970, Kombinat VEB Pentacon. With the unification of the East German photographic industry the Praktisix was modified to become the Pentacon Six. Frame spacing was improved through the use of a roller with teeth that is turned by the film as it advances; when the correct length of film has advanced, the mechanism disengages. When the TTL-metered prism was introduced, the letters 'TL' were added to the name plate but no other changes were made to the camera body. The Pentacon Six was imported into the U.S. as the Hanimex Praktica 66 by Australian distributor Hanimex. This was to get around U.S. laws prohibiting direct imports from communist countries. The Pentacon Six TLs is a version modified to shoot 4√ó4.5 cm frames for photo IDs.  Exakta 66  Exakta 66 The Exakta 66 is based on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the film advance lever moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses. The Exakta 66 is not to be confused with several earlier cameras with nearly exactly the same name. These Exakta 6x6 cameras were produced by Ihagee, Dresden, in the pre-war years and with interruptions until 1954.  Viewfinders  The Praktisix and Pentacon Six comes with a simple waist-level finder with a flip-up cover. A non-metered prism was available for the Pentacon Six, with a TTL-metered prism produced later. A third-party adaptor allows the metered prism from the Kiev 60 (which is based externally on the Pentacon Six) to be attached to most Pentacon Sixes and Exakta 66's. It is brighter, shows more of the view, and is available new. The same adaptor also allows the Kiev 60 waist-level finder to be used. This finder is reportedly inspired by the one found on Rolleiflex TLR cameras and is also better than the original Pentacon finder.

The lens mount was originally designed by Carl Zeiss Jena and Kamera Werkst√§tten (KW) for the Praktisix camera. KW later merged with several other companies to become VEB Pentacon; the Praktisix was improved and renamed the Pentacon Six. This camera was manufactured for a much longer time (almost 40 years) and exported widely; hence the lens mount became associated most with the Pentacon Six name, rather than the original Praktisix.  Variants   Original  The P6 mount is a simple bayonet mount. It has three short tabs on the lens; they are identical and correct orientation is assured by the placement of a post in front of the \\"top\\" tab. A pin holds the diaphragm open for fully open metering and focusing; this pin is released before the shutter is opened. The flange focal distance of mount is 74.1 mm. The lens is inserted into the front of the camera and is held in place by a rotating collar. This variant is seen on the Praktisix, Pentacon Six, Kiev 6C and Kiev 60.  Exakta 66  The Exakta 66 added a TTL metered prism coupled to the shutter speed dial on the camera body and the aperture ring on the lens. It does this by projecting slightly over the front of the camera, allowing a rotating cam on the specially designed Schneider lenses to tell it what aperture setting was selected. And for lenses with a maximum aperture other than , a separate pin projects from the lens to the prism to tell it the maximum aperture.  Kiev 88 modifications  The Kiev 88 is essentially a clone of the first Hasselblad - the 1600F/1000F. Like the Hasselblad, it has a threaded lens mount and Kiev-Arsenal manufactured its lens range in both the Pentacon Six mount (for the Kiev 60) and the Kiev 88 screw mount. However, there was interest in using Pentacon Six mount lenses from Carl Zeiss Jena and others on this camera (nicknamed the Hasselbladski). Thus various third parties worked to machine a P6-compatible lens mount into the Kiev 88. A major issue is the fact that the Kiev 88 has a greater flange focal distance than the Pentacon Six, requiring the lens to be recessed into the front of the modified Kiev 88. This causes physical clearance issues with some lenses, particularly the Exakta 66 lenses with a cam and possibly a pin for coupling the lens to a TTL prism. A consequence of these early modifications is that the lens mount became twist-lock instead of breach-lock; the lens is inserted and turned.  Kiev 88–°–ú  The Kiev 88–°–ú is a later version of the Kiev 88 manufactured with a P6 mount from the factory. Like the earlier Kiev 88 modifications, the lens is recessed in the front of the camera body. However it returns to the breach-lock origins of the mount. It has an \\"internal collar\\" that is turned by a tab accessible from the front of the camera.

This spin- off material is licensed and moderated by Lucasfilm, though during his involvement with the franchise George Lucas reserved the right to both draw from and contradict it in his own works. Such derivative works have been produced concurrently with, between, and after the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies, as well as the spin-off films and television series. Commonly explored media include books, comic books, and video games, though other forms such as audio dramas have also been produced. With the exception of the CGI-animated The Clone Wars TV series, non-film material produced prior to April 2014 was collectively known as the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU). Lucasfilm later rebranded the Expanded Universe as Star Wars Legends and declared it non-canonical to the franchise. Most works produced after April 25, 2014, are part of the official canon as defined by Lucasfilm, although a handful of Legends media has been released after that date. Publication history 1976‚Äì1987: Early films and television series The first Star Wars spinoff material was Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker (1976), the novelization of the 1977 film. Lucas later commissioned Alan Dean Foster, who ghostwrote the novelization, to write a sequel, which resulted in Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978). Lucas originally intended to use this as the basis for a potential low-budget sequel to Star Wars, but when it became one of the most successful films of all time, Lucas decided to write his own story for the film sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980). While this was in production, Lucas approved the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), which he had limited involvement with. Running from April 1977 to May 1986, the Star Wars comic book series from Marvel Comics met with such strong sales that former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter credited it with saving Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978. The series became one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980. An adaptation of the third theatrical film, Return of the Jedi, was released as a separate four-issue limited series (1983‚Äì1984). Two novel trilogies with original storylines were written, The Han Solo Adventures by Brian Daley (1979‚Äì1980), and 1983's The Adventures of Lando Calrissian by L. Neil Smith. Daley also wrote radio dramatizations of the original trilogy, which aired in 1981, 1983, and 1996. The first Star Wars electronic game was released in 1979 by Kenner, followed by a handful of Atari and Parker Brothers video games in the early 1980s, mainly adaptations of film scenes. Two spin- off television films focusing on the life of the Ewoks, introduced in Return of the Jedi, aired in 1984 and 1985. The furry creatures were also the subject of an American/Canadian animated television series produced by Nelvana, which ran for two seasons between 1985 and 1986. A sister series, Droids, features the further adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO. In 1985, Marvel Comics' Star Comics imprint published a bi-monthly Ewoks tie-in comic, which ran for two years, and in 1986, published an eight-issue Droids series. The two series featured a crossover storyline. The Star Tours ride was opened at Disney Parks in 1987 to commemorate the saga's 10th anniversary. 1987‚Äì1991: \\"The Dark Times\\" Following the series' 10th anniversary, the release of Star Wars spin-off media was largely halted. In 1987, the fan newsletter Bantha Tracks was absorbed by the official Lucasfilm magazine, which focused on the company's projects outside of Star Wars. Some fans feared that the franchise had come to an end, and the period between 1987 and 1991 has been called the \\"Dark Times\\". There were some bright spots in this era, however. In 1987, West End Games began publishing Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, and the subsequent ancillary role-playing game material such as sourcebooks, gamebooks, and adventure modules. These have been called \\"the first publications to expand greatly beyond what was known from the vintage era of the movies\\". The material was used as a resource by some later novelists. 1991‚Äì1996: Thrawn novels and Dark Empire comics The lack of new Star Wars material ended with the 1991 release of Timothy Zahn's novel Heir to the Empire. Heir to the Empire, which reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list, began what would become a large collection of works set before, between, and especially after the original films. StarWars.com wrote in 2014 that the novel \\"jumpstarted a publishing program that endures to this day and formalized the Expanded Universe\\". It introduced, among others, the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade, and was followed by the sequels Dark Force Rising (1992) and The Last Command (1993). The Thrawn trilogy is widely credited with revitalizing the Star Wars franchise. In The Secret History of Star Wars, Michael Kaminski suggests this renewed interest was a factor in Lucas's decision to create the prequel trilogy. Around this same time, the comics license was transferred to Dark Horse Comics, who launched a number of series set after the original film trilogy, including the popular Dark Empire sequence (1991‚Äì1995) by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy. The comic launched months after the first Thrawn novel and was a sequel to those novels; it notably resurrected the film characters Emperor Palpatine and Boba Fett. Zahn was critical of the concept of resurrecting Emperor Palpatine through cloned bodies, feeling it undermined and contradicted the meaning of the ending of Return of the Jedi. The Jedi Prince series of young-reader novels, released between 1992 and 1993, depicts Luke, Leia, and Han about a year after Return of the Jedi. The Truce at Bakura (1993) depicts the immediate aftermath of the aforementioned film. In 1993, Dark Horse published Tales of the Jedi, expanding the fictional universe to the time of the Old Republic, approximately 4,000 years before the films. The series spawned many other productions, including books, further comics, and eventually the Knights of the Old Republic computer roleplaying games. In 1994, Lucas Licensing's Allan Kausch and Sue Rostoni discussed the relationship between Lucas' creations and the derivative works by other authors: 1996‚Äì1999: Special Editions and Shadows of the Empire The 1996 Steve Perry novel Shadows of the Empire, set in the as-yet-unexplored time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, was part of a multimedia campaign that also included a comic book series and video game. The multimedia project was largely meant to reinvigorate the franchise ahead of the prequel trilogy, along with Lucas's 1997 Special Editions of the original trilogy. Lucas incorporated elements of the Expanded Universe into the Special Editions; for example, Coruscant, the New Republic capital planet created by Zahn in the Thrawn trilogy, made its film debut in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, before being featured more heavily in the prequel trilogy. An eponymous comic book series, later subtitled Republic, launched in 1998 and introduced Ki-Adi-Mundi ahead of his appearance in the films. In 1999, Star Wars book publishing moved from Bantam Spectra to Del Rey Books. A new series set between 25 and 30 years after the original films, The New Jedi Order (1999‚Äì2003), was written by multiple authors and introduced a new threat: the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy. The first novel in the series, R. A. Salvatore's Vector Prime, killed off popular character Chewbacca. 1999‚Äì2014: Prequel film trilogy and The Clone Wars Before 1999, the bulk of Expanded Universe storytelling explored the time periods either after Return of the Jedi or long before A New Hope (e.g. the Tales of the Jedi series). The time period shortly before the original trilogy (including the rise of the Galactic Empire and the personal histories of Anakin Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine) was left open for Lucas to develop in the form of a prequel trilogy, which begin with Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999). The character Aayla Secura, introduced in 2000 in the Republic comic book series, appears in Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002). The 2003 animated series Clone Wars and various spin-off books, comics, and video games explore the titular conflict in more detail leading up to Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). Ahead of the film's release, Lucas announced a 3D \\"continuation\\" of Clone Wars, which was released as the animated film The Clone Wars (2008) and a television series of the same name (2008‚Äì2014). These reveal that Anakin had a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, during this period. Various characters seen only briefly in the films or in other spin-off material are featured in more depth. At this time, Lucas denied any plans to ever make a Star Wars sequel trilogy. =Holocron database and canonicity= Originally, Lucasfilm tracked the narrative content of the Expanded Universe in story bibles. In 2000, LucasArts lead tester Leland Chee was hired as Continuity Database Administrator for Lucas Licensing, and developed a database of franchise continuity based in part on 1998's encyclopedic Star Wars: Behind the Magic . The database came to be known as the Holocron, a term used within the Star Wars universe for \\"ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom\\". The Holocron consists of over 55,000 entries for franchise characters, locations, species, and vehicles. As of 2004, over 1,100 Star Wars titles had been published, including novels, comics, non-fiction, and magazines. Then-president of Lucas Licensing, Howard Roffman, estimated that there were more than 65 million Star Wars books in print. He said, \\"The books are a way of extending the fantasy of Star Wars. The movies have had a really profound effect on a couple of generations. Star Wars has become a cultural touchpoint, and our fans are avidly interested in exploring more stories.\\" Regarding the Holocron database in 2012, Chee said: \\"What sets Star Wars apart from other franchises is that we develop a singular continuity across all forms of media, whether it be the films, TV series, video games, novels and comics, and the Holocron is a key component to Lucasfilm being able to do this.\\" The Holocron was divided into five levels of canon (in order of precedence): *G-canon was \\"George Lucas canon\\": Episodes I‚ÄìVI (the released films at that time) overrode the lower levels of canonicity, even when referencing elements introduced in other media. In the words of Leland Chee: \\"George's view of the universe is his view. He's not beholden to what's gone before.\\" *T-canon was Television canon: The canonicity level comprising The Clone Wars, which Lucas co-created. *' was Continuity canon: Most of the material from the Expanded Universe including books, comics, and video games. The creation of stories that introduced radical changes in the continuity, like The Force Unleashed video game (which introduced Darth Vader's secret apprentice), required Lucas's approval, and he spent hours explaining the character relationships to the developers. *S-canon was Secondary canon: Any element introduced in Continuity canon that was contradicted by other material. The Holiday Special is an example, except for elements referenced in higher levels of canon. *D-canon was Detours canon: Elements of the unreleased show Detours, though primarily intended as a parody of the franchise, were to follow a serial storyline that existed in a low level of canonicity. *N-canon was Non-canon: \\"What if\\" stories (such as the first 20 issues of the Star Wars Tales comic anthology), crossover appearances (such as Star Wars character appearances in Soulcalibur IV), game statistics, and anything else directly contradicted by higher levels of canon. Lucas Licensing's managing editor Sue Rostoni said in 2001, \\"Our goal is to present a continuous and unified history of the Star Wars galaxy, insofar as that history does not conflict with, or undermine the meaning of Mr. Lucas's Star Wars saga of films and screenplays.\\" Director of Fan Relations Steve Sansweet clarified: In August 2005, Lucas said of the Expanded Universe: =2012‚Äì2014: Disney acquisition and canon restructuring= Since April 2014, the Legends label has been featured on reprints of Expanded Universe works that fall outside the Star Wars franchise canon. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for (equivalent to about $B in ). Subsequently, Lucasfilm formed the \\"Lucasfilm Story Group\\", which was established to keep track of and define the canon and unify the films, comics, and other media. Among its members are Chee, Kiri Hart, and Pablo Hidalgo. To prevent the planned sequel trilogy from being beholden to and restrained by the plotlines of the Expanded Universe works, the choice was made to discard that continuity. In particular, Chee said the death of Chewbacca in Vector Prime was a key factor in the decision. On April 25, 2014, Lucasfilm rebranded the Expanded Universe material as Star Wars Legends and declared it non-canonical to the franchise. Chee said in a 2014 Twitter post that a \\"primary goal\\" of the Story Group would be to replace the previous hierarchical canon (of the Holocron) with one cohesive one. The company's focus would be shifted towards a restructured Star Wars canon based on new material. 2014‚Äì2020: Sequel trilogy and anthology films Lucasfilm explained that the only preexisting works to be considered canonical within the franchise would be the primary episodic films and the 2008 The Clone Wars film and TV series. The announcement called these works \\"the immovable objects of Star Wars history, the characters and events to which all other tales must align.\\" It was also made clear that a planned Star Wars sequel trilogy, and subsequent works developed within the restructured canon, would not be based on Legends material but could possibly draw from it. The first new canonical novel was A New Dawn by John Jackson Miller, published in September 2014, acting as a prologue to the CGI-animated television series Star Wars Rebels, which was released a month later. Marvel began publishing new Star Wars comic book series in January 2015, and the Journey to Star Wars publishing initiative included books and comics tying in to the sequel trilogy films. The first sequel trilogy film, The Force Awakens, was released in December 2015. There was some minor fan backlash against the restructured canon, with one group successfully campaigning to buy a billboard pleading for Lucasfilm to continue the original non-canonical Expanded Universe separately from the canon. Rebels supervising director Dave Filoni reintroduced popular Legends character Thrawn into the canon in the 2016 third season of Rebels. Timothy Zahn was hired to write new canonical novels about the character. Since co- creating The Clone Wars, Filoni has followed Lucas (who incorporated Expanded Universe elements into the Special Editions, prequels, and The Clone Wars) in incorporating multiple spin-off elements into his series. Some cancelled The Clone Wars episodes were adapted into canon books and comics in The Clone Wars Legacy multimedia project. After The Force Awakens, multiple films have been released, including spin-offs Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story, (2018); as well as the second sequel trilogy film, The Last Jedi (2017), and the third, The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The new expanded universe has continued to grow since then, including dozens of novels; comics from Marvel and IDW; and new games like Battlefront II. In addition, multiple new series have been announced, including Resistance, an anime-inspired television series which premiered in fall 2018; The Mandalorian, a post-Return of the Jedi live- action series written by Jon Favreau which premiered in late 2019 on the Disney streaming service Disney+; and a final season of The Clone Wars animated series, which is also featured on the streaming service. 2020‚Äìpresent: The High Republic In February 2020, it was announced that a new line of books and comics, labeled The High Republic, would begin publishing starting in August. The line takes place 200 years prior to the events of The Phantom Menace and will not overlap any films or series currently planned for production.

Bassey, \\"What Is Africana Critical Theory or Black Existential Philosophy?\\" July 2007 vol. 37 no. 6 914-935. Although it shares a word with existentialism and that philosophy's concerns with existence and meaning in life, it \\"is predicated on the liberation of all black people in the world from oppression\\". It may also be seen as method, which allows one to read works by African-American writers such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison in an existentialist frame. Lewis Gordon argues that black existentialism is not only existential philosophy produced by black philosophers but is also thought that addresses the intersection of problems of existence in black contexts. Black existential philosophy Black existential philosophy is a subset of Africana philosophy and black philosophical thought. Africana philosophy is a form of philosophy emerging out of the critical thought of the African diaspora. Black philosophical thought pertains to the ideas emerging from black-designated peoples. Such people include, for example, Australian Aboriginal people, who often refer to themselves as \\"black.\\" There is thus also work in black existential philosophy from Australia, such as those organized through forums and articles by Danielle Davis in the Oodgeroo Unit of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. The first African American to earn a doctorate from Harvard University earned his degree in sociology, however the work of W. E. B. Du Bois has been honored in the canon of African-American philosophy. Du Bois' notion of double consciousness has been revisited by many scholars as a notion doused in existentialism. Du Bois addressed several problems germane to black existential philosophy. He raised the question of black suffering as a philosophical problem. Was there meaning behind such suffering? He also observed that black people were often studied and addressed in public discussions as problems of the modern world instead of as people facing problems raised by modern life. Black people, he argued, often faced double standards in their efforts to achieve equality in the wake of enslavement, colonialism, and racial apartheid. This double standard led, he argued, to \\"twoness\\" and \\"double consciousness.\\" The twoness was the experience of being \\"black\\" and \\"American,\\" where the two were treated as contradictory. Double consciousness followed in two forms. The first was of the experience of being seen from the perspective of white supremacy and anti-black racism. It was from the perspective of seeing themselves as lowly and inferior. The second, however, as Paget Henry argues, involves seeing the contradictions of a system that in effect blames the victim. That form of double consciousness involves seeing the injustice of a social system that limits possibilities for some groups and creates advantages for others while expecting both to perform equally. That black people were imprisoned for challenging the injustices of a social system born on the memorable phrase, \\"All men are created equal...,\\" is a case in point, and the subsequent criticism of whether \\"men\\" meant \\"women too\\" pushes this point further, as Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia Cooper, and other earlier 19th-century black critical thinkers contended. Du Bois also theorized the importance of black music, especially the spirituals, and through them raised the question of the inner-life of black people, which he referred to as their \\"soul,\\" which in his discussion of double consciousness became \\"souls\\".See, for example, the work of Terence Johnson, such as \\"'My Soul Wants Something New': Reclaiming the Souls Behind the Veil of Blackness,\\" in Jason R. Young and Edward J. Blum (eds), The Souls of W.E.B. Du Bois: New Essays and Reflections, Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 2009, pp. 110‚Äì133. Du Bois also raised the problem of history in the study of black existence. He noticed that double standards affected how history is told, and that the misrepresentation of history as an apology for white supremacy and colonialism led to the degradation of black people as passive objects of history instead of makers of history. This occlusion depended on denying the struggles for freedom waged by black people in the effort to expand the reach of freedom in the modern world. A danger of black suffering is that it could lead to a sense of pointlessness of black existence and a lack of self-worth. Cornel West has addressed the problem of Black Nihilism and its effect on the African-American community. > The proper starting point for the crucial debate about the prospects for > black America is an examination of the nihilism that increasingly pervades > black communities. Nihilism is to be understood here not as a philosophic > doctrine that there are no rational grounds for legitimate standards or > authority; it is, far more, the lived experience of coping with a life of > horrifying meaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness. > The frightening result is a numbing detachment from others and a self- > destructive disposition toward the world. Life without meaning, hope, and > love breeds a coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the > individual and others. Black suffering is also examined by the Martinican philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925‚Äì1961). In his book Black Skin, White Masks (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1952), he argued that the modern world afforded no model of a normal black adult. Instead, there are the pathologies of the black soul, which he calls a white construction. This problem placed black people in an alienated relationship with language, love, and even their inner dream life. Although he was careful to claim that there are exceptions to these claims, the general situation is as follows. Blacks who master the dominant language are treated either as not really black or receive much suspicion. Worse, they find themselves seeking white recognition, which affirms the role of whites as the standard by which they are judged. The matter repeats itself with love. Black women and black men seeking white recognition do so, he argued, through asking for recognition from white male symbols of authority. That effort is self-deceiving. It makes such black women ask to be loved as white instead of as women, and it makes such black males fail to be men. Fanon also brings out the philosophical problem of reason and its relation to emotions by considering whether a flight into N√©gritude, the intellectual movement coined by Aim√© C√©saire, could enable blacks to love themselves by rejecting white reason. But Jean-Paul Sartre's criticism in his essay \\"Orph√©e Noir\\" (\\"Black Orpheus\\") led Fanon into \\"changing his tune\\" by realizing that such a path was still relative to a white one and faced being overcome in expectations of a \\"universal\\" humanity, which for Sartre was a revolutionary working class. Fanon's response was that he needed not to know that, and later on in A Dying Colonialism (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1959), he pointed out that although whites created the Negro, it was the Negro who created N√©gritude. His point was that it was still an act of agency, and that theme of being what he called \\"actional\\" continued in his writings. At the end of Black Skin, White Masks, he asked his body to make of him a man who questions. Fanon's point was that racism and colonialism attempted to over- determine black existence, but as a question, black existence faced possibility and could thus reach beyond what is imposed upon it. In The Wretched of the Earth (Grove Press, 1963; original French 1961), he returned to this question at the historical level by demanding the transformation of material circumstances and the development of new symbols with which to set afoot a new humanity. Black existential philosophical thought was also influential in the South African anti-apartheid movement through the thought of Steve Bantu Biko. In I Write What I Like, Biko continues Fanon's project of thinking through alternative conceptions of humanity and offers his theory of Black Consciousness. Black consciousness applies to anyone who is involved in anti-racist struggle and is marked as the enemy of an anti-black, racist state. Thus for Biko, all people of color‚Äîindigenous Africans, Asians, mixed peoples, and whites who are \\"blackened\\" by their allegiance to anti-racism‚Äîare black. Biko presents here a political view of identity that resists a prior essence of black identity. One becomes black, reminiscent of Simone de Beauvoir's observation that one becomes a woman. South African philosophers influenced by Biko's existentialism include No√´l Chabani Manganyi. The influence of Biko's thought is also discussed in Andile, Mngxitama, Amanda Alexander, and Nigel Gibson (eds), Biko Lives!: Contesting the Legacies of Steve Biko (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008). Black existential philosophy came to the academy in the 1970s in the work of William R. Jones, who argued for a humanistic response to black suffering through facing the absurd as found in the thought of Albert Camus and dealing with the contradictions of theological beliefs pointed out by Jean-Paul Sartre. Jones drew upon existential philosophy to reject non-verifiable claims posed by black theology, where history is presented as God trying to liberate black people. Historical evidence, Jones suggests, says otherwise. Instead of relying on God, black people should take their lives and history into their own hands and build a better future for human kind. This is not to say that Jones took the position that blacks who believe in God should not love God. His point is that they should not rely on God for the elimination of injustice on earth. A philosopher heavily influenced by Du Bois, Fanon, and Jones is Lewis Gordon, who argues that black existential philosophy \\"is marked by a centering of what is often known as the 'situation' of questioning or inquiry itself. Another term for situation is the lived- or meaning-context of concern. Implicit in the existential demand for recognizing the situation or lived-context of Africana people's being-in-the-world is the question of value raised by people who live that situation. A slave's situation can only be understood, for instance, through recognizing the fact that a slave experiences it. It is to regard the slave as a value-laden perspective in the world\\".Existence in Black, Routledge, 1997, pp. 3‚Äì4. Gordon later argues in Existentia Africana that such a concern leads to a focus in black existential philosophy on problems of philosophical anthropology, liberation, and critical reflection on the justification of thought itself. The first asks the question, What is a human being? The second asks how can one become free. And the third is critical even of the methods used to justify the first two. Gordon argues that these questions make sense because enslaved, colonized, and dehumanized people are forced to question their humanity. That leads to questioning the meaning of being human. He argues that concerns with liberation make sense for people who have been enslaved, colonized, and racially oppressed. Because these questions are posed as objects of inquiry and demand the transformation of consciousness such as the transition from Du Bois's first form of double consciousness to the second, critical one, Gordon advocates a black existential phenomenological approach, which he sometimes call a postcolonial phenomenology or a decolonial one. A philosopher influenced by Gordon is Nelson Maldonado-Torres, whose Against War (Duke University Press, 2008) offers a \\"decolonial reduction\\" of the forms of knowledge used to rationalize slavery, colonialism, and racism. Drawing upon ideas from Aim√© C√©saire, the Lithuanian Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, Frantz Fanon, and the Argentinian philosopher Enrique Dussel, Maldonado-Torres calls the practices of dehumanization in the modern world \\"Hitlerism\\" and advocates the \\"decolonial sciences\\" (race and ethnic studies, Africana studies, women's studies) as critical forms of knowledge to articulate the humanistic project demanded by Fanon. There is also the growing area of black feminist existential philosophy. Foundations of this area of thought are in the 19th- century and early 20th-century thought of Anna Julia Cooper, who explored problems of human worth through challenging the double standards imposed upon black populations in general and black women in particular. She argued, in response to the racist claims of black worthlessness (that the world would be better off without black people), that the measure of worth should be based on the difference between contribution and investment. Since very little was actually invested in black people but so much was produced by them, she argued that black worth exceeds that of many whites. She used the same argument to defend the worth of black women. More recently in the academy, black feminist existential philosophy is taken up by Kathryn Gines, founder of the Collegium of Black Feminist Philosophers. Gines's work brings together ideas from Cooper, Sartre, Fanon, Hannah Arendt, bell hooks, and recent work in Africana phenomenology and black popular culture in such articles as: \\"Sex and Sexuality in Contemporary Hip-Hop\\" in Derrick Darby and Tommie Shelby (eds), Hip Hop and Philosophy: Rhyme 2 Reason‚ÄîA Series in Pop Culture and Philosophy (Chicago: Open Court, 2005), and \\"The Black Atlantic, Afrocentricity, and Existential Phenomenology: Theoretical Tools for Black European Studies,\\" Black European Studies, on line at Synlabor.de. Black existential literature Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, the archetype of black existentialist literature, is one of the most revered and reviewed novels written by an African-American writer. It presents examples of absurdism, anxiety and alienation in relation to the experience of the black male in mid-1900s America. The namelessness of the main character of the novel, a figure based on Ellison's own life, points to the trauma of black people receiving names that were forced on them from the violence of slavery. That renaming was meant to inaugurate a loss of memory, and that process of dismemberment is explored in the novel as the protagonist moves from one abusive father figure to another‚Äîwhite and black‚Äîto a culminating reflection on living as an invisible leech off of the system that produces light. In Ellison's novel, the only black characters who seemed somewhat free were those designated insane, as in the famous scene at the Golden Day bar where a group from an insane asylum became the critical voice early in the novel. The African-American writer who was the closest to the Sartrean existentialist movement was Richard Wright, although Wright saw himself as working through the thought of S√∏ren Kierkegaard with a focus on themes of dread and despair, especially in his novel The Outsider. Dismayed with his experience of American racism in the south, Wright sought refuge in a Parisian life. In France, he was heavily influenced by Les Temps modernes members Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty. The existential novels that he wrote after leaving the United States, such as The Outsider, never received the high critical acclaim of Native Son. In his famous introduction to Native Son, Wright made concrete some of the themes raised by Du Bois. He pointed to the injustice of a system in which police officers randomly arrested young black men for crimes they did not commit and prosecutors who were able to secure convictions in such cases. He also argued that Bigger Thomas, the anti-hero of the novel, was produced by such a system and is often envied by many as a form of resistance to it. Wright's insight portended the emergence, for example, of the contemporary black \\"gangsta,\\" as portrayed in gangsta rap. In retrospect, James Baldwin has been considered by others as a Black existentialist writer; however he was quite critical of Richard Wright and suspicious of his relationship with French intellectuals. Baldwin also brought questions of interracial and bisexual relationships into consideration and looked at the question of suffering as a struggle to defend the possibility of genuine human relationships in his novel Another Country. The writings of Toni Morrison are also contributions to black existentialism. Her 1970 novel The Bluest Eye examines how \\"ugliness\\" and \\"beauty\\" dominate black women's lives as imitations of white women as the standard of beauty. Her famous novel Beloved (1987) raises the question of the trauma that haunts black existence from slavery.See, for example, the discussion of that novel in Marilyn Nissim- Sabat, Neither Victim Nor Survivor, Lanham: Lexington Books, 2009, chapter 8.

Divided among various independent religious congregations following the same spirit and tradition, they serve around the world. Since 1903 they have used the postnominal initials of R.E.J.. History Foundation Martel, the daughter of a local magistrate, had grown up in affluence and comfort. A deeply spiritual young woman, she desired to find a path in life in keeping with her religious beliefs. After a period of consultation with her spiritual director, the Abb√© Louis Trond of the Society of Saint-Sulpice, she undertook the practical expression of her faith by caring for women and instructing them in the faith at a small hospital for destitute women. She was soon asked to teach catechism to the children of the city who were living on the street. Her example and reputation led other young women to join her in this ministry to the needy. The mission expanded to reach out to the lace-makers working in the factories. By 1669 the number of women sharing this vision had grown to the point that their work had spread throughout the city and into the surrounding villages, and they had begun to live in the community. Martel died in 1673, at the age of 28, without seeing the formalization of her work into a religious congregation. (The cause for her canonization was accepted for study by the Holy See in 2005.) The society of instructors she had founded did not achieve the status of a religious community within the Church until 1676, when under the guidance of a canon of Rheims, John Baptist de la Salle, whom they met after their establishment of a convent there, they received the official approval of Armand de B√©thune, the Bishop of Le Puy, as the \\"Ladies and Girls of Instruction\\". After the group underwent a formal period of novitiate, they professed a public vow of chastity in 1678. With the exception of the community at Versailles, founded in 1680, most of the various communities, previously independent, merged into the Congregation of the Sisters of the Child Jesus in 1708, and received their first common Rule of Life in 1760. Dispersal and re-establishment The work of the congregation was ended with the French Revolution and the Sisters of the congregation were scattered. This situation did not last long, however, as a new community of Instructors was formed in Le Puy by Mademoiselle de Senicrose. Soon after that, in 1804, Marie Maisonobe opened a school in Aurillac following the format of the congregation. By 1812 the Catholic Church had re-established itself sufficiently that she was able to begin her formal formation in Puy-en-Velay. This developed into an autonomous congregation in 1843, whose first Superior General was Louise Maisonobe, niece of Marie. This congregation later merged with the Sisters of Providence of Rodez in 1856. They later opened schools in Argentina (1888) and in Belgium in 1903. Through the work of different foundresses in other cities of France, other autonomous congregations came to develop: Digne (1840), Claveisolles (1858), and Chauffailles (1859). Mission to Canada In 1896 the congregation accepted the request of Pierre-Paul Durieu, O.M.I., the first Bishop of New Westminster in British Columbia, to work with the people of the First Nations. Four Sisters of the congregation, under the leadership of Mother Aim√©e, left Le Puy and traveled to Canada, arriving in Williams Lake. From this time the congregation has taught in various schools and built schools and foundations across western Canada, eventually serving in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Reunion After the reorganizations required by the various congregations of the Sisters of the Child Jesus around France about 1920, the desire to re- join developed, in order to better answer the needs of the Sisters' ministries. In 1949 the congregation based in Versailles merged with another that was based in Le Puy. In 1952, the congregations of Le Puy and Aurillac merged to form a single congregation. Current status The congregation based in Le Puy has Sisters serving in Argentina, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, France, Ivory Coast, and Vietnam. They served in Liberia from 1966 to 1992. The congregation based in Chauffailles remains autonomous and currently has houses in France, Canada, Cambodia (since 2002), and Japan.

Football in Peru was introduced by British immigrants, Peruvians returning from Great Britain, and by English sailors in the later half of the 19th century during their frequent stops at the port of Callao, which at that point was considered one of the most important ports of the Pacific Ocean. According to the work entitled La Difusion del Futbol en Lima, during the last decade of the 19th century, records show that sailors were known to practice sports such as football and played against teams made up of Englishmen, Peruvians, or a mix between Englishmen and Peruvians. Introduction of football in Peru (19th century) Lima is home to an important sporting institution, it was founded in 1845 by English immigrants as Salon de Comercio, renamed in 1859 as the Lima Cricket Club, and was based around the sports of cricket, rugby, and football, the club underwent many other name changes such as in 1865 to Lima Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club and in 1906 to Lima Cricket and Football Club. During the War of the Pacific (1879 - 1883), the destruction of various Peruvian towns and cities, including the raid of Lima, brought the spread of sport in Peru to a momentary stop. The oldest football records are found for a Callao vs. Lima match on August 7, 1892, and an Englishmen vs. Peruvian match on June 24, 1894. Amateur era (Early 20th century) After the war, the sports rivalry that evolved between the foreigners and the Chalacos began to gain much attention from people elsewhere. As a result, the popularity of the sport eventually extended to Lima, and even though at first the sport was played without the formality of sports clubs, a few clubs were eventually created in order to continue its practice in the early 20th century. Among these early clubs of the amateur era were the English community's Lima Cricket Club founded in 1859 although it is unclear when they first played football, their oldest recorded match having been played on August 7, 1892. They were followed by the Peruvian Ciclista Lima Association (Lima, 1896), and Atl√©tico Chalaco (Callao, 1899). In the 1900s, due to the construction of the Panama Canal, the port of Callao was no longer flooded with the quantity of foreign sailors and travelers that had at one point made the port a point of much cultural diffusion. Nonetheless, by this moment more Peruvian cities had developed their own football clubs and leagues, the most important being those of Lima, Cusco, and Arequipa. Some of the most important new clubs founded at this time were Alianza Lima (Lima, 1901), Cienciano (Cusco, 1901), FBC Melgar (Arequipa, 1915), the Italian community's Circolo Sportivo Italiano (Lima, 1917), Atl√©tico Grau (Piura, 1919), Alianza Atletico (Sullana, 1920), Universitario de Deportes (Lima, 1924), Sport Boys (Callao, 1927), and Coronel Bolognesi (Tacna, 1929). As such, the sport rapidly grew in Peru, but the most important amateur league (the Peruvian Football League) stayed in the capital province where a new football rivalry arose between the participating clubs of Lima and the clubs of Callao. Yet, the lack of a central organization often brought much conflict between the teams, and such a situation eventually escalated into a conflict that led to the creation of the Peruvian Football Federation in 1922 and a new Peruvian Football League tournament under the regulation of said organization in 1926. Professional era and regional recognition (1920s to 1930s) Even though the Peruvian Football Federation had joined CONMEBOL in 1925, the re-structuring of the national league prevented the creation of a national football team that would be able to participate in the South American Championships of 1925 and 1926. Moreover, even though in the club level Peru had a series of strong teams, the Peru national team for the 1929 South American Championship was the first successful attempt at a Peru national team. Their first game played against Uruguay (recent winners of the Football Olympics), showed a largely disunited team still trying to mold into a team. The disunity could largely be blamed on class conflict and racial discrimination. The first fielded team was built largely of players from Alianza Lima and Universitario de Deportes, the former being composed of working class men and the later of white university students. Alianza players felt more loyal to their local team than to the national team, and when it became clear that they were being segregated from the rest of the team and left out of the starting IX, they resigned from the national team before play at the South American Cup; they lost every match. The Football Federation approached the Alianza players again, and offered them reinstatement. Alianza agreed to the federation's terms, and played in the 1930 World Cup. The time that followed saw the appearance of a group of excellent Peruvian football players that would help further expand the popularity of the sport not only in Peru, but also in other countries of South America. During the 1920s and 1930s, Peruvian clubs made a series of international tours across South America due to the high demand of the skill of their players in places such as Colombia, Venezuela, and in Chile. Peru's art of skill and technique of association football was felt and given a highly positive look in these many countries. In Colombia, the appearance of Ciclista Lima Association allegedly made the Colombian crowds \\"vibrate with excitement\\" as they anticipated much skill from the Peruvian squad. In 1928, the Peruvian club Atl√©tico Chalaco made a tour in Chile and defeated seven Chilean teams they faced and only lost to Colo-Colo. In 1933 Alianza Lima made a tour in Chile and, with Peruvians such as Teodoro Fernandez and Alejandro Villanueva, delighted the audiences with their skill and defeated a series of important Chilean clubs of that time such as Club Deportivo Magallanes, Santiago Wanderers, Audax Italiano, and Colo-Colo. In Peru, Alejandro Villanueva is often remembered as one of the finest exponents of that nation's association football and as the player that amazed the crowds with his bicycle kicks which the people of Lima at first thought was his invention when he executed it in 1928 and it was called \\"tiro caracol\\" and, later, upon learning of its roots in Callao, once again called chalaca. In 1930, they were invited to participate in a new intercontinental competition to be held in Montevideo, Uruguay, the first FIFA World Cup. Romanian goalkeeper against the Peruvian striker Lores during the 1930 FIFA World Cup. The 1930 FIFA World Cup was an interesting experience for all the teams participating. For the Peruvian team, their first match against the Romania national football team was filled with problems as the Romanians and Peruvians played a rough match that eventually led to a broken leg for one of the Romanian players. This and several other incidents on the field, such as the first-minute goal by Romania, soon led to the World Cup's first player dismissed, the Peruvian Pl√°cido Galindo. After all the commotion was settled due to this decision by the referee, Peru was able to momentarily tie the game. Nevertheless, the lack of a player and the inexperience of the national side gave (after two consecutive goals) a pleasing 3-1 result to Romania. Afterwards, in the match against the hosts, Uruguay, that would inaugurate the Estadio Centenario, Peru played an allegedly formidable game against the Charruas. In fact, Peru lost only by one goal to Uruguay, thus showing a sign of improvement from the past 1929 result against Uruguay (whom would later go on to beat Romania 4-0 and eventually beat Argentina to crown themselves champions of the tournament). Juan Valdivieso, goalkeeper of the Peru national football team, reaches out for the football during the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics match between Austria and Peru. Later, during 1936 Berlin Olympics, the team further showed how much they had improved since 1929. Largely with the squad of the 1930s, but with a new group of young stars, Peru made a great start by defeating the Finland national football team with a margin of 7-3. Even more surprisingly, the Peruvians defied all odds and managed to defeat Austria on a 4-2 result during over-time. Still, the team formally withdrew due to problems with the German government's intervention causing the International Olympic Committee to nullify Peru's victory against Austria and ordering a re-match. Even though the team was already making history, their perseverance would soon lead them to the consolidation of their grandeur. In 1938, Peru's first international title would finally come during the first Bolivarian Games, which Peru won after winning all their games against the football teams of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Then, further consolidating their status as Peru's first golden generation, the national squad won Peru's first South American Championship (later known as Copa Am√©rica) in 1939. Once again, the national squad lost none of its matches and in their path to the finals defeated Ecuador, Chile, and Paraguay. For the final, Peru had to yet again face Uruguay, but this time the team was able to overcome the challenge and defeated Uruguay by a close margin of 2-1. Peruvian player Teodoro Fern√°ndez became the tournament's maximum goal scorer with 7 goals, and currently retains the historic second place of the competition. As a result of these many titles, victories, and important showings, the early years of Peru's football history went extraordinarily well, and the team was able to effectively build its game along with the increasing competition of the CONMEBOL region. Decline and rise (1940s-1960s) Nonetheless, due to a series of internal problems, Peru's football years after this first golden generation did not involve any other major accomplishments. The 1940s and 1950s flew by with only the achievements of a gold and bronze medal at the Bolivarian Games, and a couple of third places in the Copa Am√©rica. During the 1960s Peru began to slowly show signs of improvement as the team won the Bolivarian Games of Barranquilla and qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome. Even though the team was only capable of beating the India national football team after losing to France and Hungary, the squad once again began to give its fans bright hopes for the future. 1970s Golden Generation (1970s to 1980s) Once into the 1970s, the Peruvian \\"Blanquirrojas\\" rose with a spark of international victories and a string of young football stars that made the team once more a major competitive force in the world of football. Players like Te√≥filo Cubillas, Pedro Pablo Leon, H√©ctor Chumpitaz, Ramon Mifflin, Hugo Sotil, Roberto Challe, and C√©sar Cueto, helped make South American football a fierce competitor of European football at a time when teams throughout the world were becoming better at this sport. The participations of Peru in the 1970, 1978, and 1982 FIFA World Cups made the national team once again leave its mark in international competitions as the world saw with awe the elegant and technical play of a Peruvian squad that had a thirst for victory. The participation of Peru in the 1970 FIFA World Cup remains as one of the most memorable as the squad caused sensation as they advanced into the quarterfinals after first eliminating Argentina in the qualifiers, defeating Bulgaria 3-2 after trailing 0-2, losing 3-1 to Germany, and defeating Morocco 3-0. Moreover, their game against Brazil, which they lost 4-2, is usually considered as one of the best World Cup games to have ever been played. Not only that, but in 1975 Peru achieved its second Copa Am√©rica title, and thus another set of players consolidated their mark in Peruvian sports history. Furthermore, the Peruvian squad once more took the title of football champions at the Bolivarian Games twice during these times. Along with an increase of better teams within the Peruvian league, Peru kept up its game up well into the late 1980s. Modern history (1990s to present) Heading towards the 21st century, the 1990s were not very good years for the Peruvian football team. The terrible 1987 Alianza Lima air disaster further crushed the hopes for the team as a series of good players ready to play for the national team died. Although there were still several good players like Julio C√©sar Uribe, Nolberto Solano, Claudio Pizarro, and Jos√© del Solar, the team was no longer the \\"Golden Team\\" of the 70s. In terms of Copa Am√©rica, the squad could only go as far as the quarterfinals before getting eliminated. Meanwhile, in the World Cup qualifiers, the team was not able to even get close to reaching another FIFA tournament until 1998, but that dream was also thwarted by a goal difference with Chile. The only important title the team won during these years was the Kirin Cup, where they shared first place with Belgium. The early 21st century brought with it the same Peruvian team, a shadow of its former self. Nevertheless, the squad began getting new revivals once the team began getting new young players with new hopes and goals. As the years kept going, Peruvian football once more started to give signs of vitality as local teams from the league began doing rather well in international competitions. Yet, the results were still vastly the same for the Peruvian team in terms of both the Copa Am√©rica and the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. Quite surprisingly, Peru was able to do well when they were invited to participate in the CONCACAF Gold Cup and even won another Kirin Cup in 2005. Meanwhile, in 2007, the football fans of Peru received another great surprise as the national U-17 squad qualified and reached the quarterfinals (for their first time) of their FIFA World Cup. With young star players like Jefferson Farf√°n and Jos√© Paolo Guerrero had given new hopes to fans that things would turn around for the better. Nonetheless the possibilities of Peru securing a CONMEBOL place for the 2010 FIFA World Cup have completely vanished since the team has tumbled to the bottom of the qualification table. Nolberto Solano: Peru Are Eliminated From The World Cup In 2011 Peru won the Kirin Cup tournament, and earned third place in the 2011 Copa Am√©rica. In early 2015, businessman Edwin Oviedo became FPF president, succeeding Burga, whom two years later faced charges of racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering in a football corruption trial in the United States. The FPF's new leadership appointed Ricardo Gareca as Peru's manager in March 2015. After coaching the national team to a third place in the 2015 Copa Am√©rica and to the quarterfinals of the Copa Am√©rica Centenario, Gareca qualified Peru for the Russia 2018 World Cup finals. Other teams Outside its senior side, Peru also has the Olympic/U-23, U-20 and U-17 teams. A women's team also competes in other South American competitions. In spite of its rich men's senior records, its youth teams have been mostly the lackluster of CONMEBOL competitions. The Olympic side of Peru has not qualified for the Summer Olympics since it became an U-23 competition in 1992. The U-20 team has competed in every South American Youth Football Championship but it has never qualified for any FIFA U-20 World Cup. Meanwhile, Peru has only managed to qualify for only one FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007, outside being host of the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The women's team has never reached FIFA Women's World Cup, and has mainly competed in the Copa Am√©rica Femenina.

Public Safety Commissioner dismissal Governor Palin's Chief of Staff, Mike Nizich dismissed Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan on July 11, 2008 for the reason (according to Palin's spokesperson Sharon Leighow) that \\"the governor wanted to take DPS in a different direction\\" Nizich then offered Monegan the job as director of the ABC Board which he turned down. Anchorage blogger Andrew Halcro broke the story that Monegan was fired a week later after his refusal to fire Palin's ex-brother-in-law, a state trooper. Halcro was a two-term state representative and ran against Palin for governor in 2006, joining in the debates, finishing third with 9.47% of the votes, after Palin (48.33%) and former Governor Tony Knowles (40.97%). Monegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from the Governor, her husband, and her staff, including State Attorney General Talis Colberg, to fire Palin's ex-brother-in-law, state trooper Mike Wooten; Wooten was involved in a child custody battle with Palin's sister that included an alleged death threat against Palin's father. Monegan stated he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated, and Wooten had been disciplined for the others three years prior. He told the Palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed and Trooper Wooten had already been disciplined. When contacted by the press for comment, Monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire Wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue; but as the governor's story changed, he came to believe that the dispute over Wooten was a major reason for his firing. Subsequent to Palin's VP pick, the McCain campaign claimed Monegan was fired for insubordination and called him a \\"rogue\\" but gave no explanation why Monegan had been offered the job of Director of the ABC Board if that were the case. Finding of investigations On October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without officially endorsing,Spence, Hal. \\"Branchflower report draws mixed reactions\\", Peninsula Clarion (2008-10-12): \\"The council voted unanimously to make the report public, but did not vote to endorse its findings.\\" the Branchflower Report in which Stephen Branchflower found that \\"Governor Sarah Palin abused her power as Governor ... [and] Walt Monegan's refusal to fire Trooper Michael Wooten ... was likely a contributing factor to his termination as Commissioner of Public Safety.\\" On 6 February 2009 the Alaska State Senate found ten Palin administration officials, together with Todd Palin, in contempt for refusing to attend hearings in the Branchflower investigation to which they had been subpoenaed. Three days later, Talis Colberg resigned his position as Attorney- General and left the State's employ. The Associated Press reported on November 3, 2008 that an independent investigation subsequently conducted by the Alaska Personnel Board cleared Governor Palin of any abuse of power. The Personnel Board's three members were first appointed by Palin's predecessor, and Palin reappointed one member in 2008. Anchorage mayoral campaign In December 2008, Monegan announced his run for Mayor of Anchorage. The Monegan for Mayor campaign was launched in January 2009.

Hodoscopes are characterized by being made up of many segments; the combination of which segments record a detection is then used to infer where the particle passed through hodoscope. The typical detector segment is a piece of scintillating material, which emits light when a particle passes through it. The scintillation light can be converted to an electrical signal either by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a PIN diode. If a segment measures some significant amount of light, the experimenter can infer that a particle passed through that segment. In addition to coordinate information, for some systems the strength of the light can be proportional to the deposited energy. By doing necessary calibrations, the deposited energy can be determined, which then can be used to infer information about the original particle's energy. As an example: a simple hodoscope might be used to determine where a particle crossed a plane or a wall. In this case, the experimenter could use two segments shaped like strips, arranged in two layers. One layer of strips could be arranged horizontally, while a second layer could be arranged vertically. A particle passing through the wall would hit a strip in each layer; the vertical strip would reveal the particle's horizontal position when it crossed the wall, while the horizontal strip would indicate the particle's vertical position. Hodoscopes are some of the simplest detectors for tracking charged particles. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the segment size. In applications where the spatial resolution is very important, hodoscopes have been superseded by other detectors such as drift chambers and time projection chambers.

Background The H·∫£i LƒÉng Forest was the location of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Base Area 101 which supported the PAVN 5th and 6th Regiments. Due to a lack of available forces in I Corps the base had not been targeted by the Marines and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Operation The operation began with a helicopter assault by the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines and the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines directly into the forest at Landing Zone Dove () and then a northeast sweep while the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines acted as a blocking force. On the morning of 11 October Company C, 1/3 Marines was hit by PAVN mortar and small arms fire and then a ground assault, which was repulsed. On the afternoon of 12 October Company C, 1/1 Marines engaged PAVN soldiers in thick jungle, several Marines were wounded and so Company C fell back and formed a perimeter to allow medevac helicopters to evacuate the wounded. Shortly after the evacuation was completed Company C was attacked on two sides by an estimated 3 PAVN companies. Company D was sent to reinforce Company C and together they succeeded in driving off the attack. The following morning the Marines claimed 40 PAVN dead were found around the perimeter, Marines losses were 8 dead and 39 wounded. CPL William T. Perkins, Jr. would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. The Marines continued their sweep finding a number of recently evacuated PAVN camps, but the PAVN avoided any further engagements with the Marines. Further north, 2 Battalions of the ARVN Airborne Division mounted Operation Lam Son 138 and on the morning of 20 October they engaged the PAVN 416th Battalion, part of the 5th Regiment, and claimed killing 197 PAVN. Medina concluded on 20 October, the 1st Marines stayed in the area and began Operation Osceola with limited results. Aftermath The operation was indecisive. The PAVN were not driven out of the H·∫£i LƒÉng Forest, but their operations were severely disrupted. Marine losses were 34 dead and 143 wounded, while the US claimed that the PAVN lost 53 killed and 3 captured and 26 weapons were recovered.http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/cgi- bin/starfetch.exe?pLZ@SCZeDhmM82Ja1i1wOiU4pqyqq7aMjeNfgGN2wk66beOy1dt4A9qMKXhlrkwWn0PJR2TdyajzLzAww3lCoD5HC.a12ap9jZNf2az@hGRD2Nqh9xliAw/1201064089.pdf The Marines and Navy Corpsmen of Charlie Company 1st Marines, are the subject of Lions of Medina, an award winning and critically acclaimed book by historian Doyle Glass.

C√©sar-Pierre Richelet, bust at Cheminon. Life Richelet was born in Cheminon. His first position was regent of the College of Vitry- le-Fran√ßois, next preceptor in Dijon. Received as an advocate in service to the Parliament of Paris, he abandoned his affairs for literature and researched the Society of Perrot d'Ablancourt and that of Petru. He strengthened his knowledge of classical languages, learned Italian and Spanish, and applied himself above all to discovering the origins of the French language. He died in Paris. Works He is the author of the first French dictionary compiled in a methodical way, published under the title of: *Dictionnaire fran√ßois, contenant les mots et les choses, plusieurs nouvelles remarques sur la langue fran√ßaise, ses expressions propres, figur√©es et burlesques, la prononciation des mots les plus difficiles, le genre des noms, le r√©gime des verbes, avec les termes les plus communs des arts et des sciences: le tout tir√© de l'usage et des bons auteurs de la langue fran√ßaise (Geneva, 1680). His caustic sense of humour earned him enemies; this first edition, of which there were several counterfeit foreign editions, contains satirical passages at the expense of notables of the day including Amelot de La Houssaye, Fureti√®re, Varillas, and others.

It can accommodate more than 1,000 detainees and consists of two locations, at Zoetermeer and Scheveningen. The Zoetermeer location is for Systematic offenders and the Scheveningen location serves as a Penitentiary Psychiatric Center, the 'open design' Limited Secured Installation and Judicial Medical Center. A special independent unit in the Scheveningen location serves as a United Nations Detention Unit (UNDU) for international offenders where they remain in pre-trial detention under the responsibility of the United Nations like suspects of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Zoetermeer location The Zoetermeer location of the Hague Penitentiary Institution was built in 1995 and is located in the Rokkenhage district in Zoetermeer, a city in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The penal institution in Zoetermeer is a detention center and an Institution for Systematic offenders (ISD). The device has capacity for nearly 400 detainees.

More than 25,000 passed through the prison, the vast majority being Jews, resistance fighters, and political prisoners. Most went on to Germans prisons and concentration camps. 215 prisoners were executed at the Waalsdorpervlakte, the dunes opposite the prison. The complex became a prison again after the liberation, however cell 601, one of the cells for people condemned to death, remained in authentic condition.

History The Saar region was formed by the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I. It was decided that the area belonged to Germany, but would be administered by France on behalf of the League of Nations. On 28 July 1920, it was decided that the area would use a blue, white, and black horizontal tricolour flag. This was used until 1 March 1935, when the area again came under German administration. In 1935, when Germany once again assumed control of the Saarland, it is assumed no new flag was created since the Saarland was absorbed into the area known as Westmark. At the conclusion of World War II, the French assumed control of the Saar as a protectorate. The flag used at this time was a design with a Scandinavian cross. Left of the vertical bar of the cross was blue, and to the right was red. The colors are derived from the colors of the French flag. When the Saar protectorate rejoined the Federal Republic of Germany, in 1957 it adopted its current flag. This is based on the flag of Germany, defaced by the Coat of arms of Saarland.

Interpretation The poet conceives us as evolving and increasingly civilized products of an earthly process. Indeed the earth itself is growing and growing old, while we sport our complex bodies and venture ever more sophisticated desires. Human experience is a kind of illusion engendered by our evolved sense organs, vulnerable to \\"the mother's death\\" and the cold death of the universe. The spirit sees this and is aggrieved, for it would harbor experience in some place that transcends nature, free from the contingencies of earth and universe. The poem can be read as ironic, as calling into question the pretension of 'the spirit'.

This effect can be advantageous under certain circumstances, but if it is not a wanted feature, it should be well taken into account. Since shrinkage is more pronounced the first time the rope becomes wet, new rope is usually immersed into water and put to dry before use so that the shrinkage is less than it would be if the rope had never been wet. A major disadvantage in this shrinkage is that many knots made with manila rope became harder and more difficult to untie when wet, thus becoming subject of increased stress. Manila rope will rot after a period of time when exposed to saltwater. Manila hemp rope was previously the favoured variety of rope used for executions by hanging, both in the U.K. and USA.

In commerce Shouting matches should be avoided in commercial interactions between customers and suppliers because they tend to poison relations between the parties and so reduce the possibility of a productive deal. Training and role-playing may be used to develop the emotional intelligence required to handle such situations effectively. In public situations such as a nightclub or bar, staff that get into shouting matches with patrons look badly unprofessional. If they instead ignore the insults, the intoxicated customers will get frustrated and leave. Online Online communication in internet forums commonly takes the form of a shouting match, sometimes using ALL CAPS to denote shouting.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 26, 2009. In the episode, Bart and Lisa start struggling in their academic and social lives at school and Homer starts monitoring them and forcing them to do better, becoming a helicopter parent. Meanwhile, Marge discovers a sauna in the basement. This was the first episode in over eight years written by Rob LaZebnik. Plot Homer, Bart and Lisa go to the carnival on the South-Side Sea Port, and Homer indulges in various varieties of kebabs. While devouring them indiscriminately, he accidentally swallows a flaming stick. He tries to douse it out with water, but gets tricked by Bart into drinking lighter fluid (prompting Homer to strangle and breathe fire at him). Following a brief stint in a tongue cast, Homer's taste buds become hypersensitive, making eating ordinary food an ordeal. Lisa remedies the problem by giving Homer cafeteria food from Springfield Elementary, which is so bland that a supertaster like Homer can tolerate it. Homer decides to dine at the elementary school, and even goes so far as to be a cafeteria server to pay for his meals, much to the embarrassment of Bart. While dining at the school, Homer meets a \\"helicopter mom\\", who pressures her son Noah into succeeding by being near him at all times. She makes snide remarks about Homer's children, pointing out how dumb Bart is and how much of a social outcast Lisa is. Homer decides to become a \\"helicopter parent\\", fearing that his children's only ambition in life will be to serve children like Noah. Bart must build a balsa wood model to compete in a sculpture assignment, and Homer insists on helping. While shopping for balsa wood, Homer reveals that Bart will build the Washington Monument, but Principal Skinner criticizes this as overly easy. In response, Homer purchases a model kit of Westminster Abbey. He buys a book for Lisa entitled \\"Chicks with Cliques\\", and persuades her to try joining a clique, first by declaring that dolphins swim in \\"cliques\\" and that the United States was founded by a clique, and then by hosting a cellphone-decorating party for the popular girls. Homer is convinced that Bart will not build the Abbey model correctly and insists on building it himself. He works late into the night and accidentally falls asleep. During a dream sequence, ghosts of some of the historical figures Homer imagines are buried in Westminster Abbey ‚Äî Geoffrey Chaucer, Anne of Cleves, and Oscar Wilde (who is actually buried in Paris) ‚Äî advise Homer to let Bart learn from his mistakes. Homer awakes to find he has accidentally crushed the model beyond recognition. At the competition, Superintendent Chalmers notes that Bart's model is the only one that does not appear \\"too perfect\\", and thus believes that Bart's model is the only one that was not constructed with the help of a parent, but Bart declines the award, reveals that Homer did all the work and appeals to the parents to let their kids learn from their own mistakes; having had the same dream as Homer. Lisa too confesses to her father that she no longer wants to be popular, noting that it is \\"hard work being this shallow\\". Meanwhile, Marge changes the water heater in the basement and discovers a hidden sauna, keeping it to herself out of fear that Homer will invite his friends and Moe (the latter of whom‚Äîin a scene Marge imagines‚Äîdoes not bring a towel as he believed they would \\"go Scandinavian\\"). Marge visits the sauna on a regular basis and is so deeply relaxed that she does not react when Homer tells her of Bart and Lisa's problems. After Homer comes home believing he has failed as a parent, Marge leads him downstairs to the sauna where they revel in steam and relaxation. In the end, Marge douses the sauna rocks with beer and as their towels fall off the two kiss. Reception The episode received a 4.5/6 Nielsen rating and was watched by 5.94 million viewers. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said \\"Father Knows Worst\\" is a \\"middle-of-the-road\\" Simpsons episode, as \\"it lands right in the middle between the best Simpsons episodes and the worst. Even though Marge and Maggie are completely wasted, and Lisa‚Äôs storyline barely gets off the ground, seeing Homer try at anything is good for a laugh, especially if that something is parenting and includes him imagining Marge water-skiing on a stegosaurus. Not exactly a model episode, but a decent entry all the same.\\" Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode. He said, \\"The main story was entertaining, and the random jokes throughout the episode added to the quality.\\" He went on to say, \\"All in all, it's tough to complain when the story is solid and the jokes are funny.\\" In addition, Dan Castellaneta won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Homer Simpson in this episode, marking his fourth win for that award.

Various royal suitors wish to win the hand of Queen Elizabeth, including a flamboyant King Julio of Spain. The Queen rejects his advances and King Julio vows revenge on England, summoning the Spanish Armada. Meanwhile, Walter Raleigh, played by Homer, falls for Queen Elizabeth's Lady in Waiting, played by Marge. When Elizabeth catches the two making out, she sentences them to execution. They are saved at the last minute when Moe dashes in, reporting the arrival of the Spanish Armada. Homer leads an English naval offense against the Armada, defeating them by accidentally setting the lone English warship on fire, which then spreads to the entire Spanish fleet. Queen Elizabeth knights him and then proclaims, \\"I don't need a man, for I have England\\" (with Moe sarcastically quipping, \\"Yeah, you keep telling yourself that\\"). Snow White In the second tale, Lisa tells the story of Snow White, with herself in the title role. Her version features the dwarves Crabby (Moe), Drunky (Barney), Hungry (Homer), Greedy (Mr. Burns), Lenny (Lenny), Kearney (Kearney) and Doc (Julius Hibbert), following the appearance of the Blue-Haired Lawyer who tells Lisa that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has been copyrighted by the Walt Disney Corporation, prompting Lisa to change the characters to avoid being sued. When the wicked queen learns from her magic HD television that Snow White is fairer than she is, she dispatches her huntsman (Groundskeeper Willie) to murder the young maiden. However, Willie the huntsman cannot bring himself to cut out her heart (or to cut out a pig's heart or to cut a heart out of construction paper for that matter) and Snow White runs away to the forest, seeking shelter in the dwarves' cottage. She keeps house for them while they work in the mines but the wicked queen, disguised as an old woman, physically forces Snow White to eat a poisoned apple. She escapes the dwarves, only to be brutally lynched by an angry group of woodland animals. In Lisa's version, Snow White does not need a man to wake her but is brought back to life by a female doctor. Lady Macbeth In the third tale, Marge relates a story of ruthless ambition, embodied by Lady Macbeth. Marge (parodying Lady Macbeth) is frustrated with everything. Not only does she have to clean the costumes worn by the other actors, but is also criticized by the director for not doing a proper job of it. Adding to her frustrations is that Homer does not have the title role in a Springfield production of Macbeth and instead plays a tree (which he is overly pleased with as he is uninterested in auditioning for lead roles). She convinces him to murder the lead actor, Sideshow Mel. Homer follows her command and then assumes the role of Macbeth. However, his performance receives unfavorable reviews compared with the more seasoned actors and even those with no lines. After the next performance reviews, Patty and Selma points out to Marge that they agree with the reviews. They warn her that her ruthless and devious ambitions will come back to haunt her one day. Even a remorseful Homer agrees and tries in vain to convince her to have someone else be the lead role and let him go back to his original role as a tree. Furious, Marge refuses and orders a more reluctant Homer to continue his killing spree until he is the only actor left. While scrubbing the blood from the costumes, Marge fumes over Homer screwing up and making a mess in the costumes. She is visited by the angry spirits of the actors she has murdered. She tries to put the blame on her husband, but they refuse to believe her. Sideshow Mel tells Marge off that he and the other spirits knew that Homer was a victim himself in her devious plans. Lenny agrees and mentions that she should have listened to her sisters when she had the chance. Dr. Hibbert tells Marge that her ambitions in killing them in order for Homer to play the lead role, had done her in. Finally in the form of revenge for her actions, the angry spirits kill Marge by causing a fright-induced heart attack. In her memory (or rather, by her spirit force, since she apparently has not learned her lesson or anything from the experience), Homer performs a stirring soliloquy in the empty theater. Marge's ghost appears in the audience and is overjoyed by his effort. She raves that Homer has finally given a great performance for her and urges him to appear in more Shakespearean plays by tossing scripts in front of him. However much to Marge's chagrin, Homer decides to take the easy way out by killing himself so he does not have to audition any more. In his ghost form, a pleased Homer tells her off that auditioning for those plays would be a real tragedy for him and is free to be lazy. A frustrated Marge learns her lesson the hard way when she realizes that she has to spend the rest of eternity with a lazy and happy Homer. Maggie Roark In the final tale, Maggie is depicted as \\"Maggie Roark\\", representing Howard Roark from Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Maggie's architectural brilliance is squashed by an oppressive pre-school teacher (Ellsworth Toohey) who encourages only conformity. She builds several famous landmarks (such as The Taj Mahal in India and The Bird's Nest in Beijing, China) out of blocks and other toys, all of which are destroyed by Toohey (to the strains of Beethoven's 9th symphony, 2nd movement), who disapproves of the superiority of her creations over those of the other children. During a Parents' Day at Mediocri-Tots Day Care Center, Maggie dazzles everyone with her rendition of the Empire State Building and ends up on trial for expressing herself. During the trial, Maggie (voiced by Jodie Foster) defends herself by stating that the creative people of her time have never compromised their talent for the sake of others and neither will she. Years later, Maggie is shown as a successful architect who opens a daycare center dedicated to letting babies express themselves freely. Ending The rest of the story is interrupted when Marge stops Maggie from painting Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night on the nail salon wall, scolding her for \\"soiling\\" the wall and not realizing the irony. Reception This episode was watched by 5.16 million viewers. It was the second most watched show of the night on Animation Domination, on the Fox network, after Family Guy.Ratings: Four Great Women and Another All Time Low! Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club graded the episode a \\"C-\\", stating \\"[...] tonight's classically themed outing didn't fare very well, starting with the story of one of the Bouvier sisters as Queen Elizabeth‚Äîan episode segment that clocked in at just over four minutes, far too short a time to do anything lasting... or funny. The longest stretch came near the end, in the form of an extended riff on MacBeth involving Homer killing a ton of people. But aside from the occasional random line or two, it was pretty much a boring retelling of the tale, with Simpsons characters subbing in for Shakespearean ones. So I guess the question is: How much pleasure is there to milk from seeing familiar yellow people reenact parts of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead? Given the show's shaky streak lately, not nearly enough.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 6.2/10, ultimately saying \\"Four stories instead of three, but there was really one worth watching\\", \\"Snow White\\".

Officially known in Malay as (also ), it is a village subdivision under the subdistrict of Sengkurong. Jerudong is home to a few notable places of the country. It is the location of Jerudong Park, the country's sole amusement park, as well as The Empire Hotel and Country Club, a luxury hotel which is often regarded as one of the notable landmarks of Brunei. Jerudong is also home to Jerudong Park Medical Centre and Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre, the country's main specialist healthcare centres.  History   Oil exploration  There had been oil exploration attempts being conducted in Jerudong in the past. In 1914, five shallow wells were drilled but abandoned in the following year due to geological issues. Nevertheless, drilling was renewed in 1940, and subsequently in 1955, by the then British Malayan Petroleum Company, resulting in the six wells being spudded. However, the wells yielded negligible results.  Administration  Jerudong is officially a village subdivision, the third- and lowest-level administrative division of Brunei. It is a subdivision of Sengkurong, a subdistrict of Brunei-Muara. The community of Jerudong is headed by a village head; as of 2017, it is held by Mohammad Rais bin Ishak. He also oversees the settlement area of Peninjau.  Transport   Road  Jerudong is served by three highways: Muara‚ÄìTutong Highway, Jalan Jerudong and Jerudong‚ÄìTungku Highway. The Muara‚ÄìTutong Highway traverses Jerudong between its northeastern and western points, where as Jalan Jerudong passes through Jerudong in north-south direction; the latter also terminates in the area in the north at Jerudong Beach. The two roads are directly connected via an interchange. They are also indirectly connected via a road which passes through the Jerudong Park area, whereby it is connected to the Highway via an interchange and terminates at the other end at a traffic light junction of Jalan Jerudong. Meanwhile, the western end of Jerudong‚ÄìTungku Highway terminates in the east of Jerudong at another traffic light junction of Jalan Jerudong.  Economy  The economy of Jerudong is based on a mixture of retail, service and hospitality. Jerudong has a number of grocery stores, restaurants and other types of shops which mainly cater the livelihood of the residents. It also has a fish market: Jerudong Market () is located close to Jerudong Beach, whereby the fish and other marine produce sold in the market are mainly catches by the fishermen going to the sea from this beach. The Jerudong Market is one if the two largest markets in the country, supported by the Minister of Home Affairs.[https://borneobulletin.com.bn/kampong-ayer-to- get-b45-million-facelift/ Kampong Ayer to get B$45-million facelift  March 13, 2018  Hakim Hayat  Meanwhile, people who are in the service sector are mainly employed in the specialist healthcare centres, namely Jerudong Park Medical Centre and Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre, where as those in the hospitality industry are mainly employed in the few hotels located in Jerudong, as well as the leisure facilities of Jerudong Park Country Club.  Education  Education in Jerudong is available in primary level, both general and religious. Jerudong Primary School () is a government school which provides seven years of general primary education.

Recreation  Royal Golf & Country Club fountain ‚Äî Jerudong, Brunei Jerudong Park, the country's only amusement park, was opened in 1994. It used to offer free admission, which claimed to be the first amusement park in the world to do so. The park fell into disuse for several years but it was eventually revamped and relaunched in 2014. At present, Jerudong Park features several rides as well as a water park, musical fountain, food court and an indoor amphitheatre for events; the Jerudong Park Amphitheatre once hosted concerts by Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston in 1996.

Kamio was the younger son of Kamio Heizabur≈ç, a samurai retainer of the Suwa clan in Shinano province (present-day Nagano prefecture). He graduated from military academy in 1874, and served as a sergeant in the Imperial infantry during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. He rose rapidly through the ranks, to sergeant-major and then was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant by the end of the same year. His commission was confirmed as official by the end of the war, and in 1882 was promoted to full lieutenant. Kamio served in Qing dynasty China as a military attach√© from 1885-86,Seagrave, Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China during which time he was promoted to captain. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to various staff positions, and became a major in December 1891. He returned to China again as a military attach√© attached to the Japanese embassy in Beijing from 1892-1894. With the outbreak of the 1894-95 First Sino-Japanese War, he was a staff officer attached to Japanese Second Army. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel at the end of the war, and then to full colonel in 1897 when he assumed command of the 3rd Imperial Guard Regiment. Kamio was sent to Europe from February 1899 to April 1900. Subsequently he was Chief of Staff of the IJA 1st Division in 1900, and of the IJA 10th Division the following year. In May 1902, he was promoted to major general. During the Russo-Japanese War, Kamio held a series of further divisional commands: with 22nd Brigade, Japanese China Garrison Army, IJA 9th Division and IJA 18th Division, but not within front-line combat units.Duffy In December 1908, he was further promoted to lieutenant general. He was commander of the IJA 18th Division from 1912. After the start of World War I, Kamio, with a reputation for solid caution rather than brilliance, was selected to lead Allied ground forces in the seizure of Tsingtao from Germany. Kamio made lavish use of logistics and overwhelming firepower to spare bloodshed as much as possible.Denis In Summer 1914, Kamio's 18th Division of 23,000 men backed by 144 guns began a bombardment of the port on 2 September 1914. The port fell a little over two months later, Kamio's siege tactics earning him praise for the skill with which he carefully deployed artillery tactics to aid infantry advances. Kamio served thereafter as Japanese governor of Tsingtao and was promoted to full general in June 1916. A month later, he was honored with elevation to the rank of baron (danshaku) under the kazoku peerage system. He entered the reserves in August 1917, and retired completely in 1925. He died in 1927 and is buried at Z≈çshigaya cemetery.

McQueen in 1869. Photographic career Hollyer became interested in photography about 1860. He made albumen and carbon prints, but his preferred medium was the platinotype or platinum print process,Roberts, Art History Through the Camera's Lens, p. 324. admired for its permanence and great tonal range. Under the patronage of Frederic Leighton, Hollyer began to photograph paintings and drawings in the 1870s. Artists whose work he published include Edward Burne- Jones, George Frederic Watts, Simeon Solomon, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Of his work with the Pre-Raphaelites, The Times noted that Heads of Despight, Cruelty, and Dame Amoret, Burnes-Jones's study for The Masque of Cupid, from a print by Hollyer. Walter Crane, 1886 Hollyer's photographs of drawings were particularly successful; printed on high-quality paper, they were often mistaken for originals. One of the most popular was a study of three heads by Burne-Jones for The Masque of Cupid. Hollyer also took studio portraits and specialised in interior and exterior photos of houses.Parry, William Morris, p. 30 For 30 years, he reserved Mondays for portrait photography in his Pembroke Square studio. His sitters included the artists Walter Crane, William Morris, G. F. Watts, and Burne-Jones; the writers John Ruskin, H. G. Wells, and George Bernard Shaw; and the actresses Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry. Hollyer eschewed the formal poses of most studio portraiture of his day; in an 1899 interview in The Photogram he said Hollyer did much to establish photography as a fine art. His work was widely acclaimed in his own day; in 1897, a critic in The Studio lamented: Hollyer joined the Royal Photographic Society 1865 and became a Fellow in 1895, but was also involved in The Linked Ring, a society formed in to support pictorialism in opposition to the Photographic Society.Notes on Frederick Hollyer, National Portrait Gallery He was a member of the Solar Club and became one of the Founder Members of the Professional Photographers' Association in 1901.Harker, The Linked Ring, p. 153-54 Later life Frederick Hollyer married Mary Anne Armstrong (1838‚Äì1913).

Frederick Hollyer died 21 November 1933 at his eldest son's home in Blewbury (then part of Berkshire), aged 95.

He was born in Zerbst, the fourth (but second surviving) son of John VI, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Sophie Auguste, daughter of Frederick III, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. Life After the death of his father in 1667, Anthony G√ºnther received the castle of M√ºhlingen. During his minority, his mother the Dowager Princess Sophie Auguste acted as regent. In 1669 he and his older brother Karl William started their Grand Tour and visited Holland, England, France, and Italy; they only returned to Zerbst in 1672. Soon afterwards he began his military career and fought in Italy against France under the command of Johann Karl, Palatine Count of Birkenfeld, and was present at the sieges of Oudenaarde, Grave (1674) and Philippsburg (1676). After the Treaty of Nijmegen he stayed in Italy until 1681, when he returned to Zerbst. One year later he travelled again, this time to Denmark, Sweden, Courland, and Poland. Under the command of the Elector John George III of Saxony, he fought in the Battle of Vienna (1683). In 1689 the war against King Louis XIV of France was renewed; he moved with the Brandenburg troops outside Bonn, where he distinguished himself in battle; for this, the Elector Frederick III (later King Frederick I of Prussia) called him Obersten (\\"The Highest\\"). Anthony G√ºnther marched in 1690 with the Brandenburg troops to Brabant and became Commandant of Ath. In 1692 he fought in the Battle of Steenkerque, where he received five shots in his left arm. Hardly recovered from his wounds, he got another shot in Landau, once again in the arm. Now in charge of a battalion, King William III of England in 1694 appointed him Commander-in-Chief of a brigade of 9 battalions and in 1695 handed him over the governorship of Ath, whose fortress he had surrendered, however, after a brave defense, to Nicolas Catinat. In 1698 he was appointed Major-General by the Elector of Brandenburg, and at the same time received command of about 5000 Brandenburg H√ºlfstruppen who had acted in the service of the Dutch Republic. In this position he was present at the siege of Bonn and was wounded by a mat ball in the chest. After the taking of Bonn he went to Brabant and took Huy. Nonetheless, his health was severely weakened by so many wounds and shortly after resigned his command. After a visit to the Aachen baths, he returned from Berlin to Zerbst. In 1705 King Frederick I appointed him General-Lieutenant. Marriage and issue Around 1680, Anthony G√ºnther began an affair with the delicate and beautiful Auguste Antonie Marschall of Bieberstein (b. Zerbst, 3 March 1659 ‚Äì d. Calbe, 28 December 1736), a lady-in- waiting of his mother. She lived under the name of \\"Madame G√ºntherode\\" in Naumburg, where the prince regularly visited her in the short intervals between his long trips. The union only produced a daughter: #Antoinette [\\"von G√ºnthersfeld\\" from 1705] (b. Naumburg, 27 October 1681 ‚Äì d. Calbe, 16 November 1754), married first to Ernest Sigismund of Mergenthal (d. 1708), secondly on 24 September 1714 to Burchard Vollrath of Erlach (d. 1716), and thirdly on 24 May 1720 to Christian Albrecht of Platen (d. aft. 1754). After his definitive return home, Anthony G√ºnther formally married his beloved Auguste in Zerbst on 1 January 1705; shortly after, she was created \\"Frau von G√ºnthersfeld.\\" Because Auguste was born into the lesser nobility, the marriage was morganatic and their daughter Antoinette, legitimized by the wedding, could only assume the surname \\"von G√ºnthersfeld,\\" her mother's new title. The couple lived quietly at times in Zerbst and at times in Schloss M√ºhlingen. Dedicating himself during his last years to religion, Anthony G√ºnther died in Zerbst without male issue, and his principality was merged again into Anhalt-Zerbst.

She had been built as SS West Alsek for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as part of the West boats, cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States. She sailed on two voyages for the U.S. Navy before she was decommissioned after the Armistice. West Alsek was selected for a test program by the addition of coal pulverizers‚Äîunits that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers. She became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean depending solely on pulverized coal. Test results showed that she sailed faster and used less coal than before the conversion. West Alsek was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.  Design and construction  The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West, like West Alsek,Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358‚Äì59. named, in part, after the Alsek River in Alaska. West Alsek was one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington. West Alsek (Skinner & Eddy No. 22, USSB No. 87) was launched on 4 May 1918 and delivered to the United States Navy upon completion later in the month. West Alsek was built in a total of 78 working days, 92 calendar days,Hurley, pp. 92‚Äì93. and was tied with three other ships for tenth place on a list of the ten fastest constructed ocean-going vessels compiled in 1920.The other three ships tied for tenth-fastest were and ‚Äîboth also constructed by Skinner & Eddy, and Lake Gardner. See: Hurley, p. 93. Skinner & Eddy received a $25,000 bonus for completing the ship early.Shipping Board Operations, p. 624. The ship was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. West Alsek had a steel hull and a mean draft of . She displaced 12,226 t, and had a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a single triple-expansion steam engine powered by three coal-fired boilers that generated and drove her single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a pace.  Military career  USS West Alsek (ID-3119) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 4 June with Lieutenant Commander J. S. Gibson, USNRF, in command. West Alsek took on an initial load of 7,067 tons of flour and departed the Pacific Northwest on 15 June. After transiting the Panama Canal, she reached New York on 16 July.Many West ships, to avoid sailing empty to the East Coast, loaded grain products intended for the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, sailed to Europe without unloading or transferring their cargo, which avoided extra handling of the cargo. The United States Shipping Board, by prior arrangement, received an equivalent amount of cargo space in foreign ships for other American cargos. See: Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358‚Äì59. On 1 August, West Alsek joined Convoy HB-8 with , United States Army cargo transport , and 13 other ships for France. Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser Marseillaise, the convoy was some west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, one of three torpedoes from German submarine U-90 struck Montanan, while another torpedo from U-107 hit West Bridge, which was already adrift with engine trouble.Montanan and West Bridge remained afloat until the next morning. West Bridge was towed into Brest, France by four tugs; Montanan foundered and sank. See: Meanwhile, West Alsek and the other surviving ships of the convoy continued on and arrived at Verdon-sur-mer on 18 August. After unloading her cargo of flour and returning to the United States, West Alsek next sailed on 27 October in convoy to Quiberon and Nantes. West Alsek unloaded her cargo in Nantes from 15 November‚Äîfour days after the Armistice‚Äîto 30 December. Sailing for New York on that date, West Alsek arrived there on 19 January 1919. She was decommissioning on 27 January and returned to the USSB.  Civilian career  Little is known about West Alseks subsequent civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal‚Äîoften cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use‚Äîand grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers without the need for hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February. Upon completion of the conversion work, West Alsek was taken out for trials over two passes on a course on 19 June. Representatives from the USSB, the Navy Department, the United States Coast Guard, the Cunard Line, and Todd and other shipbuilders were on board‚Äîsome 125 guests in all. The ship cruised at an average of , some faster than she had ever steamed. After returning her guests to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, becoming the first ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic,, an oil-burning ship with coal pulverizing apparatus added, had been the first to cross the Atlantic via pulverized coal, but had crossed with her oil burners available as a backup. and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed that in addition to making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line. No information on West Alseks career after the coal pulverizing tests is available, but it is known that she was abandoned by the USSB, and scrapped in the fourth quarter of 1933.

Prior to its creation, disaster management in Mozambique was under the purview of the Department for the Prevention and Combat of Natural Disasters (, DPCCN), a subunit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation that mainly served as a \\"distributing agency for external aid\\". In contrast to its predecessor, the INGC was geared more toward coordination of disaster management efforts than delivery of foreign aid.

He was formerly the institute's deputy director and replaced Paulo Zucula, who was \\"widely praised\\" for his leadership of the INGC, when Zucula was appointed Minister of Transport and Communication. Activities The INGC is responsible for conducting mitigation efforts (such as collection and analysis of data), undertaking preparedness measures (e.g. awareness campaigns), and coordinating disaster response (including distribution of food, tents, and other supplies). Since June 2008 it is also responsible, through the Reconstruction Coordination Office (GACOR), for the resettlement of persons displaced by natural disasters. The INGC prepares for and responds to both natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones‚Äîthe three natural hazards to which Mozambique is most vulnerable‚Äîand man-made disasters, such as the 2008 South Africa riots. The INGC coordinates disaster management efforts with and receives support from public and private institutions, non-governmental organisations, and international organisations, including Concern Worldwide, the government of Germany, and the United Nations.

Old Talbott Tavern NRHP Nomination Form (Kentucky Heritage Commission, 1972) p. 2 History The Old Talbott Tavern was built in 1779, a year before the settlement of Salem (later renamed Bardstown) began, making it the \\"oldest western stagecoach stop\\" still in operation.Brown, Alan. Stories from the Haunted South (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2004) p. 98 According to an old map of Bardstown, the lot was originally purchased by a man named Hynes; the tavern was called the Hynes Hotel. It was strategically located near the end of the stagecoach road that once led east to Philadelphia and Virginia. George Rogers Clark used it as a resource base during the end of the American Revolutionary War; Daniel Boone stayed here, and the exiled Louis- Philippe of France, stayed at the tavern on October 17, 1797, with a member of his entourage painting murals that were rediscovered in the 20th century and were on display until the 1998 fire.Smith, pp. 2, 3Brown p. 98 Visitors in the 19th century included future presidents Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, and Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's parents stayed at the tavern when a court ruling went against them, leading the family to move to Indiana when Lincoln was only seven years old. Other prominent figures who visited the tavern were Henry Clay, the inventor of steamboats John Fitch, environmentalist John James Audubon, songwriter Stephen Foster, and Jesse James, who is said to have been the cause of the bullet holes in the murals as he was drunk and shooting at imaginary butterflies.Smith, p. 2History of the Tavern Talbotts.com, accessed September 1, 2008 George Talbott purchased the tavern in 1886.

Early life Born in Santa Cruz, CA as the 7th child of gold rush pioneer Titus Hale, the family moved to a farm on the lower Sacramento River in 1880. In 1885 Hale's sister Rose married a Sacramento cannery man, Joseph Peter Haller, who was hired to build the first cannery on Bristol Bay's Nushagak River earlier that year. Haller was then asked by William Bradford to build another cannery across the river and when he returned to Alaska in 1886, he brought along his 14-year-old brother in law Crescent. Crescent Hale, also known as Cress or Cres, returned to the Nushagak, near present-day Dillingham, AK, in the summers that followed. At the Bradford cannery, he was schooled in the salmon canning trade. He was there in 1893 when all four Nushagak canneries merged with others to form the Alaska Packers Association (APA), a cannery cartel designed to control production and sell off surplus stockpiles of canned salmon. At age 21, Cress was named superintendent of the Bradford cannery, later renamed the Diamond BB after the company name, the Bristol Bay Packing Co. Hale caught the eye of competitors and in 1899 the Pacific Steam Whaling Company hired 27-year-old Cress to build a salmon cannery at Nushagak Point and serve as its first superintendent. North Alaska Salmon Company Then in 1900, Joseph Haller formed the North Alaska Salmon Company and returned to Bristol Bay with two of his brothers-in-law. Cress Hale was named general superintendent of Haller's company and Hale's brother William as bookkeeper. Cress built two new canneries: one on the Kvichak River at a place named Hallerville and the other on the Egegik River across from the APA's Diamond E. Two years later, he expanded North Alaska's holdings again, building the Lockenok Cannery at the confluence of the Kvichak and Alagnak Rivers and then returned to the Nushagak to establish a cannery at Ekuk. The North Alaska Salmon Co. emerged as the biggest competitor to the APA and in 1903 briefly took the lead in a technological race to mechanize the salmon canning process. Canning operations were mostly mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, except for cleaning the fish itself which was mostly done by Chinese workers. Haller and Hale formed the Canners Machine Co. and allied with the Letson Burpee Co. of Seattle and ran its fish cleaning machines at all of its canneries. Hale was awarded patent 798,334 for his improvements to the machine in 1905, but eventually the design of Edmund Augustine Smith, better known as the \\"Iron Chink,\\" became the industry standard. In 1906, Hale married Mabel Eugenie Jackson, a dance hall girl from Rochester, New York and three years later, they had their only child, Elwyn. 1909 also saw publication of the first novel written about Bristol Bay, The Silver Horde by Rex Beach, and Cress Hale was assumed to be its inspiration. It's doubtful that Hale and Beach ever met however and most of Beach's novels were formulaic potboilers not drawn from real life but Cress Hale fit the bill. The Silver Horde is the story of a young cannery superintendent who takes on the cannery trust dominated by Chicago meat packers. At the time, Hale was superintendent of a company second only to the giant APA but the similarities end there. Real life concerns kept Hale busy. After mudflats blocked access to the Lockenok cannery in 1912, Hale staked a homestead claim on the Alagnak River to provide the cannery with riverfront access, even though it required a short rail line to get to the cannery. Likewise, the Hallerville cannery was plagued by mud flats. It closed in 1913 and Hale built another cannery on Kvichak Bay just above Pederson Point and moved the Hallerville equipment there. The salmon industry prospered early in the 20th century and the outbreak of the First World War created huge demand for salmon that soon pushed Bristol Bay's annual harvest over 20 million reds. Joseph Haller, however, died of a heart ailment in 1915 and the North Alaska Salmon Co. was sold to Libby, McNeill and Libby, ironically a Chicago-based meat packing concern such as the antagonist in The Silver Horde. Hale's relocated Hallerville cannery was renamed Libbyville. Cress Hale didn't sit idle for long. Praised in the trade journals as \\"one of the best all around, competent cannerymen in Western Alaska,\\" Hale bought the Alaska Salmon Company cannery on Wood River near Dillingham in 1916. He organized under the name Northern Fisheries and in 1918 bought the Union Fish Company, a major cod-fishing concern with roots that traced back to the acquisition of Alaska from Russia. In 1923 he bought the Bristol Bay Packing Company cannery at Pederson Point near Naknek. Hale recognized the potential of California sardines and bought the 420-foot Peralta in 1924 which he converted into a floating sardine reduction plant. The Peralta was an experimental ship with a hull built out of concrete due to a shortage of steel during the First World War. The 1920s were generally strong years for Bristol Bay salmon and Hale helped introduce popular culture to the region by showing movies at his Wood River cannery. The films attracted hundreds, including cannery workers and local residents. Serials and westerns were popular as well as cartoons like Krazy Kat and Mickey Mouse. Hale produced his own promotional movie, shot and edited by his Wood River cannery superintendent Joe Hidzik. Called Ice Kist Treasures after Hale's premier salmon brand, the film shows workers signing up, departing aboard cannery steamers, fishing boats, cannery operations and even a trip to the Wood Tikchik lakes. A copy of the film is available at the J. Porter Shaw library at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. As the roaring 20s came to a close, Cress Hale was nearing age 60 and after 40 years of canning salmon in Bristol Bay, he started thinking about retirement. Quietly, Hale began talking about selling out. He wanted $2.35 million and his timing seemed perfect. The industry was strong and markets healthy but events beyond his control soon ran against him: the stock market crash of 1929 and the forecast of a poor salmon return in 1930. The APA took an interest in Hale's operation primarily for access to his fishing boats, which were limited under a federal quota program. When they offered just $1.4 million, Hale turned the offer down and struck a deal with to custom pack salmon for the A&P; Tea Company which also operated the Nakeen cannery on the Kvichak River. 1936 fire The 1936 season was Cress Hale's 50th in Bristol Bay and it started off with all indications of a strong run of salmon. By July 7, midway through the season, Hale had packed 40,000 cases but after he made his daily afternoon rounds through the Pederson Point cannery and settled into his office to deal with paperwork, all hell broke loose. A fire started in a rear storage building and whipped by strong winds quickly spread through the wooden structure. The complex of buildings lacked any fire breaks and even worse, the heat buckled pipes that supplied the cannery with water. As fire hoses ran dry the fire spread unchecked from one building to the next. No one was injured but the loss of the cannery and its salmon pack was total. The cause of the fire was never determined. The facility was insured but the insurance and legal issues involved were so complicated, the insurance industry wrote a book about it called The Bristol Bay Fire. Hale returned to his home in Piedmont, California started drawing up plans to rebuild. His new design divided the canning lines into two separate buildings with a substantial fire break in between. In late February, 1937, Hale wrote President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning about reports of Japanese plans to fish for Bristol Bay salmon. Within a few months, the issue erupted into a major diplomatic dispute between the U.S. and Japan but Hale did not live to see it. On March 29, 1937, Hale died at age 65 of what was reported as thrombosis or blood clots. Mabel described his passing as, \\"A stanch ship sets sail for distant shores.\\" The book about the Bristol Bay fire was just coming off the press and his insurance brokers inserted a card that dedicated it to Hale. The cannery after Hale's death The rebuilding of the Pederson Point cannery took place as scheduled. Mabel visited both the Pederson Point and Wood River canneries in 1937 and erected bronze plaques as memorials to its fallen superintendent. Northern Fisheries reorganized with longtime VP Charlie Cocks as president and Elwyn Hale as secretary and manager. Mabel also took an active role in the company. Hale's canneries ran for the next three years but financial problems forced both to close after the 1939 season. Mabel continued to court a buyer and finally in 1943, the two Bristol Bay canneries were sold to Alaska Pacific Salmon Company for $1.1 million. The newly rebuilt Pederson Point cannery soon reopened under new leadership but the Wood River cannery was shuttered and dismantled. The site sat vacant for 40 years until another processor took interest in the location for a freezer plant. Mabel Eugenie Hale invested the earnings from her husband's fishing business in oil and potash leases and did quite well, amassing a small fortune that afforded her a comfortable home and a Rolls Royce. She became a patron of the arts and education and in 1962 endowed a foundation which she named after her late husband. The Crescent Porter Hale Foundation continues to this day and awards grants to Catholic schools and arts and education programs in the San Francisco area. Mabel outlived Elwyn, who never married and died in 1974 at age 65. Mabel Eugenie Hale lived to be 100. She died in 1982. Both the Peterson Point and Ekuk canneries remain operational today but Hale's other canneries have long since been dismantled or destroyed. A freezer plant occupies the site of the Wood River cannery and was recently purchased by Snopac Products. The Peralta and other World War I vintage concrete hulled ships remain afloat as part of a floating breakwater around a timber plant in Powell River, British Columbia.

She has been described as \\"a feminist before the movement had begun, and according to many, a visionary who influenced the course of Peru's recent history through the brave and defiant reporting of the magazine she created\\". Life and work Doris Gibson was born in Lima. Her father was the Peruvian poet of Scottish/German ancestry Percy Gibson Moller. She married an Argentine diplomat, Manlio Zileri. They had one child, Enrique Zileri, who also became an editor of Caretas. She had a relationship with the artist, S√©rvulo Guti√©rrez, for whom she was a muse as well as a lover. After Gibson and Guti√©rrez had a heated argument, he rid himself of a full-size nude painting that he had executed of Gibson. He sold it to a well-off businessman. When she learned of the transaction, Gibson traveled to the businessman's house with a photographer and, on the pretext of needing daylight for a photograph, took the painting outside and promptly drove away with it. When the man later asked for its return, she responded, \\"I don't want to be nude in your house.\\" Caretas Gibson started the weekly news magazine Caretas in 1950, using 10,000 soles which her uncle had lent her, along with a room and a typewriter.

Historically, it was commonly seen during pregnancy and in mothers who have just given birth. In cases of pregnancy, it is most often seen during the third trimester, resulting from a compression of the left common iliac vein against the pelvic rim by the enlarged uterus. Today, this disease is most commonly (40% of the time) related to some form of underlying malignancy. Hypercoagulability (a propensity to clot formation) is a well-known state that occurs in many cancer states. The incidence of this disease is not well reported. Cause The disease presumably begins with a deep vein thrombosis that progresses to total occlusion of the deep venous system. It is at this stage that it is called phlegmasia alba dolens. It is a sudden (acute) process. The leg, then, must rely on the superficial venous system for drainage. The superficial system is not adequate to handle the large volume of blood being delivered to the leg via the arterial system. The result is edema, pain and a white appearance (alba) of the leg. The next step in the disease progression is occlusion of the superficial venous system, thereby preventing all venous outflow from the extremity. At this stage it is called phlegmasia cerulea dolens. The leg becomes more swollen and increasingly more painful. Additionally, the edema and loss of venous outflow impedes the arterial inflow. Ischemia with progression to gangrene are potential consequences. Phlegmasia alba dolens is distinguished, clinically, from phlegmasia cerulea dolens in that there is no ischemia and congestion. In severe cases of venous obstruction the arterial pulse may gradually disappear and venous gangrene may ensue.Gregoire, R. La Phlebite bleue (Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens). 1938;48:1313-15. Diagnosis The condition can be identified clinically & as early as possible to prevent further deterioration & complications like embolism, ischaemic necrosis, and gangrene. The diagnosis is confirmed with Doppler ultrasound of the veins of the affected leg, and occasionally other imaging modalities. Treatment The mainstay of the treatment of deep vein thrombosis is with anticoagulation, but in very large DVTs various other modalities may be used to reduce the risk of complications. This may be surgical thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis.  Etymology  Phlegmasia alba dolens literally means \\"painful white edema\\". It received the name \\"milk leg\\" because it was once thought to be caused by the metastasis of milk.

The trilogy is a prequel series to The Mortal Instruments series, and contains some of the character's ancestors. Cassandra Clare has stated that the two series are able to be read in any order, but it is best to read in the order they were published to further understand the stories and avoid indirect spoilers. The series follows Tessa Gray, an orphaned teenage girl who discovers she has the power to shape-shift but doesn't bear a mark that shows she is a warlock. She is forced to learn how to control this newly established power and navigate the new world she was thrust into by means out of her control. The series follows Tessa's life as she lives in the London Institute with the Shadowhunters. The trilogy features William \\"Will\\" Herondale, James \\"Jem\\" Carstairs, Theresa \\"Tessa\\" Gray, and other Downworlders and Shadowhunters in the London Institute. It also features Magnus Bane, Camille Belcourt and other characters who appear in The Mortal Instruments series. The books also contain many quotes referring to famous pieces of Victorian Literature like Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and the works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Alfred Tennyson. Synopsis The series takes place in London England in 1878, a short time after the peace treaties between Downworlders and Shadowhunters. As Shadowhunters consider themselves superior or purer than Downworlders or demons, they may have no qualms about killing either. The first book in The Infernal Devices is entitled Clockwork Angel and begins the story of Tessa Gray, an orphan teenage girl who is looking for her brother Nathaniel Gray, who has disappeared, and seeks her true identity. Her search plunges her into a world she never knew existed, and reveals talents she never knew she had. She will have to learn to master them if she wants to find her brother, and must forge an alliance with Shadowhunters if she wants to survive in this dangerous world. Many of the family names of the Shadowhunters used in The Mortal Instruments are first introduced in this series. Another character in The Infernal Devices, Magnus Bane, the High Warlock of Brooklyn, also plays a part in this series. As Tessa Gray is drawn deeper into the Shadow world, and goes on the quest of finding her brother, she falls in love with two Shadowhunters‚Äìbut when it comes to choosing one, trouble begins to brew and suspense finds its way into her life. She will have to learn to hide her feelings if she hopes to survive. However, as her heart rages for love but her mind is bent on saving her brother, will she hide her vulnerable side? Which of the Shadowhunters will win her heart?  Publication history  # Clockwork Angel (August 31, 2010) # Clockwork Prince (December 6, 2011) # Clockwork Princess (March 19, 2013)  Characters  * Theresa \\"Tessa\\" Gray: A 16-year-old girl who has lived most of her life in New York until her brother Nate sends her a ticket to come to England. Upon arrival however, Tessa is taken captive by the Dark Sisters who introduce her own abilities to her, inevitably pulling her into the Shadow World. It is then revealed that Tessa is the daughter of a Greater Demon and a Shadowhunter, Elizabeth Gray (Adele Starkweather); as such, she is a warlock who is able to conceive children. She also has the ability to shapeshift into any person and acquire their memories, manners, and abilities after forming a psychic bond with an object of their possessions. She has grey-blue eyes and wavy brown hair. Tessa is romantically torn between Will Herondale and Jem Carstairs. After Jem becomes a Silent Brother, Tessa marries Will and has two children during their 60-year-marriage, Lucie and James, both of whom would go on to become the ancestors of the Blackthorn and the Herondale families. 70 years after Will's death, Tessa reunites with the now mortal Jem and rekindles their relationship. * William \\"Will\\" Owen or Gwilym Owain Herondale: A 17-year-old Shadowhunter who chose to become a part of the Shadow World at the age of 12. He was born in Wales to a mundane Welsh mother (Linette Herondale n√©e Owens) and an ex-Shadowhunter father (Edmund Herondale), can fluently speak both Welsh and English (along with Greek, Latin and many more languages). Despite being half-mundane, Will is still considered a full shadowhunter since shadowhunter blood is dominant. His parabatai is Jem Carstairs. He is known to have beautiful sapphire eyes and sleek back hair. Will has a dry sense of humour and very serious phobia of ducks which he explains away as the result of an experiment during which he fed poultry to ducks and they ate it without hesitation, causing him to mistrust the \\"bloodthirsty little beasts\\". In reality however, ducks painfully remind him of his late sister who helped him to rid himself of a black duck that seemed to have taken personal offense to a six-year-old Will and bit him on two separate occasions. http://cassandraclare.com/excerpts-extras/ducks/ All of his direct descendants seem to have inherited this phobia. Similarly, after coming in contact with Tessa's Clockwork Angel, a white star appears on Will's shoulder, and this mark becomes a feature of every Herondale man. Will falls in love with Tessa Gray and cannot stop loving her even when Tessa is engaged to Jem. At the end of the series, Will marries Tessa, having two children, Lucie and James, with her. Jem has to separate from both of them now that he is a Silent Brother, however, when Will dies in 1937 of old age, his family and friends, Tessa, and Jem are all by his side. * James \\"Jem\\" Carstairs or Ke Jian Ming: A 17-year- old Shadowhunter who was forced to live in the London Institute after the slaughter of his parents in the Shanghai Institute. After being physically tortured by a demon who constantly fed him with the drug yin fen, Jem became sickly and is deathly dependent on yin fen. Though the drug is slowly killing him, he is forced to live on it to stay alive. Being half-Chinese (from mother Ke Wen Yu) and half-English (from father Jonah Carstairs), Jem speaks fluent Mandarin. His allegiance is with the Enclave. Jem's parabatai is Will Herondale. He is known to have silver eyes and silver hair: a side-effect from consuming yin fen; however, when he appears healed from the yin fen, Jem is described as having dark brown hair and eyes of Asian descent. Jem falls in love with Tessa and gets engaged with her; however, the engagement falls through when Jem has to turn into a Silent Brother in order to stay alive. In the epilogue, set in 2008, Jem, now a mortal, reunites with Tessa at the Blackfriars Bridge and rekindles their relationship. * Sophia \\"Sophie\\" Collins: Prior to working at the London Institute, Sophie was a parlor maid, working for the Atkins family in St. James Wood. She was very beautiful, therefore, she was offered the job. Sophie's employer's son attempted to seduce her, but she turned him away repeatedly. The son raged out at her, and took and knife and cut open her face, saying if he could not have her, then no one will ever want her again. Sophie went to her mistress but the boy claimed she tried to seduce him, and cut her to protect his virtue. She was thrown on the streets, and Charlotte Branwell then took in Sophie. Sophie was born with 'the Sight', therefore, she could see Charlotte when she was glamoured at the time. At the end of the series, Sophie undergoes Ascension to become a Shadowhunter and marries Gideon Lightwood, having two daughters (Barbara and Eugenia) and one son (Thomas) with him. * Jessamine \\"Jessie\\" Lovelace: Jessamine is a Shadowhunter who detests everything about being a Shadowhunter. Despite loathing the Shadowhunter life and willing to do anything to leave it behind, Jessamine can be dangerous if she wants to be. She lost her parents when she was a child. She is also known to have a dollhouse in her bedroom of the London Institute with \\"Baby Jessie\\" as Jessamine calls the doll. She was married to Nate Gray, whom she helped at the expense of the Clave, until his death. For this, Jessie is punished by having her wealth confiscated, but just as she returns to the London Institute, a carriage with automatons attacks the Institute and kills Jessie, who leaves the Clave in her dying breaths that Mortmain is in Cadar Idris, a mountain in Wales. Her ghost returns to protect the Institute. * Henry Jocelyn Branwell: Absent-minded and brilliant, Henry spends his waking hours in the crypt of the Institute, inventing fabulous machines and weapons out of cogs, cams and gears. Unfortunately just as many of Henry's inventions do not work as the ones that do, and Henry is as likely to set himself on fire as he is to invent something new and amazing. He invented the portal with the help of one magnificent warlock, Magnus Bane. He becomes crippled after a demonic automaton attacks and almost kills him. At the end of the series, Henry takes Charlotte's maiden name, Fairchild, and has two sons with her: Charles and Matthew. * Charlotte Mary Branwell (n√©e Fairchild): 23-year-old Charlotte, wife of Henry Branwell, runs the entire Institute with a capable hand. Kind and loving, she does her best to care for the orphaned Shadowhunters who live under her roof whilst hiding her loneliness from the absent-minded husband she loves. It seems as if there is nothing Charlotte cannot manage ‚Äî until Tessa's search for her missing brother begins to uncover a web of corruption and deceit in London's Downworld that threatens to tear London's Enclave of Shadowhunters apart. At the end of the series, Charlotte reverts to using her maiden name and has two sons (Charles and Matthew) who inherit their mother's maiden name. * Axel Mortmain: The antagonist of this series, he is the one responsible for the clockwork creatures. He plots to destroy all Shadowhunters to avenge his warlock parents. He is a very dangerous man, and he needs Tessa Gray for the last key to his michevious plan to overrule the Shadowhunters. He is later known to have \\"created\\" Tessa to prove that a half-demon, half-shadowhunter warlock is naturally better than a normal shadowhunter. He is killed at the end of the series by the spirit of Ithuriel summoned by Tessa. * Magnus Bane: An ancient warlock whose origins reside in Indonesia. He is flamboyant, but also wise. Early on, he has a romantic relationship with a vampire, Camille Belcourt. Magnus is a friend of Will Herondale, and aids him - and the other Shadowhunters - with various problems they encounter throughout the series. Magnus was said to take a liking towards Will Herondale. * Camille Belcourt: A vampire and a lover of Magnus Bane. She is also acquainted with Alexei de Quincey, but vows to take revenge against him when he killed her lover, a werewolf named Ralf Scott. Tessa disguises as her, with Will accompanying her as her \\"subjugate\\", during a ball held by de Quincey, but Camille is forced to go on the run when the commotion kills almost all vampires in the area. She returns home after a brief stay in Saint Petersburg, but Magnus is disappointed that Camille does not love him the way she did before and he decides to break up with her, kissing Will as proof. * Benedict Lightwood: A demon-crazy shadowhunter, Benedict comes from the wealthy Lightwood family and expected himself to be elevated to the position of the head of the London Institute, but was furious when Charlotte took the job and vowed to bring her down. He allies himself with Axel Mortmain in exchange for medicine that heals his demon pox that slowly turns him into a demonic worm. When his son, Gideon, learns about this, he betrays his father and defects to the London Institute. Benedict's other son, Gabriel follows suit and kills his father after the latter has fully changed into a worm. All this turns the Lightwood family into a laughing stock in the Shadow World and their prestige is only brought back by his well-behaved sons. * Gabriel Lightwood: The second son of Benedict and Barbara Lightwood, Gabriel was raised by his father believing that breaking the rules of the Law is the right thing to do, as with his siblings. He holds resentment towards Will Herondale ever since the latter humiliated his sister, Tatiana, and broke his arm when he went emotional. When his father instructs his sons to train Tessa, Sophie, and Jessie, Gabriel chooses to train Tessa hands-on, mainly to irritate Will. Unlike his brother, Gideon, Gabriel is quite loyal to his father and stays by his side when the truth about his alliance with Mortmain is revealed. However, when Benedict turns into a demonic worm as a result of his demon pox, Gabriel deals the killing blow when he realizes that his father is not himself anymore. At the end of Clockwork Princess, Gabriel begins to get along well with Will while also marrying the latter's sister, Cecily Herondale, having two sons (Christopher and Alexander) and one daughter (Anna) with her. * Nathaniel \\"Nate\\" Gray: Nate Gray is introduced as Tessa's older brother who invites her to come to England to join him after their aunt, Harriet's death. Tessa learns from the Dark Sisters that Nate has been kidnapped and will be killed if she does not agree to use her powers. Eventually, Nate is rescued from Alexei de Quincey and brought to the London Institute for questioning. However, it is revealed that Nate has been in league with Axel Mortmain, the true \\"Magister\\", all along, and betrays Tessa by giving her to Mortmain, though she is able to fake her death. In Clockwork Prince, Jessie becomes smitten by Nate and is manipulated by him to betray the Institute and provide information for him and Mortmain. At the end of the book, Nate reveals that he and Tessa are only cousins since Harriet is Nate's actual mother, while the following book, Clockwork Princess, reveals that the two have never been related, since Tessa's mother, \\"Elizabeth Gray\\", was really Adele Starkweather, a Shadowhunter switched by the faeries with Nate's true aunt, Elizabeth Moore. Nate is killed when he is struck by sharp metal from automatons that explode with Henry's inventions. * Alexei de Quincey: A powerful vampire leading the London vampire clan, de Quincey is suspected as \\"the Magister\\" and the head of the Pandemonium Club. He was once acquainted with Camille Belcourt, but the relationship ended when he killed Ralf Scott, Camille's werewolf lover, after which both Camille and Ralf's brother, Woolsey, swore revenge against him. Mortmain uses him as a distraction while he infiltrates the London Institute to capture Tessa. When the Shadowhunters meet with de Quincey, he is only barely guarded and laughs at them for falling to Mortmain's trick. He is then killed by Benedict Lightwood. * Gideon Lightwood: The eldest son of Benedict and Barbara, and the older brother of Gabriel and Tatiana, Gideon is the one most skeptical about his father's teachings and is even embarrassed when he learns that all that his father taught to him about flouting the Law is wrong. He becomes an instructor for the new Shadowhunters at the London Institute and becomes close to the mundane maid, Sophie. Eventually, he betrays his father in favor of Sophie and the Institute, telling them about his father's dealings with Mortmain. At the end of the series, Gideon marries Sophie and has three children (Barbara, Eugenia, and Thomas) with her. He and Gabriel also bring back his family's reputation after Benedict plunged them due to his antics. * Cecily Herondale: Will's younger sister whom he left alongside their parents after accidentally causing their older sister, Ella's death when he was 12 years old. Even if years had passed, Cecily is still remembered by Will; her name is what he says when he is recovering from vampire blood, though Tessa mistakes her as someone Will once dated. In turn, Cecily also misses her brother terribly and is relieved when Ragnor Fell does not deny that he visits the Herondale residence on Will's behalf. Eventually, Cecily becomes a Shadowhunter, at first to convince Will to return home, but later because she realizes that the world which she taught was dangerous is actually challenging and enjoyable. At the end of Clockwork Princess, Cecily marries Gabriel Lightwood and has three children (Anna, Christopher, and Alexander) with him. * Aloysius Starkweather: A grumpy old Shadowhunter, Aloysius Starkweather has been the leader of the York Institute for many years. He holds deep resentment towards Downworlders, especially when it was discovered that his granddaughter, Adele, was switched by the faeries and replaced by a sickly mundane girl who went insane and died while receiving her Marks. He also does not get along well with Charlotte Branwell due to a disagreement he had with her father, but Charlotte has no choice but get his help for a lead to Mortmain. In Clockwork Princess, it is revealed that Aloysius' granddaughter, who was switched as the faerie's revenge for their killings, was Elizabeth Gray, Tessa's mother, making Tessa a half-Shadowhunter. Aloysius is killed by the automatons during a Clave meeting, right after he realizes that he should have listened to Charlotte. * Woolsey Scott: A werewolf who leads both the London werewolf clan and the Praetor Lupus, which he created in memory of his brother, Ralf, who was killed by Alexei de Quincey for continuing his relationship with Camille Belcourt. He becomes satisfied with de Quincey's death and informs the London Institute that Mortmain is purchasing the entire stock of the yin fen medication, meaning that Jem's life is in danger. Later, Woolsey begins a relationship with Magnus Bane after the latter breaks up with Camille by the time Will and Tessa visit him to request Magnus more yin fen. Woolsey suspects that Tessa is a fey, though she is actually both a warlock and a shadowhunter. At the end of Clockwork Princess, Woolsey and Magnus have broken off their relationship, though Woolsey gives him a silver snuffbox before leaving.

St. Peter's is affiliated with the Christian Brothers of St. John Baptist de la Salle, and is a member of the CHSAA. The school is located at 200 Clinton Avenue and is part of St. Peter's parish on Staten Island, which also ran a grammar school and all-girls high school. History Origins The origins of St. Peter's Boys' High School can be traced back to 1839, with the dedication of St. Peter's parish. With the arrival of three Christian Brothers in 1917, the school was founded on Richmond Terrace in the New Brighton area of Staten Island. Father Joseph Farrell and other local clergy took over operation of the school in 1920 when the Brothers were withdrawn due to World War I. The Brothers would return ten years later in 1930. At this time, there were more Brothers at the school than ever before. In 1937, the main campus of St. Peter's Boys' HS, was designated as a junior college of Manhattan College, another Lasallian institution. By 1943, the junior college closed and St. Peter's Boys High School relocated to that campus. The main campus of St. Peter's Boys High School has remained there since, on the corner of Clinton and Henderson Avenues. The institution maintains an alumni community, including the St. Peter's High School Glee Club and Seton Chorale Alumni who organize an annual scholarship benefit Christmas concert for their late instructor, Carl Lesch.

By 1969, however, the school's closing was imminent. The community rallied around St. Peter's and local support prevented the school from closing. As of 2001, the school's enrollment was 740 students. The Brothers' involvement in the school has been in decline due to a continual decrease in men entering the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. In 2001, eight Brothers taught at the school along with two Sisters of St. Joseph and 31 lay faculty members. In 2009, the varsity football team won the CHSAA single A championship 41‚Äì0 against the Bishop Ford Falcons.http://nychsfl.org/ In 1989, senior Sal Kader and junior John Schwall won the NYC CHSAA wrestling individual championships at 177 and 119 pounds respectively. Kader also placed second overall in the NYS CHSAA state championship.

KG., a subsidiary of Voith. The most powerful single-engined diesel-hydraulic locomotive in the world, the Maxima 40CC is rated at 3,600 kW. Initially two versions of a 6 axle C'C' machine were offered with medium speed engines from the Anglo-Belgian Corporation; the Maxima 30CC and Maxima 40CC. In 2008 a third model, the Maxima 20BB, a 4 axle B'B' machine was added to the range. In January 2010, Czech company Lostr (after September 2010 renamed Legios) signed an agreement to manufacture under license the Voith Maxima locomotives. The Czech built locomotives were marketed as Legios General. History Background Voith had supplied components to the railway industry since the 1930s - in particular its hydraulic transmissions. Merger of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and Deutsche Bundesbahn in the 1994 resulted in the German state railways acquiring many high-powered diesel locomotives of the DR Class 130 family, which reduced any opportunities for sale of a high power transmission to the Deutsche Bahn in the medium term. However, in 2004 Nord-Ostsee-Bahn acquired a contract to operate the Marschbahn from December 2005, and contracted Vossloh to build new locomotives (\\"R3000 CC\\") to operate it; the locomotive's design specifications were a top speed of 160 km/h and power of over 3MW. Initially the service was to be operated by the MaK DE 2700 type, before the new 'R3000' locomotives were built. The LS 640 reU2 transmission (input power 4.2MW.) was a result of development work by Voith for the \\"R3000\\" locomotive's transmission. The 'Turbo Split' LS 640 transmission was first exhibited at Innotrans in 2004 - a key feature of the new transmission was the ability to separately control two outputs from the input - enabling wheelslip control per bogie., English version In 2005 Vossloh acquired Alstom's Meinfesa plant (Valencia, Spain), and with it a license to manufacturer GM-EMD based diesel electric locomotives - as a result Vossloh abandoned the 'R3000' development, instead offering the Vossloh Euro and Vossloh G2000 designs for mainline work. The Euro 4000 was offered to the Marschbahn instead of the 'R3000'. Sources: As a result of the loss of an outlet for its new transmission Voith began development of a new high-powered mainline locomotive - the Voith Maxima. Maxima and Gravita development Voith then developed in house new high-powered diesel locomotive series along with single cab shunting and trip freight locomotives, the Voith Gravita series. With a development period of just 500 days, the first locomotive was ready in 2006 and presented at the InnoTrans 2006 fair. The locomotive design won a red dot design award in 2007. A new factory in Kiel was established in 2006 by Voith to manufacture the new locomotives. In 2008 at Innotrans Voith added a third potential model to its Maxima range, the 4 axle Maxima 20BB. The type was expected to be a competitor for a 200 locomotive order from Deutsche Bahn for diesel locomotives for passenger and freight services to replace the \\"DB V 160 family\\" of locomotives; in 2011 the Deutsche Bahn AG order was won by Bombardier Transportation with a new multi- engine type of its TRAXX platform. Career and orders After the exhibition of the demonstrator locomotive at the InnoTrans 2006 fair, it was tested on several German main lines to receive German certification. It was also tested on the Velim test ring and also went to Norway and Sweden for thermal testing. Final German certification was granted on 23 December 2008 by the German rail authority EBA. A second demonstrator locomotive was built and equipped with Dutch and Belgian safety systems for obtaining Dutch and Belgian certification. It was tested in the first and second quarter of 2008 in the Netherlands, and in Belgium in the fourth quarter. After Dutch and Belgian certification the locomotive will be passed on to HGK for testing. A third and last demonstrator locomotive is being built and will be used to obtain certification in Poland, Sweden and Norway. As of 2008, 32 locomotives have been ordered, with options for a further 29: * Ox-traction, a Dutch leasing company in which Voith held a 44% stake, was to order 15 Maxima 40CC and 15 Maxima 30CC locomotives, with a potential option of a further 23 Maxima locomotives. Its first Maxima 40CC locomotive was delivered in April 2009 and was immediately leased to LOCON. In August 2010 Ox-traction ended its business activities. Locomotives previously leased and marketed over Ox-traction are now leased directly from Voith. * HVLE ordered 2 Maxima 40CC locomotives. The first was delivered in April 2009, the second in April 2010. HVLE took an option on a further 6 locomotives. Technology The locomotive's body consists entirely of steel. Both cabins have two seats (one for the train driver and one for a relief driver or supervisor) and have a standardised and ergonomical control desk. The cabins also have air conditioning and are equipped with all modern needs of today's operating conditions. Powered by either an 16VDZC or 12VDZC engine by Belgian engine manufacturer Anglo-Belgian Corporation, rated at respectively 3,600 kW or 2,750 kW, the locomotive can reach a top speed of 120 km/h (160 km/h optionally) and has a maximal tractive effort of 519 kN. The normal tractive effort is 408 kN. The LS 640 reU2 \\"Turbosplit\\" transmission allows for a separated traction and wheelslip control of each bogie. This is the first locomotive series equipped with this new technology. Brake equipment consists of electro-pneumatic and engine compression brakes. The smallest drivable curve radius is 80m. The locomotive can take up to 9,000 or 10,000 l of fuel, depending on the configuration. The locomotives are assembled at a new plant next to the Nord-Ostsee-Kanal in Kiel. Large maintenance and overhauls will be carried out in a new central workshop in Cologne, to be operated jointly by Voith Turbo and HGK. Variants Voith initially offered 2 variants of this locomotive: the most powerful version is the Maxima 40CC with 3,600 kW power, intended for freight operators with heavy trains of up to 3,000 tonnes. A less powerful version is the Maxima 30CC with 2,750 kW power, primarily intended for freight operators with trains of up to 2,500 tonnes or passenger operators. A third version the Maxima 20BB was added to the range in 2007. Models Voith signed an exclusive contract with Saxon model building company S√§chsische Waggonfabrik Stollberg to build a H0-model of both Maxima variants. All parts of the locomotive will be engineered and made in Germany.
