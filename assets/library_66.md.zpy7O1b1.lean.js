The film stars Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott as two best friends who find themselves unable to remember where they parked their vehicle after a night of recklessness. Supporting cast members include Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Garner, and Marla Sokoloff. Though the film was panned by most critics, it was a box office success and has managed to achieve a cult status, partially from frequent airings on cable television. The film's title became a minor pop culture saying, and was commonly reworked in various pop cultural contexts during the 2000s. Plot Best friends Jesse and Chester awaken with hangovers and no memory of the previous night. The television is on, showing an Animal Planet program about how animals use twigs and rocks as tools to get food. Their refrigerator is filled with containers of chocolate pudding, and the answering machine contains an angry message from their twin girlfriends Wilma and Wanda as to their whereabouts. They emerge from their home to find Jesse's car missing, and with it their girlfriends' first-anniversary presents. The two were also fired from their jobs. This prompts Jesse to ask the film's titular question: \\"Dude, where's my car?\\" Because the girls have promised them a \\"special treat\\", which Jesse and Chester take to mean sexual intercourse, the men are desperate to retrieve their car. The duo begins retracing their steps in an attempt to discover where they left the car. Along the way, they encounter a transgender stripper, a belligerent speaker box operator at a Chinese restaurant's drive-through (voiced by Freda Foh Shen), two tattoos they discover on each other's backs, UFO cultists led by Zoltan (who later hold the twins hostage), a Cantonese-speaking Chinese tailor, the Zen-minded Nelson and his cannabis-loving dog Jackal, the attractive Christie Boner, her aggressive jock boyfriend Tommy and his friends, a couple of hard- nosed police detectives, and a reclusive French ostrich farmer named Pierre. They also meet two groups of aliens, one group being five gorgeous women, the other being two Norwegian men, searching for the \\"Continuum Transfunctioner\\": an extraterrestrial device that the boys accidentally picked up last night. After Pierre releases the duo for correctly answering a question about ostriches, Jesse and Chester head over to a local arcade named Captain Stu's Space-O-Rama. Once inside, they encounter Zoltan and his cultists who give them Wilma and Wanda in exchange for a toy that Jesse and Chester try to pass off as the Transfunctioner. Tommy, Christie, and the jocks arrive along with Nelson and his dog, whom they release after Tommy snatches the fake Transfunctioner from Zoltan. The two sets of aliens arrive and notify of the real Continuum Transfunctioner: a Rubik's Cube that Chester has been working hard to solve, and eventually does, causing the device to shapeshift into its true form. They are warned that once the five lights stop flashing, the universe will be destroyed. Jesse and Chester must determine which of two sets of aliens is entitled to the device. One of the groups is there to protect the universe, the other is there to destroy it. Both claim to be the protectors of the universe, stating that they were with Jesse and Chester the previous night, which Jesse and Chester still cannot remember, and ask for the Transfunctioner. The two correctly choose the men, because when the men were asked what they did the night before, they correctly respond that they got a hole in one at the 18th hole at the arcade's miniature golf park, and won a lifetime supply of pudding. At the last second, they deactivate the Transfunctioner, saving the universe. Thwarted, the five alien women merge to become a beautiful giantess clad in a purple bra and miniskirt. She devours Tommy alive in front of Christie, who reacts with indifference. The giantess then crawls out of the amusement center and chases Jesse and Chester. The cultists tell them to activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam on the Transfunctioner. However, the button that activates it is too far in to reach. At the last second, Chester remembers the nature show with the tool-using chimps and uses a straw to push the recessed button, thus destroying the alien. Tommy survives, but Christie breaks up with him in favor of Nelson. The protectors thank Jesse, Chester and the twins for saving the world, and erase their minds concerning the events. The protectors park the duo's car, a Renault Le Car, behind a mail truck for them to find the following morning. Jesse and Chester salvage their relationships with the twins and discover the special treat from the girls turns out to be matching berets with Jesse and Chester's names knitted in the front. The protectors leave a gift for their girlfriends (and, for the two men): Breast Enhancement Necklaces. The film ends with Jesse, Chester, and the twins going in Jesse's car out for Chinese food while arguing what the tattoo said on each other's back. Cast Production Filming took place from June 12, 2000 to August 1, 2000. Release =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 17% based on reviews from 58 critics, with an average rating of 3.59/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The movie isn't funny, the plot is too thin, and the production values feel more like a TV sitcom than a movie.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. The BBC Films review gave it 1 star, calling the film \\"a lame-brained travesty\\" and \\"intensely irritating\\" and Kutcher and Scott's routines \\"painfully unamusing\\". USA Today said: \\"Any civilization that can produce a movie this stupid probably deserves to be hit by famine and pestilence.\\" The Chicago Tribune said: \\"At the end of 83 unmerciful minutes, audiences will be exclaiming, 'Dude, I can't believe I sat through that movie!?'\\" and the New York Post said that it was: \\"An almost chuckle-free mess, so amateurish and lame that the cast often has that embarrassed look you see on dogs given ridiculous haircuts.\\" However, the New York Daily News did praise the \\"surprisingly sweet-natured pairing\\" of Kutcher and Scott. =Box office= The film opened at #2 at the North American box office, grossing US$13.8 million in its opening weekend behind What Women Want, which opened at the top spot with US$33 million. Its overall gross came to $46 million in the US and $73.2 million in total worldwide from a $13 million budget. =Home media= The DVD was released on June 26, 2001, with 7 deleted and extended scenes, an audio commentary with Kutcher, Scott, and Leiner, a behind-the- scenes featurette, the music video for Grand Theft Audio's \\"Stoopid Ass\\", TV spots, and the theatrical trailer. The VHS version was released on November 6, 2001. The film was later released on Blu-ray; the only special feature is the inclusion of the original theatrical trailer. On TV in the United States, when Jesse and Chester first see Christie Boner, they say her name, but when they get to \\"Bon-\\", the words are cut and the shot moves to Christie.Dude, Where's My Car?

The habit started after the Pirates (in particular Neil Walker) were watching Dude, Where's My Car? in the visiting clubhouse at Turner Field in Atlanta during an April 2012 weekend series against the Atlanta Braves. After a Twitter campaign to encourage the \\"real\\" Zoltan to appear at a game, Hal Sparks flew to Pittsburgh on July 25, 2012 to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, and was on hand to see the Pirates win 3‚Äì2 over his hometown team, the Chicago Cubs. Also there to support the team was Hal's girlfriend, Summer Soltis, whose family is from the area and are Pirates fans themselves. Despite picking up a cult following in Pittsburgh and helping the team contend in the playoff race well into September, the Pirates finished with a 79‚Äì83 record, extending their major North American professional sports record to 20 consecutive losing seasons. Possible sequel A sequel titled Seriously Dude, Where's My Car? was in development for years, but never materialized. In 2016, Kutcher confirmed the existence of a script for Seriously Dude, Where's My Car? and further elaborated that he would not be completely against reprising his role in the sequel. In August 2017, Scott discussed his interest in making a sequel and that he would desire it to be rated R and \\"dark and really weird\\".

In Burmese it means \\"near the big river\\", and Myitkyina is on the west bank of the Ayeyarwady River, just below from Myit-son (Burmese for confluence) of its two headstreams (the Mali and N'mai rivers). It is the northernmost river port and railway terminus in Myanmar. The city is served by Myitkyina Airport. History Myitkyina has been an important trading town between China and Myanmar since ancient times. American Baptist missionary George J. Geis and his wife arrived in Myitkyina in the late 1890s and in 1900 they requested permission to build a mansion in the town. The building was named Geis Memorial Church It is one of the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC)churches in Myitkyina. Japanese forces captured the town and nearby airbase during World War II in 1942. In August 1944, Myitkyina was recaptured by the Allied forces under General Joseph Stilwell after a prolonged siege and heavy fighting between Nationalist Chinese divisions, the Chindits, and Merrill's Marauders of the Northern Combat Area Command and the besieged elements of the 33rd Imperial Japanese Army under General Masaki Honda. The town was strategically important not only because of its rail and water links to the rest of Burma, but also because it was on the planned route of the Ledo Road. Transportation Myitkyina Airport is the main airport serving the city. It connects the cities of Putao and Mandalay. And it also connects Lashio Airport every Monday. It takes almost 24 hours Mandalay to Myitkyina by train. The railway has been used for 100 years. This railway is major transportation for most kinds of good for both farmers and traders. It also connects Laiza, Bhamo, China, and Sumprabum by car. The Myitkyina-Tanai-India road which is known as the Ledo Road, was constructed by the British rule during the British Colonial period. In the downtown, the main transportation are three wheel motor cycle also known as tone bain, three wheel bicycle, and motor bike. Myitkyina Train Station Population The Kachin State Parliament building in Myitkyina As the capital of the state, it has government offices, and a greater population than other cities in the state. The city has a population of approximately 150,000, with a mix of Kachin, Shan, Bamar peoples and some Chinese and Indians. The Kachin language is the common language among the Kachin. There are a lot of meaning for Jinghpo word. In Jinghpo language, Jinghpo means People. Some people can speak English and Nepali while the town's people mostly speak in Burmese which is the national language of Myanmar. Foreigners are now free to visit Myitkyina without prior government permission. =Religion= Major religions are Theravada Buddhism, Christianity (Roman Catholic and Baptist are major denominations), and other religions such as animism, Hinduism and Islam. Climate Myitkyina has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwa) bordering on a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year, although the winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary) are milder. There is a winter dry season (November‚ÄìApril) and a summer wet season (May‚ÄìOctober).  Air Quality  The city residents dispose of the majority of their waste by burning it in small piles by the roadside. Most waste is disposed in this way, including plastics. Almost every block in the city has one small fire every evening. Burning usually starts late-afternoon, and by 6.00pm the city air is often quite smoky. Burning can start earlier at the weekend. The air quality in Myitkyina in the evenings can be poor, which can make being outside unpleasant. Sometimes, due to atmospheric pressure, the air will still be smoky in the morning. The only time of year that this does not happen is during the monsoon season, when it is reported that the air is fresh.  Education  The city is home to Myitkyina University, a Christian theological seminary, a college for teachers, a training school for nurses, a college for the study of computers and other rare type of colleges affiliated with several seminaries in the United States and Asia, notably Kachin Theological College-Nawng Nang. It is also home to the branch I.L.B.C. (International Language Business Center) a chain of private schools for English learners in the Myanmar. It has also many non-government institutions such as Naushawng development institute, Pinnya Tagar, Ningshawng and Kachinland School of Arts & Sciences,http://www.KachinlandSAS.org which has a University vision in 2024.

Resources are jade, gold, amber, teak and forestry products, and agricultural products. Due to short term contract of jade, gold mines, teak, Kachin State was good in business field for Chinese. As per government data, almost US$2 billion in jade were exported yearly in 2010, 2011. Now, due to fighting between Kachin KIA rebels and government army, all business have gone down. Most of Kachin State business trades are done in Myitkyina.

Most antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists, and as such they have found use in treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and stimulant psychosis. Several other dopamine antagonists are antiemetics used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. Receptor pharmacology Dopamine receptor flow chart Dopamine receptors are all G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors, and are divided into two classes based on which G-protein they are coupled to. The D1-like class of dopamine receptors is coupled to GŒ±s/olf and stimulates adenylate cyclase production, whereas the D2-like class is coupled to GŒ±i/o and thus inhibits adenylate cyclase production. =D1-like receptors: D1 and D5= D1-like receptors ‚Äì D1 and D5 are always found post-synaptically. The genes coding these receptors lack introns, so there are no splice variants. D1 receptors * D1 receptors are found mainly on neurons in the nucleus accumbens as well as substantia nigra, striatum, amygdala, frontal cortex and olfactory bulb and retina * Also found (in lower levels) in the hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus * Peripherally, these receptors have been found in the renal artery, mesenteric artery, and splenic artery where activation leads to vasodilation. In addition, D1 receptors have been found in the kidney D5 receptors * Low levels of D5 receptors have been found in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex; as well as memory areas such as hippocampus, dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex. * In addition, D5 receptors have been found in the kidney =D2-like receptors: D2, D3 and D4= D2-like receptors unlike the D1-like class, these receptors are found pre and post-synaptically. The genes that code these receptors have introns, leading to many alternately spliced variants. D2 receptors * D2 receptors are found in the striatum, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, hypothalamus, cortex, septum, amygdala, hippocampus, and olfactory tubercle. * These receptors have also been found in the retina and pituitary gland. * Peripherally, these receptors have been found in the renal, mesenteric, and splenic arteries as well as on the adrenal cortex and medulla and within the kidney. D3 receptors * D3 receptors are highly expressed on neurons in islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens shell and lowly expressed in areas such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, hippocampus, septal area, and ventral tegmental area. * Additional studies have found these receptors peripherally in the kidney D4 receptors * D4 receptors are found in amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticula, the thalamus, the retina and the kidney Implications in disease The dopaminergic system has been implicated in a variety of disorders. Parkinson's disease results from loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. Furthermore, most effective antipsychotics block D2 receptors, suggesting a role for dopamine in schizophrenia. Additional studies hypothesize dopamine dysregulation is involved in Huntington's disease, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, major depression, manic depression, addiction, hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Dopamine receptor antagonists are used for some diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, nausea and vomiting. * Melatonin suppresses dopamine activity as part of normal circadian rhythm functions, although pathological imbalances have been implicated in Parkinson's disease Side effects They may include one or more of the following and last indefinitely even after cessation of the dopamine antagonist, especially after long-term or high-dosage use: * Cardiovascular diseasethumb * Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with typical antipsychotics: ** Early stage ‚Äì occurs at onset of treatment or following increased dose, patients recover when dose is decreased *** Acute dystonias ‚Äì muscle spasms and sustained abnormal postures and onset occurs within a few days; can be treated with anticholinergics **** risk factors include age, gender and family history *** Akathisia  pacing and restlessness and onset occurs within the first few months; can be treated with beta blockers and benzodiazepines *** Parkinsonism due to effects on the nigrostriatal pathway  includes tremors, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity **** risk factors include age and gender ** Late stage ‚Äì occurs after prolonged (months-years) treatment, symptoms persist even after dose is decreased *** Tardive dyskinesia  includes involuntary and repetitive facial movements **** risk factors include age, race and gender ** It is hypothesized that these effects are due to chronic blockade of the D2 receptor * Hyperprolactinaemia due to blockade of the D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary leading to increased prolactin release * Increased appetite including increased craving and binge eating that lead to weight gain * Increased risk for insulin resistance * Sexual dysfunction * Metabolic changes with increased risk of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 * Sedation Examples =First-generation antipsychotics (typical)= First generation antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia and are often accompanied by extrapyramidal side effects. * Benperidol binds D2 and some serotonin receptors. It is absorbed very easily and has a high first pass effect. * Chlorpromazine binds D3 with the highest affinity, but also binds D1, D2, D4 and D5 Chemical Structure of typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine * Clopenthixol * Droperidol is used as an antipsychotic and antiemetic. * Haloperidol binds D2, D3 and D4 with the highest affinity, but also binds D1 and D5. * Fluphenazine binds D2 and D3 with the highest affinity but D1 and D5 as well * Flupenthixol binds D1, D2, D3, and D5 and is also used as an antidepressant. * Fluspirilene * Penfluridol * Perazine * Perphenazine * Pimozide binds D2 and D3 with high affinity, also binds D4 receptors * Spiperone binds D2, D3 and D4 with high affinity; can also bind D1 * Sulpiride binds D2 and D3 and is also used as an antidepressant. * Thioridazine binds D2, D3 and D4 with high affinity; can also bind D1 and D5 at higher concentrations =Second-generation antipsychotics (atypical)= These drugs are not only dopamine antagonists at the receptor specified, but also act on serotonin receptor 5HT2A. (Citation inappropriate) These drugs have less extrapyramidal side effects and are less likely to affect prolactin levels when compared to typical antipsychotics. * Amisulpride binds D2 and D3 and is used as an antipsychotic, antidepressant and also treats bipolar disorder. It treats both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. * Asenapine binds D2, D3 and D4 and is used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Its side effects include weight gain but there is lower risk for orthostatic hypotension, hyperprolactinemia * Aripiprazole binds D2 as a partial agonist but antagonizes D3. In addition, aripiprazole treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (mania), depression, and tic disorders Clozapine * Clozapine binds D1 and D4 with the highest affinity but still binds D2 and D3. Clozapine is unique because it is only prescribed when treatment with at least two other antipsychotics has failed due to its very harsh side effects. It also requires weekly white blood cell counts to monitor potential neutropenia. * Loxapine binds D2, D3 and D4 with high affinity; can also bind D1. Loxapine is often used to treat agitated and violent patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. * Nemonapride binds D3, D4 and D5. * Olanzapine binds all receptors and is used to treat the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder and depression. It has been associated with significant weight gain. * Quetiapine binds D1, D2 and D3 and can bind D4 at high concentrations. It is used to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. * Paliperidone binds D2, D3 and D4 with high affinity; can also bind D1 and D5. * Remoxipridebinds D2 receptors with relatively low affinity. * Risperidone binds D2, D3 and D4 receptors. Risperidone not only treats the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia but also treats bipolar disorder. * Tiapride blocks D2 and D3 and is used as an antipsychotic. It is also often used to treat dyskinesias, psychomotor agitations, tics, Huntington's chorea and alcohol dependence. * Ziprasidone blocks the D2 receptor and is used to treat schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder. There is controversy on whether Ziprasidone treats negative symptoms and it has well documented gastrointestinal side effects. =Dopamine antagonists used to treat nausea and vomiting= * Domperidone is a peripherally selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic, gastroprokinetic agent and galactagogue. * Bromopride binds enteric D2 receptors and also treats gastroparesis. * Metoclopramide also treats gastroparesis =Antagonists used only in research settings= * Eticlopride binds D2 and D3 with high affinity but also binds D4 * Nafadotride binds D2 and D3 * Raclopride binds D2 and D3 and can be radiolabeled and used in PET imaging to identify disease progression in Huntington's Disease References External links * ","title":"Dopamine antagonist"},{"id":"1389192","title":"De Bow's Review"},{"id":"1389198","text":"Horacio Llamas Grey (born July 17, 1973) is a Mexican former professional basketball player. Born in El Rosario, Sinaloa, Mexico, Llamas moved to the United States as a teenager. He played for two years at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona, where he earned Arizona Community College Athletic Conference All-Conference honors his freshman and sophomore seasons. Instead of attending an NCAA Division I college, like most NBA players, Llamas chose Division II Grand Canyon University where he earned NCAA Division II Player Of The Year honors during his senior season. He played in the Mexican league many years, he was named the Mexican national team's starting center, and he participated in such international events as the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Games, held in Ponce, Puerto Rico. When Llamas played at Pima Community College, he played well enough to make Phoenix Suns scouts feel impressed. In 1996, he was signed by the Suns. When he made his Suns debut, he made history by becoming the first Mexican to participate in an NBA game.Horacio Llamas bio . NBA.com. He chose to wear jersey number 17 which is the date of his birthday. Llamas had an impact in the Phoenix community, partly because of the large amount of Hispanics who live there. Soon after he began playing with the Suns, he was featured on the cover of the Suns' magazine, Fastbreak. Hoping to keep on bringing Hispanic fans to their home games, the Suns acquired Puerto Rico's Daniel Santiago soon after Llamas was released. Llamas played in 20 games during his debut season, scoring 34 points for an average of 1.7 points per game, with 18 rebounds for 0.9 rebounds per game and 4 assists, for 0.2 assists per game. He made his NBA debut at Reunion Arena against Dallas on March 2, 1997 just after signing for the Suns and played 4 minutes, scoring on his only attempt in a 109-108 win and played in most of the games left that season. His first career start saw him play a career best 24 minutes with 6 points, 4 reb, 1 ast and 1 stl in a 109-96 home win over the Houston Rockets. In the 1997-98, he played in eight games, three games in November, one game in February and four games in April, scoring 24 points for a total of 3.0 points per game, with 18 rebounds for a total of 2.3 rebounds per game, and 1 assist, for 0.1 assists per game and never saw any more than 8 minutes on the court. He had an NBA career best 7 points including a 3-pointer in his final game for the Suns in a 123-93 thrashing at Houston in the final game of the regular season. After 28 games in two seasons with the Suns, Llamas was released after the 97-98 season. His production totals may have been adversely affected by his not playing many minutes as a member of the Suns: in his 28 games, he only saw action a total of 143 minutes, for an average of 5 minutes played per game. On the other hand, local newspapers reported during his stint that his conditioning was said to be poor, at least initially. Llamas continued on playing basketball, playing in various international leagues as well as in the Mexican league. In 2004, Llamas tried to make a comeback to the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks had Santiago playing at center, however, and they decided not to sign Llamas. Horacio Llamas ended his career with the Pioneros de Quintana Roo in the Mexican Basketball League. He then became an assistant coach with the team. He also now volunteers in school and helps out with dreams and courage and basketball.¬°Triunfal vuelo de Halcones Rojos!

Biography J.D.B. De Bow was born on July 20, 1820 in Charleston, South Carolina, the second son of Mary Bridget Norton and Garret De Bow. James' father, Garret, was born in New York City, New York about 1775 to a Dutch-Huguenot father who immigrated to the United States at an unknown date. His mother, Mary Bridget, was born into an elite planter family from South Carolina. Her grandfather was Capt. John Norton, an early settler on the Carolina Coast. Her father, William, was a Revolutionary Soldier. A resident of New Orleans, De Bow used his magazine to advocate the expansion of Southern agriculture and commerce so that the Southern economy could become independent of the North. He warned constantly of the South's \\"colonial\\" relationship with the North, one in which the South was at a distinct disadvantage. De Bow became nationally known for an editorial he penned about the status of the territory obtained from the Mexican Cession of 1848. He claimed that the federal Union could collapse once the North's number of representatives exceeded those of the Southern states in the United States House of Representatives. Moreover, one additional free state at the time would have tipped the balance in the United States Senate to the North, which had the large majority of the population. De Bow hence proposed a legislative compromise to guarantee Southern rights in a Northern-majority Union. U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky took up the cause and cemented together a five- part Compromise of 1850, which permitted the admission of California into the Union as a free state. However, Southerners were given a concession: a stronger Fugitive Slave Law, contrary to the Constitution. De Bow later opposed the fugitive slave measure on the grounds that runaway slaves could likely gain freedom in the North from sympathetic anti-slavery juries for reasons including that slavery was unconstitutional and/or that no laws authorized slavery (cf. jury nullification). Johanna Nicol Shields and Eric H. Walther. The Fire-Eaters. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1992. On January 2, 1861, De Bow joined fellow Fire-Eater Lieutenant Governor H. M. Hyams at the Orleans Theatre in urging immediate Southern secession from the Union. Some of the speeches were delivered in French because of the Creole members of the audience. Voters went to the polls five days later to choose delegates to a state convention to consider secession. The secessionists prevailed by an eight-to-five margin. Two days after that election, Louisiana proceeded to seize the federal arsenal at Baton Rouge.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , p. 9 Among authors who contributed to De Bow's Review was the Southern surgeon and medical writer Samuel A. Cartwright, who was an authority on the establishment of sanitary conditions and also an advocate of the pro-slavery argument. In 1866, he became the first president of the proposed Tennessee and Pacific Railroad, a business venture that he would not live to see fulfilled. Less than a year later, De Bow died of peritonitis, which he contracted on a trip to visit his brother in New Jersey.

Named the Edition Manager in developer documentation, it extended the existing cut and paste editing model with a notification system; \\"subscribers\\" could include parts of \\"published\\" documents within themselves, and changes to the original published document would be noticed and updated by the subscribers. To the user the system was very similar to cut and paste in concept; material would be selected from the source document and published, creating an edition file, then placed into the subscriber by selecting that clipping file and positioning it inside the document. In general terms the concept was very similar to Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding 1.0 system. Unlike OLE, the Edition Manager was comparatively complex from a programming standpoint. Suffering from second system effect, it included features intended to make it better than OLE, including support for non- rectangular areas, network notifications and an extensive user interface. A result of this complexity was poor uptake among developers, and applications providing Publish and Subscribe were few and far between. One of the few products to use it effectively was Claris's suite of software, including ClarisWorks which had already built a system somewhat similar in concept, but required extensive changes to make its own system work with OpenDoc. At the time many in the industry felt that the Publish and Subscribe concept was the \\"next big thing\\". Apple and Microsoft were not the only two companies trying to introduce such a system; most major software vendors attempted to introduce similar systems, and NeXTSTEP included a version. However users did not find the system useful. Further it was sometimes confusing to use; if the document included live links it was no longer possible to simply copy it to a floppy disk (for instance), the clipping file had to be copied as well. In addition, opening their applications to new component developers who would compete to provide the best editors was not attractive to large corporations such as Microsoft and Adobe.

Sigourney was laid down on 7 December 1942 by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine, launched on 24 April 1943, sponsored by Miss Amy C. Olney; and commissioned on 29 June 1943, Commander W. L. Dyer in command.  World War II  The destroyer underwent shakedown training in Casco Bay, Maine, and in the Bermuda operating area. After post-shakedown repairs, Sigourney sailed, on 14 September 1943, from Norfolk with cruiser Baltimore (CA-68) en route to the west coast. They arrived at San Diego on 3 October, and the DD departed the next day for Pearl Harbor. She was routed onward to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. The ship arrived on 25 October at Port Vila and then at Espiritu Santo on 26 October, where she was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 22 (DesRon 22), Destroyer Division 44 (DesDiv 44). = Southwest Pacific campaigns = Staging was then in progress for the invasion of Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands. Sigourney escorted the transports of the assault phase to the landing area and then participated in the preliminary bombardment of the landing beaches on 1 November 1943. The ship was under air attack but suffered no damage while splashing two enemy planes. Sigourney then participated in resupply operations, with Task Force 31 (TF 31), from Tulagi to the beachhead. On the morning of 17 November, the destroyer was escorting a convoy to Empress Augusta Bay when it was attacked by Japanese planes. The convoy was illuminated by flares and torpedo planes began their runs. The high speed transport, (APD-5), was struck by a torpedo and began to burn furiously. Sigourney and Talbot (DD-114) were alongside for approximately two hours trying to rescue survivors. Sigourney rescued 34 but as the two destroyers were illuminated by the burning transport, they were under constant air attack. Neither was damaged, and Sigourney splashed two of the planes. On 10 December, Sigourney was damaged when she ran aground near Koiare, Bougainville. Sigourney and her squadron continued operations with TF 31 until 6 May 1944. The destroyer participated in antisubmarine sweeps, barge hunts, and in combined operations with PT boats and supporting aircraft. In February 1944, the destroyer was a unit in the Green Islands Attack Group which landed New Zealand troops there on the 15th. On the night of 29 February-1 March, Sigourney, with DesRon 22, engaged in an antishipping sweep of Simpson Harbor and then bombarded Rabaul and the airfield on Duke of York Island in the Bismarck Archipelago. During March, Sigourney and her destroyer division operated under the direction of the Commanding General, U.S. XVI Corps, in support of forces on Bougainville. They provided counter-battery fire, bombarded enemy troops and installations ashore, and performed fire support as requested. Sigourney engaged in daily bombardments in the Jaba River and Motapena Point area and supported PT boat operations at night. On 12 March alone, Sigourney and Eaton (DD-510) fired 400 rounds of call fire in support of the 37th Infantry Division perimeter. In mid-March, Sigourney was called upon to support the landing of the 4th Marine Regiment at Emirau, St. Matthias Group. She then returned to bombard pill boxes and entrenchments east of the Torokina River, Bougainville, until 12 April. Sigourney then made escort trips between Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Purvis Bay, Majuro, Eniwetok and Kwajalein. On 11 May, the destroyer sortied from Kwajalein with Task Group 51.18 (TG 51.18), the Joint Expeditionary Force, Reserve, for the amphibious assault on Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands. Sigourney arrived off Saipan, on 16 June, and participated in operations there and on Tinian until she withdrew from the operations area on 20 August. During her time on station, she bombarded beaches on both islands, supplied call-fire support for the forces ashore, and served as a picket ship and as an antisubmarine screen. When Sigourney was released from the Mariana Islands campaign, she sailed for Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, arriving on 25 August. There, she was attached to TF 32 which sortied on 8 September for the Palau Islands operation. From 15 to 30 September, the destroyer worked in conjunction with the aircraft carriers which launched attacks in support of the amphibious assault on Peleliu. Sigourney was in Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, from 3 to 12 October. Then she got underway for Leyte, Philippines, with TG 77.2, the Bombardment and Fire Support Group. = Philippines campaigns = On the 19 October 1944, Sigourney shelled Red and White Beaches to cover underwater demolition teams reconnoitering the landing sites near Dulag and Tacloban. She and Cony (DD-508) remained in the area while the remainder of TG 77.2 withdrew to the south to cover the approaches to the Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. The two destroyers fired night harassing and interdiction fire on beaches, roads, and installations. On the 20th, they bombarded the beaches until H-hour and then provided call-fire support until the 24th when word was received from the Commander, 7th Fleet, to prepare for a night engagement. Sigourney, Aulick (DD-569), and Welles (DD-628) were in the van as Attack Section 2 of DesDiv \\"X-Ray\\" which would screen the battle line consisting of six battleships. In the screening position, they did not take part in the torpedo attacks on the Japanese fleet launched by other American destroyers. On 29 October, Sigourney withdrew from Leyte and returned to Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 3 November. Nine days later, the destroyer was en route back to Leyte Gulf. She performed screening assignments and radar picket duties at the entrance to the gulf off Dinagat Island from 6 to 30 November. On the night of 1-2 December, DesDiv 44 made a sweep of the Camotes Sea. At 02:38 on 2 December, Sigourney and Conway (DD-507) opened fire on a Japanese freighter which sank six minutes later. The destroyers then steamed for the Palau Islands to join the covering force for the invasion of Mindoro. The task group of four battleships, four cruisers, six escort carriers, and 18 destroyers sailed on the 10th. Three days later, the carriers began launching air attacks which continued until 17 December. During the time in the area, the task group was under constant enemy air attack. Sigourney next joined TG 79.2 (Attack Group Baker) which was formed at Manus Island and sortied from there on 31 December 1944 en route to the Philippine Islands. On 9 January 1945, the task group landed elements of the U.S. 6th Army in the Lingayen area of Luzon Island. On the 20th, Sigourney and Saufley (DD-465) left to screen Australian Transport Division 21 to Morotai, N.E.I. The destroyer escorted convoys between Leyte and Lingayen Gulfs until 27 February when she sailed with Task Unit 78.2.12 (TU 78.2.12) for Puerto Princesa, Palawan Island, to support the landings there on the 28th by United States Army troops. Still conducting operations in the Philippine Islands during April, Sigourney operated with TG 74.2 prior to, and during the army assault on the Malabang, Parang, and Cotabato areas of Mindanao on 17 April. On 6 May, the destroyer sailed from the Philippine Islands for the United States via the Marshall Islands and Pearl Harbor. Sigourney arrived at San Pedro, Calif., on 31 May and entered the Bethlehem Steel Co. Shipyard for an overhaul, remaining there until 3 September. She moved to San Diego the next day and, a month later was underway, for New York City via the Panama Canal, arriving there on 20 October. In October, the destroyer was ordered to Charleston, S.C., to prepare for inactivation. On 20 March 1946, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  1951 ‚Äì 1960  Sigourney was placed in full commission again on 7 September 1951 at Charleston, S.C. She underwent shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay in early 1952 and, in April, joined DesRon 322 with Norfolk as her home port. She conducted local operations from there until October when she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which lasted until January 1953. She returned to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training until March, after which she operated out of her home port. On 29 June, Sigourney began a combined seven- month Far East tour and round-the-world cruise. While in Korean waters, the destroyer was attached to TF 77, the Fast Carrier Force, and TF 95, the United Nations Blockading and Escort Force. Sigourney refueling from in the Med, 1957. On 10 December 1953, Sigourney began her goodwill cruise which took her to Hong Kong, Singapore, Naples, Cannes, Gibraltar, and Lisbon before returning to Norfolk on 6 February 1954. In June, she took a Midshipman cruise to France and Spain before returning to her home port in August. The destroyer was overhauled from October 1954 until January 1955. Sigourney made a cruise to Europe with DesDiv 322 in 1955, Midshipman cruises to Europe in 1956 and 1958, and was deployed with the 6th Fleet in 1957. On 1 January 1959, her home port was changed to Philadelphia, and she became part of the Reserve Training Fleet. On 1 May 1960, she was placed in reserve out of commission, with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and berthed at Philadelphia. Sigourney was stricken 1 December 1974, sold 31 July 1975 and broken up for scrap.  Awards  Sigourney received nine battle stars for World War II service. In popular culture The Sigourney appeared in the movie \\"Away All Boats\\", accurately depicting the Fletcher destroyer class's anti-aircraft role in the Pacific Theater.

Before helicopter decks became common, warships such as the often had a deck at the stern used for secondary armament. Seaplanes were often operated from the quarterdeck of battleships, as here on A model of the richly decorated stern and quarterdeck of , a sailing warship built in the late 1620s Quarterdeck of a Japanese warship. Note the watchstanders in uniform, the wooden plaque, and the proximity to the accommodation ladder. The quarterdeck is a raised deck behind the main mast of a sailing ship. Traditionally it was where the captain commanded his vessel and where the ship's colours were kept. This led to its use as the main ceremonial and reception area on board, and the word is still used to refer to such an area on a ship or even in naval establishments on land. Many such facilities have areas decorated like shipboard quarterdecks. In the 20th century the word came to be applied to the area at the stern of the ship, often (on naval vessels) used for secondary weapons and (on battleships) seaplane catapults. In modern military designs the stern has been roofed over by the helicopter deck but a large space remains underneath which is typically used for sonar equipment or small boats and which is still referred to as the quarterdeck in Commonwealth navies. Ceremonial use There are ancient traditions of offering special deference to the quarterdeck. Greek, Roman, and Carthaginian warships all carried shrines which were given special respect. This continued into Christian times, and in medieval British warships, the religious shrine was set up on the quarterdeck. All hands were required to salute it by taking off their hats or caps. This led to the habit of saluting whenever one entered the quarterdeck. Today, quarterdeck refers not to a specific deck, but to a ceremonial area designated as such by the captain, often used as the ship's reception area while in harbour. As in the days of sail, it is a place where the captain has special control and prerogatives. In port, the quarterdeck is the most important place on the ship, and is the central control point for all its major activities, as well as it is where the captain usually stands. Underway, its importance diminishes as control of the ship is transferred to the bridge. The quarterdeck is normally on the main deck, but may be elsewhere in some types of ship. It is usually marked off by special lines, deck markings, decorative cartridge cases, or fancy knotwork. Special attention is paid to the quarterdeck's cleanliness and physical appearance. Those standing watch on the quarterdeck must be in the uniform of the day and present a smart appearance at all times. Personnel not in the uniform of the day generally avoid crossing the quarterdeck unless their work requires it. On ships with a well-defined quarterdeck area, uniformed personnel should salute when they enter it. Smoking and recreational activities are prohibited on the quarterdeck unless specially authorised by the commanding officer. The starboard gangway to the quarterdeck is normally used by officers and their visitors; the port gangway is used by everyone else. In bad weather, all personnel use the lee gangway. On smaller ships with only one gangway, it may be rigged to either side and is used by everyone. Flagships sometimes have an additional starboard gangway for the flag officer and officers of his staff. History In Medieval times, warships had a single deck, with raised structures (the \\"forecastle\\" and \\"sterncastle\\") at each end. Following the introduction of cannon, the sterncastle was gradually replaced with a simpler structure consisting of the halfdeck above the main deck, extending forwards from the stern to the mainmast; and above that the quarterdeck, extending about half as far forwards. Later the halfdeck was extended the entire length of the ship, becoming the main deck (the former main deck now being the gun deck), leaving the quarterdeck as the only significant deck above the main deck. The captain or master commanded the ship from the quarterdeck. The quarterdeck was traditionally the place where the captain walked when on deck, usually on the windward side. The navigator also used it when taking his sights when fixing the vessel's position. On most ships, it was customary that only officers could use the quarterdeck, others being allowed there only when assigned for specific duties. By extension, on flush-decked ships the after part of the main deck, where the officers took their station, was also known as the quarterdeck. As powered ships came into use, the term was applied to the same approximate area of the ship (although the officers stations were moved to the bridge). It came to be applied to the area at the stern of the ship, sometimes a separate stepped deck, often used for secondary weapons and (on battleships) seaplane catapults. In modern designs the stern has been roofed over by the helicopter deck but a large space remains underneath which is typically used for sonar equipment and small boats and which is still referred to as the quarterdeck in Commonwealth navies. has an example of British usage. Scouting In Sea Scouts, quarterdeck training is introductory training for youth to equip them with leadership and management abilities to effectively run their ship.http://www.scouting.org/filestore/training/pdf/ILSSSyllabus.pdf See also *Deck (ship) References Nautical terminology Ship compartments Shipbuilding ","title":"Quarterdeck"},{"id":"1389227","text":"Lepsius is a German surname, and may refer to: *Johannes Lepsius, humanitarian *Karl Richard Lepsius, Egyptologist *Reinhold Lepsius, painter *Sabine Lepsius, painter See also *55733 Lepsius, asteroid ","title":"Lepsius"},{"id":"1389233","text":"Train station at Volta Grande Volta Grande is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Minas Gerais.

This condition is also called rapid gastric emptying. It is mostly associated with conditions following gastric or esophageal surgery, though it can also arise secondary to diabetes or to the use of certain medications; it is caused by an absent or insufficiently functioning pyloric sphincter, the valve between the stomach and the duodenum. Dumping syndrome has two forms, based on when symptoms occur. Early dumping syndrome occurs 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. It results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach. The small intestine expands rapidly due to the presence of hypertonic/hyperosmolar contents from the stomach, especially sweet foods. This causes symptoms due to the shift of fluid into the intestinal lumen, with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Osmotic diarrhea, distension of the small bowel leading to crampy abdominal pain, and reduced blood volume can result. Late dumping syndrome occurs 2 to 3 hours after a meal. It results from excessive movement of sugar into the intestine, which raises the body's blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin. The increased release of insulin causes a rapid drop in blood glucose levels, a condition known as alimentary hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of early and late dumping syndrome are different and vary from person to person. Early dumping syndrome symptoms may include: * nausea * vomiting * abdominal pain and cramping * diarrhea * feeling uncomfortably full or bloated after a meal * sweating * weakness * dizziness * flushing, or blushing of the face or skin * rapid or irregular heartbeat The symptoms of late dumping syndrome may include: * hypoglycemia * flushing About 75 percent of people with dumping syndrome report symptoms of early dumping syndrome and about 25 percent report symptoms of late dumping syndrome. Some people have symptoms of both types of dumping syndrome. Diagnosis A health care provider will diagnose dumping syndrome primarily on the basis of symptoms. The following tests may also help confirm dumping syndrome and exclude other conditions with similar symptoms: * A modified oral glucose tolerance test checks how well insulin works with tissues to absorb glucose. A health care provider often confirms dumping syndrome in people with: ** low blood sugar between 120 and 180 minutes after drinking the solution ** an increase in hematocrit of more than 3 percent at 30 minutes ** a rise in pulse rate of more than 10 beats per minute after 30 minutes * A gastric emptying scintigraphy test involves eating a bland meal that contains a small amount of radioactive material. An external camera scans the abdomen to locate the radioactive material. The radiologist measures the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. The test can help confirm a diagnosis of dumping syndrome. The health care provider may also examine the structure of the esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestine with the following tests: * An upper GI endoscopy to see the upper GI tract. A gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. * An upper GI series examines the small intestine. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of a blockage or other complications of gastric surgery show up more clearly on x rays. Treatment Treatment for dumping syndrome includes changes in eating, diet, and nutrition; medication; and, in some cases, surgery. Many people with dumping syndrome have mild symptoms that improve over time with simple dietary changes. =Lifestyle changes= The first step to minimizing symptoms of dumping syndrome involves changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, and may include * eating five or six small meals a day instead of three larger meals * delaying liquid intake until at least 30 minutes after a meal * increasing intake of protein, fiber, and complex carbohydrates‚Äîfound in starchy foods such as oatmeal and rice * avoiding simple sugars such as table sugar, which can be found in candy, syrup, sodas, and juice beverages * increasing the thickness of food by adding pectin or guar gum‚Äîplant extracts used as thickening agents Some people find that lying down for 30 minutes after meals also helps reduce symptoms, though some health care providers advise against this. =Medication= A health care provider may prescribe octreotide acetate injections to treat dumping syndrome symptoms. The medication works by slowing gastric emptying and inhibiting the release of insulin and other GI hormones. =Surgery= A person may need surgery if dumping syndrome is caused by previous gastric surgery or if the condition is not responsive to other treatments. For most people, the type of surgery depends on the type of gastric surgery performed previously. However, surgery to correct dumping syndrome often has unsuccessful results.

Early life Born as Margaret Dudley, her father was James John Dudley. Life as Mrs. Childers Childers met her husband, a widower who was also a senior member of Fianna F√°il, while working as an attach√© for the British Embassy in Dublin. The couple's mixed marriage (Erskine Hamilton Childers was an Anglican, she a Roman Catholic) caused some controversy; the then Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid tried to discourage them from marrying. They eventually opted to marry in Paris. McQuaid reportedly later apologised to the couple for his behaviour. Erskine was elected President of Ireland in June 1973, but died suddenly in November 1974. The political parties secretly agreed a deal to make Mrs Childers the new president. However, a political dispute in which a partially deaf Fine Gael minister in the National Coalition government, Tom O'Donnell, misheard a journalist's question about Mrs Childers and confirmed that she would be the next president led the plan to collapse. Her late husband's political party, Fianna F√°il, withdrew its support for her and instead proposed former Chief Justice Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh. √ì D√°laigh was eventually elected unopposed as the joint nominee of the government and main opposition parties in the presidential election of 1974.

The Post had more newspaper names registered and after some deliberation it was decided to go with The Sowetan. This was a weekly, Saturday and Sunday paper. The latter was later closed as it was never financially viable. The Sowetan never was a free sheet as it was never published before this date. The name was registered at the time with the intention to publish at a rather huge cost. It was one of more titles registered as a backup at the time. Sales in the beginning were slow because people wrongly assumed that The Sowetan had only news from Soweto. It was in fact a countrywide newspaper from the beginning and was distributed in the Transvaal, Natal, Orange Free State, with copies also going to Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Due to the poor sales and high costs, the Port Elizabeth and Cape Town distribution was stopped after a few years. It took nearly two years before it was accepted and sales started soaring. Percy Qoboza was the editor at the time but was soon replaced by Joe Latakgomo. Latagomo started as a sports editor in 1967. Later Latakgomo left and joined The Star, after receiving death threats, and was replaced by Aggrey Klaaste, who was editor from 1988 to 2002.

It is based on Thomas Eidson's 1996 novel The Last Ride. The film is set in 1885 New Mexico Territory and is notable for the authentic use of the Apache language by various actors, some of whom spent long hours studying it. The film was produced by Revolution Studios, Imagine Entertainment, and Daniel Ostroff Productions and distributed by Columbia Pictures (Sony Pictures Releasing). Plot In late 19th-century New Mexico, Samuel Jones reappears hoping to reconcile with his adult daughter Magdalena \\"Maggie\\" Gilkeson. She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when renegade Apache Pesh-Chidin, alias El Brujo, and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. The U.S. Cavalry refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive Native Americans. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a Chiricahua, and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (\\"shit for luck\\") during his wanderings. It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths. Maggie shoots at the last remaining kidnappers to scare them off. She realizes her father's love for her and finally forgives him. Then she goes home with her father's body, her daughters and the other kidnapped girls. Cast Reception The film earned mixed reviews from critics, earning it a 58% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the general consensus being: \\"An expertly acted and directed Western. But like other Ron Howard features, the movie is hardly subtle.\\" Philip French of The Observer referred to the film as Howard's \\"finest film to date,\\" and Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune called it the \\"best and toughest western since Unforgiven.\\" The Missing was well received among Native American populations within the United States, many of them citing the use of the Apache language to be clearly spoken and well understood. Actors such as Tommy Lee Jones, Jay Tavare, Simon R. Baker, and others had to learn to speak some dialogue in the Chiricahua dialect of the Apache language that was used throughout the film. Tavare has noted that there are only about 300 people still fluent in Chiricahua today, and following screenings of the film, Native American students said the film helped stimulate pride through its authenticity. The Missing grossed $27 million domestically and $11.4 million internationally for a worldwide total of $38.4 million.

The MƒÅori monarch operates in a non-constitutional capacity with no legal or judicial power within the New Zealand government. Reigning monarchs retain the position of paramount chief of several tribes (iwi) and wield some power over these, especially within Tainui. The current MƒÅori monarch, T≈´heitia Paki, was elected in 2006 and his official residence is T≈´rongo House at T≈´rangawaewae marae in the town of NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. T≈´heitia is the seventh monarch since the position was created and is the continuation of a dynasty that reaches back to the inaugural king, P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero. The movement arose among a group of central North Island iwi in the 1850s as a means of attaining MƒÅori unity to halt the alienation of land at a time of rapid population growth by European colonists. The movement sought to establish a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria and thus allow MƒÅori to deal with PƒÅkehƒÅ (Europeans) on equal footing. It took on the appearance of an alternative government with its own flag, newspaper, bank, councillors, magistrates and law enforcement. But it was viewed by the colonial government as a challenge to the supremacy of the British monarchy, leading in turn to the 1863 invasion of Waikato, which was partly motivated by a drive to neutralise the Kƒ´ngitanga's power and influence. Following their defeat at ≈årƒÅkau in 1864, Kƒ´ngitanga forces withdrew into the NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribal region of the North Island that became known as the King Country.  History  =Background= The flag hoisted at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia on the proclamation of P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero as MƒÅori King, drawn in 1863 173x173pxFrom the early 1850s, North Island MƒÅori came under increasing pressure to satisfy the demand of European settler farmers for arable land. While MƒÅori cultivated small areas, relying on extensive forests for berry, birds and roots, settlers expanded their production capacity by burning forest and fern and planting grass seed in the ashes. Some influential chiefs including Te Rauparaha opposed land sales in the 1840s (culminating in the 1843 Wairau Affray), and the view became more widespread in the following decade, when the PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) population grew to outnumber MƒÅori and the colonial government's Native Land Purchase Department adopted unscrupulous methods to take ownership, which included offers to chiefs or small groups of owners. Deals with individual MƒÅori or groups that did not represent majority interests also dragged MƒÅori into disputes with one another. As the white frontier encroached further on their land, many became concerned that their land, and race, would soon be overrun. From about 1853 MƒÅori began reviving the ancient tribal runanga or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting‚Äîattracting as many as 2000 MƒÅori leaders‚Äîwas held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land. The meetings provided an important forum for Te Rauparaha's son, Christian convert Tamihana Te Rauparaha, who in 1851 had visited England where he was presented to Queen Victoria. Tamihana Te Rauparaha had returned to New Zealand with the idea of forming a MƒÅori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes, and used the runanga to secure the agreement of influential North Island chiefs to his idea. The kotahitanga or unity movement was aimed at bringing to MƒÅori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans. It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, MƒÅori would be able to deal with PƒÅkehƒÅ on equal footing. It was also intended to establish a system of law and order in MƒÅori communities to which the Auckland government had so far shown little interest. A Bible is traditionally used during the crowning of a monarch. =P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero= The first MƒÅori King, P≈çtatau Te WherowheroSeveral North Island candidates who were asked to put themselves forward declined; in February 1857, a few weeks after a key intertribal meeting in Taup≈ç, Wiremu Tamihana, a chief of the NgƒÅti HauƒÅ iwi in eastern Waikato, circulated a proposal to appoint as king the elderly and high-ranking Waikato chief Te Wherowhero and a major meeting was organised for Rangiriri in April to deal with it. After initially declining‚Äîhe was unwilling to undertake new ventures at his age and was described by a European visitor as blind and decrepit, \\"on the very brink of his grave\\"German geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter in Neuseeland (Stuttgart: 1867); pg. 456, cited in King.‚ÄîTe Wherowhero agreed in September 1857 to accept the kingship and in June 1858 he was crowned at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, later adopting the name P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero or simply P≈çtatau. In his acceptance speech P≈çtatau stressed the spirit of unity symbolised by the kingship and called on his people to \\"hold fast to love, to the law, and to faith in God.\\" Over time the King Movement came to have a flag, a council of state, a code of laws, a \\"King's Resident Magistrate\\", police, a surveyor and a newspaper, Te Hokioi, all of which gave the movement the appearance of an alternative government. The lives of his followers were given new purpose with the lawmaking, trials, and lengthy meetings and debates. Historian Michael King noted: \\"In the eyes of his supporters, the chiefs who had raised him up had made him a repository for their own mana and tapu and for that of their lands. P≈çtatau was now a man of intensified prestige and sacredness. This belief was to impel people to go to heroic lengths to uphold the kingship and, subsequently, to fight for it.\\" P≈çtatau proclaimed the boundary separating his authority from that of the Governor, saying: \\"Let Maungatautari be our boundary. Do not encroach on this side. Likewise I am not to set foot on that side.\\" The King envisaged a conjoint administration in which he ruled in territory still under MƒÅori customary title while the Governor ruled in areas acquired by the Crown. Governor Thomas Gore Browne had been watching developments with concern. In June 1857 he wrote to London that \\"I apprehend no sort of danger from the present movement, but it is evident that the establishment of a separate nationality by the Maoris in any form or shape if persevered in would end sooner or later in collision.\\" Though there were still no signs the movement was developing an aggressive spirit, Browne soon began expressing his fear that \\"it will resolve into a conflict of race and become the greatest political difficulty we have had to contend with\\". 300x300pxRecognition of the new King, however, was not immediate: though there was widespread respect for the movement's efforts in establishing a \\"land league\\" to slow land sales, P≈çtatau's role was strongly embraced only by Waikato MƒÅori, with iwi of North Auckland and south of Waikato showing him scant recognition. Some opponents dismissed the Kƒ´ngitanga as a solely Waikato movement. Throughout 1859 emissaries of the King Movement travelled through the North Island, including Taranaki, Wanganui and Hawkes Bay, seeking further adherents, with iwi sometimes divided in their support. Even within the movement there was said to be deep division: historian Keith Sinclair claimed \\"moderates\\" aligned themselves with Wiremu Tamihana and \\"anti-European extremists\\" followed NgƒÅti Maniapoto chief and warlord Rewi Maniapoto, although Belich and historian Vincent O'Malley dispute this, saying both factions were driven by shared objectives and concerns and that divisions had been exaggerated by historians. Tribal rivalries may also have weakened unity. Historian B.J. Dalton observed: \\"Outside the Waikato, the King Movement appealed most to the younger generation who could see no other way of gaining the mana their fathers had won in battle.\\" On 10 April 1860, three weeks after the start of the Taranaki wars, deputations from west coast tribes Te ƒÄti Awa and NgƒÅ Ruanui attended a gathering of Waikato MƒÅori at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia and tendered their formal allegiance to the king. Discussions at that meeting, and at a second meeting at Peria six weeks later that attracted a large group of supporters from the lower Waikato, centered on hostilities in Taranaki and the question of whether the King Movement should intervene. A faction of moderates within the movement swung the decision against direct involvement, but news of the meetings led to panic in Auckland over the possibility of a MƒÅori attack on the capital, in turn prompting what Dalton described as \\"a mood of savage vindictiveness towards all MƒÅori\\". In late June 1860 large numbers of Waikato MƒÅori travelled to Taranaki to reinforce Te ƒÄti Awa chief Wiremu Kƒ´ngi's forces and joined in the plunder of abandoned farms, but the intervention was unorganised and on a limited scale, relieving Taranaki settlers of some fear of full-scale Kƒ´ngitanga involvement. P≈çtatau died of influenza on 25 June 1860 and was succeeded by his son, Matutaera TƒÅwhiao. =Matutaera TƒÅwhiao= TƒÅwhiao, the second MƒÅori King (1860‚Äì1894) TƒÅwhiao's succession to the position of King coincided with a period of increasing friction between MƒÅori and the Auckland-based settler government over issues of land ownership and sovereignty. Hostilities surrounding land purchases in Taranaki spread, erupting into a series of conflicts that became known as the New Zealand Wars. Tamihana, a strategist revered as the \\"kingmaker\\", expressed the Kƒ´ngitanga movement's key concern in a letter to Browne at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861. He said Waikato tribes had never signed the Treaty of Waitangi and that MƒÅori were a separate nation. \\"I do not desire to cast the Queen from this island, but from own piece (of land). I am to be the person to overlook my own piece,\\" he wrote. But Browne regarded the Kƒ´ngitanga stance as an act of disloyalty; his plans for the invasion of Waikato were fuelled in large part by his desire to uphold \\"the Queen's supremacy\\" in the face of the Kƒ´ngitanga challenge. Browne's successor, Sir George Grey, told a large MƒÅori gathering at Taupari near the mouth of the Waikato River in December 1861 that the King movement was bad and should be abandoned. On 9 July 1863 Grey issued an ultimatum that all MƒÅori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River. Troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later to begin their invasion. Kƒ´ngitanga forces were forced to fight a defensive war based on frustrating and slowing down their enemy but were unable to prevail over a full-time professional army with almost unlimited manpower and firepower. TƒÅwhiao and his close followers fled into the bush and steep limestone valleys of Maniapoto territory, which was subsequently known as the King Country, declaring that Europeans risked death if they crossed the aukati or boundary of the confiscated land. Governor Grey, meanwhile, began steering through Parliament legislation for the widespread seizure of the land of \\"rebel\\" MƒÅori. The confiscation of 486,500 hectares of land, including fertile areas under cultivation, burial sites and areas that had been inhabited for centuries, was a bitter blow for Waikato MƒÅori. In 1869 and 1870 TƒÅwhiao was challenged by Ringat≈´ prophet and guerrilla leader Te Kooti to resume hostilities against the government to try to wrest back the confiscated land. Tawhiao, however, had renounced war and declared 1867‚Äì68 as the \\"year of the lamb\\" and \\"year of peace\\"; in April 1869 he had issued another proclamation that \\"the slaying of man by man is to cease\\". Though there were radical elements in the Kƒ´ngitanga movement who favoured a resumption of war, including Rewi Maniapoto and possibly TƒÅwhiao himself, moderates continued to warn the King that they had little chance of success and risked annihilation by becoming involved in Te Kooti's actions. TƒÅwhiao remained in exile for 20 years, wandering through Maniapoto and Taranaki settlements, adopting an Old Testament view of himself as an anointed leader of a chosen people wandering in the wilderness awaiting a deliverance into their inheritance. Masthead from 179x179pxFrom the 1870s the Government‚Äîkeen to push a north‚Äìsouth railway link through the centre of the North Island and open up the King Country to more settlers‚Äîbegan making approaches to TƒÅwhiao to offer peace terms. Grey, by now Premier of New Zealand, visited the King in May 1878 to offer him \\"lands on the left bank of the Waipa, 500 acres at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, land in all the townships\\" as well as economic aid and rights over roads and land dealings. TƒÅwhiao refused the offer. Three years later, in July 1881, he summoned Resident Magistrate William Gilbert Mair to a meeting at Alexandra (today known as Pirongia) where he and 70 followers laid down their guns, then laid alongside them 70 roasted pigeons and a fantail, explaining, \\"This means peace.\\" He travelled to London in 1884 with Western Maori MP Wiremu Te Wheoro to lead a deputation with a petition to the Crown about MƒÅori land grievances but was refused an audience with the Queen. Back in New Zealand in 1886 and seeking MƒÅori solutions to MƒÅori problems through MƒÅori institutions, he petitioned Native Minister John Ballance for the establishment of a MƒÅori Council \\"for all the chiefs of this Island\\". When this proposal, too, was ignored, he set up his own Kauhanganui, a Kƒ´ngitanga parliament, at Maungakawa in 1892. Though all North Island iwi were invited to attend, participation was confined mainly to the Waikato, Maniapoto and Hauraki people who were already part of the King Movement. The assembly's discussions included proceedings in the national Parliament, interpretations of the Treaty of Waitangi, the confiscation issue and conditions for land sales, but its deliberations and recommendations were either ignored or derided by the Parliament and public servants. The establishment of TƒÅwhiao's Kauhanganui coincided with the formation of a MƒÅori Parliament at Waipatu Marae in Heretaunga. This parliament, which consisted of 96 members from the North and South Islands under Prime Minister HƒÅmiora MangakƒÅhia, was formed as part of the Kotahitanga (unification) Movement, which TƒÅwhiao refused to join. From about 1886 until about 1905 it also had a bank, the Bank of Aotearoa, which operated in Parawera, Maungatatauri and Maungakawa. TƒÅwhiao also instituted a system of annual poukais‚Äîvisits by the King to Kƒ´ngitanga marae, which he devised as a means of drawing people back to their marae on a fixed day each year. The poukais later evolved into regular consultation meetings between Kƒ´ngitanga leadership and its followers where funds were also raised to cover the movement's expenses and the upkeep of local marae. TƒÅwhiao died suddenly on 26 August 1894 and was succeeded by his oldest son, Mahuta TƒÅwhiao. =Mahuta TƒÅwhiao= Mahuta TƒÅwhiao, third MƒÅori king, who was crowned in 1894.Mahuta, born about 1854, was raised during the wars of the 1860s and the exile that followed, and received no European education and spoke little English. By the time of his coronation support for the King Movement had declined and its followers were limited mainly to the Tainui tribes in Waikato and NgƒÅti Maniapoto from the King Country. From the beginning of his kingship Mahuta took an interest in politics: he pressed the government for compensation for the 1860s land confiscations, sponsored a relative, Henare Kaihau, for the Western Maori electorate and from the late 1890s made frequent contact with Prime Minister Richard Seddon and Native Affairs Minister James Carroll, the first MƒÅori to hold a cabinet position. Mahuta was an advocate of conciliation between MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ; according to historian Michael King, Seddon took advantage of his goodwill and naivety to secure the sale of more MƒÅori land. Seddon invited Mahuta to Wellington as a member of the Legislative Council (Upper House) and to sit on the Executive Council as \\"Minister representing the Maori race\\". Despite widespread opposition from Waikato MƒÅori, who feared it was an attempt to neutralise the King Movement, Mahuta accepted and he was sworn in in May 1903. He entrusted the kingship to his younger brother Te Wherowhero Tawhiao, but resumed the kingship on 21 May 1910, disillusioned with the political process in dealing with MƒÅori confiscation claims. Throughout Mahuta's years as king, Waikato was mired in economic and social depression. Many MƒÅori were landless and destitute because of confiscations, while those who did still own land were unable to make it productive. The area had severe health problems, with constant bouts of typhoid epidemics, influenza, measles and whooping cough. Sanitary conditions were generally poor, unemployment high, drunkenness widespread and child schooling rates very low. In 1911 Mahuta withdrew his backing for Kaihau in Western Maori after discovering he had presided over the loss of ¬£50,000 of Kƒ´ngitanga moneys and used his niece, Te Puea Herangi, to swing support to doctor and former Health Department medical officer Maui Pomare in that year's general election. Pomare won the seat by 565 votes. Te Puea's involvement in campaigning for Mahuta's preferred candidate marked her elevation to a position of chief organiser for the King Movement, a role she held until her death in 1952. Mahuta's health declined throughout 1912 and he died on 9 November, aged 57. =Te Rata Mahuta= Mahuta's eldest son Te Rata, then aged between 30 and 33, was crowned on 24 November 1912 by kingmaker Tupu Taingakawa. He was shy and physically weak, having long suffered rheumatism, arthritis and heart disease. With strong support from his cousin and protector Te Puea (later widely referred to as \\"Princess Te Puea\\"), he withstood a challenge to his authority by Taingakawa, who established a rival kauhanganui (assembly) at Rukumoana, near Morrinsville. Te Puea built up facilities at the Mangatawhiri pƒÅ and revived the recitation of tribal history, the singing of Waikato songs and other cultural traditions. In 1913 Taingakawa convinced Te Rata to head another delegation to England to petition the Crown to revoke the land confiscations as a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. An intertribal meeting at Raglan decided all King Movement adherents would contribute a shilling a head to cover the cost and the four-man delegation sailed from Auckland on 11 April 1914. After initially being rebuffed, they gained an audience with King George V and Queen Mary on 4 June on condition that nothing embarrassing would be raised. They departed England on 10 August, having gained nothing but the assurance their claims would be referred back to the New Zealand Government. With New Zealand already involved in World War I on Te Rata's return, the King discouraged Waikato enlistment‚Äîboth because of Tawhaio's 1881 declaration that Waikato MƒÅori would never again fight and continued resentment over the injustice of confiscation. Te Puea explained: \\"They tell us to fight for king and country. We've got a King, but we haven't got a country. That's been taken off us.\\" The war was viewed as a PƒÅkehƒÅ fight among PƒÅkehƒÅ nations. From June 1917 the Military Services Act was amended to apply conscription to all MƒÅori, though the Minister of Defence advised officials it was to apply only to Waikato MƒÅori. On 11 July 1918 police arrived at Te Paina, the King Movement's pƒÅ at Mangatawhiri, and began arresting males who had failed to report for military duty. The men were transported to Narrow Neck army training camp in Auckland, where they were repeatedly punished for refusing to dress in military uniform. At the end of the war 111 remained in confinement; they were released in May 1919. The anti-conscription stance led to the Kƒ´ngitanga Movement being widely regarded by PƒÅkehƒÅ as seditious traitors and German sympathisers and also drove a wedge between Te Puea and Pomare, who throughout the war urged all MƒÅori to fight for empire forces. Te Puea continued to strengthen her position as an organiser and spiritual leader. She pioneered efforts to care for victims of the 1918 influenza epidemic, helped Waikato MƒÅori turn previously unused land into farms and developed the movement's new spiritual and cultural home, the T≈´rangawaewae marae at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. The first hui was held there on 25 December 1921. Te Rata died on 1 October 1933. Te Puea rejected a proposal to make her the MƒÅori monarch, believing that 21-year-old Koroki, Te Rata's eldest son, was the rightful heir to the throne. =Koroki Mahuta= Koroki Mahuta, fifth MƒÅori king, who was crowned in 1933.Koroki Te Rata Mahuta TƒÅwhiao P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero was the fifth in the line of MƒÅori kings. Shy and reserved, he was crowned on 8 October 1933 at the age of about 25 and accepted the role reluctantly, protesting that with so many Waikato MƒÅori living in poverty they could not afford a king. Throughout his reign he came under the strong but conflicting influence of several opposing factions which created some controversies; he also notably lost a battle with politicians to keep King Country free of liquor licences. He hosted a brief visit by Queen Elizabeth to T≈´rangawaewae on 30 December 1953; the government refused him permission to deliver a speech in which he was to make the historic step of declaring loyalty to the British Crown, but a copy of the speech was later sent to the Queen. From the late 1950s his health began to deteriorate and he died at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia on 18 May 1966. =Te Atairangikaahu= Te Atairangikaahu, daughter of MƒÅori King Korokƒ´ Mahuta, was elected as the first MƒÅori Queen on 23 May 1966 and served until her death on 15 August 2006. In the New Year Honours 1970 Te Atairangikaahu was the first MƒÅori to be appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for \\"...outstanding services to MƒÅori people...\\".\\"New Year Honours List\\" (15 January 1970) 1 New Zealand Gazette 1 at 15. Her 40-year reign was the longest of any MƒÅori monarch. =T≈´heitia Paki= Following the death of his celebrated mother, Dame Te Atairangikaahu, T≈´heitia Paki was sworn in as the MƒÅori King on 21 August 2006. In August 2014, T≈´heitia Paki created a MƒÅori Honours System. There are three awards: the Order of King Pootatau Te Wherowhero; the Order of the Taniwhaa; and the Illustrious Order of Te Arikinui Queen Te Atairangikaahu. Succession The monarch is appointed by the leaders of the tribes involved in the Kƒ´ngitanga movement on the day of the previous monarch's funeral and before the burial. In principle the position of MƒÅori monarch is not hereditary. Thus far however, the monarchy has been hereditary in effect, as every new MƒÅori monarch has been the previous monarch's heir by cognatic primogeniture, descending in seven generations from P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero to the present MƒÅori king. With each successive monarch, the role of P≈çtatau's family has been entrenched, although after any reign ends there is the potential for the mantle to be passed to someone from another family or tribe if the chiefs of the various tribes are in agreement. Powers The Kƒ´ngitanga has been a parliamentary elected monarchy since 1890. Power is divided between the Kauhanganui, the Kƒ´ngitanga and Waikato Tainui parliament, and the standing MƒÅori monarch. The position of the MƒÅori king is mainly a highly respected ceremonial role within the Waikato Tainui tribe with limited powers. Nevertheless, the standing monarch can influence tribal policy based on their mana and is entitled to appoint one of the 11 members on the Te Arataura, the executive board of the Kauhanganui. Although the monarchs of the Kƒ´ngitanga are not recognised by New Zealand law or by many MƒÅori tribes, they hold the distinction of being paramount chiefs of a number of important MƒÅori tribes and wield some power on a local level, especially within the Tainui iwi. The use of the title of \\"MƒÅori King\\" has been challenged by various MƒÅori leaders, namely by those of the north. In his discourse, David Rankin, a leader of the NgƒÅpuhi iwi of Northland, explains that the monarch is not the king of all MƒÅori. The argument states that by the kƒ´ngitanga claiming ownership of such a title, the rangatiratanga and mana of iwi not associated (or strongly associated) with the movement is thereby diminished, infringing therefore upon their identity and autonomy as MƒÅori and iwi. Practices A coronation celebration, the Koroneihana, is held annually at T≈´rangawaewae marae at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. The poukai is an annual circuit of visits by the MƒÅori monarch to marae that support the King movement. The tradition was started in the 1880s by TƒÅwhiao, the second MƒÅori King. The gatherings include feasting and cultural performances.

Correctly written components of crash-only software can microreboot to a known-good state without the help of a user. Since failure-handling and normal startup use the same methods, this can increase the chance that bugs in failure-handling code will be noticed, except when there are leftover artifacts, such as data corruption from a severe failure, that don't occur during normal startup. Crash-only software also has benefits for end-users. All too often, applications do not save their data and settings while running, only at the end of their use. For example, word processors usually save settings when they are closed. A crash-only application is designed to save all changed user settings soon after they are changed, so that the persistent state matches that of the running machine. No matter how an application terminates (be it a clean close or the sudden failure of a laptop battery), the state will persist.  Erlang  Erlang is a computer language originally built by Ericsson for fault-tolerant telephone switches. Programs are structured as modules that can be replaced (hot swapped) without having to restart the entire program. If a module crashes or needs to be updated it can be restarted or replaced without affecting any other part of the program.

New England. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 264 is the traditional regional dialect of Maine, New Hampshire, and the eastern half of Massachusetts.Stanford et al. (2012: 130) Features of this variety once spanned an even larger dialect area of New England, for example, including the eastern halves of Vermont and Connecticut for those born as late as the early twentieth century.Stanford et al. (2012: 161) Studies vary as to whether the unique dialect of Rhode Island technically falls within the Eastern New England dialect region.See, for example, that Labov's 2006 Atlas of North American English frequently includes Providence/Rhode Island under this general dialect, yet his 1997 Regional Telsur Map does not. Eastern New England English (here, including Rhode Island English) is classically associated with sound patterns such as non-rhoticity (or dropping r when not before a vowel); both variants of Canadian raising, including a fairly back starting position of the vowel (as in ); and some variation of the vowel distinctions, the marry‚Äìmerry distinction, or both.Stanford et al. (2012: 154) Certain Eastern New England English characteristics are retreating as some younger Eastern New Englanders avoid them, particularly non-rhoticity and the aforementioned distinctions,Stanford et al. (2014: 120) which they tend to perceive as old-fashioned, overly rural- sounding,Stanford et al. (2012: 160-1) or even overly urban-sounding with regards to Boston. New Hampshire speakers on the whole are particularly well- documented as retreating from those features since the mid-twentieth century onwards.Platt, Melanie, \\"Do you \\"park your car\\" or \\"pahk your cah?: The Changing Dialect of Southern New Hampshire\\" (2015). Inquiry Journal 2015. 5. http://scholars.unh.edu/inquiry_2015/5Nagy, Naomi (2001). \\" 'Live Free or Die' as a Linguistic Principle\\". American Speech, Volume 76, Number 1, Spring 2001, pp. 30-41. Overview of phonology The sound system of traditional Eastern New England English includes: *Non-rhoticity: The r sound may be \\"dropped\\" or \\"silent\\" if it is not before a vowel; therefore, in words like car, letter, horse, poor, etc. The feature is retreating and is not found in many younger speakers, for example, in virtually no speakers born since the mid-1900s in southeastern New Hampshire. *Linking and intrusive r: The non-rhotic r may be pronounced after all if it is followed by a vowel, even a vowel that begins the next word in the sentence. Also, any word that ends in /…ô/ (as in Cuba), /…ë/ (as in spa), or /…î/ (as in law) can be followed by an unwritten r sound when followed by a vowel sound in the next word: thus, law and public safety sounds like Lauren public safety. *Backing of : The vowel of goose, rude, coup, etc. remains pronounced relatively far back in the mouth. *Horse‚Äìhoarse merger in transition: The vowel of words like war versus wore, or morning versus mourning, are mostly produced either very close or the same in Eastern New England; however, as of the early 2000s, such vowels may still be pronounced differently by some Eastern New England speakers, especially in Maine. Conversely, the merger of the vowels is largely complete elsewhere in the United States. *Full Canadian raising: The tongue is raised in the first element of the gliding vowel as well as whenever either appears before a voiceless consonant. Therefore, a word like house is often . *Backing of : The vowel of gouge, loud, town, power, etc. has a relatively back-of-mouth starting position: thus, something like . *Lack of mary‚Äìmarry‚Äìmerry merger: Before intervocalic , the vowels ( in rhotic varieties), and (as in Mary, marry, and merry) are distinguished from one another. However, recent studies have shown that there is an emerging tendency in Northeastern New England to merge them to some extent. In contrast, Southeastern New England (namely, Rhode Island) continues to keep them all separate, as in the New York City area and Britain. *\\"Short a\\" nasal system: The \\"short a\\" sound may be tensed in various environments, though most severely before a nasal consonant; therefore, in words like man, clam, Annie, etc. *Fronting of /: The vowel of words like palm, spa, car, park, etc. is pronounced farther to the front of the vocal tract than in most other dialects, so that car, for example, is something like . This, plus non-rhoticity, is often associated with the shibboleth \\"Park the car in Harvard yard.\\" This fronting is seldom reported in Rhode Island, in which car is more often backed .

Dartmouth Senior Theses Presentations. In addition to the widespread term wicked, the word pisser, often phonetically spelled pissa(h), is another Northeastern New England intensifier (plus sometimes an uncountable noun) for something that is very highly regarded by the speaker. Northeastern New England English Northeastern New England English, popularly recognized as a Boston or Maine accent, in addition to all the above phonological features, further includes the merger of the vowel in cot and caught to , often with a slightly rounded quality, but a resistance to the merger of the vowels in father versus bother, a merger that is otherwise common throughout North America. Also, for speakers born before 1950, the words half and pass (and, before World War II, also ask and can't) are pronounced with a \\"broad a,\\" like in spa: and . =Boston= Boston, Massachusetts is the birthplace and most famous site of Eastern New England English. Historically, a Northeastern type of New England English spread from metropolitan Boston into metropolitan Worcester, the bulk of New Hampshire, and central and coastal Maine. Boston speech also originated many slang and uniquely local terms that have since spread throughout Massachusetts and Eastern New England. Although mostly non- rhotic, the modern Boston accent typically pronounces the r sound in the vowel, , as in bird, learn, turkey, world, etc. =Maine= The old Maine accent, the closest remnant today to an old Yankee regional accent, includes the phonology mentioned above, plus the loss of the phonemic status of (as in there), (as in here), and (as in more) all of which are broken into two syllables (): they-uh, hee-yuh, and moh-uh; some distinct vocabulary is also used in this accent. Maine is one of the last American regions to resist the horse‚Äìhoarse merger. This continued resistance was verified by some speakers in a 2006 study of Bangor and Portland, Maine, yet contradicted by a 2013 study that reported the merger as embraced by Portland speakers \\"of all ages\\".Ryland, Alison (2013). \\"A Phonetic Exploration of the English of Portland, Maine\\". Swarthmore College. The traditional horse‚Äìhoarse separation means that words like war and wore may sound different: war rhyming with law , and wore rhyming with boa . Unlike the Boston accent, this traditional Maine accent may be non-rhotic entirely: even in the pronunciation of as . =Cultivated New England= A cultivated New England accent, sometimes known as a \\"Boston Brahmin accent\\" within Boston, was once associated with members of wealthy New England families in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; it is now essentially extinct. Notable example speakers included many members of the Kennedy family born in this time period, including President John F. Kennedy, whose accent is not a common Boston accent so much as a \\"tony Harvard accent\\". This accent retained an older cot‚Äìcaught distinction, a less fronted vowel in some speakers, non-rhotic , and a split ( versus ). This accent corresponds in its time-frame and in much of its sound with the cultivated American accent promoted in prestigious Northeastern boarding schools and theatrical elocution courses in the same era.Knight, Dudley. \\"Standard Speech\\".

It was constructed in the 16th century following an original design by Michelangelo Buonarroti. Other architects and artists added to the church over the following centuries. During the Kingdom of Italy, the church was used for religious state functions.  Description  The basilica is dedicated to the Christian martyrs, known and unknown. By a brief dated 27 July 1561, Pius IV ordered the church \\"built\\", to be dedicated to the Beatissimae Virgini et omnium Angelorum et Martyrum (\\"the Most Blessed Virgin of all the Angels and Martyrs\\"). Impetus for this dedication had been generated by the account of a vision of the Archangel Uriel experienced in the ruins of the Baths in 1541 by a Sicilian monk, Antonio del Duca, who had been lobbying for decades for papal authorization of a more formal veneration of the Angelic Princes. A story that these Martyrs were Christian slave labourers who had been set to constructing the Baths is modern. It was also a personal monument of Pope Pius IV, whose tomb is in the apsidal tribune. The thermae of Diocletian dominated the Viminal Hill with their ruined mass. Michelangelo Buonarroti worked from 1563 to 1564 to adapt a section of the remaining structure of the baths to enclose a church. Some later construction was directed by Luigi Vanvitelli in 1749. At Santa Maria degli Angeli, Michelangelo achieved a sequence of shaped architectural spaces, developed from a Greek cross, with a dominant transept, with cubical chapels at each end, and the effect of a transverse nave. There is no true facade; the simple entrance is set within one of the coved apses of a main space of the thermae. The vestibule with canted corners and identical side chapels‚Äîone chapel has the tomb of Salvator Rosa, the other of Carlo Maratta‚Äîleads to a second vestibule, repeated on the far side of the transept, dominated by the over lifesize Saint Bruno of Cologne by Jean Antoine Houdon (1766). Of the Saint Bruno, Pope Clement XIV said that he would speak, were it not for the vow of silence of the order he founded. The raised space of the tribune. The great vaulted transept emphasized the scale of the Roman constructions, 90.8 meters long, and with the floor that Michelangelo raised to bring it up to the 16th century street level, 28 meters high. Raising the floor truncated the red granite Roman columns that articulate the transept and its flanking spaces. Michelangelo made the transept 27 meters wide, thus providing vast cubical spaces at each end of the transept. In 2006, Polish- born sculptor Igor Mitoraj created new bronze doors as well as a statue of John the Baptist for the basilica. In April 2010, a five-metre-high () bronze statue of Galileo Galilei Divine Man (designed by 1957 Nobel laureate Tsung- Dao Lee) was unveiled in a courtyard within the complex. The statue (a dedication to the 17th-century scientist and philosopher) was a donation from CCAST (China Center of Advanced Science and Technology) and WFS (World Federation of Scientists). Santa Maria degli Angeli was the official state church of the Kingdom of Italy (1870‚Äì1946). More recently, national burials have been held in the church. The church hosts the tombs of General Armando Diaz and Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, who were successful commanders during World War I on the Italian front. Also today the Basilica is used for many ceremonies, including the funeral of soldiers killed abroad. = The meridian line = At the beginning of the 18th century, Pope Clement XI commissioned the astronomer, mathematician, archaeologist, historian and philosopher Francesco Bianchini to build a meridian line, a sort of sundial, within the basilica. Completed in 1702, the object had a threefold purpose: the pope wanted to check the accuracy of the Gregorian reformation of the calendar, to produce a tool to predict Easter exactly, and, not least, to give Rome a meridian line as important as the one Giovanni Domenico Cassini had recently built in Bologna's cathedral, San Petronio. Alan Cook remarked, \\"The disposition, the stability and the precision are much better than those of the famous meridian... in Bologna\\".Alan Cook, \\"A Roman Tercentenary\\" Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 56,3 (September 2002), p. 273. This church was chosen for several reasons: (1) Like other baths in Rome, the building was already naturally southerly oriented, so as to receive unobstructed exposure to the sun; (2) the height of the walls allowed for a long line to measure the sun's progress through the year more precisely; (3) the ancient walls had long since stopped settling into the ground, ensuring that carefully calibrated observational instruments set in them would not move out of place; and (4) because it was set in the former baths of Diocletian, it would symbolically represent a victory of the Christian calendar over the earlier pagan calendar. Bianchini's sundial was built along the meridian that crosses Rome, at longitude 12¬∞ 30' E. At solar noon, which varies according to the equation of time from around 10:54 a.m. UTC in late October to 11.24 a.m. UTC in February (11:54 to 12:24 CET),Solar time the sun shines through a small hole in the wall to cast its light on this line each day. At the summer solstice, the sun appears highest, and its ray hits the meridian line at the point closest to the wall. At the winter solstice, the ray crosses the line at the point furthest from the wall. At either equinox, the sun touches the line between these two extremes. The longer the meridian line, the more accurately the observer can calculate the length of the year. The meridian line built here is 45 meters long and is composed of bronze, enclosed in yellow-white marble. In addition to using the line to measure the sun's meridian crossing, Bianchini also used the window behind the pope's coat of arms and a movable telescope to observe the passage of several stars such as Arcturus and Sirius to determine their right ascensions and declinations. The meridian line was restored in 2002 for the tricentenary of its construction, and it is still operational today.

It focuses on political analysis, investigative reporting, Southern African news, local arts, music and popular culture. History The publication began as the Weekly Mail, an alternative newspaper by a group of journalists in 1985 after the closure of two leading liberal newspapers, The Rand Daily Mail and Sunday Express. Weekly Mail was one of the first newspapers to use Apple Mac desktop publishing. The Weekly Mail criticised the government and its apartheid policies, which led to the banning of the paper in 1988 by then State President P. W. Botha. The paper was renamed the Weekly Mail & Guardian from 30 July 1993. The London-based Guardian Media Group (GMG), the publisher of The Guardian, became the majority shareholder of the print edition in 1995, and the name was changed to Mail & Guardian. In 2002, 87.5% of the company was sold to the Newtrust Company Botswana Limited, which was owned by Trevor Ncube, a Zimbabwean publisher and entrepreneur. Ncube took over as the CEO of the company. In 2006 MD Africa became the Mail & Guardian's national distributor. The change resulted in good circulation growth, despite difficult market conditions. In 2013 the newspaper achieved a record period with 51,551 copies circulated. MDA distributed a number of publications including Noseweek and Destiny magazine. In 2017, Media Development Investment Fund, a New York-based not-for-profit investment fund, announced that it had acquired a majority stake in the Mail & Guardian. The restructured ownership saw the CEO, Hoosain Karjieker, acquire a minority stake in the business as part of a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transaction. Staff continue to own a 10% share of the company. The former majority shareholder, Trevor Ncube, disposed of his equity interest. The newspaper's headquarters are in Johannesburg. The acting editor-in-chief is Sipho Kings and the CEO is Hoosain Karjieker. The Mail & Guardian Online In 1994, the Mail & Guardian Online was launched in conjunction with Media24 (a subsidiary of the Naspers group), becoming the first internet news publication in Africa. It has grown into its own daily news operation with a number of writers, multimedia producers, sub-editors and more. It is run out of the Mail & Guardian offices in Rosebank, Johannesburg. The site focuses on local, international and African hard news, sport and business. The website began its life as the Electronic Mail & Guardian, which was initially an e-mail subscription service that allowed readers living outside South Africa to receive Mail & Guardian newspaper stories before they reached newspaper subscribers. Soon after, the service expanded into a searchable online archive, published in partnership with Sangonet, the country's oldest internet service provider. A website was added, which in turn progressed from producing a weekly mirror of the printed newspaper to generating its own daily news. The Mail & Guardian Online was jointly owned by internet service provider MWEB and publishing company M&G; Media until M&G; Media purchased 100% of the operation in 2008. It has interactive news photo galleries, discussion forums and special reports on subjects such as Zimbabwe, HIV and South African President Jacob Zuma. It is known for hard-hitting political reporting, investigations as well as strong beat reporting, particularly in education, labour, environment and health.

It is officially known as SIZO#13 () which is a portmanteau for Slidchyi IZOlyator (). Though the facility is now functioning as a pre-conviction detention center, it is still colloquially called a \\"prison\\". The compound now includes minor examples of the historical architecture. The prison is infamous for its poor condition. Since late February 2016 the complex is on sale; its buyer has to build a new detention facility outside Kyiv in exchange for the territory of Lukyanivska Prison.Infamous Kyiv prison goes on sale, Kyiv Post (Feb. 24, 2016) Jail Lukyanivska in Kyiv will be put up for sale, Interfax-Ukraine (Feb. 10, 2016) View from the South History Historic image of Lukyanivska Prison, 1900 The foundation of the prison dates back to early 19th century when it was built by the guberniya architect Mikhail Ikonnikov in 1859-1862. It was officially commissioned in 1863. In Soviet times the prison's church was converted to include extra holding cells. The prison contains several subterranean corridors that connect the prison's buildings with each other. During the Stalinism it was the prison of the OGPU Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union during which time it accounted for more than 25,000 inmates. The prison consists of several buildings that over the years were uniquely titled by the holdovers. The oldest building is known as Katenka. It is the building that kept all of those sentenced to life imprisonment. The next oldest building is called Stolypinka which was named after the Russian Prime Minister Stolypin. Later another two buildings were added to its structure: Brezhnivka (built after the war) and Kuchmovka (built at times of the Ukrainian independence). There is also a juvenile detention building known as Maloletka (\\"Underage\\") or Stalinka. Other buildings are ZhK (female building), Bolnichka (Hospital). Ukrainian Ombudsman Nina Karpachova stated in September 2011 that while the facility was designed for 2,850 inmates, 3,800 were held there at the time; she also pointed out that 47 inmates with active tuberculosis threatened the health of other inmates and personnel.

JSP Model 2 is a complex design pattern used in the design of Java Web applications which separates the display of content from the logic used to obtain and manipulate the content. Since Model 2 drives a separation between logic and display, it is usually associated with the model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) paradigm. While the exact form of the MVC \\"Model\\" was never specified by the Model 2 design, a number of publications recommend a formalized layer to contain MVC Model code. The Java BluePrints, for example, originally recommended using EJBs to encapsulate the MVC Model. In a Model 2 application, requests from the client browser are passed to the controller. The controller performs any logic necessary to obtain the correct content for display. It then places the content in the request (commonly in the form of a JavaBean or POJO) and decides which view it will pass the request to. The view then renders the content passed by the controller. Model 2 is recommended for medium- and large-sized applications. History In 1998, Sun Microsystems published a pre-release of the JavaServer Pages specification, version 0.92.JSP 0.92 Specification In this specification, Sun laid out two methods by which JSP pages could be used. The first model (referred to as \\"model 1\\" due to its ordering in the document) was a simplistic model whereby JSP pages were standalone, disjointed entities. Logic could be contained within the page itself, and navigation between pages was typically achieved by way of hyperlinks. This fit with the then-common usage of template technology. ColdFusion and Active Server Pages are examples of contemporary technologies that also implemented this model. The second model referred to by the document (\\"model 2\\" in the ordering) was an improved method that combined servlet technology with JSP technology. The specific difference listed was that a servlet would intercept the request, place the content to render into a request attribute (typically represented by a JavaBean), then call a JSP to render the content in the desired output format. This model differed from the previous model in the fact that JSP technology was used as a pure template engine. All of the logic was separated out into a servlet, leaving the JSP with the sole responsibility of rendering the output for the content provided. In December 1999, JavaWorld published an article by Govind Seshadri entitled Understanding JavaServer Pages Model 2 architecture. In this article, Govind accomplished two major milestones in the use of the term \\"Model 2\\". The first milestone was to formalize the term \\"Model 2\\" as an architectural pattern rather than one of two possible options. The second milestone was the claim that Model 2 provided an MVC architecture for web- based software.How Struts Implements Model 2 (The Origins of Model 1/Model 2) Govind believed that because \\"Model 2\\" architecture separated the logic out of the JSP and placed it in a servlet, the two pieces could be seen as the \\"View\\" and the \\"Controller\\" (respectively) in an MVC architecture. The \\"Model\\" part of the MVC architecture was left open by Govind, with a suggestion that nearly any data-structure could meet the requirements. The specific example used in the article was a Vector list stored in the user's session. In March 2000, the Apache Struts project was released. This project formalized the division between View and Controller and claimed implementation of the \\"Model 2\\" pattern. Once again, the implementation of the \\"Model\\" was left undefined with the expectation that software developers would fill in an appropriate solution. Database interaction via JDBC and EJBs were options suggested on the Struts homepage. More recently, Hibernate, iBatis, and Object Relational Bridge were listed as more modern options that could be used for a model. Since the release of Struts, a number of competing frameworks have appeared. Many of these frameworks also claim to implement \\"Model 2\\" and \\"MVC\\". In result, the two terms have become synonymous in the minds of developers. This has led to the use of the term \\"MVC Model 2\\" or \\"MVC2\\" for short. Misconceptions A common misconception is that a formalized MVC pattern is required to achieve a Model 2 implementation. However, the Java BluePrints specifically warn against this interpretation:Java BluePrints 4.4.1: Structuring the Web Tier > The literature on Web-tier technology in the J2EE platform frequently uses > the terms \\"Model 1\\" and \\"Model 2\\" without explanation. This terminology > stems from early drafts of the JSP specification, which described two basic > usage patterns for JSP pages. While the terms have disappeared from the > specification document, they remain in common use. Model 1 and Model 2 > simply refer to the absence or presence (respectively) of a controller > servlet that dispatches requests from the client tier and selects views. Furthermore, the term \\"MVC2\\" has led many to a mistaken belief that Model 2 represents a next-generation MVC pattern. In fact, MVC2 is simply a shortening of the term \\"MVC Model 2\\".Struts, an open-source MVC implementation The confusion over the term \\"MVC2\\" has led to additional confusion over Model 1 code, resulting in common usage of the nonexistent term \\"MVC1\\".

It can be distinguished from contributory liability, another form of secondary liability, which is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability because, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. citing 3 Nimmer on Copyrihgt ¬ß 12.04(A)(1), at 12-70 (1995) The law has developed the view that some relationships by their nature require the person who engages others to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing of those others. The most important such relationship for practical purposes is that of employer and employee. Employers' liability Employers are vicariously liable, under the respondeat superior doctrine, for negligent acts or omissions by their employees in the course of employment (sometimes referred to as 'scope and course of employment'). To determine whether the employer is liable, the difference between an independent contractor and an employee is to be drawn. In order to be vicariously liable, there must be a requisite relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor, which could be examined by three tests: Control test, Organisation test, and Sufficient relationship test. An employer may be held liable under principles of vicarious liability if an employee does an authorized act in an unauthorized way. Employers may also be liable under the common law principle represented in the Latin phrase, qui facit per alium facit per se (one who acts through another acts in one's own interests). That is a parallel concept to vicarious liability and strict liability, in which one person is held liable in criminal law or tort for the acts or omissions of another. In Australia, the 'sufficient relationship' test, entailing the balancing of several factors such as skill levels required in the job, pay schemes, and degree of control granted to the worker, has been the favoured approach.. For an act to be considered within the course of employment, it must either be authorized or be so connected with an authorized act that it can be considered a mode, though an improper mode, of performing it.. Courts sometimes distinguish between an employee's \\"detour\\" vs. \\"a frolic of their own\\". For instance, an employer will be held liable if it is shown that the employee had gone on a mere detour in carrying out their duties, such as stopping to buy a beverage or use an automated teller machine while running a work-related errand, whereas an employee acting in his or her own right rather than on the employer's business is undertaking a \\"frolic\\" and will not subject the employer to liability.Hilton v. Thomas Burton (Rhodes) Ltd. [1961] 1 W.L.R. 705. Principals' liability The owner of an automobile can be held vicariously liable for negligence committed by a person to whom the car has been lent, as if the owner was a principal and the driver his or her agent, if the driver is using the car primarily for the purpose of performing a task for the owner. Courts have been reluctant to extend this liability to the owners of other kinds of chattel. For example, the owner of a plane will not be vicariously liable for the actions of a pilot to whom he or she has lent it to perform the owner's purpose. In the United States, vicarious liability for automobiles has since been abolished with respect to car leasing and rental in all 50 states. One example is in the case of a bank, finance company or other lienholder performing a repossession of an automobile from the registered owner for non-payment, the lienholder has a non-delegable duty not to cause a breach of the peace in performing the repossession, or it will be liable for damages even if the repossession is performed by an agent. This requirement means that whether a repossession is performed by the lienholder or by an agent, the repossessor must not cause a breach of the peace or the lienholder will be held responsible. This requirement not to breach the peace is held upon the lienholder even if the breach is caused by, say, the debtor's objecting to the repossession or resisting the repossession. In the court case of MBank El Paso v. Sanchez, 836 S.W.2d 151, where a hired repossessor towed away a car even after the registered owner locked herself in it, the court decided that this was an unlawful breach of the peace and declared the repossession invalid. The debtor was also awarded $1,200,000 in damages from the bank. However, notably, a breach of the peace will invariably constitute a criminal misdemeanor. Criminal law imparts separate and distinct liability upon each actor considered a person under the law, and therefore a corporation and the corporation's employee may both be charged with having committed exactly the same crime, in addition to any civil liability for which the law imposes. Parental liability In the United States, the question of parental responsibility generally follows the common law principle that a parent is not civilly liable for injuries resulting from a child's negligence merely because of the parent-child relationship. When a child causes an injury, parents may be held liable for their own negligent acts, such as failure to properly supervise a child, or failure to keep a dangerous instrument such as a handgun outside the reach of their children. Many states have also passed laws that impose some liability on parents for the intentional wrongful acts committed by their minor children. Liability of corporations in tort In English law, a corporation can only act through its employees and agents so it is necessary to decide in which circumstances the law of agency or vicarious liability will apply to hold the corporation liable in tort for the frauds of its directors or senior officers. If liability for the particular tort requires a state of mind, then to be liable, the director or senior officer must have that state of mind and it must be attributed to the company. In Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Limited v. Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500, two employees of the company, acting within the scope of their authority but unknown to the directors, used company funds to acquire some shares. The question was whether the company knew, or ought to have known, that it had acquired those shares. The Privy Council held that it did. Whether by virtue of their actual or ostensible authority as agents acting within their authority (see Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co. [1912] AC 716) or as employees acting in the course of their employment (see Armagas Limited v Mundogas S.A. [1986] 1 AC 717), their acts and omissions and their knowledge could be attributed to the company, and this could give rise to liability as joint tortfeasors where the directors have assumed responsibility on their own behalf and not just on behalf of the company. So if a director or officer is expressly authorised to make representations of a particular class on behalf of the company, and fraudulently makes a representation of that class to a third party causing loss, the company will be liable even though the particular representation was an improper way of doing what he was authorised to do. The extent of authority is a question of fact and is significantly more than the fact of an employment which gave the employee the opportunity to carry out the fraud. In Panorama Developments (Guildford) Limited v Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics Limited [1971] 2 QB 711, a company secretary fraudulently hired cars for his own use without the knowledge of the managing director. A company secretary routinely enters into contracts in the company's name and has administrative responsibilities that would give apparent authority to hire cars. Hence, the company was liable. Employees' continued liability and indemnity A common misconception involves the liability of the employee for tortious acts committed within the scope and authority of their employment. Although the employer is liable under respondeat superior for the employee's conduct, the employee, too, remains jointly liable for the harm caused. As the American Law Institute's Restatement of the Law of Agency, Third ¬ß 7.01 states, Every American state follows this same rule. The question of indemnification arises when either solely the employee or solely the employer is sued. If only the employee is sued, then that employee may seek indemnification from the employer if the conduct was within the course and scope of their employment. If only the employer is sued, then the employer can attempt to avoid liability by claiming the employee's conduct was outside of the scope of the employee's authority, but the employer generally cannot sue the employee to recover indemnification for the employee's torts. For an example of a court confirming an employer's right to sue an employee for indemnification, see the case of Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd. Ecclesiastical corporations In the 2003 decision Doe v. Bennett, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that in cases of abuse scandals involving Catholic priests, liability derives from the power and authority over parishioners that the Church gave to its clergymen.

Krag was a student at Hartvig Nissens skole in Oslo. He started his military career in January 1854. He became a Second Lieutenant in 1857 and a full Lieutenant in 1861. In 1866 he was ordered to Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk, the most important Norwegian weapons factory of its day. Ole H J Krag constructed his first repeating rifle in 1868, which evolved into the Krag‚ÄìPetersson (aided by Axel Petersson) by 1872. This, as well as his work in the armoury, gave him a thorough understanding of what requirements the Norwegian Army had to a rifle, allowing him to create the successful Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen with the help of his good friend Erik J√∏rgensen. He designed a wide range of firearms during his lifetime, but only two ‚Äì the Krag‚ÄìPetersson and the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen ‚Äì were adopted by any armed forces. Fewer than 1,000 Krag‚ÄìPetersson rifles were made for the Royal Norwegian Navy, while several hundreds of thousands Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifles were made for the Danish, Norwegian and US armies. In 1880 he was named director of the armoury. After the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen was accepted as the main rifle of the Norwegian Army, he was made a Lieutenant Colonel in 1894. Personal life In 1870, Krag married Karen Elise Theodora Collett (1844-1926).

(28 July 1895 ‚Äì 7 April 1973), was the Catholic Primate of Ireland and Archbishop of Dublin between December 1940 and January 1972. He was known for the unusual amount of influence he had over successive governments. right Early Life and Education John Charles McQuaid was born in Cootehill, County Cavan, on 28 July 1895, to Dr. Eugene McQuaid and Jennie Corry. His mother died a week after his birth. His father remarried and Dr. McQuaid's new wife raised John and his sister Helen as her own. It was not until his teenage years that John learned that his biological mother had died. He was a stellar student at the Cootehill National Schoolquoted in article \\"Inspired Educator and Ecumenist of Sorts\\" by Michael O'Carroll CSSp in Studies Quarterly Review, Vol 87, No 348 After primary school, McQuaid attended St. Patrick's College in Cavan Town and then Blackrock College in Dublin, run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, where he received average grades. In 1911 he entered Clongowes Wood Jesuit College in County Kildare with his brother Eugene. In 1913, on completion of his secondary studies, he entered the novitiate of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Kimmage, Dublin. The celebrations of the centenary of the birth of Thomas Davis, a famous Protestant nationalist, occurred in 1913 while McQuaid was a novice in Kimmage. Significantly McQuaid referred in his notebook to Davis' famous question: \\"What matter that at different shrines, we pray unto one God?\\" He noted: \\"Yes for a logical Protestant but No for Catholics. We must heed what is in the creed. ... If a neutral nationality be set up, if Protestants are drawn in and not converted, is not the supernatural end missed?\\" While serving his novitiate, he studied at University College, Dublin (UCD), where he was awarded both a first class honours BA in 1917 and MA in Ancient Classics in 1918. He was also awarded an honours Higher Diploma in Education in 1919, while acting as prefect in Blackrock College, 1918‚Äì1921. He was ordained a priest on 29 June 1924. McQuaid attended the Gregorian University in Rome where he completed a doctorate in theology. In November 1925 he was recalled to Ireland to serve on the staff of Blackrock College. Dean and President of Blackrock College, 1925‚Äì39 In November 1925 McQuaid was appointed to the staff at Blackrock College in Dublin where he remained until 1939. He served as Dean of Studies from 1925‚Äì1931 and President of the College from 1931‚Äì1939. Although regarded as a strict taskmaster, Dr. McQuaid strove to improve the performance of average and poor students. Holy Ghost priest Michael O'Carroll was a student in Blackrock when McQuaid was appointed Dean of Studies. He recounts how, when McQuaid discovered that a class of sixth-year boys lacked even the rudiments of Latin late in term, he announced in his low steely voice: 'Gentlemen we shall begin with mensa'. By the end of that term, his systematic exposition of grammar and syntax enabled 17 of the 18 boys to pass the Leaving Certificate examination in Latin. At Blackrock he soon made his name as an administrator and as a headmaster with detailed knowledge of educational developments in other countries and with wide cultural views. In 1929 he was appointed special delegate on the Department of Education's Commission of Enquiry into the teaching of English; in 1930 he was the official delegate of the Catholic Headmasters' Association at the first International Congress of Free Secondary Education held in Brussels; he was present in the same capacity at later Congresses in The Hague, Luxembourg and Fribourg. Elected chairman of the Catholic Headmasters' Association in 1931, he remained in the chair until 1940, being specially co-opted to it in the autumn of 1939 on his ceasing to be President of Blackrock. In an appreciation of Dr McQuaid on the 25th anniversary of his consecration as Archbishop, Father Roland Burke Savage S.J. wrote: \\"Though a classical scholar by training and a life-long lover of Virgil, as a teacher Dr McQuaid found that he could best form his boys through teaching them an appreciation and a mastery of English prose. In teaching the theory of dramatic structure to his honours leaving class, he frequently drew his illustrations from a study of the composition of famous paintings.\\"The Church in Dublin: 1940‚Äì1965 in \\"Studies\\" Vol 54, No 216 Winter 1965 Father Burke Savage also wrote that Blackrock had a noted rugby record and that Dr McQuaid \\"realized fully the value of games in strengthening both body and character; he knew that on the rugby pitch as or the cricket crease boys learned to be unselfish, to take hard knocks well, to co-operate with each other and to work as a team .... In forming the character of his boys Dr McQuaid imbued them with a virile Catholicism and a strong sense of their social responsibilities.\\" While he was being trained as a novice and then as a priest, McQuaid's great ambition was to become a missionary to Africa. Noel Browne's biographer, John Horgan has written that: \\"For many years ...his ambition was not ecclesiastical preferment, but missionary service: at least four requests to be transferred to Africa were turned down by his superiors. He could have been one of the greatest missionary bishops of the century ‚Äì all that energy, and intellect, would have gone through the continent like a whirlwind. These talents were unleashed instead on Dublin and on Ireland.\\" Blackrock College had educated many senior Irish political and business leaders. McQuaid was close to √âamon de Valera, a future Taoiseach, himself a former Blackrock College teacher. He would later influence de Valera in drafting the modern Irish constitution (Bunreacht na h√âireann). International Eucharistic Congress 1932 The 31st International Eucharistic Congress was held in Dublin in 1932, over five days (22‚Äì26 June), in a city decorated with bunting, banners, garlands, floral arrangements, shrines and various other forms of religious decoration. The main pontifical High Mass on 26 June was attended by an estimated one million people. Regarding the garden party, Roland Burke Savage, then a Jesuit novice wrote in 1965: > The International Eucharistic Congress held in Dublin in June 1932 gave Dr. > McQuaid an early opportunity to show his mastery as an organiser in giving a > memorable garden party in the grounds of Blackrock where the Cardinal Legate > and the many hundred Bishops assembled for the Congress had the opportunity > to mingle with a huge gathering of distinguished and undistinguished guests. > The present writer was one of the undistinguished guests who gained entry by > paying a modest subscription.

The Irish Constitutional Revolution: > An Analysis of the Making of the Constitution, p. 19 However in a breach of protocol, the governor-general was not invited to the lavish state reception in Dublin Castle later that day to welcome the papal legate. Given such treatment it was hardly surprising that the situation came to a head later in 1932. The King engineered a compromise, whereby de Valera withdrew his dismissal request and McNeill, who was due to retire at the end of 1932, would push forward his retirement date by a month or so. McNeill, at the King's request, resigned on 1 November 1932.\\"Demonstration of Independence\\", Irish Examiner, October 17, 2011 Political Activity In a 1998 article in Studies magazine, McQuaid's Holy Ghost confrere Father Michael O'Carroll wrote that √âamon de Valera entered McQuaid's life at about the time the latter became President of Blackrock College in 1931. \\"De Valera was a past pupil with an amazing attachment to the college. His sons were educated there and he lived nearby. He and his wife Sin√©ad got to know Dr. McQuaid and friendship between them blossomed. The college president was a regular guest in the house and eventually his advice was sought in a very important de Valera achievement, the drafting of a new constitution for the country. Years later when de Valera was president and host to a number of bishops who had come to Blackrock College for its centenary celebrations [1960] he stated that the articles in the constitution most admired had been influenced by Dr. McQuaid who was now Archbishop of Dublin.\\"Inspired Educator and Ecumenist of Sorts, Studies, Vol 87, Number 348 This is a somewhat romanticised account that fails to mention the tensions that arose between the two men in the 1940s and 50s when McQuaid was Archbishop of Dublin and de Valera was frequently head of Government. In 1952 McQuaid writing to the Apostolic Nuncio, complained \\"From Mr de Valera's re-assumption of political leadership, the chief element of note, as far as the church is concerned, is a policy of distance. That policy is seen in the failure to consult any Bishop ...\\" In 1937 a new Irish Constitution was adopted which, inter alia, acknowledged the \\"special position\\" of the Catholic Church \\"as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.\\"Constitution of Ireland, Article 44.2 (removed by referendum in 1972) It also forbade any established state church and encouraged freedom of religion. Chapter 8 of John Cooney's \\"John Charles McQuaid, Ruler of Catholic Ireland\\" is entitled \\"Co-maker of the Constitution\\" and begins: In contrast historian Dermot Keogh (co-author with Andrew McCarthy of \\"The Making of the Irish Constitution 1937\\") has written: Appointment as Archbishop McQuaid's appointment in 1940 to the Archdiocese of Dublin, the second most important and populous in the country (see Primate of Ireland), came at a more stable point in Irish politics, following the violence involving the IRA and the Blueshirts and the tensions caused by the Economic War with the UK in the 1930s. The beginning of \\"the Emergency\\" (Ireland's term for the Second World War), had produced a new mode of national consensus. Also McQuaid's relations with the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera, were excellent in contrast to most of the hierarchy who were distinctly cool towards him. From the evidence of Irish Government archives made available in the 1990s it is clear that de Valera had pressed McQuaid's candidacy on the Vatican. However, it is doubtful if the Vatican needed much urging. McQuaid had an outstanding reputation as a Catholic educationalist and had been close to Archbishop Edward Byrne of Dublin, his immediate predecessor. His name had already been mentioned in connection with his native diocese of Kilmore. However de Valera was later to state that he had also been impressed by McQuaid's social concerns at a time when the hardships of the war were particularly affecting the poor. The hierarchy and clergy of the Irish Church reflected the views of the strong and middling farmer class from which they were mostly drawn and were uncomprehending of urban life and poverty. McQuaid, as de Valera knew, was different and this was reflected in his first Lenten pastoral in 1941. \\"The very widespread yearning for social peace is itself proof of the grave need of social reform\\", McQuaid wrote. But he emphasised that \\"whatever shape the detailed reform of the social structure ultimately may take, the only lasting basis of reconstruction can be the true faith that we profess.\\"article by Deirdre McMahon \\"The Politician ‚Äì A Reassessment\\" in Studies Review, Vol 87, No 348 David C. Sheehy, Dublin diocesan archivist wrote in 2003 that \\"McQuaid saw the achievement of high office as the natural and appropriate outcome for someone of his background, education and talents. Like Bernard Law Montgomery taking over command of the British Eighth Army before El Alamein, in the late summer of 1942, McQuaid's accession to the See of Dublin, less than two years before, unleashed a man of ability combined with prodigious energy and in his prime. For Monty and McQuaid, prima donnas both, everything that had gone before in their very different lives had been but a preparation for the assumption of senior command and for the challenge of a lifetime. Like warriors of old, they gratefully responded to the bugle call and strode forward to claim their place in history.\\"article by David C. Sheehy \\"Archbishop McQuaid: the Diocesan Administrator\\" in Doctrine and Life, March 2003 Archbishop of Dublin, 1940‚Äì71 McQuaid's consecration at St. Mary's Pro Cathedral He was appointed Archbishop of Dublin on 6 November 1940 at the age of 45. His episcopal motto was ‚ÄòTestimonium Perhibere Veritati‚Äô-\\"to bear witness to the truth\\" from John 18:37. McQuaid oversaw a massive expansion of the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of Dublin during his term. He also established a wide range of social services for the poor of the city. He is especially remembered for his work in the area of charity. In the first year of his episcopate he oversaw the establishment of the Catholic Social Welfare Conference which co-ordinated the work of the great number of charitable organisations existing in the city. The following year (1942) he set up the Catholic Social Welfare Bureau which helped emigrants and their families. He had a personal interest in providing for people who suffered physically, mentally and spiritually. During his episcopate the number of clergy increased from 370 to 600, the number of religious from 500 to 700 and the number of parishes from 71 to 131. In addition some 80 new churches were built, 250 primary schools and 100 secondary schools. In a 1998 article in Studies, historian Dermot Keogh wrote about the effect of the Archbishop's work on his own life as a schoolboy: \\"Between 1940 and 1972, the year of his resignation as archbishop [sic.], Dr McQuaid had helped provide 47 new parishes in the archdiocese, together with the necessary primary and secondary educational infrastructure in each of those areas. My generation had been a beneficiary of that policy. In the early 1950s, I had moved from the small two-roomed school beside the old church in Raheny to new premises carved out of the nearby St Anne's woods. There the classes grew exponentially ‚Äì to 56 in my case. Here was a measure for social change and for the new pastoral challenge facing the Catholic Church in the 1950s ‚Äì a decade of high emigration, high unemployment and the expansion of the working class into the Dublin suburbs.\\"\\"Towards a Biography of an Archbishop\\" by Dermot Keogh This record of phenomenal expansion had one curious side effect. Dublin has two Protestant cathedrals largely built in the Middle Ages but no Catholic cathedral. The centre of the Catholic Archdiocese is the early 19th century St Mary's Pro-Cathedral on Marlborough Street, a side street in the city centre. The Pro-Cathedral was never intended to be other than a temporary acting cathedral, pending the availability of funds to build a full cathedral. (In the aftermath of the 1921 Treaty, the Church of Ireland offered to return either St.Patrick's Cathedral or Christ Church to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland: they refused the offer). Archbishop McQuaid bought the gardens in the centre of Merrion Square and announced plans to erect a cathedral there. However, he felt obliged to use the funds originally designated for the new cathedral to build the new churches and schools instead. His successor eventually handed over the gardens to Dublin Corporation and they are now a public park.St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral As a result of the Archbishop's sense of priorities, Dublin still has no Catholic cathedral. Dr. McQuaid also took a keen interest in industrial relations and was involved in resolving several disputes during his time as Archbishop. During the Teachers Strike of 1946 he sympathised with the teachers and actively supported them. McQuaid also controversially extended the ban on Catholics attending Trinity College, Dublin. Originally Catholics had objected to being excluded from the university from 1695 until the Irish 1793 Roman Catholic Relief Act was passed. In the ensuing century Trinity came to be seen as a dangerous bastion of Protestant influence in Ireland. Exemptions were granted to businessmen such as Al Byrne (in 1948), provided that they did not join any college societies. The policy gave rise to a doggerel verse: \\"Young men may loot, perjure and shoot / And even have carnal knowledge / But however depraved, their souls will be saved / If they don't go to Trinity College\\". The general prohibition was lifted by bishops meeting at Maynooth in June 1970, towards the end of McQuaid's episcopacy. Finally, in 1961 he founded the Colleges' Volunteer Corps, drawn from Roman Catholic secondary colleges in Dublin, which carried out social work. It also served, in full uniform, as an honour guard each when he visited Lourdes, during the Patrician Year and on other occasions. Restricted to male students during his lifetime, it was opened to female students by his successors. In the 1950s, Archbishop McQuaid ordered the purchase of Ashurst, a Victorian neo-Gothic mansion on Military Road in Killiney, an upmarket suburb in south County Dublin. The house had been built in the 1860s. He renamed the mansion Notre Dame de Bois, and it became his chief residence thereafter, the Archbishop preferring the luxurious residence to Archbishop's House, the official episcopal palace in Drumcondra. =Politician= There was the impression of friendship between McQuaid and √âamon de Valera, founder of Fianna F√°il and frequent head of government from the 1930s to the late 1950s. Historian Dermot Keogh believes that there has been a tendency to view the relationship between the two men as being static and not subject to change or development. Dr Keogh thinks it was quite the reverse. The men were friends and the relationship was less complicated in the 1930s when McQuaid was not archbishop. But after his consecration, McQuaid represented in a formal fashion the interests of the Church and he defended those interests even when it brought him into conflict with the leader of the state who also happened to be his friend. That friendship never clouded both men's concepts of their duties on behalf of church and state. It is all too facile to hold, a priori, that de Valera and McQuaid sang consistently from the same hymn sheet.\\"Towards a Biography of an Archbishop\\", Dermot Keogh, Studies 1998 There was continuing conflict between McQuaid and de Valera. In 1946 McQuaid's support of the national teachers‚Äô strike, greatly annoyed de Valera. In 1951 the Fianna F√°il government (which replaced the First Inter- Party Government) introduced a revised version of Noel Browne's original Mother and Child Scheme to which the hierarchy, led by Dr. McQuaid had successfully objected. Although the Archbishop still objected to the modified version, he was out-manoeuvered by de Valera. =Personal qualities= The late John Feeney, published in 1974 \\"John Charles McQuaid ‚Äì The Man and the Mask\\". This critical essay on the archbishop presents McQuaid as living outside his time but as a \\"first class bishop of the old school\\" who, had he lived fifty years earlier \\"would have no critics worth speaking of and would hardly be remembered today except by those who benefited from his quiet, personal charity\\" (page 78/9). Feeney also evaluates his role in a negative light under the headings 'schoolteacher' and 'medievalist'. Yet, he was also for Feeney a Christian and 'a diligent, sincere and absolutely honest man who did his duty as he saw it\\".(page 79). Examples of the archbishop's \\"quiet personal charity\\" are rarely supplied in John Cooney's biography, \\"John Charles McQuaid, Ruler of Catholic Ireland\\". He quotes McQuaid's secretary (from 1940 onwards) Father Chris Mangan as recording that \\"after supper at night, six nights a week he would go out visiting hospitals\\" (page 144). However Cooney then passes quickly on to the archbishop's administrative methods. There is no discussion on how this regular visiting of the sick fits in with Cooney's portrait of a power-hungry Renaissance-style prelate. Behind his formidable exterior the Archbishop was an extremely shy man who was ill at ease at social functions. In 1963 after the first session of the Vatican Council, Dr McQuaid set up a secret all-priests Public Image Committee \\"to examine what is now called the public image of the Church in the Dublin Diocese\\". The Archbishop insisted that the committee members should pull no punches and they obliged. The committee reported that his public image \\"is entirely negative: a man who forbids, a man who is stern and aloof from the lives of the people, a man who doesn't meet the people (as they want him to) at church functions, at public gatherings, or television or in the streets, who writes deep pastoral letters in theological and canonical language that is remote from the lives of the people\\". One of the committee members noted that the archbishop was \\"somewhat disappointed\\" after the first meeting. \\"He felt the discussion centred too much on him personally. The image of the church was not the same as that of the archbishop.\\"Hold Firm: John Charles McQuaid and the Second Vatican Council, by Francis Xavier Carty, The Columba Press, 2007 =Relationship to Patrick Kavanagh= Archbishop McQuaid regularly gave money to the poet Patrick Kavanagh whom he first met in 1940. In 1946 he found Kavanagh a job on the Catholic magazine 'The Standard' but the poet remained chronically disorganised and the archbishop continued to assist him until his death in 1967. Patrick Kavanagh was a great religious poet but his long poem 'The Great Hunger' (1942) gave a very bleak view of Catholicism, and the ultra-orthodox prelate must have been well aware of this. Why he chose to disregard this uncomfortable fact is something of a mystery. (However journalist Emmanuel Kehoe wrote of Kavanagh: \\"As a teenager I'd nourished a natural Irish anti-clericalism and anger at the sex-denying Catholic Church by reading his staggeringly powerful poem, The Great Hunger. Yet even this epic exercise in savage indignation did not lose Kavanagh the patronage of the Blackrock Borgia, the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid. What this ostensibly austere Spiritan found to admire and support in the raggle-taggle character who sometimes sounded like a latter-day William Blake long puzzled me, except that McQuaid must have seen in him a deep and authentic Catholicism.\\") Genius Among The Buckleppers, Sunday Business Post, 2 March 2003 The following is an extract from 'Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography' by Antoinette Quinn (2001): > \\"Since the cancer operation, Dr McQuaid had maintained an interest in his > prot√©g√©'s welfare. When Kavanagh was still living in No 62 [Pembroke Road in > 1959], the archbishop's chauffeur-driven Humber would draw up outside at > Christmas time and the priest at the wheel would be sent to ring the > doorbell and summon the poet. Kavanagh, who checked the identity of all > callers to the front door in a car mirror he had rigged up for the purpose, > would join His Grace in the car rather than let him see the state of his > flat. On the first occasion he confided in the priest that the visit was > inconvenient because he had a woman with him. When Dr McQuaid was told, he > showed his sense of humour by responding, 'Some good woman from the Legion > of Mary, doubtless.'\\" The Archbishop also played a role in the events that led to the composition of Kavanagh's poem \\"On Raglan Road\\". There was a curious (chaste!) triangular relationship involving Kavanagh, McQuaid and Hilda Moriarty, the lady whose rejection of the poet provided the theme of the song.\\"The Poet, The Archbishop and 'On Raglan Road'\\" Irish Independent journalist Liam Collins wrote:\\"Tracing Footsteps of Kavanagh's Christmas Childhood\\" https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/tracing-footsteps-of-kavanaghs- christmas-childhood-38806613.html > \\"John Charles McQuaid, who was consecrated the 47th Archbishop of Dublin on > December 28, 1940, and was a patron of the poet when others were less > generous, was singled out for Christmas greetings.

But it was not God's will.'\\"\\"Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography\\" by Antoinette Quinn, page 262 Social Issues =National Teachers' Strike, 1946= The seven-month-long strike by the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) in 1946 strained the relationship between the Archbishop and de Valera who was Taoiseach at the time. The national (primary school) teachers wanted a wage increase and parity with their secondary school colleagues. As former teachers (and de Valera had also been Minister for Education in 1939/40), both men had a very high opinion of the teaching profession but the Government was facing severe financial constraints. De Valera acknowledged the national teachers' great responsibilities, but was not only unwilling to grant them parity with secondary teachers, but refused to meet their more modest pay demands. In his book \\"De Valera, The Man and the Myths\\" historian and journalist T. Ryle Dwyer writes: \\"When the teachers went on strike, de Valera viewed their demands as a challenge to the authority of his government, and he resisted their demands with the same kind of determination which he had resisted [IRA] hunger- strikers. He even went to the point of straining his long friendship with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, who tried to intercede on behalf of the teachers. Eventually the Archbishop persuaded the INTO to capitulate, but many teachers remained bitter and they would become enthusiastic supporters of Clann na Poblachta.\\"T. Ryle Dwyer, De Valera: The Man and the Myths (Dublin: Poolbeg, 1991, pages 294/95) =Italian communism, 1947/48= Archbishop McQuaid organised funds for post war relief in various European countries, especially in Italy, sending, clothing, footwear and food, and he arranged that cost of shipping the relief goods would be borne by the Irish Government. Monsignor Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, replied in 1947 thanking him for the unselfish generosity of the Catholics of the Archdiocese of Dublin. In a speech in Rome on the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the Holy See, the current Archbishop of Dublin Diarmaid Martin said: > \\"Archbishop McQuaid worked hard to arouse the interest of Irish public > opinion in the fight against communism in Europe in the late 1940s, when > after a communist take over in Central and Eastern Europe there was the fear > that a similar possibility could not be ruled out even for Italy itself. > Professor [Dermot] Keogh has illustrated the offer of the Irish government > to go so far as to offer hospitality to the Pope should he feel it necessary > to leave Italy. On 11 April 1948, Archbishop McQuaid made a personal appeal > on Irish state radio, with the full approval of the Irish government, to > provide funds to help defeat the communists in the upcoming General Election > in Italy. Archbishop McQuaid sent over ¬£20.000 on that occasion and the > total sent from Ireland was up to ¬£60,000. In replying, Monsignor Montini > noted how much the 'spirit of truly Christian solidarity\\" had been a > \\"profound consolation and encouragement to [the Holy Father] amidst the > sorrows and anxieties of these difficult times'.\\" =Mother and Child Scheme, 1950/51= In the early 1950s, Noel Browne, the First Inter-Party Government's Minister of Health, ‚Äì shocked by the absence of ante-natal care for pregnant women, and the resulting infant mortality rates in Ireland ‚Äì proposed providing free access to health care for mothers and children in a new Mother and Child Scheme. The government of the time sought approval from the Catholic Church in relation to the scheme. Archbishop McQuaid strongly criticised the scheme claiming it was against the \\"moral teaching\\" of the Catholic Church'. This criticism by McQuaid, in the context of his strong personal political influence, and that of the Catholic Church, resulted in the government withdrawing the scheme, and the resignation of Browne. Browne's resignation ignited a controversy as he passed on correspondence between the Bishop's house and his own department to the editor of the Irish Times R. M. \\"Bertie\\" Smyllie. The letters revealed that McQuaid and the Church held what some would deem an inappropriate level of sway over the Irish government. This controversy sparked a debate amongst the Irish people about the relationship between the church and the state. =Yugoslavian football match boycotts, 1952‚Äì55= In the 1950s Yugoslavia was run by Tito's Communist regime. Tito's courts had sent Cardinal Stepinac to prison for collaborating with the fascist Usta≈°e during the Second World War and he was released in 1951. The Catholic Church felt that it was still being discriminated against by the regime. Archbishop McQuaid persuaded the Football Association of Ireland to cancel a match between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland in 1952.History Ireland notes online He then unsuccessfully called for a boycott when a similar match was arranged for October 1955. McQuaid did however persuade the famous radio broadcaster Phil Greene not to commentate the match, which led to the memorable newspaper headline: \\"Reds turn Greene Yellow\\".Football Studies vol. 11, 1 (2008) Second Vatican Council, 1962‚Äì65 In 2007 Columba Press published \\"Hold Firm: John Charles McQuaid and the Second Vatican Council\\" by Francis Xavier Carty. The book focuses on how the legendary archbishop handled the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) and its aftermath in his own diocese. John Charles McQuaid will always be remembered for his attempt to reassure his flock at the end of the Council that \\"No change will worry the tranquility of your Christian lives\\". How wrong he was. There was to be no more tranquility in the Dublin diocese as priests and laity struggled to implement the new liturgical changes, to allow in the winds of change unloosed by Pope John XXIII, to reach out to non-Catholics with the new-fangled ecumenism and then endure the storm raised by the condemnation of artificial contraception in the encyclical Humanae Vitae issued by Pope Paul VI in July 1968. Dr McQuaid, whose watchwords were control and discipline, was ill-prepared for these turbulent years. Much in his traditional clerical formation rebelled against the new spirit of renewal, aggiornamento, emanating from the Council. He confided to a fellow conservative prelate, Bishop Michael Browne of Galway, that the Holy Faith nuns \\"will do anything to aid a parish priest. They are untouched by modern craze for aggiornamento\\". But Dr McQuaid was above all loyal to his Church and pope and in his own way introduced the necessary changes. They were \\"a new emphasis on old truths rather than new truths\\" he assured his priests and flock, divided between those who wanted to go faster and those who thought Vatican Two was a lot of hot air which would blow away and life would go on as before. FX Carty tells the story of that decade, which opens with the Council and closes with the death of Dr McQuaid. His research has thrown new light on the approach of the archbishop to the challenges, especially in the communications field. A poor communicator himself, he inspired the setting up of the Radharc religious TV programme under Fr Joe Dunn and he appointed the first diocesan lay press officer, Osmond Dowling. The files of the press office describe Dowling's private purgatory as he tried to present and defend the strange world of a diocese ruled by a clerical autocrat. Dr McQuaid's attendance at the Council sessions in Rome was dutiful but without much enthusiasm. He and his fellow bishops were unprepared for the excitement generated by the first session. Dr McQuaid for his part was unimpressed by the reporting of the Council by the Irish religious affairs correspondents. He told the Public Image Committee that \\"the criticism produced is quite ignorant, the reporting on the Council has been very bad\\". He told Fr Burke-Savage from Rome: \\"I am dismayed by the facile ignorance of the journalists who are writing about the documents that have cost us years of work, and by the more facile dictation in regard to what we bishops must now do\\". The archbishop would sometimes joke about his \\"ogre\\" image in the media. Behind the aloofness was a sense of humour but also, surprisingly, a sense of insecurity as he grappled with unwelcome change. He was devastated when the obligatory offer to resign on his 75th birthday was accepted by Pope Paul, albeit with a year's extension. Carty writes, \\"He was possibly worried that the Pope's rapid acceptance of his resignation was a negative judgement on his work\\".Tradition and Turbulence, by Joe Carroll, Irish Times 26 January 2008 (Review of \\"Hold Firm\\" by FX Carty)http://news.myhome.ie/newspaper/weekend/2008/0126/1201073628204.html Dr. McQuaid resigned his post on 4 January 1971 and formally relinquished the government of the Archdiocese of Dublin when his successor (Dermot Ryan, appointed 29 December 1971) was ordained Archbishop on 13 February 1972. =Ecumenism after Vatican II= Archbishop McQuaid implemented the decrees of Vatican II, including the ecumenical decrees . However he did warm somewhat to non-Catholics, especially those whose attitudes reflected some aspect of his own character. In his autobiography, his Holy Ghost confrere Father Michael O'Carroll records this exchange with the Archbishop: Father O'Carroll: Well, Your Grace, if you want my honest opinion, I would prefer to hear some Protestants speaking about our religion than certain Catholic priests. I would certainly prefer Malcolm Muggeridge to some of them. Archbishop McQuaid: Oh, I would agree with you, Father. Did you read his review in last Sunday's Observer of a new history of monasticism? I learned the last sentence by heart. I shall quote it: \\"The early monastic founders asked everything of their followers and they got everything; the moderns ask little and they get nothing.\\"quoted in Blog 'Vultus Christi' http://vultus.stblogs.org/2009/09/ask-little-and-get-nothing.html = RTE's Radharc programme= In response to the challenge of Vatican II, the Irish Church modernised its structures to some extent. The Catholic Communications Institute of Ireland under Father Joseph Dunn was founded. Radharc (\\"view\\" or \\"vision\\" in the Irish language), directed by Joe Dunn, was to become one of the national broadcaster RT√â's longest running documentary programmes. (It was also the first independently produced series on RT√â.) Joe Dunn was supported by Desmond Forristal, Tom Stack, Dermod McCarthy, Peter Lemass and Bily Fitzgerald, all priests of the Dublin Archdiocese. The priest programmers tackled a variety of topics including the first film shot in an Irish prison The Young Offender (1963). Radharc made films about devotional topics but Fr Dunn laid emphasis on the social gospel with films like Honesty at the Fair (1963), Down and Out in Dublin (1964), The Boat Train to Euston (1965) and Smuggling and Smugglers (1965). Radharc went to Africa in 1965 and the team continued to travel and make films until the 1990s. In total the Radharc team produced over four hundred documentaries between 1962 and 1996.\\"Twentieth Century Ireland\\" by Dermot Keogh, page 271/2 Allegations of child abuse In his biography of the Archbishop, John Cooney relates a number of stories that suggest that Dr. McQuaid had an unhealthy interest in children. The main allegation ‚Äì that the Archbishop had attempted to sexually assault a boy in a Dublin pub ‚Äì is based on an unpublished essay by McQuaid's antagonist Noel Browne. Reviewers who praised the biography stated that the author should have left out these allegations (e.g. Dermot Keogh, Professor of History and John A. Murphy, Emeritus Professor of History at University College Cork).\\"John Cooney and John Charles McQuaid (1) on http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/001289.html There is a satirical account of the controversy by then Irish Times journalist Kevin Myers in his Irishman's Diary on 10 November 1999.See article \\"\\" There is also an account by Colum Kenny, Associate Professor of Communications at Dublin City University, of a meeting he had with the Archbishop as a teenager in the 1960s. Although his attitude to Dr. McQuaid is hostile, he regards Cooney's allegations as absurd. He also provides this revealing vignette: \\"I remember the archbishop later sighing about the amount of correspondence he received from people. He waved a hand across the papers on his desk and muttered: They write to me about the system. What system? There are only people; or words to that effect.\\"See article \\"My Hour Alone with John Charles McQuaid\\", Sunday Independent, 14 November 1999 http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/001766.html Two separate allegations of paedophile abuse by McQuaid were brought to the attention of the Murphy Commission.The Irish Times article Archbishop McQuaid subject of child sex abuse complaints One complaint alleges abuse of a 12-year-old boy by Archbishop McQuaid in 1961. The complaint concerned an adult who, in January 2003, complained to the Eastern Health Board that he had been abused by Archbishop McQuaid 42 years previously. The EHB and its successor the Health Service Executive (HSE), have responsibility for caring for minors (under 18) who have been sexually abused and it is not clear where their duty lies in relation to adults accusing deceased persons. When this complaint came to light several years later, the HSE did not pass this complaint on to the Murphy Commission ‚Äì again for unexplained reasons ‚Äì but the Commission is satisfied that this was simply due to human error. In May 2009, the HSE passed the complaint to the then Director of Child Protection in the Dublin Archdiocese, who informed Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who immediately informed the Murphy Commission. The archdiocese then organised a further trawl of its files and found a letter \\"which showed that there was an awareness among a number of people in the archdiocese that there had been a concern expressed\\" about Archbishop McQuaid in 1999. John Cooney's biography of the Archbishop was published in 1999 and generated enormous publicity ‚Äì including the publication in the Sunday Times of Cooney's allegations regarding paedophilia. This was very likely to have generated the awareness referred to. Then in 2010, after the Commission's report had been published, Archbishop Martin told it he had received another abuse complaint against Archbishop McQuaid. The supplementary report of the Commission said \\"Archbishop Martin was under no obligation to give the commission this information\\". It was now a matter for the archdiocese \\"to investigate all complaints against this cleric,‚Äù it said. The 2010 complaint is the subject of a civil action against the archdiocese. The Supplement to the Murphy Report can be read at http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Dublin_Supp_Rpt.pdf/Files/Dublin_Supp_Rpt.pdf It is a very short document, does not mention Archbishop McQuaid by name, and ‚Äì unlike the main Report that goes into great detail about child abuse allegations ‚Äì gives very few details of the claims. Meanwhile, John Cooney has called on Cardinal Desmond Connell to apologise unreservedly for dismissing claims that the Archbishop McQuaid had improper sexual relations with boys. (Cardinal Connell was Archbishop of Dublin when John Cooney's book was published in 1999 and described his claims of sex abuse as \\"rumour, hearsay and conjecture\\".) A statement from John Cooney said: \\"It inflicted huge moral and material damage on me as an author and journalist. I would expect Cardinal Connell to offer me, and my publisher, the O‚ÄôBrien Press, this long overdue apology.\\" Martin Sixsmith in The Lost Child of Philomena LeePan Books 2009, ch. 9 reproduces the letter from Browne and claims McQuaid's total opposition to a government Adoption Act proposed to remove control over adoption of extra-marital children from the Catholic church and vest it in the government collapsed once he was shown the letter. Handling of allegations of abuse against clergy In 2009 a Commission of Investigation produced a Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, known as the Murphy Report. The purpose of the Commission was to probe the manner in which complaints of clerical abuse were handled. A first complaint about Fr. James McNamee (d.2002) bathing with naked adolescent boys at Stella Maris F.C. was made in January 1960, investigated initially by auxiliary bishop Patrick Dunne and reported to Archbishop McQuaid.Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 12.5 Fr.McNamee denied the allegations and was believed by the bishops. McQuaid wrote: \\"as he is a worthy priest I agree that we could not refuse to accept his word.\\"Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 12.6 Fr.McNamee moved on from the club but, Archbishop McQuaid said, not immediately \\"lest he be defamed.\\"Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 12.7 Many subsequent complaints were made about Fr.McNamee.Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 12.9 In August 1960 a UK photographic processing company passed on film posted to them from Fr. Edmondus [a pseudonym] in Dublin to Scotland Yard. The photographs were of girls' private parts. It was passed to the Commissioner of the Garda√≠, who asked Archbishop McQuaid to take over the investigation.Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.5 He in turn passed it to Bishop Dunne, who had grave concerns that a canonical crime had been committed.Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.6 Fr.Edmondus admitted to Archbishop McQuaid that he had taken pictures of children at Crumlin Hospital, because of ignorance and curiosity regarding female sex organs. He related his social discomfiture with females as he was raised with brothers (in fact he had a sister).Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.7 Archbishop McQuaid and Bishop Dunne finally agreed that a canonical crime had not been committed.Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.8 Archbishop McQuaid arranged for Fr.Edmondus to see a doctor for instruction \\"to end his wonderment\\" at female genitalia. The Commission believed that \\"Archbishop McQuaid acted as he did to avoid scandal in both Ireland and Rome and without regard to the protection of children in Crumlin Hospital.\\"Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.11 It described his usage of the word \\"wonderment\\" to describe Fr.Edmondus's actions as \\"risible.\\"Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.69 It further added, \\"The apparent cancellation by Archbishop McQuaid of his original plan to pursue the priest through the procedures of canon law was a disaster. It established a pattern of not holding abusers responsible which lasted for decadesReport into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.70 ... no attempt was made to monitor Fr.Edmondus in other placements.\\"Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, July 2009. Chapter 13.71 In 1961 Archbishop McQuaid established a hostel in Dublin for boys who had been in industrial schools ‚Äì mainly Artane ‚Äì and assigned priests to see to their spiritual welfare and to help them integrate into society. One of these priests was Diarmuid Martin who went on to become Archbishop of Dublin in 2004 and to take a strong line against alleged clerical abusers. In June 2009, John Cooney wrote an article in the Irish Independent demanding to know why Archbishop Martin had not denounced the alleged horrors of Artane 40 years previously. Patsy McGarry, Religious Affairs correspondent of the Irish Times also wrote an article entitled, \\"Archbishop Defends Abuse Inaction\\" in which Dr.Martin stated, \\"Social workers, health boards and the diocese were trying to reform and eventually close down the institutions ... Consensus soon emerged that the best ‚Äì and indeed the only ‚Äì option for Artane would be to close it down, which happened in 1969...We did consistently hear stories of severe physical abuse and Dickensian conditions there [at industrial schools]. There was no mention of explicitly sexual abuse. The situation was referred by Archbishop McQuaid to the Department of Education.\\" Death and Legacy On Saturday 7 April 1973 McQuaid was too ill to get up at his usual time of 6.30am to say Mass at his private residence, Notre Dame de Bois (originally called Ashurst), on Military Road in Killiney, south County Dublin. He was taken to Loughlinstown Hospital where he died within an hour. Shortly before his death he asked nurse Margaret O'Dowd if he had any chance of reaching heaven. She told him that if he as Archbishop could not get to heaven, few would. This answer appeared to satisfy him and he lay back on the pillow to await death. He died at about 11am.John Charles McQuaid, Ruler of Catholic Ireland by John Cooney, page 431/2 He is buried in St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. In a sermon delivered in 1955 on the occasion of the Catholic University of Ireland centenary, McQuaid praised his predecessor Cardinal Paul Cullen: \\"No writer has done adequate justice to his character or stature...Silent, magnanimous, far-seeing, Cardinal Cullen would seem to be as heedless of self-justification after death, as he was intrepid in administration during life. Not his the multitude of letters and scrupulous autobiography that help a later age to reconstruct a picture of the unspeaking dead.\\" Shortly after McQuaid's death, Cardinal John Carmel Heenan, Archbishop of Westminster, predicted in an RT√â radio documentary that history would vindicate him. In his work \\"Ireland 1912‚Äì1985\\" Professor John Joseph Lee wrote: \\"The Church is a bulwark, perhaps now the main bulwark of the civic culture. It is the very opportunism of the traditional value system that leaves religion as the main bulwark between a reasonably civilised civil society and the untrammelled predatory instincts of individual and pressure group selfishness, curbed only by the power of rival predators .... If religion were no longer to fulfil its historic civilising mission as a substitute for internalised values of civic responsibility, the consequences for the country, no less than for the church, could be lethal\\" (page 675). In his book \\"Twentieth Century Ireland\\", published in 2005 historian Dermot Keogh writes: \\"Ostensibly the old order was changing. The resignation of two figures from Irish public life at the beginning of the 1970s reinforced that perception. On 4 January 1972 [sic.], John Charles McQuaid retired as archbishop of Dublin after spending over 30 years in the post; he died on 7 April 1973. Eamon de Valera retired from the presidency in June 1973; he died on 29 August 1975. Both men had been close friends in the 1930s. They were representative of a culture of service that had been a feature of the political life of the young state. In the 1970s both men had lost their relevance. But the culture of service, upon which both had built their public lives, was an ever-diminishing influence in a state which had come to revere the philosophy of radical individualism.\\"page 330/31, \\"Twentieth Century Ireland\\", Dermot Keogh, Gill & McMillan Ltd. 2005 In a hostile article in the Irish Times on 7 April 2003, McQuaid's biographer, John Cooney provided a different slant to the observations of Professors Lee and Keogh: \\"Generally, there was a consensus that McQuaid's death marked the end of the era of Renaissance-style prelates. Officially, the President, Eamon de Valera, was \\"deeply grieved\\" to hear the news. In the privacy of Loughlinstown Hospital Dev wept over the corpse of the Holy Ghost priest on whose behalf he had lobbied the Vatican in 1940 for elevation to the See of Dublin and the Primacy of Ireland. Although their relationship at times was strained, both men co- operated to control people's lives for so long in a closed and puritanical society which the writer Se√°n √ì Faol√°in memorably decried as a \\"dreary Eden\\".

It acquired its name from the fresh water spring that flows directly beneath it. It comprises Spring Garden Road, South Park Street, and a number of smaller side streets. The area is considered to be one of the trendiest areas in Halifax and is one of the busiest shopping districts east of Montreal. Spring Garden Road is home to a number of pubs, coffee shops and boutiques, making it busy both day and night. On Spring Garden one can also find the Main Branch of Halifax Public Libraries, the Halifax Provincial Court, the school of architecture and the Sexton Campus of Dalhousie University (the former Technical University of Nova Scotia), the Halifax Public Gardens, and St. Mary's Basilica. The area is also in proximity to the Citadel and the Scotiabank Centre, and several major hotels are located nearby. Spring Garden Road runs out to Robie Street, and then becomes Coburg Road, a largely residential thoroughfare. It is served by numerous Metro Transit routes. Routes 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 53 and 68 provide service from 6am until midnight daily. History Spring Garden Road and South Park Street on a rainy night. Spring Garden Road has been the site of several significant events and has undergone many changes over the centuries, transitioning from a pasture outside the town walls of 18th century Halifax to a vibrant, mixed-use neighbourhood today. The seventy-five year period of war between the Mi'kmaq people and the British ended with the Burial of the Hatchet Ceremony. On June 25, 1761,Some accounts give the date as 8 July 1761 a ‚ÄúBurying of the Hatchet Ceremony‚Äù was held at Governor Jonathan Belcher‚Äôs garden on present-day Spring Garden Road in front of the Court House. In commemoration of these treaties, Nova Scotians annually celebrate Treaty Day on October 1. Prince Edward, Prince of Wales arrived in Halifax in July 1860, making this city his first stop on the first tour of North America by an heir to the British throne. Numerous arches were erected around the city to commemorate the occasion. The day after arriving, the Prince's procession traveled from Government House up Spring Garden Road toward the Public Gardens. An arch was erected by the archbishop at the foot of Spring Garden Road emblazoned with the words \\"Welcome to the Land of the Mayflower\\" and festooned with wreathes and thousands of roses. Further up the road a large arch, sponsored by General Trollope, Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's Forces in Nova Scotia, was erected in front of the courthouse. The archway was lauded by the British Colonist newspaper as \\"the grandest object amongst all our displays, in or around the city, outside of the Province Building.... It is the most splendid thing of the kind we have ever seen, here or elsewhere, and evinces on the part of its designer, not only much taste but real genius.\\" Other arches and monuments were set up outside the gardens and the Convent of the Sacred Heart. An area in the district, just to the south of Spring Garden Road, is known as Schmidtville. This land was purchased by James Pedley in 1781 and was originally outside the Halifax town walls. As the threat of attack from natives diminished, the land was divided into building lots for new housing and new streets laid out including Birmingham Street, Dresden Row, and Rottenburg Street (now Clyde Street). Part of Schmidtville was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with large surface parking lots. These lots are now being redeveloped into mid-size mixed-use developments. The rest of Schmidtville is home to some of the city's oldest houses. Statue of Winston Churchill outside the Spring Garden Memorial Library. The land on which the Spring Garden Road Memorial Library sits has been known as Grafton Park for two centuries or more. This lot at the corner of Brunswick Street and Spring Garden was used as a burial ground for paupers from the late 1700s to mid-1800s. It was listed as a \\"public park\\" in an 1895 insurance map. In the mid-20th century the library was built in Grafton Park, but sited back from the street to preserve a traditional walking path, running diagonally through the property, between Spring Garden and Grafton Street. The library was closed in 2014 and replaced by the Halifax Central Library across the street. Over the 20th century the city continued to grow outward. Numerous apartment towers were built in the western, less commercial part of Spring Garden Road. Spring Garden Terrace, a 201-unit apartment building, was designed by Ian Martin of Montreal and opened in 1963. Embassy Towers opened in 1967. The high residential population of the district, coupled with its mixed-use nature, makes the neighbourhood one of the most vibrant and economically successful in the city. Until the mid-20th century, Spring Garden Road was served by a tram line. The street was considered fashionable by the 1970s, home to a number of specialty stores and fine clothing retailers. It continued to grow in stature during the 1980s, and several shopping centres were built. These innovated upon earlier shopping centres on Barrington Street in that they did not turn a blank wall to the street, but instead maintained continuous shop frontage. Park Lane opened in 1988. City Centre Atlantic, a mixed-use development on Spring Garden Road, was developed by Halifax company Ryco Developments Limited in the late 1980s. Spring Garden Place expanded in 1992. Gathering places The new Halifax Central Library The street sees some of the highest foot traffic in the city, and hosts several popular public gathering places. The Lord Nelson Hotel, at the corner of Spring Garden Road and South Park Street, is a Halifax landmark. During the 1960s its grounds were a popular hang-out for artists and hippies and inspired a novel, Lord Nelson Tavern by Ray Smith, but the wall outside upon which people sat was subsequently redeveloped into shops. The park outside the Spring Garden Memorial Library is a particularly popular place to stop and rest. Citizens can enjoy the buskers and purchase food from several vendors, including the Bud the Spud chip truck. The low wall around the garden is a very popular place to sit and rest. Victoria Park, with its memorials to Scottish writers, Walter Scott and Robert Burns, including the square surrounding the Burns statue at the corner of Spring Garden and South Park, is sometimes used for arts events, community gatherings, and demonstrations. In 2011, the site was briefly home to the Occupy Nova Scotia movement, who agreed to relocate there after Mayor Peter J. Kelly requested they vacate the Grand Parade to make way for the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies. Unbeknownst to the protestors, the mayor controversially issued an order to have the site cleared by police on the morning of Remembrance Day, and several protesters were arrested. The new Halifax Central Library on the corner of Spring Garden Road and Queen Street forms a new locus of activity on a site which had previously been a surface parking lot for over five decades.

Mair now presents his show on LBC between 4pm and 7pm every weekday. Mair also hosted BBC Radio 4's daily news magazine PM, the Radio 4 Saturday iPM, and NewsPod. He occasionally presented Newsnight and Any Questions. Mair became a stand-in presenter for The Andrew Marr Show following Marr's stroke. Mair left the BBC in August 2018. Early life Mair was born in Dundee. His amateur broadcasting career is reported to have started by using the public address system in his school, Whitfield High School, (now Braeview Academy School) in the Dundee housing scheme, Whitfield. Career Mair's professional career began after he rejected a university place in order to present on Radio Tay, a local Dundee station. Mair joined the BBC in 1987 as a sub-editor for Radio Scotland. He moved on to present Good Morning Scotland and Reporting Scotland, then Eddie Mair Live in the mid- morning slot for Radio Scotland. In 1993, he hosted Breakaway, the weekly 'travel and leisure' programme on BBC Radio 4. He then joined Radio Five Live when it began in 1994 presenting the Midday with Mair news show. From 1996 to 2000, he presented the BBC/PRI programme The World. Mair was the host of the Sunday current affairs programme Broadcasting House from its launch in April 1998, until 2003, when he took over PM and Fi Glover became presenter of the weekly show. On both programmes, Mair mixed serious journalism with witty and satirical commentary. After reading out the weather forecast, he would invariably encourage listeners with a jaunty \\"Do wrap up\\", whether the forecast was cold or warm. Since Nick Clarke died in 2006, Mair has substituted for Jonathan Dimbleby as the presenter of Any Questions. Standing in for Andrew Marr on his Sunday morning show on 24 March 2013, Mair interviewed London Mayor Boris Johnson asking critical questions about past known misdeeds such as lying to a minister and commenting: \\"you're a nasty piece of work\\". Patrick Wintour in The Guardian commented that \\"Johnson's reputation had taken a severe pounding\\", while Dan Hodges in his Telegraph blog thought Mair's approach was a \\"disgrace\\". Johnson himself said that Mair had done a \\"splendid job\\". Mair has also presented Newsnight on BBC Two and The 7 O'Clock News on BBC Three. On PM, Mair had a long-running on-air feud ‚Äì real or simulated ‚Äì with Robert Peston, the BBC's former Economics Editor. For leap day in 2012, Peston co-hosted the PM programme with Mair, and in 2015 they co-hosted the show \\"The Robert Peston Interview Show (With Eddie Mair)\\" Mair was the original host of the 2003 BBC Two series Time Commanders. From 27 to 30 October 2014, Mair guest presented four editions of The One Show with Alex Jones on BBC One. On 29 February 2016, to the accompaniment of Nat 'King' Cole playing Let There Be Love, Valerie Singleton proposed marriage to Mair live on Radio 4's PM programme, in line with the tradition that women may propose marriage on one day only ‚Äì 29 February. In the same spirit of gentle humour, he promised to think about it and give her an answer in 2020.PM, BBC Radio 4, 29 February 2016. Mair's BBC earnings were between ¬£300,000 and ¬£350,000 for the 2016-17 financial year. The Guardian reported that he refused to take an earnings cut as part of the BBC's gender equality adjustments made in 2017 and 2018. Mair denied this, writing in the Radio Times, \\"None of my thinking has been influenced by the BBC's pay problems. I'd offered, in writing, to take a cut. It tickled me to read sometimes that I was apparently refusing. The first article appeared before we'd even discussed pay, and later it was said I was staying off work in some kind of protest: in fact, as RT [Radio Times] readers know, I was in hospital trying to avoid sepsis.\\" On 1 July 2018, Mair announced that he would depart the BBC, presenting his last PM show on 17 August 2018. The following day it was announced that Mair would be joining LBC; his first show for the station will be broadcast in September 2018. In fact, Mair presented his final PM show on 8 August 2018, although he did not acknowledge this during the broadcast. The next day, Mair emailed the PM team to say: > \\"[...] I want to tell you about what happened just after PM finished last > night. As you may know, we finished the show with a full rendition by Willie > Nelson of 'Bring Me Sunshine'. It was, in keeping with the tradition of PM, > a suggestion by a listener.

The ship was initially built as the Starre in 1615 and renamed the Jason by Sir Walter Raleigh for use in his second expedition to Guiana (then under control of the Spanish) in 1617. Following Raleigh's return it was seized and became a merchant ship, renamed the Angel Gabriel. A stout ship designed and built to cope with combat, even as a merchant ship, the Angel Gabriel was involved in many further skirmishes between 1618 and 1635, including a notable engagement in 1627 off Cales where it was boarded several times but was able to clear its decks each time and eventually beat off three Spanish ships. This was possible because the defenders were able to retreat into the forecastle and sterncastle, which had reinforced bulkheads fitted with gunports for small cannon and shoulder weapons. 1635 voyage From England to Massachusetts in a fleet of five ships, the Angel Gabriel joined the James, the Elizabeth (Bess), the Mary and the Diligence. As they approached New England, an unusually powerful early season hurricane struck, known as the \\"Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635\\", and the James and the Angel Gabriel were forced to ride it out just off the coast of modern-day Hampton, New Hampshire. According to the ship's log and the journal of Increase Mather, whose father Richard Mather and family were on the James, the following was recorded: :\\"And I must confess, I have peculiar reason to commemorate that solemn providence, inasmuch an my father and mother and four of my brethren wore then in a vessel upon the east of New-England, being at anchor amongst the rocks at the Isles of Shoals when the storm began; but their cables broke, and the ship was driving directly upon a mighty rock, so that all their lives were given up for lost; but then in an instant of time, God turned the wind about, which carried them from the rock of death before their eyes.\\" All one hundred-plus passengers aboard the James managed to make it to Boston Harbor two days later. The Angel Gabriel was wrecked off the coast of Maine, but the smaller, faster ships, the Mary, the Bess, and the Diligence outran the storm, and landed in Newfoundland on 15 August 1635. Several plaques commemorating the loss of the Angel Gabriel have been placed near Pemaquid. One reads: :Here at Pemaquid Harbor on 15 August 1635, the 250-ton galleon Angel Gabriel was wrecked in a fierce hurricane one day after her arrival from Bristol, England. Many of the vessel's immigrants to the new world had come ashore at the small Pemaquid settlement before the storm struck, but several crew members and passengers still aboard the ship perished. The surviving passengers eventually departed Pemaquid for towns in northeastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. :This marker commemorating the historic voyage and loss of the Angel Gabriel was dedicated on 15 August 2010, the 375th anniversary of the wreck, by descendants of William Furber, a 21-year-old passenger who later settled in Dover, New Hampshire.

It was formed in 1981 by the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation and Tasman Pulp and Paper. It had holdings in construction, forestry, building, and energy, initially just within New Zealand and then internationally as well, and at one time was the largest company in New Zealand. In 2001 it was split into three companies, Fletcher Challenge Forests, Fletcher Building (incorporating Fletcher Construction), and Rubicon. History The corporation was formed in January 1981 with the mutual merger of Challenge Corporation, Fletcher Holdings and Tasman Pulp and Paper. It was initially based in Wellington's Challenge House,The Fletcher Trust Archive - Fletcher Challenge House but later moved in 1987 to a new head office in Penrose, Auckland. In 1987 the corporation acquired the state-owned enterprise Petrocorp, and created the Fletcher Energy division. Fletcher Energy's assets were subsequently sold to Shell New Zealand. In November 1993 Fletcher Challenge's share market listing was split into two shares, the Ordinary Division and Forests Division. The Forests Division consisted of the corporation's wood plantation assets and forestry activities. The Ordinary Division consisted of the corporation's pulp and paper, energy and building assets. In March 1996 the Ordinary Division was split further by creating three new shares - Fletcher Challenge Paper, Fletcher Challenge Building and Fletcher Challenge Energy. This structure lasted three years, until December 1999 when the Board of Directors of the company resolved to dismantle the Fletcher Challenge and establish separate companies. In 2000 the Canadian pulp and paper assets were sold to Norske Skog to form NorskeCanada. In 2001 Fletcher Challenge was split into three companies, Fletcher Challenge Forests (later renamed Tenon), Fletcher Building (incorporating Fletcher Construction), and Rubicon. A September 1996 investment in Central North Island Forest Partnership ended in receivership and is said to have contributed to the break up of Fletcher Challenge.

The film is based on the book of the same name by Todd Walton, with a script by then writing duo Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson.  Plot  After a suicide attempt leaves a man named Roary (John Savage) partially crippled, he finds himself living in a rundown house in Oakland, California. He spends a lot of time at a neighborhood bar, which is full of other disabled people, and becomes best friends with Jerry (David Morse), the barman with a bad leg. Jerry gains the attention and respect from the Golden State Warriors when he scrimmages a player and loses narrowly. Jerry's luck turns round when one of the professional basketball players lends him the money for an operation to fix his leg. Once he is fully healed, Jerry goes on to become a basketball star, fulfilling his lifelong dream. However, he abandons his old friends by pretending they never existed.  Cast  * John Savage as Roary * David Morse as Jerry Maxwell * Diana Scarwid as Louise * Amy Wright as Anne * Tony Burton as Lucius * Bill Henderson as Blue Lewis * Steve Kahan as Burt * Jack O'Leary as Max * Bert Remsen as Stinky * Harold Russell as Wings * Pepe Serna as Herrada * Harold Sylvester as Alvin Martin * Arnold Williams as Benny * George Brenlin as Gil * Gerri Dean as Hooker * William Frankfather as Fryer  Production  In his 2006 audio commentary for Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, Donner states that he agreed to direct Inside Moves only to take his mind off of being fired and replaced from Superman II. He referred to Inside Moves as \\"the smallest film I could do that was just very near and dear to me, at that point, and I felt this is going to take my mind totally off that.\\" Diana Scarwid's performance as Louise, Roary's girlfriend, earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The movie also marked the return to the screen by disabled veteran Harold Russell, thirty-four years after his Oscar-winning role in The Best Years of Our Lives. Donner's biographer James Christie relates how the director confused Cinematographer Kov√°cs with his fellow Hungarian Vilmos Zsigmond, referring to him as \\"Vilmos\\" repeatedly. When Zsigmond dropped by the set to visit, Donner had T-shirts made up that read \\"MY NAME IS NOT L√ÅSZL√ì\\" and \\"MY NAME IS NOT VILMOS\\" for each of them.

Diagram of the opponent process Log-log plot of spatial contrast sensitivity functions for luminance and chromatic contrast The opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone cells and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. There is some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which the three types of cones (L for long-wave, M for medium-wave, and S for short-wave light) respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels the cone photoreceptors are linked together to form three opposing color pairs: red versus green, blue versus yellow, and black versus white (the last type is achromatic and detects light-dark variation, or luminance). It was first proposed in 1892 by the German physiologist Ewald Hering. When people stare at a bright color for too long, for example, red, and look away at a white field they will perceive a green color. Activation of one member of the pair inhibits activity in the other. This theory also helps to explain some types of color vision deficiency. For example, people with dichromatic deficiencies must match a test field using only two primaries. Depending on the deficiency they will confuse either red and green or blue and yellow. The opponent-process theory explains color vision as a result of the way in which photoreceptors are interconnected neurally. The opponent-process theory applies to different levels of the nervous system. Once the neural system passes beyond the retina to the brain, the nature of the cell changes and the cell responds in an opponent fashion. For example, the green and red photoreceptor might each send a signal to the blue-red opponent cell farther along with the system. Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color. That is, opposite opponent colors are never perceived together ‚Äì there is no \\"greenish red\\" or \\"yellowish blue\\". While the trichromatic theory defines the way the retina of the eye allows the visual system to detect color with three types of cones, the opponent process theory accounts for mechanisms that receive and process information from cones. Though the trichromatic and opponent processes theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for the opponent process receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.Kandel ER, Schwartz JH and Jessell TM, 2000. Principles of Neural Science, 4th ed., McGraw‚ÄìHill, New York. pp. 577‚Äì80. Besides the cones, which detect light entering the eye, the biological basis of the opponent theory involves two other types of cells: bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. Information from the cones is passed to the bipolar cells in the retina, which may be the cells in the opponent process that transform the information from cones. The information is then passed to ganglion cells, of which there are two major classes: magnocellular, or large- cell layers, and parvocellular, or small-cell layers. Parvocellular cells, or P cells, handle the majority of information about color and fall into two groups: one that processes information about differences between the firing of L and M cones, and one that processes differences between S cones and a combined signal from both L and M cones. The first subtype of cells is responsible for processing red‚Äìgreen differences, and the second process blue‚Äìyellow differences. P cells also transmit information about the intensity of light (how much of it there is) due to their receptive fields. History Johann Wolfgang von Goethe first studied the physiological effect of opposed colors in his Theory of Colours in 1810. Goethe arranged his color wheel symmetrically \\"for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands purple; orange, blue; red, green; and vice versa: Thus again all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other.\\" Ewald Hering proposed opponent color theory in 1892.Hering E, 1964. Outlines of a Theory of the Light Sense. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press. He thought that the colors red, yellow, green, and blue are special in that any other color can be described as a mix of them, and that they exist in opposite pairs. That is, either red or green is perceived and never greenish-red: Even though yellow is a mixture of red and green in the RGB color theory, the eye does not perceive it as such. In 1957, Leo Hurvich and Dorothea Jameson provided quantitative data for Hering's color-opponent theory. Their method was called hue cancellation. Hue cancellation experiments start with a color (e.g. yellow) and attempt to determine how much of the opponent color (e.g. blue) of one of the starting color's components must be added to eliminate any hint of that component from the starting color.Wolfe, Kluender, & Levi, (2009) In 1959, Svaetichin and MacNichol recorded from the retina of fish and reported of three distinct types of cells: one responded with hyperpolarization to all light stimuli regardless of wavelength and was termed a luminosity cell. A second cell responded with hyperpolarization at short wavelengths and with depolarization at mid-to-long wavelengths. This was termed a chromaticity cell. A third cell, also a chromaticity cell, responded with hyperpolarization at fairly short wave- lengths, peaking about 490 nm, and with depolarization at wavelengths longer than about 610 nm. Svaetichin and MacNichol called the chromaticity cells Yellow- Blue and Red-Green opponent color cells. Similar chromatically or spectrally opposed cells, often incorporating spatial- opponency (e.g. red \\"on\\" center and green \\"off\\" surround), were found in the vertebrate retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) through the 1950s and 1960s by De Valois et al., Wiesel and Hubel, and others. After Svaetichin's lead, the cells were widely called opponent colour cells, Red-Green and Yellow-Blue. Over the next three decades, spectrally opposed cells continued to be reported in primate retina and LGN. A variety of terms are used in the literature to describe these cells, including chromatically opposed or -opponent, spectrally opposed or -opponent, opponent colour, colour opponent, opponent response, and simply, opponent cell. The opponent color theory can be applied to computer vision and implemented as the Gaussian color model and the natural-vision-processing model.Barghout, Lauren. (2014). \\"Visual taxometric approach to image segmentation using fuzzy-spatial taxon cut yields contextually relevant regions\\".

Vision: Global Perceptual Context Changes Local Contrast Processing, Updated to include computer vision techniques. Scholars' Press, (21 February 2014). Others have applied the idea of opposing stimulations beyond visual systems, described in the article on opponent-process theory. In 1967, Rod Grigg extended the concept to reflect a wide range of opponent processes in biological systems.Grigg, E. R. N. (1967). Biologic Relativity. Chicago: Amaranth Books. In 1970, Solomon and Corbit expanded Hurvich and Jameson's general neurological opponent process model to explain emotion, drug addiction, and work motivation. Criticism and the complementary color cells There is a lot of controversy over whether Opponent-processing theory is the best way to explain color vision. There have been a few experiments involving image stabilization (where you experience border loss) that produced results that suggest participants have seen ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù colors, or color combinations we shouldn't be able to see under the Opponent-processing theory; However, many criticize that this may just be illusionary experiences. Critics and researchers have instead started to turn to explain color vision through references to retinal mechanisms, rather than opponent processing, which happens in the brain's visual cortex. As recordings from single cell accumulated, it became clear to many physiologists and psychophysicists that opponent colors did not satisfactorily account for single cell spectrally opposed responses. For instance, Jameson and D‚ÄôAndrade analyzed opponent- colors theory and found the unique hues did not match the spectrally opposed responses. De Valois himself summed it up: ‚ÄúAlthough we, like others, were most impressed with finding opponent cells, in accord with Hering‚Äôs suggestions, when the Zeitgeist at the time was strongly opposed to the notion, the earliest recordings revealed a discrepancy between the Hering- Hurvich-Jameson opponent perceptual channels and the response characteristics of opponent cells in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus.‚Äù Valberg recalls that ‚Äúit became common among neurophysiologists to use colour terms when referring to opponent cells as in the notations ‚Äòred-ON cells‚Äô, ‚Äògreen-OFF cells‚Äô .... In the debate .... some psychophysicists were happy to see what they believed to be opponency confirmed at an objective, physiological level. Consequently, little hesitation was shown in relating the unique and polar color pairs directly to cone opponency. Despite evidence to the contrary .... textbooks have, up to this day, repeated the misconception of relating unique hue perception directly to peripheral cone opponent processes. The analogy with Hering's hypothesis has been carried even further so as to imply that each color in the opponent pair of unique colors could be identified with either excitation or inhibition of one and the same type of opponent cell.‚Äù Webster et al. and Wuerger et al. have conclusively re-affirmed that single cell spectrally opposed responses do not align with unique-hue opponent colours. In 2013, Pridmore argued that most Red-Green cells reported in the literature in fact code the Red-Cyan colors. Thus, the cells are coding complementary colors instead of opponent colors. Pridmore reported also of Green-Magenta cells in the retina and V1. He thus argued that the Red-Green and Blue-Yellow cells should be instead called \\"Green-magenta\\", \\"Red-cyan\\" and \\"Blue-yellow\\" complementary cells. An example of the complementary process can be experienced by staring at a red (or green) square for forty seconds, and then immediately looking at a white sheet of paper. The observer then perceives a cyan (or magenta) square on the blank sheet. This complementary color afterimage is more easily explained by the trichromatic color theory than the traditional RYB color theory; in the opponent-process theory, fatigue of pathways promoting red produce the illusion of a cyan square.

A housekeeper is an individual responsible for the supervision of a house's cleaning staff. The housekeeper may also perform the cleaning duties themself. History In the great houses of the eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the housekeeper could be a woman of considerable power in the domestic arena. The housekeeper of times past had her room (or rooms) cleaned by junior staff, her meals prepared and laundry taken care of, and with the butler presided over dinner in the Servants' Hall. Unlike most other servants, she was addressed as Mrs regardless of her marital status. Today's head of household staff in a great house lives in much the same manner, although fewer households can afford large retinues of servants with an elaborate hierarchy. In some countries this is due to the minimum wage. The housekeeper is generally hired by and reports to the lady of the house. The extent to which the housekeeper supervises other staff varies from household to household. In general, the staff of a grand dwelling is divided into departments, with the housekeeper in charge of all the female staff with the possible exception of the kitchen staff, who report to the cook, and the between staff, who may report to the butler; in these cases the cook and butler reported directly to the lady of the house. In other households, particularly those of the very wealthy who maintain several residences, the housekeeper is the ultimate head of household staff and may hire and/or fire junior staff, subject to the approval of the lady of the house, and make recommendations for senior staff. In this case, the cook and butler report to the lady of the house through the housekeeper. The housekeeper, also called a necessary woman, was a position in the UK's civil service and royal household. The duties were menial, housekeeping work such as emptying chamber pots. Today's cook-housekeeper In developed countries, fewer families can afford live-in help as they once did. Fewer hereditary grand households exist due to the World Wars, though a considerable number do exist in places such as the United Kingdom. Fewer families employ staff due to advances in technology and the lack of need due to social status. In nations where there is still a ready supply of inexpensive labour, the middle classes may still be able to afford servants. For these households, the remnant of the once grand position of head housekeeper is often a cook-housekeeper. The modern cook-housekeeper performs cooking and cleaning duties. In countries such as the U.S., the U.K., France and the European countries, there has been a rise in people employing domestic staff.

The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections. Proponents of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject. The photograph demonstrates the application of the rule of thirds. The horizon in the photograph sits at the horizontal line dividing the lower third of the photo from the upper two-thirds. The tree sits at the intersection of two lines, sometimes called a power point or a crash point. Points of interest in the photo do not have to actually touch one of these lines to take advantage of the rule of thirds. For example, the brightest part of the sky near the horizon where the sun recently set does not fall directly on one of the lines, but does fall near the intersection of two of the lines, close enough to take advantage of the rule  Use  The rule of thirds is applied by aligning a subject with the guide lines and their intersection points, placing the horizon on the top or bottom line, or allowing linear features in the image to flow from section to section. The main reason for observing the rule of thirds is to discourage placement of the subject at the center, or prevent a horizon from appearing to divide the picture in half. Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, authors of the book An Introduction to Film Analysis: Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film state that the use of rule of thirds is \\"favored by cinematographers in their effort to design balanced and unified images\\" (page 40). When filming or photographing people, it is common to line the body up to a vertical line and the person's eyes to a horizontal line. If filming a moving subject, the same pattern is often followed, with the majority of the extra room being in front of the person (the way they are moving).leadroom Likewise, when photographing a still subject who is not directly facing the camera, the majority of the extra room should be in front of the subject with the vertical line running through their perceived center of mass. A picture cropped without and with the rule of thirds  History  Excerpt from John Thomas Smith's illustrated book, published in 1797, defining a compositional \\"rule of thirds\\" The rule of thirds was first written down by John Thomas Smith in 1797. In his book Remarks on Rural Scenery, Smith quotes a 1783 work by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in which Reynolds discusses, in unquantified terms, the balance of dark and light in a painting. John Thomas Smith then continues with an expansion on the idea, naming it the \\"Rule of thirds\\": > Two distinct, equal lights, should never appear in the same picture : One > should be principal, and the rest subordinate, both in dimension and degree: > Unequal parts and gradations lead the attention easily from part to part, > while parts of equal appearance hold it awkwardly suspended, as if unable to > determine which of those parts is to be considered as the subordinate. \\"And > to give the utmost force and solidity to your work, some part of the picture > should be as light, and some as dark as possible: These two extremes are > then to be harmonized and reconciled to each other.\\" (Reynolds' Annot. on Du > Fresnoy.) > > Analogous to this \\"Rule of thirds\\", (if I may be allowed so to call it) I > have presumed to think that, in connecting or in breaking the various lines > of a picture, it would likewise be a good rule to do it, in general, by a > similar scheme of proportion; for example, in a design of landscape, to > determine the sky at about two-thirds ; or else at about one-third, so that > the material objects might occupy the other two : Again, two thirds of one > element, (as of water) to one third of another element (as of land); and > then both together to make but one third of the picture, of which the two > other thirds should go for the sky and aerial perspectives. This rule would > likewise apply in breaking a length of wall, or any other too great > continuation of line that it may be found necessary to break by crossing or > hiding it with some other object : In short, in applying this invention, > generally speaking, or to any other case, whether of light, shade, form, or > color, I have found the ratio of about two thirds to one third, or of one to > two, a much better and more harmonizing proportion, than the precise formal > half, the too-far-extending four-fifths‚Äîand, in short, than any other > proportion whatever. I should think myself honored by the opinion of any > gentleman on this point; but until I shall by better informed, shall > conclude this general proportion of two and one to be the most pictoresque > medium in all cases of breaking or otherwise qualifying straight lines and > masses and groupes [sic], as Hogarth's line is agreed to be the most > beautiful, (or, in other words, the most pictoresque) medium of curves. Writing in 1845, in his book Chromatics, George Field notes (perhaps erroneously) that Sir Joshua Reynolds gives the ratio 2:1 as a rule for the proportion of warm to cold colors in a painting, and attributes to Smith the expansion of that rule to all proportions in painting: > Sir Joshua has given it as a rule, that the proportion of warm to cold > colour in a picture should be as two to one, although he has frequently > deviated therefrom; and Smith, in his \\"Remarks on Rural Scenery,\\" would > extend a like rule to all the proportions of painting, begging for it the > term of the \\"rule of thirds,\\" according to which, a landscape, having one > third of land, should have two thirds of water, and these together, forming > about one-third of the picture, the remaining two-thirds to be for air and > sky; and he applies the same rule to the crossing and breaking of lines and > objects, &c.; Even at this early date, there was skepticism over the universality of such a rule, at least in regards to color, for Field continues: > This rule, however, does not supply a general law, but universalises a > particular, the invariable observance of which would produce a uniform and > monotonous practice. But, however occasionally useful, it is neither > accurate nor universal, the true mean of nature requiring compensation, > which, in the case of warmth and coolness, is in about equal proportions, > while, in regard to advancing and retiring colours, the true balance of > effect is, approximately, three of the latter to one of the former; > nevertheless, the proportions in both cases are to be governed by the > predominance of light or shade, and the required effect of a picture, in > which, and other species of antagonism, the scale of equivalents affords a > guide. Smith's conception of the rule is meant to apply more generally than the version commonly explained today, as he recommends it not just for dividing the frame, but also for all division of straight lines, masses, or groups. On the other hand, he does not discuss the now-common idea that intersections of the third-lines of the frame are particularly strong or interesting for composition.

History Founded in 1946 by Leonard E. Read, Henry Hazlitt, David Goodrich, Donaldson Brown, Leo Wolman, Fred R. Fairchild, Claude E. Robinson, and Jasper Crane, the foundation is the oldest free-market think tank in the United States. Read served as president from 1946 until his death in 1983. Perry E. Gresham was an interim president in 1983. The presidency of FEE from 1983 to 1984 was held by John Sparks Sr., from 1984 to 1985 by Bob Love, from 1985 to 1988 by a series of acting presidents, then from 1988 to 1992 by Bruce Evans. After retiring from Grove City College where he taught economics, Hans Sennholz served as president from 1992 to 1997. Donald J. Boudreaux served as president from 1997 to 2001, before moving on to chair the Department of Economics at George Mason University. Economist, investment analyst, professor and author Mark Skousen served as president from 2001 to 2002. Author and professor Richard Ebeling served as president from 2003 to 2008. From 2008 to 2019, the president was economist, author, and professor Lawrence W. Reed. The current president is Zilvinas Silvenas, the former president of the Lithuanian Free Market Institute. =Location= FEE first occupied \\"two rooms in the Equitable Building at 737 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan\\" in 1946. Soon after, the organization moved to the mansion on the Hillside estate in Irvington, New York, which Read purchased from Gordon Harris, a son of the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Foundation would remain there for 68 years. In 2014, FEE sold its Irvington headquarters as a part of the transfer of operations to Atlanta, Georgia. =Impact= During his extended graduate studies at Columbia University, Murray Rothbard was influenced by FEE economist Baldy Harper. Rothbard credited FEE with creating a \\"crucial open center\\" for a libertarian movement. Friedrich Hayek saw FEE as part of the inspiration for the formation of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947. Beyond inspiration, FEE provided a financial subsidy to the Mont Pelerin Society. Hayek encouraged Antony Fisher to found the Institute of Economic Affairs after visiting FEE in 1952. Ludwig von Mises had a \\"long-term association with the Foundation for Economic Education.\\" Programs FEE describes its mission as to \\"inspire, educate and connect future leaders with the economic, ethical and legal principles of a free society.\\" FEE offers a variety of programs for high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students. Since 1946 FEE has also sponsored public lectures by various thinkers, including Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, Vernon Smith, Walter Williams, F.A. \\"Baldy\\" Harper, and William F.

The capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana, lies on the river. The Ljubljanica rises south of the town of Vrhnika and flows into the Sava River about downstream from Ljubljana. Its largest affluent is the Mali Graben Canal. Including its source affluent the Little Ljubljanica (), the river is in length. The Little Ljubljanica joins the Big Ljubljanica () after and the river continues its course as the Ljubljanica. The Ljubljanica is the continuation of several karst rivers that flow from the Prezid Karst Field () to Vrhnika on the surface and underground in caves, and so the river is poetically said to have seven names (six name changes): Trbuhovica, Obrh, Str≈æen, Rak, Pivka, Unica, and Ljubljanica. Archaeological significance The Ljubljanica has become a popular site for archaeologists and treasure hunters to dive for lost relics and artifacts. Locations in the river between Ljubljana and Vrhnika have offered up pieces of history from the Stone Age to the Renaissance, belonging to a variety of groups, from local ancient cultures to more well-known groups like the Romans and the Celts.Kaufmann, Carol (Jan 2007). \\"A River's Gifts\\". National Geographic Magazine. 150-7. One of the more significant findings is a yew spearhead, found in 2009 in Sinja Gorica. It has been dated to about 35,000 to 45,000 before present, the Szeletian period, and supplements the scant data about the presence of Stone Age hunters in the Ljubljana Marshes area. Exactly why the Ljubljanica became an article dumping ground is unknown, but most historians believe that it is related to how local tradition has always held the river as a sacred place. These treasures may have been offered \\"to the river during rites of passage, in mourning, or as thanksgiving for battles won.\\" The Ljubljanica has become a popular attraction in Europe for treasure hunters. This has created an ethical debate between local historians and international treasure seekers. It is believed that the river has offered up between 10,000 and 13,000 objects, of which many have been lost to the public. Many pieces have been sold into private collections, or are hidden away by the original treasure hunters. In 2003, to help curb this trend, Slovenia's national parliament declared the river a site of cultural importance and banned diving in it without a permit.

In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and utilizes the Super Scaler arcade system board, created with design input from Suzuki, as technology to simulate 3D effects. The deluxe cabinet version also introduced a motion controlled arcade cabinet, where the player's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character's movements on screen. Yu Suzuki began development of Hang-On after deciding to design a motorcycle racing game as a way to use a torsion bar in an arcade game. With market research suggesting GP 500 racing was popular, Suzuki took inspiration from world champion Freddie Spencer and his style of racing. The game's soundtrack was written by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who used rock music that was uncommon in arcade games at the time. Hang-On was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega. Several sequels were later made for arcade, as well as video game consoles. It received positive critical reception for its realism and graphics, despite some initial modesty concerns in Japan, and has been recognized as a well-remembered and influential arcade game. Gameplay alt=A motorcycle racing down a road Using a behind the motorcycle perspective, the player races a linear race track divided into several stages within a limited time. Players have to lean the motorcycle in order to turn, with tighter corners requiring a further lean. A throttle similar to a motorcycle has to be twisted to accelerate the bike. The game has one track, pieced together in segments. Reaching a checkpoint at the end of each segment extends the time limit, and remaining time is carried over into the next stage. Running off the track results in the motorcycle crashing and the rider is launched into the air. The game ends if the time runs out or all five stages are completed.  Development  alt=A photograph of Yu Suzuki Hang-On was the second game to be developed by Yu Suzuki, the first being 1984's Champion Boxing. Development of Hang-On began with a project brought to him by a colleague who asked him to implement a torsion bar into an arcade game design‚Äîalthough the bar proved too difficult to implement in the final game design and springs were used instead. Suzuki was given the freedom to decide what kind of game to design, and as a fan of cars and motorcycles, he chose to design a game where the arcade cabinet simulated an actual motorcycle and players would have to move side to side on the motorcycle in order to turn. He also had a desire to make his game better than Pole Position, a Namco game which had beaten out Sega's Turbo in popularity. In developing the game, Suzuki wanted to make his new motorcycle racing game a realistic experience. His initial desire was to create a 3D game, though the technology of the time made full 3D environments impossible. Instead, he specified the design of Sega's new Super Scaler arcade system board‚Äîinitially known as Sega Hang-On hardware‚Äîenhanced from the existing VCO Object system board that would utilize multiple CPUs and back end DSP compatibility to create 3D effects, while utilizing 16-bit graphics. The game achieves its 3D effects using a sprite- scaling technique. In designing the game, Suzuki had to decide on a style of motorcycle racing for the game. Suzuki himself was a fan of dirt bikes, along with motocross and Enduro, and dirt bikes would later be used in Suzuki's Enduro Racer. However, Sega's market research concluded that road-based GP 500 racing was more popular worldwide. While Suzuki was doing research for the game, he admired the riding style of Freddie Spencer, who had just become the youngest person to win a motorcycling world championship at 21 years old. According to Suzuki, \\"Freddie Spencer's riding style, it was so nice. And my game was like a homage. That's the reason I wanted to make it - Freddie Spencer, he rode a Honda bike, and I loved the way he hung on!\\" Two cabinet designs were made: a basic version with a handlebar and levers, and the deluxe cabinet which featured the full motorcycle to be tilted. Suzuki had additional features he wanted to implement that could not be done due to cost, including a gyroscope to simulate motorcycle acceleration and deceleration. The title is derived from when the biker is turning and has to \\"hang on\\" to the bike while the bike is leaning, which Suzuki had read in a Japanese bike magazine. Suzuki later learned the technique was called \\"hang off\\" in North America, but he chose to keep the former name. Hang-On is considered well-regarded for its music, which was composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi. He came to Suzuki's attention after Suzuki heard he played in a band. Suzuki wanted songs for the soundtrack to Hang-On that would be like what a band would play. This led to Kawaguchi writing four songs for the game, including \\"Theme of Love\\", the game's theme song. Kawaguchi made use of the hardware's PCM sampling and added drum samples to use Hang-On's Yamaha YM2203 sound chip to its maximum potential and create a more realistic soundtrack featuring rock music, which was uncommon in arcade games at the time. He also created the game's sound effects. Kawaguchi did not program his own music into the game; he instead wrote out his soundtrack by hand, made a demo, and gave that to the sound programmer. He has said this was because he did not own a sequencer, and that this method was faster for him.  Release  alt=An arcade cabinet with handlebars At its debut in Japan, Hang-On's deluxe cabinet was criticized as being inappropriate for Japanese culture. Suzuki recalled in an interview about criticisms about how the shyness of the Japanese people would mean no one would want to straddle a motorcycle in front of others, or how the motorcycle would be especially unsuitable for players wearing miniskirts. These criticisms would eventually subside when players lined up to play the game. In North America, the game was introduced to the public by the company's American arcade subsidiary, Sega Enterprises USA, headed by Tom Petit. Previously, Sega Enterprises USA had focused on selling refurbished arcade cabinets, and before the release of Hang-On, Petit was concerned that his division would be shut down due to competition when he was summoned to Japan to meet with Sega president Hayao Nakayama in 1985. Instead, he was brought to be shown the Hang-On deluxe cabinet. Sega Enterprises USA introduced Hang-On to Sega's American and Canadian distributors at the Red Lion Inn in San Jose, California in October 1985. Orders were placed immediately for several hundred units. The success of Hang-On's arcade cabinets, both upright and deluxe, were so great that the company struggled to keep up with demand.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed Hang-On on their August 1, 1985 issue as being the most- successful upright arcade unit of the year. The game received positive reviews. Computer and Video Games gave the arcade version a rave review. The reviewer called it the most realistic arcade game to be released, citing the need to tilt the bike and the placement of the throttle and brake controls being where they are on a real motorcycle. Also cited were the quality of the graphics, being compared to Pole Position. The same magazine later reviewed the Master System port and scored it positively. Sinclair User commended Hang- On for its simple-yet-fun gameplay, responsive controls, and unique tilt-based arcade cabinet. ACE praised the quality of the Master System conversion, though noted there were some minor graphics jerks compared to the original as well as the loss of the crashing graphics of the arcade version. British magazine Sega Pro called the Master System port \\"a damn fine racing game\\". An SG-1000 exclusive sequel, Hang-On II, was released in 1985, though it was essentially a port of the original game modified to work within the limitations of the console hardware. Another arcade sequel, Hang-On Jr., was published in 1986 for Sega's System E arcade system board. Hang-On itself was ported to the Master System as the system's pack-in game along with Astro Warrior or Safari Hunt depending on the package purchased. In 1987, it was followed by a sequel, Super Hang-On, for arcade and a range of platforms. A polygon-based sequel developed by Genki was released for the Sega Saturn, named Hang-On GP. In a 1995 interview, Suzuki said he felt Hang-On was his most impressive game at the time of release. Retro Gamer cited Hang-On as the first example of a full-body experience game because of the deluxe cabinet's ride-on controls, and noted the game as being popular, though less impressive than Out Run. Former Sega arcade director Akira Nagai has credited Hang-On as one of the titles that helped to bring arcade games out of the 1982 downturn and created new genres of arcade games. According to video game journalist Ken Horowitz, Hang-On is remembered more for its gameplay than its sales, in part because it was unique in arcades at the time, and that it was an example that \\"when it came to arcade innovation, Sega was at the top of the industry.\\"  See also  * Sega AM2 *Power Drift Notes References External links 1985 video games Arcade games Motorcycle video games Racing video games Sega arcade games Sega-AM2 games Sega Games franchises Master System games MSX games NEC PC-8801 games Sega Saturn games SG-1000 games Video games developed in Japan Video games designed by Yu Suzuki Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi ","title":"Hang-On"},{"id":"1389460","text":"Ray Martin may refer to: *Ray Martin (Australian footballer) (1909‚Äì1988), Australian rules footballer *Ray Martin (baseball) (1925‚Äì2013), American baseball player *Ray Martin (English footballer) (born 1945), English association football player *Ray Martin (orchestra leader) (1918‚Äì1988), British orchestra leader *Ray Martin (politician) (born 1941), Canadian politician and former leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party *Ray Martin (pool player) (born 1936), American pool player *Ray Martin (television presenter) (born 1944), Australian journalist/television presenter See also *Raymond Martin (disambiguation) ","title":"Ray Martin"},{"id":"1389461","text":"Jakusho Kwong (born November 14, 1935), born William Kwong, is a Chinese- American Zen Buddhist teacher in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki. He serves as head abbot of Sonoma Mountain Zen Center, of which he is founder. He received the title Dendo Kyoshi (or, Zen teacher) from the Soto School of Japan in 1995. Biography =Early life= Jakusho Kwong was born as William Kwong in Santa Rosa, California, on November 14, 1935. In the 1950s, while studying to be an art teacher at San Jose State University, Kwong was in a car accident that nearly killed him. He took a temporary job as a postman to improve the strength in his legs, which had been badly damaged in the accident. He soon married and took a job as a sign painter, leaving school early due to clashes with his art instructor. Kwong and his wife Laura were looking for an alternative lifestyle at this time, when Bill happened upon an article in a Japanese newspaper with a feature story on Shunryu Suzuki. =Zen practice= In 1960, he began studying Soto Zen with Shunryu Suzuki in San Francisco and became one of his first students. In 1971 Suzuki began preparations to give Dharma transmission to Kwong, having given transmission to Richard Baker that previous year, but Suzuki died soon after without carrying it out. After preparatory study with Kobun Chino, Kwong later completed Dharma transmission with Hoitsu Suzuki, Shunryu Suzuki's son and first dharma heir, in keeping with Suzuki-roshi's intention. In 1973, with Laura (ordination name Shinko) and four sons, Kwong moved to an old farm in Sonoma County, California, with the intention of establishing a meditation center there. The land today encompasses at least eighty-two acres of land, and is known as Sonoma Mountain Zen Center. His son Demian is now a Soto priest active at Genjo-ji.

Usage It is used to correct certain combinations of congenital heart defects (CHDs): # dextro-Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA), or overriding aorta, or double outlet right ventricle (DORV); and # Ventricular septal defect (VSD); and # Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO): ::* pulmonary atresia; or ::* pulmonary stenosis; or ::* subpulmonary stenosis. Timing The Rastelli procedure is typically performed between one and two years of age. Since d-TGA, overriding aorta, and DORV are cyanotic heart defects, the child is palliated with a Blalock-Taussig shunt in the meantime. Method A Gore-Tex patch is used to direct oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, while at the same time closing the VSD. The pulmonary valve is surgically closed and an artificial conduit and valve are constructed from the right ventricle to the pulmonary bifurcation, allowing oxygen depleted blood to travel to the lungs for reoxygenation.

Philip's daughter Rosalind died at a very young age from meningitis, so it was decided that the majority of the Trust's efforts would be directed in helping children. The primary source of funds comes from the annual Boxing Dinner which originally attracted around 250 people. Nearly two decades later it has increased that figure to nearly 1,000 people.

Some species are considered living fossils, with a fossil record that reaches back to the late Carboniferous, . The long lasting resting eggs of one species, Triops longicaudatus, are commonly sold in kits as a pet. In contact with fresh water the animals hatch. Most Triops have a life expectancy of up to 90 days (adult stage only; not including egg period), and can tolerate a pH range of 6‚Äì10. In nature they often inhabit temporary pools.  Relatives and fossil record  The genus Triops can be distinguished from the only other genus of Notostraca, Lepidurus, by the form of the telson (the end of its 'tail'), which bears only a pair of long, thin caudal extensions in Triops, while Lepidurus also bears a central platelike process. Only 24 hours after hatching they already resemble miniature versions of the adult form. Triops are sometimes called \\"living fossils\\", since fossils attributable to this genus have been found in rocks of Carboniferous age, an estimated , and one extant species, Triops cancriformis, has hardly changed since the Jurassic period (approximately ). Triops can be found in Africa, Australia, Asia, South America, Europe (including Great Britain), and in some parts of North America where the climate is right. Some eggs stay unhatched from the previous group and hatch when rain soaks the area. Triops are often found in vernal pools.  Life cycle  Most species reproduce sexually, but some populations are dominated by hermaphrodites which produce internally fertilised eggs. Reproduction in T. cancriformis varies with latitude, with sexual reproduction dominating in the south of its range, and parthenogenesis dominating in the north. Triops eggs enter a state of extended diapause when dry, and will tolerate temperatures of up to for 16 hours, whereas the adult cannot survive temperatures above for 24 hours or for 2 hours. The diapause also prevents the eggs from hatching too soon after rain; the pool must fill with enough water for the dormancy to be broken.  Taxonomy  Closeup of adult Triops showing naupliar ocellus The name Triops comes from the Greek (') meaning \\"three\\" and (') meaning \\"eye\\". The head of T. longicaudatus bears a pair of dorsal compound eyes that lie close to each other and are nearly fused together. The compound eyes are generally sessile (not stalked). In addition, there is a naupliar ocellus (the \\"third eye\\") between them. The compound eyes are on the surface of the head, but the ocellus is deep within the head. All the eyes, however, are easily visible through the shell covering of the head. Franz von Paula Schrank was the first author to use the genus name Triops, coining it in his 1803 work on the fauna of Bavaria. Their German name was ', which means 'three-eye'. He collected and described specimens from the same locality in Regensburg from which Sch√§ffer, another naturalist who had studied the Notostraca, obtained his specimens in the 1750s. However, other authors, starting with Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc, had adopted the genus name Apus for the organisms Schrank had named Triops Ludwig Keilhack used the genus name Triops in his 1909 field identification key of the freshwater fauna of Germany. He suggested that the genus name Apus be replaced by Triops Schrank since an avian genus had already been described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli under the name Apus. However, Robert Gurney preferred the name Apus Sch√§ffer. He suggested that the name '‚Ä¶Triops Schrank, may be returned to the obscurity from which it was unearthed'. This controversy continued and was not resolved until the 1950s. In his 1955 taxonomic review of the Notostraca, Alan R. Longhurst supported Keilhack's genus name Triops over Apus. Longhurst provided historical evidence to support this position. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) followed Longhurst in their 1958 ruling on the usage and origin of the genus names Triops and Apus. They rejected the genus name Apus and instead recognized the genus name Triops Schrank, 1803 (ICZN name no. 1246).

Note that for several of these species there are different varieties, some of which have recently been suggested as subspecies and even separate species. T. longicaudatus, for example, may actually be several species lumped together, and T. cancriformis is generally recognized as having three subspecies: T. cancriformis cancriformis, T. c. mauretanicus, and T. c. simplex.Species list .

It was first discovered in 1831 by naturalist William Cane in Georgian Bay, Parry Sound. This animal is found in northern coniferous and deciduous forests of North America. It is believed to be the second-smallest mammal in the world, but has an extremely large appetite for its size. Due to its fast metabolism, it needs to eat constantly. It digs through moist soils and decaying leaf litter for food.  Description  The American pygmy shrew is the smallest mammal native to North America and is one of the smallest mammals in the world, being just slightly larger than the Etruscan shrew of Eurasia. Its body is about long including a 2-cm-long tail, and it weighs about . Its fur is generally a reddish or grayish brown during the summer, and a white-gray color during the winter. The underside is generally a lighter gray. This animal molts about twice a year, once during late summer, and again during the spring. It has a narrow head with a pointed nose, and whiskers. The eyes are small and well hidden. The primary senses used for hunting are hearing and smell.  Phylogeny  Sorex hoyi was originally placed in the genus Microsorex, which was a subgenus under Sorex until more research had been done. The American pygmy shrew is in the order Soricomorpha and the family Soricidae. Its two closest relatives are the smokey shrew (S. fumes) and the large-toothed shrew (S. macrodon). This genus is believed to have appeared in the late Miocene.  Distribution and habitat  Pygmy shrews are distributed throughout the boreal areas of North America. This ranges from Northern Alaska, to the Rocky Mountains, through the Great Lakes region, to the Appalachians, to the eastern side of Canada. Although S. hoyi prefers moist habitats, it has been recorded to live in areas with both wet and dry soil, but if it is living in a more arid environment, it needs to have a source of water nearby.  Diet  Primarily insectivorous, this animal forages in moist soil and dead leaves to find its prey. Because of the pygmy shrew's small size, its diet primarily consists of insects and insect larvae, while the larger shrews eat insects and worms. Its diet is almost exclusively protein-based. To stay alive, the pygmy shrew has to eat three times its body weight daily, which means capturing prey every 15 to 30 minutes, day and night; a full hour without food means certain death. Because of this high metabolism, the pygmy shrew never sleeps more than a few minutes at a time, as it is in a constant search for food. Although due to its small body size it is always losing body heat, being small has its advantages during the winter when food is scarce. Predators of the American pygmy shrew include hawks, brook trout, owls, snakes, and domestic cats.  Lifecycle and reproduction  Little is known about the reproductive cycle of pygmy shrews. They appear to mate year round, with a bias of births occurring from November through March. The gestation period is estimated to last about 18 days. Females produce a litter of three to eight young, and only give birth once a year. The age the young are weaned is not known with certainty, but by 18 days old, they are nearly full grown, and are usually independent by 25 days. Being mammals, the mother nourishes her young with milk. The maximum lifespan of a pygmy shrew is not known, but it is believed to be about 16‚Äì17 months.  Behavior  Pygmy shrews dig through soil and leaf litter to search for food, and can use tunnel networks created by other animals to aid in that search. They do not sleep or rest for extended periods of times, but alternate between rest and activity all day and night, showing a bias towards nighttime. They have keen senses of smell and hearing to help them find prey. When feeling threatened or scared, the shrews make a sharp squeaking noise and run for cover. Shrews can also swim, which makes them prey to brook trout. Pygmy shrews are in constant motion, and captured shrews have been observed \\"climbing and walking upside down on the wire top of the cage.\\"  Physiology  Due to its high metabolism, the pygmy shrew is active year-round and does not engage in any form of torpor. Shrews have been known to burrow through snow to find food, showing that winter snow does not stop them. Although usually a positive correlation exists between latitude and shrew body size, the American pygmy shrew is an exception. Although it is constantly losing body heat because it is so small, it also benefits from this because to generate that energy takes less food than it would for a larger shrew.

Originally developed by the Soviet Union under the GRAU designation 9K31, it is commonly known by its NATO reporting name, SA-9 \\"Gaskin\\". The system consists of a BRDM-2 amphibious vehicle, mounting two pairs of ready-to-fire 9M31 missiles. Development history The missiles used in this system were developed alongside the ubiquitous Soviet MANPADS 9K32M \\"Strela-2\\" (NATO designation SA-7 \\"Grail\\") in the 1960s. At first both missiles were intended to be man-portable systems, but as it became obvious that Strela-2 would be far the more compact of the two systems, the development goals of Strela-1 were changed. Instead of a battalion-level man- portable system the new criteria called for a regimental vehicle-mounted SAM to support the ZSU-23-4. As a result of the change in role and more relaxed weight limits of a vehicle-mounted SAM, the design team made the 9M31 a much heavier missile, which permitted fewer design compromises than in the case of Strela-2 to achieve acceptable kinematic performance. The most notable difference is the much larger diameter of the missile and a blunt seeker head that occupies the full width of the missile body. With all else being equal, the ability of an optical seeker to detect a target is directly proportional to its diameter, but on the other hand aerodynamic drag increases proportionally to the square of the diameter. The Strela-1 also had a warhead over twice as heavy, a proximity fuze and more effective control surface configuration to provide better maneuverability at the cost of increased drag. The net result was a missile four times the weight of Strela-2, with only slightly longer reach but otherwise of much better performance. Vehicle Each TEL carries four ready-to fire missiles, but typically no missiles for reloading. Reloading is performed manually and usually takes approximately 5 minutes. The missile boxes are lowered for transport to lower the total height of the vehicle. The driver and commander have periscopes for viewing outside the vehicle when the hatches are closed. 9K31 TEL w/\\"Flat Box\\" passive radar detection array. Photo by GulfLINK. Apart from the new turret, the other major change to the BRDM-2 chassis is the removal of the belly wheels (which are presumably to improve off-road performance). The driver and commander both have infra-red vision systems. The vehicle has standard NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) protection including overpressure. The missiles fold down to the sides of the turret which greatly reduces the height of the vehicle whilst travelling. Each vehicle weighs around 7 tonnes (7.7 short tons) and has a 104 kW (140 hp) engine and a central tire pressure control system. Missiles and guidance =9M31= According to a number of Russian sources the original 9M31 (US DoD designation SA-9A \\"Gaskin-Mod0\\") had a zone of reliable target destruction from 900 to 4200 metres. Several western and also some Russian sources give much higher range estimates of 800 to 6500 m (0.5 to 4 miles); these may refer to maximum firing range against an approaching target and minimum against receding, which are obviously larger envelopes as the target only has to reach the intercept zone by the time the missile would reach it. The missile is effective against targets receding at a maximum speed of 220 m/s, or approaching at 310 m/s. The warhead was primarily intended to impact the target directly, and had contact and magnetic fuzes, but also contained a back-up optical proximity fuze to detonate the warhead in case of a near miss. The missile also had an unusual safety mechanism in case of a miss; rather than a self-destruct fuze, if the optical fuze didn't detect a target within 13‚Äì16 seconds, the warhead safety mechanism would be engaged to prevent its detonation upon impact. Propulsion is by a single-stage Solid- fuel rocket motor, which is ignited at a distance of few meters from the launch tube: as the throw-out charge ejects the missile from its canister, it is trailing a wire from its rear. The main rocket ignites when missile reaches the wire's end at a few metres distance, and is cut off from it. The seeker head is an unusual construction, using uncooled lead sulphide (PbS) detector elements, but with an unusual tracking mechanism. Uncooled PbS elements are commonly used to detect radiation at only short wavelengths of less than 2 micrometers. Only very hot objects emit strongly at such short wavelengths, limiting heat-seeking systems using uncooled PbS detector elements to rear- hemisphere engagements against jet targets, although propeller-driven aircraft and helicopters can of course be engaged from any direction from which the exhaust or other very hot parts of the engine are visible. The seeker head of 9M31, however, utilizes the PbS elements differently from usual. Taking advantage of the fact that the clear sky gives strong and constant background emission at below 2 micrometer range, peaking at visual light (0.4 to 0.7 micrometer) wavelengths at which PbS in 295 kelvins temperature still provides a response, the seeker head is used to track a change of radiation from the target compared to the background. The method is called optical photocontrast homing (Rus.: —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ). The advantage of photocontrast homing method over traditional heat-seeking homing heads using PbS elements is that it negates the most serious drawback of early-generation IR-homing missiles: complete lack of front-aspect engagement capability against approaching jets. Even early cooled seeker heads had usually only limited forward hemisphere engagement abilities, often reducing to zero in case of jets approaching exactly towards the shooter. The new photo-contrast seeker had its own serious limits also, however, which came in the form of rather strict meteorological conditions that had to be met in order to enable the seeker to detect and track the target: it could only engage targets against background conditions of either clear sky or solid overcast, minimum of 20 degrees away from the sun, and at least 2 degrees above horizon. Nonetheless, following a study of battlefield conditions and aircraft tactics in past conflicts where short-range air defences had been used, it was concluded that conditions allowing the use of such homing system were common enough to make it a cost-effective design choice and a better trade-off than the only practical alternative available at the time, which was infrared homing restricted to rear-hemisphere engagements. The fact that Strela-1 would be supplemented by IR-homing Strela-2 and radar-controlled ZSU-23-4 self- propelled AA gun system may have influenced the decision in favour of such an unusual homing system. The main advantage of the choice was that it made Strela-1 the only ADA system in the Soviet tank or motor rifle regiment that could engage approaching targets out to a range of several kilometers ‚Äì the ZSU being hampered by very short range, and Strela-2 by its limitation to tail-chase engagements of ground attack jets, after the jet had already delivered its attack. =9M31M= While the 9M31 was accepted to service after state trials in 1968, the trials committee also suggested improvements that should be incorporated into the weapon as soon as possible. As a result of these improvements the 9M31M \\"Strela-1M\\" (US DoD designation SA-9B \\"Gaskin- Mod1\\") entered service in 1970. The new version introduced many slight improvements in performance characteristics of the missile: it had a slightly heavier warhead, more accurate guidance system to increase the probability of direct impacts, and extended range. Range is again reported to be as high as 8000 m (0.35 to 5 miles) in a number of western and also a few Russian sources, whereas for example Petukhov & Shestov, Lappi, and a number Russian web sources give much more modest performance figures; considering the performance of similar systems, at least an intercept range of 8000 m seems unlikely for such a small, high-drag missile design. Deployment The Strela-1 was deployed in short-range air defense batteries of Soviet motor rifle and tank regiments. The battery consisted of a gun platoon of four ZSU-23-4 Shilkas, and a SAM platoon with four Strela-1 vehicles. The Strela-1 platoon contains, in addition to a command vehicle, one TEL fitted with a passive radar detection system similar to a Radar Warning Receiver, and several more (usually three) without any radar system. The radar detection system is the 9S16 \\"Flat Box\\" and consists of four sensors mounted around the BRDM vehicle giving it 360 degree coverage. This system emits no radar energy but can detect radio waves emitted from aircraft, giving the vehicle warning about incoming aircraft and aiding in the acquisition of the target aircraft with the optical system.

Greiz is situated in eastern Thuringia on the river White Elster. As with other nearby settlements, the place name (originally Grouts) is of Slavic origin and means Gradec. It was first mentioned in 1209. The prime location of Greiz at the river White Elster and the stream G√∂ltzsch made it a fast-growing town. It kept expanding during the last 1000 years. It has been recognized as town in the 13th century for the first time. Later the House of Reuss, a ruling German dynasty, built 2 castles in Greiz: the \\"Oberes Schloss\\" (Upper castle) and the \\"Unteres Schloss\\" (Lower castle). Both were built by famous architects and are still considered unique. Greiz became the capital of the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (until 1918). Greiz town center Greiz has a large park in its center (F√ºrstlich Greizer Park) which is classified as an English garden. Thomasstra√üe, Burgstra√üe, Marktstra√üe, Waldstra√üe, and Leonhardtstra√üe with their Jugendstil houses are well known examples of that architectural style. In Prof.-Dr.-Friedrich-Schneider-Stra√üe 4 there is one of the earliest examples of Art Deco architecture (built in 1911). During World War II, Greiz did not suffer much damage, although 3 of the 5 bridges in town were destroyed. In 1941, Ulf Merbold was born there, who became in 1983 the first astronaut from the Federal Republic of Germany (Sigmund J√§hn, born only away, was the first German space traveller, representing the German Democratic Republic in 1978 as a cosmonaut). Greiz has a population of about 20,524 people (as of December 31, 2018). The former municipality Neum√ºhle/Elster was merged into Greiz in December 2019. In addition to a chemical works and a paper factory there are mechanical engineering operations, plastics manufacturing businesses, wood machining enterprises, medical technology, suppliers to the automobile industry, printing houses and breweries. In recent years various high tech businesses (sensor technology, climate simulators, micro-chip production) and environmental technology companies developed.

In 1994, the town hosted the 34th Hessentag state festival. Geography =Location= Gro√ü-Gerau lies in the north of the Hessisches Ried, the northeastern section of the Rhine rift. =Neighbouring communities= Gro√ü-Gerau borders in the north on the community of Nauheim, in the northeast on the town of M√∂rfelden-Walldorf, in the east on the community of B√ºttelborn, in the southeast on the town of Griesheim (Darmstadt-Dieburg), in the south on the community of Riedstadt and in the west on the community of Trebur. =Constituent communities= Gro√ü-Gerau consists of the centres of Berkach, Dornberg, Dornheim, Auf Esch, Gro√ü-Gerau and Wallerst√§dten. History Already by Roman times, the area forming today's town of Gro√ü- Gerau had great importance. A fort in the area of the constituent community of Auf Esch ensured a bridgehead for the Roman provincial capital of Moguntiacum (Mainz), even before the Limes was established and southern Hesse became Roman. Federal Highway (Bundesstra√üe) B44 from the southern tip of the old pheasantry (at Auf Esch) to Dornheim corresponds exactly with the old Roman road from Mainz through Gro√ü-Gerau to Ladenburg. It led to the fort's south gate. With the founding of the Civitas Auderiensium (Dieburg), the fort was forsaken. The camp (vicus) remained and became a market village. The fact that this vicus and the later mentioned Wasserburg Dornberg (moat-ringed castle) corresponded very closely in location would be no accident. The Gerauer Mark (Gerau March, the woods between Wallerst√§dten and Messel) had its first documentary mention in one of Mainz Archbishop Hatto I's donation documents in 910. In the time that followed, the Lords of Dornberg, held sway in the region, likely doing so as the Hohenstaufen emperors' vassals in the Frankfurt Palatinate (in 1160, a moat-ringed castle is mentioned in what is now the Dornberg area). After the Lords of Dornberg died out came the Counts of Katzenelnbogen as their successors. The new overlords managed to procure town rights for Gro√ü-Gerau in 1398. In 1479, Count Philip the Elder died without a male heir and the county passed to Hesse. In 1578, building work on the Town Hall was begun. This was where the Sch√∂ffengericht (\\"Jurymen's Court\\") and the Schulthei√üen (roughly \\"sheriffs\\") appointed by the Landgraves sat. Gro√ü- Gerau's town church was burnt down in 1634 by Imperial troops during the Thirty Years' War. Landgrave Ludwig VI of Hesse-Darmstadt renewed Gro√ü-Gerau's town rights in 1663 for a payment of 24000 Gulden. These rights included the abolition of compulsory labour, market stall levies, representation in the Landtag and the right to drive Jews out of the town. In the 19th century, industrialization began in Gro√ü-Gerau, too, as elsewhere. Given the connection to the Hessische Ludwigsbahn (railway) with the Darmstadt-Mainz stretch in 1858 and the Frankfurt am Main-Mannheim stretch in 1879 (the Riedbahn), a multifaceted industrial life sprang up. The town became headquarters to metalworking businesses (FAGRO), canneries (Helvetia), cheesemakers (Gro√ü- Gerau is where \\"Mainz\\" cheese is made) and the sugar industry. From 1869 to 1871, Gro√ü-Gerau was the epicentre of a series of mostly weak earthquakes. A plan to connect two local railway stations and the surrounding communities together with a tramway in the late 19th century fell through, and there are still no trams in the town even now. Recently, the town's, and more particularly the district's economic situation has worsened. Relatively high debt loads and strict controls of public institutions (especially at the district level) by the government presidium in Darmstadt have led to this. The name Gro√ü-Gerau means \\"Great Gerau\\", and the town shares its name with the village of Klein-Gerau ‚Äì \\"Small Gerau\\" ‚Äì a constituent community of B√ºttelborn. =Population development= () * 1998 - 23,000 * 1999 - 23,147 * 2000 - 23,349 * 2001 - 23,342 * 2002 - 23,565 * 2003 - 23,600 * 2004 - 23,519 * 2017 - 25,496 Politics Old Town Hall =Town council= Gro√ü-Gerau's council is made up of 33 councillors, with seats apportioned thus, in accordance with municipal elections held on 6 March 2016: (in parentheses changes from municipal elections held in March 2011): * SPD 10 seats (-1) * CDU 10 seats (-1) * Greens 4 seats (-3) * KOMBI 3 seats (-) * Left Party 2 seats (+1) * Free Democratic Party 2 seats (+2) * Free Voters 2 seats (+2) =Executive and mayor= The executive of the district town of Gro√ü-Gerau consists of the directly elected mayor, the honorary first town councillor, a full-time town councillor and a further five honorary town councillors.

The crest: a crenellated wall with three crenellated towers Or. Gro√ü-Gerau's oldest known town seal dates from the 16th century. There are none surviving from the time when town rights were first granted in 1398. The seal in question shows a cabbage and an onion, perhaps symbolizing horticulture's importance in the area. The cross first appeared about 1600 in combination with the vegetables, and this new symbol was used in town seals and on buildings. It is unknown why the cross came to be in the town's seal. It is also seen on a municipal limit marker from 1596, but without the produce. The arms were granted in 1901, and also include the lion of Hesse in the chief. The arms shown in this article and on the town's official website include the crest consisting of a crenellated castle wall with three crenellated towers.

History The settlement of Hilteburgehusin was first mentioned in a 1234 deed, when the Counts of Henneberg sold it to the Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg. Repurchased in 1316, the Henneberg lords vested the citizens with town privileges in 1324 and had city walls erected. In 1353 the estates of Hildburghausen were inherited by the Wettin landgrave Frederick III of Thuringia and upon the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig became part of the Ernestine duchies. In 1528 the Hildburghausen citizens turned Protestant. The town fell to the newly established Duchy of Saxe-Coburg in 1572 and upon the extinction of the line in 1638 passed to the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. In 1680 it became the residence of the Ernestine dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen until its dissolution in 1826, after which it passed to the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen.

It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R√≠o de la Plata basin. It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus. Appearance and anatomy The adult size is 6¬Ω cm for males and a slightly larger 7 cm for females (2¬Ω to 2¬æ inches).Dawes, John. \\"The Complete Encyclopedia of the Freshwater Aquarium\\". Interpet Publishing, 2001, p. 137. Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue- grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species. Ecology They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters. In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25 ¬∞C to 28 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F to 82 ¬∞F), pH 6.0‚Äì8.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH. Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent. It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals. It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. =Reproduction= Albino Corydoras aeneus spawning Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry. Females spawn 10‚Äì20 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male. In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \\"T-position\\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior. In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds. Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency. The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives. In the aquarium Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species. It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed. They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank. Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28 ¬∞C (68 to 82 ¬∞F), pH of 6.0‚Äì8.0, and hardness of 2‚Äì30 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it. A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28 ¬∞C to a week at 20 ¬∞C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. Albino corydoras =Albino corydoras= The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes. It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop. Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding. Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \\"painting\\" or \\"juicing\\" fish.

It is situated a few miles to the west of Darlington, on the north bank of the River Tees between Piercebridge to the west, and High Coniscliffe to the east. High and Low Carlbury once constituted a slightly larger settlement, but most of the hamlet at Low Carlbury became derelict and was demolished by the late 1940s. A few buildings remain. History In 1320 Carlbury was given by the widow of Sir John FitzMarmaduke, Sheriff of North Durham, to Sir Thomas Earl of Lancaster and Leicester. After Sir Thomas was executed for treason in 1322, Carlbury went back to the widow's family and thence to the House of Neville. Carlbury consisted historically of High and Low Carlbury and was included with Summerhouse and Ulnaby in the estate of the Nevilles in their capacity as Earls of Westmorland from 1354 to 1601, being mentioned in a 1553 document. However Charles Neville forfeited it in 1571 for his part in the Rising of the North. Queen Elizabeth I granted it to Ralph Taylboys or Tailboys of Thornton Hall in 1573; it was then left to Thomas Jenison in 1580 and to William Jenison in 1588. Carlbury still belonged to the Jenisons in 1616. The estate later came into the hands of Childers Welbank Childers of York, who sold it to London merchant George Bainbridge who was born in 1740. At that time Carlbury maintained its own roads and its own poor independently of the parish. Workers by the names of Kipling in the 18th century and Cowley in the 19th century are recorded. An old spelling of the name of this area was Kerleburie. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, Carlbury was well-populated with families of numerous surnames. By the 19th century it was a hamlet at the foot of Carlbury Bank, served by the Piercebridge railway station which was on the NER Darlington and Barnard Castle railway (1858‚Äì1964). In the hamlet was the Railway Inn, the fairly large Bridge House, and Carlbury's own bridge over Dyance Beck, which in turn powered Carlbury Mill. The mill burned down at night in 1889, discovered by a hapless cyclist who, despite great effort by telegraph from Piercebridge and then by pedalling to Darlington, was unable to raise the fire brigade in time to save the mill. The hamlet was mostly derelict by 1939, and all but a few buildings were demolished after World War II in the 1940s before the A67 was built. =Carlbury Hill and Carlbury Hall= During the Civil War on 1 December 1642 a contingent of Royalists, led by the Earl of Newcastle and travelling south along Dere Street, met a group of Parliamentarians, led by Captain Hotham and travelling north, in a dispute over the bridge at Piercebridge. The Royalists won the day by erecting a battery on Carlbury Hill, which higher position had an advantage over the opposition's battery on the other side of the river. Cannonballs and human bones from this battleground have been found on the banks of the river. On 9 December 1672, Jane Hill fell from the hill and died four days afterwards. In 1875 on that same Carlbury Hill, architect John Ross built Carlbury Hall in Scots baronial style for National Provincial Bank manager Thomas McLachlan; McLachlan is said to have chosen the site where the view of the River Tees would remind him of Scotland. By 1905 Carlbury Hall was in the hands of James Backhouse Dale (born 1855), a company director of Hordern Collieries Ltd, and between 1909 and 1929 it was owned by John Henry Pease, a member of Cleveland Naturalists' Field Club. In 2003 it sold for ¬£535,000. Barrow =Archaeology= Smotherlaw Barrow is a scheduled monument which was thought to be the site of a castle in 1902, although by 1992 it was understood to be an elongated mound without a ditch, reduced by ploughing and probably a Bronze Age burial mound. Mortaria dated around 170‚Äì180 AD with painted inscriptions have been found in Carlbury Vale west, and they could be associated with Piercebridge Roman Fort. Carlbury today High Carlbury Farm In 2005‚Äì2006, Carlbury still had 3.5 hectares of ancient woodland, classified as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance and a wildlife corridor. Today High Carlbury is Carlbury Farm, and the remainder of Low Carlbury is next to the A67 road where there is Carlbury Hall. For a short time in the early 21st century this was a nursing home on Carlbury Hill. Also on the A67 is the Carlbury Arms which is listed by CAMRA and has a pudding club, and the Carlbury milestone which is Grade II listed but said to be in poor condition. However, in 2005 Darlington Council saw fit to upgrade the bus shelters at the Carlbury Arms and Carlbury Hall stops. Carlbury Garden Centre is north of the Carlbury Arms, on Station Road. Between the milestone and the river there is a field and a little bridge over stone channels where the mill race once was; Carlbury Bridge is now a Grade II listed building. The hamlet is on the Piercebridge Circular Walk route. Carlbury Hill, site of English Civil War cannon emplacement, viewed from south bank of River Tees. Carlbury Hall (b. 1875) can be seen on top.

Biography H√∏len railroad bridge in Akershus Minnesund railway bridge in Eidsvoll Petersson was born in √ñland in 1834. He studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm between 1852 and 1855. He worked for the Swedish Canal Administration and later for a private railway in Sweden. He moved to Norway in 1859, after he was hired as an assistant engineer for the construction of the Kongsvinger Line. By 1865 he was hired as the chief of the Railway Construction Office. He was responsible for construction of bridges and viaducts on the √òstfold Line and the Dovre Line between Eidsvoll and Hamar. By 1881 Peterson had poor health and retired. He died on 15 January 1884 in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. There was a story that stayed around for a long time that the constructor of the Ljan Viaduct had committed suicide before its opening because he did not trust it to stand. Geir-Wider Lang√•rd has proposed that this folklore arose with the magnitude of the bridge combined with the Tay Bridge disaster in Scotland which killed 75 people when it collapsed the same year as the Ljan Viaduct opened in 1879. Works Some of the larger constructions were Minnesund Railway Bridge (Minnesund Jernbanebru), Ljan Viaduct (Ljansbroen), H√∏len Viaduct (H√∏len viadukt) and Sarp Bridge (Sarpsbroene). Petersson invented the pendular pillar principle, which was first applied on H√∏len Viaduct. Petersson also made a series of other inventions. He developed a rotating camera and calculating machines.

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 726. It is situated a few miles (several km) to the north-west of Stockton-on-Tees, a short distance from the village of Redmarshall.  History  Although subject to much new building in the past decade, the village still retains its medieval layout, with houses facing each other across the main street, and with strips of land in front and behind. This layout had been identified as Norman, probably dating to the rebuilding of the village after William's harrying of the North.Carlton aerial photograph The origin of the village of Carlton lies in the remote past, the pattern of the village was probably determined in the 11th or 12th century when estate re-organisation was commenced. Kirk Hill, Carlton, County Durham. It is part of the ecclesiastical parish of Redmarshall which came under the auspices of the Bishop of Durham, and is situated north of the River Tees, about 5 miles to the west of Stockton-on-Tees, and until boundary re- organisation in 1972 was part of the County of Durham. It is 160 ft. above sea level, and was essentially a small agricultural village, the farmhouses and cottages built on either side of the main village street, probably an old drovers road, with a slow flowing stream running alongside the south of the settlement. In 1200 AD, Bishop Pudsey of Durham caused a survey (the earliest record) to be made of all his possessions, this included Carlton, in which there were 23 farmers, a miller, and that William, son of Orm of Carlton, had to come to the great chase of the Lord Bishop with one greyhound whenever required. Towards the end of the 14th century there were 124 residents and at that time tenants had a common bakehouse, the lease being two shillings paid to the Bishop. Life in Carlton until the beginning of the 20th century was very different and much harder than that enjoyed by residents today. The only water supply was from the village pump, situated in the centre of the village, piped water was installed in about 1895, although the village pump was still in general use many years later. Transport and travel was by foot or horsepower until the introduction of the railway to the east of the village, when a railway station (originally named Carlton Station) was constructed in about 1850. Once the Carlton Station was operating it became the local centre of industry, with goods trains, chemical works, coal depot and passenger trains. Houses and cottages were built for the workers, many of whom were housed in the village, this increased the population considerably at this time. Farmers used the railway regularly to send their milk to the dairies in the town, cows were milked, milk cooled and measured into churns and transported by horsepower to catch a train due before 7:00 a.m. so that it could be delivered at its destination fresh for breakfast. A bus service was introduced in the 1920s; initially the bus ran only twice a week, market day and Saturday. This has now developed into an hourly service every weekday. Many changes in the way of life in Carlton have taken place in recent years, and are often described as 'before' or 'after' the war (1939‚Äì45). During the 19th century, travelling men with stallions used to visit the village to 'service' the mares owned by local farmers. As the horse was the predominant method of transport of the day, the travelling men would stay overnight at a farm in the village before going on to the next stop. The horse and cart mode of travel gradually gave way to the motor vehicle during the 20th century, and today the village is troubled with increasing traffic, some exceeding the 30 m.p.h. speed limit which was introduced in 1978. Up until the advent of the 'combine', a steam thrashing machine travelled the area, spending a day at each farm thrashing the corn. Thrashing day was a big event on the farms; about 20 local men and women worked on the thrasher starting about 6.00 a.m. until dark. The farmer's wife had a busy day starting with breakfast (traditional), ten o'clocks, dinner (roast beef) and three o'clocks, plenty of good food for such hard work. Before the war there were many natural landmarks, which have now disappeared. There were well used footpaths around the village, about five duck ponds, orchards, trees and hedgerows. Progress meant that roads had to be widened and old property demolished, but village greens are still very pleasantly established, lately enhanced by bulbs planted by residents and regularly maintained by the Stockton Borough Council. Services are held each Sunday in the Methodist Chapel, built in 1871, which stands in a prominent position at the east end of the village at the junction of the roads leading to Stockton and Thorpe Thewles. A public house 'The Smiths Arms' stands well in the centre of the village built in about 1900 (by Irish labourers lodged in the village) to replace an ancient inn nearby. Previously the South Durham Hunt used to partake of the 'Stirrup Cup' and meet here twice in the season. The Blacksmiths Shop, now the restaurant, situated next to the bar was a centre of activity in the village, gossip was exchanged, and horses shoed. Although the village was originally a farming community with associated small industries, 'before the war' there were five working traditional farms and now only one such farm is left. Children from the village attended the local church school at Redmarshall until it was closed in 1966, when a new primary school was built at Bishopton. In 1928, a group of ladies, headed by the stationmaster's wife, held a meeting to form a Women‚Äôs Institute. Many functions were held to raise money to build the hall which was completed in 1936, and which has been a great asset to both the Women‚Äôs Institute and the local community. During the war soldiers were billeted in the hall Red Cross lectures were given to volunteer First Aid workers, and over the years it has been in great demand by the cricket club (now defunct) & youth clubs etc. The first post office to be established was in 1933, when a room in a local cottage was converted for this use. The post office is now located in Carlton Village Stores. The arrival of the public telephone was much later. There is local knowledge of a small shop at Middle Farm at the beginning of the century, & later at what is now called Glenesk Cottage. Travelling salesmen were the order of the day, until the advent of the motor car. Fruit and fishmen and butchers came weekly by horse and cart. In 1939, a committee was formed to help the National War effort, work was put in by local inhabitants to raise funds. A strong community spirit prevailed during the war and the local contingents of Home Guard, Special Constables, Fire Brigade and Red Cross were well supported. There is no record of any serious crime in the parish, probably that is why there was never any resident village 'Bobby'. Christmas Eve 1935 was a momentous day for Carlton. The electricity was switched on and things were never the same again, candles and oil lamps were thrown away. Street lighting was installed in 1963. A fairly recent addition is the playing field, established in 1975, and donated to the parish by the late Mr. Fred Hall, a local farmer, whose ancestors can be traced back to the 18th century in the area. A Parish Council was formed in 1956, taking the place of the old parish meeting, It consists of seven members. Meetings are held once a month in the Chapel school room when matters of local interest are debated and discussed. In the original village there are many old properties including some which are 'listed'. In recent years new residential development has taken place which has dramatically increased the population. The situation of the rural Village of Carlton, so near to the large industrial area of Teesside has made it a convenient and desirable residential district. Carlton was for many years part of the Rural District of Stockton-on-Tees which was in 1972 amalgamated into the new County of Cleveland. The population in 1841 was 157, and in 1990 it was 550. A strong community spirit still prevails, primarily through the efforts of the Women‚Äôs Institute, the Church, and the chapel.  Economy  Located within the village are Carlton Village Stores and \\"The Smiths\\", a family-run bar-restaurant (previously the Smiths Arms). The Smiths features in the 2006 Good Beer Guide, selling Deuchars IPA and a guest beer, usually from a big brewer, which changes every few weeks. It is the only pub in the local villages to have retained a two-room layout, with a separate public bar (including wide-screen, usually featuring music channels, unless sport is on) and a critically acclaimed restaurant.  Public services  The village is home to a sports field with children's play area, a village green, WI hall, a chapel and a post office. Notable people George Orwell resided at Greystone, the home of his wife Eileen's sister-in-law and about half a mile outside the village, from 1944‚Äì1945.Is this where Orwell created Big Brother? He moved there with Eileen and newly adopted son, Richard, following bomb damage to their London flat. The then housekeeper, Mrs Blackburn, remembers Orwell reading in the garden or sitting in the bay window of the drawing-room reading or making notes. This room overlooked Whitton valley, made up of rural farmland with woodland in the distance, as well as the Whitton Bridge Pasture. It was here that Orwell finished his anti- Stalinist allegory Animal Farm before leaving for France as a war correspondent in 1945. Mary Elizabeth Andrew, lifelong resident of Carlton, served as clerk to the parish council for 62 years, 1938‚Äì2000. There is a commemorative bench and stone on the greens in the village.

Betinho Prize The Betinho Prize is offered by the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) in the field of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Says the APC: \\"The Internet has not yet been converted into a giant online shopping mall. There are thousands of projects big and small working online around the world that prove that the Internet can be, and is being, used as a powerful tool for development and social justice.\\" Its goal is to focus on \\"exceptional and sometimes little known initiatives\\". In 2003 and 2005 the Betinho Prize is offered in recognition of outstanding examples of ICT use specifically based in Latin America and the Caribbean. Applications are accepted in some of the most widely used languages in the region‚ÄîSpanish, Portuguese and English. In 2005, the last date for applying was October 16, 2005. This year's subject is \\"community connectivity projects for economic development\\". Contribution over HIV/AIDS issue Betinho's contribution in the fight against the HIV/AIDS is considered to be immense. In an article, the general former-coordinator of the Abia, Jane Galv√£o, remembers some of the actions of the sociologist in this front: the creation of the Abia, a multidiscipline and multi-sectoral reply to HIV/AIDS; the pressure against the commerce of blood and its derivatives; and the fight for access to medicines. According to some who appreciate his role, the eyes of Betinho were as \\"lighthouses that guided and illuminated ways to be trod\\". In a 1994 article, for example, Betinho anticipated one of the main trends of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil: its pauperisation. Awards and recognition On November 12, 2014 the Brazilian Congress voted to honor Betinho by changing the name of the bridge linking Rio de Janeiro and Niter√≥i from Costa e Silva to Betinho.

The population of the village at the 2011 census was 642. It is situated a short distance to the south of Peterlee, Wingate, Hutton Henry, the A19 and Castle Eden Dene. The village is famous for the former Castle Eden Brewery which was home of the famous Castle Eden Ale; most of it was demolished in 2003 for a new housing estate and only the main front building remains today. This is a listed building and is now managed office space with a popular Italian restaurant. The A19 used to run through the village until it was bypassed in the 1970s. The deep and impressive nearby dene extends all the way to sea, and its many yew trees are a particular feature where they find the dolomite soil advantageous. Etymology Castle Eden takes its name from the Eden Burn that runs through it. Eden is a fairly common outcome in English of a Brittonic river name that can be reconstructed as *ituna ('to gush forth').Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html). The name is first attested around 1050 as Geodene and Iodene,Mawer, Allen, The Place-Names of Northumberland and Durham (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1920), p. 71. both representing the pronunciation .  History  Both the Domesday Book of 1086 and the King's Book record Castle Eden as a small village, but make no mention of any castle. In 1764, the estate of Castle Eden was purchased by Rowland Burdon from William Turner, in which the deeds describe a pathway passing a ruined medieval chapel across a bridge and through the village leading up to the ruined manor and castle. It is commonly considered that this is the area named \\"The Village\\", and that the parish church of St James, Castle Eden (Parish of Monk Hesleden) was built on the site of the chapel mentioned. St James' Church was closed in 2016 due to a diminishing congregation, and its building put up for sale. In the 1760s, a farm labourer digging out a hedge discovered a fine glass beaker, known as \\"The Castle Eden Beaker\\". It now resides in the British Museum. The Castle\\", an 18th-century mansion Rowland Burdon returned to the estate in 1766 to work on \\"The Castle\\" as it became named, adding the present Regency Gothic wing. Sir John Soane, renowned Regency architect, visited the completed castle on his way from another project. He drafted plans, proposing a potential Neoclassical remodelling of the structure. Burdon in the end chose not to commission him. The Nimmo family would go on in 1826 to found what would come to be known as the Castle Eden Brewery, trading as J. Nimmo and Son Limited. Other families such as the Savilles owned their rope works and bleachery for sail cloth manufacturing, making the village, at the start of the 19th century, a fairly industrious one. However, as with so many similar sites, as the Victorian era moved on, so did much of the industry. In the course of the 19th century, the village became much expanded but still lowly populated and spread out. It was served by the Castle Eden Railway and railway station, a police station and a magistrates' court. These were all closed in the 1960s, and their buildings demolished. The village also had its own primary school, but it was closed in the 1970s. Until the 1980s, the village still had a post office, which subsequently closed, leaving the Castle Eden Inn, the cricket club, the golf club and the village hall as the only amenities. In 1998, the national brewer Whitbreads, which had purchased the brewery from the Nimmo family in the 1960s, announced its closure. For a short while, brewing continued there but the site was finally sold and, in 2003, redeveloped as houses. The only evidence that the brewery existed is the fine roadside Victorian fa√ßade, which was retained.

The Causey Arch  Around the Causey are a lot of ravines, valleys and denes, these are a relic of the ice age. The arch was built to cross one of these ravines. They had built a bridge of wood in 1725 which collapsed. A new bridge was built in 1726 which took more than a year to erect and cost over ¬£6,000. The people who built it were known as the ‚ÄòGrand Alliance.‚Äô They were Bowes ‚ÄòAncestor to the Queen,‚Äô Liddell and Wortleys. It was built to carry coal down to the Tyne at Dunston. It must be remembered that the locomotive had not been invented and no locomotive ever ran over it. The rails were made of wood, and the coal trucks were pulled by horses. The bridge had a span of over lOOft and is 8Oft above the stream and is about 23 ft wide. The Causey Arch is the oldest single span railway bridge in the world. In the 1930s the first thing told about the Arch was that it was built without a keystone, however, no one seems to remark on that now. There were two cottages on the Tanfield side of the Arch. The children who went to the Causey School in the 1920s and 1930s were let out of school sooner in the dark nights as the bridge was unfenced.

It is situated a few miles to the east of Bishop Auckland and a short distance to the south of Ferryhill, on the A167. The bypass on the A167 opened on 20 June 2005, cutting down the traffic through Chilton by up to 80%. Durham Road, Chilton. History Chilton was originally a mining town and called Chilton Buildings. The mine was located on the site of the current primary school, with the miners living in Windlestone Colliery, a series of terraced houses named Albert Street, Arthur Street and Prospect Terrace, locally known as The Five Rows owing to their appearance from the front. Chilton in 1092 was recorded as \\"Ciltonia\\". Chilton is derivative of the Anglo-Saxon words \\"Cild\\" (Child) and \\"Tun\\" (small town, or estate). This does not mean \\"Children's town\\" as the word \\"Child\\" in Anglo- Saxon means either young monk or young nobleman. Hence Chilton once was \\"an estate belonging to a young nobleman\\". Chilton was in the medieval ages noted as two manors, Great Chilton and Little Chilton. Chilton Hall mansion, north- east of Chilton, was once owned by the Heron family in 1351. The Hall fell into disrepair several times, before being restored on numerous occasions. It is now an impressive building on the outskirts of the village. Agriculture and farming was a major source of employment until the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s', where then people living in the village either had to work in the collieries or at the Steel Works at Spennymoor. St. Aiden's Church, at the top of Chilton, at the roundabout, was built as an iron structure in 1877, however this original church was burned to the ground in 1928 with an estimate damage cost of ¬£4000, and rebuilt with stone in 1930, thanks to the insistence of Vicar Lancelot Wilkinson. Eden Terrace, Chilton, County Durham. Local area Chilton is home to a primary school (Chilton Primary, known as Chilton Junior up until September 2002), for nursery children, to reception, Year 1; right up to Year 6. The school also participates in the Sure Start programme. After leaving Chilton Primary, many pupils go to Ferryhill Business and Enterprise College to begin with their secondary education, beginning with Year 7 through to Year 11. There are also two churches, a Catholic church (Sacred Heart) and an Anglican church (St. Aidan's), a post office, a public house, a WMC, a Catholic club which serves as a WMC as well as a polling station for the Sedgefield constituency at election times, an NHS healthcare centre, dentist, public library, and two supermarkets serving the local community. There are three take-away restaurants. A fish and chip shop, a Chinese restaurant and a pizzeria. The pizzeria is next door to the McColl's convenience store. There is also a football ground and an all-night automatically lit basketball court, as well as recreation areas with swings, slides and climbing apparatus and a skatepark. There are regular bus services to Ferryhill, Spennymoor, Durham, and other towns and cities within the county, such as Hartlepool and Darlington. The town has a thriving allotment community, serving over 200 allotments. Redevelopment and future A road bypass now carries traffic around the village, cutting out around 80% of vehicles travelling through the town itself. The bypass itself was opened in 2005, although the concept was first mooted decades before. It has been positively received by the residents and has made a huge improvement in traffic management in the area. To allow the construction of the bypass, West Chilton Terrace was cut in half, as were the allotments behind. A large amount of the social housing in Chilton and all terraces, were to be demolished (a large percentage of Dale Street has already been demolished), however as of April 2010 phase 2 of the plans have been put on hold due to shortage of local government funding. Chilton gained town status in 2000 (despite lacking common features of a town such as its neighbour, Ferryhill; including a bank, a butcher shop, or even a town hall), along with a town council and mayor. Chilton also gained a new war memorial in 2008 to commemorate men from the town who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. The names of the fallen are engraved on the marble cenotaph, and each year on Remembrance Sunday there is a ceremony in the morning, when veterans congregate to lay poppy wreaths and civilians can pay their respects to the dead of World War I. In tradition with the day, two minutes of silence are observed at 11.00, to commemorate the armistice on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, 1918. If the 11th is not a Sunday, the service is held on the second Sunday in November (nearest to the 11th). The two minutes silence is observed on both days, however. The Sunday ceremony continues to this day. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Ferryhill with a total population at the 2011 census of 8647.

History Chilton Lane was developed as a result of the growth of the railway community of Ferryhill Station and the mine of Little Chilton Colliery. The colliery of Little Chilton opened in the early 1840s. It was owned by John Evelyn Dennison, M. P. and Christopher Wilkinson. Initially housing was built to house the workforce of some 400. The coming of the Clarence and North Eastern Railway resulted in two terraces of house being built, known as Railway Rows, were built opposite the entrance to the colliery. Although the colliery had a limited life the village expanded with the sinking of Mainsforth Colliery. Chilton Lane was a commercial centre for the community, a Primitive Methodist Chapel and Sunday School was built in 1862. A school was opened in 1878, together with a mission church of Saint Lukes Church, Ferryhill. Despite being designated as a Category D village in 1950, it continues to support a vibrant community.

Work  = Basic income = In Real Freedom for All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism?Philippe Van Parijs, Real Freedom for All, What (if anything) can justify capitalism: Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995 (1995) he argues for both the justice and feasibility of a basic income for every citizen. Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a real freedom to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of income redistribution. = Linguistic justice = Another part of Van Parijs' work is about what he refers to as \\"linguistic justice\\".

It is situated a short distance to the east of Consett. Housing in the area consists of a mixture of traditional cottages and large, newer residential properties. Historically, farming and mining formed the chief sources of employment in the village. First documented in the Boldon Book as Ivestan. The village is also listed in Bishops Hatfield‚Äôs survey (1381) as Ivestane. Little is known about the prehistory of the Iveston area. In fact no certain remains from this period have been found at all. It was once thought that 'Castle Hill' might be the sight of an Iron Age hillfort. However, the remains at this site are simply those of an early-19th-century quarry. The hill itself is a spoil tip from the quarry. The only object to have been found here is a 17th-century shoe buckle. More likely to be of prehistoric date is the enclosure shown by cropmarks, which was excavated in 1963. Although no dating evidence was found, this is not surprising as many prehistoric sites produce very few finds. The Romans arrived in County Durham in the 1st century and swiftly defended their newly captured territory by building a series of forts and connecting them with a network of roads. It is thought that the course of Dere Street ran through this area connecting the forts such as Binchester with Hadrian's Wall. A number of Roman coins have also been discovered- at least one was of mid-3rd century date. It is likely that there was other Roman activity in the area which remains to be discovered. Little is known about the area between the Roman period and the medieval period, although the name Iveston is of Old English origin suggesting that there was a village here during the Anglo-Saxon period. In fact little is known about the village until the 14th century when it is recorded that a chapel dedicated to St Margaret was built by the monks of the abbey of St Mary at Blanchland. However, after the dissolution it was used for agricultural purposes and finally demolished to use the stone for a farmhouse. All that can be seen today are the remains of a roughly rectangular earth platform. Coal mining probably became important in the area as early as the 15th century; coal mines are recorded in 1440. Further mines are recorded between 1611 and 1703, but like the rest of Durham it was really the 19th century that saw the massive expansion of coal mining in the area. Iveston Colliery itself was sunk in 1839 and closed in 1892. The colliery was served by the Iveston Railway. The Roman road of Dere Street, locally following the route of the A691 from Consett and Leadgate onward to Lanchester and Durham, passes through the south of the village. However, most of the village lies on an unclassified road called Iveston Lane heading north through the village from a junction with the A691 at The New Pavilion Chinese restaurant, formerly the Iveston Inn public house. Iveston Lane passes through the village green, before descending steeply down a bank locally well known with cyclists and joggers / runners with a gradient of 15% to the north of the village. This lane then terminates at a junction with Lund's Lane and Stoneyheap Lane. A further unclassified road heads north from the A691 at the south end of Iveston across a narrow gully and connecting with the north end of Delves Lane.

It was formerly one of the three terminus railway stations in Belfast. The others were Great Victoria Street, and Queen's Quay. History =Early history= The original station buildings by Charles Lanyon York Road station was opened on 11 April 1848 by the Belfast & Ballymena Railway. Originally, it acted as terminus for rail services between Belfast and Ballymena. Later this was extended to Derry Waterside by the Londonderry and Coleraine Railway via a route to Coleraine (opened in 1855 by the Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway). A branch was also opened to Carrickfergus (1848, BBR) and Larne (1862, Carrickfergus & Larne Railway). Circa 1907 with an electric tram run by Belfast Corporation Tramways outside York Road station. The station building was initially a modest structure dating from 1848. The station roof was erected by Richard Turner, Dublin. The station was extended in 1873-1875, and again in the 1890s when the building work was under the control of Berkeley Deane Wise. The 1890s rebuilding resulted in the erection of the clock tower, concourse, tramway canopy, hotel, freight offices and goods store.The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland. William Alan McCutcheon, Northern Ireland. Department of the Environment. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1984 The company became known as the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. It was taken over by the Midland Railway in 1903, becoming the \\"Midland Railway, Northern Counties Committee\\". After the grouping of 1923, it became the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, Northern Counties Committee. Following a very brief period, from 1 January 1948, in the ownership of the British Government's British Transport Commission as the \\"Railway Executive, Northern Counties Committee\\", the Ulster Transport Authority took over the \\"NCC\\" on 1 April 1949 and, during the 1950s, set about closing much of the network. For a short time in the 1930s, some passenger services were run by the Northern Counties Committee, between York Road and Donegall Quay, where LMS steamers operated to Heysham. However, navigation through the Harbour Commissioner's lines in the docks was difficult. Trains had to proceed from the yard in Whitla Street, along Prince's Dock Street, then across the Clarendon Dock via a swing bridge, then along both Albert and Donegall Quays. Coaches had to be specially adapted for this purpose. Wooden steps were provided to allow passengers to climb into the carriages from the paved area outside Donegall Quay's transit sheds. Additionally, some rolling stock of limited height and length could proceed further past Donegall Quay and through a tunnel under the western end of the Queen's Bridge, known as the Queen's Bridge subway to Queen's Bridge goods station (now Oxford Street bus station). Until June 1963, this was the only available (if impractical) way of transferring rail vehicles through the city from York Road. This tunnel was closed in 1966 and converted into a pedestrian subway, thus completely isolating York Road from the rest of Belfast. The tunnel itself stayed open as a pedestrian subway until 2002, when it was demolished and its remnants used to carry cables. =Post-war history= Interior view in 1975 The station and adjacent works were very badly damaged in an air raid, in April 1941. The Midland Hotel, on the Whitla Street side of the complex, was destroyed, along with the covered tram terminus next door. The two large over-all semi-circular glass roofs which covered the platforms of York Road station at the concourse end were also destroyed. The damage was so severe that, in 1944, town planners proposed, in the first area plan for Belfast, that the entire station should be moved several blocks to the south, but this proposal was never implemented. Although the hotel was re-built (in much simplified form) and the station was revamped on two occasions (notably in 1966), it never regained its pre-war grandeur. A terrorist attack, in the early days of the Troubles, damaged it further. In 1968, the successor of the Ulster Transport Authority, Northern Ireland Railways drew up ambitious plans for a brand new station and office block at York Road, in a style similar to that employed for London's Euston station, which was remodelled between 1963 and 1968. These plans, copies of which were uncovered in 1999 by the Irish Railway Record Society, were soon shelved. Instead, what remained of the old station was demolished and a small, brown- brick structure built. This was opened in 1975, with the main entrance in York Road itself, at what had been the side of the old station. Parts of the site were sold at that time, and commercial premises constructed. =Modern history= York Road station in 1983 Services to Derry/Londonderry and intermediate locations continued to run until 1978, when the Belfast terminus was transferred to Belfast Central station, which had opened two years previously. Services on the Belfast‚ÄìDerry railway line were then run through a new spur that accessed the former Antrim branch of the GNRI via Lisburn station, rendering the York Road-Antrim branch redundant. With no direct rail link to the rest of the network in Belfast, York Road was relegated to being a fairly quiet terminus for services on the Belfast‚ÄìLarne railway line between 1978 and 1992, apart from some brief excursion trains, and a short resumption of York Road-Antrim stopping services in 1980. The station was finally closed in 1992 in preparation for the construction of the Cross Harbour Rail Link connecting the Belfast‚ÄìLarne railway line to . It was replaced by the nearby station which served as a temporary terminus for the Larne line until completion of the rail link over the Dargan Bridge when through services began to operate to Belfast Central. No traces of the station remain today, apart from the nearby maintenance depot, which is still in use.

Retrieved 26 November 2012Lisa Sheridan profile at the Alan Cash website, accessed 30 November 2012 Her father was born in Osaka, Japan, to a Jewish father of Russian descent. Her mother was born in Kew, Surrey, to parents of German descent. Her parents were photographers commissioned as \\"Studio Lisa\\" by the Queen Mother and her daughter, Elizabeth II to photograph the royal family and such events as royal pantomimes. She was educated at Sherrards School in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire and the Italia Conti Stage School. In 1932, at the age of 11, she debuted professionally in Where the Rainbow Ends at the Holborn Empire. She changed her name to Dinah Sheridan, which she selected from a phone book, to play Wendy, at the age of 14, in a long-running theatrical production of Peter Pan starring Jean Forbes- Robertson. Dinah became the first actress to play both Peter Pan and Wendy, touring between 1934‚Äì36 and taking the show to Stratford-upon-Avon. Her parents changed their surname to Sheridan at the same time. Her first feature film was Give My Heart (1935). Other early films included Father Steps Out (1937) and her first starring role the following year in Irish and Proud of It. Stage appearances included Terence Rattigan's French Without Tears (1939, Oxford), J B Priestley's When We Are Married (1940, with Cyril Cusack, Llandudno) and The Golden Grain (1952, with Betty Balfour, Embassy Theatre, London). One of television's pioneers Sheridan was one of the first actresses to appear on television in 1936 when the medium was in its infancy, and was interviewed on the BBC TV magazine programme Picture Page. The BBC had commenced the world's first regular-scheduled service that year from Alexandra Palace. Dinah's acting credits included appearing with Robert Helpmann in The Maker of Dreams (1937); and in Gallows Glorious, the first-ever three-act play on television (1938). Films She postponed her film career to serve for two years as an ambulance driver at the start of World War II at Welwyn Garden City, where she participated in repertory theatre. After marrying Jimmy Hanley in 1942, she appeared in several films with him. Notable films in the 1940s were Salute John Citizen (1942), Get Cracking (1943, with George Formby), Murder in Reverse (1945, with Chili Bouchier), For You Alone (1945), and the lead roles in The Hills of Donegal (1948) and The Story of Shirley Yorke (1949). She played Jane Huggett in The Huggetts Abroad (1949) and appeared as \\"Steve Temple\\" in two Paul Temple films, Calling Paul Temple (1948) and Paul Temple's Triumph (1950). She received wider recognition for her acting in 1951 as the game warden's wife in a film about African wildlife, Where No Vultures Fly. The film was notable for being largely shot on location in Africa. Although a fictional story, it was inspired by the events and life of Mervyn Cowie who had recently fought to establish the National Parks of Kenya. Given a Royal Premiere, it became one of the UK box office hits of the year and won the National Board of Review award (USA) for Foreign Film of the Year. Dinah followed this with playing the second female lead in the acclaimed The Sound Barrier (1952) directed by David Lean. The film was a popular and critical success, winning many awards including three BAFTAs, an Academy Award, a New York Critics Circle award and four National Board of Review awards. In interviews, Dinah spoke of how she was very happy to take a supporting role to Ann Todd in order to be directed by Lean. Sheridan then starred opposite Dirk Bogarde in Appointment in London (1952) and had a featured role as Grace Marston in The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan which was made as part of the Coronation celebrations of 1953. She was Britain's top female box-office star of 1953, according to the Motion Picture Herald's poll of film exhibitors. This issued a ranking of the 'Top Ten British Box-Office Stars' each year. One of her enduringly popular roles was as Wendy McKim in the comedy Genevieve (1953), where her \\"comic instinct and control were precise and stylish\\". The film won a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and a National Board of Review award. Her other most memorable screen role was as Mrs Waterbury, the mother of the Railway Children in the famous film The Railway Children (1970). She made only one more cinema film after The Railway Children: The Mirror Crack'd (1980), which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson, with Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple. That role was an atmospheric cameo appearance with Anthony Steel and Nigel Stock in the 'film within a film' Murder at Midnight. Return to the stage Dinah Sheridan's second husband, film executive John Davis, whom she married in 1954, insisted that she quit acting and stay at home with her children. After their 1965 divorce (which was granted to Sheridan on the grounds of cruelty), she resumed her career appearing in Margaret Williams' comedy Let's All Go Down the Strand (1967, alongside Gladys Cooper and Evelyn Laye, Phoenix Theatre, London). Let's All Go Down the Strand began a prolonged period of success in London's West End, with Sheridan appearing in both comedic and dramatic roles for the next 25 years. She starred in Ronald Gow's A Boston Story (1968, opposite Tony Britton, Duchess Theatre); Ira Wallach's Out of the Question (1969, again opposite Dame Gladys Cooper, St Martin's Theatre), and in the title role of Ray Cooney's Move Over Mrs Markham (1972, again opposite Tony Britton, Vaudeville Theatre). She played the Countess of Chell in Waterhouse & Hall's The Card (1973, with Jim Dale, Queen's Theatre), and starred in Frances Durbridge's The Gentle Hook (1973, Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, then Piccadilly Theatre), Samuel Taylor & Cornelia Otis Skinner's The Pleasure of His Company (1976 revival, starring opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Phoenix Theatre), Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced (1977, opposite Dulcie Gray, Vaudeville Theatre), William Douglas Home's In The Red (1977, with Gerald Harper, Whitehall Theatre) and No√´l Coward's Present Laughter (1981, with Donald Sinden and Gwen Watford, Vaudeville Theatre). The latter production was recorded and transmitted on BBC Television. During 1978/79, Dinah starred opposite John Gielgud in Half Life which toured the UK, before they both took the play to Toronto, Canada. Other theatre credits included Robert's Wife (1968, with future husband John Merivale at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre), Softly, Goldfish Mating (1971, with Patrick Macnee, toured the UK), Touch of Purple (1972, Thorndike Theatre, Leatherhead), Don Taylor's Out On The Lawn (1975, with Edward Hardwicke, Rosemary Leach and T. P. McKenna, Watford Palace Theatre), No√´l Coward's Star Quality (1982/83, with Emlyn Williams and Annette Crosbie amongst others, Theatre Royal Bath), George Bernard Shaw's The Apple Cart (1985/86, with Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, firstly in Bath, then transferred to the London's Theatre Royal Haymarket), and William Douglas Home's The Kingfisher (1992, Theatre Royal Bath and toured the UK). Dinah participated in A Talent To Amuse a gala evening production at the Phoenix Theatre, London, on 16 December 1969 which celebrated No√´l Coward's 70th birthday. Sheridan and John Merivale were friends of Coward. Many stars appeared in the production, including John Gielgud, Anna Neagle, Richard Attenborough, Joyce Grenfell and Danny La Rue. Television Having made television history by appearing in the first major TV play and being the first actor interviewee in the 1930s, Dinah worked extensively in the medium later in her career. Roles included guest appearances in popular series of the time including Armchair Theatre (1969), Seasons of the Year (1971), Zodiac, Crown Court and Marked Personal (all during 1974), Village Hall (1975); Sykes (1979) and The Swish of the Curtain (1980). Sheridan featured in several major television plays (in the BBC Play of the Month and Play for Today strands) most notably Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (1969, with Margaret Leighton, Keith Michell, Jeremy Brett and Susan Hampshire); and John Galsworthy's Loyalties (1976, with Edward Fox amongst others). Both were produced by Cedric Messina and directed by Rudolph Cartier. In 1983 she made a guest appearance in the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who as the Time Lady Chancellor Flavia in the 20th-anniversary special, \\"The Five Doctors\\". She co-starred with long-standing friend and colleague Tony Britton and Nigel Havers in British sitcom, Don't Wait Up (1983‚Äì90, BBC TV) which had audiences of over 15 million. She was a regular in the ITV series The Winning Streak (1985) and Just Us (1992), and the BBC comedy series All Night Long (1994). She made a memorable guest appearance as Dotty Mayhew in BBC TV's Lovejoy special The Prague Sun (1992), which also featured Donald Pleasence and Peter Vaughan. Her last role was in 1999 as Kathleen Gilmore in the Jonathan Creek television episode \\"Miracle in Crooked Lane\\". When Sheridan was the subject of the UK TV show This Is Your Life in 1979, guests in the studio included John Gielgud, Evelyn Laye, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Betty Marsden and Charles Hawtrey, and filmed tributes from Dirk Bogarde and Tony Britton. Sheridan died peacefully at her home in Northwood, London, on 25 November 2012, aged 92. She is buried in Northwood Cemetery. Private life Sheridan married four times: first to actor Jimmy Hanley (1942‚Äì1952), with whom she had three children, then to business executive John Davis (1954‚Äì1965), then to actor John Merivale (1986‚Äì1990, his death) and, finally, to Aubrey Ison (1992‚Äì2007, his death). During her marriage to Aubrey Ison, the couple lived in Palm Desert, California; following Aubrey's death, Dinah returned to the UK in 2007. Her son Jeremy Hanley became an accountant, Conservative Party Chairman and government minister under John Major's administration. Her daughter Jenny Hanley became an actress and a co-presenter of the British television series Magpie. Another daughter died in infancy. Throughout her life she remained close friends and correspondent with several former co-stars, particularly Dame Gladys Cooper, Sir John Gielgud, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Sir Dirk Bogarde. Cooper was the stepmother of actor John (Jack) Merivale, Dinah's long-time partner (1968‚Äì86) and later husband (1986‚Äì90, his death). For many years John Merivale required kidney dialysis which Dinah learnt to perform at home.

Oak, was a Hindutva historical revisionist from India. Among his prominent claims were that Christianity and Islam are both derivatives of Hinduism; that Vatican City, Kaaba, Westminster Abbey and the Taj Mahal were once Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva; and that the Papacy was originally a Vedic Priesthood. Their reception in Indian popular culture have been noted by observers of contemporary Indian society. He ran an 'Institute for Rewriting Indian History' in the 1980s which published a quarterly periodical called Itihas Patrika dedicated to fringe causes; he had also written numerous books, some of which have even lead to court cases in a bid to alter the mainstream history narrative. Life Oak was born in 1917 in Indore in the erstwhile Princely State of Indore, British India. According to his own account, he completed an M.A. (Agra) and a law degree (LL.B. Mumbai), before being inducted as a Class I Gazetted officer in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting wherein he wrote various journalistic pieces. Before joining the army, he also claims to have worked as an English tutor at Fergusson College in Pune. In 1964, he founded an organisation called Institute for Rewriting Indian History. He died on 4 December 2007, at 3.30 am at his Pune residence aged 90. Historical revisionism =Taj Mahal Theory= In 2000 India's Supreme Court dismissed Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king had built the Taj Mahal by saying he had a \\"bee in his bonnet\\" about the Taj. Till date, as of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by Oak's theory.Siraj Qureshi, \\"Another court petition challenges Taj Mahal's story as a symbol of love\\", India Today, 12 August 2017.\\"Is Taj Mahal a mausoleum or a Shiva temple? CIC asks govt to clarify\\", Hindustan Times, 10 August 2017. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.BJP's Vinay Katiyar now calls Taj Mahal a Hindu temple - a 'bee in bonnet' theory that Supreme Court once rejected India Today Giles Tillotson calls Oak's claims as a \\"desperate bid to assign a new meaning to the Taj\\" and \\"pseudo-scholarship\\". He states that Oak interprets the statements of Padshahnama about Shah Jahan's purchase of the land for the Taj from Jai Singh I upon where a mansion built by an ancestor of the Raja earlier existed, to claim that Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism. Tillotson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in 4th-century India, Oak's original claim, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from the 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings. In relation to similarity with buildings of West Asia, Oak also claims them all to be \\"products of Hindu architecture\\". =Kaaba Theory: Vedic origins= In a 13-page pamphlet titled Was Kaaba a Hindu Temple?, Oak derives a claim of a \\"Vedic past of Arabia\\" based on an inscription mentioning the legendary Indian king VikramƒÅditya that Oak claims was found inside a dish inside the Kaaba. According to Oak, the text of the alleged inscription is taken from the page 315 of an anthology of poetry entitled Sayar-ul-Okul (Se'-arul Oqul meaning the memorable words),Muslim Digest, July to Oct. 1986 pages 23‚Äì24; Purushottam Nagesh Oak, Indian Kshatriyas Once Ruled from Bali to Baltic & Korea to Kaba (1966) compiled in 1742 on the orders of a \\"Sultan Salim\\" (the actual Sultan at the time being Mahmud I, sultan Selim III lived from 1761 to 1808) from the earlier work of prophet Muhammed's uncle Amr ibn HishƒÅm (poetic name \\"Abu al- ·∏§akam\\" (or ÿßÿ®ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ) or meaning the \\"Father of wisdom\\") who had refused to convert to Islam, and, first modern version published in 1864 in Berlin and a subsequent edition was published in Beirut in 1932.\\"Hindu Vishva\\", Volume 27, Issues 4-11, pp. 16. Oak goes on to state that the anthology is kept in the \\"Makhtab-e-Sultania Library\\" (Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultanisi or Galatasaray Imperial School) in Istanbul, Turkey which has been now renamed as Galatasaray Lisesi school.Rabbi Simon Altaf, 2011, World War III - Unmasking the End-Times Beast: Unmasking End Time Beast, African-Israel International Union of Israelite Qahalim, .  Reception  Srinivas Aravamudan notes Oak to be a 'mythistorian' whose work resorted to exploiting comparative philology in the generation of delusional etymologies‚Äîassociating Sanskrit sound-alikes with foreign terms such as Vatican=vatika (hermitage), Christianity=Krishna-niti (the way of Krishna), Abraham as an aberration of Brahma -- to purvey an Islamophobic and anti-Christian agenda under the covers of Hindutva. Edwin Bryant in his work on Indo-Aryan theory describes Oak to be a self-styled historian whose works suffer from an ubiquitous and very poor standard of professionalism and critical methodology and who fit the definition of a crack-pot. Giles Tillotson describes Oak's work on Taj Mahal as a \\"startling piece of pseudo-scholarship\\", which was plainly a work of polemical fantasy intended to denigrate Islam and did not merit any serious scholarly attention. Art historian Rebecca Brown described Oak's books as \\"revisionist history as subtle as Captain Russell's smirk\\" (referring to a character in the Hindi movie Lagaan). Oak's theories have been noted to have found a popular following among right-wing Hindu factions in a bid to wage politico-religious battles. Tapan Raychaudhuri has referred to him as \\"a 'historian' much respected by the Sangh Parivar.\\" Incidentally, one of his books \\"Some Blunders in Indian Historical Research\\" was banned from the Parliament's library by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or MPADS) are portable surface-to-air missiles. They are guided weapons and are a threat to low-flying aircraft, especially helicopters. Overview MANPADS were developed in the 1950s to provide military ground forces with protection from jet aircraft. They have received a great deal of attention, partly because armed groups have used them against commercial airliners. These missiles, affordable and widely available through a variety of sources, have been used successfully over the past three decades both in military conflicts, as well as by terrorist organizations.Footnote 1 in original source (CRS RL31741): \\"Shoulder-fired SAMs have been used effectively in a variety of conflicts ranging from the Arab-Israeli Wars, Vietnam, the Iran-Iraq War, to the Falklands Conflict, as well as conflicts in Nicaragua, Yemen, Angola, and Uganda, the Chad-Libya Conflict, and the Balkans Conflict in the 1990s. Some analysts claim that Afghan mujahedin downed 269 Soviet aircraft using 340 shoulder-fired SAMs during the Soviet-Afghan War and that 12 of 29 Allied aircraft shot down during the 1991 Gulf War were downed by MANPADS.\\" Twenty- five countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and Russia and Turkey produce man-portable air defense systems.CRS RL31741 page 1Wade Bose, \\"Wassenaar Agreement Agrees on MANPADS Export Criteria\\", Arms Control Today, January/February 2001, p. 1., quoted in CRS RL31741 Possession, export, and trafficking of such weapons is officially tightly controlled, due to the threat they pose to civil aviation, although such efforts have not always been successful. The missiles are about in length and weigh about , depending on the model. MANPADS generally have a target detection range of about and an engagement range of about , so aircraft flying at or higher are relatively safe.Marvin B. Schaffer, \\"Concerns About Terrorists With Manportable SAMS\\", RAND Corporation Reports, October 1993, quoted in CRS RL31741 The acronym MANPADS is commonly mistaken to have a singular form of \\"MANPAD\\"‚Äîthis is incorrect, as even a singular unit is still a system and would have the final S in the acronym. Missile types FIM-43C Redeye missile just after launch, before the sustainer motor ignites SA-18 (Igla) missile with launch tube and gripstock (top) and an SA-16 (Igla-1) missile and launch tube (bottom) Type 91 Kai MANPADS at a mock airborne target in the Pacific Alaskan Range Complex as part of Red Flag ‚Äì Alaska. A Starstreak SAM fired from a M1097 AN/TWQ-1 Avenger Air Defense platform. =Infrared= Infrared homing missiles are designed to home-in on a heat source on an aircraft, typically the engine exhaust plume, and detonate a warhead in or near the heat source to disable the aircraft. These missiles use passive guidance, meaning that they do not emit signals to detect a heat source, which makes them difficult to detect by targeted aircraft employing countermeasure systems.CRS RL31741 page 1-2 First generation The first missiles deployed in the 1960s were infrared missiles. First generation MANPADS, such as the US Redeye, early versions of the Soviet 9K32 Strela-2, and the Chinese HN-5 (copy of Soviet Strela-2), are considered \\"tail-chase weapons\\" as their uncooled spin-scan seekers can only discern the superheated interior of the target's jet engine from background noise. This means they were only capable accurately tracking the aircraft from the rear, when the engines are fully exposed to the missile's seeker and provide a sufficient thermal signature for engagement. First generation IR missiles are also highly susceptible to interfering thermal signatures from background sources, including the sun, which many experts feel makes them somewhat unreliable, and they are prone to erratic behaviour in the terminal phase of engagement.CRS RL31741 page 2 While less effective than more modern weapons, they remain common in irregular forces as they are not limited by the short shelf-life of gas coolant cartridges used by later systems. Second generation Second generation infrared missiles, such as early versions of the U.S. Stinger, the Soviet Strela-3, and the Chinese FN-6, use gas-cooled seeker heads and a conical scanning technique, which enables the seeker to filter out most interfering background IR sources as well as permitting head-on and side engagement profiles. Later versions of the Redeye MANPADS are regarded as straddling the first and second generations as they are gas-cooled but still use a spin-scan seeker. Third generation Third generation infrared MANPADS, such as the French Mistral, the Soviet 9K38 Igla, and the US Stinger B, use rosette scanning detectors to produce a quasi-image of the target. Their seeker compares input from multiple detections bands, either two widely separated IR bands or IR and UV, giving them much greater ability to discern and reject countermeasures deployed by the target aircraft. Fourth generation Fourth generation missiles, such as the cancelled American FIM-92 Stinger Block 2, Russian SA-25, Chinese QW-4, and Japanese Type 91 surface-to-air missile use imaging infrared focal plane array guidance systems and other advanced sensor systems, which permit engagement at greater ranges.\\"Raytheon Electronic Systems FIM-92 Stinger Low-Altitude Surface-to-Air Missile System Family\\", Jane's Defence, October 13, 2000, quoted in CRS RL31741 =Command line-of-sight= Command guidance (CLOS) missiles do not home in on a particular aspect (heat source or radio or radar transmissions) of the targeted aircraft. Instead, the missile operator or gunner visually acquires the target using a magnified optical sight and then uses radio controls to \\"fly\\" the missile into the aircraft. One of the benefits of such a missile is that it is virtually immune to flares and other basic countermeasure systems that are designed primarily to defeat IR missiles. The major drawback of CLOS missiles is that they require highly trained and skilled operators. Numerous reports from the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in the 1980s cite Afghan mujahedin as being disappointed with the British-supplied Blowpipe CLOS missile because it was too difficult to learn to use and highly inaccurate, particularly when employed against fast moving jet aircraft.Timothy Gusinov, \\"Portable Weapons May Become the Next Weapon of Choice for Terrorists\\", Washington Diplomat, January 2003, p. 2., quoted in CRS RL31741 Given these considerations, many experts believe that CLOS missiles are not as ideally suited for untrained personnel use as are IR missiles, which sometimes are referred to as \\"fire and forget\\" missiles.CRS RL31741 page 2-3 Later versions of CLOS missiles, such as the British Javelin, use a solid state television camera in lieu of the optical tracker to make the gunner's task easier. The Javelin's manufacturer, Thales Air Defence, claims that their missile is virtually impervious to countermeasures.\\"Land-Based Air Defence 2003-2004\\", Jane's, 2003, p. 37., quoted in CRS RL31741 =Laser guided= Laser guided MANPADS use beam-riding guidance where a sensor in the missile's tail detects the emissions from a laser on the launcher and attempts to steer the missile to fly at the exact middle of the beam, or between two beams. Missiles such as Sweden's RBS-70 and Britain's Starstreak can engage aircraft from all angles and only require the operator to continuously track the target using a joystick to keep the laser aim point on the target: the latest version of RBS 70 features a tracking engagement mode where fine aim adjustments of the laser emitter are handled by the launcher itself, with the user only having to make coarse aim corrections. Because there are no radio data links from the ground to the missile, the missile cannot be effectively jammed after it is launched. Even though beam- riding missiles require relatively extensive training and skill to operate, many experts consider these missiles particularly menacing due to the missiles' resistance to most conventional countermeasures in use today.CRS RL31741 page 3Richardson, Mark, and Al-Jaberi, Mubarak, \\"The vulnerability of laser warning systems against guided weapons based on low power lasers\\", Cranfield University, April 28, 2006 Notable uses = Against military aircraft = * List of Soviet aircraft losses in Afghanistan * Argentine air forces in the Falklands War * British air services in the Falklands War. * On 27 February 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, an USAF F-16 was shot down by an Igla-1.

Understanding the problem in 2003, Colin Powell remarked that there was \\"no threat more serious to aviation\\" than the missiles,. which can be used to shoot down helicopters and commercial airliners, and are sold illegally for as little as a few hundred dollars. The U.S. has led a global effort to dismantle these weapons, with over 30,000 voluntarily destroyed since 2003, but probably thousands are still in the hands of insurgents, especially in Iraq, where they were looted from the military arsenals of the former dictator Saddam Hussein, and in Afghanistan as well.

For many years his pipe smoking, contemplative figure was synonymous with German parapsychology. He was an investigator of 'unusual human experience', e.g. poltergeists and clairvoyants. One of his most famous cases was the Rosenheim Poltergeist.  Life  After his secondary school examination in 1925, he studied law in Lausanne and Paris. In 1927, he started to study psychology, philosophy, and Romance studies in Freiburg, Heidelberg, and Berlin. From 1929 on, he studied in Bonn by Professor Erich Rothacker psychology and by professor Ernst Robert Curtius Romance studies. He took the doctors degree 1933 by Rothacker with the dissertation Psychische Automatismen. At the time he was an assistant at the Psychological Institute of the University of Bonn, he studied medicine in parallel to the controversial psychology to get a better reputation. His claim to have made his a state examination for a PhD in medicine by professor Kurt Beringer on the subject of \\"Die Arbeitskurve unter Pervitin\\" remained a claim, as he was not able to present the promotion certificate. To eliminate this problem, he drew up a new medical dissertation at old age. In 1939, he worked as a volunteer at the Psychiatric and Intern Clinic in Freiburg. As he was unfit for the military service, he could act in place of his drafted professor Rothacker in 1940 in Bonn. From September of this year on, he also worked at the Internal Clinic in Bonn. In June, he married Henriette Wiechert, who was \\"starring\\" as the experimental subject with the nicknames \\"Miss Dora D.\\" or \\"Miss D.\\" in his dissertation. In order to have a successful career, Bender had already joined the NSDAP at that time. To be able to call himself an associate professor at the newly founded Reichsuniversit√§t Stra√üburg, he was habilitated in 1941 with the treatise on the subject \\"Experimentelle Visionen. Ein Beitrag zum Problem der Sinnest√§uschung, des Realit√§tsbewusstseins und der Schichten der Pers√∂nlichkeit\\". With the intervention of the historian Ernst Anrich, he became from the Reichsministerium for Sciences, Education and public instruction the necessary lectureship. From 1942 to 1944, he taught psychology and clinical psychology, also managing the Paracelsus Institute, where Bender originally planned to make research on the subject of astrology. At the request of his patron Friedrich Spieser, he studied the subject of dowsing. After his detention in a British camp between November 1944 and July 1945, he returned to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he was got a lectureship for psychology. In 1950, he founded the non-university Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health. From 1946 to 1949, he acted for the Chair for Psychology and Pedagogy and was a Di√§tendozent afterwards. After he made guest professorships in 1951 and 1954, he was appointed as an extraordinary professor for frontier areas of psychology. In 1967, he became a full professor for psychology and frontier areas of psychology. One quarter of subjects were issues of parapsychology. In 1975, he became professor emeritus. When journalists of the SPIEGEL magazine found out in 1977 that no copy of his medical dissertation could be found, and that Bender also could not produce a promotion certificate, the district attorney brought a procedure because of assuming a false title. To avoid prosecution, Bender promoted again by Manfred M√ºller-K√ºppers, with whom he had co-operated in cases of haunting.  Research and activities  Bender had been skilled in depth psychology and oriented himself mostly by approaches of Pierre Janet and Carl Gustav Jung. From this, it follows that on the one hand, he used mostly a qualitative approach instead of a quantitative one. On the other hand, he held an \\"animistic\\" approach in parapsychology instead of a \\"spiritualistic\\" one. In parapsychology this means that paranormal phenomena were not treated as influences of spirits, but as a result of the great strain of the \\"focus person\\". Because of this approach concerning parapsychological phenomena, he associated the experiments of a sensitive approach with the analysis of an affective approach to parapsychology and neurotic faulty attitudes. An important result of his studies is the principle of Gleichf√∂rmigkeit des Okkulten (similarity or omnipresence of the Occult). He assumed that the omnipresence of such phenomena and experiences in different eras, cultures, regions and strata of society renders them worthwhile studying.Hans Bender: Zukunftsvisionen, Kriegsprophezeiungen, Sterbeerlebnisse. 2. Aufl. Piper Verlag, M√ºnchen 1986, (Aufs√§tze zur Parapsychologie; 2). Another feature of his work was his close contact with astrologers, such as Thomas Ring, a friend of his. He was consulting him in astrology both in private and scientific matters. Beside this, he was convinced that his wife had a telepathic connection to him. Seeing in case of doubt in apparently unexplainable experiences something paranormal brought him into criticism. This was not only because of his specialty or his close relation to the mass media, but also his assistants occasional observance that he was not always making thorough research. As an example, he explained in 1982 the haunting case \\"Chopper\\" that was proven to be a manipulation of a dental nurse in Neutraubling near to Regensburg headily as authentic to the magazine Die Aktuelle. His critics alleged him already before this of overseeing manipulation attempts by his focus persons. For instance, the criminal marshal of Herbert Sch√§fer of the Land Office of Criminal Investigation in Bremen effected a confession of the focus person. Bender had seen the haunting issue \\"Heinrich Scholz\\" as authentic in 1965. The focus person, who was a trainee in a china store back then did not only manipulated deliberately in the store, but also during the screening in his laboratory. Bender's assistants countered with expertise that at least some of the manipulations should not have occurred. The problem of manipulations also exists in the most known haunting case of Bender, \\"the haunting of Rosenheim\\", that occurred in an attorney's chancellery between 1967 and 1968. This case was not only documented by Bender and his assistants, but by technicians of the Post Office and the power plant, by the police and physicists of the Max Planck Institute in Munich. Notwithstanding the fact that the physicists wrote in their expert opinion that not all the phenomena observed could be explained with the laws of physics, at least in one case, a manipulation of the focus person, a clerk, could be detected.Herbert Sch√§fer: Poltergeister und Professoren. √úber den Zustand der Parapsychologie, 1994 Bender and his assistants explained the case such that the often psychologically labile focus persons manipulate in order to have the focus of attention, when the real parapsychological phenomena fail to appear. Critical reception Dutch journalist and skeptic Piet Hein Hoebens has criticized Bender's investigation claims of the Rosenheim Poltergeist, saying that \\"No full report of the investigations has ever been published, so we are in no position to check to what extent the parapsychologists have been successful in excluding naturalistic explanations.\\" Hoebens wrote that Bender's accounts of his investigation show that he may not have made a rigorous enough examination of the evidence, which Hoebens deems highly questionable.Hoebens, Piet Hein. (1986). Sense and Nonsense in Parapsychology. In Kendrick Frazier. (1986). Science Confronts the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 28-42. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell described Bender as a paranormal believer unwilling \\"to draw the obvious conclusion from the evidence.\\" Nickell noted that Bender considered a poltergeist case to have genuine effects even though the subject was discovered to have cheated. According to Nickell \\"this approach contrasts with that of skeptical investigators who consider one instance of deceit to discredit an entire case\\".Nickell, Joe. (1993).

The main village of Ouston (formerly called Ulkerton in earlier medieval times) is adjoined by the 1970s built housing estate known as Urpeth Grange but both are referred to colloquially as Ouston by locals. The population of the parish taken at the 2011 census was 2821. Governance Ouston is a major part of the electoral ward named Ouston and Urpeth. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 7,490. Schools There were three schools in Ouston: St. Benet's Roman Catholic Infant & Junior School which has celebrated their 40th anniversary of the school, Ouston Infant and Ouston Junior school. Ouston Junior School was opened in December, 1964. In 2014 the Infant and Junior schools were amalgamated on the site of the Junior School to form Ouston Primary. This School also provides a venue for several community activities and is often the venue for local cross country events. Amenities There are two pubs: the Red Lion in Ouston and The Cherry Tree in Urpeth Grange. A Working men's club (The Ranch) is also situated in the neighbouring village of Perkinsville. Shops are limited to a Post Office located in the petrol station, a hairdressers and a couple of general stores. Organisations based in the village include the Ouston and Urpeth Conservation Volunteers and the Ouston Villagers Association Transport There are regular bus routes through Ouston with the Go North East bus company. The 34 and 34A run from Ouston to Chester-le-Street and the 28 and 28A buses run from Chester-le- Street through Ouston and into Newcastle upon Tyne via Gateshead. Locality The village itself was mostly constructed in 1961 with the showhomes being in Ardrossan opposite the Junior School which opened in 1964. Over time the village expanded to its current size with further expansion continuing from Penhill, Urpeth, in the early 1970s onwards. In recent years the housing development has rebegun in earnest in Turnberry and Woodlands, the former being a disused farmer's field with some World War II bunkers in it and the latter being an area next to the council estate (The Brooms) in an area near Walter's Wood. Ouston is a quiet village with only one main road through it, which even at busy times of the day is still quiet. The village is surrounded by countryside, farm life and stunning views of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The stories in the anthologies serve to introduce characters, provide deeper more complete backstory and flesh out the universe, so claim the same canonical relevance as exposition in the main series. David Weber, author of the mainline Honor Harrington series, serves as editor for the anthologies, maintaining fidelity to the series canons. The book contains the following stories: ; The Stray by Linda Evans : Set shortly after A Beautiful Friendship, this is an early story of human interaction with treecats. ; What Price Dreams? by David Weber : Another story about human-treecat interaction, exploring the background to the treecats' extraordinary status in Manticoran society. ; Queen's Gambit by Jane Lindskold : Roger III, King of Manticore, dies in what appears to be an accident. His daughter Elizabeth rises to the throne, and suspects that the death of her father may not have been an accident at all. Meanwhile, a cabal of Manticoran politicians make their moves in an attempt to influence Elizabeth's regency. As all sides make their moves, the new Queen Elizabeth learns a hard lesson about politics and compromise in the process. ; The Hard Way Home by David Weber : Lieutenant Commander Honor Harrington, executive officer of the cruiser HMS Broadsword, is participating in a series of evaluation exercises of a new type of pinnace when an avalanche strikes a holiday resort on the planet Gryphon, killing hundreds and burying many others under meters of snow. Honor must take command of the rescue operations and save as many people as she and the men and women of Broadsword can. ; Deck Load Strike by Roland J.

Next day, i.e. Monday, which is the day of 'Karikkali' [cultural folk dance performed to please the Lord Shiva & Shakti], the Koti-Koora for Vela is hoisted up the temple KodiMaram. 'Chamannju Kali' in continuation of 'Karikkali' is solemnized next day (Tuesday)in the premise of Temple. Next day - Wednesday - Kummaatti is played by the Desam who gathered below the Raavandath-Aalthara-Mannam. Customarily; these Karikkali, Chamannjukali and Kummatti are performed by the male-members of Nair Samudaayam and Mannadiar samudayam. This is an age-old conventional practice regarded by one and all in the Village. The lyrics of songs sung while playing Karikkali & Chamannjuakali (generally known as MalamakKali or KanyaarKali) were written by some great scholars from among our highly intellect ancestors. From the unique terminology used in these lyrics, it transpires that this would have been written sometime around AD 900+. The songs mainly are in adoration to Lord Shiva, Goddess Devi, Subramanyar, Sun, Moon, Nature, and so forth. Of course, many of its lines have innate essence of Vedic as well as philosophical doctrines, too. Extracting the exact interpretation out of these most significant lyrics is somewhat a tough task for the present generation. Still..., the devotional performance arts - dance form - is followed intact by the generations with due dedication. After Kummaatti, Thursday to Saturday, another temple-art-form, widely known as Tholppaava Kooth, (Puppet-Shadow- Play)is executed by the expert Pulavar inside the KoothumaaDdam beside Maangottukaavu. Wherein, whole story of the Holy Raamaayanam is narrated and played in a distinct fashion using these Puppets to portray different character(s) of the epic. And, on Sunday, the VELA is celebrated with variety of colorful programs such as, Vaadyam, Elephant procession, Poothan-Thira, Pon-kuthira, Thaalappoli, etc. etc. This comes to an end by Monday morning with a great episode of fireworks. The villagers relax for another 3‚Äì4 days. On the ensuing Friday & Saturdays (during night hours) Kanyaar-Kali takes places in front of Sree Kurumbha Kaavu, beneath a well-decorated marquee illuminated with Deepams. And finally on Sunday, the KodikKoora that hoisted on the day of Karikkalli, would be pulled down duly observing all systematic observances. As soon as the Koti-koora is pulled down, distribution of the Desa-Paayasam goes on among the villagers and visitors, above the Aalthara in the close vicinity of Sree Mangottu Kaavu. That night also, KanyaarKali is played by the Mannadiar men in front of Moola-Sthaanam from where the Vela procession begins every year. Apart from above, except monsoon, all through the year, series of several edifying programs and social activities are held in this green village. All those who respect our traditions and love folklore art forms as well as temple arts are cordially invited to visit this dazzlingly magnificent village - ATHIPOTTA !!!

It is an Old Iranian language and classified as belonging to the Northwestern Iranian subfamily, which includes many other languages such as Old Azeri, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Zaza‚ÄìGorani, Kurdish, and Baluchi. Attestation Median is attested only by numerous loanwords in Old Persian. Nothing is known of its grammar, \\"but it shares important phonological isoglosses with Avestan, rather than Old Persian. Under the Median rule.... Median must to some extent have been the official Iranian language in western Iran\\". No documents dating to Median times have been preserved, and it is not known what script these texts might have been in. \\"So far only one inscription of pre-Achaemenid times (a bronze plaque) has been found on the territory of Media. This is a cuneiform inscription composed in Akkadian, perhaps in the 8th century BCE, but no Median names are mentioned in it.\\" Some modern research suggests that the so- called Linear Elamite, which still has not been deciphered, may have been written in the language of Medes, by assuming Kutik-Inshushinak was the original Iranian name of Cyaxares the Great and not a much earlier Elamite king.Cyaxares: Media's Great King in Egypt, Assyria & Iran, by: Professor Gunnar Heinsohn, University of Bremen, May 2006 Identity A distinction from other ethnolinguistic groups (in Herodotus, ethnos means 'people') such as the Persians is evident primarily in foreign sources, such as from mid-9th- century BCE Assyrian cuneiform sources and from Herodotus' mid-5th-century BCE secondhand account of the Perso-Median conflict. It is not known what the native name of the Median language was (just like for all other Old Iranian languages) or whether the Medes themselves nominally distinguished it from the languages of other Iranian peoples. Median is \\"presumably\\" a substrate of Old Persian. The Median element is readily identifiable because it did not share in the developments that were particular to Old Persian. Median forms \\"are found only in personal or geographical names... and some are typically from religious vocabulary and so could in principle also be influenced by Avestan.... Sometimes, both Median and Old Persian forms are found, which gave Old Persian a somewhat confusing and inconsistent look: 'horse,' for instance, is [attested in Old Persian as] both asa (OPers.) and aspa (Med.).\\" Using comparative phonology of proper names attested in Old Persian, Roland Kent pp. 8-9. notes several other Old Persian words that appear to be borrowings from Median: for example, taxma, 'brave', as in the proper name Taxmaspada. Diakonoff includes paridaiza, 'paradise'; vazraka, 'great' and xshayathiya, 'royal'. In the mid-5th century BCE, Herodotus (Histories 1.110 (Histories 1.110)) noted that spaka is the Median word for a female dog. This term and meaning are preserved in living Iranian languages such as Talyshi. In the 1st century BCE, Strabo (c. 64BCE‚Äì24CE) would note a relationship between the various Iranian peoples and their languages: \\"[From] beyond the Indus... Ariana is extended so as to include some part of Persia, Media, and the north of Bactria and Sogdiana; for these nations speak nearly the same language.\\" (Geography, 15.2.1-15.2.8 p. 125. (Geography 15.2)) Traces of the (later) dialects of Media (not to be confused with the Median language) are preserved in the compositions of the fahlaviyat genre, verse composed in the old dialects of the Pahla/Fahla regions of Iran's northwest. Consequently, these compositions have \\"certain linguistic affinities\\" with Parthian, but the surviving specimens (which are from the 9th to 18th centuries CE) are much influenced by Persian. For an enumeration of linguistic characteristics and vocabulary \\"deserving mention,\\" see . The use of fahla (from Middle Persian pahlaw) to denote Media is attested from late Arsacid times so it reflects the pre-Sassanid use of the word to denote \\"Parthia\\", which, during Arsacid times, included most of Media. Predecessor of modern Iranian languages A number of modern Iranian languages spoken today have had medieval stages with evidences found from citations in Classical and Early Modern Persian sources. G. Windfuhr believes, \\"The modern [Iranian] languages of Azarbaijan and Central Iran, located in ancient Media Atropatene and Media proper, are 'Median' dialects\\" and those languages \\"continue lost local and regional language\\" of Old Median, which is mainly known as \\"Medisms in Old Persian.\\" The term comes from the regional name Pahlav/Fahlav (see fahlaviyat) in traditional medieval Persian sources and is used to call \\"dialect poetry and other samples of locales in western Iran reflects the Parthian period\\" of those regionsPage 15 from and their languages \\"being survivals of the Median dialects have certain linguistic affinities with Parthian\\".

The stories in the anthologies serve to introduce characters, provide deeper more complete backstory and flesh out the universe, so claim the same canonical relevance as exposition in the main series. David Weber, author of the mainline Honor Harrington series, serves as editor for the anthologies, maintaining fidelity to the series canons. Contents The book (designated HHA3) contains the following stories (by David Weber unless otherwise marked): =Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington= : (HH0), also reprinted in the Worlds of Weber collection depicting universes invented by David Weber :Midshipwoman Honor Harrington embarks on the heavy cruiser HMS War Maiden for her midshipman's cruise, the final pass-fail make- or-break shipboard training and testing that will see her accepted as an officer (ensign) or washed out as a civilian. The War Maiden, an aging heavy cruiser is on an anti-piracy and commerce protection mission which will take the ship to the chaos-ridden Silesian Confederacy. During her cruise, Honor experiences life on a Manticoran warship, learns from excellent officers and suffers under one pre-prejudiced and incompetent one, who unfortunately is the OCTO, the Officer Candidate (\\"snotty\\" or midshipman) Training Officer who is politically connected and been manipulated into giving Honor and her treecat Nimitz a particularly tough time, at the behest of Lord North Hollow. That corrupt peer is the father of Pavel Young, who had been sanctioned for attempting to rape Honor at the naval academy.Backstory in On Basilisk Station, The Short Victorious War, and Field of Dishonor and other HH works. :Her budding professionalism and poise wins her friends and engenders appreciation in the crew and stands in stark contrast to the behavior of her OCTO, Lt. Elvis Santino, and the ship's command team eventually removes him from his supervisory role. Honor blossoms in the environment standing out among the four midshipmen on their snotty cruise, but later learns a tough real-life lesson on command when the War Maiden battles a separatist Silesian ship, and takes heavy damage. Several of her fellow midshipmen as well as much of the crew are casualties. It survives only because Honor, the assistant tactical officer, is able to act when the Captain is disabled and other ranking officers in Auxiliary Control are cut off and trapped by battle damages. The title is a clear nod to C.S. Forester's \\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\\" short story. =Changer of Worlds= : (HHA3) : When Honor Harrington returns to the family seat on 'pregnancy leave' with the mated treecats Nimitz and Samantha, after her kittens are born the two parents return to his clan after years in space. Honor in fact, spends her time with the Weapons Development Board and reports out the design concepts for the new classes of warships her experience with LAC carrier Q-ships and missile pods have given her during her recent tour in Silesia (Honor Among Enemies HH06). After hearing first-hand testimony of the perils and dangers of the ongoing Haven-Manticore war, and the possible annihilation the war entails for their race, the treecats are revealed to have a world spanning society and organization. An organization of elders that has concealed the true abilities of treecats for centuries from mankind, and one that now makes the momentous decision to extend their range off-world and \\"colonize\\" other worlds. This is the background explanation of why other adult treecats migrated off planet leading to their arrival on Grayson during the beginning of In Enemy Hands. =From the Highlands= : by Eric Flint : In the eve of a former Havenite admiral, Amos Parnell's arrival to Old Earth to testify against the excesses and crimes of the Havenite regime, Helen Zilwicki, daughter of Captain Anton Zilwicki of the Royal Manticoran Navy, finds herself in the midst of an underground fight between StateSec agents, anti-slavery terrorists, mercenaries and an unscrupulous supercorporation centered on the rogue planet of Mesa, \\"Manpower Incorporated\\". This story reprises the Zilwicki family survivors who were first introduced in The Short Victorious War in the action where Mrs. Zilwicki was killed. This story along with Fanatic (in HHA4) serve together as background for the Wages of Sin spin-off novel sub-series books Crown of Slaves and Torch of Freedom, geographically covering events in the Solarian League Meyers Sector or the Torch-Erewhon region among the verge systems. =Nightfall= : (HHA3) : The story of Oscar Saint-Just's accession to power as sole dictatorial ruler of the terror driven People's Republic of Haven. This story was most likely originally part of Ashes of Victory (in which it is a turning point in the plot), but cut down to a summary to save space. In the tale, the ambitious Havenite Secretary of War, Admiral Esther McQueen, who had long been at odds with Oscar Saint-Just and who had been carefully planning a coup against the ruling Committee of Public Safety which rubber stamps decisions made by Saint-Just and Chairman Rob Pierre, is forced to make her move before time, and her troops fight against the State Security forces commanded by Saint-Just throughout the streets of Nouveau Paris. The overthrow of the Committee seems imminent and civil war is about to break in the planet Haven, until Saint-Just makes a frightening move of his own.

Appearances The Monty Python team consciously decided to avoid recurring characters. Along with Terry Jones/Terry Gilliam's nude organist, Michael Palin's \\"It's\\" man, the Gumbys and Graham Chapman's Colonel, Mr Praline was one of the few deemed popular and useful enough for multiple appearances.Johnson 1999, p.51. Praline's initial appearance was in a first series episode during a vox pop segment, to announce that he would be appearing later in the show.Johnson 1999, p. 90 This he did as a Police Inspector, following up on the case of Whizzo's Chocolates (hence his name, praline being a kind of hazelnut confection), which produced such gems as Cockroach Cluster, Anthrax Ripple, and the titular Crunchy Frog. Praline's defining moment came in two episodes later, when he attempted to return his recently purchased dead parrot to the pet shop from which he had bought it, not half an hour ago at that very boutique. This segment has been called the comedy team's single best-known sketch,Johnson 1999, p. 96. and it led to Praline's appearance in the team's first theatrical release, And Now for Something Completely Different (1971) which included a remake of the sketch.Johnson 1999, p. 220. In a second series episode Praline had more pet trouble, this time trying to buy a fish licence for his pet halibut, Eric. In this sketch, he mentions that he also has a cat and a dog named Eric among others and has acquired a (fraudulent) licence for the cat. This final sketch led to Praline singing the song \\"Eric The Half-A- Bee\\" on the Monty Python's Previous Record album.Johnson 1999, p. 141. Cleese eventually got so fed up with \\"doing the one with the parrot\\", that he vowed never again to perform the sketch; conversely, the Eric the Half-A-Bee segment is one of Cleese's personal favourites. It includes the revelation that Praline's first name is also Eric. In episode 18, \\"Live from the Grill-o-mat\\", Praline appears with his flatmate Brooky (Eric Idle) as the host of a new chat show. However, the show in the sketch is cancelled and they later appear in \\"The Seven Brides For Seven Brothers Sketch\\".Johnson 1999, p. 129. A Variety photo shoot during the filming of Monty Python's Life of Brian in Tunisia resulted in the character's post-TV-series appearance. The comedy team was photographed in costume against mosques and palm trees; Michael Palin noted in his diary: \\"Nostalgia time. John was dressed in his Pacamac as Praline, complete with dead parrot.\\" Character Robert Ross' Monty Python Encyclopedia notes that Mr Praline has become a beloved figure within the Python canon. He has been discussed in Python-related literature as well as works not specifically dealing with the comedy team. Praline has an incredulous tone and exaggerated, somewhat high-pitched English accent with Scottish elements. Ross describes Praline's character as \\"slightly creepy\\", with a \\"British air of oppressed madness\\". Literature Through Film: Realism, Magic, and the Art of Adaptation (2004) holds Praline up as an example of a \\"Sancho-like realist\\". The 2006 book The Best British Stand-Up and Comedy Routines describes the disgruntled Mr Praline as \\"all plastered down hair and plastic raincoat\\". Edward Slowik writes that in the \\"Fish Licence\\" sketch, Praline provides an example of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist concept of \\"bad faith\\". In this concept, a denial of individual freedom can result when a person fails to accept that past choices and behavior determine one's character. By declaring \\"I am not a loony!\\" when his actions have shown he is clearly insane, Praline exhibits Sartrean \\"bad faith\\".

Movement Drum Co. 4-in-1 Pad Remo's WeatherKing RT series Practice pad A practice pad or drum pad, is a type of percussion implement utilized by drummers and percussionists to quietly practice or warm up before a performance. Many percussionists practice primarily using practice pads. Practice pads have adapted to fit the needs of different percussion drums. In recent years, a variety of types of practice pads have been designed to assist percussionists. These implements may commonly include the use of both an actual disk of mylar or similar element (equivalent to material used in the construction of true drumheads). This typically is stretched over an underlying buffer, affixed by way of a rim of metal or plastic to an underlying rigid surface to approximate the stretch and reflection similar to that a true drumhead when struck, such as REMO's RT series drum practice pad (displayed to the right). Many more modern devices utilize a thin layer of elastomer, such as natural gum rubber or synthetic rubber equivalent consisting of various densities as a playing surface. This type of rubber surface, (having become a significantly standard appliance when fabricating most modern practice drum pads), is either placed directly over the top of an existing drumhead in some form, or adhered onto the top of a dense and flat substrate (usually wood) allowing for the material to reflect a drumstick or mallet after being struck, which generally bears a response and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù to the players that is similar to that of a true drumhead. OffWorld Percussion's Invader Pro-Rudimental snare practice pad Practice pad implements can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and by typical design, may be adequately compact (thin) and lightweight for ease in transport. Many variances include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), receivers affixed to or embedded onto the base of the implement to allow for attachment to existing percussion hardware, a cymbal stand thread or snare drum stand for example. Modification to the base of the device can be fashioned to rest affixed via a strap to the player‚Äôs knee. A simulation of snare-drum-style resonance can be implied via various hardware features added to the implement. These devices can be placed on a myriad of surfaces, including directly onto the top batter head of an actual 14‚Äù snare drum or other drum (one possessing a true rim bearing a diameter greater than the total span of the base of the device), which, when struck, could have the added effect of transferring to the drum‚Äôs natural snare-side response along with severely muting the sound of the drum. Several like units are often mounted in an array, akin to that of a standard drum kit assemblage for practice purposes, and so on.

It is usually simmered overnight for 12 hours or more, and eaten for lunch on Shabbat (the Sabbath). Cholent was developed over the centuries to conform with Jewish laws that prohibit cooking on the Sabbath. The pot is brought to a boil on Friday before the Sabbath begins, and kept on a blech or hotplate, or left in a slow oven or electric slow cooker, until the following day. Cholent originated in ancient Judea, possibly as far back as the Second Temple period, and over the centuries various Jewish diaspora communities created their own variations of the dish. There are many variations of the dish, which is standard in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi kitchens.A Pot Full of Beans and Love, Haaretz, 10 November 2008. The basic ingredients of cholent are meat, potatoes, beans and barley. Sephardi-style hamin often uses rice or wheat kernels and chickpeas instead of beans and barley, and chicken instead of beef. A traditional Sephardi addition is whole eggs in the shell (huevos haminados), which turn brown overnight. Ashkenazi cholent often contains kishke (a sausage casing) or helzel (a chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture). Slow overnight cooking allows the flavors of the various ingredients to permeate and produces the characteristic taste of cholent. Etymology Max Weinreich traces the etymology of cholent to the Latin present participle calentem (an accusative firm of calƒìns), meaning \\"that which is hot\\" (as in calorie), via Old French (present participle of , from the verb , \\"to warm\\").Max Weinreich, History of the Yiddish Language, University of Chicago Press, Chicago (1980), p. 400.E. Einhorn, Old French: A Concise Handbook, Cambridge University Press (1974), p. 150. One widely quoted folk etymology derives the word from French (\\"hot\\") and (\\"slow\\"). Another folk etymology derives cholent (or ) from the Hebrew , which means \\"that rested [overnight]\\". This refers to the old-time cooking tradition of Jewish families placing their individual pots of cholent into the town baker's ovens that always stayed hot and slow-cooked the food overnight. Another possible etymology is from Old French (hot lentils). Hamin (, pronounced ·∏•amin), the Sephardi version of cholent popular also in Israel, derives from the Hebrew word ('hot'), as it is always served fresh off the stove, oven, or slow cooker. The origin of this name is the Mishnaic phrase (Hebrew for \\"wrap the hot things\\"),M. Shabbat 2:7 which essentially provides the Rabbinical prescription for keeping food hot for the Sabbath without lighting a fire.\\"He may put his victuals into the stove for the purpose of keeping them warm\\", Tractate Shabbat, 2:8\\"Cooked victuals may be put on a stove that was heated with straw or stubble\\", Tractate Shabbat, 3:1 The Arabic words used in Morocco are sakhina ( diminutive of \\"hot\\") and dafina ( diminutive of \\"buried\\"). Traditional Shabbat food Vegetable cholent assembled in a slow cooker before Shabbat In traditional Jewish families, Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi, cholent or hamin is the hot main course of the midday Shabbat meal served on Saturdays after the morning synagogue services. Secular Jewish families in Israel also serve cholent. The dish is more popular in the winter. Cholent may be served on Shabbat in synagogues at a kiddush celebration after the conclusion of the Shabbat services, at the celebratory reception following an aufruf (when an Ashkenazi Jewish groom is called up to the Torah reading on the Shabbat prior to the wedding) or at bar and bat mitzvah receptions held on Shabbat morning. Lighting a fire and cooking food are among the activities prohibited on Shabbat by the written Torah. Therefore, cooked Shabbat food, such as cholent or hamin, must be prepared before the onset of the Jewish Shabbat ‚Äì by some as early as Thursdays and certainly not later than Friday afternoon. The pre-cooked food may then be kept hot for the Shabbat meal by the provision in the Rabbinical oral law, which explains that one may use a fire that was lit before Shabbat to keep warm food that was already cooked before Shabbat. Rabbi Zerachiah ben Isaac Ha-Levi Gerondi (Hebrew: ◊®◊ë◊ô◊†◊ï ◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô◊î ◊î◊ú◊ï◊ô), the Baal Ha-Maor (author of the book Ha-Maor), went as far as to write that \\"he who does not eat warm food (on Shabbos) should be checked out to see if he is not a Min (a heretic)\\".Safer Ha-Maor in Tractate Shabbat Perek Kirah The reasoning behind such austerity is that the Karaites interpreted the Torah verse, \\"You shall not [burn] (Heb: bi‚Äòer the pi‚Äòel form of ba‚Äòar) a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat\\" to indicate that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. In Rabbinic Judaism however, the qal verb form ba‚Äòar is understood to mean \\"burn\\", whereas the pi\`el form (present here) is understood to be not intensive as usual but causative. (The rule being that the pi'el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif'il.) Hence bi\`er means \\"kindle\\", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits only starting a fire on Shabbat. History Cholent, or Hamin, originated in ancient Judea, as far back as the Second Temple period.https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/food/shabbat-cholent-the-ultimate-slow- food-1.8178 Such a dish that was cooked slowly in a pit is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud.https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/cholent-the-sabbath- stew/ Some scholars believe that the dish was created by the Pharisees, a Jewish sect active in Second Temple-era Judea, as they interpreted the Biblical verse \\"You shall not kindle fire in any of your dwelling places on the Sabbath day\\" as a prohibition against kindling a fire during Shabbat but not maintaining one, while another Jewish sect, the Sadducees, interpreted it as a prohibition against maintaining any fire on Shabbat, even one kindled before Shabbat, and thus ate cold food on Shabbat. It allegedly became a matter of principle to eat it as a counter to the intepretation of the Sadducees.https://www.aish.com/j/fs/The-Laws-of- Cholent.htmlhttps://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484251/jewish/Why- do-we-eat-Cholent-on-Shabbat.htmhttps://www.aish.com/sh/r/Chollent.html As the Jewish diaspora grew with Jewish migrations into Europe, North Africa, and elsewhere in the Middle East and Central Asia, Jewish diaspora communities developed their own variations of the dish based on the local climate and available ingredients.https://www.timesofisrael.com/ancient-jewish-dish-of- cholent-is-now-a-melting-pot-of-israeli-cuisine/ Variations of cholent continued to be eaten in the Land of Israel throughout the centuries. Ashkenazi-style cholent was first mentioned in 1180, in the writings of Rabbi Yitzhak of Vienna.Cholent with real soul In the shtetls of Europe, religious neighborhoods in Jerusalem, and other cities in the Land of Israel before the advent of electricity and cooking gas, a pot with the assembled but uncooked ingredients was brought to the local baker before sunset on Fridays. The baker would put the pot with the cholent mixture in his oven, which was always kept fired, and families would come by to pick up their cooked cholent on Saturday mornings. The same practice was observed in Morocco, where black pots of s‚Äôhina (see Variations below) were placed overnight in bakers‚Äô ovens and then delivered by bakers‚Äô assistants to households on Shabbat morning. The unique cooking requirements of cholent were the inspiration for the invention of the slow cooker.Naxon, Lenore. \\"My Dad, the Inventor of the Crock Pot.\\" Beyond Bubbie. 8 April 2013. 2 May 2013. In modern Israel, cholent has become a dish widely available in restaurants. In 2013, cholenterias, casual restaurants specializing in cholent, emerged in Bnei Brak and the Haredi neighborhoods of Jerusalem, and became the premier night hangout areas for Haredi men between their Torah study sessions. Soon afterwards, cholent dishes spread to restaurants in secular areas.https://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2018/02/05/cholent-craze-secular-tel- aviv/ Variations Cholent of beans and potatoes In Germany, the Netherlands, and European countries the special hot dish for the Shabbat lunch is known as , , or . These western Yiddish words are straight synonyms of the eastern Yiddish cholent.Schalet in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1993), p. 2710. The Jewish people of Hungary adapted the Hungarian dish s√≥let to serve the same purpose as cholent. S√≥let was likely modified by the Jewish people living in Pannonia when the Magyars arrived.Raphael Patai, The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology, Wayne State University Press, Detroit (1996), p. 21. In Morocco, the hot dish eaten by Jews on the Sabbath is traditionally called s‚Äôhina or skhina (Arabic for \\"the warm dish\\";Joelle Bahloul, \\"Food Practices Among Sephardic Immigrants in Contemporary France: Dietary Laws in Urban Society\\", Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 63(3):485‚Äì96; cf. pp. 488, 491. Hebrew spellingRivka Levy-Melloul, Moroccan Cooking, Jerusalem Publishing House, Jerusalem (1982), pp. 73‚Äì77 . ◊°◊õ◊ô◊†◊ê). S'hina is made with chickpeas, rice or hulled wheat, potatoes, meat, and whole eggs simmering in the pot.John Cooper, Eat and Be Satisfied: A Social History of Jewish Food, Jason Aronson, Northvale, New Jersey (1993), pp. 101‚Äì07, 183‚Äì90. In Spain and the Maghreb a similar dish is called adafina or dafina, from the Arabic d'fina or t‚Äôfina for \\"buried\\" (which echoes the Mishnaic phrase \\"bury the hot food\\"). Adafina was popular in Medieval Judeo-Iberian cuisine, but today it is mainly found as dafina in North African Jewish cuisine. The Sephardic Jews of the Old City of Jerusalem used to eat a traditional meal called macaroni hamin that consists of macaroni, chicken and potatoes. It was traditionally flipped upside down when served, just like maqluba. In Bukharan Jewish cuisine, a hot Shabbat dish with meat, rice, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste is called oshi sabo (or osh savo).Oshi sabo recipe ; recipe in English from Jewish Woman , Fall 2005. The name of the dish in Persian or Bukharian Jewish dialect means \\"hot food [oshi or osh] for Shabbat [sabo or savo]\\", reminiscent of both hamin and s'hina. Among Iraqi Jews, the hot Shabbat meal is called t'bit and it consists of whole chicken skin filled with a mixture of rice, chopped chicken meats, and herbs. The stuffed chicken skin in tebit calls to mind the Ashkenazi helzel, chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour and onion mixture that often replaces (or supplements) the kishke in European cholent recipes. Indian Jews in Bombay traditionally ate a similar dish of chicken and rice together with curry spices such as ginger, turmeric, and cardamon. Ethiopian Jews traditionally eat a kosher version of doro wat on Shabbat. =Ashkenazi cholent recipes= There are many recipes for making cholent. Ingredients vary according to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and according to the preferences of the cook. The core ingredients of a traditional cholent are beans, usually a mixture of several kinds with varying size; grains, most commonly barley; and beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other fatty cut. Other common ingredients are sauteed onions and potatoes. The mixture is seasoned, mainly with salt, pepper, garlic, and spices, and water is added to create a stew-like consistency during overnight slow cooking. While beef is the traditional meat ingredient, alternative meats may include chicken, turkey, veal, frankfurters, or even goose (echoing the French cassoulet). Other vegetables such as carrots, sweet potato, and zucchini may be added. For additional flavor and browning, some cooks add unpeeled onions or a small amount of sugar caramelized in oil. Some are known to add also beer or whiskey for extra flavor. A common addition to cholent is kishke or helzel. Kishke is a type of kosher sausage stuffed with a flour mixture, chicken or goose fat, fried onions and spices. Traditionally, kishke was made with intestinal lining from a cow. Today, the casing is often an edible synthetic casing such as that used for salami or hot dogs. Helzel is chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture similar to kishke and sewed with a thread and needle to ensure that it remains intact in long cooking. =Sephardi hamin recipes= Hamin Sephardi-style hamin calls for whole, stuffed vegetables in addition to meat or chicken. Whole vegetables such as tomatoes, green peppers, eggplant halves and zucchini are stuffed with a mixture of beef and rice, and are then placed into the pot with meat or chicken and chickpeas. Sephardim also add spices such as cumin and hot peppers. The ingredients and spiciness of hamin varies from area to area. Iraqi Jews prepare their version of cholent, known as tebit, with a whole chicken stuffed with rice. Jews from Morocco or Iberia make a version called adafina or dafina, which calls for spices like garlic, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and pepper, as well as whole eggs that turn brown and creamy during the long cooking process. The Spanish cocido ('stew') containing chicken and chickpeas is a likely offshoot of the traditional hamin of the Spanish Jews. Yemenite Jews have developed various kinds of breads similar to puff pastry cooked for ten hours, including jachnun and kubaneh (eaten in the morning of the Sabbath rather than at mid-day, with dairy meals). A popular Sephardi variation of cholent is Haminados. It typically includes whole eggs in the shell, which are placed on top of the Hamin mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (g√ºevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed on top of the other cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a sabich sandwich. Literary references Cholent is the subject of a poem by Heinrich Heine. He writes (using the German word schalet for cholent), \\"Schalet, ray of light immortal! / Schalet, daughter of Elysium!\\" / So had Schiller's song resounded, / Had he ever tasted schalet. / For this schalet is the very- / Food of heaven, which, on Sinai, / God Himself instructed Moses in the secret of preparing... (trans. Leland).Princess Sabbath, The Works of Heinrich Heine, Romancero, Third Book, Hebrew Melodies, William Heineman, London, 1905. In Here Comes Mrs. Kugelman, a novel about preservation of the memory of a Polish town before the Holocaust, Minka Pradelski describes how the various cholents of the town of Bedzin were brought to the town baker on Friday afternoon to be placed in the large oven of the bakery so that they would cook and remain hot until ready to be eaten the next day for the Sabbath meal. The Twins from France, an Orthodox Jewish acrobatic duo, produced a DVD called Cholent, as it's a compilation of them doing various unrelated pieces.

Many sales representatives rely on a sequential sales process that typically includes nine steps. Some sales representatives develop scripts for all or part of the sales process. The sales process can be used in face-to- face encounters and in telemarketing. Definition Personal selling can be defined as \\"the process of person-to-person communication between a salesperson and a prospective customer, in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy something of value, such as a good or service.\\"Cant, M.C. and van Heerde, C.V., Personal Selling, Juta, 2004, p. 3 The term may also be used to describe a situation where a company uses a sales force as one of the main ways it communicates with customers. Brief history The earliest forms of exchange involved bartering systems. However, the advent of coinage enabled exchange to occur more efficiently and over much larger distances. The earliest references to selling, involving coin-based exchange, comes from Herodotus who noted that \\"The Lydians were the first people we know of to use a gold and silver coinage and to introduce the retail trade.\\" Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, \\"A History of Marketing Thought,\\" in Handbook of Marketing, Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41, Online: https://www.researchgate.netpublication235362475_A_History_of_Marketing_Thought This implies that selling and buying, originated in the 7th century BCE, in the area now known as Turkey. From there, selling spread along Mediterranean, and then diffused throughout the civilized world.Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, \\"A History of Marketing Thought,\\" in Handbook of Marketing, Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41 The Socratic philosophers expressed some concerns about the new type of selling in around the 4th century BCE. Their commentary was primarily concerned with potential disruption of the more social aspects of selling. Traditional forms of exchange encouraged a social perspective - emphasising the social bonds that united members of a society. For example, during periods of drought or famine, individuals shared in the plight of their neighbours. However, the advent of this new form of selling encouraged a focus on the individual such that in times of scarcity, sellers raised their prices.Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, \\"A History of Marketing Thought,\\" in Handbook of Marketing, Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, pp 41-42 During the Medieval period, trade underwent further changes. Localised trading based on transactional exchange and bartering systems was slowly transformed as transportation improved and new geographic markets were opened.Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1992 From the 11th century, the Crusades helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, Marco Polo stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth, notably silk, glass, jewellery and many other luxury goods. As trade between countries or regions grew, trade networks became more complex and different types of sellers filled in the spaces within the network. During the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants in a home office and a system of agents who operated in different geographic markets.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22‚Äì26 Exchange was often conducted at arm's length, rather than face-to-face. Local market traders and itinerant peddlers continued to supply basic necessities, but permanent retail shops gradually emerged from the 13th century, especially in the more populous cities.Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., The Buildings of England: Cheshire Penguin, 1978, p. 170 By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold a very broad range of general merchandise, much like a contemporary general store.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129 Large business houses involved in import and export often offered additional services including finance, bulk-breaking, sorting and risk-taking. In the 17th century, the public began to make mental distinctions between two types of trader; local traders (Dutch: meerseniers) which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the merchants (Dutch: koopman), which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of merchants who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10 In 18th century England, large industrial houses, such as Wedgewood, began mass-producing certain goods such as pottery and ceramics and needed a form of mass distribution for their products. Some peddlers were employed by these industrial producers to act as a type of travelling sales representative, calling on retail and wholesale outlets in order to make a sale.Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., \\"Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay,\\" Journal of Marketing Management, Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291 In England, these peddlers were known as Manchester men because of the prevalence of the practice in the sale of cotton cloth manufactured in Manchester.Silver, A.W., Manchester Men and Indian Cotton, 1847-1872, pp 54-58 and p. 226 Employed by a factory or entrepreneur, they sold goods from shop to shop rather than door to door and were thus operating as a type of wholesaler or distribution intermediary.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, p. 33 They were the precursors to the field sales representative. Selling roles and situations Sales activity can occur in many types of situations. Field representatives call on clients, who are typically business clients; door-to-door sales teams call on householders, sales staff may work in a retail or wholesale environment where sales personnel attend to customers by processing orders or sales may occur in a telemarketing environment where the sales person makes telephone calls to prospects. In terms of number of transactions, most selling occurs at the retail level; but in terms of value, most selling occurs at the high-end business-to-business level.Murphy, P.E., \\"George E Brenkert- Marketing Ethics,\\" [Book Review], Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 24 May 2009 Different types of sales roles can be identified: * Order takers refers to selling that occurs primarily at the wholesale or retail levels. Order processing involves determining the customer needs, pointing to inventory that meets the customer needs and completing the order.Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., Contemporary Marketing, Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 579 * Order getters refers to the in-field sales activity where a sales representative travels to the client's home or work place to makes a sales presentation in order to win new business or to maintain relations with existing clients.Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., Contemporary Marketing, Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 580 * Missionary selling is often seen as a sales support role. The missionary sales person distributes information about products or services, describes product attributes and leaves materials but does not normally close the sale. The missionary sales person often prepares the way for a field sales person. For example, a pharmaceutical sales representative may call on doctors and leave samples, manufacturer information such as results of clinical trials, copies of relevant journal articles etc. in an effort to persuade doctors to prescribe a medication or course of treatment. * Cold calling refers to a situation when a sales representative telephones or visits a customer without a prior appointment. Cold calling is often considered to be the most challenging of the sales activities. In a cold calling situation, the sales representative is likely to be more conscious of the client's time, and may seek to condense the sales process by combining the approach and the sales presentation into a single step.Boyan, L., Successful Cold Call Selling, American Management Association, 1989 * Relationship selling (also known as consultative selling) refers to a sales practice that involves building and maintaining interactions with customers in order to enhance long term relationships. Relationship selling often involves a problem solving approach where the sales representative acts in a consultative role and becomes a partner in the client's problem-solving exercise.Lamb, C.W.L., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., Marketing, South-Western, 2011, p. 286 Relationship selling is often found in high-tech selling environments.

To identify prospects, sales representatives might use a variety of sources such as business directories (for corporate clients), commercial databases or mailing lists or simply look at internal records such as lists of lapsed customers. The aim of prospecting is to increase the likelihood that sales staff spend time with potential clients who have an interest in the product or service. :Qualifying leads‚ÄìAfter identifying potential customers, the sales team must determine whether prospects represent genuine potential customers. This part of the process is known as qualifying leads, or leads who are likely to buy. Qualified leads are those who have a need for the product, a capacity to pay and a willingness to pay for the product, and are willing to be contacted by the salesperson. :Pre-approach‚ÄìRefers to the process of preparing for the presentation. This consists of customer research, goal planning, scheduling an appointment and any other tasks necessary to prepare for the sales presentation. :Approach‚ÄìRefers to the stage when the salesperson initially meets with the customer. Since first contact leaves an impression on the buyer, professional conduct, including attire, a handshake, and eye contact, is advised. :Need assessment‚ÄìAn important component of the sales presentation is the assessment of the customer's needs. Salespeople should evaluate the customer based on the need for the product. Sales representatives typically ask questions designed to reveal the prospective client's current situation, the source of any problems, the impact of the problems, the benefits of the solution, the client's prior experience with the brand or the category, the prospect's general level of interest and readiness to purchase. In the case of corporate clients, it may be necessary to ascertain any limitations on the prospect's authority to make a purchase (e.g. financial restrictions). :Sales presentation‚ÄìOnce the salesperson knows the needs, he or she is ready for the presentation. Sales representatives often follow the AIDA model, which allows them to lead the prospect through the standard stages of the purchase decision process. The steps in the AIDA process are to grab the customer‚Äôs Attention, ignite Interest, create Desire, and inspire Action (AIDA). The salesperson can do this through product demonstrations and presentations that show the features, advantages and benefits of the product. :Handling objections‚ÄìAfter the presentation, the sales person must be ready to handle any objections. Customers who are interested will voice their concerns, usually in one of four ways. They might question the price or value of the product, dismiss the product/service as inadequate, avoid making a commitment to buy, or refuse because of an unknown factor. Salespeople should do their best to anticipate objections and respectfully respond to them. :Closing‚ÄìWhen the sales person feels that the prospect is ready, they will seek to gain commitment and close the sale. If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‚Äòalternative close‚Äô, the ‚Äòassumptive close‚Äô, the ‚Äòsummary close‚Äô, or the ‚Äòspecial-offer close‚Äô, among others. :Follow-up‚ÄìFinally, the salesperson must remember to follow up after the sale has been concluded. Following up will ensure customer satisfaction and help establish a relationship with the customer. Sales scripts Historically, itinerant medicine salesmen used tightly written scripts that induced audiences to buy The use of tightly written sales scripts has been known for hundreds of years. Itinerant medicine salesmen were known to use sales scripts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Experienced sales representatives soon recognise that specific words and phrases have the capacity to elicit desirable behaviours on the part of the prospect. Research studies can also be carried out to determine the most effective words/phrases or the optimal sequence of words/phrases for use in effective sales scripts. A number of research studies have focussed on the types of the use of verbal persuasive techniques that can be used to convince prospects such as information exchange, the use of recommendations, requests, promises, or ingratiation.Fennis, B.M. and Stel, M., \\"The Pantomime of Persuasion: Fit Between Nonverbal Communication and Influence Strategies,\\" Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2011, doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.01 Other research has focused on influence techniques employed. Well-known examples include the: :Door-In-The-Face‚Äìtechnique (DITF): where the target request is presented as a concession to an unreasonably large initial requestCialdini, R. B., Vincent, J. E., Lewis, S. K. Catal an, J., Wheeler, D., & Darby, B.L., \\"Reciprocal concessions procedure for inducing compliance: The Door-In-The- Face technique,\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 31, pp 206-215 :Disrupt-Then-Reframe‚Äìtechnique (DTR): where a conventional sales script is interrupted by a subtle, odd element (i.e., a disruptive element) and then followed by a persuasive phrase that concludes the script (i.e., ‚Äúreframing‚Äù)Price-Davis, B. and Knowles, E.S., \\"A Disrupt-Then-Reframe Technique of Social Influence,\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 76, No. 2, 1999, pp 192-199 Once identified, these words, phrases and techniques can be used to build highly effective sales scripts that are known to work.Niblick, J., The Profitable Consultant: Starting, Growing, and Selling Your Expertise, Wiley, 2013 The most effective sales scripts can be codified and used by other sales persons or in sales training. A brush salesman and his bicycle in the 1950s Many sales scripts are designed to move the prospect sequentially through the cognitive, affective and behavioural stages of the purchase decision process and are designed around the AIDA model (attention ‚Üíinterest ‚Üídesire ‚Üíaction). Most sales representatives include a greeting, closing and call to action in their scripts. A call to action (CTA) is simply an instruction to the prospect designed to prompt an immediate response. It often involves the use of an imperative verb such as \\"try it now\\" or \\"find out more.\\"Eisenberg, B., CALL TO ACTION: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results, Nashville, Tennessee, Thomas Nelson, 2006, p. 20 Other types of calls-to-action might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time, e.g. 'Limited stocks available' or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint, e.g. 'Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order'. The key to a powerful call-to-action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions. Sales representatives also learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that potentially signal the prospect's readiness to buy. For instance, if a prospect begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, \\"Does it come in any other colours (or styles)? indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as \\"Do you have this model in black?\\" then this indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy.Cant, M.C. and van Heerden, C.H., Personal Selling, Juta Academic, 2008, p. 176 When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a trial close might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is \\"Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?\\" or \\"Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?\\" Sales scripts are used for both inbound and outbound sales. Sales scripts are commonly used in cold calling, especially phone-based cold calling such as telemarketing (outbound selling) and can also be found in chat-based customer care centres (inbound calling). In such cases, the sales script might be confined to a simple list of talking points that the sales person uses as a reference during their conversation with the prospect.Hogan, P., \\"What are Sales Scripts?\\" Tenfold Blog =Types= By 1915, an estimated 2,000 \\"Rawleigh men\\" distributed Rawleigh products while visiting approximately 20,000 customers daily. Some sales pitches are entirely scripted while others are only partially scripted allowing the individual sales representatives the flexibility to vary the presentation according to their assessment of the client's needs and interests. However, most effective sales representatives develop scripts for handling common objections and almost always have a number of different trial closes at hand. There are three broad types of sales script:Solomon, M. R., Surprenant, C. F., Czepiel, J.A. and Suprenant, C.F. \\"A Role Theory Perspective on Dyadic Interactions: The Service Encounter‚Äù (1991) in Bateson, J, Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings, Dryden, Orlando, Fl, pp 106- 122 Prescribed scripts Prescribed scripts are highly detailed scripts which specify precise phrases to be used in given situations. Prescribed scripts are widely used in a variety of contexts including direct selling, market research, fast food service. The main advantages of prescribed scripts are: * can enable speedy transactions * provides uniform delivery. The main disadvantages of a prescribed script are: * tendency for the delivery to become robotic and lacking in authenticity Goal-driven scripts Goal driven scripts are more flexible. This type of script defines the goals for each type of transaction and allow employees to use their own phrases during the encounter. Provided that employees have a clear picture of the goals and purpose, goal- driven scripts can appear more natural and authentic. However the use of goal- driven scripts requires employees with well developed communication skills. Hybrid approach Street peddlers are a relatively common sight across Asia The hybrid approach offers a choice within a range of scripts. This approach is neither prescribed nor totally flexible. It provides a range of scripts from which employees select an option with which they feel comfortable.

The stories in the anthologies serve to introduce characters, provide deeper more complete backstory and flesh out the universe, so claim the same canonical relevance as exposition in the main series. David Weber, author of the mainline Honor Harrington series, serves as editor for the anthologies, maintaining fidelity to the series canons. The book contains the following stories: ; \\"Promised Land\\" by Jane Lindskold : Michael Winton, brother of Queen Elizabeth III and Crown Prince of Manticore, embarks on his \\"snotty\\" cruise following his studies at Saganami Naval Academy. Determined to prove that he can be more than the Heir to the Throne, Michael requests to be assigned to a ship on patrol deployment instead of a \\"safe\\" posting in the Manticoran home system. He is assigned to the light cruiser Intransigent, which is sent to the planet Masada on a diplomatic mission. :Meanwhile, Judith, a young Grayson girl captured by Masadan privateers and forced to marry their leader, becomes the greatest hope of a secret sisterhood of Masadan women who are plotting their escape from the religious fanatics of their world. ; With One Stone by Timothy Zahn : The People's Republic of Haven tests a secret weapon. Bad news for them: their intended victim turns out to be Honor Harrington. Good news for Manticore: Honor's solution to the problem gives them a secret weapon of their own. ; \\"A Ship Named Francis\\" by John Ringo and Victor Mitchell : Sean Tyler, a corpsman in the Royal Manticoran Navy, thought that a stint as a loaner in the explosively-growing Grayson Space Navy would boost his career. So, when there was a slot vacant on board the cruiser Francis Mueller, his wish was granted. Unfortunately for Corpsman Tyler, no one told him that almost everybody on board the Francis‚Äîfrom the clueless captain to the psychotic XO and the panicky chaplain‚Äîhad been sent there because no one else in the entire Grayson Space Navy wants them. ; \\"Let's Go to Prague\\" by John Ringo : A pair of Manticoran special forces operatives discover that a holiday can be even more fun if it involves spoiling StateSec's day. ; Fanatic by Eric Flint : When the senior People's Commissioner assigned to a backwater sector of the People's Republic of Haven is found murdered, Oscar Saint-Just, now the dictator of Haven, sends a young and idealistic StateSec officer by the name of Victor Cachat to investigate. Confronting and terrorizing both Navy and StateSec personnel with his ruthlessness, Cachat orders broad reorganizations in the sector's military and security forces which may have more than \\"cleaning the house\\" in mind. But Cachat may be the right man in the right place at the right time when news of Saint-Just's overthrow reach his sector. Background for Crown of Slaves. ; The Service of the Sword by David Weber : Abigail Hearns, the daughter of a prominent Grayson Steadholder, has grown up idolizing Honor Harrington ever since she witnessed her defense of Abigail's homeworld from the Masadans. Out of sheer determination, she attended Saganami Naval Academy to become the first Grayson midshipwoman. She is sent for her \\"snotty\\" cruise on board the heavy cruiser HMS Gauntlet, commanded by an irritating Manticoran nobleman who may be more than what he seems. But when Gauntlet is sent to investigate the disappearance of several ships in a backwater region of space, Abigail discovers that the Peeps are definitely not the only bad guys out there: background for The Shadow of Saganami.

It was founded in 1849 as The Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics chiefly by English Anglicans though with the backing and support of Church of Ireland clergy and bishops, with the aim of converting the Roman Catholics of Ireland to Protestantism. The reference to Roman Catholics in the title was removed in 2002. History The inspiration for the beginning of the organization came from the Revd. Alexander Dallas (1791‚Äì1869), Rector of Wonston, Hampshire, who since 1843 had been involved in actively evangelizing Roman Catholic people in Ireland. Dallas began his missionary work in Ireland by sending over 20,000 letters to householders throughout Ireland. He followed this up by sending eight missionaries to preach throughout the country and personally conducted a preaching tour in the West of Ireland in Galway and Connemara. The result of his missionary work by 1848 was the setting up of a missionary school and church in Castlekerke, near Galway.ICM Website . From 1846 the Mission was supported by wealthy English Businessman Edward Durrant.Margaret Aylward (1810-1889 by Donal Brady Dallas advanced the work through the provision of Scripture Readers, missionary clergymen and the support of the Bishops and Clergy of the Church of Ireland. Scripture Readers were fluent Irish speakers who were trained to preach the Gospel and refute what they considered false doctrine. Initially the work of ICM was concentrated in the West of Ireland. However, the 1861 census revealed the ICM's missionary work as a relative failure. The ICM retreated from the west and subsequent work centred on the city of Dublin, where it continued in the attempt to draw converts from the Roman Catholic population. By the time of his death in 1869, Dallas had established 21 churches, 49 schools, and four orphanages and had between 400 and 500 full-time workers employed in preaching the Gospel throughout Ireland. Renowned missionary and explorer Henry Lansdell was the secretary of the organization from 1869‚Äì79. The further continuing gradual decline of the organisation and estrangement from mainstream Anglican thought in southern Ireland is outlined in Moffitt's, The Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics 1849‚Äì1950 (MUP 2011). The evangelistic work of Irish Church Missions on Bachelor's Walk, near O'Connell Street, continues amongst Dublin's student and international community. =Famine= The ICM was particularly controversial during the period of the Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1852) believing the famine to be a judgment from God on Irish Catholics who had clung to the Catholic faith ‚Äì \\"The truth of the Scriptures was verified in the groans of the dying, and their wails for the dead\\". The organisation was also criticised for tying material to spiritual aid. The organisation is synonymous with the souperism of the famine period, particularly in Connemara, where relief was often conditional upon the conversion of the recipient to Anglicanism. The ICM drew much of its support from Britain, while it divided the Church of Ireland. Miriam Moffitt, Postdoctorate Research Fellow at NUI Maynooth stated in her book Soupers and Jumpers, that in reality the poor of Connemara found themselves pawns in a power struggle between the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. The ICM at the time was receiving ¬£26,000 annually in donations from England for their efforts.Frances Taylor, Irish Homes and Irish Hearts, London, 1867, p.97 Some of the ICM projects in the west were in partnership with the Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language. However, Rev. Dallas' anti-catholic tirades cause much dissension within the Irish Society, which, contrary to ICM practice, did not always require its scripture readers to first convert to Anglicanism.A History of Protestant Irish Speakers Among the places set up and funded by the ICM were the Connemara Orphan's Nursery, Spiddal Orphanage, and Aasleagh Orphanage. John Hall, a staunch Protestant and supporter of the ICM, bought Letterfrack from the quaker Ellis family for use by the ICM. It later was taken over by the Roman Catholic Irish Christian Brothers, who used it as a reformatory or \\"industrial school\\". =Ragged Schools and Residential Homes= After the retreat from the west the ICM began more vigorous activity in Dublin particularly in poor areas such as the Liberties.'Lockout: Dublin 1913' By P√°draig Yeates, Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. These efforts and that of other Protestants provoked Roman Catholic opposition, for instance from the Society of St. Vincent De Paul. Rev. Dallas and the Irish Church Missions, with the Anglican philanthropist and proselytiser Mrs Ellen Smyly, helped set up schools and homes in Townsend St., Dublin (John Casey the father of the playwright Sean O'Casey worked here). These were to become the first of her \\"Smyly Homes\\". Rev. Dallas and Ellen Smyly opened The Irish Church Missionaries Ragged School in the Coombe. Opened initially in 1853 in Weaver's Hall, later moved to the corner of Newmarket Street, the home was closed in 1944 and children were moved to the Smyly home in Monkstown. For 20 years the ICM also sponsored a pamphlet Erin's Hope produced by The Smyly Homes and edited by a worker there, Sarah Davies.Charitable words: women, philanthropy, and the language of charity in Nineteenth Century Dublin By Margaret Helen PrestonThem Also: The Story of the Dublin Mission by Sarah Davies. Other Homes or Schools of the Mission were at Lurgan Street Ragged Home, Luke Street Girls' Home and the William Henry Elliott Home. =TC Hammond= Perhaps the most famous of those who served in ICM is Thomas Chatterton Hammond (1877‚Äì1961). He entered the ICM training school in 1895, working as an evangelist for ICM from 1895 to 1899, before studying in Trinity College Dublin for ordination in the Church of Ireland. In 1903 he was ordained as Curate-assistant for St. Kevin's parish in Dublin, becoming its Rector in 1910 until 1919 when he became the Superintendent of ICM. He left ICM in 1936 for Australia to take up the post of Principal of Moore Theological College, Sydney. Hammond was a controversial figure both in Ireland and Australia as a member of the Orange Order, eventually rising to the position of Grand Master of the Orange Institution of New South Wales in 1961. In 2009, his involvement in establishing and sitting on the Managing Committee of the Bethany Home, a Protestant evangelical mother and baby home, was noted., can be viewed at 'From Wicklow to Wakefield ‚Äì a victim of Protestant prejudice and state neglect', http://www.indymedia.ie/article/92984 The home is subject to ongoing calls to be added to the State redress scheme for victims of child abuse. =Orange Order= The Irish Church Missions claims no formal relationship with the Orange Order. The history section of the ICM website states that during the 19th century the organisation formally distanced itself from the Order, though a number of the Society's Scripture Readers were members. However, this distance appears hard to reconcile with the fact that in the twentieth century TC Hammond, Superintendent of the ICM, was a prominent member of the Order. An association can be traced from 1960s, through 2000 and beyond.The ICM and the Orange Order, in Niall Meehan, Church & State and the Bethany Home, p.8, https://www.academia.edu/320793/ Furthermore, the ICM traditionally hosted the annual service of the Dublin- Wicklow Orange Lodge's annual service each October. This practice may have declined since the ICM underwent internal reorganisation and dropped the words 'to the Roman Catholics' from its title. The Mission church on Bachelor's Walk was renamed the Immanuel Church Dublin. However, the ICM continued to receive financial donations from the Dublin-Wiclow and County Antrim Orange Lodges after the year 2000. Stated Positions of the Organisation =Position on Homosexuality= Irish Church Missions maintains a traditionalist stance against homosexual lifestyles. The organisation has also come out against the Civil Partnership Bill, currently before the Irish Parliament, which proposes to grant limited civil recognition and rights in areas such as taxation and kinship to cohabiting same-sex and opposite-sex couples. =Position on Ecumenism= Irish Church Missions maintains a stance against 'theological ecumenism'. The organisation has recently welcomed the framework announced by the Vatican for the transfer of certain groups of Anglo-Catholics as a means of advancing their aims. According to ICM, the move has demonstrated the futility of the theological ecumenical movement. It is the position of the organisation that evangelicalism has always held that there \\"is no squaring the theological circle\\". ICM does however support 'practical ecumenism' with other religious communities in tackling social issues on which there is common ground. =Position on the Church of Ireland= ICM is highly critical of the direction of its own Church, accusing it of developing a liberal identity which they believe 'has nothing to offer Irish society'. The organisation has stated: > \\"According to its own foundational documents, the Church of Ireland is a > Protestant church. Unfortunately, it's a Protestant church without a > Protestant message.\\" =Position on Global Anglicanism= The Superintendent of the Irish Church Missions has been highly critical of the direction of the global Anglican Church, in particular the Archbishop of Canterbury. According to a report in the ICM Magazine, ICM News: > Not only had these Anglican provinces ignored the pleas of the rest of the > Anglican Communion to cease pursuing this unscriptural agenda, but there had > been a manifest failure by the Anglican ‚Äòinstruments of unity‚Äô (especially > the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council, and the > Primates‚Äô meeting) to discipline them for it. It appears from information available from ICM News that it is currently beginning to align itself with the Global Anglican Future Conference, which has come in for some criticism from many leading voices within Anglicanism, including the conservative former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.

The brigade's main area of responsibility is the City of Paris and the surrounding d√©partements of Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne, and Hauts-de- Seine (the petite couronne). It also serves the Centre Spatial Guyanais in Kourou, the DGA Military Rocket Test Centre in Biscarosse, and the Lacq gas field. As with the other fire services of France, the brigade provides technical rescue, search and rescue and fire prevention services, and is one of the providers of emergency medical services. The brigade is one of two fire services in France that is part of the armed forces, with the other being the Marseille Naval Fire Battalion (BMPM). It is a unit of the French Army's Engineering Arm (l'arme du g√©nie) and the firefighters are therefore sappers (sapeurs, thus sapeurs-pompiers). With 8,550 firefighters, it is the largest fire service in Europe and the third largest urban fire service in the world, after the Tokyo Fire Department and New York City Fire Department. Its motto is \\"Save or Perish\\" (French \\"Sauver ou p√©rir\\"). History The Fire Brigade's headquarters in Paris Founded in 1793 as the Corps des gardes-pompes de la ville de Paris and following the 23-hour Austrian Embassy Fire in 1810 became a military organisation by imperial decree of Emperor Napol√©on. On 18 September 1811, it became the Bataillon de sapeurs-pompiers de Paris and was expanded to the R√©giment de sapeurs-pompiers de Paris in 1867. On 1 March 1967 became the Brigade des sapeurs-pompiers de Paris. Selection and training The operational personnel (hommes du rang i.e. privates) are usually engaged for five years. They must have French nationality, be between 18 and 25 years old, have a clean criminal record and have at least a vocational training CAP certificate. The selection is three days long, with sports tests, psychomotor tests, medical examination, etc. Training takes place in the Instruction Grouping (Groupement d'instruction, GI), at the fort of Villeneuve-Saint- Georges. The first period lasts two months, with the first aid and first responder training, and basic military instruction (including shooting). They then undertake practical training of four months in an operational fire company (compagnie d'incendie); this includes taking part in personal assistance and utility safety operations. The last stage of training is a further two months at the Instruction Grouping. Upon completing training, the firefighter joins a fire company.

At the 2016 census, its population was 167,544 in 58,378 families. Lahijan has both traditional and modern architecture. The city, which has an Iranian-European urban structure, lies on the northern slope of the Alborz mountains. Its culture and climatic favorable condition have made Lahijan a major tourist hub in northern Iran. The city is basically founded on the sediments remaining from big rivers in Gilan, including the Sepid/Sefid-Rud (White River). Historically, the city was the major business center and the capital of East Gilan during the time of special rulers. Lahijan has also been a tourism hub of the Islamic world during different eras in Iran's history. Etymology The word \\"Lahijan\\" is originated from the economic stance the city had during its historical periods. \\"LƒÅhijƒÅn\\" is formed by two words: Lah, means silk and \\"Jan or Gan\\" means a place where something is done. Therefore, by compounding these two parts, the word \\"Lahijan or lahigan\\" was made, which means \\"a place to obtain silk fiber\\". Professor Bahram Farah'vashi who is an Iranian expert in ancient languages says that in the Middle Persian Language; Lah refers to silk, and in Decisive Argument; Lah means the red silk. Therefore, Lahygan (today, Lahijan) is an area where silk is obtained. History In ancient times, Gilan region was divided to 'the Caspian' and 'the Golha' (flowers) subregions. Before the Iran's provincial divisions into the current state, Gilan was divided by the Sefid-Rud River into eastern and western regions. The river's eastern side called Biehpish and the western side Biehpas. At some point in time, Lahijan became the capital of Biehpish. This region has been one of Iran's major silk- producing centers as well as the country's first area for the tea-plantation set out by Prince Mohammad Mirza. Prince Mohammad Mirza known as \\"Kashef-ol- Saltaneh\\" who was born in Lahijan was the first mayor of Tehran. As the Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, he knew the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was their biggest business in India at the time. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French laborer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to Iran to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. His mausoleum in Lahijan is now part of the \\"Iran Tea Museum\\". The foundation of Lahijan is attributed to 'Lahij Ebne Saam'. Oljaito, the Mongol ruler conquered Lahijan in 705 AH. Then Amir Teimoor attacked this region. Finally, Shah Abbas I defeated 'Khan Ahmad' and thereafter the Safavid governors ruled this city. Amongst the unpleasant events in the history of this city were the outbreak of plague in 703 AH., the conflagration of 850 AH. and the conquest of it by the Russian army in 1725 AD. Lahijan was one of the main bases of the Jungle Movement. Geography Zahed Gilani's Shrine Lahijan enjoys a climate known as \\"moderate Caspian\\". This weather pattern emerged from the influence of the currents of both the Alborz Mountain slopes and the Caspian Sea. But before knowing about this weather pattern, we should discuss the model of climate system and Gilan's spatial geo system. Gilan includes the north-western end of the Alborz chain and the western part of the Caspian lowlands of Persia. The mountainous belt is cut through by the deep transverse valley of the Sefid-Rud between Manjil and Eemamzadeh Hashem near Rasht, the capital of Gilan Province. To the northwest, the Talesh highlands stretch a continuous watershed separating Gilan and Azerbaijan. Except at their northern end, where the Heyran pass at the top of the ƒÄstƒÅrƒÅƒçƒÅy valley does not exceed 1600 m, they are over high, with three spots over including the Baqrow Da·∏°, the Ajam Da·∏°, and the Shah Mo øallem or Masouleh Da·∏°. Their eastern and north-eastern side is deeply carved by parallel streams flowing down towards the Caspian, resulting in a comb-shaped pattern. The western Alborz itself, to the east of the Safid-rud valley, is wider and more intricate, with three parallel (WNW-ESE) ranges; the southernmost and lowest one is represented in Gilan by the Asman-sara Kuh in the Ammarlu district; the medium one is the most continuous, from the Kuh-e- Dalfak to the Keram Kuh, whereas the transverse valley of Polrud clearly divides the northern range into Kuh-e-Natesh and Kuh-e-Somam or Somamus, the highest spot of Gilan. All these mountains have a very complicated geological structure and tectonic history which connects them to the structural complex of central Persia. Though all those mountains cover a greater area than the plains, these are the most specific feature of the province, and locally, the word Gilan often refers to the plain areas or particularly to the central plain. This large parallelogram of lowlands is heterogeneous and can be divided into two main parts: the delta of the Safid-rud in the east and the Fumanat plain in the west. The former has been entirely built by the Safid- rud, a river with a high discharge and a high alluvial content. The higher part is made out of coarse ancient alluvial material, whereas in the lower part, north of Astaneh-e Ashrafiyyeh, the river often changed its course through thin silty and clayey material; it has thus abandoned its former northeastward course, which flowed into the sea at the prominent angle of the plain near Dastak, and presently flows northwards and builds a smaller living delta jutting out into the Caspian between Zibakenar and Bandar kiashahr. The Fumanat plain to the west intermingles marine alluvial deposits and former sandy beach-lines with abundant alluvial deposits from the numerous rivers draining the southern part of Talesh highlands. They do not reach directly the sea, but converge into the lagoon of Anzali with a single outlet to the Caspian through the dune-covered sandy coastline. The lagoon is constantly getting smaller and shallower under the effect of silting. On the contrary, the streams of northern Talesh and eastern Gilan, even the more abundant Polrud, do not bring alluvium enough to counterbalance the action of a coastal current going eastward, and thus could not build more than a narrow ribbon of lowlands, only a few kilometers wide between Astara and Safid-rud and to the east of Qasemabad, and some 10 km wide at the mouth of the Polrud around kelachay. Climate and weather The topographic position of the Caspian lowlands results in a very characteristic Hyrcanian climate, and the whole province of Gilan belongs to this exceptionally humid and green area. Prevailing north-south atmospheric currents, humidified over the Caspian, are forced to a vigorous ascendancy by the mighty barrier of Alborz and thus pour all around the year abundant rainfall on both the plain and the north-western slope of the mountains. The precipitation regime shows a sharp maximum in autumn (September to December), when atmospheric instability is at its highest point, medium values in winter and early spring, and lowest values from May to August. Mean annual rainfall varies between 1200 and 1800 mm along the shoreline, decreases towards a sub-humid area in the south-western corner of the, and reaches again very high amounts in the lower part of the mountain, up to 1500‚Äì1800 m. Along the Safid-rud valley, swept every afternoon in summer by the violent northerly Manjil wind (Tholozan), a very rapid transition leads to the Mediterranean-like semi-arid area of Rudbar and Manjil. The climatic privilege of Gilan explains its luxuriant natural vegetation. According to altitude, three forest levels can be distinguished: the Hyrcanian mixed forests, the mountain beech forest, and the High Mountain oak and hornbeam forest. The Hyrcanian forest stricto sensu once covered the plains, where only residual patches remain on coarse alluvial terraces between cultivated areas, and still covers the greater part of the first slopes of the mountains up to about 1000 m. It is a stratified forest, with a layer of very tall trees such as the endemic chestnut-leaved oak (boland-mazu; Quercus castaneaefolia), Siberian elm (derakht-e-azad; Zelkova crenata) and iron tree (anjili; Parrotia persica) and more common elms, maples, and hornbeams (ulas); a layer of smaller trees like the endemic Gleditchia caspica (lilaki), Diospyros lotus (kalhu), and Albizzia julibrissin (shabkhosb), boxwood (shemshad) in shady spots and all kinds of wild fruit trees; and an underwood with evergreen bushes such as Prunus laurocerasus (jal) and holly (khas), moss, wild vine, ivy, and other creeping plants. Medium altitude mountains are the realm of the lofty oriental beech (rash; Fagus orientalis), associated with oaks (balut), lime-trees (namdar), maples (afra), and elms (narvan; qq.v.). The upper mountain level, between 1800 and 2200 m, has remnants of a quite poorer forest of stunted oaks (uri; Quercus macranthera) and hornbeams (Carpinus orientalis). Alpine meadows, climactic at higher altitudes, have often replaced these upper mountain forests, some of them, on highest ridges or sheltered slopes, show distinctly xerophytic features. The so-called Mediterranean island around Rudbar and Manjil is conspicuous through its specific vegetation, natural as well as cultivated, i.e., its very sparse cypress (q.v.) forests and its olive-groves. The weather system in Lahijan is more favorable than the other points in the Gilan. It has warmer winters and cooler summers. Freezing temperatures are seldom reported in the coastal areas; however it is not odd for Lahijan to experience periods of near blizzard conditions during the winter. The amount of rainfall in Lahijan depends on the winds bearing vapor that blow from the North West in winter, from the East in spring and from the West in summer and autumn. These winds carry the vapor and humidity towards the plains causing heavy and prolonged rainfalls. Tea Tea in Iran The real colour of the Tea Tea plant. The history of tea culture in Iran started at the end of the 15th century. Before that coffee was the main beverage in Iran. However, most of the coffee producing countries were located far from Iran, making shipping very difficult. With a major tea producing country, China, located on a nearby trading path, \\"the silk road\\", and the shipping of tea was much easier. That was a main reason why tea became much popular in Iran. As a result, the demand for tea grew, and more tea needed to be imported to match Iran's consumption. Iran failed in their first attempt to cultivate tea in their own country in 1882 with seeds from India. In 1899 Prince Mohammad Mirza known as \\"Kashef Al Saltaneh\\" who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was their biggest business in India at the time. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French laborer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to Iran to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra. He started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region. Kashef's mausoleum in Lahijan is now part of the \\"Iran's National Tea Museum\\". Kashef Osaltane's tomb. In 1934 the first modern style tea factory was built. Now there are up to 107 tea factories and a total of 32,000 hectare of tea farms. Most of the farms are located the hillsides of Iran like the farms in Darjeeling. These farms produce an orthodox style of black tea. The color of Iranian tea is red and taste is fairly light, and it is delicious without adding any milk or sugar. The total production of black tea in 2009 was approximately 60‚Äô000 tons. Tea in Lahijan A statue in Lahijan Historically, Lahijan is the first town in Iran to have tea plantations. With its mild weather, soil quality and fresh spring water, Lahijan stands to have the largest area of tea cultivation in Iran. But today the country's tea industry is deep in trouble and the verdant gardens that once sustained millions of farmers and their workers are used only for grazing sheep and other personal purposes. Despite having one of the world's most avid tea drinking populations, the Iranian tea economy is reeling from an influx of foreign imports and smugglers who, local traders complain, often have close family ties to powerful figures in the Islamic government. The consequences are plain to see. In Lahijan, the historic capital of Iran's tea industry, land that was once a lush vista of tea bushes is now occupied by houses and flats, built by tea factory owners who have moved into the building trade in response to their industry's decline. Several of the town's tea mills are derelict. Others are at a stand-still or operating at half capacity. Some 40% of the half-million tea farmers in tea-rich Gilan province have gone out of business, because the factories are no longer buying their crops. Hundreds of thousands of pickers have been forced out of work. Cookies (Kulucheh) Lahijan's cookies (Kulucheh) are well-known and sold all across the world. Culucheh is a traditional Persian-style filled cookie. It has a shell that encrusts a soft filling. The filling comes in different variety of flavors like cocoa, walnut, or coconut. For centuries, using traditional methods, these types of cookies have been produced in Gilan. Noosheen, Grand naderi, Naderi, Nadi and Peyman brands are four famous cookie producers in Lahijan.

This apparently replaces the dangerous stone beating. Karb is normally played in groups through special rhythm and is popular in Aran, Kashan, some districts in Semnan as well as Sabzevar and Lahijan. Stone (karb) beating is symbolic rite which is popular in several parts of the country accompanied by special melodies. Normally two pieces of stone are beaten on the sides of the mourner by special manners and movements accompanied by lamentation song. Apparently as a result of the physical damage caused by stones on the body, wood stick is gradually replacing stone. Lately instead of stone beating other terms such as Karbzani or Karebzani, playing cymbals and ratchets are used. In Mazandaran and some other regions like Komesh, south of Alborz mountain, the term Kareb and in Gilan the term Karb and in Aran (Kashan), cymbal is customary. This ceremony needs considerable physical strength by the performers and is popular in Lahijan and Aran, a district in Kashan, as well as Semnan and Sabzevar. karna nawazi: Karna (trumpet or horn) At certain villages in Gilan such as Mashk, Lasht, and Rudbeneh in Lahijan long Karnas (trumpets or horns) are used in Ashura ceremony. The main body of the trumpet or horn is made of reed at the end of which it has a bend like a staff made of squash. It has a wooden mouthpiece at the other end of the trumpet to blow into the pipe. This special trumpet is used both in passion play and other Ashurayi ceremonies and is called martyrdom song. At certain rituals one of the two singers and a group of Karna players play alternately.

This 16.5 mile line runs from Grafton to Milford and connects to CSX Transportation lines at both ends. Following a period of decline and neglect, maintenance and repairs began in 2008 with the aim of returning the line to operable condition. History The Grafton Centre Railroad was chartered October 22, 1873 and opened August 20, 1874 as a narrow gaugeSixth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners, January, 1875, p. 53 connection from Grafton to a junction with the Boston and Albany Railroad at North Grafton. The last narrow gauge train ran on July 9, 1887. The line was converted to on September 1, 1887. On February 17, 1888, the name was changed to the Grafton and Upton Railroad by an act of the state legislature. An extension to West Upton opened on March 12, 1889, and an extension to Milford opened on May 17, 1890, connecting to the Milford and Woonsocket Railroad, later a line of the New Haven Railroad. The Upton Street Railway was absorbed in 1902 and named the 'Electric Loop' or 'Upton Loop'. Passenger service on this loop and the main line was provided by cars leased from the Milford and Uxbridge Street Railway. In November 1894 William F. Draper of the Draper Company was appointed to the Board of Directors. The Draper Company eventually purchased the G&U; and operated it as a subsidiary. Electric operations typically took place during the daytime, while steam locomotives used the tracks during the nighttime hours. The G&U; ceased passenger service on August 31, 1928. U.S. Mail service along with Railway Express service ceased in 1952. Electric operations ceased on July 3, 1946 and the railroad dieselized during the 1950s. It was at this time that the whole line was upgraded to a heavier grade of track, the first overhaul since the narrow gauge was replaced in 1887. The Draper Company sold the G&U; in 1967 to Rockwell International. Rockwell sold the G&U; to a trucking company, Torco, Inc. of Worcester on January 29, 1979. Traffic has fluctuated over the years of Torco ownership. The last train to Hopedale was in 1988 and for the next 5 years activity was localized solely to the Grafton yard. In 1993 the G&U; bought their current engine, the St. Louis Union Station 212 and began hauling salt to Upton once again. This activity lasted until the late 90s. Torco, Inc. eventually sold the G&U; to the Lucy Family. In 2008 the G&U; passed hands once again to Jon Delli Priscoli. Delli Priscoli has made clear his intentions to revitalize the railroad in its entirety from Grafton to Milford, and work began in earnest in early 2008. 2000s renovation In 2004 a test run was made on the track from North Grafton to West Upton. The track was determined to be in usable condition, however track beyond this point was so deteriorated that it would have been dangerous to operate a train. In March 2008, 50% of the largely dormant G&U; was sold, with the option to purchase the rest. Some in the town of Upton opposed any re-opening or increased use of the railroad line but were unable to have any influence. \\"We can't stop the railroad,\\" said Selectmen Chairwoman Marsha Paul, \\"It is going to open. It will be about two years. It's something we'll have to monitor and watch.\\" The new owner, Delli Priscoli, claims that \\"Railroads are coming back.\\" In October 2008 the North Grafton depot was expanded to accommodate two cars instead of one. On December 31, 2009, a test run was conducted, and it was announced that the portion of the line from North Grafton to West Upton was operable. This is the largest rehabilitation the line has seen since the 1950s. An article in the Milford Daily News dated September 11, 2012, stated: \\"State and local officials drove a ceremonial spike into a South Main Street railroad crossing Monday, signifying the start of reconstruction of the Milford and Hopedale portion of the Grafton and Upton Railroad... Work on the Milford and Hopedale stretch is part of the second phase of getting the railroad back in shape... The first phase of the work was the stretch of track from Grafton to West Upton... [Railroad spokesman Doug Pizzi ] said that he expects crossing construction in Milford will begin within the next month and hopes the entire track will be completed by the end of the year.\\" http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x1803413865/Grafton-and-Upton-Railroad- expansion-officially-under-way?img=2 As of March 2018, the following is complete: * The Milford yard has been completely cleared of trees. * The Hopedale yard has been completely cleared. The old engine house, scale, freight depot, and most of the yard's track have been removed. * The line from North Grafton to Mendon Street in Hopedale has been completely rebuilt. Improvements include new tracks, new ties, relayed stone ballast and extensive ditch work. * The West Upton yard had its switches and track refurbished with fresh ties and new stone ballast. Two new spurs were also built. * The remaining old crossing signals at Upton Street in Grafton, Mendon Street and Greene Street in Hopedale, and South Main Street in Milford have been removed. * The propane facility in North Grafton has been completed. * New grade crossings along the entire line have been installed, including through Hopedale and Milford. * New crossing signals have been installed at North Street, Jordan Boulevard, and Upton Street in Grafton. Signals in Upton at Williams Street, Hartford Avenue, Maple Avenue, and Pleasant Street have also been installed. MBTA Proposals In July 2011, the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization started studies into extending Franklin Line service from Forge Park/495 into Milford and Hopedale. This study would be the first study into this since a former study in 1997, which concluded that the extension was not high-priority. The study looked into a station in Hopedale, near the privately owned Draper Mill, and infill stations in Milford and Bellingham. A second Milford station was proposed in a 2003 plan for the town near the intersections of Depot and Central Street, but it lies on a spur off of the tracks. Although the study was completed, the extension was put on hold for the near future.http://www.milforddailynews.com/x920808681/Franklin- rail-line-could-expand-to-Milford-and- Hopedalehttps://web.archive.org/web/20120220063110/http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/pmt- old/PMT-4.pdf Locomotive fleet Until 2017, the Grafton and Upton operated a fleet of various EMD locomotives, including GP7s, GP9s, CF7s, and an F7. These were replaced by one leased and three purchased MP15AC locomotives in 2017 and 2018.

The Lickey Hills Country Park is 2.5 miles (4 km) to the northwest. It is south of Birmingham, north of Redditch and east of Bromsgrove. At the 2001 Census, the population was 5,316.Census 2001 History Alvechurch means \\"√Ülfgyth's church\\". In the eighth century, √Ülfgyth founded a church on the site of the church of St. Laurence. King Offa of Mercia gave the land forming the parish to Bishops of Worcester in 780. The parish is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1068 as \\"Alvievecherche\\" with a small population of under 20 people. In the 13th Century the Bishop of Worcester built a palace in the village, and a weekly market and an annual fair were established. The Bishop's Palace was pulled down in the 17th century, the only remnants being part of the moat and a yew tree which formerly stood in the palace grounds. From the 19th century to the mid-twentieth century there was a brick factory in the hamlet of Withybed on the edge of the village. Other local industries included nail and needle making. Dellow cars were made in Alvechurch between 1949 and 1956. Architecture The village has a number of medieval half-timbered buildings, as well as many Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian buildings. The church of St Laurence dates back to 1239. It is situated on high ground, and was probably the site of an earlier Mercian church, although nothing remains of the earlier wooden building. Much of the church was rebuilt between 1858 and 1861 by William Butterfield. There is a 1,348-pipe organ. The tower has a peal of eight bells, rung regularly by the North Worcestershire and District Change Ringing Association. The Ark, a ¬£1m extension to the church was built in 2005 despite a village referendum in February 2004 voting against the erection of the building. There are also many newer residential buildings and a First and Middle school with library. In 2008 a new first and middle school were built north-east of the village, the old school has since sadly been demolished and the new estate has road names commemorating the house names of the school. Arts and entertainment There is an attractive arts and crafts style Baptist church in the centre of the village. There is also a renowned local amateur dramatic group, the Alvechurch Drama Society which produces two plays per year at the village hall. The group is celebrated for its original pantomimes which are written by Chris Davies and Paul Chamberlain. Alvechurch Sports and Social Club hosts live music on a regular basis and is home to Alvechurch Acoustic Roots a curated music event which welcomes performers from the local area and beyond.  Sport  The football team that serves the village is Alvechurch FC, which was founded in 1929 and played in the local park prior to a move to Lye Meadow. They reached the Third Round of the FA Cup in 1973, losing 4-2 to Bradford City, the club was at its greatest in the 80's when it spent a large stint in the Southern League Premier. In November 1993 they folded, but a group of supporters resurrected the club in 1994, in season 2002-03 the club gained promotion to the Midland Football Alliance, now known as the Midland Football League Premier, and won the division in the 2016-17 season. In the 2017-18 season, they finished 2nd in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League Division 1 South, gaining promotion to the 3rd tier of the non league pyramid. As of the 2018-19 season they play in the Evo-Stik Southern Football League Central Premier. The village also has a local cricket team. Travel and transport The M42 motorway runs across the north side of the village; the nearest junction is north of the village at Hopwood, junction 2. Alvechurch railway station, opened in 1859, is on the Cross-City Line. It provides local trains to Redditch and Lichfield via Birmingham. The station is unmanned. On 1 September 2014, a passing loop and second platform were completed and officially opened. The village is accessible by narrowboat along a rural canal. Alvechurch Marina is on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal (built 1789), just across a hedgerow from the station. The A441 road used to pass through the village, but now a relief road by-passes the village, helping to reduce traffic and pollution. Recently, specific traffic-calming measures have been added to the village's main thoroughfares. These 'pinch-points' reduce the road width to one raised central lane, preventing drivers from speeding and promoting considerate road use. Alvechurch F.C. play their home games at Lye Meadow on Redditch Road.

It was created in 2014. \\"Orsan\\" stands for , i.e. \\"organisation of the healthcare response system in exceptional public health situations\\". It is a nationwide emergency plan that is the frame for the white plans (, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) that are locally developed for hospitals.  Sections  The Orsan plan has five sections: * ORSAN AMAVI: massive number of non-contaminated casualties (); * ORSAN CLIM: massive number of patients due to a climate event e.g. heat wave or cold wave (); * ORSAN EPI-VAC: nationwide epidemic, with eventually vaccination campaign (); * ORSAN BIO: known or emerging biological risk (); * ORSAN NRC: nuclear, radiological or chemical event (). The Orsan plan was activated for the first time for the seasonal influenza epidemic during winter 2014‚Äì2015 and a second time during the November 2015 Paris attacks. See: References  White Plans  The French disaster white plans are the new trend for the SAMU national network and integrated EMS (IEMS) towards a modern medical sanitary civil defence. These sanitary disaster plans are mandatory and implemented by each public health agency, public or private, by a person chosen by the institution. The plan is submitted to the consultative and deliberative authorities of the institution (board of directors, medical committee, technical committee, hygiene, security and working conditions committee) and by regional public health authorities. The scheme of the white plans for the ' is made by the director of public health ('), with the technical collaboration of the SAMU (French emergency medical service) and the regional public health authority. public health white plans are integrated with comprehensive disaster plans (Orsec plan). It is initiated by the medical regulator doctor decision of the SAMU who alerts public health authority for extension. SAMU sends on the first line of the site a SAMU command post and an advanced medical post for prehospital medical triaging. The SAMU implements a specific extension of its daily medical regulation task. Neighbouring SAMU and even national SAMU network and the Public Health Ministry are connected with the local organisation and bring assistance to the local organisation. White plans can be initiated in a local prehospital, hospital site or air evacuation site or at regional or higher levels. The actions performed by the white plans include: * a crisis management cell at each level () is set up * the care professional teams are maintained on duty (especially when the crisis happens at the shift change) * the off-duty personnel are gradually called back, in order to have sufficient means, but keeping a reserve to take over if the crisis lasts; * the transfer of patients from the strongly involved services to less involved services, and possibly to other less involved health institutions or even to home under SAMU regulation aid. * the non-emergency operations are cancelled from the schedule; * the available means are listed by the medical-technical services (pharmacy, laboratories, medical imaging) and the logistics services (laundry, catering); * the switchboard is strengthened, the communications are exclusively reserved for the white plan; * if necessary, the hospital is strengthened by a mobile sanitary kit (', PSM); * in case of massive arrival at the emergency department, a strict triage is organised at the entrance of the hospital under the charge of a sorting physician; it is performed in a big room that is different from the usual emergency entrance and from the reception for the relatives and the press; * a reception for the relatives and for the press is organised; the priests of the different religions are requested to help the relatives (morale); * the traffic on the site is organised, to allow emergency transfers and efficient use of evacuation convoys.

Early life and career Vulliamy was born and raised in Notting Hill, London. His mother is the children's author and illustrator Shirley Hughes, his father was the architect John Sebastian Vulliamy, of the Vulliamy family, and his grandfathers were the Liverpool store owner Thomas Hughes and the author C. E. Vulliamy. He was educated at the independent University College School and at Hertford College, Oxford, where he won an Open Scholarship, wrote a thesis on the Northern Ireland \\"Troubles\\" and graduated in Politics and Philosophy. In 1979, he joined Granada Television's current affairs programme World in Action, and in 1985 won a Royal Television Society (RTS) Award for a film about Ireland. In 1986, he joined The Guardian as a reporter, later Rome correspondent covering the Mafia and Southern Europe. From there, he covered the Balkan wars, revealing a gulag of concentration camps. In August 1992 Vulliamy and British television reporter Penny Marshall managed to gain access to the notorious Omarska and Trnopolje camps, operated by the Bosnian Serbs for mainly Bosnian Muslim and Croat Catholic inmates. Their graphic accounts of the conditions of the prisoners were recorded for the documentary Omarska's survivors: Bosnia 1992.http://aje.io/avkd Discovery of the camps was credited with contributing to the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. He remained in Bosnia for the bulk of the remainder of the war, covering 'ethnic cleansing' from the inside, and the siege of Sarajevo. For his coverage of the war in Bosnia, Vulliamy won most major awards in British journalism and became the first journalist since the Nuremberg trials to testify at an international war crimes tribunal, the ICTY. He testified for the prosecution in ten trials at the ICTY, including those of Bosnian Serb leaders Dr. Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and General Ratko Mladiƒá. In 1991, Vulliamy also covered the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, in Iraq, revealing atrocities by Saddam Hussein's troops in the Shiite South. In 1994-5, and again from 1997 to 2003, Vulliamy was based in Washington and later New York as U.S. Correspondent for The Guardian's sister paper, The Observer. In the United States, he covered the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, and in its wake, investigated deep within the far-right militia movement. He covered US politics, society, culture and sports across the union, the transition from the presidency of Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. Later, he reported on the lynching of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and on its slipstream, penetrated the white supremacist backstory behind the killer's world, in jail and among fringe religious compounds. He was living in New York at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and covered the story and its aftermath, in the city and along the corridors of power. While based in New York, he reported from Mexico on narco-traffic, organised crime and the mass-murder of women in Ciudad Ju√°rez; from Haiti on the regime of Raoul Cedras and US intervention 1994 US intervention , from Jamaica on organised crime in Jamaica, from Cuba on the dissident movement and from Nicaragua. Vulliamy closely covered the lead-up to the invasion of, and war in, Iraq from 2002 onwards. He clashed with his newspaper, The Observer, over its support for the invasion, often unable to place his stories about false intelligence and non-existence of weapons of mass destruction in the paper (see Official Secrets film below, 2019). He reported from Iraq several times from early 2003 to 2005, on civilian casualties of the invasion, and on the subsequent insurgency. From 2003 onwards, Vulliamy has worked along the US-Mexican border, reporting on organised crime, narco-traffic, cartel wars, security and migration. This work led to his book Amexica: War Along the Borderline, which in 2013 won the coveted Ryszard Kapuscinski Award for Literary Reportage ‚Äì named in honour of the writer, creator and master of the genre. He was among the first reporters to reveal the laundering of proceeds of naro-traffic by mainstream high-street banks (Wachovia and HSBC) on a massive scale. His book The War is Dead, Long Live The War about the survivors of Bosnia's rape and concentration camps was shortlisted for the same Ryszard Kapuscinski prize in 2015. Vulliamy badly broke his leg in 2013, and wrote a detailed article from the patient's viewpoint about his prolonged treatment with the Ilizarov apparatus, an external frame that stretches the leg. As a result of the accident, he left the staff of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers in October 2016, after 31 years, to become a full-time author, journalist and film-researcher - but continues to work regularly as a reporter for The Guardian, The Observer and Guardian Films on narco-traffic, the US-Mexico border and the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC. Vulliamy also writes about football, music and painting. In 2014, he completed a book for Granta about Diego Vel√°zquez's painting Las Meninas, Everything Is Happening: Journey Into A Painting, for Vulliamy's friend Michael Jacobs, who died suddenly of cancer before it was finished. In 2018 he published a memoir through music, When Words Fail: A Life with Music, War and Peace, also for Granta, to be published in the United States as 'Louder Than Bombs' by the University of Chicago Press. The book explores music and conflict, and features the last interview with B.B. King. Vulliamy sings in an occasional blues/rock band, Age Against the Machine. Current and forthcoming books and journalism for The Guardian returns to Mexico, narco-traffic and organised crime. In 2019, Vulliamy was played the actor Rhys Ifans in Gavin Hood's acclaimed Hollywood film Official Secrets about the case of Katharine Gun, a GCHQ agent who blew the whistle on illegal bugging of UN diplomats during the lead-up to the Iraq invasion of 2003, with Keira Knightley in the lead role. Vulliamy features in the film furious at censorship by his own paper of a story he filed during October- December 2002 from an inside CIA source, Mel Goodman, affirming that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, while intelligence was being 'cooked' by a special office in the Pentagon - and then locating the NSA secret agent, Frank Koza, who ordered the illegal bugging. Vulliamy has called Ifans' performance \\"my Alter Idem, more me than I am!\\". In 2020, Vulliamy was made an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths' College, University of London. Accepting the fellowship, he called in \\"one of the great honours of my life\\", and urged media and journalism students to \\"get out there and give them hell\\". Awards Vulliamy was awarded most major prizes in British journalism for his coverage of the war in Bosnia and work on organised crime. Among his awards for newspaper reporting are: Granada Television's What The Papers Say Foreign Correspondent of the Year', 1992; British Press Awards International Reporter of the Year, 1992 and 1997; Amnesty International Media award 1992; and the James Cameron Award in 1994. In January 2020, Ed gave an inspirational Acceptance address to Graduates of Goldsmiths College, London, on receiving an Honorary Doctorate. He expressed his wish to be an active Alumni to a most appreciative audience.

The operation aimed to release five British soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment and their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer, who were being held by a militia group known as the \\"West Side Boys\\". The soldiers were part of a patrol that was returning from a visit to Jordanian peacekeepers attached to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) at Masiaka on 25 August 2000 when they turned off the main road and down a track towards the village of Magbeni. There the patrol of twelve men was overwhelmed by a large number of heavily armed rebels, taken prisoner, and transported to Gberi Bana on the opposite side of Rokel Creek. The British Army negotiated the release of six men, but were unable to gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September. The ground operation was conducted by D Squadron, 22 Regiment Special Air Service‚Äîwho assaulted Gberi Bana in a bid to extract the Royal Irish‚Äîand elements of 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), who launched a diversionary assault on Magbeni. The operation freed the five soldiers as well as twenty-one Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held prisoner by the West Side Boys. At least twenty- five West Side Boys were killed in the assault, as was one British soldier, while eighteen West Side Boys‚Äîincluding the gang's leader, Foday Kallay‚Äîwere taken prisoner and later transferred to the custody of the Sierra Leone Police. Many West Side Boys fled the area during the assault, and over 300 surrendered to UNAMSIL forces within a fortnight. The operation restored confidence in the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the United Nations Security Council, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced the creation of the Special Forces Support Group‚Äîa permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. Background Sierra Leone is a former British colony in West Africa, close to the equator, with an area of ‚Äîsimilar in size to South Carolina or Scotland. By 2000, the country had been consumed by a civil war which had begun in 1991. The West Side Boys were a militia group who had been involved in the civil war. They were initially loyal to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the rebel army opposing the government; they later fought for the government, against the RUF, and were involved in at least one operation directed by British officers in exchange for weapons and medical supplies.Fowler, 2004, p. 110. But the West Side Boys refused to integrate into the reconstituted Sierra Leone Army and began operating as bandits from the abandoned villages of Magbeni and Gberi Bana, on opposite sides of Rokel Creek.Fowler, 2010, pp. 7‚Äì9. British forces were deployed to Sierra Leone in May 2000, initially for a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Palliser, in which they were tasked with evacuating foreign nationals‚Äîparticularly those from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, and others for whom the British government had accepted consular responsibility. As part of the mission, British forces secured Sierra Leone's main airport, Lungi. Having secured Freetown and Lungi, and evacuated the foreign nationals who wished to leave, the initial forces left and were replaced by a \\"Short Term Training Team\\" (STTT), whose mission was to train and rebuild the Sierra Leone Army. The STTT was initially formed from a detachment from 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment, who were replaced in July 2000 by 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment (1 R IRISH). The Special Air Service (SAS) is a corps of the British Army and part of the United Kingdom's special forces. It consists of three regiments, of which two are drawn from the Territorial Army and one regular regiment‚Äî22 Regiment, which was involved in Operation Barras. The SAS was formed by Colonel David Stirling in Africa in 1941, at the height of the Second World War's North African Campaign. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams‚Äîhaving realised that small, well-trained teams could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers. The SAS first entered the public eye after Operation Nimrod, the operation to end the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980.Fremont-Barnes, pp. 6‚Äì7. The 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) is part of the British Army's infantry and, as in the SAS, applicants must undergo an additional level of scrutiny in order to be accepted. Unlike in the SAS, new recruits to the army can apply to join the Parachute Regiment directly from the Infantry Training Centre at Catterick in Yorkshire (in the case of soldiers) or the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (for officers). The regiment, whose personnel are commonly known as \\"paras\\", specialises in parachute and other types of airborne insertion, and has close ties to the SAS, providing more of its personnel than any other regiment.Fowler, 2010, p. 24. Capture of the Royal Irish patrol Weapons Mount Installation Kit (\\"Wimik\\"), similar to the vehicles used by the Royal Irish patrol, this one in service with the RAF Regimentalt=Desert-coloured Land Rover with mounted machine gun On 25 August 2000, a patrol led by Major Allan Marshall consisting of 11 men from the 1 R IRISH and an official from the Sierra Leone Army acting as interpreter, Lieutenant Musa Bangura, left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers attached to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and Marshall decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base.Fowler, 2010, pp. 10‚Äì12. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track that led to the village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He and the rest of the patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creek and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the other side of the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation. British forces in Sierra Leone were operating on the authority of the Sierra Leone government, but President Ahmad Kabbah allowed British forces to negotiate for the soldiers' release themselves, as his government lacked the requisite expertise. The negotiations were led by Lieutenant Colonel Simon Fordham, commanding officer of 1 R IRISH, who was assisted by a small team which included hostage negotiators from the Metropolitan Police.Dorman, p. 106. The West Side Boys would not allow negotiators any closer to the village of Magbeni than the end of the track from the main road, so Fordham met there with the self-styled \\"Brigadier\\" Foday Kallay, the gang's leader, to negotiate for the soldiers' release. On 29 August, Fordham demanded proof that the captive soldiers were still alive, and Kallay brought with him to that day's meeting the two officers from the group‚ÄîMarshall, the company commander, and Captain Flaherty, the regimental signals officer. During the meeting, Flaherty shook hands with Fordham and covertly passed him a sketch map of Gberi Bana which detailed the layout of the village and the building in which the soldiers were being held.Fowler, 2010, pp. 13‚Äì16. Two days later, on 31 August, five of the eleven hostages were released in exchange for a satellite telephone and medical supplies.Connaughton, p. 111. The OC of the captured soldiers had originally decided to release the youngest first, but this was changed to the married men last minute. However, out of the married men the West Side Boys wanted two of them to remain due to their signals experience. The released soldiers included the Sergeant Major, two corporals and two rangers. The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the remaining captured soldiers which included the OC, a Captain, a Sergeant, a Lance Corporal and two Rangers that they would not be released until the gang's remaining demands were met. The released soldiers were flown for debriefing to RFA Sir Percivale, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, off the coast. After the release of the soldiers, the West Side Boys' spokesman, the self- styled \\"Colonel Cambodia\\", used the satellite telephone to contact the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for a lengthy interview in which they outlined a series of demands, including a re-negotiation of the Lom√© Peace Accord and the release of prisoners held by the Sierra Leone authorities. The BBC had prior warning from the Foreign Office that the interview would take place. \\"Colonel Cambodia\\" quickly depleted the batteries in the telephone, but his call to the BBC enabled specialists from the Royal Corps of Signals to determine the exact position of the telephone. Deterioration The West Side Boys were unstable, possibly due to use of cannabis and cocaine, and their behaviour during the crisis was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed a problem for the British negotiators as their cannabis use caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful. During the negotiations, the relatives of several of the West Side Boys were brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands‚Äîwhich now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army. Military planning Around the time that the five soldiers were released, two negotiators from the SAS joined Fordham's negotiating team. One of them joined Fordham in several meetings with the West Side Boys, posing as a Royal Irish major in order to provide reconnaissance and gather intelligence in case an assault was required. Shortly after the patrol's capture Surgeon Lieutenant Jon Carty RN, the medical officer on board HMS Argyll‚Äîwhich was operating off the coast‚Äîwas brought ashore to assess the soldiers, should they be freed, or to provide immediate care in the event of an assault resulting in casualties. Argyll also served as a temporary base for two Army Air Corps Lynx attack helicopters from No. 657 Squadron which had been flown to Sierra Leone to support any direct action.Fowler, 2010, pp. 17‚Äì21. David Richards (then a brigadier), was commander of British forces in Sierra Leone in 2000.alt=An officer in warm-weather uniform As planning for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed, it became clear that, given the number of West Side Boys and their separation between two locations (Gberi Bana as well as the village of Magbeni; see below), the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone.Dorman, p. 108. Thus, the headquarters of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group, which would support special forces if such an operation was launched. The battalion's commanding officer selected A Company, led by Major Matthew Lowe, which had been on exercise in Jamaica at the time of the initial British deployment to Sierra Leone. Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior. Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company, but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the company group up to the required strength, including a signals group, snipers, heavy machine gun sections, and a mortar section.Fowler, 2010, pp. 21‚Äì27.Fowler, 2004, p. 115. The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners, given that the West Side Boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties.Dorman, p. 109. On 31 August, the company group was ordered to move to South Cerney in Gloucestershire, under the cover story that they were conducting a \\"readiness to move\\" exercise. It was only at this point, and after all mobile telephones had been confiscated to ensure operational security, that the entire company was briefed on the operation that was being planned. With the operation becoming more likely to be launched, Lowe and his planning group flew to Dakar, Senegal, on 3 September to continue planning and to study intelligence gathered from SAS patrols operating near the West Side Boys' camp. The British government feared that deployment of forces to Sierra Leone might precipitate an adverse reaction by the West Side Boys against the captive soldiers. They calculated that it would take 14 hours to launch an assault from the United Kingdom should it be required in an emergency, so the remainder of the company group was also moved to Dakar in order to reduce the response time.Fowler, 2004, p. 123. In order to further reduce the response time, political authority to launch the assault in an emergency was delegated to the British High Commissioner in Freetown, Alan Jones, while the military decision was delegated to Brigadier David Richards, commander of British forces in Sierra Leone. Two days later, a pair of SAS observation teams (one on each side of Rokel Creek) were inserted near the villages by assault boats manned by the Special Boat Service (SBS)‚Äîthe Royal Navy's special forces unit. They began monitoring the West Side Boys' movements and gathering intelligence, such as details of weapons, as well as identifying viable landing sites for helicopters. With the progression of the plans, the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for an assault on the village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.Dorman, p. 113. Several methods of insertion were considered, both for the paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, largely due to the West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.Fowler, 2010, pp. 26‚Äì29. Deployment to Sierra Leone By 5 September, the British media was openly speculating on the possibility that an operation would be launched to free the remaining soldiers, having picked up on 1 PARA's heightened readiness. The following day, the media was reporting that British forces had arrived in Sierra Leone \\"as a contingency\\". The British special forces kept a low profile, as was traditional, and the media interest surrounding 1 PARA allowed D Squadron, 22 SAS to enter Sierra Leone unnoticed.Fowler, 2010, p. 28. The enhanced A Company group‚Äîapproximately 130 troops in total‚Äîarrived in the country in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in Hastings, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp.Connaughton, p. 112. As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion‚Äîexcluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of heat exhaustion, but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.Fowler, 2010, pp. 29‚Äì30. A day after the arrival of the paras, Director Special Forces (DSF), Brigadier John Holmes, arrived in Freetown with a headquarters staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron, as well as three personnel from the Royal Air Force's Tactical Communications Wing. Holmes based himself at Seaview House, the British military headquarters in Freetown, near the British High Commission. From there, his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with COBRA, the British government's emergency committee in London.Fowler, 2004, pp. 123‚Äì124Fowler, 2010, p. 31. The DSF, who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces, was represented by his chief of staff and by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces.Fowler, 2004, p. 124.Collins, p. 13. The operation Decision to launch On 9 September, \\"Colonel Cambodia\\" stated that the remaining six members of the Royal Irish patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would be released only after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone. The negotiators concluded that the West Side Boys' increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, the SAS teams near the West Side Boys' base reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers during the four days they had been in position. There were also concerns that the West Side Boys might move further inland, and either kill the soldiers or move them to a location from which it would be more difficult for British forces to extract them. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an assault.Fowler, 2010, pp. 32‚Äì33. The operation was to commence at first light the next day, 10 September. The intervening time was spent securing the political and legal basis for the raid. Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, while the Army Legal Corps secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police. Fordham, who had been leading the negotiations, telephoned the West Side Boys and was able to establish that the captive soldiers were alive, and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September. The two villages were to be assaulted simultaneously‚ÄîGberi Bana, where the Royal Irish were held, by the SAS and Magbeni by the paras. In addition to the remaining Royal Irish soldiers, the SAS were also tasked with extracting Lieutenant Musa Bangura‚Äîthe patrol's SLA liaison, whose extraction was given the same priority as that of the Royal Irish‚Äîand a group of Sierra Leonean civilians who were being held by the West Side Boys.Fowler, 2010, pp. 38‚Äì39. Assault US Marines alt=Marines descending from a helicopter with no equipment other than a rope The task force left Hastings‚Äîapproximately 15 minutes' flying time from the West Side Boys' camp‚Äîat approximately 06:15.Fowler, 2004, p. 137. Downstream from the villages‚Äîapproximately 15 minutes' flying time, just out of the West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys in the vicinity of the captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams. =Gberi Bana= After the first sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana. The troopers fast-roped into the village and immediately came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty‚Äîa round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.Fowler, 2010, pp. 42‚Äì43. The SAS located the captive British soldiers from the latter's shouts of \\"British Army, British Army!\\", though Bangura had been held separately and proved more difficult to locate. He was found in a squalid open pit, which had been used by the West Side Boys as a lavatory,Fowler, 2010, p. 52. and had been starved and beaten during his captivity, and thus had to be carried to the helicopter. Less than 20 minutes after the arrival of the SAS, the remaining members of the Royal Irish patrol, including Bangura, had been evacuated from the area. As the SAS operation concluded, the Chinooks ferried prisoners and bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would be identified and buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be handed over to the Sierra Leonean Police.Fowler, 2010, p. 54.Fowler, 2004, p. 128. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys‚Äîthe men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault. =Magbeni= alt=A vehicle being carried underneath a helicopter The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.Fowler, 2010, p. 43. The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion‚Äîpossibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group‚Äîinjured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.Fowler, 2010, pp. 46‚Äì47. The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Under his command, each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on the replica village at Hastings. The West Side Boys' ammunition store was found and secured and, once the rest of the buildings had been cleared, the paras took up defensive positions to block any potential counter-attack and patrols went into the immediate jungle in search of any West Side Boys hiding in the bushes. The village was completely secure by 08:00 and the paras secured the approaches with Claymore mines and mortars positioned to prevent a counter-attack, while a detachment destroyed the remaining vehicles and heavy weapons including the Bedford lorry which had blocked the Royal Irish patrol. The paras also recovered the Royal Irish patrol's Land Rovers, which were slung under the Chinooks and removed. The last British soldiers left the area at approximately 14:00.Fowler, 2010, pp. 50‚Äì54. =Conclusion of the assault= The remaining members of the captured patrol were flown to RFA Sir Percivale. Fordham visited the men shortly after the operation and stated \\"they looked remarkably well considering the ordeal they had been through\\" and described them as being \\"physically and mentally exhausted\\". After medical checks, the soldiers, who had been held for 17 days, were allowed to telephone their families and then rejoined their battalion in Freetown. The paras were flown to RFA Argus where they spent the night before being flown back to the United Kingdom the next day. D Squadron, 22 SAS also left Sierra Leone the day after the operation, along with Director Special Forces and his headquarters staff. Aftermath Sir David Frost, who broke the news of Operation Barras to the British publicalt=A grey-haired bespectacled man in a suit One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, was killed in the operation. Another twelve soldiers were injured, one seriously.Fowler, 2010, p. 57. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper. Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle.Fowler, 2010, p. 51. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371‚Äîincluding 57 children‚Äîhad surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were \\"finished as a military threat\\".Connaughton, p. 117. Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL. He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave.Fowler, 2010, p. 55. The morning of the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)‚Äîthe professional head of the British Armed Forces‚Äîwas coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost. The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie's interview with Frost, which took place while the operation was still concluding. Guthrie told Frost \\"[W]e didn't want to have to assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but we have done it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere. The hostages had been there for three weeks, they [the West Side Boys] were threatening to kill them, or they were threatening to move them to other parts of Sierra Leone and once they'd done that we'd never be able to recover [the soldiers] with ease, which I hope we've done this morning\\".Fowler, 2010, pp. 56‚Äì57. The MoD issued a press release with more details later in the day.Fowler, 2010, p. 58. Several decorations were awarded to the personnel who took part in Operation Barras, including two Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses, five Military Crosses (one of which was awarded to Matthews, who took command of the operation in Magbeni after the officer commanding was injured), and five Distinguished Flying Crosses. Holmes (Director Special Forces) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the operation. Tinnion received a posthumous Mention in Despatches.Fowler, 2004, p. 176. Marshall was later transferred to another regiment at his own request, while two of the soldiers on the patrol subsequently left the army and another two transferred to \\"Home Service\\" units (those based permanently in Northern Ireland).Collins, pp. 25‚Äì27. Long-term British impact alt=A photograph of a man with greying hair speaking into a microphone and gesturing with his left hand The capture of the Royal Irish patrol had undermined the confidence of the Sierra Leonean population in the British operation, which they hoped would help to bring an end to the country's civil war, and embarrassed the British government, which had been critical of similar previous incidents involving UNAMSIL personnel. Operation Barras restored confidence in the British forces, prompting military historian William Fowler to call the operation \\"a necessarily spectacular endorsement of the rule of law and the elected government of Sierra Leone\\".Fowler, 2004, p. 158. The British media struck a celebratory note at the success of Operation Barras, but some suggested that Marshall had erred in diverting the patrol off the main road to visit the West Side Boys. Both Marshall and Bangura‚Äîthe patrol's Sierra Leone Army liaison‚Äîwere adamant that the patrol had been asked by the Jordanian peacekeepers serving with UNAMSIL to, in Bangura's words, \\"take a closer look\\". However, the commander of UNAMSIL‚ÄîGeneral Mohamed Garba of Nigeria‚Äîinitially denied that the Royal Irish had met the Jordanians and both UNAMSIL HQ and the Jordanian commanding officer denied that the patrol were asked to investigate the West Side Boys' camp.Fowler, 2010, p. 18.Fowler, 2010, pp. 59‚Äì60. An investigation into the capture of the patrol was launched by Land Command and a senior officer was despatched to Freetown to debrief the members of the patrol. The report was critical of Marshall, stating that he \\"made an error of professional judgement in diverting from a planned and authorised journey to make an unauthorised visit to the village of Magbeni.\\" The risks of Operation Barras were acknowledged by the MoD and by officers involved in the planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as \\"not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong\\". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse to the possibility of casualties where they felt the cause was just.Connaughton, p. 116. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that \\"[Operation Barras] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [sic] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept the rule of law and the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action\\". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have \\"raised questions\\" regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.Dorman, pp. 113‚Äì114.Dorman, p. 9. The success of Operation Barras was a factor in the decision to form the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion‚Äîoriginally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role‚Äîwith supporting elements from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.Fowler, 2010, p. 61. The capture of the Royal Irish patrol and the effectiveness of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied political pressure through the United Nations Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)‚Äîthe second main party to the civil war after the government‚Äîand on Sierra Leone's neighbour Liberia, which had provided support to the RUF. The new approach, combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.Dorman, pp. 115‚Äì122.Fowler, 2004, p. 177.

His career represented a landmark in Russian history, as he was the first junior noble to attain the boyar title and highest offices of state not as a result of family connections but due to his personal capabilities and achievements. In many things he anticipated Peter the Great.  Early life and career  Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin was the son of a poor official from Pskov, who saw to it that his son was taught Latin, German and mathematics. Ordin-Nashchokin began his public career in 1642 as one of the officials involved in determining the new Russo-Swedish frontier after the peace of Stolbovo. By that time, he had gained a reputation in Russia as having a thorough understanding of \\"German ways and things\\". He was one of the first Muscovites who diligently collected foreign books; it was said that as many as sixty-nine Latin works were sent to him at one time from abroad. This cites: *Sergey Solovyov, History of Russia (Rus.), vol. xi. (St Petersburg, 1895, seq.) *V. Ikonnikov, \\"Biography of Orduin-Nashchokin\\" (in Russkaya Starina, Nos. 11-12) (St Petersburg, 1883) *Robert Nisbet Bain, The First Romanovs (London, 1905, chaps. 4 and 6) Ordin-Nashchokin attracted the attention of the young Tsar Alexis because of his resourcefulness during the Pskov rebellion of 1650, which he succeeded in bringing under control through his personal efforts. At the beginning of the Russo-Swedish War (1656‚Äì1658), Ordin was appointed to a high command, in which he displayed strong capabilities.  Diplomatic missions  In 1657 Ordin-Nashchokin was appointed minister plenipotentiary to treat with the Swedes on the Narva River. He was regarded as the only Russian statesman of the day with sufficient foresight to grasp the fact that the Baltic seaboard, or even a part of it, was worth more to Russia than ten times the same amount of territory in Lithuania, and, despite opposition from a number of his colleagues, in December 1658 he succeeded in concluding a three- year Treaty of Valiesari whereby the Russians were left in possession of all their conquests in Livonia. In 1660 Ordin-Nashchokin was sent as plenipotentiary to a second congress, to convert the truce of 1658 into a permanent peace. He advised that the truce with Sweden should be prolonged and Charles II of England was invited to mediate a northern peace. Finally he laid stress upon the importance of Livonia for the development of Russian trade. On being overruled he retired from the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Kardis. Ordin-Nashchokin was the chief plenipotentiary at the abortive congress of Durovicha, which met in 1664, to end the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667). He negotiated the Truce of Niemie≈ºa and it was due in no small measure to his abilities and his tenacity of purpose that Russia succeeded in concluding with Poland the advantageous Truce of Andrusovo (1667). On his return to Russia he was created a boyar of the first class and entrusted with the direction of the Foreign Office, with the title of Guardian of the great Tsarish Seal and Director of the great Imperial Offices. He was, in fact, the first Russian chancellor.  Later life and achievements  Afanasy Ordin- Nashchokin sets a postal system in Russia. The stamp of Russia, 2011 It was Ordin-Nashchokin who first abolished the onerous system of tolls on exports and imports, and brought together Russian merchants with the aim of promoting direct commercial relations between Sweden and Russia. He also initiated a postal system between Russia, Courland and Poland, and introduced gazettes and bills of exchange into Russia. He is also associated with the building of the first Russian merchant-vessels on the Dvina and Volga. During his career Ordin-Nashchokin had to constantly struggle with narrow routine and personal jealousy on the part of many of the boyars and clerks of the council. He was last employed in the negotiations for confirming the truce of Andrusovo (September 1669March 1670). In January 1671 he attended upon the tsar on the occasion of his second marriage; but in February 1671 he was dismissed, and withdrew to the Krypetsky monastery near his native Pskov. There Ordin- Nashchokin took the tonsure under the name of Antony, and occupied himself with charity until his death in 1680. According to an assessment in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"[h]e was absolutely incorruptible, thus standing, morally as well as intellectually, far above the level of his age.\\" References Foreign ministers of the Tsardom of Russia 1605 births 1680 deaths ","title":"Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin"},{"id":"1389927","text":"Chikuma may refer to: * Chikuma, Nagano, a city located in Nagano Prefecture of Japan ** Chikuma Station * Chikuma District, a former district located in the vicinity of the current city of Matsumoto * Chikuma River, the name of the Shinano River as it flows through Nagano Prefecture * Chikuma, Angola, a commune * Chikuma-class cruiser, a class of protected cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy * Japanese ship Chikuma, several warships * Chikuma Shob≈ç, a Japanese publisher ","title":"Chikuma"},{"id":"1389929","text":"Chino or El Chino may refer to: Art, entertainment, and media * Chino (1973 film), an Italian film starring Charles Bronson * Chino (1991 film), a Nepali film Places * Chino, California, a city in San Bernardino County, California, USA * Chino, Nagano, a city in Nagano prefecture, Japan * Chino Hills, a mountain range on the border of Orange, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties, California * Chino Hills, California, a city in San Bernardino County, California, USA * Chino Valley, Arizona, a town in Yavapai County, Arizona, USA ;Structures * California Institution for Men, a prison in Chino, San Bernardino County, California nicknamed \\"Chino\\" Businesses * Chino Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of measuring/controlling instruments and instrumentation systems.

He was a specialist slow left arm orthodox bowler known for his loopy trajectory and ability to spin and bounce, but has found international selection blocked during his prime years by the presence of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. He is also a left-handed batsman, and although he has had some success with the bat at first-class level with 19 half-centuries, he has not been able to repeat this at international level. After starting out in the Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996‚Äì97 and after a few productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer. For the next four years, Kartik was on the fringes of selection. He made his ODI debut in 2002 and had a short stint before being dropped and missing the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of mediocre performance. He was recalled in late-2003 for limited overs matches and played in around half of India's matches for a six-month period, as well as one Test after Harbhajan suffered a serious injury. In late-2004 Kartik played in three Tests as India fielded three spinners, and claimed his only man-of-the-match award in Tests against Australia in Mumbai, but was again dropped two matches later. In late 2005, Kartik became a regular member of the ODI team for a few months when the International Cricket Council introduced an experimental rule that allowed one substitute to be used, opening an extra vacancy in the national team. However, Kartik was unable to secure his position in the team and the rule was later revoked. In late 2007, Kartik broke back into the ODI team and took 6/27 in one victory over Australia, but lost form soon after and was again dropped. He has not represented India since then. Aside from domestic cricket, Kartik plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and has been in demand in English county cricket as an overseas player, representing Lancashire, Middlesex, Somerset and Surrey. Early years Born on 11 September 1976 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Murali Kartik wanted to be a genetic engineer. He was a medium pacer in his early years, before switching to a left arm finger spinner in the classical mould, Kartik grew up trying to emulate past Indian orthodox spinners Bishen Singh Bedi, Maninder Singh and Venkatapathy Raju. He also garnered attention for what was perceived to be a fiery attitude, but took pride in coach Kapil Dev saying of him \\"I have never seen a player with such an attitude towards the game in my 20 years of international cricket\\". Kartik started out in the junior system at Delhi. He broke into their Under-16 team in December 1992, and took a match total of 10/74 on debut against Himachal Pradesh, as well as scoring 52 not out in an innings victory. He took 2/91 in the next match against Haryana, but could no longer play in the Under-16s because of his advancing age. He could not break into the Under-19s at Delhi, and played no further youth domestic matches for two years, when he transferred to Railways and broke into their Under-19 team. In five matches for his new team during the 1994‚Äì95, he took 24 wickets at 14.58 including a haul of 5/28 against Vidarbha. He was rewarded with selection in the Under-19 Central Zone team for the zonal one-day tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. He had little success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, but otherwise only aggregating nine runs in six innings. The following season in 1995‚Äì96, Kartik had a more successful season for Railways Under-19s. He started with 5/73 and 5/55 against Madhya Pradesh and made it three five-wicket hauls in a row with 5/42 against Vidarbha. He took another five-wicket haul later in the season against Rajasthan and ended the competition with 38 wickets at 18.94 in seven matches. Railways made the final, where they faced Punjab. Kartik was Railways' most effective bowler, taking 4/57 in Punjab's first innings of 310. He then made 14 not out as Railways ceded a first innings lead, which was enough to give Punjab the title as the match ended in a draw. Kartik took 3/138 in the second innings. After the final, newly crowned champions took on the Rest of India, and Kartik took 2/25 and 4/89 to help his team to a six- wicket victory. Kartik had a less successful time in the zonal one-dayers for Central, taking only one wicket in three matches. He also improved his batting marginally, scoring 57 and three other double-digit scores. As a result of his performances during the season, Kartik was called up to the Indian Under-19 team for an international series against their counterparts from South Africa. In the youth Test, he took 4/40 as India dismissed South Africa for 159 to take a 19-run lead. In the second innings, he took 3/30 as South Africa fell for 107 in pursuit of 277. In two youth one-day internationals that followed, Kartik was prominent in the Indian victories, taking 3/23 and 3/33 respectively.  Senior domestic debut  The following season, 1996‚Äì97, Kartik was promoted into the senior ranks. In his first match, a List A fixture against Madhya Pradesh, Kartik took 2/27 from his allotment of ten overs but was unable to prevent a four-wicket loss. He made his first-class debut the next day against the same team and sent down 16 overs taking a total of 1/18 in a drawn match. In a close-run match, Madhya Pradesh were 8/89, 17 runs short with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Kartik had scored a rearguard 47 in the second innings, without which Madhya Pradesh would have won. In his next first-class match, against Vidarbha, he took a hat-trick in the first innings, ending with 6/28, helping to bowl Vidarbha out for 130. He then took 3/27 in the second innings as Vidarbha made only 95 to cede victory to Railways. He ended the season with 16 wickets at 19.37, and 185 runs at 20.55 including a 74 against Bengal, but was overlooked for the Central Zone selection for the Duleep Trophy after taking only six wickets in his last four matches for the season. In four one-dayers for Railways, Kartik took seven wickets at 12.42, including a match-winning 4/13 against Rajasthan. The following season he managed 14 wickets at 18.42 in four matches, but was dropped in the later stages of the tournament. After taking a match total of 7/74 in helping to orchestrate an innings victory over Rajasthan in his third match of the season, Kartik went wicketless in the next match against Madhya Pradesh, and was dropped. He scored 70 runs at 23.33 during the tournament. In four one-dayers for Railways, he took four wickets at 29.75 at an economy rate of 3.30. Despite being dropped by Railways, Kartik was called up to make his senior debut for Central Zone. He took two wickets at 63.00 in two first-class matches, and then took three wickets at 43.00 at an economy rate of 4.30 in three matches. Despite the modest returns during the season, Kartik was selected for an India A tour of Pakistan in February and March 1998. In four first-class matches, which were persistently curtailed by the weather, Kartik bowled only 31 overs, and only two in the two matches against Pakistan A. He finished with four wickets at 27.50. In the two one-dayers, he proved expensive, taking 1/53 and 0/73 from ten overs each, as Pakistan won both matches easily. At the start of the 1998‚Äì99 season, Kartik took 23 wickets for Vijay Cricket Club in the Chennai League. He played more regularly in the 1998‚Äì99 Ranji Trophy, taking 29 wickets in seven matches at 19.3 to be the 13th highest wicket-taker. This included a 3/8 and 4/62 in an innings win over Rajasthan, and 5/84 and 5/55 in the last two matches of the campaign against Tamil Nadu and Delhi. He also added 29 and 53 with the bat against Tamil Nadu to help stave off a defeat after his team had trailed by over 200 on the first innings. He was rewarded with selection for Central Zone and after taking 4/133 against North Zone, claimed 5/73 and 2/22 in the final to help them defeat West Zone by 112 runs in Aurangabad to claim the Duleep Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker during the tournament. He scored a total of 183 runs at 18.30 for the entire Indian first-class season. He took five wickets at 26.60 in four zonal one-dayers, and tasted victory in all four fixtures. Early international career Kartik had a truncated but productive 1999‚Äì2000 Indian season. After taking a solitary wicket in a truncated match for India A against the touring New Zealand, Kartik snared 6/62 and 6/31 against Vidarbha, He then went on an India A tour to the West Indies, so his only other first- class match was a Ranji Trophy encounter against Rajasthan in which he took 4/53. In four first-class matches in the Caribbean, Kartik took 18 wickets at 16.38. This included two matches against West Indies A, in which he took 6/75 before claiming 3/64 and 5/73 in the second match, although he was unable to force a victory in either. In two one-day matches against their West Indian counterparts, Kartik took two wickets at 26.00 at an economy rate of 3.46. Returning to India, he took 12 wickets at 13.08 in five matches for Railways and the Indian Board president's XI, before playing in the zonal one-dayers with less success, managing only two wickets at 91.50 at an economy rate of 4.57. Despite these struggles, he was selected for the India A team for the Challenger Trophy, where he took four wickets at 38.00 at the expensive economy rate of 5.84. Despite the downturn in his limited overs fortunes towards the end of the season, Kartik's form was enough to earn him selection in the Indian Board president's XI for the tour match against the visiting South Africans before the Tests. He had a match total of 2/122, which was enough for him to secure national selection, playing in both Tests against South Africa in early 2000 at Mumbai and Bangalore as India sought a second spinner to accompany Anil Kumble, after Harbhajan Singh's performance in the role in the previous season had been deemed inadequate. Kartik scored 14 before being bowled by Shaun Pollock as India batted first and made 225. He then took 2/28 from 18 overs as the Indians restricted the tourists to 176, before collapsing to be all out for 113 in the second innings, Kartik scoring only two before Pollock had him caught behind. Kartik took 1/50 in the second innings as South Africa ground their way to the target of 163 with four wickets in hand. In the Second Test, Kartik took 3/123 and scored a duck and two as India were crushed by an innings. Overall, Kartik performed steadily, taking six wickets at 33.50. Kartik was selected in 2000 for the first intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, after earlier having made his Test debut in early 2000 in a home series against South Africa. However, his stay was cut short along with that of Harbhajan, when they were expelled by the director Hanumant Singh over disciplinary issues. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, Kartik started in fine form as he set out to maintain a Test position. In the Irani Trophy, the traditional season opener between the reigning Ranji champions‚ÄîMumbai‚Äîand the Rest of India, Kartik orchestrated the demise of the title-holders. After taking 4/73 in Mumbai's 260, Kartik scored 22 in the Rest of India's 389. He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory without loss. Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against Madhya Pradesh to secure his spot in the Test team. Kartik then played in one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe respectively in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh but was not required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly‚Äîwho had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash‚Äîdid not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, and did not have an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy. Kartik struggled, taking 2/129 against East and then 0/178 in the first innings as North Zone accumulated 8/690 declared. He then had to endure the humiliation of not being trusted to bowl in the second innings as North reached 8/233. In the last match against South, Kartik could only aggregate 1/87. Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 in his two innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets at an average of 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was discarded as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win and permanently establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble. Kartik played in one more match for Railways at the end of the season, and his poor season continued, managing only a total of 2/152, although he did score 79 with the bat. Kartik started the new 2001‚Äì02 season well, taking 20 wickets at 15.40 in the first four first-class matches of the season, including five-wicket hauls against Rajasthan and Vidarbha, and 3/84 against the touring English Test team for a Board president's XI, but this was not enough to force the selectors to recall him for the Tests. He continued his form for Railways in the one-dayers, taking seven wickets at 20.57 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.00, before suffering a serious back injury that forced him to travel to Adelaide for treatment, which was funded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He made a successful comeback in January after a month-long layoff, and ended as fourth-highest wicket taker in the Ranji Trophy, with 34 at an average of 17, taking 5/51 and 3/7, and scoring 69 in his final match of the season to secure a win over Baroda. He batted well in the second half of the season, also scoring 42 and 58. He also performed well in the Challenger Trophy and zonal one-dayers after his surgery, taking ten wickets at 21.70 in seven matches. At the end of the season, Kartik was rewarded with his debut in One Day Internationals (ODIs); he was punished by the Zimbabwean batsmen, conceding 47 runs without taking a wicket from eight overs, but India still won by five wickets. Fringe player Since then, Kartik was India's third choice Test spinner behind Kumble and Harbhajan for most of the decade, only playing due to their injuries or when India selected three spinners. At the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, Kartik was selected for an India A tour of South Africa. He struggled in the first two first-class matches, before taking 6/101 and scoring 59 in the second match against South Africa A to end the three games with ten wickets at 32.50. He had more success in the one-dayers, taking four wickets at 17.50 at an economy rate of 2.50 in three matches. The West Indies toured India at the start of the 2002‚Äì03 season and Kartik had a chance to press his claims for Test selection in two tour matches against the visitors. However, he had little impact, taking 2/92 for the Board president's XI and 0/117 for Railways against the Caribbean tourists, although he scored 72 with the bat in the latter match. He then took a total of 2/135 as Railways, the reigning Ranji Trophy holders, defeated the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. With these lean returns, Kartik was overlooked for the Tests. Kartik had opportunities in the ODI format following his strong form in domestic limited overs matches, playing in four consecutive matches against the West Indies. After going wicketless in the first of these matches, he broke through in the next match to take his maiden ODI wicket in his third appearance. Kartik then took 3/36 in the next match as India scraped home by three wickets, but he was punished in his fourth outing of the series, conceding 69 runs in nine overs without success, after which he was dropped. He had taken four wickets at 47.25, at an economy rate of 4.84. Kartik was called into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, in which he was hammered for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler‚ÄîHarbhajan‚Äîin the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred. While the World Cup was in progress, Kartik toured the West Indies with India A, playing against the domestic teams in five first-class matches. He took 14 wickets at 30.50 including a 5/105 against Barbados and 4/57 against Trinidad and Tobago. India A then toured England during the northern hemisphere summer and Kartik took 10 wickets at 40.00 and scored 79 runs at 26.33 including a 50 in four first- class matches, and three wickets at 44.33 in one-dayers. At the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, Kartik took 2/118 and 2/41 for India A in a match against the touring New Zealanders, and was overlooked for the Test series against the visitors. He managed only a total of 1/84 from 18 overs in the Challenger Trophy but was called into the ODI team and gained semi-regular appearances during the TVS Trophy against New Zealand and Australia, competing with Kumble and Harbhajan for a regular position in the team. In four matches during the competition, he was economical although not very penetrative, taking four wickets at 38.25 at an economy rate of 3.82.  Occasional international appearances in 2004 and 2005  After taking match figures of 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik made his first overseas appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003‚Äì04 tour of Australia. He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australian A. He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for the only time in the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of1/211 from 45 overs, a run rate of 4.68, in a high-scoring draw. Kartik then made sporadic appearances in the VB triangular ODI series, playing in four of India's ten matches, as he and Kumble were brought in and out of the team in an attempt to challenge the Australian superiority. He continued to be punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/178 from 26 overs, an economy rate of 6.84. However, he did manage to resist the Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively. Despite these performances, Kartik was retained for the ODI tour of Pakistan with Harbhajan still injured, taking five wickets at 32.80 at an economy of 5.46. He played in three of the five matches and India won all of these. Kartik was also in the Test squad, but saw not action as India opted to field only Kumble and took the series 2‚Äì1. Kartik started the 2004‚Äì05 season by scoring 56 and 16 and taking 2/42 and 2/49 as the Rest of India defeated Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, but it was not enough to prevent Harbhajan from resuming his position in the team for the home Test series against Australia. He got an opportunity in the Third Test in Nagpur, when Harbhajan was ill, taking 3/57 and 2/74 as India were 342 runs to lose their first home series to Australia since 1969‚Äì70. Kartik held his place when Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai as India fielded three spinners, and took 4/44 and 3/32 in a man of the match performance which saw India win by 13 runs. Both of these performances occurred under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid with Ganguly injured, in which Kartik netted his wickets at an average of 17.50 compared to 51.08 under Ganguly's leadership. Kartik played the last of his eight Tests in a subsequent opening match against South Africa in Kanpur, taking a total of 2/93 under Ganguly's command, being dropped after India chose to only use two spinners in subsequent matches. Kartik spent the next month watching from the sidelines as the reserve slow bowler, as only Kumble and Harbhajan played during the tour of Bangladesh. During this campaign, he was allowed to play in the second ODI, taking 2/43 as India lost to Bangladesh for the first time. Kartik returned to India and took seven wickets at 35.42 at an economy rate of 4.69 in the zonal one-dayers and Challenger Trophy, and then played four first-class matches to end the season, taking 10 wickets at 19.10. At the end of the season, he took 2/54 in a home ODI against Pakistan, who scored 7/319 to overhaul the target. He enjoyed more opportunities in the ODI arena in 2005, when Kumble was dropped by newly appointed coach Greg Chappell due to his lack of athleticism, as well as the introduction of the experimental rules which allowed the use of one substitute, thus opening an extra position in the team. Kartik had a modest start under the new regime, taking 1/52 from nine overs in a win over a depleted host Zimbabwe team. He returned to India and started the new season in fine all-round form. After taking 2/34 in the first innings, he scored his highest first-class score of 96 to guide Railways to 311, giving them a first- innings lead of 88 runs over the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. He then took 3/28 to dismiss the Rest of India for 137 in their second innings, setting up a nine-wciket win. He then took seven wickets at 16.85 at an economy rate of 4.56 in three matches for India Seniors in the Challenger Trophy, including a match-winning 5/29 in the final against India B. Kartik was thus selected in the Indian ODI team for the home summer, and played in ten of the twelve ODIs that India hosted in late 2005. He started well with 3/48 in a 152-run crushing of Sri Lanka in Nagpur, and went on to finish the series with eight wickets at 30.25, playing in six of the seven matches. However, his form dissipated and he went wicketless in the South African series, conceding 126 runs in 28 overs, and giving away more than a run a ball in the last two matches. Kumble remained in favour for the Tests along with Harbhajan, and Kartik returned to Ranji competition while they bowled against Sri Lanka in the five-dayers. Kartik took 5/95 against Mumbai and then 8/40 against Delhi, and in three Ranji Trophy matches took 17 wickets at 19.94. Despite his ineffectiveness against South Africa, Kartik was retained in the ODI squad, but after conceding 64 runs from nine overs in the first ODI loss against Pakistan, he was replaced in early-2006 in the Test and ODI squad by 17-year-old legspinner Piyush Chawla and off-spinner Ramesh Powar respectively.  Discarded again  In late 2006, India's ODI team began to hit rocky waters. After losing a bilateral series in the West Indies, they were knocked out of a triangular tournament in Malaysia ahead of the finals, and were eliminated in the first round of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy on home soil. Kartik took four wickets at 34.00 and an economy rate of 5.36 in the Challenger Trophy and could not earn a recall. He had a steady domestic first-class season, taking 26 wickets at 25.53 in nine matches, never taking more than five wickets in a match. He took 13 wickets at 27.92 in eight one- day matches for the season, and was overlooked as Kumble and Harbhajan were the spinners selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. India were knocked out in the first round after losing to Bangladesh, and Harbhajan was dropped while Kumble retired from ODIs, but Kartik did not do enough to persuade the selectors to hand him a recall. In 2004, Kartik played in the Lancashire League with Ramsbottom as their professional. In 19 games, he took 80 wickets at 9.92 and scored 464 runs at 25.77. He scored three fifties with a best of 83 against Colne and took nine five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/30 against Enfield in addition to two other matches in which he took seven wickets. In 2005, he returned to Ramsbottom as their professional for a second season, with more effect. He took 83 wickets at 9.19 and scored 519 runs at 37.07 in 20 matches. He scored five fifties including a best of 66, and took eight five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/47 against Church as well as 7/27 against Lowerhouse. These performances earned him notice, and in late 2005, he appeared as a late-season overseas player substitute for Lancashire, and became the first overseas Lancashire player to take ten wickets on their debut, with 10/168 against Essex. This 5/93 and 5/75 helped Lancashire to an eight-wicket win, and in his only other first-class match, he took 4/43 and 2/49 was not enough as the Roses went down to Leicestershire by four runs. His sixteen wickets at 16.25 placed him second on the season's bowling averages, and helped the team to be promoted from Second Division. In two one-day games, Kartik took five wickets at 13.40. Despite these performances, he was not initially offered a contract for 2006. Eventually in August 2006, he was again signed as a late-season overseas player for Lancashire just in time to appear in the C&G; Trophy final against Sussex, taking 2/28 and scoring a duck in a 15-run defeat. He took eight wickets at 17.25 in four one-dayers, and six wickets at 39.00 in three first-class matches with a best of 3/89, as well a 40 with the bat against Hampshire. In 2007, he joined Middlesex as an overseas registration. He made his debut as the county club's 700th first-class cricketer against Somerset at Taunton in April 2007. He took 51 wickets at 24.96 in 12 matches and agreed to sign on for a further season in 2008. A highlight of Kartik's stint was a haul of 6/21 and 3/52 that helped set up an innings win over Glamorgan, and 6/85 and 3/83 that secured a 38-run win over Leicestershire. A third five-wicket haul, 5/38 against Derbyshire, was not enough to prevent a 15-run defeat. With the bat, Kartik contributed 209 runs at 19.00 with a best of 35. Kartik was also prolific for his new county in the one-dayers, taking 21 wickets at 23.52 in 15 matches, taking three wickets in a match twice, both of which resulted in wins. During the T20 tournament, Kartik took nine wickets at 10.77 and an economy rate of 5.70, including a haul of 5/13 in a vain attempt to halt an Essex run-chase.  Brief international return and later career  In late 2007, Kartik was recalled to the ODI team in place of the struggling Powar midway through the series against Australia. He played his first ODI in 18 months when he returned for the fourth match at Mohali. He took 1/48, and conceded only two runs in the 48th over as Australia stumbled in a tight run chase to give India their first win of the series. Kartik took only one wicket in the next two matches, which Australia won. In the seventh and final match, Kartik took a career best of 6/27 from 10 overs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to bowl Australia out for 193. The tourists had reached 2/117 after 19.4 overs, scoring at over six runs and over before Kartik removed Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds from consecutive balls. He failed to get his hat-trick, but in the 32nd over he removed Brad Haddin from the first ball, and then Brad Hogg and Brett Lee from the fourth and fifth balls. Again Kartik missed the hat-trick opportunity, but returned to claim his six wicket. In reply, India had fallen to 8/143 before Kartik chipped in with an unbeaten 21 from 34 balls in an unbroken 52-run stand with Zaheer Khan, guiding India to a two-wicket victory. Kartik was recognised by being selected as the man of the match. Kartik then made his T20 international debut, taking 0/27 from four overs in an Indian win over Australia. In the following series against Pakistan, Kartik was only selected in the first, third and fifth matches, and took two wickets at an average of 68.00 at an economy rate of 5.23. As a result, Kartik was omitted from the ODI tour of Australia in favour of Chawla. Due to his international commitments, Kartik made only sporadic appearances during the Indian domestic scene in 2007‚Äì08. He took nine wickets at 44.22 and scored 77 runs at 19.25 in three first-class fixtures. After being dropped from India's limited-overs team, Kartik continued his strong one-day form at domestic level, taking six wickets at 25.33 at an economy rate of only 3.16 in six matches. Kartik was purchased by the Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League. He played in six matches, taking three wickets at 42.33, but was dropped because his economy rate was beyond eight runs an over. All of these came in one match in which he took 3/17. Kartik playing an unorthodox shot for Somerset in 2010.Kartik was part of the Middlesex team that won the 2008 Twenty20 Cup in England, their first domestic title for 15 years. He played in 11 matches and took 14 wickets at 20.14 at an economy rate of 6.71, claiming at least one wicket in all but one of the matches. Kartik represented Middlesex in the Stanford competition in October, taking two wickets at 25.50 at an economy rate of 6.37. His second first-class season with Middlesex was much less successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day form was also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches. Kartik returned to India and took 16 wickets at 32.75 in six matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy. After taking 5/85 in the first innings of the season opener against Karnataka, his performances fell away and he managed only four wickets in his last three matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy and took a total of 2/98 as they lost on first innings to South and were eliminated after one match. Kartik made some contributions with the bat, scoring 197 runs at 24.62 for the season, including a score of 56 against Maharashtra and two other efforts of 30. Playing for both Railways and Central, Kartik took 12 wickets at 23.50 in the one-day matches for the season. He also scored 65 runs at 13.00. During the 2009 IPL season, which was held in South Africa, Kartik played in ten matches and took four wickets at 50.25, but he was one of the most economical bowlers, conceding only 5.91 runs per over. Kolkata were wracked by infighting and came last. Kartik also scored 21 runs without being dismissed. In the 2009 English season, Kartik resumed service for Middlesex, and as in the IPL he was most effective as a stock bowler, taking only four wickets at 51.50 in eight T20 fixtures at an economy rate of 6.86, never taking multiple wickets in a match. Middlesex, who had won the domestic title the previous year, only tasted victory in two of the Twenty20 matches that Kartik played in. Kartik played in ten first-class matches for Middlesex, taking 33 wickets at 22.87. He took his season's innings best of 5/65 and then 2/26 in the season opener against cross-London rivals Surrey, and then took 3/32 and 4/53 in a hard-fought 47-run win over Kent, and a total of 6/139 in the next match against Essex, but his season fell away at the end, managing only six wickets in the last three matches. With the bat, he made 336 runs at 24.00, the most prolific season of his career with the willow, including 62 against Essex and 57 not out against Gloucestershire. He played in a solitary one-dayer, taking 2/19 against Northamptonshire. At the end of the 2009 season, it was announced that Kartik would join Somerset as their overseas player for the 2010 season. During the 2009‚Äì10 Indian season, Kartik played in seven matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy, taking 17 wickets at 25.05 including a best of 5/81 against Mumbai. He also scored 44 against the team and ended with 97 runs at 12.12 for the season. However his figures were not enough to gain selection for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy. As of 2019 he is currently a cricket commentator.

Russia had been experiencing the Time of Troubles since the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598, causing political instability and a violent succession crisis upon the extinction of the Rurik dynasty, and was ravaged by the major famine of 1601 to 1603. Poland exploited Russia's civil wars when members of the Polish szlachta aristocracy began influencing Russian boyars and supporting False Dmitris for the title of Tsar of Russia against the crowned Boris Godunov and Vasili IV Shuysky.https://www.cairn.info/revue-cahiers-du-monde- russe-2016-4-page-879.htm In 1605, King Sigismund III Vasa informally invaded Russia until the death of False Dmitry I in 1606, and invaded again in 1607 until Russia formed a military alliance with Sweden in 1609. Sigismund formally declared war on Russia in response, aiming to gain territorial concessions and weaken Sweden's ally, winning many early victories such as the Battle of Klushino. In 1610, Polish forces entered Moscow and Sweden withdrew from the military alliance with Russia, instead triggering the Ingrian War. Sigismund's son, the Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Poland, was elected tsar by the Seven Boyars in September 1610, but Sigismund seized the Russian throne for himself to convert the population to Catholicism, with the pro-Polish boyars ending their support for the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In 1611, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky formed a new army to launch a popular revolt against the Polish occupation. The Poles captured Smolensk in June 1611 but began to retreat after they were ousted from Moscow in September 1612. Michael Romanov, the son of Patriarch Filaret of Moscow, was elected Tsar of Russia in 1613, beginning the Romanov dynasty and ending the Time of Troubles. With little military action between 1612 and 1617, the war finally ended in 1618 with the Truce of Deulino, which granted the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth certain territorial concessions but preserved Russia's independence. The war was the first major sign of rivalry and uneasy relations between Poland and Russia which last to this day. Its aftermath had a long-lasting impact on Russian society; it coined a stereotypical negative image of Poland in Russia,https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/item/31226/goszczynski_nieprzyjaciel_narodu_naszego_historia_stosunkow.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y and, most notably, it gave rise to the Romanovs, which ruled Russia for three centuries until the February Revolution in 1917. It also left a noticeable mark in Russian culture, with renowned composers and writers portraying the war in their works such as A Life for the Tsar by Mikhail Glinka, Boris Godunov (opera) by Modest Mussorgsky, Boris Godunov (play) by Alexander Pushkin, Pan Voyevoda by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as well as films Minin and Pozharsky and 1612. Names of the war The conflict is often referred to by different names, most commonly the Russo‚ÄìPolish War, with the term Russia replacing the term Muscovy. In Polish historiography, the wars are usually referred to as the Dimitriads: the First Dymitriad (1605‚Äì1606) and Second Dymitriad (1607‚Äì1609) and the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1609‚Äì1618), which can subsequently be divided into two wars of 1609‚Äì1611 and 1617‚Äì1618, and may or may not include the 1617‚Äì1618 campaign, which is sometimes referred to as Chodkiewicz [Muscovite] Campaign. According to Russian historiography, the chaotic events of the war fall into the \\"Time of Troubles\\". The conflict with Poles is commonly called the Polish Invasion, Polish Intervention, or more specifically the Polish Intervention of the Early Seventeenth Century.

After the death of the Tsar Ivan IV (\\"the Terrible\\") in 1584, and the death of his son Dimitri in 1591, several factions competed for the tsar's throne. In 1598, Boris Godunov was crowned to the Russian throne, marking the end of the centuries long rule of the Rurik dynasty. While his policies were rather moderate and well-intentioned, his rule was marred by the general perception of its questionable legitimacy and allegations of his involvement in orchestrating the assassination of Dimitri. While Godunov managed to put the opposition to his rule under control, he did not manage to crush it completely. To add to his troubles, the first years of the 17th century were exceptionally cold. The drop in temperature was felt all over the world, and was most likely caused by a severe eruption of a volcano in South America. In Russia, it resulted in a great famine that swept through the country from 1601 to 1603. Polish cavalry armour from the 16th or 17th century In late 1600, a Polish diplomatic mission led by Chancellor Lew Sapieha with Eliasz Pielgrzymowski and Stanis≈Çaw Warszycki arrived in Moscow and proposed an alliance between the Commonwealth and Russia, which would include a future personal union. They proposed that after one monarch's death without heirs, the other would become the ruler of both countries. However, Tsar Godunov declined the union proposal and settled on extending the Treaty of Jam Zapolski, which ended the Lithuanian wars of the 16th century, by 22 years (to 1622). Sigismund and the Commonwealth magnates knew full well that they were not capable of any serious invasion of Russia; the Commonwealth army was too small, its treasury always empty, and the war lacked popular support. However, as the situation in Russia deteriorated, Sigismund and many Commonwealth magnates, especially those with estates and forces near the Russian border, began to look for a way to profit from the chaos and weakness of their eastern neighbour. This proved easy, as in the meantime many Russian boyars, disgruntled by the ongoing civil war, tried to entice various neighbors, including the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, into intervening. Some of them looked to their own profits, trying to organize support for their own ascension to the Russian throne. Others looked to their western neighbor, the Commonwealth, and its attractive Golden Freedoms, and together with some Polish politicians planned for some kind of union between those two states. Yet others tried to tie their fates with that of Sweden in what became known as the De la Gardie Campaign and the Ingrian War. Advocates for a union of Poland‚ÄìLithuania with Russia proposed a plan similar to the original Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union of Lublin involving a common foreign policy and military; the right for nobility to choose the place where they would live and to buy landed estates; the removal of barriers for trade and transit; the introduction of a single currency; increased religious tolerance in Russia (especially the right to build churches of non-Orthodox faiths); and the sending of boyar children for an education in more developed Polish academies (like the Jagiellonian University). However, this project never gained much support. Many boyars feared that the union with the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania would endanger Russia's Orthodox traditions and opposed anything that threatened the Russian culture, especially the policies aimed at curtailing the influence of the Orthodox Church, intermarriage and education in Polish schools that has already led to successful Polonization of the Ruthenian lands under Polish control.

For most of the 17th century, Sigismund III was occupied with internal problems of his own, like the Nobles' Rebellion in the Commonwealth and the wars with Sweden and in Moldavia. However, the impostor False Dmitry I appeared in Poland in 1603 and soon found enough support among powerful magnates such as Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniowiecki, Lew and Jan Piotr Sapieha, who provided him with funds for a campaign against Godunov. Commonwealth magnates looked forward to material gains from the campaign and control over Russia through False Dmitriy. In addition, both Polish magnates and Russian boyars advanced plans for a union between the Commonwealth and Russia, similar to the one Lew Sapieha had discussed in 1600 (when the idea had been dismissed by Godunov). Finally, the proponents of Catholicism saw in Dmitry a tool to spread the influence of their Church eastwards, and after promises of a united Catholic dominated Russo-Polish entity waging a war on the Ottoman Empire, Jesuits also provided him with funds and education. Although Sigismund declined to support Dmitry officially with the full might of the Commonwealth, the Polish king was always happy to support pro-Catholic initiatives and provided him with the sum of 4,000 zlotys‚Äìenough for a few hundred soldiers. Nonetheless, some of Dmitriy's supporters, especially among those involved in the rebellion, actively worked to have Dmitry replace Sigismund. In exchange, in June 1604 Dmitry promised the Commonwealth \\"half of Smolensk territory\\". Many were skeptical about the future of this endeavor. Jan Zamoyski, opposed to most of Sigismund's policies, later referred to the entire False Dmitry I affair as a \\"comedy worthy of Plautus or Terentius\\". When Boris Godunov heard about the pretender, he claimed that the man was just a runaway monk called Grigory Otrepyev, although on what information he based this claim is unclear. Godunov's support among the Russians began to wane, especially when he tried to spread counter-rumors. Some of the Russian boyars also claimed to accept Dmitry as such support gave them legitimate reasons not to pay taxes to Godunov. Last minutes of False Dmitry I by Carl Wenig, painted in 1879. False Dmitry tried to flee from the plotters through a window but broke his leg and was shot. After cremation his ashes were shot from a cannon towards Poland. Dmitry attracted a number of followers, formed a small army, and, supported by approximately 3500 soldiers of the Commonwealth magnates' private armies and the mercenaries bought by Dmitriy's own cash, rode to Russia in June 1604. Some of Godunov's other enemies, including approximately 2,000 southern Cossacks, joined Dimitry's forces on his way to Moscow. Dmitriy's forces fought two engagements with reluctant Russian soldiers; his army won the first at Novhorod-Siverskyi, soon capturing Chernigov, Putivl, Sevsk, and Kursk, but badly lost the second Battle of Dobrynichi and nearly disintegrated. Dmitry's cause was only saved by the news of the death of Tsar Boris Godunov. The sudden death of the Tsar on 13 April 1605 removed the main barrier to further advances by Dimitry. Russian troops began to defect to his side, and, on 1 June, boyars in Moscow imprisoned the newly crowned tsar, Boris's son Feodor II, and the boy's mother, later brutally murdering them. On 20 June the impostor made his triumphal entry into Moscow, and on 21 July he was crowned Tsar by a new Patriarch of his own choosing, the Greek Cypriot Patriarch Ignatius, who as bishop of Ryazan had been the first church leader to recognize Dmitry as Tsar. The alliance with Poland was furthered by Dimitriy's marriage (per procura in Krak√≥w) with the daughter of Jerzy Mniszech, Marina Mniszech, a Polish noblewoman with whom Dmitry had fallen in love while in Poland. The new Tsarina outraged many Russians by refusing to convert from Catholicism to the Russian Orthodox faith. Commonwealth king Sigismund was a prominent guest at this wedding. Marina soon left to join her husband in Moscow, where she was crowned a Tsarina in May. While Dmitry's rule itself was nondescript and devoid of significant blunders, his position was weak. Many boyars felt they could gain more influence, even the throne, for themselves, and many were still wary of Polish cultural influence, especially in view of Dmitriy's court being increasingly dominated by the aliens he brought with himself from Poland. The Golden Freedoms, declaring all nobility equal, that were supported by lesser nobility, threatened the most powerful of the boyars. Thus the boyars, headed by Prince Vasily Shuyski, began to plot against Dmitry and his pro-Polish faction, accusing him of homosexuality, spreading Roman Catholicism and Polish customs, and selling Russia to Jesuits and the Pope. They gained popular support, especially as Dmitry was visibly supported by few hundred irregular Commonwealth forces, which still garrisoned Moscow, and often engaged in various criminal acts, angering the local population. On the morning of 17 May 1606, about two weeks after the marriage, conspirators stormed the Kremlin. Dmitry tried to flee through a window but broke his leg in the fall. One of the plotters shot him dead on the spot. At first the body was put on display, but it was later cremated; the ashes reportedly shot from a cannon towards Poland. Dmitriy's reign had lasted a mere ten months. Vasili Shuyski took his place as Tsar. About five hundred of Dmitriy's Commonwealth supporters were killed, imprisoned or forced to leave Russia. The Second Polish invasion (1607‚Äì1609) Jan Piotr Sapieha, Polish commander of troops stationing in Moscow. Sapieha was known for his ruthlessness towards the Russian people and was nicknamed Pan Hetman, meaning \\"Mr General\\". Tsar Vasili Shuyski was unpopular and weak in Russia and his reign was far from stable. He was perceived as anti-Polish; he had led the coup against the first False Dmitry, killing over 500 Polish soldiers in Moscow and imprisoning a Polish envoy. The civil war raged on, as in 1607 the False Dmitry II appeared, again supported by some Polish magnates and 'recognized' by Marina Mniszech as her first husband. This brought him the support of the magnates of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth who had supported False Dmitry I before. Adam Wi≈õniowiecki, Roman R√≥≈ºy≈Ñski, Jan Piotr Sapieha decided to support the second pretender as well, supplying him with some early funds and about 7,500 soldiers. The pillaging of his army, especially of the Lisowczycy mercenaries led by Aleksander Lisowski, contributed to the placard in Sergiyev Posad: \\"three plagues: typhus, Tatars and Poles\\". In 1608 together with Aleksander Kleczkowski, Lisowczycy, leading a few hundred Don Cossacks working for the Commonwealth, ragtag szlachta and mercenaries, defeated the army of tsar Vasili Shuyski led by Zakhary Lyapunov and Ivan Khovansky at the Battle of Zaraysk and captured Mikhailov and Kolomna. Then Lisowczycy advanced towards Moscow, but was defeated by Vasiliy Buturlin at the Battle of Medvezhiy Brod, losing most of its plunder. When Polish commander Jan Piotr Sapieha failed to win the siege of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, Lisowczycy retreated to the vicinity of Rakhmantsevo. Soon, however, came successes (pillages) at Kostroma, Soligalich and some other cities. Dmitry speedily captured Karachev, Bryansk and other towns. He was reinforced by the Poles, and in the spring of 1608 advanced upon Moscow, routing the army of Tsar Vasily Shuyski at Bolkhov. Dmitry's promises of the wholesale confiscation of the estates of the boyars drew many common people to his side. The village of Tushino, about twelve kilometers from the capital, was converted into an armed camp, where Dmitry gathered his army. His forces initially included 7,000 Polish soldiers, 10,000 Cossacks and 10,000 other soldiers, including former members of the failed rokosz of Zebrzydowski, but his force grew gradually in power, and soon exceeded 100,000 men. He raised another illustrious captive, Feodor Romanov, to the rank of Patriarch, enthroning him as Patriarch Filaret, and won the allegiance of the cities of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vologda, Kashin and several others. However, his fortunes were soon to reverse, as the Commonwealth decided to take a more active stance in the Russian civil wars.

Painting by Sergey Miloradovich. In 1609 the Zebrzydowski Rebellion ended when Tsar Vasili signed a military alliance with Charles IX of Sweden (on 28 February 1609). The Commonwealth king Sigismund III, whose primary goal was to regain the Swedish throne, got permission from the Polish Sejm (Parliament) to declare war on Russia. He viewed it as an excellent opportunity to expand the Commonwealth's territory and sphere of influence, with hopes that the eventual outcome of the war would Catholicize Orthodox Russia (in this he was strongly supported by the Pope) and enable him to defeat Sweden. This plan also allowed him to give a purpose to the numerous restless former supporters of Zebrzydowski, luring them with promises of wealth and fame awaiting members of the campaign beyond the Commonwealth's eastern border. A book published that year by the well- travelled Polish Silesian nobleman, courtier and political activist Pawe≈Ç Palczowski of Palczowic, Kolƒôda moskiewska (The Muscovite Carol), compared Russia to the Indian empires of the New World, full of golden cities and easy to conquer. The treatise was written to promote Polish colonialism and persuade delegates of the Sejm in January 1609 to support Sigismund III's expedition to Muscovy. Palczowski himself participated in and perished during Sigismund's Muscovy expedition.Sarmatian Review, Rice University, Texas, January 2011, Vol. XXXI, No. 1., p. 1561; The Muscovite Carol (Kolƒôda moskiewska) by Pawe≈Ç Palczowski of Palczowic. Edited by Grzegorz Franczak. Some Russian boyars assured Sigismund of their support by offering the throne to his son, Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw. Previously, Sigismund had been unwilling to commit the majority of Polish forces or his time to the internal conflict in Russia, but in 1609 those factors made him re-evaluate and drastically change his policy. Victorious Sigismund III of Poland at Smolensk, by Italian-born artist Tommaso Dolabella Although many Polish nobles and soldiers were fighting for the second False Dmitry at the time, Sigismund III and the troops under his command did not support Dimitriy for the throne ‚Äì Sigismund wanted Russia himself. The entry of Sigismund into Russia caused the majority of the Polish supporters of False Dmitry II to desert him and contributed to his defeat. A series of subsequent disasters induced False Dmitry II to flee his camp disguised as a peasant and to go to Kostroma together with Marina. Dmitry made another unsuccessful attack on Moscow, and, supported by the Don Cossacks, recovered a hold over all of south-eastern Russia. He was killed, however, while half drunk, on 11 December 1610 by a Qasim Tatar princeling Pyotr Urusov, whom Dimitriy had flogged on a previous occasion. A Commonwealth army under the command of Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, who was generally opposed to this conflict but could not disobey king's orders, crossed the border and on 29 September 1609 laid siege to Smolensk, an important city Russia had captured from Lithuania in 1514. Smolensk was manned by fewer than 1,000 Russian men commanded by the voivod Mikhail Shein, while ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski commanded 12,000 troops. However, Smolensk had one major advantage: the previous Tsar, Boris Godunov, had sponsored the fortification of the city with a massive fortress completed in 1602. The Poles found it impenetrable; they settled into a long siege, firing artillery into the city, attempting to tunnel under the moat, and building earthen ramparts, remnants of which can still be seen today. The siege lasted 20 months before the Poles advised by the runaway traitor succeeded in taking the fortress. Siege of Smolensk (1609‚Äì1611) by the Polish army, by an anonymous author, possibly a witness of the siege Not all of the Commonwealth attacks were successful. An early attack, led by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz with 2,000 men, ended in defeat when the unpaid Commonwealth army mutinied and compelled their leader to retreat through the heart of Russia and back to Smolensk. Not until the crown prince, W≈Çadys≈Çaw, arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war assume a different character. In the meantime, Lisowczycy took and plundered Pskov in 1610 and clashed with the Swedes operating in Russia during the Ingrian War. Several different visions of the campaign and political goals clashed in the Polish camp. Some of the former members of the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, opponents of Sigismund, actually advanced proposals to have Sigismund dethroned and Dmitriy, or even Shuyski, elected king. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, who from the beginning opposed the invasion of Russia, came into conflict with Sigismund over the scope, methods and goal of the campaign. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski represented the traditional views of Polish nobility, the szlachta, which did not support waging aggressive and dangerous wars against a strong enemy like Russia. Thus ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski favored the plans for peaceful and voluntary union, much like that with Lithuania. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski offered Russian boyars rights and religious freedom, envisioning an association resulting in the creation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth. To that end, he felt that Moscow's cooperation should be gained via diplomacy, not force. Sigismund III, however, did not want to engage in political deals and compromises, especially when these had to include concessions to the Orthodox Church. Sigismund was a vocal, almost fanatical supporter of the Catholic Church and counter- reformation, and believed that he could win everything and take Moscow by force, and then establish his own rule along with the rule of the Roman Catholicism. Poles in Moscow (1610) On 31 January 1610 Sigismund received a delegation of boyars opposed to Shuyski, who asked W≈Çadys≈Çaw to become the tsar. On 24 February Sigismund sent them a letter in which he agreed to do so, but only when Moscow was at peace. The so-called \\"Sigismundian\\" map illustrating Moscow in 1610, commissioned by Sigismund III of Poland Hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, whose only other choice was mutiny, decided to follow the king's orders and left Smolensk in 1610, leaving only a smaller force necessary to continue the siege. With Cossack reinforcements, he marched on Moscow. However, as he feared and predicted, as the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces pressed eastwards, ravaging Russian lands, and as Sigismund's lack of willingness to compromise became more and more apparent, many supporters of the Poles and of the second False Dmitry left the pro-Polish camp and turned to Shuyski's anti-Polish faction. Polish Hussar formation at the Battle of Klushino. Russian forces under Grigory Voluyev were coming to relieve Smolensk and fortified the fort at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche (Carowo, Cariewo, Tsarovo‚ÄìZajmiszcze) to bar the Poles' advance on Moscow. The Siege of Tsaryovo began on 24 June. However, the Russians were not prepared for a long siege and had little food and water inside the fort. Voluyev sent word for Dmitry Shuyski (Tsar Shuyski's brother) to come to their aid and lift the siege. Shuyski's troops marched for Tsaryovo, not by the direct route, but round- about through Klushino, hoping to come to Tsaryovo by the back route. Shuyski received aid from Swedish forces under the command of Jacob Pontusson De la Gardie. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski learned of Shuyski's relief force and divided his troops to meet the Russians before they could come to Tsaryovo and lift the siege. He left at night so that Voluyev would not notice his absence. The combined Russian and Swedish armies were defeated on 4 July 1610 at the battle of Klushino (K≈Çuszyn), where 7,000 Polish elite cavalry, the winged hussars, led by the hetman himself, defeated the numerically superior Russian army of about 35,000‚Äì40,000 soldiers. This giant and surprising defeat of the Russians shocked everyone and opened a new phase in the conflict. Shuyski Tsar brought by ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski to the Sejm in Warsaw before Sigismund III, by Jan Matejko After the news of Klushino spread, support for tsar Shuyski almost completely evaporated. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski soon convinced the Russian units at Tsaryovo, which were much stronger than the ones at K≈Çuszyn, to capitulate and to swear an oath of loyalty to W≈Çadys≈Çaw. Then he incorporated them into his army and moved towards Moscow. In August 1610 many Russian boyars accepted that Sigismund III was victorious and that W≈Çadys≈Çaw would become the next tsar if he converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. The Russian Duma voted for Tsar Shuyski to be removed from the throne. Shuyski's family, including the tsar, were captured, and Shuyski was reportedly taken to a monastery, forcibly shaved as a monk, and compelled to remain at the monastery under guard. He was later sent to Warsaw, as a kind of war trophy, and eventually died in Gostynin. Shortly after Shuyski was removed, both ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and the second False Dmitri arrived at Moscow with their separate armies. It was a tense moment, filled with the confusion of the conflict. Various pro- and anti-Polish, Swedish and domestic boyar factions vied for the temporary control of the situation. The Russian army and the people themselves were unsure if this was an invasion and that they should close and defend the city, or if it was a liberating force that should be allowed in and welcomed as allies. After a few skirmishes, the pro-Polish faction gained dominance, and the Poles were allowed into Moscow on 8 October. The boyars opened Moscow's gates to the Polish troops and asked ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski to protect them from anarchy. The Moscow Kremlin was then garrisoned by Polish troops commanded by Aleksander Gosiewski. On 27 July a treaty was signed between the boyars and ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski promising the Russian boyars the same vast privileges the Polish szlachta had, in exchange for them recognizing W≈Çadys≈Çaw as the new tsar. However, ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski did not know that Sigismund, who remained at Smolensk, already had other plans. Shuyski Tsar at the Sejm in Warsaw, by Jan Matejko, oil on canvas In the meantime, ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and the second False Dmitriy, formerly reluctant allies, began to part ways. The second False Dmitry had lost much of his influence over the Polish court, and ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski would eventually try to drive Dmitry from the capital. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski soon began manoeuvring for a tsar of Polish origin, particularly the 15-year-old Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw. The boyars had offered the throne to W≈Çadys≈Çaw at least twice, in the hopes of having the liberal Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth end the despotic rule of their current tsars. Through ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's work, the pro-Polish factions among the boyars (composed of knyazes Fyodor Mstislavsky, Vasily Galitzine, Fyodor Sheremetev, Daniil Mezetsky and diaks Vasily Telepnyov and Tomi≈Ço ≈Åagowski) gained dominance and once again a majority of the boyars said that they would support W≈Çadys≈Çaw for the throne, if he converted to Orthodoxy and if the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth returned the fortresses that they had captured in the war. However, Sigismund, supported by some of the more devout and zealous nobility, was completely opposed to the conversion of the prince. From that point the planned Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite union began to fall apart. Offended and angered by Sigismund, the boyars dragged their feet on supporting W≈Çadys≈Çaw. They were divided between electing Vasily Galitzine, Michael Romanov (also 15 years old), or the second False Dmitriy. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski acted quickly, making promises without the consent of the still-absent king, and the boyars elected W≈Çadys≈Çaw as the new tsar. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski had the most prominent of the opponents, Fyodor Romanov, Michael's father and the patriarch of Moscow, exiled from Russia in order to secure Polish support. After the election of W≈Çadys≈Çaw, the second False Dmitry fled from Tushino, a city near Moscow, to his base at Kaluga. However, his position was precarious even there, and he was killed on 20 December by one of his own men. Marina Mniszech, though, was pregnant with the new \\"heir\\" to the Russian throne, Ivan Dmitriyevich, and she would still be a factor in Russian politics until her eventual death in 1614. W≈Çadys≈Çaw faced further opposition from a seemingly unlikely party: his father. When ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski returned to meet Sigismund at Smolensk in November of that year, Sigismund III changed his mind and decided that he could gain the Russian throne for himself. A majority of the Russians opposed the move, especially as Sigismund didn't hide his intent to Catholicize and Polonize the Russian Tsardom. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski found himself in an awkward position ‚Äì he had promised the boyars Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw to keep the Russian throne for Poland, and he knew that they would not accept Sigismund III, who was unpopular throughout Russia. However, he also had to explain this to his king, who was convinced, from his conquests in the west, of his popularity in Russia. Eventually, ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, disappointed with Sigismund, returned to Poland. Sigismund eventually compromised and decided that he would allow his son to take the throne and that he would rule as regent until W≈Çadys≈Çaw came of age. Thus, he required that the boyars who submitted and swore allegiance to Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw would also have to swear an oath to him. The boyars were more resistant to this request and support for the Poles eroded fast. W≈Çadys≈Çaw was never able to take real power, and the war soon resumed. Sigismund and W≈Çadys≈Çaw left the city for safer ground as tensions grew, and the small Polish garrison at the Kremlin soon became isolated and subject to increased hostility, as more and more of the formerly pro-Polish boyars began to change factions. The Polish forces outside Moscow under the command of Jan Piotr Sapieha clashed with the growing anti-Polish Russian forces of the so-called First Volunteer Army, led by Prokopy Lyapunov. In the meantime, the siege of Smolensk continued, even as W≈Çadys≈Çaw was named tsar of Russia and cities and forts throughout the area swore allegiance to the Poles. However, Sigismund III required that Smolensk not only swear allegiance, but open its gates to the Poles, which the Russians refused to do. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski fortified Moscow with his army and returned to King Sigismund III, who had remained at Smolensk while ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski negotiated in Moscow. The largest tunneling project at Smolensk came in December 1610; however, the Poles only managed to destroy more of the outer wall ‚Äì the inner wall remained intact. The siege continued. At one point, the Polish guns breached the outer wall, and the governor of Braclaw (Brac≈Çaw) ordered his soldiers to rush in; however, the Russians had predicted where the breach would occur and had fortified that part of the wall with additional men. Both sets of troops were slaughtered, and the Poles were eventually beaten back. The war resumes (1611) Proclamation of Kuzma Minin, painting by Konstantin Makovsky A 1611 uprising in Moscow against the Polish garrison marked the end of Russian tolerance for the Commonwealth intervention. The citizens of Moscow had voluntarily participated in the coup in 1606, killing 500 Polish soldiers. Now, ruled by the Poles, they once again revolted. The Moscow burghers took over the munition store, but Polish troops defeated the first wave of attackers, and the fighting resulted in a large fire that consumed part of Moscow. From July onward the situation of the Commonwealth forces became grave, as the uprising turned into a siege of the Polish-held Kremlin. Reportedly, the Poles had imprisoned the leader of the Orthodox Church, Patriarch Hermogenes. When the Russians attacked Moscow, the Poles ordered him, as the man with the most authority with the Russians at the time, to sign a statement to call off the attack. Hermogenes refused and was starved to death. The Polish Kremlin garrison then found itself besieged. Patriarch Hermogenes refuses to sign a letter condemning anti-Polish actions, painting by Pavel Chistyakov In the meantime, in late 1611, prince Dmitry Pozharsky was asked to lead the public opposition against the Poles, organized by the merchants' guild of Nizhny Novgorod. The respected town butcher (literally, a meat-trader) Kuzma Minin oversaw the handling of funds donated by the merchants to form the Second Volunteer Army (). When part of the Polish army mutinied in January 1612 due to unpaid wages and retreated from Russia towards the Commonwealth, the forces of the Second Volunteer Army strengthened the other anti-Polish Russian forces in Moscow. The 9,000-strong Polish army under hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz attempted to lift the siege and clashed with Russian forces, attempting to break through to Polish forces in the Kremlin on 1 September. The Polish forces used cavalry attacks in the open field, exercising tactics that were new to them: escorting a mobile tabor fortress through the city. After early Polish successes, the Russian Cossack reinforcements had forced Chodkiewicz's forces to retreat from Moscow. Dmitry Pozharsky is asked to lead the volunteer army against the Poles, painting by Vasily Savinsky (1882) Russian reinforcements under prince Pozharsky eventually starved the Commonwealth garrison (there were reports of cannibalism) and forced its surrender on 1 November (though some sources give 6 November or 7 November) after the 19-month siege. A historian (Parker) writes vividly of the Polish soldiers: \\"First they ate grass and offal, then they ate each other, and the survivors finally surrendered. The Moscow Kremlin fell on 6 November 1612.\\" On 7 November, the Polish soldiers withdrew from Moscow. Although the Commonwealth negotiated a safe passage, the Russian forces massacred half of the former Kremlin garrison forces as they left the fortress.Tucker, S.C., Editor, 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, LLC, Thus, the Russian army recaptured Moscow. The Poles surrender the Moscow Kremlin to Prince Pozharsky in 1612, painting by Ernst Lissner On 2 June 1611 Smolensk had finally fallen to the Poles. After enduring 20 months of siege, two harsh winters and dwindling food supplies, the Russians in Smolensk finally reached their limit as the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian troops broke through the city gates. The Polish army, advised by the runaway traitor Andrei Dedishin, discovered a weakness in the fortress defenses, and on 13 June 1611 Cavalier of Malta Bart≈Çomiej Nowodworski inserted a mine into a sewer canal. The explosion created a large breach in the fortress walls. The fortress fell on the same day. The remaining 3,000 Russian defenders took refuge in the Assumption Cathedral and blew themselves up with stores of gunpowder to avoid death at the hands of the invaders. Although it was a blow to lose Smolensk, the defeat freed up Russian troops to fight the Commonwealth in Moscow, and the Russian commander at Smolensk, Mikhail Borisovich Shein, was considered a hero for holding out as long as he had. He was captured at Smolensk and remained a prisoner of Poland‚ÄìLithuania for the next nine years. A new respite (1612‚Äì1617) Mikhail Romanov finding out about his election to the Russian throne in the Ipatiev Monastery. Source: 17th century illustrated manuscript. After the fall of Smolensk, the Russo-Polish border remained relatively quiet for the next few years. However, no official treaty was signed. Sigismund, criticized by the Sejm (the Polish parliament made up of the szlachta, who were always reluctant to levy taxes upon themselves to pay for any military force) for his failure to keep Moscow, received little funding for the army. This led to a mutiny of the Polish regular army (wojsko kwarciane), or rather to the specific semi-legal form of mutiny practiced in the Commonwealth: a konfederacja (confederatio). The resulting konfederacja rohaczewska was considered the largest and most vicious of the soldiers' konfederacja's in the history of the Commonwealth, and it pillaged Commonwealth territories from 1612 until the most rebellious of the konfederate's were defeated on 17 May 1614 at the Battle of Rohatyn, whereupon the rest received their wages. The leader of the konfederacja, Jan Karwacki, was captured and sent in chains by the future hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski to his mentor, hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, and later executed in Lw√≥w. The Ottoman Empire further criticized Sigismund because the Cossacks in Ukraine once again had begun to make unsanctioned raids into Turkish territory. Thus, Poland‚ÄìLithuania got no support from the Ottoman Empire in its war. In the meantime, the Russian Time of Troubles was far from over, and Russia had no strength to take advantage of the Commonwealth's weakness. On 21 February 1613 the Zemsky Sobor (\\"assembly of the land\\") named Michael Romanov, now the 16-year-old son of Fyodor Romanov, the new tsar. Fyodor, now installed as Patriarch Filaret, was a popular boyar and patriarch of Moscow, one of several boyars who vied to gain control of the Russian throne during the Time of Troubles. The Romanovs were a powerful boyar family; Michael's great-aunt (the sister of his grandfather) was Anastasia Romanovna, the wife of Ivan the Terrible. However, the new tsar had many opponents. Marina Mniszech tried until her death in 1614 to install her child as Tsar of Russia; various boyar factions still vied for power, trying to unseat the young Tsar Michael; and Sweden intervened in force, trying to gain the throne for Duke Carl Philip, even succeeding for a few months. However, Philip received even less support than W≈Çadys≈Çaw, and the Swedes were soon forced to retreat from Russia. Relief of Smolensk by Polish forces, by Juliusz Kossak. While both countries were shaken by internal strife, many smaller factions thrived. Polish Lisowczycy mercenaries, who were essential in the defense of Smolensk in 1612, when most of regulars (wojsko kwarciane) mutinied and joined the konfederacja rohatynska, were content to guard the Polish border against the Russian incursions for the next three years. However, in 1615 Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski gathered many outlaws and invaded Russia with 6 chorƒÖgiew of cavalry. He besieged Bryansk and defeated the relief force of few thousand soldiers under Prince Yuri Shakhovskoy near Karachev. Then Lisowski defeated the front guard of a force several times larger than his own, under the command of knyaz Dmitry Pozharsky, who decided to defend instead of attack and fortified his forces in a camp. Lisowczycy broke contact with his forces, burned Belyov and Likhvin, took Peremyshl, turned north, defeated the Russian army at Rzhev, proceeded north towards Kashin, burned Torzhok, and returned to Poland heavy with loot without any further opposition from Russian forces. Lisowski and his forces remained at the Russo‚ÄìPolish border until autumn 1616, at which point Lisowski suddenly fell ill and died on 11 October. The formation was then known as Lisowczycy. Despite the death of Lisowski, his forces remained a significant threat: in 1616 they captured Kursk and defeated Russian forces at Bolkhov. The final stage (1617‚Äì1618) Jan Karol Chodkiewicz Eventually the Commonwealth Sejm voted to raise the funds necessary to resume large scale military operations. The final attempt by Sigismund and W≈Çadys≈Çaw to gain the throne was a new campaign launched on 6 April 1617. W≈Çadys≈Çaw was the nominal commander, but it was hetman Chodkiewicz who had actual control over the army. In October, the towns of Dorogobuzh (–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±—É–∂, Drohobu≈º, Drohobycz) and Vyazma (–í—è–∑—å–º–∞, Wia≈∫ma) surrendered quickly, recognizing W≈Çadys≈Çaw as the tsar. However, the Commonwealth forces met stubborn resistance near Mozhaisk, and Chodkiewicz's plans for a quick advance to Moscow failed. W≈Çadys≈Çaw did not have enough forces to advance to Moscow again, especially because the Russian support for the Poles was all but gone by that time. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny agreed to join the campaign against Tsardom of Russia. His army of Zaporozhian Cossacks invaded from the South, captured and sacked a number of towns, such as Livny, Yelets, Dankov etc. and headed for Moscow. The Russian army, opposing the Poles, retreated to Moscow and on 2 October Chodkiewicz and Sahaidachny together launched a siege of the Russian capital. However, their armies were not ready for a long siege and shortly after the night assault on October 10‚Äì11 failed, the siege was lifted. Negotiations began and a peace treaty was signed in December 1618. Aftermath Territories gained by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth marked in orange In the end, Sigismund did not succeed in becoming tsar or in securing the throne for W≈Çadys≈Çaw, but he was able to expand the Commonwealth's territory. During his reign Poland was the largest and most populous country in Europe. On 11 December 1618 the Truce of Deulino, which concluded the Dimitriad's war, gave the Commonwealth control over some of the conquered territories, including the territories of Chernigov and Severia (Siewiersk) and the city of Smolensk, and proclaimed a 15-year truce. W≈Çadys≈Çaw refused to relinquish his claim to the Russian throne, even though Sigismund had already done so. While the Commonwealth gained some territories in the east, in terms of finance and lives it was a very costly victory. In 1632 the Truce of Deulino expired, and hostilities immediately resumed in the course of a conflict known as the Smolensk War. This time the war was started by the Russians, who tried to exploit the suspected weakness of the Commonwealth after the unexpected death of Sigismund III. However, they failed to regain Smolensk. Mikhail Shein surrendered to W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV on 1 March 1634, and the Russians accepted the Treaty of Polyanovka in May 1634. The Russians had to pay 20,000 rubles to the Commonwealth, but W≈Çadys≈Çaw relinquished his claim to the Russian throne and recognized Michael as the legitimate tsar of Russia, also returning the Russian royal insignia. Modern legacy The Monument to Minin and Pozharsky stands before St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The story of the Dymitriads and False Dimitrys proved useful to future generations of rulers and politicians in Poland and Russia, and a distorted version of the real events gained much fame in Russia, as well as in Poland. In Poland the Dmitriads campaign is remembered as the height of the Polish Golden Age, the time Poles captured Moscow, something that even four million troops from Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers could not manage. In Russia it was useful to the new dynasty of tsars, the Romanovs, who understood that history is a powerful political tool, written by the victors. They tried to erase all references and theories to their role in creating the False Dmitrys, self-interested cooperation with Polish and Swedish interventions, or their opposition to the liberal unia troista; instead they supported a portrayal of Dmitriads as the heroic defense of Russian nation against the barbaric invasion of Polish‚ÄìJesuit alliance, who attempted to destroy the Russian Orthodox culture. This was the history line shown by the famous Russian historian, Nikolai Mikhailovich Karamzin, beautifully described by Aleksandr Pushkin in his \\"Boris Godunov\\" and by Modest Mussorgsky in his opera Boris Godunov, and later romanticized in the film Minin and Pozharsky by Vsevolod Pudovkin. The Monument to Minin and Pozharsky was erected in Moscow's Red Square in 1818. The communist regime of the Soviet Union also found this war a useful propaganda tool, especially during the times of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. The Dymitriads were also useful for the propaganda of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Polish government between the World Wars. In post-Soviet Russia the only autumn holiday, the National Unity Day, first celebrated on 4 November 2005, commemorates the popular uprising that ejected the occupying force from Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of the Time of Troubles and foreign interventions in Russia. Its name alludes to the idea that all the classes of the Russian society willingly united to preserve the Russian statehood when its demise seemed inevitable, even though there was neither Tsar nor Patriarch to guide them.

A bust is a sculpted or cast representation of the upper part of the human figure, depicting a person's head and neck, and a variable portion of the chest and shoulders. The piece is normally supported by a plinth. The bust is generally a portrait intended to record the appearance of an individual, but may sometimes represent a type. They may be of any medium used for sculpture, such as marble, bronze, terracotta, plaster, wax or wood. As a format that allows the most distinctive characteristics of an individual to be depicted with much less work, and therefore expense, and occupying far less space than a full-length statue, the bust has been since ancient times a popular style of life-size portrait sculpture. It can also be executed in weaker materials, such as terracotta. A sculpture that only includes the head, perhaps with the neck, is more strictly called a \\"head\\", but this distinction is not always observed. Display often involves an integral or separate display stand. The Adiyogi Shiva statue located in India representative of Hindu God Shiva is the world's largest bust sculpture and is 112 ft tall. Antiquity Sculptural portrait heads from classical antiquity, stopping at the neck, are sometimes displayed as busts. However, these are often fragments from full-body statues, or were created to be inserted into an existing body, a common Roman practice;Stewart, 47 these portrait heads are not included in this article. Equally, sculpted heads stopping at the neck are sometimes mistakenly called busts. The portrait bust was a Hellenistic Greek invention (although the Egyptian bust presented below precedes Hellenic productions by five centuries), though very few original Greek examples survive, as opposed to many Roman copies of them. There are four Roman copies as busts of Pericles with the Corinthian helmet, but the Greek original was a full-length bronze statue. They were very popular in Roman portraiture.Stewart, 46-47 The Roman tradition may have originated in the tradition of Roman patrician families keeping wax masks, perhaps death masks, of dead members, in the atrium of the family house. When another family member died, these were worn by people chosen for the appropriate build in procession at the funeral, in front of the propped-up body of the deceased, as an \\"astonished\\" Polybius reported, from his long stay in Rome beginning in 167 BC.Belting, 116-117 Later these seem to have been replaced or supplemented by sculptures. Possession of such imagines maiorum (\\"portraits of the ancestors\\") was a requirement for belonging to the Equestrian order.Belting, 116 Middle Ages Some reliquaries were formed as busts, notably the famous Bust of Charlemagne in gold, still in the Aachen Cathedral treasury, from c. 1350. Otherwise it was a rare format. Renaissance Busts began to be revived in a variety of materials, including painted terracotta or wood, and marble. Initially most were flat-bottomed, stopping slightly below the shoulders. Francesco Laurana, born in Dalmatia, but who worked in Italy and France, specialized in marble busts, mostly of women. Baroque The round-bottomed Roman style, including, or designed to be placed on, a socle (a short plinth or pedestal), became most common. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, based in Rome, did portrait busts of popes, cardinals, and foreign monarchs such as Louis XIV. His Bust of King Charles I of England (1638) is now lost; artist and subject never met, and Bernini worked from the triple portrait painted by Van Dyck, which was sent to Rome.

He became a fellow of the Royal Historical Society in April 1879 for being ‚Ä≥distinguished in letters‚Ä≥. Harris was born and raised in a two-bedroom cottage on the slopes of Bolenowe, a small hamlet near Camborne, Cornwall, in England. He was the eldest of nine children (six brothers and two sisters). At age twelve, he was sent to work at Dolcoath mine where he combined a life of painful labour with the production of poetry celebrating his native landscape around Carn Brea and the scenic splendours of Land's End and the Lizard. He could not afford pen and paper, so he improvised and used blackberry juice for ink and grocery bags for paper. In the 1840s, he married Jane Rule, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. When his second-born daughter, Lucretia, died during Christmas 1855, he produced a moving eulogy. After this a friend found him a more congenial occupation as a Bible-reader or travelling comforter at Falmouth, where he spent the second half of his life. During this period he produced his most important work, the loco-descriptive poem A Story of Carn Brea (1863). He received a grant of ¬£200 from the Royal Bounty Fund through the Earl of Beaconsfield and in September 1881 the prime minister gave him a grant of ¬£100 from the civil list. He died in 1884 having requested that he should be buried at Treslothan Chapel, near the village of Troon. There has been some revival of interest in his work, and recently, the book The Cornish Poet was brought out by the John Harris Society, containing his collected works.Everett, David (ed.)

It features Honor herself only in a cameo role: other characters from the novels and several short stories take centre stage. These include Captain Anton Zilwicki and his adopted daughter Berry, introduced in From the Highlands, and Ruth Winton, introduced in Promised Land. \\"Jeremy X\\", the terrorist leader of the Audubon Ballroom, and Victor Cachat, one of the Republic of Haven's most capable agents, also appear.  Plot summary  The novel continues the events that happened on From the Highlands, and is set over the background of the fight against genetic slavery. The story begins after the truce between Manticore and Haven. Captain Zilwicki, his adopted daughter Berry, Princess Ruth Winton and the slave-turned-professor W.E.B. Du Havel are sent as Queen Elizabeth III's (not the Manticoran government's) official representatives to the funeral of a notorious Solarian anti-slavery activist, which will take place in Erewhon, a disgruntled member of the Manticoran Alliance. Erewhon's location between Manticore, Haven and the Solarian League makes it a place where agents from the different star nations can play the intelligence game. From the first moment, Zilwicki, Berry and Ruth get entangled in a complex situation involving Havenite agents, ambitious Solarian Navy officers, violent Masadan mercenaries, the Audubon Ballroom and the powerful Mesan corporation Manpower Incorporated. Each faction has interests of its own, which collide with those of the others: the Manticorans want to salvage their relation with Erewhon (and upset the Prime Minister who allowed that relationship to sour). The Havenites intend to show support for the anti-slavery cause and improve their own relationship with Erewhon, with the unstated goal of breaking Erewhon away from Manticore. The Erewhonese want someone ‚Äî anyone ‚Äî to help them deal with a Mesan-owned planet which is a threat to their security. The Solarian officers work to further the interests of a powerful political patron who believes that the League is on the verge of collapse and wants to be prepared for that event. The Mesans want to stay out of the limelight and prevent all the other factions from attacking their major industry: slave trading, while the Audubon Ballroom simply wants to hit Mesa anywhere they can. And even the Masadan mercenaries employed by the Mesans have their own agenda: to force Manticore to free several of their imprisoned companions. The clash of interests comes to a head with an attempted kidnapping on Berry Zilwicki and Ruth Winton (who happens to be the sister of the leader of the Masadan mercenaries) aboard The Wages of Sin, Erewhon's main civilian space station. After Manpower's involvement is discovered, a haphazard alliance between the Manticorans, Solarians, Havenites and the Ballroom is organized to launch an attack on the Mesan-owned planet Verdant Vista, popularly known as \\"Congo\\". The planet is taken from Manpower's hands, and it is decided to transform it into an independent nation of its own for escaped slaves, so that the conflict against Mesa may have a nation sponsoring it. The novel ends with Berry Zilwicki being crowned as Berry I, Queen of the new Kingdom of Torch.

Set in the Honorverse, it has been billed as the first in the Saganami Island series, spun off from the main Honor Harrington series. The book debuted at #16 on The New York Times best seller list for hardcover fiction. It features Honor herself only in a cameo role: other characters from the novels and several short stories take centre stage. These include Helen Zilwicki, introduced in From the Highlands (after a cameo in The Short Victorious War), and Abigail Hearns, introduced in Ashes of Victory and also seen in The Service of the Sword. Plot summary The events of the novel are simultaneous with those of the novel At All Costs, which belongs to the main series of Honorverse novels. The story focuses on the shakedown cruise of the Edward Saganami-C-class heavy cruiser HMS Hexapuma (nicknamed Nasty Kitty), commanded by Captain Aivars Terekhov, a war veteran and former prisoner of war who has only recently been cleared for return to active naval service. To the surprise of her new captain and crew, the Hexapuma, one of the Royal Manticoran Navy's most modern and powerful cruisers, is assigned to the Talbott Cluster, an impoverished group of star systems recently incorporated within the Star Kingdom of Manticore, and facing a vote of annexation. With the renewal of brutal war with Haven, and embroiled in the annexation of parts of the Silesian Confederacy, Manticore has no choice (and no other available resources) but to assign a small and clearly insufficient naval force to guard the Cluster, while a Constitutional Convention is taking place which will define the terms of the Cluster's formal annexation. However, both the Solarian League's Office of Frontier Security (OFS) and corporations (which resents Manticore intervening in its \\"backyard\\") and the slaver world of Mesa do not want this to move forward and support indigenous groups violently opposed to annexation. The goal is to launch a terrorist campaign against Manticore, giving the League the excuse to intervene in the Cluster and expel the Star Kingdom. The annexation is also stalled by the ruling oligarchs of many of the Cluster's systems, who fear that their power, wealth and influence will dilute once their worlds are absorbed within the Star Kingdom. In addition, the annexation is viewed with some distrust by vocal sectors of the Cluster's population, as it was sponsored by a powerful local merchant cartel with a history of strong-arming and abuse for its own purposes. Hexapuma and her crew must patrol the Cluster's many systems to \\"show the flag\\" and assist the planetary governments, thus demonstrating Manticore's goodwill, while dealing politically with the various oligarchs and also supporting the convention efforts. On one side is Westman, a native of Montana, who manages to bomb several government facilities without causing a single casualty, and Nordbrant of Kornati, whose multi bomb attacks slaughter hundreds of civilians. Both groups are supplied by 'Firebrand', an intelligence officer of the OFS, who is attempting to destabilize the region so OFS forces can occupy the Cluster to \\"preserve regional peace.\\" Eventually, President Tonkovic of Kornati, leader of the Constitutional Convention and one of the main holdouts to maintain her personal power, is impeached by her own government after it comes to light that her stalling almost resulted in Kornati's removal from the annexation effort, and the annexation moves forward. Initially completely removed from the internal strife in order to avoid looking like invading oppressors, Hexapuma is tasked with pirate patrol. After stumbling across two pirate cruisers and a captured merchantman and tricking the cruisers into initiating the attack, she crushes the cruisers and manages to liberate the merchantman and its surviving crew, finding the pirates are former State Security personnel of the defunct Peoples Republic of Haven. The action cements Terekhov's abilities in the eyes of his crew and earns him copious goodwill from the people of the Talbott Cluster. In the course of Hexapuma's patrolling, evidence begins to pile up indicating that the local terrorists are actually the unwitting pawns of foreign interests. They then stumble across an armed freighter of Mesa's Jessyk Combine in the process of delivering weapons to Westman. When Hexapuma sends a pinnace over to perform an inspection, one of the freighter's crew members panics and destroys the pinnace. After being decimated by Hexapuma's missile-defense lasers in response to the destruction of the pinnace, the surviving crew of the freighter surrender and give up the majority of the OFS's plan to occupy the Cluster. After dealing with the local terrorist groups, Captain Terekhov and Hexapuma assemble an ad hoc squadron with other Manticoran ships in a mission to prevent the next step of the conspirators' plan: the service entry of a fleet of powerful ex-Solarian battlecruisers which have been transferred to Monica, an OFS proxy system to be used against Manticore. After dropping into the system, Terkhov demands the surrender of the local fleet until Manticore can validate the cruisers' authenticity, and that they're sovereign of Monica and not the OFS. Playing for time, the Monican Navy manages to lure the Manticoran Squadron into weapons range. After a brutal battle, half of Terekhovs squadron is destroyed or crippled, though the Monican Navy is destroyed in the process. After being relieved, and with the formal annexation well under way, Terekhov and Hexapuma return to Manticore and are greeted with a heroes welcome.

They captured and held peacekeepers from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and, in August 2000, captured a patrol of British soldiers from the Royal Irish Regiment and their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer. The group was subsequently destroyed in an operation by the Special Air Service and Parachute Regiment in September 2000 during Operation Barras. The group was influenced to some extent by American rap and gangsta rap music, especially Tupac Shakur, and the \\"gangsta\\" culture portrayed therein.Fofana, Lansana \\"SIERRA LEONE: Rap Star‚Äôs T-shirt A Major Factor In Conflict\\", Inter Press Service, October, 1998, retrieved 20 May 2018. Since the title 'West Side Niggaz' would have been an entirely unacceptable phrase to be regularly used on news programmes concerning the group, the title was amended to render it to the innocuous 'West Side Boys'. Prior to their destruction, the group's size had expanded to around 600 but later suffered about 200 defections. Many members of the group were child soldiers abducted after their parents had been killed by the \\"recruiters\\". Some of these children were forced to participate in torturing their parents to death in order to brutalise and dehumanise them. The West Side Boys were heavy users of poyo (homemade palm wine), locally grown marijuana, and heroin bought with conflict diamonds. Conflict diamonds were also used to purchase many of their weapons, which ranged from FN FAL/L1A1 rifles, AK-47/AKM rifles and RPG-7 grenade launchers to 81 mm mortars and ZPU-2 anti-aircraft guns. Most of their vehicles were hijacked from UN food convoys.  Description  At the time that the West Side Boys were active, large areas of Sierra Leone were controlled by militias. However, there existed no provable connections to the main rebel group in Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front. Frequently the subject of British media, due in part to their kidnapping of British soldiers and their flamboyant character, as reported by the BBC: \\"They were known for wearing bizarre clothing ‚Äì women's wigs and flip-flops were favourites ‚Äì and being almost perpetually drunk.\\" A 2008 article published in the Journal of Modern African Studies offers an alternative view of the West Side Boys as an effective military unit employing military and political techniques to achieve defined goals, as opposed to a criminal gang with no political purpose engendered by the perpetual lawlessness and social breakdown of the country.

It offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in approximately 78 areas of study. Anderson is affiliated with the South Carolina Baptist Convention and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.http://www.llr.state.sc.us/POL/Nursing/pdf/NursingPrograms/RNPrograms.pdf Anderson participates in NCAA Division II athletics and is a member of the South Atlantic Conference. Anderson was the 19th fastest growing private master‚Äôs university in the United States from 2006 to 2016, more than doubling its enrollment during the decade. Re-established in 1911 as Anderson College, it is the successor to Johnson University, which was founded in 1848 by local Baptist leaders. Anderson was initially a female college until 1931 when it became co-ed, and in 2006 it was re-styled Anderson University. It consists of nine distinct colleges and schools: South Carolina School of the Arts, Clamp Divinity School, Arts and Sciences, Business, Christian Studies, Education, Health Professions, Interior Design, and Public Service & Public Administration. In July 2020, Anderson announced that a new College of Engineering has been created. Pending pertinent accreditation approvals, it will offer bachelor programs in mechanical and electrical engineering, and will welcome its first class in fall 2021. History Johnson Female Seminary was established in 1848 at the present-day site of First Baptist Church of Anderson which is also an affiliate of Anderson University Origin Anderson University traces its heritage and initial founding to 1848 in the form of Johnson Female Seminary (later renamed Johnson University) which was located in Anderson, South Carolina. The seminary was founded by Anderson citizens Daniel Brown, J.P. Reed, and Stephen McCulley. Johnson Female Seminary was named for the Rev. William Bullein Johnson, an early Baptist statesman, a founder and first Vice President of the South Carolina Baptist Convention, and the first president of the Southern Baptist Convention. Johnson served as the first chancellor of Johnson University. By 1857 Johnson University had around 600 students taking courses in calculus, Latin, and Greek. In 1858 Johnson's health declined and in 1862 he passed away. Johnson's home still stands in Anderson and his portrait hangs in perpetuity in the Truett Cathy Old Common Room in Merritt Hall on the Anderson University campus. Johnson was buried in the cemetery of First Baptist Church of Anderson. The university closed its doors due to the combined impact of Rev. Johnson's untimely death and the onset of the Civil War. The main building of Johnson University became a Confederate treasury and printing press during the civil war until 1865 when Union forces occupied the building. After the war the Carolina Collegiate Institute and Patrick Military Institute used the buildings of the seminary for educational purposes until 1920. The buildings of Johnson University were then demolished around 1920. Anderson College Anderson College in 1911 Shortly after the turn of the century, those who fondly remembered the impact that Johnson University had on the region developed a compelling vision of resurrecting the institution in the form of Anderson College in 1911. The name Anderson comes from Robert Anderson an American Revolutionary War veteran and the namesake of Anderson, South Carolina. The Anderson Chamber of Commerce raised $100,000 and secured for the new campus. The land and funds were given to the South Carolina Baptist State Convention to establish the college. The Merritt Administration Building was the first building constructed on the land. For a time this was the only building dedicated to academics. It would eventually house only the president's office and the Merritt Theatre. At the outset there were financial problems until Dr. Annie Denmark became President in 1929. Denmark became the first female college president in South Carolina. Denmark's inauguration as President on February 14, 1929 established the tradition for Anderson College as Founder's Day celebrating the day of chartering the institution. In 1931 Anderson College became a co-educational junior college. In the 1990s Anderson returned to its status and offerings as a four-year institution. Anderson University In 2004, President Evans Whitaker led the campus and community to envision the university in new dimensions of impact and influence in the South. With strategic plans for mission expansion, academic innovation, and the initiation of graduate programs, Anderson College was re-styled Anderson University in 2006. On the occasion of the first commencement as Anderson University, S. Truett Cathy, founder of Chick-fil-A, and his son Dan Cathy received honorary degrees from Anderson University for exemplifying the character and vision Christian businessmen should possess. In June 2011 Anderson University became the host of the Palmetto Boys State. In 2012 Anderson University joined the University Center of Greenville (UCG) becoming the first educational institution in approximately 20 years to join. In 2013, Anderson University received a $143,000 grant from the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to duplicate the success of its groundbreaking MLI in South Carolina public schools. A new 60,000 square foot library was opened in 2006. Five new residence halls were constructed and a student townhome complex was acquired. A new 90,000 square foot student center was opened in fall 2016. Apple Distinguished School Anderson University launched an initiative in 2011 called the Mobile Learning Initiative or MLI, which has three times garnered recognition by Apple Inc. Apple Distinguished Schools are centers of leadership and educational excellence that demonstrate Apple's vision for learning and technology. Apple considers these schools some of the most innovative schools in the world. Apple technology is part of the fabric of the Anderson University learning experience. Chemistry, biology, and biochemistry students use digital microscopes and produce media. In the Coding and App Development minor developed with Apple, student teams use Swift and Xcode to develop applications that help solve real-world problems. Nursing students use iPads to receive performance assessments from faculty and to explore human anatomy through augmented reality. And the Graduate Nursing program students rely on iPad applications to present evidence-based case studies and video simulations and interactive forms of assessment. Campus Front view of Anderson University and the Merritt Administration Building Most of the buildings on the main campus are red brick, built throughout the 20th century in the Georgian architectural style. The Merritt Administration Building, Denmark Hall, and Pratt Hall were the original buildings on the Anderson University campus, being built at the time of the university's founding in 1911. One of the main educational facilities at the heart of campus, Watkins Hall, was dedicated in 1967. Other marked points of interest include the Sullivan Music Building, and the Abney Athletic Center. The front lawn is called \\"Alumni Lawn\\" (sometimes referred to as the \\"Sacred Six\\" acres) of Anderson University and is heavily wooded with large oak trees, as is the interior of the main campus which is landscaped in a series of rising terraces. Alumni Lawn and many early buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Anderson College Historic District. In 2008, the university purchased the nearby Anderson County Fairgrounds comprising 77 acres, and simultaneously accepted a gift of 125 adjacent acres on the Rocky River from benefactors John and Marie Pracht. These acquisitions quadrupled the campus acreage from 68 to 270. The Fairgrounds property is being transformed into the university's Athletic Campus. Facilities include a swimming pool, tennis center, softball stadium, soccer stadium, intramural gymnasium, and practice fields with plans for the addition of a baseball stadium, track, fitness center and field house, and athletic administration facility. The Pracht property includes 40 acres of healthy wetlands. Subsequently, the university joined with other wetlands property owners to form the Rocky River Conservancy. The combined properties are being developed into a protected ecological park with trails, boardwalks, and discovery center. The university has reserved a portion of the Pracht property uplands for future development. Thrift Library Anderson University created a special partnership in 2012 which operates within the former Duke Energy Service Center which is approximately one mile from the main campus and which was a partial gift to the university from the former Duke Energy Carolinas (now Duke Energy Progress). The facility is the home of the university's graduate program in criminal justice otherwise known as the Command College of South Carolina. The facility also houses undergraduate criminal justice programs. In 2013, the university acquired the first floor of the historic Chiquola building in downtown Anderson, less than a mile from the main campus. The 11,000 square foot facility is a multi-purpose space for the university's graphic design degree program, student activities, and a center for the study and practice of entrepreneurship. The facility features three storefront retail spaces in which student-initiated and run businesses will operate. The Anderson University year-round student population stands at approximately 3,848 students, with a student to faculty ratio of 17:1. About three thousand of those students are traditional undergrads, while the remainder are graduate students. Academics Johnston Hall College of Arts and Sciences Watkins Teaching Center Undergraduate programs under the College of Arts and Science consist of biochemistry, biology, communication, creative writing, English literature, history, liberal studies, mathematics, political science, psychology and Spanish. The program challenges students to critical thinking, communication, and rhetoric. The Center for Undergraduate Cancer Research is also part of the college and was established in 2009 to facilitate undergraduate research in search for a cure for cancers. Working under the direction of full-time faculty, students conduct studies and publish results. The Center is located on the nearby campus of AnMed Health Medical Center. College of Business The College of Business conducts undergraduate and graduate programs. Undergraduate programs consist of business administration, accounting, human resource administration, and marketing. Highly selective internships, most of which are paid, are required for undergraduate and graduate programs of at least 150 hours. The student business group called Enactus helps students practice skills learned from the College of Business to better the community. The University Center in Greenville consists of undergraduate and graduate degrees from South Carolina's top universities including Anderson University. The Anderson University MBA program is exclusively at the University Center. College of Christian Studies Undergraduate and graduate programs prepares ministers to preach the Gospel and have a concentration on youth ministry, pastoral ministry, or missions. The Clamp Divinity School was established in 2014 and offers four graduate degree programs: Master of Divinity, Master of Ministry, Doctor of Ministry in Biblical Preaching, and the Doctor of Ministry in 21st Century Leadership . The purpose of the Clamp school is to offer training in ministry in preparation for leading churches. The school is named after David T. Clamp who contributed an $8 million naming gift in 2008. College of Education The College of Education prepares students to become public educators with Judeo- Christian values. Undergraduate programs consists of early childhood education, elementary education and secondary education. Upon completion of the undergraduate program the teacher licensure can be initiated through South Carolina Department of Education. The graduate program in education prepares teachers to become principals or certified teachers. The Teaching Fellows program of the College of Education annually sends students to teach in China and host a storytelling event on campus. Up to $6,000 in annual scholarships are provided under the Teaching Fellows program for students planning to teach in South Carolina. Vandiver Hall Denmark Hall College of Engineering In 2020, the university's board of trustees established a college of engineering which will offer majors beginning fall 2021 in electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering. College of Health Professions The School of Nursing, School of Physical Therapy, School of Allied Health, and the School of Human Performance comprise the College of Health Professions. The schools offer undergraduate programs in nursing, kinesiology, and human services. Graduate programs are offered in nursing (MSN and DNP) and physical therapy (DPT). The Center for Medical Simulations offers realistic experience for students in nursing or physical therapy. The Center provides human-scale replicas of patients that simulate a variety of conditions. Johnny Mann Center for Commercial Music The Johnny Mann Center is the home of The South Carolina School of the Arts' degree program in commercial music. Commercial music at Anderson University includes pop, rock, jazz, bluegrass, and country music genres. The Center also serves as a library for a number of Mann's musical arrangements, compositions, and memorabilia. The Mann Center is named for the two-time Grammy Award-winning American arranger, composer, conductor, entertainer, and recording artist, Johnny Mann (John Russell Mann). As bandleader with the Johnny Mann Singers, the group recorded approximately three dozen albums, hosted the TV series titled Stand Up and Cheer (1971‚Äì1974), and was the musical director for The Joey Bishop Show. He was also musical director of The Alvin Show, and was the voice of Theodore. Mann was also choral director for the NBC Comedy Hour. The Johnny Mann Singers' cover version of \\"Up, Up and Away\\", rather than the hit version by The 5th Dimension, became the hit version of the song in the UK Singles Chart.name=\\"British Hit Singles & Albums\\" The version also won a Grammy Award in 1968 in the Best Performance by a Choir of Seven or More Persons category. In total, Mann was nominated for five Grammys, two of which he won. Mann and his wife, Betty, retired to Anderson, South Carolina in the early 2000s and immediately developed admiration for the University and a personal friendship with its president and wife. At the President's request, Mann wrote the University's Centennial Alma Mater, \\"The Sounds of Anderson.\\" In 2010, the University awarded Mann an honorary doctor of humanities degree. In April 2014 at the age of 85, he was a guest conductor of The South Carolina School of the Arts, at Anderson University's spring gala where he led the University choirs in performing the Johnny Mann Singers arrangement of \\"Up, Up and Away.\\" At the song's conclusion, the audience of about 1,000 stood in Mann's honor. It would be his last public performance. On June 18, 2014, Johnny Mann died at his home in Anderson. School of Interior Design The School of Interior Design is one of only nine such programs offered at Christian colleges and universities in the United States that offers a Bachelor of Interior Design. The undergraduate program prepares students to become a designer in many settings such as in an architectural firm or interior design firm. School of Public Service and Administration The School of Public Service and Administration educates law enforcement officers, private investigators, federal agents and prospective law students. The school also offers programs in emergency management. Undergraduate programs prepares students for the local, state and federal law enforcement, corrections and emergency response. The graduate program in criminal justice prepares those experienced in law enforcement to advance their careers into management or senior-executive positions with a commitment to Christian values.

The population in 2011 was 1,341,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 9.03 km¬≤.Eurostat It contains the localities Covoada, Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa and Pav√µes. History The parochial church, Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, dates back to the construction of a chapel in the 16th century by Captain Gaspar de Medeiros the Older (its cupola was paid for by the Santa Casa de Miserc√≥rdia of Ponta Delgada). During the early settlement of S√£o Miguel, from about 1846, this area pertained to the parish of Arrifes, passing to the territory of Relva later, until its numbers warranted the creation of a new entity. On March 2, 1958 the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda was destroyed in a violent fire; its retable and the image of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda were lost. In ashes of the temple, the residents were able to save a few books and documents, and an image of the Virgin Mary that was located in the baptistery. This image was transferred to the Seminary of Sr. Santo Cristo, in Ponta Delgada, where it today remains. During the reconstruction of the new church, in the latter part of the 20th century, the temple received a new bell tower. The Livro de Tombo from the Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda indicated the necessity to provide an independent religious parish to the faith community on October 28, 1977. It was de-annexed from Relva on September 15, 1980, under Regional Decree 24/80/A. Geography Covoada is a slender tract of land between the parishes of Relva and Arrifes that includes prime agricultural and pasturelands, interspersed with mountainous terrains covered in partial forest and scrub-brush. It is limited to an area from Capelas (in the north) to Relva and Arrifes (in the southwest and southeast respectively), and includes basin of the Serra Devassa, that includes Pico do Pa√∫l, Pico Am√™ndoa, Pico Roch√£o, Pico das Maias and the Ladeira do Ledo. The available land has allowed the development of agriculture; cattle and dairy farming are the primary industrial sectors.

Special routes are distinguished from main routes by, in most cases, the addition of an auxiliary plate that describes what type of route it is, while the main highway carries no such sign. In some locations, a single letter is placed after the route number to denote the special route type in lieu of the auxiliary plate. Among members of the roadgeek community, these routes are often called auxiliary or bannered U.S. Highways. There are four main types of special routes ‚Äî alternate, business, bypass, and temporary; though other route types exist. *Alternate routes exist where an additional road is needed to meet traffic demands. They are to be of equal character and quality compared to the main road. *Business routes carry traffic through the central business district of a community while the main highway goes around the community. *Bypasses serve the opposite purpose of business routes. Truck routes are a subset of bypasses. *Temporary routes complete a gap between two segments of main highway that exists because the main highway has not been fully constructed. A unique type of route in the U.S. Route system uses directional letter suffixes following the route number. These are known as divided U.S. Routes and are generally not considered to be special routes. The following U.S. Highway special routes have existed: * Routes are sorted by position along the main route, from south to north and west to east. * Defunct routes are listed in italics.

It belongs to Ovar Municipality. The population in 2011 was 11,448,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 9.17 km¬≤. Esmoriz was given city status in 1993.  Geography  The city is divided into 3 main sectors, the urban sector, the beach and the forest. However, the city is composed mainly of urban elements. The urban sector is home to mostly middle to upper-middle class families, and the most regular house types are Apartments, usually in 3-story apartment buildings. Small businesses are common, such as greengrocers and convenience stores spread throughout the city, but there are also large commercial infrastructures such as Pingo Doce, Continente, Minipre√ßo and Intermarch√©. Several bookstores and IT equipment shops are available, with the occasional barber shop and fashion store available. Despite the urbanized theme that characterizes Esmoriz, several green spaces are spread throughout the city. The forest sector is hardly inhabited and mostly constituted by pine woods. This area comprises half of the Bu√ßaquinho Environmental Park, shared with the neighboring town of Cortega√ßa. The beach sector of Esmoriz is a common touristic hotspot in the region during the summer, and encompasses the \\"Pinhal D'aberta\\", a mostly residential area that harbours the most luxurious houses and summer homes in the city.

There are 4 primary schools in Esmoriz: Escola da Relva, Torre, Praia, Vinha. The Florbela Espanca 2nd and 3rd cycle school was founded on 1 April 1975. For the first 13 years of it existence, the school was located at Rua do Solar dos Castanheiros (former summer home of poet Florbela Espanca. The building currently houses the local library). In 1988, the school moved to its current location in Rua Nova. The Esmoriz Secondary School was inaugurated in 1996 and currently provides schooling to students from 8th to 12th grade.

The BGS headquarters are in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, England. Its other centres are located in Edinburgh, Wallingford, Cardiff and London. The current motto of the BGS is: Gateway to the Earth.  History and previous names  The Geological Survey was founded in 1835 by the Board of Ordnance as the Ordnance Geological Survey, under Henry De la Beche. This was the world's first national geological survey. It remained a branch of the Ordnance Survey for many years. In 1965, it was merged with the Geological Museum and Overseas Geological Surveys, under the name of Institute of Geological Sciences. On 1 January 1984, the institute was renamed the British Geological Survey (and often referred to as the BGS), a name still carried today.  Competences  British Geological Survey roundel The BGS advises the British government on all aspects of geoscience, as well as providing impartial advice on geological matters to the public, academics and industry. BGS is a component body of UK Research and Innovation which \\"works in partnership with universities, research organisations, businesses, charities, and government to create the best possible environment for research and innovation to flourish\\". The core outputs of the BGS include geological, geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological maps, descriptions and related digital databases. Scientists at the BGS produced the first comprehensive map of African groundwater reserves. One of the key strategic aims for the next decade is to complete the transition from 2-D mapping to a 3-D modelling culture. The BGS has an annual budget of ¬£57 million, about half of which comes from the government's science budget, with the remainder coming from commissioned research from the public and private sectors.

On August 12, 1883, the astronomer Jos√© Bonilla reported that he saw more than 300 dark, unidentified objects crossing before the Sun while observing sunspot activity at Zacatecas Observatory in Mexico. He was able to take several photographs, exposing wet plates at 1/100 second. These represent the earliest photos of an unidentified flying object. It was later suggested that the objects were high-flying geese, while some ufological literature interpreted the objects as either alien spacecraft or an unsolved mystery. In 2011, researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico suggested that the unidentified objects may have been fragments of an estimated billion-ton comet passing within a few hundred kilometers of Earth.

Abad had excellent intelligence and was informed of Shields' movements by the local guerrillas ahead of time. In response, he assembled his entire force of around 180-250 regular Filipino soldiers and 1,000-2,000 bolomen, although some sources claim as few as 300 altogether. The regular Philippine soldiers were well organized and reasonably well armed with bolos, pistols, and Spanish Mausers, despite the fact that most were poor shots. The bolomen, armed only with machetes or bolos, served mainly to bolster Abad's forces. Dressed as friendly farmers or civilians in the daytime, they took part in guerrilla activities at night: ambushing small detachments of American soldiers, sabotage, and most importantly, supplying Abad with intelligence on American positions and movements. They had little military value, however, considering they had no firearms. Battle On September 13, Abad positioned his men along a steep ridge overlooking the trail which Shields would soon cross. Both Shields and his men had little combat experience and easily fell into the trap. Abad and his 250 soldiers opened fire on the column, which led to a fire-fight that lasted for several hours. Meanwhile, as the Americans and Philippine riflemen exchanged fire, the large force of Filipino bolomen began maneuvering to surround the Americans. Shields, seeing that he was almost completely surrounded, ordered a withdrawal, which soon turned into a full-blown retreat, as Abad's much larger force poured over the ridge after Shields and his men. The Filipino soldiers harassed Shields for nearly before cornering them in a small rice field; their escape to Santa Cruz was cut off by the large force of Filipino bolomen. Abad's men again opened fire, forcing the Americans to take cover behind some paddy dikes. Shields, wounded and recognizing the futility of the situation, raised the white flag in order to surrender. Men of the 29th volunteer infantry wading ashore on Marinduque April 25, 1900 After months of hiding, Abad in only a few hours eliminated nearly one third of the American garrison on Marinduque. Aftermath Shields' defeat sent shock waves through the American high command. Aside from being one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans during the war, it was especially significant given its proximity to the upcoming election between President William McKinley and his anti-imperialist opponent William Jennings Bryan, the outcome of which many believed would determine the ultimate course of the war. Consequently, the defeat triggered a sharp response. Arthur MacArthur, Jr. sent Brig. Gen. Luther Hare with \\"orders to treat the entire male population over fifteen as potential enemies and to arrest as many as possible and hold them hostages until Abad surrendered.\\" Hare secured the release of Shields and his men. Maj. Frederick A. Smith continued the policy of destroying food and shelter in the interior of the island, and moving all civilians into the towns. Although Abad and most of his command continued to elude the American military, the civilian population was suffering for it, with many landowners and merchants joining the Federal Party, turning against Abad. These new tactics led to the surrender of Abad in April 1901.

This term was initially used in military medicine (such as the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital or MASH), but it is inherited to be used in civil situations such as disasters and major incidents. A field hospital is a medical staff with a mobile medical kit and, often, a wide tent-like shelter (at times an inflatable structure in modern usage) so that it can be readily set up near the source of casualties. In an urban environment, the field hospital is often established in an easily accessible and highly visible building (such as a manor house, restaurant, school, and so on). In the case of an airborne structure, the mobile medical kit is often placed in a normalized container; the container itself is then used as shelter. A field hospital is generally larger than a temporary aid station but smaller than a permanent military hospital. International humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions, include prohibitions on attacking doctors, ambulances, hospital ships, or field hospitals buildings displaying a Red Cross, a Red Crescent or other emblem related to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  By country   France  Field hospitals in France are managed by the SAMU (French emergency medical service). Two types of mobile medical kits (poste sanitaire mobile or PSM) are used: * The level one mobile medical kit (PSM1): it can handle 25 heavy casualties on any type of ground; it is made of about 400 kg of equipment and drugs placed in 10 tanks, with also logistic equipment (trailer, inflatable tent, lighting, generating unit); there are 42 PSM1 in France; * The level two mobile medical kit (PSM2): it can handle resuscitation care for 500 patients; it is made of 8 tons of equipment and drugs (200 references) in 150 tanks, it can be divided ( is possible to set up several sub-fracedPSM2); in addition to the usual logistic equipment of the PSM1, the PSM2 has a tactical radio network and a management computer system. There are 21 PSM2 in France. The PSM are stored in the hospitals where there are samus and smurs. The PMA is organized in four zones: * a reception and triage zone, under the responsibility of a sort physician; the casualties are sorted and dispatched according to the seriousness of their state; * two zones for medical care: ** Absolute emergencies zone (UA: urgences absolues): prehospital resuscitation unit for very serious cases: extreme emergencies (EU: extr√®me urgence) and grave injuries (U1); ** Relative emergencies zone (UR: urgences relatives): for the serious (U2) and light injured (U3) * Mortuary zone (d√©pot mortuaire) for the deceased casualties. This zone is under the responsibility of the judicial police. In case of really massive disaster, it is possible to have several PMA; the evacuation goes then not directly to a hospital, but to another big field hospital called \\"medical evacuation centre\\" (centre m√©dical d'√©vacuation, CME), to avoid the saturation of the hospitals. In case of a red plan, the PMA is under the responsibility of a physician chosen by the director of medical rescue (DSM), and he is assisted by a firefighter officer chosen by the commander of rescue operation (COS). The firefighter officer has in charge the identification of the living casualties and of the secretaryship. The aim of the PMA is to sort and stabilize the casualties before their evacuation to a hospital. A similar system can be set up as a preventive measure for some very big events (sport championship, cultural events, concert...), but managed by first aid associations. It is then called an \\"associative medical post\\" (poste associatif m√©dicalis√©, PAM). (For smaller events, is simple first aid post, with only volunteer certified first responders and no medical staff, is set up.) The civil defence military units (Unit√© d'instruction et d'intervention de la s√©curit√© civile, UIISC) have airborne field hospitals. The general system is called DICA (d√©tachement d'intervention de catastrophe a√©roport√©, i.e. airborne disaster unit), and is specialized in search-and-rescue and in emergency medicine; it can be enhanced by the Fast civil defence medical unit, called ESCRIM (√©l√©ment de s√©curit√© civile rapide d'intervention m√©dicale). The ESCRIM is a surgical unit (detachement d'appui chirurgical) assisted by a medical assistance unit (DAMHo, d√©tachement d'appui m√©dical et d'hospitalisation); the later is specialized in pre- and post-operation care, and allows 48h of hospitalization. The UIISC also has a PMA (i.e. sort, stabilization and evacuation structure) when the hospital infrastructure of the country is sufficient. Namibia The Namibian Defence Force operates a mobile field hospital through its Defence Health Services Directorate. It was donated by the German government to Namibia in March 2013. Initially it was a UN level two hospital but has now been upgraded to level one. The field hospital is containerized in tents, it has capacity to treat forty outpatients per day and can admission capacity of twenty patients. It has two intensive care units, laboratories, an X-ray unit and a mobile oxygen concentrator. The dental department can treat 20 and four operations can be carried out daily. It has its own mobile logistics support wing consisting of kitchens, water purifiers, water tanks, toilet and shower containers, generators and sewage and refuse disposal facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic the hospital was deployed to Hosea Kutako International Airport to aid the country's response.  United States  Field hospitals were originally called ambulances. Field hospital after the Battle of Savage's Station (1862) Italian Army field hospital on the Italian Front during World War I The surgical, evacuation, or field hospitals would remain many miles in the rear, and the divisional clearing stations were never intended to provide emergency life-saving surgery. With the Army's larger mobile hospitals unable to assume their traditional role in support of the front line combat units, the chain of evacuation was interrupted at a critical point. Some sort of interim solution had to be found quickly to provide the necessary surgical services and care to the severely wounded directly behind the front lines. Otherwise, many wounded soldiers would die from either the lack of life-saving surgery at the front or from the long and arduous evacuation trek along jungle trails from the frontal clearing stations to the nearest surgical unit. Manned with skilled surgeons and located close to the fighting to render quick, life-saving surgical intervention, the portable hospital could be moved by its own personnel to remain with the infantrymen during fluid operations. = 20th century = A team of Medical Corps officers modified the basic War Department for a standard 25-bed station hospital into a new theater and table of basic for a portable hospital of 25-beds. The new unit was capable of supporting small units in its camp-type version (with 4 female Army nurses and organic vehicles) or battalion and regimental combat teams in its task force version (without the 4 nurses and organic vehicles). Commanded by a Medical Corps captain or major, the new 29-man portable hospital had 4 medical officers, 3 general surgeons, and 25 enlisted men, including 2 surgical and 11 medical technicians. What really marked a radical departure was that all of the unit's equipment, medical and surgical supplies, and rations could weigh no more than the 29 men could personally transport. Because the surgical demands on the theater's hospitals were then only minimal, a large number of trained surgeons were available in Australia to man the new units. The surgeons in many of the initial portable hospitals would set standards of excellence in surgery and care that firmly established the reputation of the portable hospitals throughout the theater. However, this was not true of all of the units, and in some instances hospital commanders took advantage of this opportunity to unburden themselves of their unproductive and less well qualified surgeons. Hastily assembled and trained, the portable hospitals suffered from many shortcomings in personnel and equipment, which would soon become obvious in the jungle fighting around Buna. Probably the single most critical problem was the severe limitation placed on the total weight to assure the unit's portability. From the start, this meant that to be portable the unit had to give up medical and surgical equipment and supplies that would have been most useful in the field. Another handicap was the lack of a coherent doctrine for the tactical employment of the portable hospitals, along with an explanation of their exact role in the chain of treatment and evacuation within the combat zone. The Chief Surgeon's Office promulgated a basic doctrine in September 1942 when the portable hospitals were established, but that doctrine went to the base sections in Australia and the portable hospitals and not to the medical units or surgeons in the Advanced Base in Papua and combat units. With no actual operational experience as a basis, that doctrine was much more conjectural than concrete. The Surgeon General's Office and the War Department enthusiastically adopted SWPA's new hospital as a regular unit before the first portable hospitals proved their value in the Buna campaign. The Surgeon General sought and received approval to add 48 of the new portable hospitals to the War Department's troop basis for 1943. Based on what was learned at Buna. By the end of 1943, the 48 new units were activated, two of which were assigned to SWPA. Another 15 new units would arrive in the theater during 1944 to support the increasing pace of MacArthur's offensive operations along the northern coast of New Guinea and into the Philippines. One portable surgical hospital was now allocated per infantry regiment, 3 per division, although additional hospitals were often authorized in larger operations. During the war, a total of 103 portable surgical hospitals were activated and 78 would serve in various theaters around the world through end of the war‚Äî19 in the China-Burma-India, China, or India-Burma theaters; 12 in the Pacific Ocean Area's South and Central Pacific theaters; and 51 in SWPA (4 moved to SWPA from the South Pacific during 1944). Six PSHs were assigned to the European Theater of Operations, but they arrived only after the end of hostilities. Thus, Carroll's temporary innovation gained significance far beyond SWPA, and the life-saving surgical work performed in all of these hospitals during the war saved the lives of many thousands of critically wounded soldiers and airmen. While equipment was always a critical concern, it was the skill level of the surgeons that most concerned the surgical consultants of the Sixth and Eighth U.S. Armies in SWPA. They saw as one of their primary functions the selection of the surgeons for the portable surgical hospitals. As the war dragged on into 1944, the pool of skilled and experienced surgeons that they could draw on in SWPA shrank as demands rapidly increased for such personnel. Increasingly, the portable surgical hospitals were manned with younger and less skilled surgeons.  Switzerland  Swiss Army with field hospital in cargo module. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Swiss Armed Forces were mobilised to support civil hospitals in Switzerland. Similar measures were taken in other countries.

Rose Garden is primarily characterized by historic residences, but it is also home to several cultural institutions, including the San Jose Rose Garden (for which the area is named) and Rosicrucian Park, which includes the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum  History  The neighborhood surrounds and is named for the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden, a 5¬Ω acre (22,000 m¬≤) park with thousands of rose bushes. Rosicrucian Park Planetarium. The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum. The Rose Garden is of one of San Jose's oldest neighborhoods outside of the 18th and 19th century downtown core around the Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe. Several existing Victorian houses in the neighborhood date from the 1860s and 1870s, especially along Magnolia Street, Hester Street, and Hedding Street. One of the oldest subdivisions of San Jose is the 1877 Chapman & Davis tract, which spans roughly 3x8 city blocks lying to the west of the San Jose and Santa Clara Railroad along The Alameda. This was the first interurban railroad in California when it opened with horsecars in 1868, the second electric streetcar line in California (after one in San Diego), and the first interurban electric streetcar in the West when it reopened in 1888 with an underground third rail. It was converted to an overhead trolley in 1889. Each residential lot was originally one-half acre, but most have been subdivided further since. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, The Alameda attracted many wealthy residents who built mansions along it. The Dunne mansion on the corner of Emory Street, built in the 1890s, may be the oldest building on the street. In 1927, what is now the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden and its immediate surroundings were primarily pear and prune orchards, many owned by Food Machinery Corporation (FMC). The area was also home to farm houses and a few mansions. In that year, the City purchased an 11-acre (45,000 m¬≤) prune garden and converted part of it into the Municipal Rose Garden. In 1937, John Crummey, the chairman of FMC, subdivided his 25-acre (100,000 m¬≤) pear orchard into residential lots sold for $5,00 each. This initial development established the core of the neighborhood called Rose Park. The neighborhood has preserved its residential housing. The original architecture of the 1920s and 1930s borrowed bits from the English Cotswold Cottage, Norman and Tudor design. Many of the original bungalows have been extensively remodeled or torn down and replaced with newer architectural styles. Education Lincoln High School, a National Blue Ribbon school.

Early life Nezhmetdinov was born in Aktubinsk, Russian Empire, in what is now Aktobe, Kazakhstan, in a Tatar family. His parents died when he was very young, leaving him and two other siblings to be raised by their brother. The orphaned, impoverished family moved to Kazan, Tatar ASSR. Nezhmetdinov had a natural talent for both chess and checkers. He learned chess by watching others play at a chess club, whereupon he challenged one of the players, won, and then challenged another player, winning that game as well. At 15, he played in Kazan's Tournament of Pioneers, winning all 15 games. He also learned to play checkers at this time. During the same month in which he learned the game, he won Kazan's checkers semi-final and placed second in the finals. In the same year, he placed sixth in the Russian Checkers Championship. He later won the Russian Checkers Championship at least once. Later, however, he gave up checkers for chess. Checkers  During World War II, Nezhmetdinov served in the military, thus delaying the further progress of his chess career until 1946. In 1949, the Russian Checkers Semifinals were held in Kazan. Nezhmetdinov attended as a spectator, but when one of the participants failed to show up, Nezhmetdinov agreed to substitute for him even though he hadn't played checkers for 15 years. He won every game, qualifying him for the Finals, which were to be held immediately after a chess tournament in which he was also participating. He won the tournament and immediately thereafter placed second in the Russian Checkers Championship.  Chess career   Playing style  Nezhmetdinov was a fierce, imaginative, attacking player who beat many of the best players in the world. Known for his committal, aggressive, forward moving playstyle, he is occasionally referred to by the nickname, \\"No Reverse Gear\\" Rashid.  Russian Championship  Nezhmetdinov got the historical record of five wins of the Russian Chess Championship, 1950, 1951, 1953, 1957 and 1958.  International Master title  FIDE awarded him the International Master title for his second-place finish behind Viktor Korchnoi at Bucharest 1954, the only time he was able to compete outside of the Soviet Union. Despite his extraordinary talent, he never was able to obtain the grandmaster title. Grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, a strong positional and endgame player, suggested a possible reason for this in his interview by Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam in The Day Kasparov Quit: > Nezhmetdinov, ... if he had the attack, could kill anybody, including Tal. > But my score against him was something like 8¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω because I did not give him > any possibility for an active game. In such cases he would immediately start > to spoil his position because he was looking for complications.  Results against world champions  Nezhmetdinov won a number of games against world champions such as Mikhail Tal, against whom he had a lifetime plus score, and Boris Spassky. He also had success against other world-class grandmasters such as David Bronstein, Lev Polugaevsky, and Efim Geller. He achieved a plus score in the 20 games he contested against World Champions. But in addition to his aforementioned dismal score against Averbakh, he could only score +0‚àí3=2 against excellent defenders like Tigran PetrosianNezhmetdinov-Petrosian games. ChessGames.com.

It is the seat of the Canton of Calvi, which contains Calvi and one other commune, Lumio. Calvi is also the capital of the Arrondissement of Calvi, which contains, besides the Canton of Calvi, three other cantons: L'√éle-Rousse, Belgod√®re, and Calenzana..

Les citadelles urbaines en Corse : patrimonialisatin d'un territoire particulier. Revue Etudes Carib√©ennes, n¬∞26, According to legend, Christopher Columbus supposedly came from Calvi, which at the time was part of the Genoese Empire. Because the often subversive elements of the island gave its inhabitants a bad reputation, he would have been expected to mask his exact birthplace.  Geography  465px Calvi is located on the northwest coast of the island of Corsica, from Bastia and from L'√éle- Rousse. It is the fifth-largest commune in Corsica; however, the arrondissement is the smallest. Climate History The motto, \\"Calvi semper fidelis\\" (\\"Calvi Always Faithful\\"), referred originally to its loyalty to the Republic of Genoa. The republic instated there a closed city centre (pr√©side) in 1278, and built a new castle in 1491 to face new artillery technologies. During the war with Revolutionary France, British forces under Admiral Nelson and Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart captured the city in the Siege of Calvi. It was during the bombardment of Calvi that Nelson sustained the injury that cost him his eye. Population Economy Port of Calvi The economy of Calvi is essentially based on summer tourism, which started in 1950 due to the pioneering efforts of Vladimir Raitz. Calvi is served by the international Calvi - Sainte- Catherine Airport, the Xavier Colonna Port, and a railway line to L'√éle-Rousse and Ponte-Leccia, where it connects with the main line Ajaccio - Bastia.

David Kapp founded his own label after stints with Decca and RCA Victor. Kapp licensed its records to London Records for release in the UK. In 1967, David Kapp sold his label to MCA Inc. and the label was placed under Uni Records management; Kapp was consolidated with MCA's other record labels in 1971 and, in 1973, MCA Records released the last Kapp record. Catalogue albums that continued to sell were renumbered and reissued on the MCA label. Kapp's subsidiaries included Medallion Records (an audiophile label), Congress Records, Leader Records, and Four Corners Records with its \\"4 Corners of the World\\" logo. Four Corners was formed to promote European artists, such as Fran√ßoise Hardy, Raymond Lef√®vre, and the Barclay Singers.

After the Renaissance of the 12th century, medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600 and other major historians of technology have also noted it. The period saw major technological advances, including the adoption of gunpowder, the invention of vertical windmills, spectacles, mechanical clocks, and greatly improved water mills, building techniques (Gothic architecture, medieval castles), and agriculture in general (three-field crop rotation). The development of water mills from their ancient origins was impressive, and extended from agriculture to sawmills both for timber and stone. By the time of the Domesday Book, most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in England alone. Water-power was also widely used in mining for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering bellows. European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from Roman and Byzantine antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the Islamic world, China, and India. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though gunpowder along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era. Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted ships with lateen sails, the sternpost-mounted rudder and the skeleton-first hull construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the dry compass, the Jacob's staff and the astrolabe, these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning Age of Exploration. At the turn to the Renaissance, Gutenberg‚Äôs invention of mechanical printing made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers Guido da Vigevano and Villard de Honnecourt can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance artist-engineers such as Taccola or da Vinci.  Civil technologies  The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).  Agriculture  Carruca (6th to 9th centuries) Carruca (Heavy Plough ) A type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe. The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a coulter at the bottom of the plough. This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the plowshare to work. The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below. The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward. The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer. This type of plough eliminated the need for cross- plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward. This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels. A disadvantage to this type of plough was its poor maneuverability. Since this equipment was large and led by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming. This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency. Ard (plough) (5th century) Medieval plough and oxen team While ploughs have been used since ancient times, during the medieval period plough technology improved rapidly. The medieval plough, constructed from wooden beams, could be yoked to either humans or a team of oxen and pulled through any type of terrain. This allowed for faster clearing of forest lands for agriculture in parts of Northern Europe where the soil contained rocks and dense tree roots. With more food being produced, more people were able to live in these areas. Horse collar (6th to 9th centuries) Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the yoke became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture. The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness. These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place. The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation. Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking. The rigid collar was \\"placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders. This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it.\\" Horseshoes (9th century) Medieval horseshoe While horses are already able to travel on all terrain without a protective covering on the hooves, horseshoes allowed horses to travel faster along the more difficult terrains. The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century. Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves. Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular. The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing. The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot. By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves. The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the Middle Ages. In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound. Crop rotation Two-field system (8th century) Crop rotation involved farmers to plant half of the field with a crop while the other half would be fallowed for the season. This was also called the two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops. One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients. Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient. In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming. The system of crop rotation is still used today by many farmers, who will grow corn one year in a field and will then grow beans or other legumes in the field the next year, this system is how farmers allow for nutrients to be replenished in the soil. Three-field system (11th century) While the two-field system was used by medieval farmers, there was also a different system that was being developed at the same time. Around each village in medieval Europe there were three fields that could be used to grow food. One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock. By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops. This system increases agricultural productivity over the two-field system by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half. Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%. Wine press (12th century) An authentic wine press that was actually used in the medieval period to crush grapes. The act of making wine was people stepping on grapes inside of a box and then draining the fruit juice and allowing the fermentation process to begin. During the medieval period the wine press had been constantly evolving into a more modern and efficient machine that would give wine makers more wine with less work. This device was the first practical means of Pressing (wine) on a plane surface. The wine press was made of a giant wooden basket that was bound together by wooden or metal rings that held the basket together. At the top of the basket was a large disc that would depress the contents in the basket crushing the grapes and making the juice to be fermented. The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford. The method of Grape stomping was often used as a less expensive alternative. While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter. Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins. Qanat (water ducts) (5th century) A medieval aqueduct unearthed Ancient and medieval civilizations needed and used water to grow the human population as well as to partake in daily activities. One of the ways that ancient and medieval people gained access to water was through qanats, which were a water duct system that would bring water from an underground source or river source to villages or cities. A qanat is a tunnel that is just big enough that a single digger could travel through the tunnel and find the source of water as well as allow for water to travel through the duct system to farm land or villages for irrigation or drinking purposes. These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an aquifer or water well. This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find. Qanats were very helpful in not losing water while being transported as well. The most famous water duct system was the Roman aqueduct system, and medieval inventors used the aqueduct system as a blueprint to make getting water to villages quicker and easier, then diverting rivers. After aqueducts and qanats many other water based technology was created and used in medieval periods including water mills, dams, wells and other such technology for easy access to water.  Architecture and construction  Pendentive architecture (6th century) A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 3rd century, it wasn't until the 6th century in the Byzantine Empire that its full potential was achieved. Artesian well (1126) A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126. Central heating through underfloor channels (9th century) In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman hypocaust at some places. In Reichenau Abbey a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m2 large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%. Rib vault (12th century) An essential element for the rise of Gothic architecture, rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older groin vault. Chimney (12th century) The first basic chimney appeared in a Swiss monastery in 820. The earliest true chimney did not appear until the 12th century, with the fireplace appearing at the same time. Segmental arch bridge (1345) The Ponte Vecchio in Florence is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge since the end of classical civilizations. Treadwheel crane Treadwheel crane (1220s) The earliest reference to a treadwheel in archival literature is in France about 1225, followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240. Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes. Stationary harbour crane (1244) Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244. The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating. These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340. Floating crane Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century. Mast crane Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gda≈Ñsk, Cologne and Bremen. Wheelbarrow (1170s) The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by Matthew Paris in the mid-13th century.  Art  Portrait of a Man in a Turban, oil painting by Jan van Eyck (1433) Oil paint (by 1125) As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck developed the use of a stable oil mixture for panel painting around 1410.Giorgio Vasari and Karel van Mander propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but Theophilus (Roger of Helmarshausen?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, On Divers Arts. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, wet-on-wet and other techniques.  Clocks  Hourglass (1338) Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a clepsydra, the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in Siena, Italy). Mechanical clocks (13th to 14th centuries) A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.  Mechanics  Compound crank The Italian physician Guido da Vigevano combines in his 1335 Texaurus, a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and paddle wheel boats. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.;  Metallurgy  Blast furnace (1150‚Äì1350) Cast iron had been made in China since before the 4th century BC. European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, D√ºrstel in Switzerland and the M√§rkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe in some places according to recent research even before 1100.Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen. \\"Die Entwicklung der Eisenverh√ºttung\\", 9.-14. Jh., in: Uta Lindgren (ed.): Europ√§ische Technik im Mittelalter. 800-1400, Berlin 2001 (4th ed.), pp. 249-256 (255) The technique is considered to be an independent European development.Karl-Heinz Ludwig, Volker Schmidtchen: Propyl√§en Technikgeschichte. Metalle und Macht 1000-1600, Berlin 1997, p.389f.  Milling  Ship mill (6th century) The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800. Paper mill (13th century) The first certain use of a water-powered paper mill, evidence for which is elusive in both ChineseTsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68‚àí73 and Muslim paper making,; dates to 1282. Rolling mill (15th century) Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as lead, gold and tin. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron. Tidal Mills (6th century) The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main waterwheel types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near Waterford was powered by a vertical waterwheel, while the tide changes at Little Island were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it. Another early example is the Nendrum Monastery mill from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight horsepower at its peak.Nendrum Monastery mill Vertical windmills (1180s) Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century. Water hammer (12th century at the latest) Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from bloomeries and Catalan forges, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by steam hammers in the 19th century.  Navigation  Dry compass (12th century) The first European mention of the directional compass is in Alexander Neckam's On the Natures of Things, written in Paris around 1190.Barbara M. Kreutz, \\"Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368 It was either transmitted from China or the Arabs or an independent European innovation. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.Frederic C. Lane, \\"The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,\\" The American Historical Review, Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff. Astronomical compass (1269) The French scholar Pierre de Maricourt describes in his experimental study Epistola de magnete (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation. Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder Stern-mounted rudders (1180s) The first depiction of a pintle- and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with cogs in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the age of discovery and thereafter.Lawrence V. Mott, The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale, Thesis May 1991, Texas A&M; University  Printing, paper and reading  Movable type printing press (1440s) Johannes Gutenberg's great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in woodblock printing, he used separate letters (types) from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster. Paper (13th century) Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see paper mill). Rotating bookmark (13th century) A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text. Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper. Reading Saint Peter with eyeglasses (1466) Spectacles (1280s) The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century. Watermark (1282) This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in Bologna, Italy.  Science and learning  Theory of impetus (6th century) A scientific theory that was introduced by John Philoponus who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the Scientific Revolution, extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of inertia, momentum and acceleration in classical mechanics. The first extant treatise of magnetism (13th century) The first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets was done by Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt when he wrote Epistola de magnete. Arabic numerals (13th century) The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by Fibonacci with his Liber Abaci. University The first medieval universities were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the Scientific Revolution. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.  Textile industry and garments  Functional button (13th century) German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.Lynn White: \\"The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences\\", Technology and Culture, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. & 500) They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing. Horizontal loom (11th century) Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient. Silk (6th century) Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the Silk Road since antiquity. The technology of \\"silk throwing\\" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills. Spinning wheel (13th century) Brought to Europe probably from India.  Miscellaneous  Knights Templar playing chess, Libro de los juegos (1283) Chess (1450) The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century. Forest glass (c. 1000) This type of glass uses wood ash and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours. Grindstones (834) Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the Utrecht Psalter, illustrated between 816 and 834. According to H√§germann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript. A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the Luttrell Psalter from around 1340. Liquor (12th century) Primitive forms of distillation were known to the Babylonians, as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.Irfan Habib (2011), Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500, page 55, Pearson Education Early evidence of distillation also comes from alchemists working in Alexandria, Roman Egypt, in the 1st century. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation process, which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in Salerno and Cologne in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death. These spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal elixirs. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the \\"national\\" drinks of Europe, including gin (England) and grappa (Italy). In 1437, \\"burned water\\" (brandy) was mentioned in the records of the County of Katzenelnbogen in Germany.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com, Trinkglas. Magnets (12th century) Magnets were first referenced in the Roman d'En√©as, composed between 1155 and 1160. Mirrors (1180) The first mention of a \\"glass\\" mirror is in 1180 by Alexander Neckham who said \\"Take away the lead which is behind the glass and there will be no image of the one looking in.\\" Illustrated surgical atlas (1345) Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 ‚àí 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His Anathomia provides pictures of neuroanatomical structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of trephination, and depictions of the meninges, cerebrum, and spinal cord. Quarantine (1377) Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the Republic of Ragusa as a measure of disease prevention related to the Black Death. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe. Rat traps (1170s) The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion by Chr√©tien de Troyes.  Military technologies   Armour  Quilted Armour (pre 5th - 14th Century) There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour. Cuir Bouilli (5th-10th Century) Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard. Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons. Banded Mail Armour Construction Chain Mail (11th-16th Century) The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the Hauberk, also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie. Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century banded mail became popular. Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks. Jazerant (11th century) The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour. Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. Scale Armour (12th century) A type of Lamellar armour, was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. Maximilian I in 1494 Plate Armour (14th century) Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows, the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. Components of medieval armour that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common. By the mid 1400s most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk. Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.  Cavalry  Arched saddle (11th century) The arched saddle enabled mounted knights to wield lances underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock cavalry, enabling fighters to charge on full gallop. Spurs (11th century) Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to \\"earn his spurs\\" by proving his or her worthiness. Stirrup (6th century) Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.  Gunpowder weapons  Cannon (1324) Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 Petrarch wrote \\"these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as kinds of arms.\\" Volley gun See Ribauldequin. Corned gunpowder (late 14th century) First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare. Scottish bombard Mons Meg very large-calibre cannon (late 14th century) Extant examples include the wrought-iron Pumhart von Steyr, Dulle Griet and Mons Meg as well as the cast-bronze Faule Mette and Faule Grete (all from the 15th century).  Mechanical artillery  Counterweight trebuchet (12th century) Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the Byzantine Empire around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the Crusader states and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.Paul E. Chevedden, \\"The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)  Missile weapons  Greek fire (7th century) An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines, where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the Umayyad Caliphate during the 717-718 Siege of Constantinople. Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by caltrops, 10th‚Äì12th century, National Historical Museum, Athens, Greece Grenade (8th century) Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the Byzantine Empire, as the Byzantine soldiers learned that Greek fire, a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by flamethrowers at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. Longbow with massed, disciplined archery (13th century) Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval knight class. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). Steel crossbow (late 14th century) European innovation came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.  Miscellaneous  Combined arms tactics (14th century) The battle of Halidon Hill 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed. The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows. Combining dismounted knights and men-at- arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the battle of Flodden 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

It is also known as the Madagascar red owl, Madagascar grass-owl and Soumange's owl. It is a rare resident of Madagascar that was virtually unknown from its discovery in 1876 to its rediscovery by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature in 1993. It is currently listed as vulnerable because of habitat loss, but recent studies have determined it may have a wider range than first believed, though further research in distribution and ecology is required. It has possibly been overlooked because of its close resemblance to the closely related barn owl. The red owl resembles the cosmopolitan barn owl but is smaller (27‚Äì30 cm) and has rich orange plumage with small black spots. It is known to live in humid evergreen forest and dry deciduous forest in the east of the island, being found in primary forest and in disturbed secondary forest (possibly even human altered open areas). It feeds on native small-mammals like tenrecs (Tenrecidae) and tufted-tailed rats (as opposed to the barn owl, which feeds on introduced species). It nests and roosts in tree cavities and along cliffs with dense vegetation. Description The red owl is an orange- red color with small black spots and a dark grey/brown facial disk. Eyes are typically a sooty-black color, the beak is a pale grey, and the cere (a fleshy patch at the base of the upper mandible of the beak) is flesh-colored. Feet are a smoke-grey color. One individual collected was measured: weight of 323 grams, body length of 275 mm, unflattened wing-length of 209 mm, tail length of 100 mm, tarsus-length of 56.6 mm and width of 6.0 mm, and a beak length from the cere of 11.6 mm. Vocalization The call of the red owl is similar to that of the barn owl. They make a 1.5 ‚Äì 2.0 second long screeching hiss that is an even frequency with a slight downward frequency towards the end. This slight decrease in frequency at the end of the call distinguishes the red owl from the barn owl. The red owl will produce a call when leaving the roost site, immediately after leaving the roost site, and in response to other red owls throughout the night. Distribution and habitat The observed range of the red owl has been evolving frequently with an increase in surveys and observation since its rediscovery in 1993. The first known nest found was in August 1995 near Ambanizana, Madagascar. Initial surveys restricted populations in the north and extreme east of the island. Recent sightings have ranged from northern Madagascar, along the eastern half of the island, and more recently in the extreme southeast lowlands of Tsitongambarika. The sightings cover a fairly wide altitudinal range, from sea level to 2,000 m. Because of this expansion in observed range, it has been proposed that the red owl may be more reclusive rather than extremely rare. This has been disputed, but if the overall number of individuals is low, whether due to patchy distribution and/or low population density, it is still appropriate to consider the species vulnerable or endangered. A conservative estimate of the current population is 3,500 ‚Äì 15,000 individuals with a decreasing trend. A population towards the lower side of population estimate may be true based on the relatively few number of sightings throughout history despite more extensive survey work. With wider distribution, the difficulty detecting the species may stem from these factors: * it is reclusive, * it is mistaken for the barn owl in surveys, * the species exists patchily and/or at low population densities. The red owl inhabits dry deciduous forests to humid evergreen forests. They prefer to roost on rock ledges in ravines and cave entrances that are near degraded primary and secondary vegetation. Roost sites are typically at least 3.7 m from the ground. The species appear to prefer areas along the forest edge and slightly to heavily disturbed habitat, including rice paddies and tavies (areas where the forest has been cleared and burned to make way for cultivation). Their home ranges, roost sites, and hunting range typically encompass this type of habitat. An individual red owl has never been recorded to be in a closed canopy forest or a mature forest stand. Diet The diet of the red owl has been determined from pellets and observation. They feed mostly on small mammals of the families Tenrecidae and Muridae that are native to the island. Prey species include insects, frogs, geckoes, tenrecs, afrosoricidians (Microgale spp., Oryzorictes hova), rodents (Eliurus spp., Rattus rattus), and the eastern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). All species are native to Madagascar except the black rat (Rattus rattus). In one sampling of pellets, Tsingy tufted-tailed rats were 50% of the total prey mass of red owls in Ankarana. There is little to no evidence that red owls consume frogs in the wild, as they appear to prefer small mammals, but they will frequently eat frogs in captivity. Most of the prey species inhabit forests or can be found on the forest edge and in disturbed habitats. There is almost no overlap in preferred diet between the red owl and the barn owl, despite physical similarities. Red owls eat mostly native species, while barn owls eat a greater number of introduced species. Threats The greatest threat to the red owl has been the increasing rate of deforestation and fragmentation of its forest habitat. Madagascar's forests are among the most biologically rich and unique in the world and close to 90% of the islands species live within or on the edge of these forests and woodlands. In the 1950s, 160,000 km2 of forest cover (as determined from analysis of aerial photographs) was present, 26% of which was dry forest, the prime habitat for red owls. By the 2000s, analysis of aerial photos showed a decrease in forest cover to 89,800 ‚Äì 101,100 km2 with 90% accuracy. This represents a 41% reduction in dry forest area, with most clearing at the small scale along forest edges. Dry forests were the most fragmented forest type and increased the most in fragmentation from the 1950s ‚Äì 1990s. This forest degradation presents a threat to red owls as well as the prey species, such as the Tsingy tufted-tailed rats, on which the owl depends. References *Cardiff, S.G. and Goodman, S.M. 2008.

Biography Vilhelm Lauritzen was bornin Slagelse, Denmark. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, graduating in 1921. The following year he founded his own firm, Vilhelm Lauritzen Arkitekter, in 1928 and remained active in the firm until 1969. He received the Academy's Gold Medal in 1926 and up through the 1920s he created a number of monumental designs in a classicist style which were never realized.Anne-Louise Sommer: Towards the end of the decade he travelled in Central Europe and became acquainted with the latest trends in Functionalist architecture with its technical and structural innovations. This inspired him to a grounded and restrained Modernism and it was with such buildings that he had his breakthrough. His first large commission to be built was the Daells Varehus department store in Copenhagen built in stages from 1928 to 1935 as one of the first examples of Modern architecture in Denmark. He went on to win the competition for the design the first Copenhagen Airport which was constructed from 1937 to 1939. Another major project included the national Danish Broadcasting Corporation DR Radio Building (Radiohuset) while its Television Building was designed by his firm with Mogens Boertmann (1918-2017) as its principal architect. Lauritzen also designed furniture, often in connection with his buildings. His lamps, especially his table lamps from the 1930s, manufactured by Louis Poulsen, continue to arouse interest at auctions.Per H.

He has translated books from Pali, Sanskrit, Arabic, Japanese, Classical Chinese, and Old Irish into English. Cleary lives in Oakland, California, a city on the West Coast of the United States. Life and work Cleary became interested in Buddhism when he was a teenager; his researches into Buddhist thought began with a desire to learn during this time of his life. When he began translating, he chose either untranslated works or‚Äîas in the case of Sun Tzu's The Art of War‚Äîbooks whose extant translations were \\"too limited\\". Cleary earned a Ph.D in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University, and a JD from the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. Since completing his doctoral studies, Cleary has had little involvement with the academic world. \\"There is too much oppression in a university setting\\", he says. \\"I want to stay independent and reach those who want to learn directly through my books.\\" Cleary's brother Jonathon also completed his doctoral work in EALC at Harvard. The two brothers worked together to translate the koan collection The Blue Cliff Record; Shambhala published the translation in 1977. Thomas Cleary's most widely disseminated translation has been of Sun Tzu's The Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa). He also translated the monumental Avatamsaka Sutra (also called Huayan Jing, or the Flower Ornament Scripture). Another major translation was of the commentaries of the 18th century Taoist sage Liu Yiming, who explains the metaphoric coding of the main Taoist texts dealing with the transformation of consciousness, and the fusion of the human mind with the mind of Tao. In 2000, Cleary's various translations of Taoist texts were collected into four volumes by Shambhala Publications as The Taoist Classics. Following the success of these publications, a five-volume collection of Buddhist translations was collected as Classics of Buddhism and Zen. Another translation from the Muslim wisdom tradition is Living and Dying with Grace. In 1993 Cleary published a translation of Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings.

Shah Abdol Azim was a fifth generation descendant of Hasan ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´ and a companion of Muhammad al-Taqƒ´. He was entombed here after his death in the 9th century. Adjacent to the shrine, within the complex, include the mausolea of Imamzadeh Tahir (son of the fourth Shia Imam Sajjad) and Imamzadeh Hamzeh (brother of the eighth Twelver ImƒÅm - ImƒÅm Reza). Background Abdol Azim migrated to Rayy out of persecution and subsequently died there. A piece of paper was found in his pocket outlining his ancestry as being: ‚ÄòAbdul ‚ÄòAdhƒ´m son of ‚ÄòAbdillƒÅh son of ‚ÄòAlƒ´ son of Husayn son of Zayd son of Hasan ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´. Shah Abdol Azim was sent to Rayy ( Modern day Tehran) by Imam Reza. His journey was full of hardships but he successfully reached there and delivered the message of Imam. He was one of the pious persons of his time. During his journey many spies of Abbasid Caliph Al-Matawakkil tried to capture him but failed.

The whole construction consists of a portal with a lofty Iwan decorated with mirrors, several courtyards, a golden cupola, two tile minarets, a portico, a sepulcher, and a mosque. The most historical and portable relic of this holy place, is its costly box which is made of betel- nut wood. On four sides of this precious box, a relief inscription in Nastaliq and Thuluth characters, is carved. The inscription ends with the date 1330 CE, and the name of the maker of the box, i.e., Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Isfahani. An inlaid door near the mausoleum of Nasser al-Din Shah, (This place used to be called Masjid-i-Holaku, prior to its being turned into a tomb) which bears the date 1450 CE, i.e., the period of Shah-rokh Bahadur Timurid\`s reign, constitutes another historical relic of this structure. Two antique iron doors which are engraved with Kufic inscriptions are to be found in the treasure- house of the (Astaneh), which seem to be the oldest remains of this structure and to belong to the Seljukid period. But, at present, these two doors and the concluding part of their inscriptions bear the date 1538. Further, there is an inlaid door which had formerly been installed in the northern part of the ivan of Imamzadeh Hamzeh. Inside Shrine This door has an inscription in Tulth calligraphy, dated 1512. The cupola of this structure has been built upon the order of Majd al-Mulk radestani Qomi, and later on has been plated with gold. The ivan, portico and portal of the building date from the reign of Shah Tahmasp I (Safavid king). The gold-threaded silk belonging to the Safavid period. The silver-plated sepulcher has been made and installed by the order of Fath Ali Shah Qajar. The mirror-work, paintings and gildings of the structure belong to the 19th century. Reparations are still being carried out in this complex of holy structures. Adjoining this holy tomb, there are some other tombs belonging to the Qajar monarchs, and the Ulamahs (religious scholars) and other personalities.

Melville Peninsula is a large peninsula in the Canadian Arctic north of Hudson Bay. To the east is Foxe Basin and to the west the Gulf of Boothia. To the north the Fury and Hecla Strait separates it from Baffin Island. To the south Repulse Bay and Frozen Strait separate it from Southampton Island at the north end of Hudson Bay. On the southwest it is connected to the mainland by the \\"Rae Isthmus\\" named after arctic explorer Dr John Rae. Between 1821 and 1823 its east side was mapped by William Edward Parry. Since 1999, it has been part of Nunavut. Before that, it was part of the District of Franklin. Most of the peninsula lies in Nunavut's Qikiqtaaluk Region, while its southwesternmost section, around Repulse Bay, lies in the Kivalliq Region. Communities on the peninsula include the hamlets of Repulse Bay and Hall Beach. The hamlet of Igloolik is located on an island lying just off the northeastern coast of the peninsula.

Current undergraduate members host regular \\"Roundtable Dinners\\" featuring talks by faculty and alumni. The first clubhouse was Ivy Hall, a brownstone building on Mercer Street in Princeton that still stands. It had been constructed by Richard Stockton Field in 1847 as the home for the Princeton Law School, a short-lived venture that lasted from 1847 to 1852. From the time of its founding until its incorporation in 1883, the club was generally known as the \\"Ivy Hall Eating Club.\\" In 1883 the club purchased an empty lot on Prospect Avenue, which was a country dirt road at the time. Ivy erected a shingle-style clubhouse in 1884 on what is today the site of Colonial Club. The clubhouse was remodeled and extended in 1887-88. Following Ivy's move to new quarters across Prospect Avenue some ten years later, its second clubhouse was used by Colonial before being sold and moved to Plainsboro Township, New Jersey. Ivy's third and current clubhouse was designed in 1897 by the Philadelphia firm of Cope & Stewardson. In 2009, the club completed its most significant renovation to date. The expansion added a second wing to the facility, changing the club's original L-shaped layout to a U. Designed by Demetri Porphyrios, the new wing includes a two-story Great Hall and a crypt to provide additional study space.

He defined it as a three-part study: ‚Äú[T]hese three divisions can be described as: One, Liking the world; Two, The opposites; Three, The meaning of contempt.‚ÄùEli Siegel, \\"Aesthetic Realism: a Tripartite Study,\\" The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #247 (21 December 1977) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro247.html. Aesthetic Realism differs from other approaches to mind in identifying a person's attitude to the whole world as the most crucial thing in his or her life, affecting how one sees everything, including love, work, and other people. For example, it says racism begins with the desire to have contempt for what is different from oneself.Rich Mkhondo, Sunday Tribune, Durban, South Africa, 01-04-2012 URL:http://www.aesthticrealism.net/Mkhondo-Red-Card.pdfThe Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #2034 (24 June 2020) URL: https://aestheticrealism.net/tro/like-of-the-world-versus-racism/. The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, an educational institution based in SoHo, New York City. In the 1980s the Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject.‚Äú...Aesthetic Realism is, and always has been, for full, completely equal civil rights for everyone. And that includes the right to marry a person of whatever gender one chooses. As is well known, there is intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is definitely not central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 (nearly 30 years ago) the Foundation discontinued its presentation of the fact that through study of Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to do so stopped being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind. https://aestheticrealism.org/a-note-on-aesthetic-realism- and-homosexuality/ Philosophy Eli Siegel described the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism as a study in three parts: ‚ÄúOne, Man's greatest, deepest desire is to like the world honestly. Two, The one way to like the world honestly, not as a conquest of one's own, is to see the world as the aesthetic oneness of opposites. Three, The greatest danger or temptation of man is to get a false importance or glory from the lessening of things not himself; which lessening is Contempt. Even more briefly, these three divisions can be described as: One, Liking the world; Two, The opposites; Three, The meaning of contempt.‚Äù Liking the World A central principle of Aesthetic Realism is that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world. It states that the purpose of art education‚Äîand all education‚Äîis to like the world.Martha Shepp: \\"Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education.\\" (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples & H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.) URL: http://www.marthashepp.com/cv_syll_phil/CritPresent4Website.pdf. Honest like of the world does not depend on how fortunate one is, but on seeing that reality is made well because it has an aesthetic structure, which art shows. Siegel asked, ‚ÄúIs this true: No matter how much of a case one has against the world‚Äîits unkindness, its disorder, its ugliness, its meaninglessness‚Äîone has to do all one can to like it, or one will weaken oneself? The Opposites Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality has an aesthetic structure of opposites. Siegel stated that all the sciences and arts provide evidence of reality's aesthetic structure and can be used to understand and like the world.\\"According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world.\\" For example, motion and rest, freedom and order can be seen as one in an electron, the ocean, the solar system. These opposing forces of reality are within every person, and we are always trying to put them together.James H. Bready, \\"Eli Siegel's system lives\\" in the Baltimore Evening Sun, 28 July 1982: \\"In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled...\\" In Siegel's critical theory, \\"The resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art.\\" A good novel or musical composition, for example, composes opposites that are often in conflict in a person's mind or daily life: intensity and calm, freedom and order, unity and diversity. A successful poem or photograph or work of art in any medium, is therefore, a guide to a good life, because it shows the aesthetic structure of reality and ourselves. ‚ÄúAll beauty,‚Äù he stated, ‚Äúis a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves.‚Äù Deborah A. Straub in Contemporary Authors: \\"This philosophy sprang from Siegel‚Äôs belief that ‚Äòwhat makes a good poem is like what can make a good life‚Ä¶, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.‚Äô\\" \\"The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, 'In reality opposites are one; art shows this.\\" The Meaning of Contempt Siegel recognized that the desire to like the world is in a constant fight with another competing desire: the desire for contempt, or the hope to lessen what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it. \\"There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls 'the world.' These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. 'Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,' he says. Contempt can lead to insanity according to Siegel.\\" He writes in The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, number 247: An Ethical Obligation and the Means of Liking Oneself A key study in Aesthetic Realism is how an attitude to the world as a whole governs how a person sees every aspect of life, including a friend, a spouse, a book, food, people of another skin tone. Accordingly, the philosophy argues that individuals have an ethical obligation to ‚Äúsee the world as well as we can‚Äù and where we don‚Äôt hope to see things and people fairly ‚Äúcontempt ...is winning.‚Äù Deborah Straub: \\"Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies.\\" Contemporary Authors, URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf Accordingly, the philosophy argues that individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important. Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.\\"Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves.\\" The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of depression and broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for \\"human beings placed differently from ourselves\\" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality. Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant basis of humanity's economic activities. The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that \\"the world‚Äôs failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one‚Äôs own life.\\" Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, \\"civilization has yet to begin.\\"Eli Siegel, \\"Civilization Begins\\" in The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #228 (10 August 1977).

The first, Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, was written from 1941‚Äì3. Individual chapters, including \\"Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics\\" and \\"The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict\\", were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981. It presents the philosophy in terms of how it applies to everyday life and understanding mind. Chapters include \\"The Aesthetic Meaning of Psychiatry\\", \\"Love and Reality\\", \\"The Child\\", and \\"The Organization of Self\\" (NY: Definition Press).D.E., Booklist, (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): \\"A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect.\\" A second text, Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World, completed in 1945, defines 134 terms, including Existence, Happiness, Power, Success, Reality, and Relation. Definitions of one sentence are given for every term, followed by a lengthier explanation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known. A third philosophic text, The Aesthetic Nature of the World, is largely unpublished, although selections appear in The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.\\"The Fight about Knowledge‚Äî in Schools & Everywhere,\\" The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #1962 (20 September 2017) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/the-fight-about-knowledge-in- schools-and-everywhere.html. Poetry Aesthetic Realism arose from Eli Siegel's teaching of poetry. He stated that ideas central to the philosophy were present in his poem \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\", which won The Nation's annual poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality is relation, \\"that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things\\", is in this poem.Vincent Starrett in the Chicago Sunday Tribune (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): \\"It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'Corbett & Boldt: Modern American Poetry, p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): \\"Siegel‚Äôs poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‚Äòthe very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do- with other things.‚Äô\\" It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana, and travels through time and space, showing that the diversity of reality is surprisingly connected, and things, people and places usually regarded as separate \\"have a great deal to do with each other.\\" Aesthetic Realism Foundation Ellen Reiss, Chairman of EducationThe not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in SoHo, New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is now taught, in public seminars, dramatic and musical presentations, semester classes, and individual consultations. There is an interactive workshop for teachers, ‚ÄúThe Aesthetic Realism Teaching Method‚Äù, and classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and \\"Understanding Marriage.\\"Katinka Matson, p.34, The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development (William Morrow & Co., Inc., 1977): \\"The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life. In seminars, a consultation trio discusses aesthetic solutions to these problems, in terms of music, literature, poetry, painting, history, etc.\\"Deborah A. Straub, Contemporary Authors: \\"Informing and educating the public has therefore become the primary task of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation‚Ä¶whose staff members conduct seminars, workshops, and consultation sessions.\\" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf Ellen Reiss is the Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, appointed by Eli Siegel in 1977.

In one of his earliest essays, \\"The Equality of Man\\" (1923), Siegel opposed writers who were promoting eugenics. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had \\"an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal.\\"The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922‚Äì1923 (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: \\"Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal.\\" According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, \\"the addition to self through the lessening of something else.\\" In her commentary to The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, Ellen Reiss wrote about the massive American protests that followed the killing of George Floyd by a police officer who pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes: \\"Millions of Americans see that this video-captured killing of Mr. Floyd represents something ongoing: the daily injustice toward black people, which takes many forms. And millions of Americans feel, This ugliness must stop!\\"The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #2034 (24 June 2020) URL: https://aestheticrealism.net/tro/like-of-the- world-versus-racism/.

The book includes essays about Aesthetic Realism, which is described as \\"the education that can end racism.\\" A production of The People of Clarendon County‚Äîa Play by Ossie Davis, & the Answer to Racism, presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by Rep.

The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'\\" History Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at Steinway Hall in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), \\"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.\\"Donald Kirkley, \\"Poet Outlines a Philosophy,\\" Baltimore Sun, 2 August 1946: \\"More than 160 persons‚Ä¶attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight‚Äôs theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‚Äòa philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.‚Äô\\" From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in Greenwich Village, where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.\\"From Here to Obscurity\\" by Michael Kernan, The Washington Post, 16 August 1978: \\"[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village‚Ä¶[Siegel] gave his first lessons‚Ä¶.[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities.\\" Eli Siegel gave over 30,000 such lectures and lessons over the four decades he taught Aesthetic Realism. One series, ‚ÄúAesthetic Realism As Beauty‚Äù, considered how particular opposites are brought together in the drama, music, sculpture, dance, and painting, and demonstrated how each of these arts unites opposites that are often in conflict in life situations. He lectured on ‚ÄúAesthetic Realism and Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúAesthetic Realism and Scientific Method‚Äù, ‚ÄúAesthetic Realism and H.G. Wells‚Äô The Outline of History‚Äù and ‚ÄúAesthetic Realism Looks at Things: Understanding Children‚Äù. He gave a series of lectures on Henry James that was later published as the book James and the Children: A Consideration of Henry James‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Turn of the Screw‚Äù. He gave a series of lectures on Imagination, Religion, and the Arts and Sciences. Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarlyDonald Kirkley, Baltimore Sun, 24 September 1944: \\"These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer‚Äôs opinion, scholarly and valuable.\\" and sought to demonstrate that art is related to the problems of everyday life.The Villager, 26 July 1956: \\"This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel.\\"Siegel‚Äôs assertion that the world is seen truly in art contradicted the Freudian view, popular at the time, of art as sublimation. This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.Katinka Matson, Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development (William Morrow & Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate and inanimate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder.\\" The Terrain Gallery and the arts Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were Chaim Koppelman (1920‚Äì2009),ChaimKoppelman.net . a painter, sculptor, printmaker,Trudie A.

There probably hasn‚Äôt been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‚ÄòAesthetic Realism‚Äô as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition‚Ä¶.Aesthetic Realism is: ‚ÄòThe art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.‚Äô\\" Chaim Koppelman's interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel's Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.Smithsonian Archives of American Art: \\"Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968.\\" Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including Ralph Hattersley, editor of the photography journal Infinity,Ralph Hattersley, \\"Form and Content in Color,\\" Popular Photography July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84‚Äì87): \\"The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‚ÄòIn reality opposites are one; art shows this.‚Äô Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is.\\" and Nat Herz, author of articles in Modern Photography and of the Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.Nat Herz, Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography, Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960). Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites \\"relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics\\".Library Journal, 1 September 1969: \\"Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‚Äòall beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.‚Äô Since the 1940s, this poet- philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‚Äòthat the structure of reality is aesthetic.‚Äô He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics.\\" Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy. A theatrical production of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as \\"essentially good\\", in keeping with Siegel's interpretation of the play,Eli Siegel, \\"Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler,\\" New York Times, Sunday, 15 March 1970: \\"Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful? I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life.\\" was highly praised in Time magazine,Ted Kalem, Time, 19 December 1969, p. 58: \\"Now, in an off- off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman.\\" but severely criticized in The New York Times,Walter Kerr, \\"Hedda Is Not Candida,\\" New York Times, 25 January 1970: \\"It is wholly boring and only boring‚Ä¶.It doesn‚Äôt really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good. All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe.\\"Clive Barnes, \\"Hedda Gabler: the Good Person,\\" New York Times, 18 January 1970: \\"To see Ibsen‚Äôs wonderful and dangerous Hedda‚Ä¶as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright‚Äôs clear demands.\\" which also published Siegel's response to the critics.Eli Siegel, \\"Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler,\\" New York Times, Sunday, 15 March 1970: \\"The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence‚Ä¶.As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor‚Äôs Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn.\\" Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919‚Äì1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.John Lewis: \\"Gays Who Have Gone Straight,\\" NY Daily News, March 15, 1981. \\"The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently.\\" Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to Obie award-winning actress Anne Fielding.Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; Free Time show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in The H Persuasion, Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). \\"Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women‚Ä¶so that one can be permanently heterosexual.\\" Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: \\"One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards.\\" Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding (1980) In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.\\"The Homosexual Story\\" by Eli Siegel, The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, Issue #316, April 25, 1979. \\"Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently.\\"Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, Free Time show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in The H Persuasion, Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), \\"Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women‚Ä¶so that one can be permanently heterosexual.\\"Elmhurst Press (Elmhurst, Illinois), \\"Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality,\\" August 17, 1983, \\"Five formerly homosexual men‚Ä¶appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel‚Ä¶It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes.\\" A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.\\"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality\\" by Kay Longcope, The Boston Globe, April 18, 1982. \\"The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‚ÄòEvery person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.\\" Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.Deborah A. Staub in Contemporary Authors. \\"The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‚Äòevery person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.‚Äô Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‚ÄòH Persuasion‚Äô--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism.\\" In the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, Free Time, show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in The H Persuasion, Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): \\"It‚Äôs a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible‚Ä¶.A person becomes educated‚Ä¶to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that‚Ä¶such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‚ÄòThis is not what I want.‚Äô Now, as I said‚Ä¶if people‚Ä¶really can say, ‚ÄòI like myself this way, really,‚Äô ‚Äìit‚Äôs not for me to say one way or the other.\\" Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.The H Persuasion, Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. \\"Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism.\\" In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City's WNET Channel 13 Free Time showFree Time show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971 and the David Susskind Show,The David Susskind Show WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York. which had a national syndication. The book The H Persuasion,The H Persuasion, Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971) published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how. In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality. In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the David Susskind Show.The David Susskind Show WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York. The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.Ellen Reiss, editor, The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality (New York: Definition Press, 1986) With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling The H Persuasion \\"less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,\\"The New York Times, Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971 the New York Times never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.Robin Green: \\"FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be\\" The Globe and Mail, April 28, 1978, p.8 \\"Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists‚Ä¶who are mad at the New York Times because the Times, they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism.\\" Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people.

The technology is primarily used in large, multi-cylinder engines. Many automobile manufacturers have adopted this technology as of 2005, although the concept has existed for some time prior to this. Theory of operation Cylinder deactivation is used to reduce the fuel consumption and emissions of an internal combustion engine during light-load operation. In typical light-load driving the driver uses only around 30 percent of an engine‚Äôs maximum power. In these conditions, the throttle valve is nearly closed, and the engine needs to work to draw air. This causes an inefficiency known as pumping loss. Some large capacity engines need to be throttled so much at light load that the cylinder pressure at top dead centre is approximately half that of a small 4-cylinder engine. Low cylinder pressure results in lower fuel efficiency. The use of cylinder deactivation at light load means there are fewer cylinders drawing air from the intake manifold, which works to increase its fluid (air) pressure. Operation without variable displacement is wasteful because fuel is continuously pumped into each cylinder and combusted even though maximum performance is not required. By shutting down half of an engine's cylinders, the amount of fuel being consumed is much less. Between reducing the pumping losses, which increases pressure in each operating cylinder, and decreasing the amount of fuel being pumped into the cylinders, fuel consumption can be reduced by 8 to 25 percent in highway conditions. Cylinder deactivation is achieved by keeping the intake and exhaust valves closed for a particular cylinder. By keeping the intake and exhaust valves closed, it creates an \\"air spring\\" in the combustion chamber ‚Äì the trapped exhaust gases (kept from the previous charge burn) are compressed during the piston‚Äôs upstroke and push down on the piston during its downstroke. The compression and decompression of the trapped exhaust gases have an equalising effect ‚Äì overall, there is virtually no extra load on the engine. In the latest breed of cylinder deactivation systems, the engine management system is also used to cut fuel delivery to the disabled cylinders. The transition between normal engine operation and cylinder deactivation is also smoothed, using changes in ignition timing, cam timing and throttle position (thanks to electronic throttle control). In most instances, cylinder deactivation is applied to relatively large displacement engines that are particularly inefficient at light load. In the case of a V12, up to 6 cylinders can be disabled. Two issues to overcome with all variable- displacement engines are unbalanced cooling and vibration. History The oldest engine technological predecessor for the variable-displacement engine is the hit and miss engine, developed in the late 19th century. These single- cylinder stationary engines had a centrifugal governor that cut the cylinder out of operation so long as the engine was operating above a set speed, typically by holding the exhaust valve open. Cadillac L62 V8-6-4 Cadillac V8-6-4 emblem First experiments with multiple-cylinder engines during WWII, were re-attempted in 1981 on Cadillac's ill-fated L62 \\"V8-6-4\\" engine. The technology was made a standard feature on all Cadillac models except Seville, which had the 350 diesel V-8 engine as a base engine. Cadillac, in conjunction with Eaton Corporation, developed the innovative V-8-6-4 system which used the industry's first engine control unit to switch the engine from 8- to 6- to 4-cylinder operation depending on the amount of power needed. The original multi-displacement system turned off opposite pairs of cylinders, allowing the engine to have three different configurations and displacements. The cars had an elaborate diagnostics procedure, including showing engine trouble codes on the air conditioning display. However, the system was troublesome, misunderstood by customers, and a rash of unpredictable failures led to the technology being quickly retired. Alfa Romeo Alfetta CEM In 1981 Alfa Romeo developed in collaboration with the University of Genoa a semi-experimental variable displacement engine version of the Alfa Romeo Alfetta, called Alfetta CEM (Controllo Elettronico del Motore, or Electronic Engine Management), and showed it at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The 2.0-litre modular engine featured fuel injection and ignition systems governed by an engine control unit, which could shut off two of four cylinders as needed in order to reduce fuel consumption. An initial batch of 10 examples were assigned to taxi drivers in Milan, to verify operation and performance in real-world situations. According to Alfa Romeo during these tests cylinder deactivation was found to reduce fuel consumption by 12% in comparison to a CEM fuel-injected engine without variable displacement, and almost by 25% in comparison to the regular production carburetted 2.0-litre. After the first trial, in 1983 a small series of 1000 examples was put on sale, offered to selected clients; 991 examples were produced. Despite this second experimental phase, the project had no further developments.  Mitsubishi MD In 1982 Mitsubishi developed its own variable displacement in the form of MD (Modulated Displacement) which proved that the technology, first used in Mitsubishi's 1.4 L 4G12 straight-four engine, can function successfully. Because Cadillac's system proved to be a failure and a four-cylinder engine was used, Mitsubishi hailed their own as a world first. The technology was later used in Mitsubishi's V6 engines.\\"Mountain of MIVECs\\" , Michael Knowling, AutoSpeed, Issue 346, September 3, 2005 The system worked by disabling the valves on cylinders number 1 and 4 at speeds below , at idling, and while decelerating. Fuel consumption figures were generally about 20 percent improved over the regular 4G12 engine. Period sources, however, complained about the engine running very roughly while in two-cylinder mode, despite special engine mounts with hydraulic damping. Other efforts taken to minimize vibrations and harshness included a section of flexible exhaust pipe, not operating the system until the coolant temperature reached 70C, and a 70 percent heavier flywheel.Fukui et al, p.367 Mitsubishi's effort remained short-lived, mainly because of a lack of response from car buyers. In 1993, a year after Mitsubishi developed its own variable valve timing technology, the MIVEC-MD variant was introduced. The revived MD technology was now in its second generation with improved electronic engine controls enabling the switch from 4 to 2 cylinders to be made almost imperceptibly. In MD mode, the MIVEC engine utilizes only two of its four cylinders, which reduces significantly the energy wasted due to pumping losses. In addition, power loss due to engine friction is also reduced. Depending on conditions, the MIVEC-MD system can reduce fuel consumption by 10‚Äì20 percent; although some of this gain is from the variable valve timing system, not from the variable-displacement feature. Modulated Displacement was dropped around 1996. Aftermarket systems A number of companies have developed aftermarket cylinder deactivation systems, with varying degrees of success. The 1979 EPA evaluation of the Automotive Cylinder Deactivation System (ACDS), which allowed eight-cylinder engines to be run on four cylinders, found that carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions were increased beyond the legal limits of the emission standards then in force. While fuel economy was increased, acceleration was seriously compromised, and the loss of engine vacuum led to a dangerous loss of braking assist when the system was in four-cylinder mode. In addition to these issues, while the company proposed a hydraulically controlled system that could be switched from within the car, the version they implemented had to be manually changed in the engine compartment using hand tools. Present There are currently two main types of cylinder deactivation mechanizations used today, depending on the type of the engine's valvetrain. The first is for pushrod designs which uses solenoids to alter oil pressure delivered to lock pins in the lifters. With lock pin out of place, the lifters are collapsed and unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the valve rocker arms, resulting in valves that remain closed when the cam pushes on the part in lost motion. The second type is for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together rocker arms that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two rocker arms. While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and doesn't move the valve.\\"Cylinder Deactivation\\", About.com, Christine & Scott Gable With computer control, fast cylinder deactivation and reactivation occur almost instantly. Several automotive manufacturers have engines with cylinder deactivation in current production. Daimler AG's Active Cylinder Control (ACC) variable displacement technology debuted in 2001 on the 5.8 L V12 in the CL600 and S600. Mercedes-Benz developed their Multi- Displacement System V12 in the late 1990s, which shuts off every other cylinder in the firing order. It was widely deployed on pushrod V8 engines starting with the 2004 DaimlerChrysler Hemi. Starting in 2003, Honda introduced Variable Cylinder Management on the J family engines. Honda's system works by deactivating banks of cylinders, switching from 6 to 4 to 3 cylinders. In 2005, GM introduced their Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation system (in the Generation IV small-block) which, similar to Chrysler's MDS, switched off half of the cylinders. In 2018 GM introduced an improved system called Dynamic Fuel Management that shuts off any number of cylinders, in a variety of combinations, depending on immediate needs. The system is based on Dynamic Skip Fire, a technology developed by California company Tula Technology and the 6.2L engine incorporating it was named one of Ward's 10 Best Engines for 2019. In 2012 Volkswagen introduced Active Cylinder Technology (ACT), the first manufacturer to do so in four-cylinder engines. In November 2016 Ford announced its compact three-cylinder Ecoboost engine with deactivation on one of the cylinders. This is the smallest engine so far to use deactivation, and will allow the benefits to be applied in small cars. In November 2017, Mazda announced standard cylinder deactivation in all 2018 CX-5 models, and availability on Mazda6 models. As of the 2019 model year, about 13% of light-duty vehicles sold in the United States used cylinder deactivation, predominantly used by Mazda (54%), GM (47%), Honda (21%), and FCA (19%).https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends- report Related technologies Variable compression ratio. The best known such system was the experimental Saab Variable Compression engine, which used a hinged block to move the pistons closer to or further from the head, thus changing the size of the combustion chambers. Other experimental systems include the Hefley engine, which uses a sliding crank race on an eccentric shaft, and the Scalzo Piston Deactivation Engine, which uses a four-bar linkage, and has the distinction of being able to stop individual pistons entirely. There are currently no production vehicles that use any of these designs. Additionally, Cadillac's Northstar engine series featured a \\"limp home\\" fail-safe mode.

They are caused by the absorption of light by the interstellar medium. Circa 500 bands have now been seen, in ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. The origin of DIBs was unknown and disputed for many years, and the DIBs were long believed to be due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other large carbon-bearing molecules. Their rapid and efficient deactivation when photoexcited accounts for their remarkable photostability and therefore possible abundance in the interstellar medium. However, no agreement of the bands could be found with laboratory measurements or with theoretical calculations until July 2015, when the group of John Maier (University of Basel) announced the unequivocal assignment of two lines for Buckminsterfullerene (C60+), confirming a prediction made in 1987. Discovery and history Much astronomical work relies on the study of spectra - the light from astronomical objects dispersed using a prism or, more usually, a diffraction grating. A typical stellar spectrum will consist of a continuum, containing absorption lines, each of which is attributed to a particular atomic energy level transition in the atmosphere of the star. The appearances of all astronomical objects are affected by extinction, the absorption and scattering of photons by the interstellar medium. Relevant to DIBs is interstellar absorption, which predominantly affects the whole spectrum in a continuous way, rather than causing absorption lines. In 1922, though, astronomer Mary Lea Heger first observed a number of line-like absorption features which seemed to be interstellar in origin. Their interstellar nature was shown by the fact that the strength of the observed absorption was roughly proportional to the extinction, and that in objects with widely differing radial velocities the absorption bands were not affected by Doppler shifting, implying that the absorption was not occurring in or around the object concerned. The name Diffuse Interstellar Band, or DIB for short, was coined to reflect the fact that the absorption features are much broader than the normal absorption lines seen in stellar spectra. The first DIBs observed were those at wavelengths 578.0 and 579.7 nanometers (visible light corresponds to a wavelength range of 400 - 700 nanometers). Other strong DIBs are seen at 628.4, 661.4 and 443.0 nm. The 443.0 nm DIB is particularly broad at about 1.2 nm across - typical intrinsic stellar absorption features are 0.1 nm or less across. Later spectroscopic studies at higher spectral resolution and sensitivity revealed more and more DIBs; a catalogue of them in 1975 contained 25 known DIBs, and a decade later the number known had more than doubled. The first detection-limited survey was published by Peter Jenniskens and Xavier Desert in 1994 (see Figure above), which led to the first conference on The Diffuse Interstellar Bands at the University of Colorado in Boulder on May 16‚Äì19, 1994. Today circa 500 have been detected. In recent years, very high resolution spectrographs on the world's most powerful telescopes have been used to observe and analyse DIBs. Spectral resolutions of 0.005 nm are now routine using instruments at observatories such as the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal, Chile, and the Anglo- Australian Observatory in Australia, and at these high resolutions, many DIBs are found to contain considerable sub-structure. The nature of the carrier The great problem with DIBs, apparent from the earliest observations, was that their central wavelengths did not correspond with any known spectral lines of any ion or molecule, and so the material which was responsible for the absorption could not be identified. A large number of theories were advanced as the number of known DIBs grew, and determining the nature of the absorbing material (the 'carrier') became a crucial problem in astrophysics. One important observational result is that the strengths of most DIBs are not strongly correlated with each other. This means that there must be many carriers, rather than one carrier responsible for all DIBs. Also significant is that the strength of DIBs is broadly correlated with the interstellar extinction. Extinction is caused by interstellar dust; however, DIBs, are not likely to be caused by dust grains. The existence of sub-structure in DIBs supports the idea that they are caused by molecules. Substructure results from band heads in the rotational band contour and from isotope substitution. In a molecule containing, say, three carbon atoms, some of the carbon will be in the form of the carbon-13 isotope, so that while most molecules will contain three carbon-12 atoms, some will contain two 12C atoms and one 13C atom, much less will contain one 12C and two 13C, and a very small fraction will contain three 13C molecules. Each of these forms of the molecule will create an absorption line at a slightly different rest wavelength. The most likely candidate molecules for producing DIBs are thought to be large carbon-bearing molecules, which are common in the interstellar medium. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, long carbon-chain molecules such as polyynes, and fullerenes are all potentially important. Fullerene C60+ identified as carrier of diffuse interstellar bands The first prediction that C60+ could be a carrier of DIBs was put forward by Harry Kroto, co-discoverer of C60. In 1987, Kroto proposed that \\"The present observations indicate that C60 might survive in the general medium (probably as the ion C60+) protected by its unique ability to survive processes so drastic that most, if not all, other known molecules are destroyed.\\" However, that time it was hard to prove due to inability to record a reliable spectrum of C60+. Only in 2015, C60+ spectrum was obtained by the group of John Maier at the University of Basel. They developed a state of the art spectroscopic technique that allowed observation of C60+ spectrum at the low temperature and low pressure comparable with interstellar medium. The precise overlap between diffused bands at 9632 √Ö and 9577 √Ö observed by Foing and Enhrenfreund in 1994 and spectroscopic bands of C60+ in helium matrix recorded in 2015, has confirmed C60+ as a first DIB carrier. Later on, three other C60+ bands at 9428 √Ö, 9365 √Ö, and 9348 √Ö were found among near-infrared DIBs. The presence of the 9365 √Ö, 9428 √Ö and 9577 √Ö C60+ bands was subsequently confirmed using the Hubble Space Telescope, towards a sample of seven Galactic background stars, which helped place the assignment of interstellar C60+ beyond reasonable doubt. The origin of closely spaced C60+ bands was not understood until 2018, when the quantum chemistry studies revealed the Jahn-Teller distortion of C60+ excited state. This distortion leads to the two excited states (Bg and Ag) populated upon light illumination. Two states form two progressions of closely spaced absorption bands. The strong bands at 9632 √Ö and 9577 √Ö were assigned to the cold electronic excitations, while the weak bands at 9428 √Ö, 9365 √Ö, and 9348 √Ö to the hot vibronic excitations.

Since the late 1990s Heatherwick has emerged as one of Britain's most significant designers. Heatherwick works with a team of around 180 architects, designers and makers from a studio and workshop in King's Cross, London. Heatherwick has been involved in the design of many projects, some controversial, including the Olympic Cauldron, the New Routemaster bus, and the UK pavilion at Expo 2010.Icon Magazine, July 2012 Other notable projects include the renovation of the Hong Kong Pacific Place, the now-cancelled Garden Bridge, a proposed plan for a biomass power station in BEI-Teesside, and the Vessel in New York City. Early life Bleigiessen, Wellcome Trust, London Heatherwick was born in London on 17 February 1970. His maternal great-grandfather was the owner of Jaeger, the leading London fashion firm, and his uncle was the journalist Nicholas Tomalin. After primary school in Wood Green, north London, he attended the private Sevenoaks School in Kent. He also attended the Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley, in Hertfordshire, which puts an emphasis on gardening, handiwork, and a bespoke form of performance art called eurythmy. He studied three-dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art (RCA). In his final year at RCA in 1994, Heatherwick met designer Terence Conran who came to give a talk at the school. Conran became a mentor to Heatherwick after seeing his plan for a gazebo made of two for his degree project, 6 m high curved stacks of birch plywood, and made its construction possible by inviting Heatherwick to work at his country home. After graduating from the RCA in 1994, Heatherwick founded Heatherwick Studio. Conran asked Heatherwick to make an interior display for the Conran Shop, and this led to his first public commission after Mary Portas saw the display stand, and commissioned Heatherwick to make a window display for the 1997 London Fashion Week at the Harvey Nichols department store. Key works Rolling Bridge Video of the Rolling Bridge in operation In 2002 Heatherwick Studio designed The Rolling Bridge (also known as \\"the curling bridge\\") as part of a redevelopment of Paddington Basin. The bridge is scheduled to unfold across the canal every Wednesday and Friday at noon and every Saturday at 2pm, but is currently out of action. To give access to upcoming water traffic, the bridge curls into an octagon. The bridge consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and is connected above by two part links that collapse towards the deck under the control of hydraulic pistons. The Rolling Bridge won the 2005 British Structural Steel Award. East Beach Cafe In 2005 Heatherwick Studio completed the East Beach Caf√© at Littlehampton, West Sussex. The large steel structure houses a caf√© by daytime and restaurant in the evening. The concept allowed the steel to rust and the colours to develop over time before being fixed with a transparent oil. The caf√© won a RIBA National Award in 2008. B of the Bang B of the Bang, Manchester Heatherwick's design for B of the Bang, a ¬£1.42 million 56m-high sculpture of 180 giant steel spikes, was unveiled outside the City of Manchester Stadium in 2005. It was the tallest public sculpture ever erected in Britain. The structure was commissioned to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games and was named after a quote from former Olympic sprint champion Linford Christie and meant to symbolise the burst of energy as an athlete shoots out of the blocks. However, one of its 180 steel spikes dislodged within two weeks, and a further 22 spikes had to be removed from the sculpture over the next four years. Angel of the North creator Anthony Gormley urged Manchester City Council not to scrap the sculpture and wrote a letter to the Chief Executive Sir Howard Bernstein, where he described the 150-tonne landmark as \\"remarkable, dynamic and engaging\\". He stated that \\"It is a great tribute to Manchester... and to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve.\\" The council decided to put it into storage, saying that it could be rebuilt at a later stage. They said \\"Thomas Heatherwick's B of the Bang was a magnificent artistic statement and it was regrettable that technical problems undermined that vision.\\" The council sued the Heatherwick studios over the problems, settling out of court for ¬£1.7m. Danny Boyle said it was the inspiration for his asking Heatherwick Studio to design the Olympic Cauldron: ‚ÄúIt goes back to the time I spent sitting under his B of the Bang sculpture. I loved it so much; it‚Äôs a tragedy they took it down.‚Äù Worth Abbey Heatherwick was appointed by Worth Abbey in 2009 to redesign its church interior. A modern version of traditional monastic furniture was installed including pews for 700, choir stalls, monastery seats, desks and confession rooms, all of which were fabricated from solid hardwood. Cracks appeared in the pews within months and Church officials put signs on them saying: ‚ÄúCaution: Pew awaiting repair. Please do not sit here.‚Äù Heatherwick has denied responsibility for the defects and has blamed the contractor. UK Pavilion, Shanghai Expo 2010 UK Pavilion at 2010 Expo, Shanghai Heatherwick Studio designed the UK's Pavilion, \\"Seed Cathedral\\", at the Shanghai Expo 2010. The studio developed the idea for the UK Pavilion by exploring the relationship between nature and cities, and incorporated Kew Gardens' Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, whose mission is to collect the seeds of 25% of the world's plant species by 2020. The structure consisted of over 60,000 25-foot acrylic optic fibres. It housed 60,000 plant seeds at the end of acrylic rods, held in place by geometrically-cut holes with the rods inserted therein. In the duration of the six-month Expo, more than eight million people went inside, making it the UK's most visited tourist attraction. At a state ceremony, it was announced that the UK Pavilion had won the event's top prize, the gold medal for pavilion design. The UK Pavilion won a RIBA International Award, the RIBA Lubetkin Prize and the London Design Medal. After the Expo the UK Pavilion's acrylic rods were donated to schools and the World Expo Museum, while others were auctioned for charity. New Routemaster bus New Routemaster double-decker omnibus In 2010 the Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced that Heatherwick Studio would be designing the New Routemaster. It was the first time in more than 50 years that Transport for London commissioned the development of a bus built specifically for the capital. A long asymmetric front window provided the driver with clear kerbside views, while a wrapped glazing panel reflected passenger circulation ‚Äì bringing more daylight into the bus and offering views out over London. Initially the bus reinstated one of the features of the 1950s AEC Routemaster, an open platform at its rear, which offered a \\"hop-on hop-off\\" service. However, the expense of staffing this feature, to avoid the many accidents that occurred on the original bus, has since led to it being discontinued. The design has three doors and two staircases, making it quicker and easier for passengers to board. In engineering terms, the New Routemaster was claimed to be 15 per cent more fuel efficient than the existing hybrid buses and 40 per cent more efficient than conventional diesel double-deckers. Designs for the new bus were originally unveiled in May 2010 and a prototype, developed and manufactured by Wrightbus, was launched in December 2011, The first bus entered public service in February 2012 and Transport for London ordered a further 600 buses in September 2012. By 2018, the last of the 1000 new Routemasters were delivered. Current Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has pledged no more new Routemaster buses will be purchased for London, the funds instead going towards upgrading the city's existing fleet with the latest sustainable technologies and purchasing new buses. Critics have pointed to the very large cost and frequent issues caused by the design, including excessive temperatures for passengers in the summer. It is claimed the Routemasters are emitting more harmful particles than the buses they replaced. Prospective London Mayoral candidate Christian Wolmar, who first revealed problems with the new Routemasters, said in July 2015: \\"This project was misconceived from the start. I have been told that drivers have been complaining about the failed batteries since August last year and yet nothing has been done. It is no surprise the emissions are higher than those on conventional buses as the New Bus for London is not operating as designed. It is supposed to be powered by an electric motor, but instead is using its inefficient diesel engine that should, in normal conditions, be running at constant speed.\\" 2012 Olympics, \\"cauldron\\" 2012 Olympic cauldron Heatherwick Studio was asked by Danny Boyle to design the Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron for the London 2012 Olympics, which was lit during the Opening ceremony of the London Olympics on 27 July 2012. The cauldron was made of 204 pieces, which were brought into the Olympic Stadium by children representing each team as part of the Parade of nations. These pieces were mounted on stems which, once lit by seven torchbearers, were raised to merge into one huge flame, representing the coming together in peace of each of the 204 countries competing in the Olympic Games and the collaborative human spirit at the heart of the Games. The copper petals, made at Peterborough-based Contour Autocraft were created by craftsmen who had previously made body parts for car makers such as Bentley. After the close of the Games, the petals were sent to each country as a legacy of their sporting achievements in the Games. In total 204 Olympic petals and 164 Paralympic petals were offered to competing nations. On 26 November 2012 the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson delivered a lasting memento of London's Olympic and Paralympic Games to India's medal-winning athletes in Delhi. In June 2013, New York design studio Atopia claimed that the design of the Olympics cauldron was identical to something they had presented to the London Olympic committee in 2007. They had not been able to raise the issue until 2013 due to a restrictive non-disclosure agreement that prevented all companies from promoting any work related to the Olympics. However, Heatherwick denied that he had been briefed by the commissioner on Atopia's idea, and was adamant that the cauldron design was his alone, based on a student project he did in 1993. Danny Boyle, artistic director of the opening ceremony, also denied having known about the prior design, while Martin Green, former head of ceremonies of LOCOG, claimed that the idea came out of discussions between Boyle, Heatherwick and himself. The organisers of the London Olympics later reached an out-of-court settlement acknowledging that several key concepts and design features of the cauldron were proposals submitted by Atopia. Heatherwick however maintained that the design was his own and not influenced by Atopia's design. Proposed Thames Garden Bridge Heatherwick designed, in collaboration with the actress Joanna Lumley, a proposed pedestrian bridge across the Thames in central London, the Garden Bridge. The bridge was planned to feature trees and gardens. The project, originally supposed to be fully privately financed, was beset with funding issues, criticisms and delays. In April 2017 Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the Public Accounts Committee, in a report ordered by the Mayor of London, concluded that the project should be cancelled: the ¬£46 million of public money already lost was preferable to risking additional demands if the project proceeded. Hodge criticised the appointments of Heatherwick Studio and engineer Arup in 2013 which \\"were not open, fair or competitive ‚Ä¶ and revealed systematic failures and ineffective control systems\\" The project was officially cancelled on 14 August 2017. Learning Hub The Hive in Singapore The Learning Hub, also known as The Hive, opened in 2015. It is a multi-use educational facility built as part of the Nanyang Technological University's campus redevelopment programme for use by 33,000 students. The building is designed to better suit contemporary methods of learning in response to the use of the internet as a primary educational tool. The design challenges the traditional format of university buildings which have box-like lecture rooms linked by long corridors. Instead, learning facilities and social spaces are interwoven to encourage interaction between users across different disciplines. The building consists of 56 rounded tutorial rooms stacked in 12 towers arranged around a full-height, naturally ventilated atrium The tutorial rooms are conceived to break down student-teacher hierarchies and promote interactive group teaching. The spaces are flexible and can be re-configured, encouraging collaboration between students. Concrete was used as the primary construction material to keep costs down and ensure a high level of environmental performance was achieved. Heatherwick Studio created a bespoke method to imprint three-dimensional texture into the fa√ßade, interior panels and columns using reusable silicone moulds. 700 commissioned drawings by artist and illustrator Sara Fanelli were cast into the elevator cores and stairs. The drawings reference art, literature and science and are meant to act as ambiguous thought triggers for students and teachers. The various raw treatments of concrete used give the building an almost hand-made quality. In 2014, the Learning Hub achieved BREEAM Green Mark Platinum status, the highest environmental rating in Singapore. It also won the British Precast 'Creativity in Concrete' Award from the Concrete Society in 2015. Bombay Sapphire Distillery Bombay Sapphire distillery glasshouses Heatherwick Studio led the masterplan and design for the Bombay Sapphire gin distillery in Hampshire, which opened in 2014. The transformation of the five-acre site included the renovation a 300-year-old paper mill and the restoration 23 existing buildings. In the modernisation scheme, the River Test, which runs through the site, was widened and used as an organisational device. Two curved glasshouses, one with a temperate climate and one with a Mediterranean climate, emerge from the renovated mill building and house the 10 botanicals used in the gin distillation process. Waste heat from the still house is recycled and used to grow the plant species within the glasshouses. Traditional large copper stills are located within the interior, which consists of an educational dry room and bar to accommodate tours and public events. The project was the first facility in the drinks manufacturing industry and the first renovation to achieve BREEAM 'outstanding' accreditation. Coal Drops Yard Coal Drops Yard Coal Drops Yard is a public space and retail destination in King's Cross, London. The project included the renovation of two buildings built in 1850 and used to receive freight arriving from the north of England. The design stitches the two buildings together by extending the two roofs towards each other until they meet. This creates an additional storey and distinct centre to the linear site. The stretched roofs shelter the yard below which can be used to host events, whilst the third storey will offer views of King's Cross, the Francis Crick Institute and Cubitt Square. The project is part of the wider re- development programme for the area by Argent LLP and King's Cross Central Limited Partnership (KCCLP). Coal Drops Yard was approved by planning in December 2015, and was completed in October 2018. Zeitz MOCAA Heatherwick Studio worked on the conversion of the historic Grain Silo at the V&A; Waterfront in Cape Town into a not-for-profit cultural institution, the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA), which houses the most significant collection of contemporary art from Africa and its diaspora. The complex consist of nine floors with of dedicated exhibition space. Using a variety of concrete-cutting techniques, galleries and a large central atrium were carved out of the silo's 42 concrete tubes. The concrete shafts were capped with strengthened glass that can be walked over by visitors, and designed to draw light into the building from above and create a cathedral- like interior. The excavation of this interior space unifies two buildings; the silo and the grading tower. Bisected tubes contain cylindrical lifts and a spiral staircase. Pillowed glazing panels formed of segments of flat glass have been inserted into the upper floors. The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa opened on September 22, 2017. Vessel The Vessel in New York In 2016, Heatherwick's design for the Vessel structure at Hudson Yards' Public Plaza in New York City was unveiled. The structure is in the form of a network of interlocking staircases that visitors can climb up, and its design was inspired by the ancient stepwells of India. It has 2,500 steps in 154 flights of stairs, equivalent to 15 storeys, and it has 80 viewing landings. Construction began in April 2017, and it opened on 15 March 2019. Bund Finance Centre Heatherwick Studio are working in collaboration with Fosters + Partners on the Bund Finance Centre (BFC) ‚Äì a new mixed-use complex in Shanghai. The project is situated at the end of the Bund in Shanghai and envisioned as a connection point between the city's old town and the financial district. The plan includes two that combine offices, a boutique hotel and retail space. An arts and cultural centre is located at the centre of the scheme. Conceived as a platform for international exchange, the centre will feature art galleries and theatre spaces. The building is surrounded by an adaptable moving veil which reveals the stage on the balcony and views towards Pudong district.

Approach to design The Heatherwick Studio has worked with an extensive range of design disciplines, including architecture, engineering, transport and urban planning to furniture, sculpture and product design. According to Heatherwick, the wide range of skill sets found at Heatherwick Studio is a reaction to Heatherwick's frustration at encountering \\"sliced-up ghettos of thought\\" of sculpture, architecture, fashion, embroidery, metalwork, product and furniture design all in separate departments. He considers all design in three dimensions, not as multi- disciplinary design, but as a single discipline: three-dimensional design. Unlike many architecture practices, Heatherwick Studio does not have a fixed style and focuses on problem solving. He has said: ‚ÄúIt is more like solving a crime. The answer is there, and your job is to find it. So we go off and do bits of research that essentially eliminate suspects from the enquiry. And then you follow up leads and gradually narrow down the potential solutions. Ultimately what you‚Äôre left with is the answer.‚Äù Exhibitions and publications In 2012 the Victoria and Albert Museum put on a major retrospective of the studio's work, titled Heatherwick Studio: Designing the Extraordinary, and curated by Abraham Thomas. The exhibition revealed the creative processes and spirit of curiosity of Heatherwick Studio across two decades of projects, spanning the disciplines of architecture, product design, engineering, sculpture, and urban planning. The British Council hosted the major touring exhibition New British Inventors: Inside Heatherwick Studio, curated by Kate Goodwin Drue Heinz Curator of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. In 2015 and 2016 the exhibition travelled to six venues in East Asia and reached over 409,109 visitors. The museums and galleries the exhibition travelled to include: Singapore National Design Centre; CAFA, Beijing; Power Station of Art, Shanghai; PMQ, Hong Kong; Taipei Fine Arts Museum; and D Museum, Seoul. The first US exhibition Provocations: The Architecture and Design of Heatherwick Studio travelled to three venues in North America in 2014 and 2015: Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; and the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, New York City. In 2012, Thames and Hudson published Thomas Heatherwick: Making, a book which laid out Heatherwick's body of work so far. Each of the more than 140 fully illustrated projects included is accompanied by a text explaining, in Heatherwick‚Äôs words, the design question it posed and the creative and practical processes used to address it. A second volume was released in 2013 that includes the Olympic Cauldron. Awards Heatherwick has won numerous design awards including the Prince Philip Designers Prize (2006), the London Design Medal (2010), the RIBA Lubetkin Prize (2010) for the UK Pavilion. In 2004 he became the youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry. Heatherwick has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from University of the Arts London, the Royal College of Art, University of Dundee, University of Brighton, Sheffield Hallam University and Manchester Metropolitan University. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to the design industry. In September 2016 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In 2015, Heatherwick was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men. In 2019, Heatherwick received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Julie Taymor during the International Achievement Summit in New York City.

He went on to wage a scientific bet that no one person could design a motor smaller than 400 ¬µm on any side. The purpose of the bet (as with most scientific bets) was to inspire scientists to develop new technologies, and anyone who could develop a nanomotor could claim the $1,000 USD prize. However, his purpose was thwarted by William McLellan, who fabricated a nanomotor without developing new methods. Nonetheless, Richard Feynman's speech inspired a new generation of scientists to pursue research into nanotechnology. Kinesin uses protein domain dynamics on nanoscales to walk along a microtubule. Nanomotors are the focus of research for their ability to overcome microfluidic dynamics present at low Reynold's numbers. Scallop Theory explains that nanomotors must break symmetry to produce motion at low Reynold's numbers. In addition, Brownian motion must be considered because particle-solvent interaction can dramatically impact the ability of a nanomotor to traverse through a liquid. This can pose a significant problem when designing new nanomotors. Current nanomotor research seeks to overcome these problems, and by doing so, can improve current microfluidic devices or give rise to new technologies.  Nanotube and nanowire motors  In 2004, Ayusman Sen and Thomas E. Mallouk fabricated the first synthetic and autonomous nanomotor. The two-micron long nanomotors were composed of two segments, platinum and gold, that could catalytically react with diluted hydrogen peroxide in water to produce motion. The Au-Pt nanomotors have autonomous, non-Brownian motion that stems from the propulsion via catalytic generation of chemical gradients. As implied, their motion does not require the presence of an external magnetic, electric or optical field to guide their motion. By creating their own local fields, these motors are said to move through self-electrophoresis. Joseph Wang in 2008 was able to dramatically enhance the motion of Au-Pt catalytic nanomotors by incorporating carbon nanotubes into the platinum segment.Speeding up catalytic nanomotors with carbon nanotubes Since 2004, different types of nanotube and nanowire based motors have been developed, in addition to nano- and micromotors of different shapes. Most of these motors use hydrogen peroxide as fuel, but some notable exceptions exist. Metallic microrods (4.3 ¬µm long x 300 nm diameter) can be propelled autonomously in fluids or inside living cells, without chemical fuel, by resonant ultrasound. These rods contain a central Ni stripe that can be steered by an external magnetic field, resulting in \\"synchronized swimming.\\" These silver halide and silver-platinum nanomotors are powered by halide fuels, which can be regenerated by exposure to ambient light. Some nanomotors can even be propelled by multiple stimuli, with varying responses. These multi-functional nanowires move in different directions depending on the stimulus (e.g. chemical fuel or ultrasonic power) applied. For example, bimetallic nanomotors have been shown to undergo rheotaxis to move with or against fluid flow by a combination of chemical and acoustic stimuli. In Dresden Germany, rolled-up microtube nanomotors produced motion by harnessing the bubbles in catalytic reactions. Without the reliance on electrostatic interactions, bubble-induced propulsion enables motor movement in relevant biological fluids, but typically still requires toxic fuels such as hydrogen peroxide. This has limited nanomotors' in vitro applications. One in vivo application, however, of microtube motors has been described for the first time by Joseph Wang and Liangfang Zhang using gastric acid as fuel. Future research into catalytical nanomotors holds major promise for important cargo- towing applications, ranging from cell sorting microchip devices to directed drug delivery. A ribosome is a biological machine that utilizes protein dynamics on nanoscales  Enzymatic nanomotors  Recently, there has been more research into developing enzymatic nanomotors and micropumps. At low Reynold's numbers, single molecule enzymes could act as autonomous nanomotors. Ayusman Sen and Samudra Sengupta demonstrated how self-powered micropumps can enhance particle transportation. This proof-of-concept system demonstrates that enzymes can be successfully utilized as an \\"engine\\" in nanomotors and micropumps. It has since been shown that particles themselves will diffuse faster when coated with active enzyme molecules in a solution of their substrate. Further, it has been seen through microfluidic experiments that enzyme molecules will undergo directional swimming up their substrate gradient. This remains the only method of separating enzymes based on activity alone. Additionally, enzymes in cascade have also shown aggregation based on substrate driven chemotaxis. Developing enzyme-driven nanomotors promises to inspire new biocompatible technologies and medical applications. A proposed branch of research is the integration of molecular motor proteins found in living cells into molecular motors implanted in artificial devices. Such a motor protein would be able to move a \\"cargo\\" within that device, via protein dynamics, similarly to how kinesin moves various molecules along tracks of microtubules inside cells. Starting and stopping the movement of such motor proteins would involve caging the ATP in molecular structures sensitive to UV light. Pulses of UV illumination would thus provide pulses of movement. DNA nanomachines, based on changes between two molecular conformations of DNA in response to various external triggers, have also been described. Helical nanomotors Another interesting direction of research has led to the creation of helical silica particles coated with magnetic materials that can be maneuvered using a rotating magnetic field. Scanning Electron Microscope image of a Helical nanomotor Such nanomotors are not dependent on chemical reactions to fuel the propulsion. A triaxial Helmholtz coil can provide directed rotating field in space. Recent works have shown how such nanomotors can be used to measure viscosity of non-newtonian fluids at a resolution of a few microns. This technology promises creation of viscosity map inside cells and the extracellular milieu. Such nanomotors have been demonstrated to move in blood. Recently, researchers have managed to controllably move such nanomotors inside cancer cells allowing them to trace out patterns inside a cell. Nanomotors moving through the tumor microenvironment have demonstrated the presence of sialic acid in the cancer-secreted extracellular matrix.

Today the Moshava, as it is popularly known, is an upscale neighborhood bisected by Emek Refaim Street, an avenue lined with trendy shops, restaurants and cafes. History Biblical era Emek Refaim (Valley of Refaim) is mentioned in the Book of Joshua and in the Second Book of Samuel. The name is derived from a legendary race of giants who lived in this region in biblical times. Templer settlement Templer Cemetery In 1873, after establishing colonies in Haifa and Jaffa, members of the Templer sect from W√ºrttemberg, Germany, settled on a large tract of land in the Refaim Valley, southwest of the Old City of Jerusalem. The land was purchased by one of the colonists, Matth√§us Frank, from the Arabs of Beit Safafa.\\"Hamoshava Hagermanit Beyerushalayim,\\" Itzik Sweiki, SPNI bulletin, p. 23, teva.org.ilStudies in the Economic and Social History of Palestine in the Nineteenth, by Roger Owen, 1982, Southern Illinois University Press, Page 44 The Templers were Christians who broke away from the Protestant church and encouraged their members to settle in the Holy Land to prepare for Messianic salvation. They built their homes in the style to which they were accustomed in Germany - farmhouses of one or two stories, with slanting tiled roofs and shuttered windows, but using local materials such as Jerusalem stone instead of wood and bricks. The colonists engaged in agriculture and traditional trades such as carpentry and blacksmithing. Their homes ran along two parallel streets that would become Emek Refaim and Bethlehem Road. The British Mandatory government deported the German Templers during World War II. As Germans, they were considered enemy citizens. Some of them resettled in Australia. Christian Arab settlement As the neighborhood expanded south along the valley, many of the lots were purchased by well-to-do Christian Arab families attracted by its location between the road to Bethlehem and the developing neighborhoods of Katamon, Talbiya, and Baka, which were populated by some of Jerusalem's wealthiest Arabs. One of the most famous Christian families in Hebron (Khalil) is Abu Gharbieh, which helped to improve the foundations of the city. State of Israel The Arab residents of Katamon fled in 1948, in the wake of fierce battles for control of the area during the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The abandoned homes in the German Colony and other parts of Katamon were used to house new immigrants. Since the end of the 20th century, the neighborhood has undergone a process of gentrification. Efforts are being made to restore old landmark buildings and incorporate some of their architectural features, such as arched windows and tiled roofs, in new construction. Numerous cafes, bars, restaurants, and boutiques have opened in the neighborhood, and many affluent families have moved there, pushing up the price of real estate. The German Colony has a large English-speaking population, with the English speaking community comprising both families and singles, permanent immigrants and visitors. The neighborhood is home to the Smadar Theater, Jerusalem's arthouse cinema and a perennial gathering place for the artisterati.Discover Jerusalem - German Colony During the Second Intifada, in September 2003, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up outside Caf√© Hillel on Emek Refaim Street, killing seven people. In February 2004, another suicide bombing took place on bus #14a as it was leaving the neighborhood northwards. Eight were killed. A small stone monument was erected on top of the fence of the old train station, facing the location of the attack. It is visible from the main northern entrance to the German Colony, across from Liberty Bell Park. Architecture Lintel with Arabic inscription from 1925 The colorful history of the German Colony is illustrated by the mix of architectural styles found within a relatively small area. One finds Swabian-style homes, examples of late provincial Ottoman architecture and British Art Deco from the Mandatory period, within close proximity. An example of British architecture is the Scottish Hospice and St Andrew's Church, built in 1927, decorated with local Armenian tilework. Some of the Templer homes have biblical inscriptions in German on their lintels, in Fraktur script. Street names The side streets of the German Colony are named for Gentile supporters of Zionism and the Jewish people. Apart from the French author √âmile Zola, Czech president Tomas Masaryk, and South African prime minister Jan Smuts, many of the streets are named for Britons: Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, British Labour Party MP Josiah Wedgwood, H.M. Emperor Charles I of Austria-Hungary, Colonel John Henry Patterson, commander of the Jewish Legion in World War I and the pro-Zionist British general Wyndham Deedes.  Parks and Green Spaces  The Park HaMesila (Train Track Park) runs along the German Colony's southern border with Baka. This former train track was converted into a park approximately 7km in length and the portion that borders the German Colony has been extensively landscaped.

It rises in the township of Low and Burbank's Grant and runs generally northwest along U.S. Highway 2, traversing the towns of Jefferson and Lancaster, before joining the Connecticut River. History The Abenaki people called the river Siwooganock, which means \\"place of the burnt pine trees\\". The first name given to the river by English settlers was \\"Powers River\\" in honor of Captain Peter Powers (1707-1757), who in 1754 became the first to explore this area. The present name comes from an early hunter and trapper named Israel Glines, whose camp was situated near the outlet of the river. The Johns River, in the nearby town of Whitefield, is named for Israel's brother John. Description The Israel River rises near the foot of Mount Adams, at the juncture of Castle Brook and Cascade Brook. With its numerous tributaries, the river drains the northwestern slopes of Mount Adams and Mt. Jefferson in the Presidential Range, the northern slopes of the Dartmouth Range, and the southern slopes of the Pliny Range. The larger tributaries include the South Branch, The Mystic, Castle Brook, Cascade Brook, Stag Hollow Brook, Stanley Brook, Priscilla Brook, Alder Brook (also called Crawford Brook), Red Brook, Mill Brook, Garland Brook (which still turns a working saw mill) and Otter Brook. Major highway bridges over the river include New Hampshire Route 115, U.S. Route 2 and New Hampshire Route 115A in Jefferson, and U.S. Route 3 on Main Street in Lancaster. A number of smaller bridges are provided for snowmobile trails, and there is an old covered bridge on Mechanic Street in Lancaster (closed in 2004 for major repairs and since reopened).

This technology replaces the traditional mechanical control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and steering feel emulators. Components such as the steering column, intermediate shafts, pumps, hoses, belts, coolers and vacuum servos and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the fly-by-wire systems used widely in the aviation industry. Examples include electronic throttle control and brake- by-wire.  Advantages  First, the electronic throttle system is significantly lighter, reducing weight in modern cars. They are easier to service and tune, as a technician can simply connect a computer and let the computer perform the tuning. Also, using an electronic control system allows for much more precise control of the throttle opening compared to a cable that stretches over time. It also allows the throttle response to be programmed in by the manufacturers. Because the steering wheel can be bypassed as an input device, safety can be improved by providing computer controlled intervention of vehicle controls with systems such as electronic stability control (ESC), adaptive cruise control and Lane Assist Systems. Some systems, with appropriate modification, allow for control by laptops or even game controllers. Ergonomics can be improved by the amount of force and range of movement required by the driver and by greater flexibility in the location of controls. This flexibility also significantly expands the number of options for the vehicle's design.  Disadvantages  Drive by wire systems can be \\"hacked\\", and their control faulted or shut off, by either wired or wireless connections. Each drive-by-wire system leads to more motors in the vehicle and therefore a greater energy consumption. For instance, the drive-by-wire technology adds actuator motors to create the torque needed to turn the wheels, and a feedback transducer to create the \\"road feel\\" on the steering wheel. Another disadvantage of the drive-by-wire system is the noticeable delay between hitting the gas pedal and feeling the engine respond, caused by the drive-by-wire system's inherent propagation delays. However, in recent years a range of \\"throttle controllers\\" have hit the market to counteract this lag; such as the iDRIVE and Windbooster Throttle Controllers. The drive by wire paradigm abandons the fail safe tradition of such components as power steering where the potential for failure of a sophisticated approach is covered by the ability of the simpler underlying mechanical system to provide backup functionality.  Uses in passenger cars   Throttle by wire  This system helps accomplish vehicle propulsion by means of an electronic throttle without any cables from the accelerator pedal to the throttle valve of the engine. In electric vehicles, this system controls the electric motors by sensing the accelerator pedal input and sending commands to the power inverter modules.  Brake by wire  A pure brake by wire system would eliminate the need for hydraulics completely by using motors to actuate calipers, in comparison to the currently existing technology where the system is designed to provide braking effort by building hydraulic pressure in the brake lines.  Shift by wire  The direction of motion of the vehicle (Forward, Reverse) is set by commanding the actuators inside the transmission through electronic commands based on the current input from the driver (Park, Reverse, Neutral or Drive).  Steer by wire  European Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger trying Uniti steer-by-wire system at the 2016 CeBit Edition. This kind of system will provide steering control to a car with fewer mechanical components/linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels. The control of the wheels' direction will be established through electric motor(s) which are actuated by electronic control units monitoring the steering wheel inputs from the driver. Such a system is illegal in most jurisdictions for passenger or commercial vehicles. The first production vehicle to implement this was the Infiniti Q50., but after negative comments they retrofitted the traditional hydraulic steering. Its implementation in road vehicles is limited by concerns over reliability although it has been demonstrated in several concept vehicles such as ThyssenKrupp Presta Steering's Mercedes-Benz Unimog, General Motors' Hy-wire and Sequel, Saabs Prometheus and the Mazda Ryuga. A rear wheel SbW system by Delphi called Quadrasteer is used on some pickup trucks but has had limited commercial success. The Swedish startup Uniti will release the Uniti all electric car in 2019 with an in-house designed steer-by- wire system and will entirely replace the steering wheel. The concept was showcased in VR at the 2016 CeBit edition. This is not to be confused with Electric Power Steering. Electric Power Steering can be considered as a stage of evolution from mechanical steering to steer by wire systems.  Park by wire  The parking pawl in a traditional automatic transmission has a mechanical link to the gear lever and locks the transmission in the park position when the vehicle is set in Park. Not to be confused with the parking brake. A park by wire system uses electronic commands to actuate the parking pawl by a motor when the driver puts the vehicle in park.  Safety critical systems  Failures in electronic control units used to implement these drive by wire functionalists can lead to potential hazardous situations where the driver's ability to control the vehicle will depend on the vehicle operating scenario. For example, unintended acceleration, loss of braking, unintended steering, shift in the wrong direction and unintended roll away are some of the known hazards. Implementing drive by wire systems requires extensive testing and validation as is the case when any new technology is introduced. Recently it has been demonstrated that some of these systems are susceptible to hacking, allowing for external control of the vehicle. While generally such hack demonstrations like remote activation of the horn or windshield wipers/washers fall into the \\"annoying or amusing\\" category, other hacks involving the accelerator, brakes, and transmission have much more serious security and safety implications.

The plane used Boeing's 707-320C as reference, designed according to Federal Aviation Regulation (Part 25, 1970 edition).‰∏äÊµ∑Ê∞ëÁî®Ëà™Á©∫‰∫ß‰∏öÂèëÂ±ïÁ†îÁ©∂ÔºåP7, Due to unavailability of the intended WS-8 turbofan engines the prototype aircraft used Pratt & Whitney JT3D-7 turbofan engines, acquired as spare engines for CAAC's small fleet of Boeing 707 aircraft. The cabin could be configured to seat 178 in high-density, 149 in economy, or 124 in mixed-class and the large flight deck accommodated five crew members: pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navigator, and radio operator. History Development work, given code name 708, began in Shanghai in August, 1970 for Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The plane was intended to serve as a demonstrator and help the Chinese industry obtain experience in large aircraft design and flight testing. The Y-10 development costs totalled 537.7 million yuan. The Chinese government prided itself on the program, citing a Reuters report which said, \\"After developing this kind of highly complex technology, one could no longer regard China as a backward country.\\" The project was heavily tainted by politics from the beginning because it was spearheaded by Wang Hongwen, one of the Gang of Four. The strategic vision of an independently developed large transport plane had long been voiced by Mao Zedong and, in 2006, a similar project with updated design goals made its way into the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, periodic strategic socio-economical development plans drawn up by the Chinese government. Three aircraft were built by the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Factory (now known as Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Company) at Dachang Air Base north of Shanghai. The first prototype (01) was used for static testing, the second prototype (02) was used for flight testing and the third (03) for fatigue testing. The plane first flew on September 26, 1980, making 130 flights with 170 hours of flying time, visiting Beijing, Harbin, Urumqi, Zhengzhou, Hefei, Guangzhou, Kunming, Lhasa and Chengdu before its retirement in 1984. The Y-10 is an indigenous Chinese design. In 1970, the factory got a Pakistan Boeing 707 crashed in Hetian, Xinjiang to study it.Ëøê-10Á†îÂà∂ÁªèÁ∫¨Ë∞à. While the planes were reverse- engineered copies of the Boeing 707--one report claimed that after Chinese engineers disassembled a 707 to study it, neither the reassembled original nor the copy would fly--both the Y-10's designers and Boeing denied this. While the Y-10 resembles the 707, its dimensions are closer to the Boeing 720 than the 707, and the internal design is very different. By the time the prototype was first flown, debate about its viability surfaced, based on a design that was already 30 years old. CAAC, which already owned a modest Western fleet, would not purchase the plane. China was beginning to embrace trade with the West, and some saw the isolationist design as an inefficient throwback to Maoism. China in the early reform era was ruled by rehabilitated cadres previously persecuted in the Cultural Revolution by Wang Hongwen, the project initiator, resulting in the cancellation of the project in 1983, officially due to cost and market concerns. During its maiden flights, no governmental officials attended the ceremonies for fear of the connection to Wang Hongwen and the Gang of Four. By 1985, Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Factory had been granted production licensing for the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and shifted all efforts towards that program. A model of an AWACS variant has been seen, resembling the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft.

In addition to his major contributions to plant systematics, he is also remembered for his skills as an ethnographer and his frequent defense of Ambonese peoples against colonialism. Early life Memorial plaque in W√∂lfersheim Rumphius was the oldest son of August Rumpf, a builder and engineer in Hanau, and Anna Elisabeth Keller, sister of Johann Eberhard Keller, governor of the Dutch-speaking Kleve (Cleves), at that time a district of the Electorate (Kurf√ºrstentum) of Brandenburg. He was baptized Georg Eberhard Rumpf in W√∂lfersheim, where he grew up. He went to the Gymnasium in Hanau. Though born and raised in Germany he spoke and wrote in Dutch from an early age, probably as learned from his mother. He was recruited by the West India Company, ostensibly to serve the Republic of Venice, but was put on a ship \\"De Swarte Raef\\" (The Black Raven) in 1646 bound for Brazil where the Dutch and Portuguese were fighting over territory. Either through shipwreck or capture he landed in Portugal, where he remained for nearly three years. Around 1649 he returned to Hanau where he helped his father's business. Merchant of Ambon Rumphius's Ambon house in the 1910s. A week after his mother's funeral (20 December 1651) he left Hanau for the last time. Perhaps through contacts of his mother's family, he enlisted with the Dutch East Indies Company (as Jeuriaen Everhard Rumpf) and left as a midshipman on 26 December 1652 aboard the ship Muyden for the Dutch East Indies. He arrived in Batavia in July 1653, and proceeded to the Ambon archipelago in 1654. By 1657 his official title was \\"engineer and ensign\\", at which point he requested a transfer to the civilian branch of the company and became second merchant (\\"onderkoopman\\") on Hitu island, north of Ambon. He became a merchant (\\"koopman\\") in 1662. He then started to undertake a study of the flora and fauna of these Spice Islands. In 1666 he was appointed as \\"secunde\\" at Ambon directly under Joan Maetsuycker, the governor-general in Batavia, who would later give him dispensation from his ordinary duties to complete this study. Maetsuycker was a barrister-at-law and a patron of science. He would become known as Plinius Indicus (the Pliny of the Indies). This was the name under which he was made a member by the Academia Naturae Curiosorum in Vienna in 1681. Herbarium Amboinense Illustration of Durian from Herbarium Amboinense Rumphius is best known for his authorship of Het Amboinsche kruidboek or Herbarium Amboinense, a catalogue of the plants of the island of Amboina (in modern-day Indonesia), published posthumously in 1741. The work covers 1,200 species, 930 with definite species names, and another 140 identified to genus level. The publication of this book was possible because of the governor Johannes Camphuys. Camphuys, an amateur astronomer, personally reviewed the manuscript and ensured a copy was made before the ill-fated manuscript was sent off to Europe for printing. Rumphius provided illustrations and descriptions for nomenclature types for 350 plants, and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus. His book provided the basis for all future study of the flora of the Moluccas and his work is still referred to today. Despite the distance, he was in communication with scientists in Europe, was a member of a scientific society in Vienna, and even sent a collection of Moluccan sea shells to the Medicis in Tuscany. Wreath laid at the Rumphius memorial on Ambon (c. 1930) After going blind in 1670 due to glaucoma, Rumphius continued work on his six-volume manuscript with the help of others. His wife and a daughter were killed by a wall collapse during a major earthquake and tsunami on 17 February 1674. On 11 January 1687, with the project nearing completion, a great fire in the town destroyed his library, numerous manuscripts, original illustrations for his Herbarium Amboinense, volumes of the Hortus Malabaricus, and works by Jacobus Bontius. Persevering, Rumphius and his helpers first completed the book in 1690, but the ship carrying the manuscript to the Netherlands was attacked and sunk by the French, forcing them to start over from a copy that had fortunately been retained thanks to Camphuys. The Herbarium Amboinense finally arrived in the Netherlands in 1696. However, \\"the East India Company decided that it contained so much sensitive information that it would be better not to publish it.\\" Rumphius died in 1702, so he never saw his work in print; the embargo was lifted in 1704, but then no publisher could be found for it. It finally appeared in 1741, thirty-nine years after Rumphius's death through the work of Johannes Burman (1707‚Äì79) who translated it into Latin. Much of the natural history in Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n (\\"Old and New East-India\\") by Fran√ßois Valentijn was by Rumphius and they were close friends. Illustration of critique of D'Amboinische Rariteitkamer... published in Acta Eruditorum, 1706 The Herbarium Amboinense as published in 1741 consisted of six large folio volumes. Being blind, Rumphius required the assistance of others to produce it. His wife, Suzanna, was one of the early assistants and she was commemorated in Flos Suzannae a white orchid (now Pecteilis susannae) described by Rumphius. His son Paul August made many of the plant illustrations as also the only known portrait of Rumphius. Other assistants included Philips van Eyck, a draughtsman, Daniel Crul, Pieter de Ruyter a soldier trained by Van Eyck, Johan Philip Sipman, Christiaen Gieraerts J. Hoogeboom An English translation, which took seven years to make by E. M. Beekman, was posthumously published in 2011. The coconut crab illustrated in D'Amboinsche Rariteitkamer Among the many species described in the Herbarium was the Upas tree (Antiaris toxicaria), the toxicity of the tree was exaggerated and caught the fancy of Europeans. Other plants included a description of the clove, the starfruit and durian. Rumphius used multinomial names and his descriptions were largely missed by Linnaeus as he received it after he had worked on Species Plantarum. Rumphius was the first to interpret the function of the pitchers in pitcher plants. He also discovered that some mosquitoes bred in their pools. He also analysed edible nest swiftlets and came to the conclusion that the substance was produced by the swiftlets and not marine algae as had been earlier believed. The other major work D'Amboinsche Rariteitkamer (\\"Amboinese Cabinet of Curiosities\\"), a manuscript he had sent to Dr Hendrik D'Acquet of Delft in 1701 consisted mainly of plates of seashells and crabs. After Rumphius' death, his son Paul August was appointed \\"merchant of Amboina\\", the position his father had held. A monument was erected to the memory of Rumphius at Amboina but this was destroyed by the English who believed they would find gold under it. In 1824 a second monument was built by Governor-General van der Capellen but this was destroyed by a bomb in World War II. Works The cover of D‚ÄôAmboinense Rariteikamer which published in 1704.

Early years In 1796, John Redpath was born at Earlston, Berwickshire. According to surviving records, he was the son of Peter Redpath, a farm worker, and his second wife Elizabeth Pringle, from neighbouring Gordon, Berwickshire.A Gentleman of Substance: The Life and Legacy of John Redpath (1796-1869) By Richard Feltoe Redpath was born during the period of the Lowland Clearances that created economic hardship and dislocation for many Scottish families. As such, after gaining valuable experience as a stonemason with George Drummond in Edinburgh, the twenty-year-old Redpath emigrated to Canada. In 1816, with limited funds for ship passage, the nearly penniless Redpath disembarked at Quebec City before walking barefoot to Montreal, Quebec. Once there, he used the trade he had learnt back in Scotland to gain him employment in the construction industry, working as a stonemason. In November of that year, Redpath witnessed the first installation of oil streetlamps in the city on Rue Saint-Paul. Business career A man of integrity with a prodigious work ethic and a keen business sense, within a few years Redpath was running his own sizeable construction business. He was involved in major projects such as the construction of the Lachine Canal and locks that proved key to future commercial development of the city of Montreal. Beginning in 1689, attempts were made by the French Colonial government and several others to build a canal that would allow ships to bypass the treacherous Lachine Rapids. After more than 130 years of failure, with funding from the recently formed Bank of Montreal, the consortium, of which Redpath was a major part, was successful in its construction and the new canal officially opened in 1825. The Lachine canal substantially increased shipping, turning Montreal into one of the largest ports in North America. Because the land along the canal belonged to the Roman Catholic Sulpician Order it remained unused for another twenty years until Redpath and other businessmen were finally able to purchase plots along the canal. As a result of the land being opened to development, on the canal's banks came the construction of large new manufacturing plants, drawn there because of the ready source of water from the canal that could be used in the production process and provide the steam power to drive machinery. It was these industries, including Redpath's construction of the first sugar refinery in Canada, that made Montreal the industrial metropolis of Canada and by the time of his death, John Redpath witnessed traffic go from 600 small vessels passing through the canal each year to more than 13,000 large ships. Redpath's house, Terrace Bank, on Sherbrooke Street, Montreal John Redpath's success in building the Lachine Canal led to further major projects including his partnering with Thomas McKay, to construct the locks at Jones Falls, Ontario on the giant Rideau Canal project between 1827 and 1828. In addition, Redpath built the Notre-Dame Basilica and some of the first buildings at McGill University. The Redpath Sugar refinery proved to be a major Montreal employer, within a few years annually processing approximately 7,000 tons of raw sugar imported from the West Indies aboard Redpath-owned ships. Originally called the Canada Sugar Refining Co., after his son Peter (1821‚Äì1894) joined the business the company's name was changed to John Redpath & Son. Four years later in 1861, Redpath's son-in-law George Alexander Drummond (1829‚Äì1910) also joined the company. In addition to his own industrial enterprises, Redpath invested in numerous businesses that greatly benefited the Montreal economy. In addition to his own cargo vessels to serve his sugar refinery, he had investments in the Montreal Towboat Company. He also helped finance the Montreal Telegraph Company and the Montreal Fire Assurance Company, serving as a director of both companies. He also committed substantial funds to develop the economies of Quebec's Eastern Townships, including investments in the Capel Copper operations, the Belvedere Mining and Smelting Company, Rockland Slate Company, Bear Creek Coal, and Melbourne Slate Co. As a result of his business acumen, in 1833 Redpath was invited to serve on the Board of Directors of the Bank of Montreal, a position he would hold for 36 years. Canada has always had a very small population and in the developing years of the early 19th century, that small population meant there was limited financial resources for business to draw upon. Because major business development was still dependent upon funding from the London Stock Exchange, Redpath understood the need for Canada to begin the long process of developing its own capital markets. As such, he was a promoter of the Montreal Investment Association, the forerunner of the Montreal Stock Exchange. Coming from the Scottish working class Redpath had an inherent mistrust of the aristocratic power structure in England and did not view England as the mother country as other Canadians such as Robert Baldwin did. Numerous complaints by business officials in the Canadian colony were ignored by the British authorities and the situation became intolerable when the government in London decided to abolish tariffs that protected Lower Canada producers from the established and well-financed British companies. Understanding that fighting these powerful forces in Britain was costly and nearly impossible, along with other businessmen who had invested in Canada, Redpath lent his support to the Annexation Movement in Canada in an effort to leverage the situation. This group promoted the idea of the Canadian Provinces joining the United States, an idea that had been touted on prior occasions. It had been unfair taxes and tariffs that led to the American Revolution and while the Annexation Movement was short-lived, the growing support for such an idea, particularly from powerful men like Redpath, John Molson, Louis-Joseph Papineau, and Alexander Galt, caused the British authorities to make changes that resulted in the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty of 1854. Political career and philanthropy Jane Drummond Beyond business, charity and community service played a large role in Redpath's life. He was sat on Montreal City Council from 1840 until 1843. During this time, he ceded the land which became Drummond Street on May 13, 1842 and named the street after his second wife, Jane Drummond (1816-1907). The street was not named after Genersl Gordon Drummond (no relation), as is sometimes thought.Ville de Montr√©al, Les rues de Montr√©al, R√©pertoire historique. √âditions du M√©ridien. 1995, p. 151 Redpath was also a director of such charitable institutions as the Montreal General Hospital. He was one of the founders of the Protestant House of Industry and Refuge and a major donor to the Canada Foreign Missionary Society and the French-Canadian Missionary Society. Redpath was a supporter of the 1833 law that abolished slavery in the British colonies and served as the head of a small group that lobbied for government assistance to fight Montreal's \\"white slavery\\" traffic, working with the Magdalen Asylum in Montreal to aid impoverished immigrant women forced into prostitution. Having had limited education, Redpath was a strong advocate of learning. He helped establish The Presbyterian College, Montreal and the Montreal Mechanics Institute, now the Atwater Library. John Redpath was also a benefactor of the first endowment fund established for McGill University. His son Peter also endowed a Chair of Mathematics at the university as well as building the university's Redpath Museum and Redpath Library. John Redpath's funeral monument in Mount Royal Cemetery. Personal Redpath was first married in 1818 to Janet McPhee, a native of Glengarry, Ontario, and they had ten children before her death in 1834. The following year he married 20-year-old Scottish-born Jane Drummond, and they had seven children. Redpath built a large family home overlooking Montreal on the slopes of Mount Royal, having purchased it from the Desrivi√®res family who had lost a long court case against the trustees of what was to become McGill University. The area still carries the Redpath name: rue Redpath, croissant Redpath, place Redpath. Following his death in 1869, Redpath was interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. Legacy In May 2019, Toronto's poet laureate, Albert Moritz, composed a new poem that reused four lines from a poem John Redpath composed in 1858. The Redpath Sugar company had requested Moritz compose his poem to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Redpath Sugar Refinery on Toronto's waterfront. The poem stirred controversy, and Redpath Sugar declined to have Moritz read it at the celebration ceremony because it touched on the sugar industry's early reliance on slave labour.

Life Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well Strozzi was born in Genoa. He is not believed to be related to the Florentine Strozzi family. Bernardo Strozzi initially trained in the workshop of Cesare Corte, a minor Genoese painter whose work reflected the late Mannerist style of Luca Cambiaso. He subsequently joined the workshop of Pietro Sorri, an innovative Sienese painter residing in Genoa from 1596 to 1598. Sorri is credited with leading Strozzi away from the artificial elegance of Cambiaso's late Mannerist style towards a greater naturalism.Genoa : drawings and prints, 1530-1800, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1996, p. 85-89 In 1598, at the age of 17, Strozzi joined a Capuchin monastery, a reformist offshoot of the Franciscan order. During this time he likely painted devotional compositions for the order, including many scenes with St. Francis of Assisi whose life and deeds formed the inspiration of the order.Adoration of Shepherds at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore While a monk of the Capuchin monastery of San Barnaba he came to be called by the nickname 'il Cappuccino' (the 'Capuchin monk').Bernardo Strozzi, St. Catherine of Alexandria at the Columbia Museum of Art Since he was allowed to abandon his Capuchin habit for that of a priest, he was also known as il prete genovese (the 'genovese priest').Bernardo Strozzi, ‚Äò‚ÄôSaint Paul‚Äô‚Äô at Galerie Canesso Paris When his father died around 1608, Strozzi left the Capuchin monastery to care for his mother and unmarried sister. He supported his family through his paintings. Strozzi's career took off during the next decade and Genoa's powerful Doria and Centurione families became his patrons. Bernardo Strozzi was able to secure commissions for grand mural decorations, which culminated in the important frescoes in the choir of the San Domenico church, commissioned by members of the Doria family, Giovanni Carlo and his cousin Giovanni Stefano. The work is now almost entirely destroyed and is only known through a preparatory oil bozzetto for the vault depicting ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Vision of Saint Dominic (Paradise)‚Äô‚Äô, located at the Museo dell‚ÄôAccademia Ligustica in Genoa. It is believed that from the end of April until the end of July 1625 he resided in Rome, to which he had been summoned by the friars of his order to support their attempt to create a stronger Capuchin presence in the papal city. The flute player From the year 1625 Strozzi's relationship with the Capuchin order became strained. The order accused him of having committed a no longer known act that had purportedly caused 'disgrace to his sacred habit'.Bernardo Strozzi, Head of a Young Man at Adam Williams Fine Art Ltd. Some authors state that the act was the illegal practice of painting beyond the convent's walls. It is known that his Capuchin superiors condemned the secular paintings he was making such as his portraits and genre paintings. The conflict came to a head in 1630 when Strozzi refused to go back to the monastery following his mother's death and his sister's marriage. His superiors then had him imprisoned. His arrest lasted for about 17 to 18 months. By 1632-1633 the artist had reemerged in Venice where he had been allowed to work and live. Strozzi was able to build a strong reputation within two years, despite not being a native Venetian. He gradually gained recognition as one of the leading artists of his age. The Doge of Venice Francesco Erizzo became one of his most prominent patrons. Strozzi likely painted the Doge's portrait soon after he arrived in Venice. Other patrons included the Catholic Cardinal and Patriarch of Venice Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Cornaro and some members of the prominent Grimani family, as well as prominent Venetian artists such as the musicians Claudio Monteverdi and Barbara Strozzi and the poet Giulio Strozzi (it is unclear whether the two families were closely related). The artist worked on important public commissions. He realised altarpieces in the Chiesa degli Incurabili and the Chiesa di San Nicol√≤ da Tolentino and painted a tondo representing an Allegory of Sculpture for the reading room of the Biblioteca Marciana. Strozzi was allowed the use of the honorific Monsignor although he remained known generally under the popular il prete genovese. Calling of St Matthew His many pupils and the large number of his paintings, which often appear in many versions, point to his reliance on the help of several assistants and the operation of a sizable workshop. Francesco Durello, Antonio Travi, Ermanno Stroiffi, Clemente Bocciardo, Giovanni Eismann, Giuseppe Catto and Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari are recorded as his pupils. At the end of his career he also worked as an engineer. The artist died in Venice in 1644. Work General Bernardo Strozzi was a versatile and prolific artist who worked on canvas and as a fresco artist. He treated a wide range of subjects including history, allegories, genre scenes and portraits. He also worked as a still life painter and various of his compositions include still life elements. Religious compositions make up the majority of his works. Although also active as a fresco artist, he achieved greater success with his canvas paintings. Many of his paintings appear in multiple autograph copies produced by Strozzi himself as was customary at the time. Stylistic development The Healing of Tobit Strozzi continued to develop his style throughout his career. His art drew its early inspiration from the rich variety of styles flourishing in Genoa around the turn of the 17th century. Starting in a style which borrowed from the artificial elegance of Cambiaso's late Mannerist style he gradually developed toward a greater naturalism. Strozzi had early on absorbed the Tuscan Mannerist style through his teacher Sorri as well as the style of Milanese Mannerist painting. As a result, the influence of local Mannerism is sometimes difficult to separate from that of Lombard Mannerists. The Mannerism is expressed in the works of this early period in the elongated and curved figures, the tapering fingers, the inclined heads and the abstract patterns of draperies. In the 1620s Strozzi gradually abandoned his early Mannerist style in favor of a more personal style characterized by a new naturalism derived from the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The Caravaggist style of painting had been brought to Genoa both by Domenico Fiasella, after his return from Rome in 1617‚Äì18, and by followers of Caravaggio who spent time working in the city, including Orazio Gentileschi, Orazio Borgianni, Angelo Caroselli and Bartolomeo Cavarozzi. Strozzi's Calling of St Matthew (c. 1620, Worcester Art Museum)Calling of St Matthew at the Worcester Art Museum is particularly close to Caravaggio in style and treatment of this subject, while still retaining certain Mannerist characteristics. Lute Player His exposure to the work of Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens and other Flemish artists resident or passing through Genoa contributed to a growing naturalism and a definitive rejection of the Mannerist tendencies in his work. Warmer colors started to dominate while he developed a bolder and more painterly technique. In his composition St. Lawrence Distributing the Riches of the Church (c. 1625, Saint Louis Art Museum) the artist achieved a clear and lucid treatment of space and an accurate definition of form by the use of light and shade. The impasto in this work had become even thicker than before. By the end of the 1620s, Strozzi had started to synthesize a personal style which fused painterly influences of the North (including Rubens and Veronese) with a monumental, realistic starkness. Venice infused his painting with a gentler edge, a style more acceptable to the local patronage, and one derived from his precursors in Venice, Jan Lys and Domenico Fetti, who had also fused the influence of Caravaggio into Venetian art. Veronese's art inspired him to adopt a bolder and more luminous palette. An example of this style can be found in his Parable of the Wedding Guests (1636, Accademia ligustica di belle arti).Parable of the Wedding Guests at the National Gallery, Australia His style continued at the same time to reveal the strong influence of Rubens as is shown in Allegorical figure (Minerva?) (mid-1630s, Cleveland Museum of Art), which unites the robust forms and brilliant colours of Rubens with the warm atmosphere of Venetian art. Portrait of a Maltese Knight His latest works are luminous and sketchy, as can be seen in the David with the Head of Goliath (after 1640, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) and the Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well (after 1630, Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden). His Lute Player (after 1640; Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna) exudes a poetic mood likely derived from his study of the work of Giorgione. Portraits Strozzi was a sought after portrait painter who portrayed the leading aristocratic, clerical and artistic figures of his time. In the late 1630s he was invited to participate in the creation of a series of portraits of distinguished members of the prominent Genoese Raggi family. Other artists invited to participate in this project included Antony van Dyck, Jan Roos, Luciano Borzone and Gioacchino Assereto. About 14 portraits from this series have survived. Although created by different artists, the portraits reveal a certain unity in their arrangements that goes back to van Dyck's models. Strozzi painted more portraits than any other artist participating in the series. This may point to Strozzi's special relationship with the patron.Bernardo Strozzi, Portrait of Nicol√≤ Raggi at Robilant+Voena Genre paintings Strozzi was likely inspired by Flemish genre scenes as well as the Caravaggist models to create a group of genre works. Best known of these works is The Cook which exists in many versions (c. 1625, Palazzo Rosso, Genoa, and 1630‚Äì40, the Scottish National Gallery).Giuseppe Pacciarotti, La pintura barroca en Italia, Ediciones Akal, 2000, p. 389 This work goes back to Pieter Aertsen's The Cook (1559; Palazzo Bianco, Genoa) as well as the work of Jan Roos. These works reveal an intention to represent daily life without attaching any meaningful allusions. The Cook His boisterous The flute player (Palazzo Rosso, Genoa), which also exists in several replicas, is another genre painting that shows its indebtedness to Flemish genre art in its subject, palette and painterly technique.Bernardo Strozzi, Pifferaio at Musei di Strada Nuova - Palazzo Rosso Strozzi's use of coloured shadows is indebted to Rubens, but rather than adopting Rubens' practice of allowing a light-coloured ground to occasionally emerge on to the surface, Strozzi worked on a reddish-brown ground with light brushstrokes in paler colours. Still lifes Bernardo Strozzi's career as a still-life painter is still not very well understood and there remains confusion over his artistic development in this genre. His relationship with still-life painters from Lucca such as Simone del Tintore and Paolo Paolini whom he is likely to have met during his supposed trip to Rome in 1625 is not yet fully understood.Bernardo Strozzi, Still life with pink and white peonies in a glass vase and peaches, white roses and fruits on a ledge at Sotheby's It is known that he painted still lifes throughout his career and included still life elements in many of his compositions. An example are the still lifes of game in his work The Cook. Still life with flowers in a glass vase and fruits on a ledge The Still life with flowers in a glass vase and fruits on a ledge (At Sotheby's on 3 July 2013 London, lot 35) is one of the few still lifes by Strozzi that is generally accepted as fully autograph. The design is simple as most objects are placed on a similar pictorial plane. The composition invokes Caravaggio's Still life of fruits and flowers in a basket (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan ) in the gentle light entering the scene from the left and the cream background. As was his custom, Strozzi applied the paint thickly throughout the design. Influence Bernardo Strozzi's work exercised considerable influence on artistic developments in both Genoa and Venice. He is considered a principal founder of the Venetian Baroque style. Painters in Genoa strongly influenced by Strozzi included Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari, Giovanni Bernardo Carbone, Valerio Castello, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and Gioacchino Assereto.Della origine e delle vicende della pittura in Padova, by Giannantonio Moschini, Tipografia Crescini, Padua (1826), page 106 In Venice, Ermanno Stroiffi, Francesco Maffei, Girolamo Forabosco and certain works by Pietro della Vecchia (also known as Pietro Muttoni) also show the influence of Strozzi. He is further been regarded as a possible influence on the Spanish painter Murillo, who may have known his work such as the Veronica (1620-1625, Museo del Prado, Madrid).Bernardo Strozzi at the Prado Further reading *Gavazza, E. et al., eds.,Bernardo Strozzi, Genova 1581/82-Venezia 1644 (exhibition catalogue, Palazzo Ducale, Genoa), Milan, 1995 *Spicer, J., ed., Bernardo Strozzi: Master Painter of the Italian Baroque (exhibition catalogue, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), Baltimore 1995 *Pallucchini, A., La pittura veneziana del Seicento, Milan 1993 *Krawietz, C., \\"Bernardo Strozzi\\", in The Dictionary of Art (ed. by Jan Shoaf Turner), London, 1996 *Hansen, M.S. and J.Spicer, eds., Masterpieces of Italian Painting, The Walters Art Museum, London 2005, no. 43 *Camillo Manzitti, \\"Gioacchino Assereto: tangenze giovanili con Bernardo Strozzi e nuove testimonianze figurative\\", in \\"Paragone, n. 663, Maggio 2005. * References External links  * 1580s births 1644 deaths People from Genoa 16th-century Italian painters Italian male painters 17th-century Italian painters Genoese painters Italian Baroque painters Capuchins ","title":"Bernardo Strozzi"},{"id":"1390418","text":"Piece of Cake is a 1983 novel by Derek Robinson which follows a fictional Royal Air Force fighter squadron through the first year of World War II, and the Battle of Britain. It was later made into the 1988 television serial Piece of Cake. Although a work of fiction, the novel purports to be as historically accurate as possible. Notable themes are the development of aerial warfare tactics, the Hawker Hurricane fighter, the British class system within its military, and the difficulty of training and integrating new pilots during wartime. The novel was controversial because it challenged the greatly inflated British claims of Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed during the Battle of Britain, and theorized that the air battle was \\"irrelevant\\" to the possibility of a Nazi invasion of Britain following the fall of France. Robinson defends his work by stating that the truth of \\"faults and deficiencies\\" only enhances admiration for the courage and resilience of RAF pilots. Plot summary September 1939, World War II is about to begin: The young, brash and inexperienced pilots of Hornet Squadron, a fighter unit of the British Royal Air Force's Fighter Command and equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk. 1s, are not inclined to take the impending war very seriously. Squadron Leader Ramsey, who has been drilling his men hard, is eager to get into action. Returning from a practise flight, he inadvertently taxis his Hurricane into a slit-trench, upending the aircraft and, too impatient to wait for a ladder, falls from the cockpit and fatally breaks his neck. His temporary replacement is New Zealander 'Fanny' Barton whose authority is rejected by most of the pilots. Ordered to intercept an incoming group of aircraft, Barton attacks what he believes is a German bomber and shoots it down, only to later realise it was a British Blenheim. He is sent away to face a court of enquiry whilst Squadron Leader Rex, an upper-crust and calmly confident pilot, arrives to take command. The squadron is despatched to a new airfield in France to await the expected German attack. Billeted in a luxury chateau, the pilots enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. In return, Rex expects strict discipline amongst his pilots and adherence to the textbook tactics of the RAF including close- formation flying and the cumbersome 'fighting area' attacks. The Phoney-War begins as winter sets in. Pilot Officer 'Moggy' Cattermole bullies several of the other pilots, in particularly young Dickie Starr and mentally fragile 'Sticky' Stickwell. Cattermole flies his Hurricane under a low bridge, goading Starr and 'Pip' Patterson to do the same. Starr attempts the stunt and is killed. Cattermole shows no remorse. A new replacement arrives, an American named Christopher Hart the Third, soon nicknamed 'CH3'. A veteran of the Spanish Civil War, he is unimpressed with the rigid, by-the-book tactics of the RAF and this leads to disagreements and hostility with some of the other pilots. Barton also returns to the squadron. Hornet achieves its first aerial victory when they destroy a German Dornier 17 bomber. CH3 is unimpressed that it takes six pilots to down a single, already crippled bomber, partly due to the poor gunnery skills of many of the pilots. Journalist Jackie Bellamy is keen to portray the war as a glorious adventure against an evil foe and cannot understand CH3's cynicism. Two of the pilots, 'Flash' Gordon and 'Fitz' Fitzgerald, begin respective romances with two local schoolteachers, French woman Nicole and expat Englishwoman Mary. Both couples eventually marry, although Fitzgerald experiences problems with sexual impotency. Fed up with Cattermole's bullying, Stickwell flies an unauthorised sortie, strafing a Luftwaffe airfield, but his aircraft is damaged and he crash-lands in Belgium. The squadron rescue him but Rex cannot forgive the incident and Stickwell is transferred to another unit. CH3 is increasingly at odds with the other pilots over his refusal to adhere to RAF tactics. The German Invasion of France and Belgium (Blitzkrieg) begins on 10 May 1940. Hornet Squadron's tactics are soon proved dangerously inadequate, especially to the pilots flying at the rear. In the first days, three inexperienced pilots are killed without the rest of the squadron even seeing the German Me-109 fighters that shoot them down. Whilst escorting a bomber attack against German ground forces, 'Moke' Miller is badly wounded and later dies in hospital. The remaining pilots at first doubt and then despise the outmoded tactics but Rex refuses to alter them. A bombing raid leaves Rex badly injured by shrapnel but he conceals his wounds from the other pilots and strong painkillers leave him euphoric and overconfident. Recklessly ordering Hornet Squadron to attack a much larger German formation, Rex dives down to his death but another pilot orders the others not to follow, several of the pilots deliberately crowding Barton's plane, preventing him from following Rex. Now acting Squadron Leader, Barton tries to rally his demoralised men, including a terrified Patterson and a cynical CH3. But the German advance is sweeping across France and Hornet Squadron has been reduced to a mere handful of Hurricanes still intact. Fleeing as a refugee, Nicole gets a lift with a motorcyclist but is killed in an accidental crash. Mary manages to reach England as do the survivors of Hornet Squadron. In August, Hornet Squadron is reformed and made operational again just as the Battle of Britain enters its most intense phase. Of the original pilots, only eight remain: Barton, CH3, Cattermole, Patterson, Fitzgerald, Gordon, 'Mother' Cox and Irishman 'Flip' Moran. Amongst the replacements are Czech pilot 'Haddy' Haducek, Pole 'Zab' Zabarnowski, mild-mannered Englishman Steele-Stebbing, cocky 'Bing' MacFarlane and young 'Nim' Renouf. They are soon seeing heavy action as the German Luftwaffe switches from attacking Channel convoys and begins an offensive against RAF airfields in southeast England. Hornet Squadron is using better tactics: shooting at closer range, flying in pairs, constantly checking the sky above and behind whilst in the air. Gordon has become eccentric and reckless after his wife's death. Cattermole finds a new victim for his bullying in Steele-Stebbing. Cattermole orders a reluctant Renouf to destroy an unarmed German Heinkel-59 rescue plane over the Channel. Moran, now a flight commander, is reluctant to accept Barton's authority. Intelligence Officer 'Skull' Skelton is sceptical about the numbers of German aircraft that Fighter Command is claiming to shoot down, as is Jackie Bellamy who has become cynical about the conduct of the war. The inadequate training of new pilots and the poor gunnery skills are soon painfully obvious. Skelton becomes very unpopular when he refuses to confirm all of the pilot's victory claims. The battle continues to intensify and all of the pilots begin to suffer exhaustion and nervous strain. Moran is horribly burnt to death when he is shot down. 'Bing' MacFarlane destroys two German planes and performs a forbidden 'Victory Roll' which causes him to fatally crash. Cattermole meets up with Stickwell, finding out the latter is now a pilot in a two-seater Defiant squadron. Stickwell flies into action as a gunner and is killed. On the same day, Fitzgerald, his aircraft damaged, gets lost in dense fog and vanishes at sea. His wife Mary, now pregnant, refuses to accept that her husband is dead and is soon seen hanging around the aerodrome perimeter, which the other pilots find disturbing. Gordon's eccentricity grows more acute and infuriates the more seriously minded CH3. Zabarnowski is killed in action and several new pilots are also lost, sometimes not even lasting a single day. Cattermole bails out from a defective Hurricane and his unmanned aircraft crashes into a town and kills four civilians. Skelton is appalled at Cattermole's refusal to show any remorse. Steele-Stebbing retaliates against Cattermole with a practical joke and the two appear to declare an unofficial truce. Cattermole angrily forces Mary to cease her vigil and leave the aerodrome. It is now September 1940 and the Battle of Britain is reaching its height. The survivors of Hornet squadron are exhausted and at breaking point. Haducek is killed and Renouf is badly burned. Gordon is badly wounded and later dies, news of his death hitting a battle-fatigued CH3 particularly hard. Jackie Bellamy discusses with the pilots the possibility of a German Invasion of Britain and she concludes, aided by the expert knowledge and input from a Royal Navy fighter pilot drafted into the squadron that the Germans lack the naval capacity to do so. On 7 September, the Luftwaffe launches a massed attack against London and every available RAF fighter unit is flung into action, including Hornet Squadron. Steele-Stebbing and Cattermole are both killed. Cox bails out and Patterson force-lands but both remain alive. The story ends with Barton and CH3 diving yet again to attack the massed ranks of German bombers. Reception In an interview in 2009, the novel's author Derek Robinson remarked that when the novel was first published in the UK in 1983, it sold very poorly although sales were better in the US. It was not until the release of the LWT mini-series based on the novel in 1988 that sales of the book greatly improved. Angus Calder wrote about the novel in 1991, saying that > The ex-public school types in Hornet Squadron are variously oafish, stupid, > callow, neurotically disturbed or (in one case) positively evil...Cattermole > is a relentless practical joker, liar, bully and thief with homicidal > propensities which make him (Robinson's text insinuates) just the right type > to be a fighter pilot...After destroying most of his pilots in horrible > ways, minutely described, with uncannily precise technical know-how, > Robinson, resisting closure, is bound to suggest a kind of 'point' by his > selection of those who are still alive in the last pages. [Robinson can] > demonstrate his virtuosity by making somehow tolerable page after page of > silly RAF backchat linked with pointless and sometimes cruel horseplay; he > can emphasise stresses and fatigues which destroy men's judgement and set us > up to mock the crumbling organisation of Fighter Command. But he cannot end > with the Luftwaffe winning: because it didn't. (The pilots) might not be > chivalric young Englishmen but they are still in the air fighting at the > end, as indeed their whole groggy Command was. Robinson's book is very > exciting and often, in gallows-humour mode, very funny. However he cannot > counteract his reader's knowledge of the Big Fact (the Allied victory), > which at times makes his approach to the battle seem wilfully > cynical.Calder, Angus. The Myth of the Blitz. Pimlico 1992. p162-163. A 1984 book review by Kirkus Reviews concluded; \\"Robinson fails to develop enough character-texture in his large, oddly faceless cast-of- characters‚Äîgiving an overlong novel only chronology as a shaping force. With stern, shrewd editing, then, this might have been the most powerful of RAF novels. As it is, it's superb in the first third, sporadically hilarious, always strongly narrated, but increasingly routine (and repetitious) in its preachier second half: a bulky mixed bag for the WW Il-aviation audience.\\" Quotes *\\"They're all a bit mad, you know. They wouldn't do it unless there was a damn good chance of getting killed, wouldn't they? So they can't be completely normal. They're not what you'd call model citizens, any of them. More like Vandals, I suppose. They're just itching to be turned loose with an eight-gun Hurricane on some lumbering great bomber. I mean that's your average fighter pilot's attitude, isn't it? Show him something, anything really, and deep down inside, his first reaction is: What sort of a mess could I make of that with a couple of three-second bursts? Herd of cows, doubledecker bus, garden party--makes no difference what it is, that's the thought in the back of his mind. Not surprising, really. I've often thought it's a damn good job they're in the RAF, otherwise they'd all be out there blowing up banks.\\" *\\"The whole purpose of the armed forces can be summed up in one word ‚Äì killing. Now, I don‚Äôt find that goal ‚Äì in your words ‚Äì marvelous, or magnificent, and try as I might I cannot bring myself to feel proud of it. Grateful, perhaps, as one is selfishly grateful for the existence of men who keep the sewage system working. But proud? No.\\" *\\"One tries to be open minded. If anyone can show me the glamour in a man‚Äôs head getting blown off, I shall do my best to see it.\\" *\\"You know‚Ä¶ leadership is a confidence trick. You have to persuade men that you can do absolutely anything, otherwise they lose confidence in you and instead of following eagerly into the jaws of death they begin wondering whether perhaps they should go to the lavatory instead.\\" *\\"My idea of an honourable solution is winning. I want every possible advantage I can get ‚Äì fair, unfair or downright deplorable. I‚Äôve never yet met an enemy pilot who was willing to compromise, and neither am I.\\" *\\"Five minutes was enough to tell Moran that Haducek was an excellent fighter pilot‚Ä¶ He could do all the usual things with a Hurricane and several very unusual things, plus a couple of things that Moran had no wish to copy in case the wings came off.\\" *\\"It was perfectly obvious that if I sat in that kite it was bound to crash and I would probably get killed. Anyone with an ounce of gallantry would have stayed at the controls and tried to miss the innocent bystanders. I haven‚Äôt got an ounce of gallantry. I don‚Äôt intend to kill myself to save three and a half civilians. It‚Äôs their war as well as mine, so they can jolly well take some of the risk.\\" *\\"You make it sound as if all we have to do to win is not lose. It‚Äôs not that easy! You don‚Äôt win wars just by not losing. People need a victory, they need to prove themselves‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got to beat the Luftwaffe just to show it can be done.\\" Historical links *In the novel, the character of Moggy Cattermole is pursuing a mortally damaged German bomber and he notices that one of the Luftwaffe crewmen has become hopelessly stuck in the escape hatch beneath the aircraft, his legs dangling in mid-air. Cattermole shoots him dead. A similar real-life incident occurred in December 1941 when Wing- Commander Robert Stanford Tuck, then leading the Biggin Hill Fighter Wing, with the aid of another pilot, shot down a Junkers Ju 88 over the Channel. A solitary survivor was sighted floating in the water, without a dinghy and many miles from the Dutch coast and with no ships in sight to rescue him. Tuck, wishing to spare the German airman a slow, painful death from exposure, strafed the water and killed him. Tuck later wrote, \\"If that were me, down there.....this is what I would want to happen. It was the right thing, the only thing to do. But I will tell no one, for some may not understand.\\"Forrester, Larry. Fly For Your Life. Panther Books Ltd 1973. p175-177. *When the character of 'Flip' Moran is shot down, he dies horribly, trapped in a flaming cockpit. When his relatives arrive to collect the coffin with his remains, they request to see the body. Adjutant Kellaway has to uncomfortably explain that it would be inappropriate due to the circumstances of his death. The incident was mirrored in the actual experiences of Wing- Commander H R 'Dizzy' Allen who flew Spitfires with No 66 Squadron during the Battle of Britain. In September 1940, one of his comrades was killed when his fighter crashed in a full-speed, vertical dive. Little of the body was recovered and the coffin's interior was lined with sandbags to give it some weight. He wrote, \\"...his parents arrived, having received the fatality signal, and requested that they be allowed to a last look at their son. Fortunately, the officer in charge of the funeral tactfully pointed out that...it would be a rather unpleasant experience for them to see it in that condition. All they would have seen, in fact, was a jampot surrounded by sandbags\\".Allen, Wing Commander H.R. 'Dizzy'. Battle for Britain. Corgi Books 1975. p57 Miscellaneous information *In the final pages of the book there is a group discussion about Hitler‚Äôs prospects for a successful invasion of Great Britain. After examining the problems of attempting a covert crossing of the English Channel they are led to the conclusion that it is impossible because of the Royal Navy. However, the character Hart insists that the Battle of Britain is nonetheless crucial, because to win the war the RAF must not just avoid losing: it must show that the Luftwaffe can be beaten. *The book was followed by a sequel, A Good Clean Fight, following the exploits of a number of the surviving characters of Piece of Cake in North Africa. *The very first publication by Roald Dahl (author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, etc) was a 1942 article that he had titled \\"A Piece of Cake\\" (although the title was changed in publication). Dahl was an ace RAF fighter pilot and the story was about his flying experiences in the war. The article was later rewritten as a short story, also called \\"A Piece of Cake,\\" which was included in the collection Over to You.

Western Christians were aware of it but did not use it. It was named for the Roman Emperor Diocletian who instigated the last major persecution against Christians in the Empire. Diocletian began his reign 20 November 284 during the Alexandrian year that began on 1 Thoth, the Egyptian New Year, or 29 August 284, so that date was used as the epoch: year one of the Diocletian era began on that date. This era was used to number the year in Easter tables produced by the Church of Alexandria. When Dionysius Exiguus continued those tables for an additional 95 years, he replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his anno Domini era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times. The anno Diocletiani era was not the only one used by early Christians. Most Roman Christians, like the pagan Romans before them, designated their years by naming the two consuls who held office that year. The Romans also used the ab urbe condita (AUC) era. Its name is Latin for \\"from the founding of the City (Rome)\\". However, the AUC era was hardly ever used outside historical treatises. Eras that began at Creation, called anno Mundi eras, became the dominant method of numbering years in the East until modern times, such as in the Byzantine calendar. Annianus of Alexandria, a monk who flourished at the beginning of the 5th century, placed the epoch of his world era on 25 March 5492BC by counting back eleven 532-year paschal cycles from anno Diocletiani 77, itself four 19-year lunar cycles after anno Diocletiani 1. Regarded as a civil rather than a religious era, it began on the first day of the Alexandrian year, 29 August 5493BC. This Alexandrian era was the preferred era used by Byzantine Christians such as Maximus the Confessor until the Byzantine era, having an epoch of 1 September 5509BC, became dominant in the 10th century. Both eras used a version of dating Creation based on the Septuagint.

He chiefly writes on the private life of film stars and singers. Life Born in Paris, France, in 1954, David Bret was adopted by an English couple and raised in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire. He worked for several years in the retail trade, then as an administrator with the NHS, and as a singer in working men's clubs. He then began writing the biographies for which he is best known. He married Jeanne Elliss in October 1972, and has a son, Marleau, born in October 1973. He lives in West Yorkshire, England. Biographies Bret has written a number of biographies for several different publishers. Many of these have focused on the private or intimate lives of entertainment celebrities. Lewis Jones, in the Telegraph wrote that Bret \\"...for decades has churned out sensationalist biographies of such figures as Diana Dors, Barbra Streisand and Tallulah Bankhead.\\" Clark Gable In Clark Gable: Tormented Star Bret deals at length with Gable's sex life and particularly his sex with other men. In the New York Times Sunday Book Review, Ada Calhoun wrote \\"How does Bret, the author of numerous celebrity biographies, know so much about Hollywood stars‚Äô sex lives? Judging by this new book's convoluted wording, he really doesn't.\\" She also wrote: \\"For all its smut, the book is painfully unsexy. ... And yet Bret undermines his own arguments. ... 'Clark Gable' teems with innuendo and exclamation points, but still presents a thoroughly joyless view of old Hollywood.\\" George Formby In George Formby: A Troubled Genius Bret explores the \\" innocent innuendo\\" of a once hugely popular music-hall performer. Jonathan Glancey writing for The Guardian described it as \\"David Bret's thoughtful book about the life and unhappiness of an entertainer who would surely never make it anywhere near the top now.\\" Greta Garbo Greta Garbo: Divine Star was criticized by Lewis Jones, who wrote: \\"There is little new to say about Garbo‚Äôs life, and the best one can expect of a retelling is insight, wit and a shapely narrative, none of which is provided by Divine Star.\\" Lewis complains that: > Bret makes many errors. Of Garbo‚Äôs visit to New York in 1925, for example, > he notes that she met Humphrey Bogart, one of \\"the biggest stars of the > day\\", when he made his name with The Petrified Forest in 1936. He thinks > that the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise is a drama school. And so on. He also writes > incredibly badly, ...\\" Christopher Fowler was more positive about Divine Star In The Independent he wrote: > Garbo biographies are virtually an industry in themselves. But David Bret is > after something more. Digging into previously unsourced material and > collating fresh stories from friends and fellow studio employees, he tries > to close the two major gaps in his subject's life. Fowler concludes by saying: \\"Bret's biography is rightly partisan and fully prepared to name enemies, which makes it a bracingly pleasurable read in these anodyne times.\\" Joan Crawford Writing in The Washington Post, Carolyn See has a very negative view of Brent's biography of Joan Crawford, calling it \\"... one of the ickiest film biographies I've ever read.\\" See writes: > \\"But suppose you gorged on old movie magazines and ghostwritten gobbledygook > and pieces of weird gossip you overheard and then decided to rewrite what > has been written and rewritten again for 80 years or so, and you picked as > your subject Joan Crawford, \\"gay icon par excellence\\"?

See concludes that \\"Ultimately, it's an enormous insult to gays, assuming, as it does, that mindless cattiness and restroom innuendo are the accepted small talk of homosexuals everywhere.\\" An unsigned review in Publishers Weekly is more neutral, writing: \\"Bret chronicles her films, her feud with Bette Davis and dismisses her daughter's Mommie Dearest tirade, but he revels in Hollywood's sexual excesses, and fans who crave a lively insider view will most appreciate this bio.\\" Maria Callas An unsigned review in Publishers Weekly says of Maria Callas: The Tigress and the Lamb that > Bret, clearly a Callas aficionado, glosses over the controversial aspects of > the voice and emphasizes her total commitment to her art, her brilliant > resurrection of nearly forgotten bel canto roles and her extraordinary > dramatic skills. He also recounts all the sensational details of Callas's > life .... The emphasis is on scandal rather than music in this racy > biography...\\" Errol Flynn An unsigned, undated review in Publishers Weekly says of Errol Flynn: Satan's Angel that \\"Bret, however, takes on the Flynn mythology in this new biography.\\" The review goes on to say that: > With the same gusto and verve of his subject, Bret plows through Flynn's > escapades and accomplishments.

Edith Piaf An unsigned, undated review in Publishers Weekly says of The Piaf Legend that \\"Bret presents little new information-and is no more successful than his predecessors in uncovering the reasons for Piaf's enormous appeal.\\" Maurice Chevalier An unsigned, undated review in Publishers Weekly says of Maurice Chevalier: Up on Top of a Rainbow \\"In this entertaining look at the life of Maurice Chevalier (l888-l972), Bret, author of The Piaf Legend and The Mistinquett Legend , again shows his prowess as a chronicler of French stars.\\" The review goes on to say: \\" Bret supports his biography with authoritative sources, although on occasion his facts are askew, as when he makes a reference to 'John F. Kennedy and his mother, Ethel.'\\" Morrissey An unsigned, undated review in Publishers Weekly says of Morrissey: Scandal & Passion: > Thankfully, author Bret's profile is not the sensationalist expose one might > expect given this volume's titillating subtitle. ...

It is one of the Clee Hills, and is in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Geography Brown Clee Hill lies five miles north of its sister and neighbour, Titterstone Clee Hill. The highest peak of the hill is Abdon Burf, at 540 metres high with Clee Burf at 510m. Much more of Brown Clee Hill is private land than on Titterstone Clee, and large areas are covered with coniferous plantations. The eastern expanse of the hill is in possession of the Burwarton Estate under ownership of Viscount Boyne, whilst the western fringes of the hill are owned by various private land owners and the parish of Clee St. Margaret. The common land features the remains of where an Iron Age hill fort once stood (See Below). Nearby towns are Ludlow, Cleobury Mortimer, Church Stretton, Broseley, Bridgnorth and Much Wenlock. Location Map of Brown Clee Several air traffic control radar masts on the summit of the hill can be seen for many miles around. They, along with the ones on top of Titterstone Clee Hill build up a picture of all the aircraft in a hundred-mile radius. A toposcope (recently built) points out local landmarks and is sited at the summit. Geology Like Titterstone Clee to the south, Brown Clee is formed from sedimentary rocks originating during the Carboniferous period, rising above the lower ground which is underlain by older strata of Devonian, and having a capping of hardwearing igneous rock. The gentler relief of the surrounding area is characterised by the mudstones and sandstones of the St Maughans Formation. The lower slopes of the hill itself are formed by the sandstones and conglomerates of the overlying Clee Sandstone Formation, the boundary between the two sets of strata being marked by the narrow outcrop of the Upper Abdon Limestone. Together these constitute the Lower Old Red Sandstone of the area; the middle and upper 'Old Red' are absent locally. This sequence of rocks is unconformably overlain by the mudstones of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures which of course include coal seams. Atop this thickness of sedimentary rocks are the outcrops of dolerite which form the summits of both Abdon Burf and Clee Burf. A dark coloured rock, it is known locally as 'dhustone', dhu perhaps deriving from Welsh 'du' meaning 'black'. This erosion-resistant rock was intruded into the sedimentary rocks in late Carboniferous times, though all overlying strata have long since eroded away. Extensive areas of head are mapped to the east, and to an extent to the north, of the hill. History Several Iron Age hill forts are dotted around the Clee Hills. Nordy Bank is the last 'intact' survivor of three hill forts on Brown Clee. The other two, at Abdon Burf and Clee Burf, have been largely lost to quarrying activity. Nordy Bank occupies a sloping ridge top site and its ramparts are up to three metres high. It was built some time in the British Iron Age first millennium BC and gives a commanding view of the local countryside. Quarrying was for long the main income of the area, and it was widely known as a dangerous and gruelling job. People would walk to the Abdon Quarry on Brown Clee Hill from as far as Bridgnorth and Ludlow, and often they would tend to at least one other job. They were quarrying for Dhustone (Dolerite), a very hard and challenging material to extract. The Abdon Clee quarries closed in 1936, and by this time the area had become almost industrial, with a concrete plant, tarmac plant in Ditton Priors, plus a small railway to move the stone - and the quarries themselves. If the wind was coming down over the hill it was apparently possible to hear the stone crusher at the top crunching away, even down in Cleehill village. After the quarries closed, a lot of the quarrymen went to work at the Cockshutford quarries on the other side of Brown Clee but the dhustone there was not as good quality and durable as over on the Abdon side and that quarry failed too after a short period. Many of the men returned and worked at the naval ammunition depot set up at Ditton Priors at the start of the war. The quarries totally finished in the 1930s and 40s. Whilst the radar facilities of the Clee Hills protect aircraft, both hills were once a hazard to aircraft, and a memorial, unveiled on Good Friday in 1981, commemorates the 23 Allied and German airmen killed here when their planes crashed into Brown Clee during World War II, in addition to those of a Jet Provost which crashed on the hill in 1969. The first aircraft to crash into Brown Clee was a German Junkers 88, on 1 April 1941. Two Wellington Bombers, a Hawker Typhoon and at least two Avro Ansons also crashed here. It is now thought that there were more wartime crashes on Brown Clee than any other hill in Britain. The engine and other parts of one of the Wellington Bombers are said to rest on the bottom of Boyne Water, Brown Clee.

Biography Born in Rome to a little-known painter, Pietro Fetti, Domenico is said to have apprenticed initially under Ludovico Cigoli, or his pupil Andrea Commodi in Rome from circa 1604‚Äì1613. He then worked in Mantua from 1613 to 1622, patronized by the Cardinal, later Duke Ferdinando I Gonzaga. In the Ducal Palace, he painted the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes. The series of representations of New Testament parables he carried out for his patron's studiolo gave rise to a popular specialty,Pamela Askew, \\"The Parable Paintings of Domenico Fetti.\\" Art Bulletin 43 (1961:31‚Äì32], reprinted in Seventeenth Century Art in Italy, France and Spain (The Garland Library of the History of Art 8).

In August or September 1622,Askew 1978. his feuds with some prominent Mantuans led him to move to Venice, which for the first few decades of the seventeenth century had persisted in sponsoring Mannerist styles (epitomized by Palma the Younger and the successors of Tintoretto and Veronese). Into this mix, in the 1620s‚Äì30s, three \\"foreigners\\"‚ÄîFetti and his younger contemporaries Bernardo Strozzi and Jan Lys‚Äîbreathed the first influences of Roman Baroque style. They adapted some of the rich coloration of Venice but adapted it to Caravaggio- influenced realism and monumentality.See Alfred Moir, The Italian Followers of Caravaggio. 2 vols. (Harvard University Press) 1967. In Venice, where he remained despite pleas from the Duke to return to Mantua, Fetti changed his style: his formalized painting style became more colorful. In addition, he devoted attention to smaller cabinet pieces that adapt genre imaging to religious stories. His group of paintings entitled Parables, which represent New Testament scenes, are at the Dresden Gem√§ldegalerie. He influenced Leonaert Bramer. His painting style appears to have been influenced by Rubens. He would likely have continued to find excellent patronage in Venice had he not died there in 1623 or 1624. Jan Lys, eight years younger, but who had arrived in Venice nearly contemporaneously, died during the plague of 1629‚Äì30. Subsequently, Fetti's style would influence the Venetians Pietro della Vecchia and Sebastiano Mazzone. His pupils in Mantua were Francesco Bernardi (il Bigolaro) and Dionisio Guerri.Le vite de' pittori, degli scultori, et architetti veronesi, by Bartolomeo Dal Pozzo (1718), page 169.

The book is considered the first book written about leys, and the first book to document and map alleged ley lines in Britain, primarily southern England. According to a review in The Geographical Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Watkins sought to prove that \\"mounds, moats, beacons and markstones fall into strait tracks, i.e. sighted lines, throughout Britain, with fragmentary evidence of trackways on the alignments.\\" The book was disregarded by archaeologists but saw a resurgence of interest with the rise of New Age ideas in the 1960s. Watkins' ideas also influenced contemporary psychogeography, including Iain Sinclair's Lud Heat (1975), which in turn influenced Peter Ackroyd's novel Hawksmoor (1985). Criticism Watkins' work met with early scepticism from archaeologists, one of whom, O. G. S. Crawford, refused to accept advertisements for The Old Straight Track in the journal Antiquity. One criticism of Watkins' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in Britain and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that \\"connect\\" sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence. A statistical analysis of lines concluded: \\"the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites.\\" Reprints The book was reprinted as on April 2, 1994 by \\"Abacus\\". Editions or reprints were published in 1925, 1933, 1945, 1948, 1970, 1974 and 1994.

The city is located in the Southwestern region of Minas Gerais and the micro-region of Passos. It became a municipality in 1938.IBGE Name and History Founded as the village of S√£o Sebasti√£o da Ventania, it had its name later shortened to Ventania. In 1914, the name was officially changed to the current one: Alpinopolis. Curiously, after so many years, Ventania still is the name used by its inhabitants. Alpinopolis seen from the Monte das Oliveiras Park- Partial View - Photo: Felix Tansil Location The city center of Alpin√≥polis is located at an elevation of 700 meters southeast of Passos and west of the Furnas reservoir. Neighboring municipalities are: S√£o Jos√© da Barra (N), Carmo do Rio Claro (E), Nova Resende and Bom Jesus da Penha (S), and Passos (W).

While coffee and milk were the main products for many years nowadays one of the main products of the local economy is the extraction and commercialization of quartz. Small and medium-sized properties predominate in the municipality, which contribute for a better distribution of income. In 2005 there were 48 extractive industries employing 361 workers, 77 transformation industries employing 251 workers, and 360 retail units employing 768 workers. The GDP in 2005 was approximately R$129 million, with 62 million reais from services, 18 million reais from industry, and 41 million reais from agriculture. There were 861 rural producers on 29,000 hectares of land. 212 farms had tractors (2006). Approximately 6000 persons were occupied in agriculture. The main crops are rice, beans, and corn. There were 20,000 head of cattle, of which 10,000 were milk cows (2006). There were 3 banks (2010). In the vehicle fleet there were 3,641 automobiles, 358 trucks, 298 pickup trucks, 23 buses, and 882 motorcycles (2007). Health and education In the health sector there were 15 health establishments: 9 public and 6 private. There were 4 general health clinics and 5 specialized. There was one hospital with 30 beds (2005). Patients with more serious health conditions are transported to neighboring cities, such as Passos or Ribeirao Preto. Educational needs of their approximately 4,000 students were met by 12 primary schools, 4 middle schools, and 11 pre-primary schools. Culture View of Monte das Oliveiras stage, where every year The Passion of Christ is reenacted during Holy Week. Serra da Ventania - Ventania Hills - on the background - Picture by Felix Tansil Congadas & Mo√ßambique Every year end in Alpinopolis is marked by the Congadas or Congo and Mo√ßambique celebration. This cheerful celebration consists of dancers and drum players walking around the city streets, wearing colorful satin costumes. The groups (ternos) use two main colors in their costumes and is led by a captain, who guides them through the streets of Alpinopolis, where they are joined by groups of curious people. Each day of the celebration ends up in one of the several churches of the city, where all groups join to attend a mass and resume the day activities. It is not clear how this century-old celebration began, but it seems to be a derivation of an African tradition, as the names Congo and Mozambique suggest. It originally started as a religious related celebration, and over time, it became more of a colorful parade. Originally, the celebration would start months earlier, when religious people -here called reis (kings) or rainhas (queens)- would promise walking around town and attending a mass as thanksgiving for some miracle or grace received that year. Offering a meal (usually dinner) was also part of the thanksgiving ritual. Each group would be entitled to pick up a few people every day and guide them through the streets to the church, where the daily mass would be celebrated. After that, the group would attend the \\"thanksgiving dinner\\" offered by those people they guided earlier. Nowadays, religiosity seems to have become less of the core of the celebration, and it became more of a colorful parade, where men of all ages spend time drinking, dancing and having fun. Monte das Oliveiras Idealized by Jos√© Iglair Lopes, the Monte das Oliveiras is an ecumenical \\"biblical park\\", built for reflection about the bible in different moments. From the main entrance, where a monument representing the Ten Commandments tablets stand, the visitors are guided through a series of small monuments representing important moments in Christ's life or crucial parts of the Old Testament. It is currently considered one if the most beautiful and most important tourist attraction in Minas Gerais, especially during the Holy Week, when it becomes an outdoor stage for reenactment of the passion of Christ.

According to latest data from IBGE (2009), its population is estimated to be 13,810. The inhabitants of the city usually travel to the nearest city, Alfenas, when they are in need of more sophisticated supplies. Alterosa was founded on 17 December 1938. History It is said that Alterosa was one of the first populated places in the South of Minas Gerais. By the year of 1700, the residents took notice of the small river that became known as Ribeir√£o S√£o Joaquim. Jos√© Rodrigues Moreira, a Portuguese man coming from Esp√≠rito Santo, marked the development of the city. In that occasion, the people living there called the city S√£o Joaquim da Serra Negra, due to the existence of a hill in the surroundings. On 28 June 1850, a very influent Baron (Bar√£o Silva) turned Alterosa to a municipality, after the building of a Parish. The name Alterosa means \\"High Majesty\\".

In 1995, Jones released a recording of his composition Meltdown, on the CD of that name, in honor of his happenstance visit to Three Mile Island, on the night of March 28, 1979. He earned Summa Cum Laude degrees in mathematics, American studies and a Doctorate in Law from the University of Maine System. As noted by Chancellor J. Michael Orenduff in his 1995 State of Education address to the Maine House and Senate, Jones is the only student in the history of the University of Maine System to complete an entire mathematics degree in just two semesters. Political career First elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1994, Jones became Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Utilities and Energy in 1996. In this position, he drafted and sponsored Maine's Electric Deregulation Act, chairing all hearings and workshops. The act passed unanimously, and the resulting influx of cheap electricity and loss of monopoly status led to the closure of Maine Yankee Nuclear Plant in 1997. The act also mandates a 30% renewable resource portfolio for all companies selling electricity in Maine. He was named the 1997 Public Official of the Year in Maine. After serving for four years in the Maine House of Representatives, Jones chose not to run for office a third time. Jones currently works as the senior archivist for composer Carman Moore.

It forms the biggest and base hospital of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), which is affiliated with McGill University. The hospital was established in 1893 and was based at Pine Avenue, now known as the Legacy site, until 2015, when major hospital operations were moved to the Glen site (1001 D√©carie Boulevard), named for the former Glen railway yards.

Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal. 1939. The Royal Victoria Hospital was established in 1893 in the historic Golden Square Mile through donations by two public-spirited Scottish immigrants, the cousins Donald Smith, 1st Lord Strathcona, and George Stephen, 1st Lord Mount Stephen. In 1887, they announced a joint gift of C$1,000,000 for the construction of a free hospital in Montreal and purchased a site on Mount Royal for a further C$86,000. The site they bought was the old Frothingham estate that covered ten acres of land.Montreal Gazette March 5, 2013: Whats next for the Royal Victoria Hospital? Who decides? During 1897 and 1898, Smith and Stephen gave another C$1,000,000 between them in Great Northern Railroad securities to establish an endowment fund to maintain the hospital. Stephen and Smith attached one caveat to their generous contribution to the City of Montreal: the hospital's land and its buildings must only ever be used for healing.Elspeth Angus interviewed by the Montreal Gazette The founders intended the Royal Vic \\"to be for the use of the sick and ailing without distinction of race or creed,\\" and when it opened in 1893 it was hailed as the \\"finest and most perfectly equipped (hospital) on the great American continent\\".The Royal Victoria Hospital Site The hospital originally had 150 employees, including 14 medical doctors. Over the years, the philanthropy and business acumen of many of the residents of the Golden Square Mile - the prominent members of Montreal's English speaking community - brought the hospital global recognition as a major centre of healthcare and learning. Major contributors included James Ross, Richard Angus, Sir Vincent Meredith and Sir Montagu Allan. In 1920, the hospital became a medical research institute through the McGill University Faculty of Medicine. In 1929, Dr. Wilder Penfield established the Montreal Neurological Institute adjacent to the hospital. Among the list of medical achievements at the Royal Victoria was the first successful kidney transplant in the Commonwealth in 1958. It was achieved by a team led by nephrologist John Dossetor and surgeons Joe Luke and Ken MacKinnon. Today, the Royal Victoria Hospital is part of the McGill University Health Centre. Amid the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the hospital is currently being used as an isolation unit for homeless people who have been infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as those awaiting test results.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada, 1997 Royal Vic entrance from Pine Avenue The hospital was previously housed in a building complex at 687 Pine Avenue on the slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Ville-Marie. Hospital operations moved to the new Glen site of the McGill University Health Centre on April 26, 2015, except for the McGill Reproductive Centre and the Dialysis Clinic, which remained at the original site as of 2015. Of its nine pavilions, three date from the original 1893 hospital and were designed by Henry Saxon Snell in the Scottish baronial style. The nearby Allan Memorial Institute continues to house the psychiatry department. The post-2015 future of the 122-year-old Royal Vic building is yet to be determined. McGill University has unveiled an idea to repurpose the hospital for academic purposes, but also add community and green space.Royal Victoria Hospital The original hospital was designed by the Scottish architect Henry Saxon Snell, who from the 1860s had made a name for himself in England and Scotland as a leading specialist in the design of hospitals, particularly in London. Constructed of Montreal limestone, the original Royal Vic is distinguished by its crenelated structures and romantic turrets framing generous sun porches at the corners of its imposing medical and surgical wards. Snell's aesthetic plans for the Royal Vic were inspired by the Scottish baronial style of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. From a medical perspective, his design of the Royal Vic was influenced by the ideas of Florence Nightingale as a Pavilion Hospital, in which the separation and isolation of both patients and diseases were thought to discourage the spread of infection.Restoring Women's History Through Historic Preservation. By Gail Lee Dubrow & Jennifer B. Goodman (2003) The original part of the building was completed in 1893. The hospital was later enlarged by the addition of new wings of the same architectural style. The H pavilion opened in 1905 as the nurses' residence). The 1920s saw the addition of the Women's and Ross Memorial pavilions. Another expansion was completed in the early 1950s giving the hospital its M and S pavilions; a portion of the original hospital was demolished to accomplish this. Lastly the C pavilion, housing the emergency room, birthing centre, and a large modern ICU opened in 1993. A time capsule is located in the wall facing the C pavilion's elevators on the ground floor. Hersey Pavilion The Hersey Pavilion, also known as the H Pavilion, was one of the first purpose-built nurses' residences in Canada. It is located on the hospital campus, and was constructed in 1905. It was designed by the well-known Montreal architects Edward & William Sutherland Maxwell. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 in recognition of the important role the building played in the training and professionalism of nurses in Canada.

It is somewhat analogous to the laterality of right- or left-handedness; however, the side of the dominant eye and the dominant hand do not always match. This is because both hemispheres control both eyes, but each one takes charge of a different half of the field of vision, and therefore a different half of both retinas (See Optic Tract for more details). There is thus no direct analogy between \\"handedness\\" and \\"eyedness\\" as lateral phenomena. Approximately 70% of the population are right-eye dominant and 29% left-eye dominant. Dominance does appear to change depending upon direction of gaze due to image size changes on the retinas. There also appears to be a higher prevalence of left-eye dominance in those with Williams‚ÄìBeuren syndrome, and possibly in migraine sufferers as well. Eye dominance has been categorized as \\"weak\\" or \\"strong\\"; highly profound cases are sometimes caused by amblyopia or strabismus. In those with anisometropic myopia (different amounts of nearsightedness between the two eyes), the dominant eye has typically been found to be the one with more myopia. As far as regards subjects with normal binocular vision, the widespread notion that the individual's better-sighted eye would tend to be the dominant eye has been challenged as lacking empirical basis. Dominance can change and may switch between the eyes depending on the task and physical condition of the subject (i.e. fatigue). Effects In normal binocular vision there is an effect of parallax, and therefore the dominant eye is the one that is primarily relied on for precise positional information. This may be extremely important in sports which require aim, such as archery, darts or shooting sports. It has been asserted that cross-dominance (in which the dominant eye is on one side and the dominant hand is on the other) is advantageous in sports requiring side-on stances (e.g. baseball, cricket, golf); however, studies within the last 20 years have shown this not to be the case. In a 1998 study of professional baseball players, hand‚Äìocular dominance patterns did not show an effect on batting average or ERA. Similarly, in 2005, a South African study found that \\"cricketers were not more likely to have crossed dominance\\" than the normal population. Ocular dominance is an important consideration in predicting patient satisfaction with monovision correction in cataract surgery refractive surgery, also laser eye surgery, and contact lens wear. The dominant eye has more neural connections to the brain than the other eye does. According to a sixty-person study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, in non-dyslexic people, the blue cone-free spot in the dominant eye tends to be round and the same spot in the non-dominant eye tends to be unevenly shaped; in dyslexic people both eyes tend to have round areas. The study suggests this difference may be a potential, and possibly treatable, cause of dyslexia; however, further tests are required to confirm. At least 700 million people worldwide have dyslexia. In response to the study, John Stein of the University of Oxford cautions that while the study is \\"really interesting\\", there is no one single cause of dyslexia. Determination A person's dominant eye \\"is determined by subjective alignment of two objects presented at a stereodisparity far beyond Panum's area\\". There are a number of ways to do this: #The Miles test. The observer extends both arms, brings both hands together to create a small opening, then with both eyes open views a distant object through the opening. The observer then alternates closing the eyes or slowly draws opening back to the head to determine which eye is viewing the object (i.e. the dominant eye). #The Porta test. The observer extends one arm, then with both eyes open aligns the thumb or index finger with a distant object. The observer then alternates closing the eyes or slowly draws the thumb/finger back to the head to determine which eye is viewing the object (i.e. the dominant eye). #The Dolman method, also known as the hole-in- the-card test. The subject is given a card with a small hole in the middle, instructed to hold it with both hands, then instructed to view a distant object through the hole with both eyes open. The observer then alternates closing the eyes or slowly draws the opening back to the head to determine which eye is viewing the object (i.e. the dominant eye). #The convergence near-point test. The subject fixates an object that is moved toward the nose until divergence of one eye occurs (i.e. the non-dominant eye). It is an objective test of ocular dominance. #Certain stereograms. #The pinhole test. #The ring test. #Lens fogging technique. The subject fixates a distant object with both eyes open and appropriate correction in place. A +2.00 or +2.50 lens is alternately introduced in front of each eye, which blurs the distant object. The subject is then asked to state in which eye is the blur more noticeable. This is the dominant eye. #A dichoptic motion coherence threshold test yields a quantified indication of ocular dominance. Forced choice tests of dominance, such as the Dolman method, allow only a right or left eye result.

Justo, expressed the need for a greater social focus. The PS itself was founded in 1896, led by Justo and Nicol√°s Repetto, thus becoming the first mass party in the country. The party affiliated itself with the Second International.Rubio, Jos√© Luis. Las internacionales obreras en Am√©rica.

Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 286 Through its life, the party suffered from various splits: the International Socialist Party (which became the Communist Party of Argentina) and the Independent Socialist Party were the most notable. The most important of those was in the 1960s, when the party divided itself in half, giving birth to the more radical Argentine Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Argentino, PSA), and the more moderate Democratic Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Democr√°tico, PSD). In 1966, two factions departed the PSA: Vanguardia Comunista and Partido Socialista de Vanguardia. In 1972, the remaining of the PSA together with other leftist groups formed the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular, PSP). The PSP and PSD were rejoined in 2002, forming the Socialist Party. Badge of the original Socialist Party, still used today. Among the socialist leaders of Argentina, the most remarkable are Alfredo Palacios, who was the first socialist parliamentarian in the Americas (1904) and a Senator in the 1960s; Juan B.

The Socialist Party of Argentina maintains an electoral stronghold in the province of Santa Fe, and particularly in Rosario, where mayors have been socialists since 1989. Former two-term mayor Hermes Binner slowly became acknowledged as a reference character for the party. In the 2005 parliamentary elections a Socialist- Radical alliance led by Binner won 5 seats in the national Lower House, and in the elections of 2007 Binner, leading a broad, centre-leftist political coalition (the Progressive, Civic and Social Front), became the first Socialist to be elected governor of an Argentine province.La Capital, 3 September 2007. Un socialista en el sill√≥n de la Casa Gris . Present day In the 2011 General Elections, Binner was the Socialist candidate and achieved 2nd place with 16.8% of votes.2011 Argentine general election Despite this number being well below the 54.1% achieved by Peronist leader Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, the Socialist Party considered the results of the election as significant and a sign of renewed interest by a sector of the population. In May 2012, Binner became the Socialist Party's president.Binner asumi√≥ la presidencia del Partido Socialista, P√°gina/12, 2012-05-09 For the 2015 general election, the PS entered in coalition with other centre-left and left-wing parties to form the Progresistas (Progressives) front, which endorsed Margarita Stolbizer for the presidency. Stolbizer landed 5th in the election with just over 2.5% of the vote, failing to pass the threshold for the run-off. During the same elections, Socialist Miguel Lifschitz was elected Governor of Santa Fe, succeeding Antonio Bonfatti (also of the PS). In April 2016, Bonfatti was chosen to succeed Binner as national president of the party. Following the 2017 legislative election, the party was left with a single national deputy, Luis Contigiani, and no representatives in the Senate. In 2018, Contigiani left the Socialist Party's bloc in the Chamber of Deputies after being criticized by his party for refusing to vote in favor of a bill that would legalize abortion in the country. In 2019 election PS didn't elect any deputies; however, socialist politician Enrique Estevez was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the list of the Progressive, Civic and Social Front, and thus the Socialist Party regained its representation in the Congress.

Ian McDonald (born 1960) is a British science fiction novelist, living in Belfast. His themes include nanotechnology, postcyberpunk settings, and the impact of rapid social and technological change on non-Western societies. Early life Ian McDonald was born in 1960, in Manchester, to a Scottish father and Irish mother. He moved to Belfast when he was five and has lived there ever since. He lived through the whole of the 'Troubles' (1968‚Äì1999), and his sensibility has been permanently shaped by coming to understand Northern Ireland as a post-colonial society imposed on an older culture. He became a fan of science fiction from childhood TV, and began writing when he was 9. Career McDonald sold his first story to a local Belfast magazine when he was 22, and in 1987 became a full-time writer.John Lennard, Ian McDonald: Chaga / Evolution's Shore (Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2007), p. 7. He has also worked in TV consultancy within Northern Ireland, contributing scripts to the Northern Irish Sesame Workshop production of Sesame Tree. McDonald's debut novel was Desolation Road (1988), which takes place on a far future Mars in a town that develops around an oasis in the terraformed Martian desert. He published a sequel, Ares Express, in 2001. Published between 1995 and 2000, the novels Chaga (US title Evolution's Shore) and Kirinya, with the novella Tendel√©o's Story, form the 'Chaga Saga', which chronicles the effects of an alien flora introduced to Earth, and also analyses the AIDS crisis in Africa. The protagonist is Ulster journalist Gaby McAslin, whose outsider's eye both observes the African landscape and sees what the \\"UN quarantine zone\\" is doing to Kenya and Kenyans. Gaby's story, with that of her daughter, continues in Kirinya. Tendel√©o's Story is seen through the eyes of a young Kenyan girl who escapes to the UK, only to be deported back to Kenya as an unwanted alien. McDonald's River of Gods (2004) is set in mid-21st-century India; it won the BSFA award, and was nominated for a Hugo Award and a Clarke Award. Brasyl (2007) is set in the 18th and 21st centuries in Lusophone South America; it won the BSFA award, and was nominated for a Hugo Award and the Warwick Prize for Writing. McDonald began his Everness series of young adult fiction novels in 2011 with Planesrunner. He said in a 2014 interview, \\"I didn't want to get stuck doing the same SF books over and over, successful though they may be. I didn't want to keep writing books about the developing economy of the year‚ÄîIndia, Brazil. I could feel myself getting trapped in that.\\" He has written two Everness sequels, Be My Enemy (2012), and Empress of the Sun (2014). McDonald published Luna: New Moon, the first volume of a proposed science fiction duology, in 2015. It explores the dangerous intrigue that surrounds the five powerful families who control industry on the Moon. McDonald said of the novel in August 2014, \\"I‚Äôm still writing about developing economies, it‚Äôs just that this one happens to be on the Moon.\\" Before critics called the novel \\"Game of Thrones in space\\", McDonald himself dubbed it \\"Game of Domes\\" and \\"Dallas in space\\". Luna was optioned for development as a television series before its release. The sequel, Luna: Wolf Moon, was released in March 2017. A third novel, Luna: Moon Rising, was released in March 2019. McDonald previously published the novelette \\"The Fifth Dragon\\", a prequel to Luna in the same setting, in the 2014 anthology Reach for Infinity.

It is located in the newly formed Region A (formerly regions 1 and 2) of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Law and order is extremely bad here. It is made up of fully government-subsidised housing (Extensions 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10), brick houses built by landowners (Extensions 2 and 7), partially government subsidised houses (Extension 3/Tanganani) as well as shacks (the biggest sections being Extensions 1, 12, and 13). A large proportion (45.5%) of residents rent their property from a landowner who has subdivided their land. History Diepsloot township is not far from the wealthy suburbs of Dainfern and Steyn City, Gauteng, and was established in 1994 as a transit camp for some of the people who had been removed from Zevenfontein (informally known as eSgodiphola), a squatter camp right next to Chartwell that had been there since the late 80's. The people who remained behind in Zevenfontein had chosen to be moved to a different place, Cosmo City, which only started happening 10 years later at the end of 2005. Initially 1,124 plots were made available. People were to stay in the transit camp until land elsewhere became available. For many, this camp became a permanent home. The Transvaal Provincial Administration, which was then the local authority, developed the plots into formal housing stands. In 1999, the former Northern Municipality Local Council began to initiate formal development in the area. There were about 4000 families living in backyard shacks and 6,035 families in the reception area, a transit zone established by the city council, says Alan Kitchin, the special projects assistant director in the City of Johannesburg's housing department. To compound the congestion, in 2001 the Gauteng government moved about 5,000 families to Diepsloot from the banks of the Jukskei River in Alexandra. The move, part of the Alexandra Renewal Project, was intended \\"to de-congest and address the need to create a healthy and clean living environment\\" in Alexandra, one of South Africa's oldest townships. The aim was also to prevent shacks being washed away when the river flooded, something that happened year after year. The influx of people from Alexandra placed further strain on the already stretched resources in Diepsloot. The relocated families did not qualify for housing benefits. Modern day So far, 4 900 Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses have been constructed in Diepsloot; another 737 housing stands with water and sanitation facilities have been allocated. The national housing policy has moved away from the mass provision of standard RDP houses: it now follows the People's Housing Process model, a project being implemented in Diepsloot West. RDP houses are still being constructed, but the new process has the state provide a subsidy that covers the cost of building a house. The prospective home owner is expected to pay a portion of the costs. Diepsloot is now home to about 140,000 people; many of them living in shacks 3√ó2 m assembled from scrap metal, wood, plastic and cardboard. Some families lack access to basic services such as running water, sewage and rubbish removal. All extensions except for extensions 1, 5, 12 and 13 have tar roads, drainage and street lights. Members of the local council live in all extensions, except extension 5. Extensions 1 and 5 often get flooded in the heavy summer rains as the water from the mall also runs down into their roads. Residents use paraffin and electric stoves for cooking. According to the 2011 census, 18,4% of dwellers have piped water inside their dwelling, 61,2% have electricity and 74,1% have access to a flush toilet connected to the sewage system. The majority of shacks which have access to electricity use a prepaid meter, but this is becoming increasingly expensive and is used sparingly. Popular culture Diepsloot was featured on the BBC program Law and Disorder in Johannesburg. Karl Pilkington visited Diepsloot and talked to a group of students as a part of Season Two of An Idiot Abroad in 2011. Causes of poverty around Diepsloot Diepsloot is generally described as a notorious settlement full of crime, violent protests and unpredictability. This place is inhabited by people from different tribes, cultures, traditions and nationalities, many of whom have no educational background or a skill asset which they can use to find employment. The lack of education or skill set may be due to material deprivation, lack of security and the absence or dysfunctional needs such as water and sanitation infrastructure development. The above mentioned factors have a detrimental effect on employment opportunities towards Diepsloot dwellers as employers cannot hire people with no basic education or skill set and come from a community that is generally described as violent and full of crime References * Further reading * External links City of Johannesburg website * Constant Fear and Mob Rule in South Africa Slum, The New York Times, June 2009 Johannesburg Region A Shanty towns in South Africa Townships in Gauteng ","title":"Diepsloot"},{"id":"1390555","text":":For the informal settlement in Johannesburg, see Kya Sands Kya Sand is an industrial suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

Recently some streets have been boomed in order to provide Northcliff's high-income residents with more security and exclusivity. Although erroneously included by Google Maps as part of Randburg, Northcliff has never been part of Randburg. It is located in Region B of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. History The suburb is situated on part of an old Witwatersrand farm called Waterval. It was established on 3 October 1934 and named after the northerly ridge. Geography Topography View from Northcliff Ridge (1978) Northcliff Hill (also known as Aasvo√´lkop (Vulture Ridge) due to the cliffs being predominantly inhabited by these birds of prey before being urbanised) is believed to have been populated by humans for over 250,000 years. At 1807 metres, the ridge is the second highest point in Johannesburg, being one metre lower than Observatory Ridge. It has three vegetation zones and is inhabited by many different animals.

Roodepoort is a town in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Formerly an independent municipality, Roodepoort became part of the Johannesburg municipality in the late 1990s, along with Randburg and Sandton. Johannesburg's most famous botanical garden, Witwatersrand National Botanical Gardens (now renamed Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden), is located in Roodepoort. History In 1884, brothers Fred and Harry Struben, having discovered gold on the farm Wilgespruit at the western end of the Witwatersrand, were granted concessions to mine the area. When George Harrison's find at Langlaagte came to light and gold fever took hold, the Strubens brothers were joined by a swarm of gold diggers. Other areas such as Maraisburg were prospected and mined by A.P. Marais and at Florida, the owners were van der Hoven, Bantjies and Lys. Though the Struben brothers' Confidence Reef bore little gold and their mine was unprofitable, the ramshackle town that grew around it became the Roodepoort Municipality in 1904. Incorporating the towns of Hamburg, Florida and Maraisburg, Roodepoort became a city in 1977, and has since developed as one of Johannesburg's most prominently- Afrikaans-speaking districts. Geography Communities Residential areas in the new developing parts of Roodepoort are expanding at a faster pace than anywhere else in South Africa. This growth is said to be fueled by various factors such as the fast-growing Black middle class, the close proximity to other large Gauteng cities and established and advanced infrastructure. Ethnicity Traditionally, Roodeport was an Afrikaaans- speaking area, but after apartheid, the area has attracted different ethnic groups and the dominant language is now English. The rapid expansion of middle-class housing in the area has caused an influx of all ethnic groups but mostly of the middle class. Economy Retail Westgate Mall is situated in West Roodepoort and is one of the 'Four Gates' to Johannesburg. Roodepoort has seen large population growth due to Johannesburg urban sprawl. There are three major malls in the area - Clearwater Mall, the most upscale in Roodepoort, Cradelstone Mall, built in 2015 and Westgate Mall the largest and oldest. Areas of interest for entertainment include the Featherbrooke Village centre which is close to Monash University and is a student hotspots. Roodepoort has a wide variety of restaurants and shopping centres. The CBD of the city has shifted from its historical center (now dominated by crime and grime) to a location close to the 14th Avenue off ramp. Regional headquarters of banks, a large hospital, various office parks and two large hotels are found in the new CBD. Roodepoort still has a large industrial sector along Main Reef road. A number of logistical firms work from the area as well as other light industry. Sport The city has a large golf course called Ruimsig Country Club in the suburb Ruimsig. Another smaller golf course is the Jackel Creek Golf Estate. In between the two there is a links golf course Eagle Canyon. Further south in Roodepoort there's a golf course called CMR Golf Club. Roodepoort Athletics Stadium is also found within the city. It has three mega private gym facilities owned by Virgin Active and Planet Fitness. Parks and greenspace The Roodepoort area has numerous parks and green areas. Walter Sisulu Botanical Garden, formerly known as the Witwatersrand National Botanical Garden, is a 300 hectares (3.0 km2) botanical reserve with grass parks, natural cliff face and waterfall. Another large greenspace is the Kloofendal Nature Reserve, a 128ha park with trails, amphitheatre, dam and small wild mammals. Further to the south is Florida Lake with its bird life and related aquatic activities. Law and government Government Although Roodepoort has traditionally been regarded as being part of the West Rand, it was not made part of the West Rand District Municipality, instead being integrated into the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, following the post-apartheid reorganisation of local government in the late 1990s. Education Schools Roodepoort is home to several private and state schools, including Maragon, Trinity House, Charter College, West Ridge High School, Horizon View Primary, Ho√´rskool Roodepoort and Ruimsig Academy. University In 2001 Monash University Australia opened a campus in Roodepoort called Monash South Africa (MSA). The University pulled out of South Africa in 2018 but sold the University to the Independent Institute of Education.

It has many small suburbs within it, namely extensions 1, 2 and 3, Mmesi Park, Snake Park and many others. It has many primary and high schools, including Hector Peterson Primary School, which was built in memory of Hector Peterson. There are recreational facilities such as Dorothy Nyembe Park, a local library, and a swimming pool. Opposite the swimming pool is Dobsonville stadium. Kopanong community hall and the municipal offices can be found close by. Other amenities include a recycling centre, a police station, and a public health clinic. There are many businesses in Dobsonville that range from franchise restaurants to street vendors who sell anything from cellphone chargers to traditional herbs and medicines to sweets and fruit. While more attention has been given to the more prominent Meadowlands - with its roots in the famous Sophiatown - and Orlando o home to the Mandela's and Tambo's, but Dobsonville's history has yet to be written. Dobsonville is a township in greater Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. It lies to the west of Meadowlands, a part of Diepmeadow, and is adjacent to Mofolo North and Zondi, which are suburbs of Soweto on its southern border. History It was formerly under the Roodepoort Municipality until 1994, when it was merged with Soweto. Dobsonville is an important but understudied suburb of Soweto. Its roots lie in the \\"old location\\" in Roodepoort. Between 1955 and 1967 this location was gradually destroyed through government forced removals. The old location was known for the strong presence and influence of many churches. While the removals were not particularly noted for resistance (perhaps because of the violence with which resistance to removals was met with in Sophiatown), the links between the old location and Dobsonville remained strong and emotive. The cemetery of the old location in Roodepoort West for example maintained a physical link between old and new location. While some heritage projects and research around the histories of the old Roodepoort location were undertaken, there has been little work on the history of Dobsonville itself. More than a 100 oral testimonies of Dobsonville residents have been collected by researchers from the Wits History Workshop (University of Witwatersrand) for their Dobsonville History Project. However some oral interviews remain unpublished. See \\" Return to Juliwe Cemetery: A Community Journey\\" Article by Eric Itzkin 6 April 2019. The Research was conducted by Wits History Workshop Researchers: 1\\\\. Prof. Phil Bonner. 2\\\\. Dr. Michelle Hay. 3\\\\. Mr. Sello Mathabatha. 4\\\\. Dr. Tshepo Moloi. 5\\\\.

Mr Muzomuhle Caluza.(Intern) The St Ansgars Swedish Mission Complex in Roodepoort West East of the Westgate Shopping Mall (South Africa)  Westgate Shopping Mall over Ontdekkers Road and Bordered by Pheasant Street and Crous Drive was the area where the above complex was situated. The area has changed from what it looked like before the removals where many residents of Roodepoort West Location (Juliwe) earned their living one way or another. The History of the area is groundbreaking and largely ignored or unknown to Historians. The complex was home to: (a)The St Ansgars Swedish Institution Established in 1913. closed in 1958.[5] (b) The Ezenzeleni School for the Blind Established in 1939. Later moved to Pretoria, Established by Arthur William Blaxall[6] (c) The Kutlwanong School for the Deaf and Dumb Established in 1939 [7] Precursor to Sizwile School for the Deaf in Dobsonville. (Suzan Kabane interviewed by Dr. Tshepo Moloi, WITS) (d) The Margaret Ballinger Home for Crippled or Orphaned Children Established in 1948 [8] by Margaret Ballinger (Teacher and Politician) (e) The Wilgespruit Fellowship Centre Established in 1948 and hotbed of struggle politics of the 70s and 80s.[9] (f) MSAHO: The International Library of African Music . (Hugh Tracey - Rhodes University)[10] We can say that the complex was a vibrant extended part of the Roodepoort West Location with the St Ansgars Institution \\"The Lovedale College of Roodepoort\\" at the center. Some of the renowned South Africans passed through the gates of this once illustrious Institution. [11] The schools of Ezenzeleni or Kutlwanong, [12] creations of that dedicated clergyman, Father William Blaxall were places of hope for the disabled persons of Roodepoort West Location and South Africa at large. [13] The Wilgespruit Fellowship Centre was, as indicated above, the political struggle Institution which further gave impetus to the freedom struggles of South Africa's Black Population. [14] Lastly, Hugh Tracey, that famous collector of many African Music Genres and Eric Gallo set up a Vinyl Record Pressing Plant at Msaho in the very early 1950s. [15] The first of its kind in South Africa and created employment for many residents of the location (Township). In the foreground of photo No 4 (Aerial Photograph taken in 1967 after demolition of Juliwe Township) In Eric Itzkins Article \\"Return To Juliwe: A Community Journey\\" Bordered by a line of trees, Is an open veld crisscrossed by footpaths, stands today 7-1-20 the Westgate Shopping Mall, the veld being called \\"Mr. Browns Farm\\" by neighbouring residents of the location (Township). The Border is still visible and noticeable next to the Ontdekkers Road off-ramp circle into the mall from Johannesburg. Beyond the straight line of trees and South West of the St Ansgars Mission Complex is the location of Roodepoort West now the suburb of Horizon View which we will deal with next. Roodepoort Location Like its sister locations on the Reef, the evolution of the location was, in many respects the same. [16] Before its removal as a \\"Black Spot\\" to Dobsonville (So named after Denis Dobson, Location Superintendent at t he dawn of teh removals) It had evolved for more than 50 yrs with Its multi ethnic inhabitants much like its sister locations. [17] Just like in every community, adversity has to be overcome by various means, by religion, the arts, politics, sport, business and so on. Like in very community or society there will be outstanding individuals or groups of individuals who will triumph over adversity. We will try as best as we can, to focus on the day to day lives of the inhabitants, the conditions under which they had to survive. The laws that controlled their lives. Their contributions to the development of the economies of the town they lived in. 'The Survey of Reef Locations' gives us a remote picture of the state of affairs in Roodepoort Location in the mid to late 1930s. From that can be deduced the \\"Primitive\\" Sport Facilities that had to be utilized by Sportsmen of the location for example. [18] There was for example the menace of criminal gangs (Multi Ethnic) who would turn against each other along ethnic lines later in Dobsonville (\\"The Black Swines\\") in the Nguni Section and (\\"The Apaches\\") in the Tswana Section. These being former neighbours in the Roodepoort Location [19] Their demise would be brought about by the eruption of the June 1976 Student Riots. Things would never be the same for the gangs. The recognition given to Piet \\"Oom Piet\\" Gwele is no fluke.[20] Gwele, (longtime inhabitant of Roodepoort West Location) and father of celebrated Jazz Pianist Boycie \\"Piano Fingers\\" Gwele pioneered the game of Cricket on the Rand. Having played the game in the Eastern Cape early last century, on to the diamond field of Kimberly, and finally to the Rand (Rand Leases/Gold Mine). His contribution to African Cricket on the Rand in the 1930s and 1940s is unsurpassed. During his cricketing career, he had groomed the likes of prolific all-rounder Samson Ntshekisa and the mecurical Sydney Hashe to name but a few. Gwele was also instrumental in the formation of the Cup Winning Local Cricket Club \\"DobsonXI\\" Gwele,s remains lie in the Juliwe Cemetery, Horizon View. Roodepoort. [21] Ntshekisa and Hashe's remains lie in the Doornkop Cemetery, in Dobsonville. The bread and butter sport of football in Native Locations (Townships) is extensively written about elsewhere and its not dealt with in this article. \\"Khawuleza\\" meaning (Hurry Mama Hurry) International singer and songwriter Mirriam Makeba, in singing this song, later beautifully improvised by equally world renowned Jazz Trumpeter Hugh Masekela would have seen the worst of the dark days of the Liquor and Bantu Beer Prohibition in the locations and slums of the log drawn-out war about (Bantu Beer, Barbeton, Skokiaan, Pineapple etc.) between the \\"Authorities\\" and shebeen queens of the Rand, which started as far back as the sunrise of Gold and Coal mining on the Witwatersrand. A somewhat more detailed account of this war is dealt with by (Eales). [23] The \\"Authorities\\" would finally win the day in the lucrative African Beer Brewing and Selling Business in almost every \\"Native\\" (As they were called then) Location on the Reef. The livelihoods of many an African woman (especially the Shebeen Queens) would die a slow death. Naturally, booze and music go together, starting with (Marabi of the 1930s to Tsaba - Tsaba pf t eh 1940s and Kwela of the 1950s) and being an attractive element in the patronage of Shebeens in Roodepoort West Location (Juliwe). A vivid picture of this scenario is elegantly captured i (Allen's) work. [24] The role of the \\"Church Music\\" will be dealt with later in the article. Many former residents, in their oral testimonies have fondly reminisced about the good old days of the local \\"Edwin Fieldhouse Hall\\" A Recreational Centre of the location. Rev Fieldhouse was mayor of Roodepoort 1947-1948 and was instrumental, together with D.W. Mooki and T. Huddleston in the establishment of that famous high school \\"Orlando High School\\".[25] The above article is contributed by Kgatitswe Raborife, Nomfanelo Renene and Lerato \\"Shimi\\" Setlhare.

It featured the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive named after Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop. The locomotive made its first test run on December 24, 1949. It pulled a set of freight cars, as well as a caboose that was almost entirely built by Disney himself. It was Disney's lifelong fascination with trains, as well as his interest in miniature models, that led to the creation of the CPRR. The railroad, which became operational in 1950, was long and encircled his house. The backyard railroad attracted visitors to Disney's home; he invited them to ride and occasionally drive his miniature train. In 1953, after an accident occurred in which a guest was injured, the CPRR was closed to the public. The Carolwood Pacific Railroad inspired Disney to include railroad attractions in the design for the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. Railroad attractions in Disney theme parks around the world are now commonplace. The barn structure that was used as the railroad's control center is now at the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. The Lilly Belle, some of the freight cars, and the caboose are now on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. History alt=A diagram of a model railroad layout consisting of a loop of track encircling a house, garage, and pool, interlaced with a figure-eight section of track surrounding a small barn Walt Disney, the owner of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, was a rail enthusiast... As a young boy, he wanted to become a train engineer like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who drove main-line trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway... Disney's father worked as part of a track installation crew for the Union Pacific Railroad. As a teenager, Disney worked as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway, where he sold newspapers, candy, cigars, and other products on trains.. He sometimes climbed over the tender and into the locomotive's cab while the train was in motion.. After he bribed the engineer and fireman with chewing tobacco, they showed him how to operate the locomotive. Disney renewed his interest in trains after injuries forced him to stop playing polo.. Seeking a calmer recreational activity, he purchased several Lionel train sets in late 1947. By 1948, his interest in model trains was evolving into an interest in larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and backyard railroad layouts of several hobbyists.. These hobbyists included Disney animator Ollie Johnston, who had a ridable miniature railroad, as well as Disney animator Ward Kimball, who owned the full-size, narrow-gauge Grizzly Flats Railroad.. On June 1, 1949, Disney purchased of vacant land in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.. The property consisted of a bluff, which was in size, and a level shelf of land behind it, which Disney named Yensid Valley... The word Yensid is Disney spelled backwards. Disney purchased this land to build a new family home with an elaborate backyard railroad behind it. Plans for the railroad's layout included of -inch () gauge track with eleven switches, as well as gradients, overpasses, a trestle, and an elevated dirt berm... The layout would completely surround the house. Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, objected to the plan that part of the layout be built in an area where she intended to plant a flower garden. As a compromise, Disney had an S-curve tunnel built underneath the spot where the garden was eventually planted. Aided by a Walt Disney Studios attorney, Disney had a tongue-in-cheek legal contract written to establish his right to own and operate the railroad's right of way... He and his wife signed the contract and their two daughters witnessed it. Disney named his railroad Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) in reference to his address at 355 Carolwood Drive. The railroad eventually cost $50,000, split evenly between its layout and rolling stock.. alt=A ridable miniature steam locomotive, tender, and yellow-colored caboose in a display case with an image of a desert behind them The railroad featured the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive named after Disney's wife and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team led by Roger E. Broggie... The locomotive's design, chosen by Disney after seeing a smaller locomotive model with the same design at the home of rail historian Gerald M. Best, was based directly on copies of the blueprints for the Central Pacific No. 173, a 4-4-0 steam locomotive rebuilt by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1872. The initials for the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, CPRR, matched the initials for the Central Pacific Railroad, one of the railroads that helped complete the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869.. Under Broggie's guidance, Disney helped build several parts for the Lilly Belle, including its smokestack and headlamp. Most of the machining was done by Broggie's machine shop team, and the wooden cab was built by Disney personally.. On December 24, 1949, the Lilly Belle and its tender were first test run on a small loop of track during the studio's Christmas party in front of the staff. The tender could carry up to of water and of coal crushed to scale-sized lumps to fuel the locomotive.. Disney ran the Lilly Belle on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad for the first time on May 7, 1950.. The CPRR's train cars consisted of six cast-metal, wood-grain-patterned gondolas made by the studio's machine shop.. There were also two boxcars, two stock cars, a flatcar, and a caboose made of wood from the studio's prop shop. Disney's fascination with miniature models was apparent from the level of detail he applied to the miniature interior of the caboose, which included a calendar hung on the wall, a broom, and a working potbelly stove.. Except for its frame and trucks, Disney built the entire caboose himself. All of the train cars, except for the caboose, were stored in the CPRR's tunnel when not in use. The CPRR's caboose was stored in a special barn where Disney monitored and controlled the CPRR's track. The barn's design was based on a set piece for the 1949 Disney film So Dear to My Heart, and it brought back Disney's childhood memories of a similar barn on his family farm in Marceline, Missouri... The barn had a centralized traffic control board, which had several lights designed to indicate the presence of trains along the railroad's route. The CPRR's switches could also be electrically controlled from this board. Articles about the CPRR appeared in several magazines, including the September 1951 issue of Look magazine. These articles attracted visitors interested in the CPRR to the home of Disney, who invited them to ride and occasionally drive his miniature train.. With a tractive effort of more than , the Lilly Belle could pull a train with up to 12 adult passengers. Due to its lack of brakes, the locomotive was set in reverse if it ever needed to stop quickly.. In early 1953, a visitor drove the Lilly Belle too fast along a curve, causing it to derail.. As a result, the Lilly Belle fell on its side, broke its whistle, and released a jet of steam across the ground. A five-year-old girl ran through the steam jet, which left minor burns on her legs. As a result of this incident, Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the CPRR and stored the locomotive in the studio's machine shop.. Disney removed the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track in 1964. Influences alt=A red steam locomotive with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement (four leading wheels, four driving wheels, and no trailing wheels) passing over a bridge Walt Disney credited the Carolwood Pacific Railroad with inspiring the creation of Disneyland in Anaheim, California.. In one early concept for the park, the CPRR was included as an attraction, in which its train would carry passengers past miniature towns and settings.. The Casey Jr. Circus Train, a different ridable miniature railroad that travels past miniature scenes of animated Disney films, is one of Disneyland's original attractions.. Another early design for the park included a narrow-gauge steam railroad encircling it, a feature which was retained in the park's final design... Disneyland, and the Disneyland Railroad encircling the park, opened on July 17, 1955... The Disneyland Railroad's No. 1 locomotive, the C.K. Holliday, bears a strong resemblance to the CPRR's Lilly Belle, since their designs were based on the same blueprints.. There are also steam railroads in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida; Tokyo Disneyland in Japan; and Disneyland Park near Paris. Copies of the blueprints for the CPRR's Lilly Belle were sold to model railroad hobbyists through a company named Walt Disney Miniature Railroad, formed by Disney in 1950 as a legally separate entity from Walt Disney Productions.. After that company evolved into Walt Disney, Inc., in 1952 and had its name changed to WED Enterprises in 1953, it developed rides and attractions for Disneyland and later Walt Disney World.. In 1965, Walt Disney Productions purchased WED Enterprises, and in 1986 changed its name to Walt Disney Imagineering.. According to Los Angeles magazine, the CPRR's barn has been referred to as the \\"birthplace of Imagineering\\". As well as inspiring rail attractions at Disney theme parks, the CPRR became the inspiration for the 1951 Disney animated short film Out of Scale, in which Donald Duck is portrayed running a ridable miniature railroad in his backyard.. The train of the CPRR also appeared in several Disney television specials in the 1950s... Preservation alt=A red barn with white trim and a shingle roof In 1965, Walt Disney donated of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track, as well as the railroad's trestle, to the Los Angeles Live Steamers, a group of miniature steam train enthusiasts.. Disney was a charter member of that group. The completion of the CPRR's track installation at the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was celebrated on October 22, 1966, and the route utilizing that track became known as the Disney Loop. This event occurred a few weeks before Disney's death on December 15, 1966.. In 1968, Lillian Disney donated the rest of the CPRR's track to the Los Angeles Live Steamers.. The original CPRR track on the Disney Loop has since been removed and replaced with newer, more durable track. After Lillian Disney died in 1997, the Disney residence, including the area where the CPRR was located, was put up for sale. Mexican investor Gabriel Brener, who bought the property in 1998, demolished the original house due to issues with lead paint, lead piping, asbestos, and a weak foundation. The CPRR's tunnel was still in place in 2013. In 2014, the property was sold to an unknown buyer. In 1999, Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, the CPRR's former control center, was relocated to the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum. Morgan \\"Bill\\" Evans, the original landscaper of the Disney residence and several Disney theme parks, arranged for Walt Disney Imagineering to provide a landscaping plan for the barn's new site. On July 19, 1999, Diane Disney Miller, Disney's daughter, participated in the rededication ceremony for the barn. Since 2009, the CPRR's Lilly Belle, some of the freight cars, and the caboose have been on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. There are also two pieces of CPRR rolling stock on display inside the Carolwood Pacific Railroad Room in the Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge within Walt Disney World.

During testing, a FWD subjects the pavement surface to a load pulse which simulates the load produced by a rolling vehicle wheel. The load pulse is produced by dropping a large weight onto a \\"buffer\\" which shapes the pulse, and then transmitted to the pavement through a circular load plate. Data are acquired from various sensors for use in post-test analysis of pavement properties. Deflection sensors are used to measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load pulse. In some FWDs the magnitude of the applied load pulse is an assumed constant value determined by system design; in others the force is measured by load cells. The load plate may be solid or segmented. Segmented load plates adapt to the shape of the pavement to more evenly distribute the load on uneven surfaces. The load plate diameter is typically 300 mm diameter on roads and 450 mm on airports, and the load for road testing is about 40 kN, producing about 567 kPa pressure under the load plate (50 kN / 707 kPa according to European standard). Load impact system There are two different types of load impact systems; single-mass and double-mass. In a single-mass system, a weight is dropped onto a single buffer connected to a load plate, which in turn rests on the surface being tested. Single-mass FWDs are typically smaller, faster and less expensive but, when used on soft soils, may overestimate the capacity of pavements due to the mass inertia of the pavement material. In a double-mass system, the weight drops onto an assembly consisting of a first buffer, a second weight, and a second buffer. This produces a longer loading duration that more precisely simulates a wheel load, and yields higher reproducibility and gives a more accurate result on pavements built on soft soils. In all systems, the load pulse shape and rise time is important because it can affect the peak values of center deflection by as much as 10% to 20%. Deflection sensors Deflection sensors are used to measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load pulse. The sensors are mounted radially from the center of the load plate at typical offsets of 0, 200, 300, 450, 600, 900, 1200 and 1500 mm (the deflections measured at these offsets are denoted D0, D200, D300, etc.). Two types of deflection sensors are used: geophones and force-balance seismometers. Seismometers have built-in calibration devices and higher deflection measurement ranges (5 mm vs 2 mm). Geophones lack built-in calibration devices and are more sensitive to disturbances immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated, but are much less expensive than seismometers.  Analysis  FWD data is most often used to calculate stiffness-related parameters of a pavement structure. The process of calculating the elastic moduli of individual layers in a multi-layer system (e.g. asphalt concrete on top of a base course on top of the subgrade) based on surface deflections is known as \\"backcalculation\\", as there is no closed-form solution. Instead, initial moduli are assumed, surface deflections calculated, and then the moduli are adjusted in an iterative fashion to converge on the measured deflections. This process is computationally intensive although quick on modern computers. It can give quite misleading results and requires an experienced analyst. Commonly used backcalculation software are: * BAKFAA (Federal Aviation Administration) * Clevercalc (University of Washington) * ELMOD (Dynatest) * Evercalc (WSDOT) * KGPBACK (Geotran) * MichBack (Michigan DOT) * Modulus (TxDOT) * PVD (KUAB) * PRIMAX DESIGN / RoSy Design (Sweco, former Carl Bro) Many analysts use simplified methods to calculate related parameters that are empirical in nature. The most common is maximum deflection under the centre of the load plate (D0) which is related to empirical measures such as the Benkelman Beam deflection (after minor adjustment for differences in the two devices). Historically some used the radius of curvature (D0-D200) but this is out of favour now because it is clear that the steel loading plate of 300mm diameter affects the shape of the deflection bowl between the centre (D0) and the D200 sensor at 200mm. However this means that a lot of useful information about the shape of the deflected bowl is wasted. Horak and Emery have published indices that use this information: BLI=D0-D300 and gives an indication of the basecourse performance, MLI = D300-D600 and gives an indication of the subbase performance, and LLI=D600-D900 and gives an indication of subgrade performance. These and other similar indices are known as shape factors. The FWD data can also be very useful in helping the engineer divide the length of the pavement into homogeneous sections. FWD data can also be used to calculate the degree of load transfer between adjacent concrete slabs, and to detect voids under slabs. Other models A Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) is a portable falling weight deflectometer used primarily to test insitu base and subgrade moduli during construction. LWD measurement is faster than the isotope measuring method and requires no reference measurements. The equipment has no radioactive sources and can be operated by one person, allowing for on-site data analysis and report printing. Some LWDs have no load cell and assume a nominal load value, whereas others employ a load cell to measure the actual load. Depending on the system, a LWD may have a single geophone located in the centre or it may have two geophones, typically located at 300 and 600 mm positions. A Fast Falling Weight Deflectometer (FFWD) is a FWD with pneumatic or electric actuators rather than hydraulic, making the mechanics several times faster. A Heavy Weight Deflectometer (HWD) is a falling weight deflectometer that has higher loads (typically 300 kN to 600 kN), used primarily for testing airport pavements. A common misconception is that higher loads are needed to test an airport's capability to handle heavy aircraft, but in fact, the testing methods are not designed to test the strength of the construction but to find the material properties of the construction. A Rolling Weight Deflectometer (RWD) is a deflectometer that can gather data at a much higher speed (as high as 55 mph) than the FWD, which allows the data to be collected without traffic control and lane closure. It is a implemented as a tractor-trailer with laser measuring devices mounted on a beam under the trailer. Unlike the FWD, which pauses to make measurements, a RWD gathers deflection data while it travels. The test materials are described in ASTM D 4694, and the test method is defined in ASTM D 4695.140 Notes References Pavement engineering ","title":"Falling weight deflectometer"},{"id":"1390613","text":"Protea Glen is a suburb of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa, located north of Lenasia and west of Soweto.

An oncology nurse is a specialized nurse who cares for cancer patients. These nurses require advanced certifications and clinical experiences in oncology further than the typical baccalaureate nursing program provides. Oncology nursing care can defined as meeting the various needs of oncology patients during the time of their disease including appropriate screenings and other preventive practices, symptom management, care to retain as much normal functioning as possible, and supportive measures upon end of life. Certification in the United States The Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation (ONCC) offers several different options for board certification in oncological nursing. Certification is a voluntary process and ensures that a nurse has proper qualifications and knowledge of a specialty area and has kept up-to-date in his or her education. The ONCC offers eight options for certification: * Basic: ** OCN: Oncology Certified Nurse ** CPON: Certified Pediatric Oncology Nurse ** CPHON: Certified Pediatric Hematology Oncology Nurse * Specialty: ** BMTCN: Blood and Marrow Transplant Certified Nurse ** CBCN: Certified Breast Care Nurse * Advanced: ** AOCN: Advanced Oncology Certified Nurse ** AOCNP: Advanced Oncology Certified Nurse Practitioner ** AOCNS: Advanced Oncology Certified Clinical Nurse Specialist Certification is granted for four years, after which it must be renewed by taking a recertification test or by earning a certain number of continuing education credits. To become certified, nurses must have an RN license, meet specific eligibility criteria for nursing experience and specialty practice, and must pass a multiple-choice test. For the advanced AOCNP and AOCNS certifications, a nurse must have a master's degree or higher in nursing and a minimum of 500 hours of supervised clinical practice of oncology nursing. The AOCNP certification also requires successful completion of an accredited nurse practitioner program.  Oncology Nursing in Morocco   Demand  The demand for oncology nurses is enormous in Morocco. Statistics of the Moroccan Ministry of Health indicate that the death toll of malignant neoplasms mounts to 17 thousands a year. The number of patients with cancer is believed to be three-times the number of annual deaths. A recent study of the European Institute of Health Sciences (Institut Europ√©en des Sciences de la Sant√©) projected that the need for oncology nurses in 2025 is estimated at 5 thousand nurses. Yet, the number of qualified oncology nurses in the country is equal to nil. The reason is obviously the absence of a formal educational program in oncology nursing. Oncology nursing training in Morocco Currently there currently exists only one educational program in oncology nursing that is being offered by the European Institute of Health Sciences. It has been approved by the Ministry of Higher Education as well as the Ministry of Health in 2014. The duration of this Bachelor of Science program in Oncology Nursing is 3 years and encompasses a total of 6 thousands hours, equivalent to 120 semester credits in the US educational system and 180 ECTS in the European system. The program attracts a large number of students from African countries. Certification requirements in Morocco In Morocco, there exists no system for certification of oncology nurses. However, graduates of the oncology nursing program of the European Institute of Health Sciences can set for certification exams abroad, particularly in European countries. Roles Oncology nurses, like any Registered Nurse have a large variety of settings they can work in. Oncology nurses can work inpatient settings such as hospitals, outpatient settings, in hospice services, or in physician offices. There are a variety of specialties such as radiation, surgery, pediatric, or gynecologic. Oncology nurses have advanced knowledge of assessing the client‚Äôs status and from this assessment will help the multi-disciplinary medical team to develop a treatment plan. Education The nurse must also educate the patient on their condition, its side effects, its treatment plan, and how to prevent possible complications. This education should be done effectively throughout the treatment of the disease, according to the teaching style that best suits the particular patient. According to the Oncology Nursing Standards, the patient or caregivers for the patient should understand the state of the disease and the therapy used at their education level, understand the therapy schedule and when it is being used, be involved in decisions regarding their own care, and state interventions for serious side effects and complications of the disease and intervention. Treatment Nurses must be able to manage the many side effects associated with cancer and the treatment. Nurses must have extensive knowledge of pharmacological and nonpharmacological nursing interventions, and when they are appropriate to use. Chemotherapy Oncology nurses must have appropriate training in the administration, handling, side effects, and dosing of chemotherapy. Each institution will have its own policies for various chemotherapy drugs to ensure adequate training and for prevention of errors. The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation (ONCC) offer a Chemotherapy/Biotherapy training course available to any oncology nurse to ensure the safe administration and management of side effects of chemotherapy and biotherapy agents. This course consists of 16 contact hours. This certification needs to be renewed after two years.

While both seals have been retained, most people are only familiar with the Great Seal due to its corporate use. Great Seal 1904 version with image of the Raleigh but still retaining Latin inscription New Hampshire's state seal depicts the frigate and is surrounded by a laurel wreath with nine stars. The Raleigh is one of the first 13 warships sponsored by the Continental Congress for a new American navy, built in 1776, at Portsmouth. The seal is surrounded by a laurel wreath. The wreath is an ancient symbol of fame, honor, and victory. The nine stars within the wreath show that New Hampshire was the ninth state to join the Union. The water stands for the harbor of Portsmouth, and in the yellow- colored spit of land is granite, a strong igneous rock, representing both New Hampshire's rugged landscape and the sturdy character of her people.New Hampshire State Flag NH updated 1931\\"> In 1784, when the present state constitution became effective, the legislature revised the seal to depict a ship on stocks, with a rising sun in the background, to reflect Portsmouth having become a major shipbuilding center during the American Revolutionary War. Over the years, various items for shipment were also shown on the frontal dock in the seal.Zieber, Eugene: Heraldry in America. Published by the Department of Heraldry of the Bailey, Banks and Biddle Company. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1895. In 1919, New Hampshire Historical Society Director Otis G. Hammond, on the order of the Governor and Executive Council of New Hampshire, wrote a history of the state seal and flag. Hammond described how because the law governing the design of the seal was not very specific, when the dies wore down and had to be redesigned, the artists and sketchers had injected surprising details into the seal, such as rum barrels on the dock, sometimes including people standing beside them. In 1931, after Governor John G. Winant began his second term, he named a committee to produce a seal devoid of controversy. The General Court approved the committee's recommendations, later enacting a law codifying the official design of the state seal.New Hampshire Laws 1931 and Special Session 1930: New Hampshire Public Acts and Joint Resolutions of the Legislature of 1931 and Special Session of 1930, published by the Secretary of State (The Clarke Press, Manchester, New Hampshire, 1931) p. 44.

The Raleigh was built in Portsmouth in 1776, as one of the first 13 warships sponsored by the Continental Congress for a new American navy. The law declared the seal to be 2 inches in diameter bearing the new inscription, SEAL ‚Ä¢ OF ‚Ä¢ THE ‚Ä¢ STATE ‚Ä¢ OF ‚Ä¢ NEW HAMPSHIRE, replacing the Latin phrase Sigillum Reipublicae Neo Hantoniensis. The law also declared that only a granite boulder could be shown in the foreground. Flag The flag of New Hampshire from 1909 to 1931.

Alternate seal Colony Seal First independent seal On July 1, 1774, the First Provincial Congress met for the first time in Exeter, and subsequently they discarded every \\"Royal,\\" including the previous \\"George the III\\" seal. In preparation of the 1776 state constitution, the First Provincial Congress designed a seal measuring 1¬Ω inches in diameter and depicting an upright fish and pine tree on either side of a bundle of five arrows. The fish and pine represented the main trade of the colony and the five arrows represented each of the five counties. The seal bore the inscription: COLONY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE * VIS UNITA FORTIOR. The Latin motto vis unita fortior means \\"A united force (is) stronger.\\" The motto was meant to unify the counties and was never officially proclaimed, but was used during the American Revolution until 1784. While no official document prescribing the seal has been located, the first record of the seal is found on commissions issued to military officers by the Provincial Congress dated September 1, 1775. The last known use of the seal was on an act of the General Assembly on July 5, 1776. This seal continues to be published by the New Hampshire General Court on along with the modern seal, on the cover of copies of the State Constitution. First state seal, 1776 It is believed that the die used to affix the seal was designed during the summer of 1776. The first state seal was officially prescribed in an act passed September 12, 1776, two days after the resolution of statehood. The seal is still used by some members of the General Court, though there is no current statute governing its design or use. The size of the seal was increased to 1¬æ inches, and comprised a pine tree and an upright fish, on each side of a bundle of five arrows. The design reflected the state's then two major economic resources, and the arrows symbolized the strength of unity among the then five counties.

It was founded in the early 1950s during the apartheid era for black residents from Sophiatown.  History  Meadowlands has its origin with the introduction of the Natives Resettlement Act, Act No 19 of 1954 with its aim to move black people out of the centre of Johannesburg from multi-cultural areas such as Sophiatown and the Western Native Townships. The Urban Resettlement Board was created and the forced removals began on 10 February 1955 and would continue until the mid-sixties when most of the new township had been completed. Early residents were separated into new zones of the township based on their ethnic background and identifiable by the street names. The Johannesburg City Council, at the time controlled by the United Party, did not participate in the forced removals but did provide extra land in Diepkloof when space ran out in Meadowlands when black people from the suburbs of Martindale and Newclare needed areas to settle. The Johannesburg City Council did not control the area as it did with Soweto, but would be made to cover the cost of the relocations. By 1968, the Natives Resettlement Board had relocated 22,500 black families and 6,500 single persons in both Meadowlands and Diepkloof and would administer both areas as they had not yet been allocated to any white municipality. The forced move away from Sophiatown inspired Strike Vilakazi to compose Meadowlands. As with many other protest songs of this period, Meadowlands was made popular both within and outside South Africa by Miriam Makeba. By 1973, now known as Diepmeadow, the administration was taken over by the West Rand Administration Board (WRAB) and by 1978, a Diepmeadows Town Council was formed to run the two townships when they decided not to join Soweto Council.

Electricity is readily available to most places with only a few areas without electricity (including the Squatter camp in Drieziek 5). The town has a large multi-purpose community center. However, these improvements come with financial costs, which most of the citizens living in Orange Farm cannot afford. The ongoing privatization of Orange Farm has also drawn much criticism from social justice and human rights groups as they have pointed out that local small businesses keep dying. This can also be linked to the rising number of foreign owned shops in the area.

The disc included a 32-page booklet and was packaged in a plastic casing modeled after the PlayStation 2. Dreamless Dreamless.org was the site of a popular Internet forum, hosted by Joshua Davis from 1999 to 2001. Its minimal design, understated Web presence and hidden registration page all added to its intrigue, and for a while it was a gathering place for many graphic and web designers and programmers. \\"Photoshop Battles\\" were a popular activity among forum members, leading into the internet phenomenon now referred to as Photoshop tennis. The community of Dreamless traveled past the boundaries of the Internet ‚Äî impromptu local meetings (\\"riots\\", as Davis called them) were arranged for Dreamless users to meet face-to-face and exchange ideas. Threadless founders Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart met while active in the Dreamless community, and started Threadless after Jake won a T-shirt design competition run by Dreamless. One notorious forum on Dreamless was \\"08 - Meaningless and Shallow\\", a topical free-for-all which led to numerous flame wars, post floods and user-led XSS vandalism. After several \\"meltdowns\\" and member disputes, Davis closed Dreamless in July 2001. The link was reused to host Davis's Minecraft server. While private at the time of its creation, it is now open to everyone. The server was used mainly by the Deadmau5 mau5ville Minecraft community.

It is part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Lenasia is approximately 35 kilometres southwest of the Johannesburg Central Business District and 45 kilometres south of the Sandton Central Business District. History Early history Apartheid-era planners situated the group area for Johannesburg's Indians near the Lenz Military Base. It originates from 1958. According to Parnell and Pirie the foundations for Lenasia were laid in 1963.Parnell, Susan and Gordon Pirie (1991) Johannesburg. In Anthony Lemon (eds) Homes apart: South Africa‚Äôs segregated cities. Bloomington: Indiana University Press pp 129-145 The name \\"Lenasia\\" is thought to be a combination of the words \\"Lenz\\" and \\"Asia\\". The Lenz in question was one Captain Lenz who owned the original plot on which Lenasia is situated. Many of its early residents were forcibly removed under the Group Areas Act from Pageview and the portion of Vrededorp populated by non whites (jointly known as Fietas) and Fordsburg, areas close to the Johannesburg city centre, to Lenasia. As segregation grew it became the largest place where people of Indian extraction could legally live in the Transvaal Province. Geography Cityscape The township is large, and divided into extensions (Extensions 1-13) including a major suburb south of Lenasia, which is called Lenasia South and referred to as Daxina by the locals. A panoramic view of Lenasia as seen from the nearby N12 Freeway. On the left can be seen the town's most famous landmark - the Trade Route Mall (opened in April 2006) - whilst on the right is a townhouse complex (a common sight in contemporary Lenasia) called The Reeds. In the centre can be seen several of the residential areas of Lenasia with many minarets (representing the many mosques of the town) interspersed within it. Communities The younger generation tend to travel out of Lenasia to work for the big corporates. The growing population of Lenasia is a huge concern, as no additional land is being zoned for suburban development. Hence properties soar to exorbitant prices, making it more and more difficult for entry level income earners to afford to live there. Many of the younger generation are now beginning to move out of the suburb because of increasing home prices, major traffic congestion en route to the city, as well as wanting to live in a more multicultural environment. Although still a predominantly Indian area, Lenasia today is a more cosmopolitan and diverse suburb, providing a place to live for local coloured and African people, as well as recent immigrants and refugees. Climate Weather in Lenasia is typically 2-3 degrees cooler than central Johannesburg due to the town being situated within a valley. Economy Lenasia is now a vibrant and thriving community. The rapidly growing suburb has shopping malls (Trade Route Mall & Signet Terrace Shopping Centre), churches, mandirs, mosques, banks and various industrial and commercial sectors such as Kulfi Ice-cream and DB Sweets which are familiar household business names. It also boasts takeaways such as Akhalwayas known for its famous fish and chips and Delhi Delicious for its pies. It also boasts numerous other restaurants with well known franchises such as KFC,Wimpy, McDonald's and Burger King There are several prominent publications and newspapers based in Lenasia such as Lenasia Times, and the Rising Sun Newspaper. Four satellite radio stations, Radio Islam, Eastwave FM,Channel Islam International and Lenz Fm broadcast from Lenasia. Lenasia embraced the digital age when in 2002 a community website lenzinfo was launched, which keeps the community informed on happenings, sports events, religious and cultural activities and general information. Law and government Government It is located in Region G of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Politics The community of Lenasia played a prominent role in opposing the national tricameral elections held in 1984 and 1989 under the apartheid era National Party government. This was an attempt to create separate legislative assemblies in South Africa for Whites, Indians and Coloureds in order to entrench racial segregation and perpetuate the disenfranchisement of the African majority in South Africa. Lenasia also played a role in the creation and activities of the United Democratic Front (UDF), the mass democratic movement that opposed apartheid in the 1980s and early 1990s before the unbanning of the African National Congress. Many of Lenasia's residents played a prominent role in the UDF structures and the broader anti-apartheid movement. Some of these activists became senior political figures after the first national democratic elections in 1994. Parks and greenspace Rose Park in September 2012. Rose Park a popular venue amongst Lenasia residents for public events and for family relaxation on weekends. The park, which consists of aesthetically-pleasant rose bushes and a fountain, also has a special stimulation and play area that are specifically for children with disabilities. It also featured as a fan park during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Rose Park is also the venue for the popular parkrun', which takes place every Saturday at 8am. Sport Cricket Crescent Hawks and Cavalier Cats cricket match - Lenasia Cricket Stadium in September 2011.

In contrast to the selective breeding of livestock, arable crops, and horticultural flowers over the last few centuries, the breeding of trees, with the exception of fruit trees, is a relatively recent occurrence. Pinus radiata grafts in preparation for the establishment of a seed orchard in New Zealand Isolation bags for controlled pollination in a Pinus radiata seed orchard. A typical forest tree breeding program starts with selection of superior phenotypes (plus trees) in a natural or planted forest, often based on growth rate, tree form and site adaptation traits. This application of mass selection improves the mean performance of the forest. Offspring is obtained from selected trees and grown in test plantations that act as genetic trials. Based on such tests the best genotypes among the parents can be selected. Selected trees are typically multiplied by either seeds or grafting and seed orchards are established when the preferred output is improved seed. Alternatively, the best genotypes can be directly propagated by cuttings or in-vitro methods and used directly in clonal plantations. The first system is frequently used in pines and other conifers, while the second is typical in some broadleaves (poplars, eucalypts and others). The objectives of a tree breeding program range from yield improvement and adaptation to particular conditions, to pest- and disease-resistance, wood properties, etc. Currently, tree breeding is starting to take advantage of the fast development in plant genetics and genomics. Optimisation Tree breeders make efforts to get their operation efficient by optimising tree breeding. Scientists develop tools aimed at improvement of the efficiency of tree breeding programmes. Optimising can mean adapting strategies and methods to certain species, group of populations, structure of genetic variation and mode of inheritance of the important traits to obtain the highest benefit per unit of time. Optimising is usually carried out at the following levels: breeding strategy (appropriate intensity of breeding, breeding population structure and size, plan for maintenance of genetic diversity), breeding methods (mating type, testing and selection methods, testing population size and time) and deployment methods of the genetically improved material (seed orchardsLindgren, D. and Prescher, F. 2005. Optimal clone number for seed orchards with tested clones. Silvae Genetica 54: 80-92. and clonal forestry: genetic contribution, size). Computer simulators are frequently used: stochastic ‚Äì based on defined and random algorithms; and deterministic ‚Äì based on defined algorithms. Selection strategies have been compared for annual progress in long-term breeding at a given annual cost considering genetic gain, gene diversity, cost components, and time components. For Norway spruce it seems favourable to clone full sib families and then select based on clonal performanceDanuseviƒçius D & Lindgren D 2002. Efficiency of Selection Based on Phenotype, Clone and Progeny Testing in Long-term Breeding. Silvae Genetica 51:19-26. while for Scots pine a two- stage strategy seems best, first phenotypic pre-selection and then progeny- testing the selections.Danuseviƒçius D & Lindgren D 2002. Two-stage selection strategies in tree breeding considering gain, diversity, time and cost. Forest Genetics. 9:145-157. Tree improvement A genetically variable population and a method of selecting genetically superior individuals provide the basis for tree improvement by breeding. In essence, a tree improvement program sets out to isolate and evaluate the genetic component of variation in one or more characters of interest. In the simplest procedure, cycles of selection reduce the available population in a particular direction to enhance desirable traits, then breeding from selections to expand the population with improved characteristics. Breeding strategies vary with species and objectives, but all use mating designs to generate information and new material. Choice of a suitable breeding strategy and mating design is a key decision in any breeding program. Kiss (1986)Kiss, G.K. 1986. Genetic improvement of white and Engelmann spruce in British Columbia 1983‚Äì85. p. 191‚Äì193 in Yeatman, C.W.; Boyle, T.J.B. (Eds.), Proc. 20th Meet. Can. Tree Improv. Assoc.

The breeding program for white spruce initiated in 1986 by the Canadian Forestry Service in the Maritimes employed 2 kinds of mating: polycross, to test clones for general combining ability; and pair- mating, to generate material for second generation selections (Fowler et al. 1988).Fowler, D.P., Bonga, J.M., Park, Y.S., Simpson, J.D., and Smith, R.F. 1988.

Also, preliminary estimates derived from individual case studies indicated that first generational selection strategies for white spruce could increase merchantable productivity by approximately 20% at 45 years.

Early life His father, Stephen (), a nephew of John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, was of Romanian descent from his father's side; his mother was Barbara () Husz√°r.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 243 His autobiographical notes and correspondence throw light on his life. After having studied at the Chapter School of V√°rad (now Oradea, Romania) from 1505 to 1512, he became a page at the court of Ladislaus II, but shortly afterwards chose an ecclesiastical career, and was ordained a priest in 1516 or 1518.

University of Toronto Press, 2007, p. 92 he was appointed a canon of that chapter, later of Esztergom, and 1522 became Archdeacon of Kom√°rom. In 1526 he was made secretary to King Louis II; but was transferred to the service of Mary of Habsburg. After the battle of Moh√°cs, Olahus attached himself to the party of King Ferdinand I, but retained his position with the queen- dowager.http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Nicolaus_Ol%C3%A1h Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) High office In 1527 he was appointed Custos or head of the Chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, and accompanied the queen-dowager in 1530 to the Imperial Diet at Augsburg. When in 1531 she became Governor of the Netherlands, he went with her to what is today Belgium, where he remained (with a brief interruption in 1539) until his return to Hungary in 1542. In the following year he was made Royal Chancellor and Bishop of Agram (Zagreb) by King Ferdinand. In 1548 he became Bishop of Eger, and in 1553 Archbishop of Esztergom. As such, he crowned Maximilian King of Hungary, and performed the solemn obsequies (1563) over Ferdinand I. As Archbishop of Esztergom, Olahus' first care was to put order into the finances and property of the archdiocese. He enforced yet again the Jus Piseti, i.e. the right of supervision over the mint at Kremnica (K√∂rm√∂cb√°nya), for which surveillance the archdiocese enjoyed a large revenue. At his own expense, he redeemed the hypothecated provostship of Turiec (Tur√≥c), also the encumbered possessions of the Diocese of Nitra (Nyitra). As Archbishop of Esztergom, Olahus exercised a supervision over the Diocese of Eger, and (with the consent of the Holy See) administered the Archdiocese of Kalocsa, vacant for 20 years. After the capture of Esztergom by the Ottomans, the new archiepiscopal residence was moved to either Nagyszombat or Pozsony. Activities Olahus was particularly active in the Counter- Reformation; even before his elevation to the Archbishopric of Esztergom, he had been a very zealous opponent of the new Protestant teachings. As Primate of Hungary he threw himself with renewed energy into the great conflict, aiming especially at the purity of Catholic Faith, the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline, the reformation of the clergy, and the establishment of new schools. The mountain cities of Upper Hungary, in which the doctrines of the Reformation had made considerable progress, attracted his particular attention. He organized a visitation of the archdiocese, which he in great part conducted in person, besides convoking, with a similar intention, a number of diocesan synods. The first of these synods was held in 1560 at Nagyszombat; during its closing session he promulgated a code of dogmatic and moral instructions, intended for the clergy, published during that and the following year. In 1561 a provincial synod was held, likewise at Nagyszombat, to discuss the participation of the bishops of Hungary in the Council of Trent, which had just re-convened. While it is not certain whether Olahus took part in the Council, or if he promulgated in Hungary its decrees of 1562 and 1564, it is known that he followed its deliberations with close attention and put in practice some of its decisions. In 1563 Olahus submitted to the council a lengthy memorial, in which he urged the importance of dealing with the critical situation of the Hungarian Church and describing in strong language the efforts he had made to overcome the demoralization that had seized on the clergy. It was particularly through school reform and the proper instruction of youth that he hoped to offset the progress of the Reformation. He restored the Cathedral school at Esztergom, which had fallen into decay when the city had been captured by the Turks; he transferred it, however, to his archiepiscopal city of Nagyszombat and confided it to the Jesuits, whom he invited to Hungary in 1561, and who, through their preaching and spiritual ministry, profoundly influenced the religious life of the nation. Among the publications initiated by Olahus were the Breviarium Ecclesi√¶ Strigoniensis (1558), and the Ordo et Ritus Ecclesi√¶ Strigoniensis (1560). The revival of the custom of ringing the Angelus was due to him. As chancellor and confidant of Ferdinand I, Olahus possessed much political influence, which he exercised in the special interest of the Catholic religion. In 1562 he acted as Regent. He was a diligent writer. Writings * Hungaria et Attila * Nicolai Olahi metropolitae Strigoniensis Hungaria et Attila sive de originibus gentis regni Hungariae [...] emondato coniumctim editi.

TFN coordinates a worldwide network of \\"gifting\\" groups to divert reusable goods from landfills. The network provides a worldwide online registry, organizing the creation of local groups and forums for individuals and nonprofits to offer (or request) free items for reuse or recycling and to promote a gift economy. History TFN first began when its founder, Deron Beal, collaborated with RISE, a small nonprofit corporation that offers recycling services in the downtown area of Tucson, Arizona The team worked together to find local nonprofits that could potentially use their products, but it wasn't too successful. Hence, Beal created the first Freecycle email that enabled online users to interact with recycling. This marked the start of Freecycle officially. In February 2005, TFN accepted $130,000 from Waste Management to help build out the website and the network. Over time, the concept has spread to over 110 countries, with thousands of local groups and millions of members. The organization began as a collection of Yahoo! Groups linked from freecycle.org. It has become a web- community platform on freecycle.org for all groups, which are run by local volunteers. TFN encourages the formation of new groups, subject to approval by regional new-group approvers. Groups approved by TFN are listed on the website, can use the TFN name and logo, and are subject to rules which are enforced by a network of global and regional group outreach assistance. As of March 2009, all new groups had to join freecycle.org's new-group system, which provides Freecycle-specific tools for local volunteer moderators and gives TFN oversight of individual groups. As of 2015, all local groups are listed on freecycle.org. Membership Membership is completely free to all members, and everything posted on the website must be completely free, legal, and appropriate for everyone regardless of their age. Today, TFN is a global organization with over 4,000 local chapters. In fact, they passed the two- million-member mark in February 2006.The Freecycle Network Tops Two Million Member Mark Today!, Press release By February 2014, its membership was 6,880,991 in 5,120 groups worldwide. Controversies Trademark issues A notice of opposition was filed in federal court by FreecycleSunnyvale against the Freecycle Network in January 2006. An injunction was granted against Tim Oey in May 2006 for allegedly disparaging the TFN trademark. The injunction was stayed in July 2006 and dissolved by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September 2007. To defend its trademark in 2006, TFN pursued other free recycling groups who used the word \\"freecycle\\" or allegedly had \\"confusingly similar derivations thereof\\". Free-speech advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and 38 law professors, filed an amicus briefhttp://volokh.com/files/freecyclelemleybrief.pdf opposing a trademark-infringement lawsuit filed by TFN against Tim Oey. The opposition was based on the position that the lawsuit violated Oey's First Amendment rights. Other law professors, including Lawrence Lessig, and Jimmy Wales filed a second amicus briefhttp://volokh.com/files/freecyclepostbrief.pdf in support of Oey. On November 24, 2010, TFN lost its trademark claim to \\"Freecycle\\" and its logo in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Consuelo Mar√≠a Callahan wrote in her opinion, \\"Beal did not coin the word 'freecycle' and TFN is not the first organization to promote freecycling ... even ... viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to TFN ... [they] engaged in naked licensing and consequently abandoned the trademarks.\\" On September 25, 2012, TFN regained a registered trademark in the United States for Freecycle.org (registration number 4215094) from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state;=4803:o4aixl.2.4 TFN also received a registered-collective-membership trademark on that date (registration number 4215095).http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state;=4803:o4aixl.2.3 TFN maintains additional registered trademarks in the European Union, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Payments to founder Although TFN is primarily run by volunteers, Beal received a salary of $70,000 and \\"other compensation\\" of $12,811 in 2014.https://www.freecycle.org/files/form990/2015/form990-2015.pdf To determine Beal's salary, the TFN board \\"sees what is a reasonable pay level comparable to similar other local nonprofits and then we see how close we can get to achieving that amount, then the board votes on it; Deron Beal abstains.\\" The board consists of three people; one is Beal's wife, Jennifer Columbus. UK breakaway During 2009, there were conflicts between the UK's independent association of TFN moderators and the organization's founders over the UK-based TFN groups' lack of freedom to develop local initiatives and features and their treatment of volunteer group owners and moderators.UK Freecycle moderators break away from US network The Guardian, September 10, 2009 This resulted in the dismissal of at least 20 local group owners and moderators, who were replaced with new local TFN volunteers. Many owners of UK-based TFN groups formed a new independent association, Freegle.http://www.ilovefreegle.org/about/history.php Freegle History TFN continued in the UK, with both groups present in many areas.From Freegle and Freecycle websites, posted figures without independent checking or distinction between active and inactive members; for example 23 April 2012, Freegle Camden South (in London NW1), 4951 members; Freegle Kentish Town (in London NW1), 6734 members; Freecycle Camden South, 8663 members; Freecycle Kentish Town, 12805 members. There is no information on people belonging to both organisations, or long-standing but inactive members of the older organisation. In February 2015, TFN UK claimed 592 groups with 4,345,095 members.  Anarchist Analysis  Anarchist activist and author Peter Gelderloos has both praised and criticised the freecycle network for creating a decentralised sustainable miniature gift economy but not providing a program to criticise capitalism.

It was set to be utilized as a training field for teams participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup after being completely rebuilt and reopened in August 2008. Despite the relatively small capacity, it is regarded as one of the best playing surfaces in the country. History Rand Stadium was constructed between 1949 and 1951 at a cost of ¬£60,000 with a capacity of 15,000. Over time extensive renovations have been carried out, the first between 1964 and 1965 in which facilities were added and the second in 1976 that saw the installation of floodlighting. The stadium was adjudged to need serious improvements and it was decided that it would be demolished in 2006. The new Rand Stadium, managed by Stadium Management South Africa (SMSA), was rebuilt as an all-seater stadium and retained its old scoreboard for heritage purposes. The original capacity at Rand Stadium was 15,000 but a 2009 revamp in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup saw that capacity be extended to accommodate a maximum of 30, 000 fans. The refurbishment includes a roof that covers up to 3,000 fans. Even though Rand Stadium has a new-look with an all- seater stadium, the old scoreboard has been retained for heritage. Football Domestic There has been a number of cup finals at the venue, including the Kaizer Chiefs versus Hellenic Champion of Champions final in 1975 and the Wits University (now Bidvest Wits) winning the 1978 Mainstay Cup final against Kaizer Chiefs in the old National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), which was preceded by the National Soccer League (NSL). It was home to the original incarnation of local team Highlands Park. During the 2010‚Äì11 season it was home to local PSL team Kaizer Chiefs. but infrastructure issues and low attendance rates prompted them to move to the FNB Stadium.It is currently the training venue for arch-rivals Orlando Pirates. After it was temporarily closed down for renovations and revamped, Rand Stadium hosted the 2009 Nedbank Cup final between Moroka Swallows and the University of Pretoria. International The South Africa national football team (Bafana Bafana) use Rand Stadium as a training ground. The stadium has hosted two international fixtures. an African Cup of Nations qualifier against Mauritius in April 1993 which finished in a goalless draw.

For more than thirty years, he served as a wilderness guide in the lakes and forests of the Quetico-Superior country of northern Minnesota and northwestern Ontario. He was known honorifically as the Bourgeois ‚Äî a term the voyageurs of old used of their trusted leaders. Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois to Swedish Baptist parents, Olson grew up in northern Wisconsin where he developed his lifelong interest in the outdoors. They moved first to Sister Bay, then Prentice, then Ashland. In June 1921, Olson took his first canoe trip where he fell in love with the canoe country wilderness of northern Minnesota that would become the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (with his help).Minnesota Historical Society SIGURD F. OLSON: An Inventory of His Papers at the Minnesota Historical Society & Biographical Note - Chronology Retrieved 10/28/13 http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00316.xml His first article, an account of a canoe expedition, was published by the Milwaukee Journal on July 31, 1921. In August of that year, Olson married Elizabeth Dorothy Uhrenholdt, and the two spent their honeymoon on another canoe trip in the Boundary Waters. He worked as a canoe guide for J.C. Russell's outfitters on Fall Lake in Winton, Minnesota, before purchasing the business in 1929. Circa 1931 Olson ran Border Lakes Outfitters outside of Winton MN on the west end of fall lake serving the boundary waters area.My First Canoe Trip -1956 by John Dailey The Boundary Waters Journal magazine Winter 2018 issueA Guide's Tale by Gerald R.

Morse, Denis Coolican, Blair Fraser, Tony Lovink, Elliott Rodger, and Omond Solandt. Sigurd F. Olson Writing Shack interior, 106 E Wilson St, Ely, Minnesota After studying agriculture, botany, geology, and ecology at Northland College, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and the University of Illinois, Olson moved to Ely, Minnesota to teach biology at Ely Junior College (now Vermilion Community College). He later chaired the science department and served as dean. in 1947 he resigned from his teaching position and began writing full-time. He spent most of his life in the Ely area, working as a canoe guide during the summer months, teaching, and writing about the natural history, ecology, and outdoor life in and around the Boundary Waters. On August 27, 1971, a little over a year after the celebration of the first Earth Day, Northland College hosted its first environmental conference. Among those invited to address the two-day conference were Senator Gaylord Nelson and Sigurd Olson. The conference became \\"the instrument of origin of the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute,\\" as Robert Matteson, the founder of the institute, wrote. With energy to move in a new and exciting direction, and guided by the philosophies of Sigurd Olson, the institute opened its doors in spring of 1972, embarking on more than 30 years of serving Northland College and the Lake Superior region. In 1974, Olson earned the John Burroughs Medal, the highest honor in nature writing. He died on January 13, 1982, of a heart attack while snowshoeing near his home. He received a tribute from the US Senate on the 100th anniversary of his birth.http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/research/sigurd_olson/tribute.htm U.S. Senate Tribute to Sigurd Olson August 3, 1999 Page S10134.

Olson which was published in the late 1990s.https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/a-wilderness-within Preservation work Olson was influential in the protection of the Boundary Waters and helped draft the Wilderness Act of 1964, becoming vice-president of The Wilderness Society from 1963 to 1967 and president 1968 to 1971. He also helped establish Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota, Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and Point Reyes National Seashore in California. Sigurd also was a consultant to the Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall on wilderness and national park issues. After over 50 years of hard work, Sigurd reached his goal. Full wilderness status was granted to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by Jimmy Carter in 1978, four years before Sigurd died. His hard work was commemorated in many different ways, including in the naming of a central building of YMCA Camp Widjiwagan, located on nearby Burntside Lake. Olson was president of the National Parks Association and a member of its board of trustees.

The first and longest run was a progressive rock station and was usually, and affectionately, referred to as 'HFS. For many local residents, it was the first place to hear such bands as R.E.M., The Specials, Pixies, The Smiths, The Monochrome Set, The Cure, Echo & the Bunnymen, Stereolab, and New Order. \\"HFS\\" returned to the airwaves on August 1, 2011 on WWMX-HD2 (106.5 FM) and is translated on 104.9 (W285EJ) as of April 1, 2014. 1960s WHFS began broadcasting on November 11, 1961, on 102.3 FM in Bethesda, Maryland. It was the first station in the Washington, DC, area to broadcast in FM stereo, thus its call sign stood for Washington High Fidelity Stereo. It was originally located in a 20 √ó 20-foot space in the basement of the Bethesda Medical Building on Wisconsin Avenue with antenna on the roof. Its original format was classical, with jazz after 10 p.m. The first employee was Marlin R. Taylor who left within a few months. (Jesse) Alvin Jeweler was hired as his replacement. Using the on-air name Jay Allen, he remained with the station as the General Manager, Program Director and Audio Engineer, finally forming a group that eventually purchased the station. He left in 1976 and Jake Einstein was tapped as G.M. The original owners were considerably underfunded, and the station was sold in 1963. The station was initially moved to Norfolk Ave. in Bethesda and later to Woodmont Ave. All these locations are within a three-block area. When Jacob Einstein became general manager and part-owner in 1967, the station had a broadcast signal of 2,300 watts. > When Mr. Einstein became general manager of WHFS, the station had been on > the air for six years and was lucky to draw 800 listeners a night with its > format of pop, light classical and jazz. \\"Then a guy named Frank Richards > came in one day wearing cutoffs and a leather vest, played me a tape of rock > music from Los Angeles,\\" Mr. Einstein told The Washington Post in 1983. \\"We > were losing so much money that another couple of dollars couldn't hurt, > right? So we put him on. My God, the calls!

They went on under the name Spiritus Cheese (derived from a cheese > company in New York), and a new era was born. \\"It was Jake's vision that FM > radio and rock-and-roll were about to collide,\\" said Mr. Einstein's daughter > Rose, who briefly worked at WHFS. \\"He saw it as an all-night format that > would sustain a station.\\" Within months, WHFS was drawing an average nightly > audience of 32,700 listeners. Spiritus Cheese lasted just a year‚Äîsomeone > complained about a four-letter word in a Firesign Theatre skit broadcast on > the air‚Äîbut by then the station had found its niche. 1970s By the early 1970s, the station phased in broadcasting progressive music nearly all the time. Early on the station still played MOR from 7am until 4pm when Steve Walker started the rock-and-roll format. (Sundays were given to \\"sold airtime\\" foreign language programs). Sunday nights reverted to Steve \\"Pontious\\" who had come up to DC from a popular rock station in New Orleans. WHFS studios were now located in a second floor luxury condo at 4853 Cordell Avenue (\\"Broadcasting from high atop the Triangle Towers\\" was a phrase often heard over the air). The station was also conveniently located directly across the street from the Psyche Delly, a venue for live performances by bands playing the club circuit. Local radio legends (Don) Cerphe Colwell and Jonathan S. \\"Weasel\\" Gilbert began their careers when they joined WHFS in the early 1970s. Several part-time DJs such as American University student Mick Sussman handled the overnight and Sunday morning slots. In early 1971, the overnight show on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays was inherited by \\"littlejohn\\" (John Hendricks), who stayed until August 1972. His eclectic taste, brought from years of classical music training, mixed with his early upbringing on a farm exposed to country and bluegrass, and later the broad NYC music radio influence of the Pacifica Network, gave his audience blues, jazz, classical, bluegrass and slightly warped sense of humor that fit the late night slot and blended into a bizarre listening choice for late-night workers in the listening radius. Although it was against station policy, there were live interviews and performances. But he always apologized when caught. At that time, Fridays and Saturdays belonged to David and Damian Einstein, David being, also, the Program Director. The legendary Murray the K hosted the afternoon show in 1972, armed with his own advertising contracts essentially renting a slot for a short while with female partner Judy. In 1972, after Murray the K had left for WNBC (AM) in New York, Ty Ford left his Program Director and on-air positions WAYE to replace Judy. Ford remained at WHFS until 1975, as morning drive announcer, Chief Engineer and Production Director. Ford was quick to admit that Alvin Jeweler was the real engineering brains for WHFS-FM, but Jeweler had allowed his FCC license to expire, so Ford was listed as Chief Engineer. Ford went on to peak his radio career with eight and a half productive years at WBAL and 98Rock in Baltimore before leaving to start his own company. Many musicians, famous and not yet famous, traipsed across the street to do interviews and perform live at the station. Many cut WHFS-specific IDs. One classic example of a legal ID, done by The Persuasions, \\"WHFS, it's the station we like the best, we'll be rockin', we'll be rollin', on W - Hhhhh---F-Sssss - - - 102.3 - Bethesda.\\" That was one of many special IDs and live performances recorded by Ty Ford when he was there and in charge of Production. The enthusiastic and knowledgeable interviews by such deejays as \\"Weasel\\", who held down the drive-time afternoon weekday slot - about the time that bands setting up across the street were ready for a dinner break before a performance - provided details about the artists' experience, as well as providing plugs for the upcoming appearance. Weasel's obvious friendship with many of his guests elicited striking candor from them. During the 1970s, WHFS would broadcast music that other FM Rock stations normally overlooked, including cuts as long as 20 minutes. Artists like Frank Zappa, Yes, Genesis, Roxy Music and other non-commercial artists of the time were the normal format. If The Beatles were ever played, their more obscure tracks like Tomorrow Never Knows or Blue Jay Way were used instead of familiar tracks like Hey Jude or Lady Madonna. Once the station played all of Revolution 9. The station made a policy of never playing a \\"hit\\" and broke with precedent by leaving the playlists strictly up to the DJs. Once in a while the DJs would, as a joke, throw in a Top 40 hit just to throw the listeners off. Sometimes, late at night, the DJ might announce \\"and now we'll repeat that for those of you on drugs,\\" and immediately replay the last song. It furthered the careers of then-undiscovered stars Bruce Springsteen, George Thorogood and Emmylou Harris, who sometimes showed up at the studio. WHFS played the records of many local groups as well, including The Nighthawks, The Slickee Boys, Black Market Baby, The Diversions, Tru Fax & the Insaniacs, Bad Brains and Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band.\\" In addition to the station's progressive rock and alternative music, jazz, and even bluegrass was prominently featured on their format. One of the show's features was \\"Thor's Bluegrass\\" hosted by DJ Thor. Local bluegrass band The Seldom Scene would sometimes perform live from the station. Fans of the station came to expect certain \\"regular\\" features. Listeners were treated to Weasel playing \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" by the Ramones every Friday towards the end of the work day. At 5 p.m. on Friday Weasel would play (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) by the Beastie Boys and Bang the Drum All Day by Todd Rundgren (earlier in the 1980s, Weasel regularly would close his Friday shows with \\"She Makes Me Rock Too Much\\" by Ratso and Switchblade and \\"Here Comes the Weekend\\" by Dave Edmunds). Weasel also filled his playlist with requests like local DC near hit \\"Washingtron\\" by Tru Fax & the Insaniacs and \\"Yuppiedrone\\" by The Pheromones. The DJs answered the telephone themselves when requests were called in. WHFS made Root Boy Slim's \\"Christmas at K-Mart\\" a holiday standard. Weasel was the first to play The Diversions first single \\"Get Up\\" backed with \\"Lil Lovin' Baby\\" which was aired only moments after the record was hand delivered to the station upon its release in 1982. Among the station's more endearing traditions was the broadcasting of the entire \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\" suite that makes up the bulk of the first side of Frank Zappa's \\"Apostrophe\\" LP, when the Washington area would experience its first snowfall of the season. And every Thanksgiving, 'HFS listeners could count on Arlo Guthrie's \\"Alice's Restaurant Massacree\\" being played, usually by Bob \\"Here\\", all 18:20 of it. According to the Washington Post, the 1978 DJ lineup at WHFS was: Damian Einstein, Jonathan S. \\"Weasel\\" Gilbert, David Einstein, Bob \\"Here\\" Showacre, Diane Divola, and Tom Grooms. ( Cerphe Colwell left the station in 1976. In 2016, Cerphe, with co-author, Stephen Moore wrote a book \\"Cerphe's Up: A Musical Life With Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, Frank Zappa, Tom Waits, CSNY, And Many More\\" (Carrel Books) which documents his years at the station, along with profiles of many of the DJs, staff and the rock musicians he interviewed and featured on his radio shows. His book is now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Archive and Library). Don Grossinger did weekend late nights from 1976 through 1979 and, when Weasel moved to prime time, he took over overnights for two years, through 1981. He peppered his show with surprise rarities and unavailable tracks. Diane Divola came to the station in 1976 and took over the morning show (6 a.m. to 10 a.m.) and held that spot until 1984. Adele Abrams held weekend slots from 1974 to 1988 (and held a full-time shift for nearly two years following Damian's accident). She and Weasel also hosted a live show featuring local band performances called \\"Take One,\\" which broadcast from the Sounds Reasonable studio in Washington, DC, during the late 1970s. Suzanne Gordon was the progressive format's first news director, hosting five \\"News of the Universe\\" segments, and various public affairs features, daily from 1975 to 1977. Susan Desmarais hosted the overnight weekend slots from 1980 to 1983, and went on to 99.1, hosting Saturday and Sunday afternoons. She eventually hosted the 9pm-1am slot until 1986. 1980s and 1990s In early 1983 Jacob Einstein sold the station to the owners of WTOP (AM) for $2 million which Einstein then used to purchase WNAV AM and WLOM FM Annapolis, Maryland. Eventually, WNAV-AM was sold and passed through several owners (including being resold to Einstein in the mid-1990s) until WNAV was ultimately sold to Pat Sajak, the game-show host, in 1998. Einstein took the 'HFS call letters with him and WLOM-FM 99.1 became WHFS (FM) in Autumn 1983. Not only did 99.1 operate with higher power than the 102.3 facility, but its transmitter was located halfway between Washington and Baltimore, providing a strong signal to both markets. Eventually Einstein's group sold WHFS. When the station switched formats, it was located at the Infinity Broadcasting Center in Lanham, Maryland. The 102.3 frequency is now occupied by an Urban AC station in Washington, using the call letters WMMJ and nicknamed \\"Majic 102.3\\". A daily topical humor \\"news\\" show, The Daily FeedThe Daily Feed by John Dryden of DC Audio, aired for much of the 1980s on WHFS. It featured the sarcastic \\"Max Nobny\\" exchanging wit with straightman and nominal narrator, the Baltimore- accented \\"Frank Benlin\\", discussing current issues and using classic passion plays such as Star Trek parodies (during the Gulf shipping crisis of the mid-1990s when the U.S. reflagged Middle Eastern tankers) as a comedy vehicle. During Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug case, a faux‚ÄìWashington, D.C. tourism promo by the Feed referred to the mayor for life, adding that he \\"is featured on a totally hidden federal video program\\". Sunday broadcasts featured paid foreign language/culture specialty shows in the morning. In the afternoon in the 1980s, Tom Terrell would host Sunday Reggae Splashdown. Some of the most iconic WHFS on-air staff included: David Einstein, Damian Einstein, Bob \\"Here\\" Showacre, Weasel, Dave Issing, Milo, Tom Terrell, Neci Crowder, Bob Waugh, Rob Timm, Kathryn Lauren, Pat Ferrise, Johnny Riggs, and Gina Crash. Since 1990, WHFS has hosted an event called the HFStival, an annual (sometimes semi-annual) day-long (sometimes two-day-long) outdoor concert. The concert, often held at Washington's RFK Stadium, features a variety of local and national acts; for example, the 2004 lineup included The Cure, Jay-Z, Modest Mouse, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Cypress Hill. Robert Benjamin, Bob Waugh and Bill Glasser took the HFStival from a small yearly concert at Lake Fairfax in Reston, Virginia, to a large festival in Washington, D.C. that was headlined by major acts and was surrounded by culturally significant booths, games, food, and rides, as well as an outdoor second stage. In 1999, there was an additional HFStival, headlined by Red Hot Chili Peppers, held at the then-new stadium of the Baltimore Ravens. In the mid-1990s, Liberty Broadcasting published a quarterly magazine titled WHFS Press that was mailed to listeners and available in local music outlets.WHFS Press, Liberty Broadcasting, Winter 1994 2000 to 2005 Though becoming famous as a cutting-edge station playing the latest underground music (and often beating the mainstream to the punch by months and even years), the station, under Infinity Broadcasting's ownership, became the local modern alternative station in the mid-1990s. In this period, WHFS featured a specialty show called \\"Now Hear This\\", hosted by Dave Marsh, that highlighted indie and local music. Though in the few years before the infamous 2005 format switch the station did begin to combine more underground programming with its modern rock format, it never fully reverted to its prior all-indie status. In 1999, WHFS released a New Music New Video Compilation Volume 1 on VHS that was distributed free at Washington area Tower Records outlets. It featured tracks by Cyclefly, Fuel, Fastball, Elliott Smith, Kid Rock, Eve 6, 3 Colours Red, Puya, and Joydrop. No longer playing rather obscure progressive rock, nor the classic and hard rock of its Baltimore competitor WIYY, HFS was now formatted more towards a younger set of fans who were more apt to listen to Green Day and Fuel than less mainstream artists such as Fugazi or Lou Reed. The station played much of the alternative hits that were touted by the mainstream press and MTV, turning off many old-school HFS listeners, but in turn gaining many listeners in the 18-24 age demographic. Abrupt format switch to tropical Latin music At noon on January 12, 2005, 99.1 WHFS was switched to a Tropical Latin music format. Its call letters were soon changed to WZLL for a few days, and then again to WLZL, and the station was rebranded as \\"El Zol 99.1 FM\\". Although a format change had been rumored to some extent for years-- due to slipping ratings (22nd) in its primary market of Washington (although its ratings in Baltimore remained high)--the switch was not publicized beforehand and took many long-time fans, and even most of the station's staff, by surprise. Most of the station's staff were not told of the change until less than an hour before it happened, and new management presided in the air studio as the former format was playing its last few songs. The last song played on the station before the format change was \\"Last Goodbye\\" by Jeff Buckley. Though nearly always met with harsh criticism, such abrupt format changes are a common practice in the radio industry to prevent situations where soon-to-be-former airstaff and listeners vent their anger on-air at a switch towards management, often with strong language. AOL, which had a partnership with Infinity Broadcasting and recognized that many people would miss the old WHFS format, quickly launched an internet-only streaming radio station with a playlist much like that of WHFS. Live 105.7: a new WHFS Infinity Broadcasting saw an unexpected public reaction to their decision to change the format of 99.1 FM in Washington. The story was covered by local TV stations for many days afterwards, and mentioned nationally by The Washington Post, The Howard Stern Show, and The Today Show. The corporate offices of Infinity Broadcasting in New York City were flooded with phone calls and e-mails from irate listeners. An online petition protesting the format change gathered tens of thousands of signatures in only a few days. Media attention was attracted by a public protest in downtown Washington, outside a skate shop where WHFS maintained a remote storefront studio in its last few months. WHFS' main competitor, DC101, paid tribute to the station, airing many memories of WHFS from its DJs and listeners. Infinity Broadcasting responded by resurrecting the WHFS format on nights and weekends on Live 105.7 in Baltimore, Maryland, beginning at 7 p.m. on January 21, 2005 with former WHFS afternoon DJ Tim Virgin. The station rebranded itself as \\"The Legendary HFS, Live on 105.7\\", Infinity Broadcasting moved the WHFS call letters to the station days later. Move to HD 105.7 HFS ceased broadcasting mainstream music on February 1, 2007 immediately before KMS on HFS premiered, yet retained the WHFS call letters traditionally associated with the music the station used to broadcast. During this period the WHFS format was moved to HD radio as WHFS 105.7-HD2 and was known as HFS2. End of 105.7 On November 3, 2008, WHFS flipped to a sports talk format, similar to that of sister station WFAN in New York City. Along with the format change came a new call sign: WJZ-FM. On November 10, 2008, the WHFS call sign was moved to 1580 AM which dropped its long-time call letters WPGC. The format was changed to talk, with programs hosted by Michael Smerconish (from sister station WPHT), Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Lou Dobbs, and Laura Schlessinger. The station dropped the calls on December 1, 2011, becoming WNEW. The WHFS calls were then moved to an FM station in West Palm Beach, Florida, otherwise branded as \\"B-106.3\\" (and which previously housed the WNEW calls for several years prior). Return to DC on 94.7 HD 2 On June 10, 2009, the WHFS alternative format was relaunched as HFS2 once again, now located at WIAD 94.7-HD2 in Bethesda, Maryland and serving the Washington, DC area. On January 1, 2012, HFS was removed and replaced with WNEW simulcast. Added to Baltimore's WWMX-HD2 and translator 97.5 & 104.9 \\"HFS\\" was added to Baltimore airwaves at noon on Monday, August 1, 2011. The station was broadcast via two channels: WWMX 106.5-HD2 and W248AO 97.5. W248AO was moved to The Candelabra tower in Baltimore, and the power was increased to 250W. On April 1, 2014, the 97.5 feed was moved to a new translator at 104.9 W285EJ in White Marsh as a result of an agreement with Hope Christian; the power is now 10W. Current status of the WHFS call sign In order to preserve the rights to the WHFS branding and call sign, CBS Radio was required to \\"park\\" the call signs on another active station. Thus, CBS moved the WHFS call signs first to a co-owned FM station in West Palm Beach (and as noted earlier, said station - which was known as \\"B-106.3\\"‚Äîalso previously housed the \\"WNEW\\" call sign for identical purposes). When that station, along with CBS Radio's entire West Palm Beach cluster of stations, was divested to separate ownership in July 2012, it assumed the WUUB call sign. CBS then moved the WHFS calls to an FM station and an AM station in Tampa, Florida, which both feature a sports talk format. Following CBS' multi- market station trade with Beasley Broadcasting, which included CBS Radio's Tampa Bay cluster and the current WHFS (AM) and WHFS-FM, neither of which had their call signs altered, the rights to the WHFS call sign were thus passed over to Beasley. However, on February 4, 2015, after WHFS-FM switched to a rock format, the call sign became WBRN-FM. The station is now WPBB.

H-6. (the Act) is a statute passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1977 with the express goal of extending the law to ensure equal opportunity to individuals who may be victims of discriminatory practices based on a set of prohibited grounds. The prohibited grounds currently are: race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability, and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.Canadian Human Rights Act, s. 3(1).  Application  The Act applies throughout Canada, but only to federally regulated activities; each province and territory has its own anti-discrimination law that applies to activities that are not federally regulated. The Canadian Human Rights Act created the Canadian Human Rights Commission that investigates claims of discrimination as well as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to judge the cases. Before a case can be brought to the Tribunal it must go through several stages of investigation and remediation by the Commission. After this process has been completed, if the parties are not satisfied, the case will go to the tribunal. If a complainant can show a valid case of discrimination the defendant can rebuke it by showing that their practice was for a justified reason. The process is generally known as the \\"Meiorin test\\" which is similar to the Oakes test justification in a Charter challenge. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's determination that the Indian Act did not violate the Canadian Human Rights Act was reasonable due to judicial deference.. Specific provisions Gender identity and expression In 2016, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (C-16) in the House of Commons of Canada, to add and include \\"gender identity or expression\\" to the legislation. The bill passed the Commons on November 18, 2016, and the Senate on June 15, 2017. It received royal assent on June 19, 2017. The law went into effect immediately.  Hate messages  The Canadian Human Rights Act formerly had a provision, section 13, dealing with communication of hate messages.

The HardSID cards are based on the MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device) chip which was popularised and immortalized by the Commodore 64 home computer. It was the third non-Commodore SID-based device to enter market (the first was the SID Symphony from Creative Micro Designs and the second was the SidStation MIDI synthesiser, by Elektron). HardSID's major advantage over SidStation (apart from the fact that the SidStation has been sold out long since, with only few used pieces surfacing now and then) is that it is a simple hardware interface to a SID chip, making it far more suitable for emulator use, SID music players and even direct programming - SidStation only responds to MIDI information and requires music events to be converted to MIDI and back. The original HardSID (1999) was a card for the ISA bus (instantaneously anachronizing the item), containing a slot for one SID chip. From the beginning, HardSID has supported both the 6581 and the 8580 models of SID, including all revisions. The ISA model was subsequently replaced with a version for the PCI bus. As well as a standard 1-SID version, they launched the HardSID Quattro, which includes slots for four SID chips and a cooling fan. A USB line of HardSID products was introduced with two new models; the HardSID 4U, a USB device with sockets for four SID chips, and the HardSID 4U Studio Edition with improved electrical isolation and screening to reduce noise in the signal. As of May 2010, there are three USB HardSID devices available: the HardSID Uno with one SID chip, the HardSID UPlay with two SID chips, and the already known HardSID 4U Studio Edition with four SID chips. HardSID cards are supported by most modern SID music playing applications, including sidplay and ACID64 Player and some trackers such as GoatTracker. The ISA cards have official device drivers for Microsoft Windows, and the PCI ones for Mac OS X as well as Windows. The PCI Windows drivers support up to 32-bit Windows XP, and there is no 64-bit drivers or Windows Vista/7 support at all. Unofficial drivers are available for Linux. The HardSID USB devices are shipped with Windows drivers for XP/Vista/7 only. Mac OS X support was already worked on but dropped in May 2009, officially due to \\"lack of/minimal interest\\" (source: official, now closed Yahoo group) before any (beta) drivers were released. There are also no Linux drivers available. Separate MIDI drivers, which allowed any MIDI-capable instrument or sequencer program to drive the card, were available for both the ISA and PCI versions of the HardSID. The HardSID 4U unit has dedicated on- board CPU power, as opposed to the earlier HardSID units. This makes the 4U able to play SID-files with digi-contents at full speed and quality, without eating up the host computer's CPU power. The older revisions depended on the player software's emulation to accomplish this, due to the lack of an on-board CPU or memory buffer. The result was virtually always a very high CPU load when playing digi-tunes.

Housecleaning Broom, sponge and duster Part of the housework of a London housewife, 1941 Housekeeping includes housecleaning, that is, disposing of rubbish, cleaning dirty surfaces, dusting and vacuuming. It may also involve some outdoor chores, such as removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows and sweeping doormats. The term housecleaning is often used also figuratively in politics and business, for the removal of unwanted personnel, methods or policies in an effort at reform or improvement.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language Retrieved 2011-01-23 Housecleaning is done to make the home look and smell better and to make it safer and easier to live in. Without housecleaning, lime scale can build up on taps, mold grows in wet areas, smudges appear on glass surfaces, dust forms on surfaces, bacterial action makes the garbage disposal and toilet smell and cobwebs accumulate. Tools used in housecleaning include vacuums, brooms, mops and sponges, together with cleaning products such as detergents, disinfectants and bleach. Removal of litter Disposal of rubbish is an important aspect of house cleaning. Plastic bags are designed and manufactured specifically for the collection of litter. Many are sized to fit common waste baskets and trash cans. Paper bags are made to carry aluminum cans, glass jars and other things, although most people use plastic bins for glass since it could break and tear through the bag. Recycling of some kinds of litter is possible.Dellutri, Laura. 2005. Speed Cleaning 101. Meredith Books, Des Moines, Iowa. Dusting Some dusting tools Over time dust accumulates on household surfaces. As well as making the surfaces dirty, when dust is disturbed it can become suspended in the air, causing sneezing and breathing trouble. It can also transfer from furniture to clothing, making it unclean. Various tools have been invented for dust removal: feather dusters, cotton and polyester dust cloths, furniture spray, disposable paper \\"dust cloths\\", dust mops for smooth floors and vacuum cleaners. Vacuum cleaners often have a variety of tools to enable them to remove dirt not just from carpets and rugs, but also from hard surfaces and upholstery.Kennedy, Rose. 2006. 10-Minute Housekeeping.

Clean It Fast, Clean It Right. Emmaus, PA: Rodale To ensure safety, protective apparel including rubber gloves, face covers, and protective eyewear are also sometimes used when dealing with chemical cleaning products. Yard A home's yard and exterior are sometimes subject to cleaning. Exterior cleaning also occurs for safety, upkeep and usefulness. It includes removal of paper litter and grass growing in sidewalk cracks. Social significance While housekeeping can be seen as an objective activity that can be done by either men or women, some people have argued that housekeeping is a site of historical oppression and gender division between men and women. Housekeeping also has a role in maintaining certain parts of the capitalist economy, including the division of home and work life, as well as industries that sell chemicals and household goods. A survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2014 came to the result that approximately 43 percent of men did food preparation or cleanup on any given day, compared with approximately 70 percent of women. In addition, 20 percent of men did housekeeping chores (including cleaning and laundry) on any given day, compared to approximately 50 percent of women. The Swedish practice of d√∂st√§dning (literally \\"death cleaning\\") is a simple living ethic and aesthetic which, while being primarily focused on not burdening those who survive you with your possessions, is also used as a permanent form of householding organization which secondarily focuses on keeping only those possessions which have strong value.

He developed a horse drawn monorail system invented by Henry Robinson Palmer in 1821 further. The most famous Lartigue railway was the Listowel and Ballybunion Railway in Ireland. Another line, long, was built in 1895 between Feurs and Panissi√®res, in the French d√©partement of Loire. Lartigue had seen camels in Algeria carrying heavy loads balanced in panniers on their backs. This inspired him to design a new type of railway. Instead of the conventional two parallel rails on the ground, it had a single rail sitting above the sand and held at waist height on A-shaped trestles. The carriages sat astride the trestles like panniers. By 1881 Lartigue had built a monorail to transport esparto grass across the Algerian desert, with mules pulling trains of panniers that straddled the elevated rail. However the Lartigue system as built was not truly a monorail, since it was necessary to add two further rails, one on each side, lower down the A frames. These did not carry any weight, but unpowered stabilising wheels fitted to all the engines and wagons contacted these extra rails to prevent the vehicles from overbalancing. Listowel and Ballybunion Railway Junction on Listowel and Ballybunion Railway Ballybunion Turntable at Listowel Passing loop at Lisselton This was a monorail built on the Lartigue principle in County Kerry in Ireland. It linked Ballybunion with the North Kerry line at Listowel. It had one intermediate station and a passing loop at Lisselton. The line ran beside the main Listowel/Ballybunion road (R553). It officially opened on 29 February 1888, public services beginning on 5 March.Newham A.T. The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway Locomotive Paper 33 1998 Publisher Oakwood Press The track was prefabricated and easily erected, and the capital cost was ¬£33,000, far lower than a conventional railway. No baronial guarantees were sought. However, the system had significant operating drawbacks. Loads had to be evenly balanced. If a farmer wanted to send a cow to market, he would have to send two calves to balance it, which would travel back on opposite sides of the same freight wagon, thereby balancing each other. Another problem with using the Lartigue system in populated areas was that, due to the track's design, it was not possible to build conventional level crossings. In order for a road to cross the track, a kind of double- sided drawbridge had to be constructed, which required an attendant to operate it. Where farmers' tracks crossed the line there were level crossings based on the principle of a turntable. These were locked and the farmer in question provided with a key. Once unlocked, the track could be swivelled to one side to allow the crossing to be used. Both the swivelling and drawbridge type crossings were automatically linked to signals, which stopped any approaching trains; road traffic was always given priority under this system. Passengers could not pass from one side of a carriage to another while in motion. A kind of footbridge was built into one end of some of the passenger coaches, while at least one such bridge was carried on a separate wagon. This allowed passengers to cross from one side of the train to the other when stopped at a station. Conventional railway points could not be used, so a similar function was fulfilled by a large number of curved movable pieces of track which, when rotated one way, would connect the main and one other track. When turned end- for-end, the curve went in the opposite direction, and so connected the main and a different track. The devices could not be called turntables because they could only be moved when there was no rolling stock on them. There was, however, a turntable at each terminus. The three locomotives were of the 0-3-0 type, constructed by the Hunslet Engine Company. They were specially built with two boilers to balance on the track, and consequently two fireboxes, one of which had to be stoked by the driver. They were also fitted with powered tenders for auxiliary use on hills. The tender wheels were driven by two cylinders via spur gears. Two small chimneys were fitted to each tender to discharge the exhaust steam from these cylinders. A smaller engine, nicknamed the \\"coffee pot\\", was used in the construction of the railway, having been used previously on a demonstration line at Tothill Fields in London. It can be seen on an early photo of 1888. The track, installations and rolling stock were damaged during the Irish Civil War of 1922/23, but services continued. However, the failure to include the railway in the Great Southern Railways, the company created by the Irish Government to run the railways in the Irish Free State, left the financially struggling operation no choice but to close.Newham A.T. The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway Locomotive Paper 33 1998 Publisher Oakwood Press The last train ran on 14 October 1924 and everything was scrapped, except a short section of the track.  Accidents  On 29 September 1889, a passenger train was derailed near Galey bridge, probably as a result of sabotage to the line. Several bolts were found to have been removed from the track and discarded some distance away. Fortunately no- one was injured.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BoT_GaleyBridge1889.pdf On 28 November 1907, a double-headed train on a busy race day collided with some sleepers on a trestle and derailed. Restoration The new Lartigue locomotive In 2003 the Lartigue Monorailway Restoration Committee, a voluntary organisation from Listowel, opened a section of Lartigue monorail on the trackbed of the former North Kerry line in Listowel. Visitors to the site Lartigue Monorail and Museum can take a demonstration monorail trip and learn about the history of the Lartigue Monorail. The line is worked by a diesel locomotive built to resemble the original 0-3-0 steam engines. The locomotive and its train of replica coaches were built by Alan Keef Ltd. Other Examples In the northern Mojave desert of California, the Epsom Salts Monorail was built in 1924. It ran for from a connection on the Trona Railway, eastward to harvest epsomite deposits in the Owlshead Mountains. This non- passenger monorail achieved gradients of more than ten percent. It only operated until June 1926, when the mineral deposits become uneconomic, and was dismantled for scrap in the late 1930s.

The medal recognizes those service members who performed garrison occupation duty in the United States Protectorate over Cuba, following the close of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Criteria The Army of Cuban Occupation Medal was established by War Department General Order 40, in June 1915. To be awarded the Army of Cuban Occupation Medal, a service member must have served within the geographical borders of Cuba between the dates of 18 July 1898 and 20 May 1902. The medal was primarily awarded to members of the United States Army, but was available to other branches of service under certain circumstances. The first Army of Cuban Occupation Medal was awarded to Major General Leonard Wood. The Army of Cuban Pacification Medal was a similarly named decoration, but was awarded for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Cuba seven years after the close of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Appearance The medal is a circular bronze disc 1 3/8 inches in diameter. On the obverse is the Coat of Arms of Cuba. Around the edge is the inscription ARMY OF OCCUPATION MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF CUBA. The dates 1898 and 1902 are on either side of the Phrygian cap at the top of the coat of arms. The reverse depicts a spread winged eagle perched upon a trophy of a cannon, rifles, war flags, an Indian shield, quiver of arrows and three spears, a Cuban machete and Sulu kris. Below the trophy are the words FOR SERVICE. Above the eagle are the words arched around the edge UNITED STATES ARMY. In the lower half at the edge are thirteen five-pointed stars.

Simon studied engraving under Nicholas Briot, and about 1635 received a post in connection with the Royal Mint. In 1645 he was appointed by the parliament joint chief engraver along with Edward Wade, and, having executed the great seal of the Commonwealth and dies for the coinage, he was promoted to be chief engraver to the mint and seals. He produced several fine portrait medals of Oliver Cromwell, one of which is copied from a miniature by Samuel Cooper. After the Restoration Simon was appointed engraver of the king's seals. On the occasion of his contest with the brothers John, Joseph and Philip Roettiers, who were employed by the mint in 1662, Simon produced his celebrated crown of Charles II, on the margin of which he engraved a petition to the king. This is usually considered his masterpiece. He is believed to have died of the plague in London in 1665. A volume of The Medals, Coins, Great Seals and other Works of Thomas Simon, engraved and described by George Vertue, was published in 1753. He worked together with his brother Abraham Simon.

Very little is known of Sempill's life. He appears to have spent some time in Paris. He was probably a soldier, and must have held some office at the Scottish court, as his name appears in the Lord Treasurer's books in February 1567 ‚Äì 1568, and his writings show him to have had an intimate knowledge of court affairs. He was a bitter opponent of Queen Mary and of the Catholic Church. Sempill was present at the siege of Leith (1559-1560), was in Paris in 1572, but fled the country after the massacre of St Bartholomew. He was probably present at the siege of Edinburgh Castle serving with the army of James Douglas, Earl of Morton. His chief works are: *The Ballat maid vpoun Margret Fleming callit the Flemyng bark *The defence of Crissell Sande-landis *The Claith Merchant or Ballat of Jonet Reid, ane Violet and Ane Quhyt, all three in the Bannatyne manuscript They are characterized by extreme coarseness, and are probably among his earlier works. His chief political poems are: *The Regentis Tragedie, a broadside of 1570 *The Sege of the Castel of Edinburgh (1573), interesting from an historical point of view *Ane Complaint vpon fortoun ... (1581) *The Legend of the Bischop of St Androis Lyfe callit Mr Patrik Adamsone (1583) Some of his poems and ballads were intended to advance the cause of the King's side during the Marian civil war. Anonymous printed ballads such as The tressoun of Dumbertane, Robert Lekprevik, Edinburgh (1570), have been attributed to Sempill.

Her wet nurse was a married gentlewoman from Hayes named Cecily Burbage. Elizabeth spent much of her short life at the royal nursery of Eltham Palace, Kent, with her older siblings Margaret (later Queen of Scotland) and Henry (the future Henry VIII of England). Elizabeth's oldest brother, Arthur, was heir to the English throne and so lived separately in his own household. Just before Elizabeth's death, her father proposed a marriage alliance between Elizabeth and the French prince Francis, who later became king as Francis I of France. Death Elizabeth died at Eltham Palace in Kent on 14 September 1495 at the age of three years and two months. She was brought from Eltham in state and buried on the north side of the Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey on 27 September. Elizabeth was the first of four of Henry and Elizabeth's children to die prematurely and they were greatly affected. The large sum of ¬£318 (¬£155,479.74 in today's money) was spent on her funeral, and Henry erected a small tomb to his daughter in the abbey made from Purbeck and black marble.

It is one of ten theological institutions affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). History Columbia Theological Seminary was founded in 1828 in Lexington, Georgia, by several Presbyterian ministers. In 1830, the seminary was moved to Columbia, South Carolina (taking its name at that location), and in 1927, to its current location in suburban Atlanta. During the American Civil War, the seminary became affiliated with the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America, renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States after the war. The school became a battle ground in the debate over the theory of evolution in the PCUS during the 1880s, due to the controversial views of James Woodrow, an uncle of President Woodrow Wilson and seminary science professor, who aligned with evolution, a controversy which led to the school not operating during the 1887-1888 academic year. In 1830, Columbia, South Carolina, became the first permanent location of the seminary. The school became popularly known as Columbia Theological Seminary, and the name was formally accepted in 1925. The decade of the 1920s saw a shift in population throughout the Southeast. Atlanta was becoming a commercial and industrial center and growing rapidly in its cultural and educational opportunities. Between 1925 and 1930, President Richard T. Gillespie provided leadership that led to the development of the present facilities on a fifty- seven-acre tract in Decatur, Georgia. Because the early years in Decatur were difficult, the future of the institution became uncertain. Columbia, however, experienced substantial growth under the leadership of Dr. J. McDowell Richards, who was elected president in 1932 and led the seminary for almost four decades. Columbia was one of the several PCUS seminaries that joined the PC (U.S.A.) following the 1983 PCUS and United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. merger.

The flowers are yellow (white in E. albiflora and E. pinnatifida), and among the first to appear in spring, as early as January in mild climates, though later where winter snowpack persists; they are frost-tolerant and readily survive fresh snow cover unharmed. The leaves only expand fully when the flowers are nearly finished; they are peltate, 5‚Äì8 cm diameter, with several notches, and only last for 2‚Äì3 months before dying down during the late spring. Species in this genus are spring ephemerals, growing on forest floors and using the sunshine available below the canopy of deciduous trees before the leaves come out; the leaves die off when the shade from tree canopies becomes dense, or, in dry areas, when summer drought reduces water availability.

She composed over 150 works for piano, 50 songs, other instrumental and orchestral works and performed as a concert pianist with eminent conductors including Sir Malcolm Sargent, Constant Lambert, Georg Schn√©evoigt, Sir Bernard Heinze and Geoffrey Simon. She also had books of poetry published, and wrote an autobiography. Life Hyde was born in Adelaide in 1913. Music was an important part of her family life: her mother, Muriel, played and taught piano; her aunt, Clarice Gmeiner, played violin, viola and harp with the South Australian Symphony Orchestra; and her younger sister, Pauline, played violin and sang.Johnson (2004) Her early music lessons were provided by her mother, but in 1925 she won a scholarship to attend the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide. After graduating with her Bachelor of Music degree in 1931, she won an Elder Scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London, which she attended from 1932 to 1935. Her teachers were R. O. Morris and Gordon Jacob for composition, and Howard Hadley and Arthur Benjamin for piano. She won several composition prizes while at the College, including the Cobbett Prize. However, during this time she also suffered a nervous collapse, and her mother went to England to be with her. Hyde gave her first London recital at Holland Park in 1933, and in 1934 her Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat minor was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Leslie Heward with her as soloist.Telegraph, 17 February 2005 In 1935, she performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 under Malcolm Sargent, and her own Piano Concerto No. 2 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Constant Lambert.Hyde (1991) She saw many of the great musicians of the time, including Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Yehudi Menuhin and Elisabeth Schumann. She returned to Adelaide in 1936 and soon after moved to Sydney, where she worked for several decades as a composer, recitalist, teacher, examiner and lecturer. It was here that she also met her husband, Marcus Edwards, whom she married in 1939 and with whom she had two children, Christine (1950) and Robert (1951). During the war years, while her husband was interned as a German prisoner of war after being captured on Crete, she taught in Adelaide, returning to Sydney at the end of hostilities. Her monumental Sonata in G minor for piano (1941‚Äì44) is very much a reflection of the war years. Major works from the post-war period included the Happy Occasion Overture (1957), the Kelso Overture (1959), Sonata for Clarinet (1949), String Quartet in E minor (1952), Sonata for Flute (1962) and her two trios for winds and piano (1948, 1952). One of her most famous works is the piano piece Valley of Rocks (1975). Her work for the Australian Music Examinations Board (AMEB) spanned the years 1945‚Äì82, including her valuable contribution on the Advisory Board for New South Wales. Her activities included examining, mentoring, demonstrations and workshops, setting/reviewing/marking exam papers, advising on syllabus content. She also wrote educational materials ‚Äì books of sight- reading, examples of forms, aural tests for all grades, tutor books including one for adult beginners. Her life in music was supplemented by her poetry. She wrote close to 500 poems, some of which she set to music. In 1981 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)It's an Honour: OBE and in 1991 was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).It's an Honour: AO She was awarded an honorary doctorate by Macquarie University in 1993, and in 2004 she received an award for Distinguished Services to Australian Music at the Australasian Performing Right Association and Australian Music Centre Classical Music Awards. She was appointed Patron of the Music Teachers' Association of South Australia (MTASA) and established the Miriam Hyde Award for the Association. After serving on the Council of the Music Teachers' Association of New South Wales from 1960 to 1991, she was made its patron.Crews and Spithill (2012) In 1991 her autobiography was published, titled Complete Accord. She celebrated her 80th birthday in 1993 by giving a series of recitals throughout the country. At the age of 89, she gave her last performance of her Piano Concerto No. 2, with the Strathfield Symphony Orchestra conducted by Solomon Bard.Concert programme 16 June 2002, Strathfield Symphony Orchestra Her 90th birthday in 2003 was marked with concerts and broadcasts throughout Australia. From the mid 1990s onwards, continuing after her death in 2005, The Keys Press (Perth) and Wirripang Pty Ltd (Wollongong) published more than 100 of her manuscripts for piano, chamber music and voice.The Keys Press: Published WorksWirripang: Biography and published works Miriam Hyde died in 2005, a few days before her 92nd birthday. Music Miriam Hyde's compositions include works for orchestra, piano concertos, art songs, chamber music, many piano solos, flute solos and more. She wrote in an early 20th-century pastoral style,Vale Dr Miriam Hyde achieving a highly effective combination of impressionism with post- romanticism. One of her best-known pieces is the piano solo Valley of Rocks, written in 1975. The Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat minor (1933), Piano Concerto No. 2 in C-sharp minor (1935) and Village Fair (1943) for orchestra are the most broadcast of her major works. One of her lesser known pieces is the mystical Reflected Reeds (1956) with its rippling chords sketching the Sydney landscape on a brooding afternoon. Her husband died in 1995 and she ceased writing music at that time. Recording - Romantic Piano Trios - Trio Anima Mundi (Divine Art dda25102) (2013) *feat. Fantasy for piano trio Writing The expression of words in a poetic form meant as much to Miriam Hyde as the expression of music. In an interview filmed in 1992 she revealed that it was often a matter of chance whether her impressions would be embodied in words or in music. Three selections of her poetry were published by the Economy Press, Adelaide: The Bliss of Solitude (1941), A Few Poems (1942) and Dawn to Dusk (1947?).Miriam Hyde Poems She also wrote her autobiography, Complete Accord (1991, Currency Press) and donated the royalties to the Elder Scholarship that she won in 1931.

Umuahia is located along the rail road that lies between Port Harcourt to its south and Enugu city to its north. Umuahia has a population of 359,230 according to the 2006 Nigerian census. Umuahia is indigenously Igbo. Umuahia is renowned for being a railway and agricultural market center, which attracts traders and farmers from neighboring towns to sell their produce, such as yams, cassava, corn (maize), taro, citrus fruits, and palm oil and kernels. There are industries that help drive its economy, such as a brewery and a palm-oil- processing plant. Nigeria's National Root Crops Research Institute, at Umudike, is adjacent to the town. Umuahia also has several colleges including Trinity College (theological), Government College Umuahia, Holy Rosary Girls Secondary School and hospitals like the Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia (formerly Queen Elizabeth Hospital). Umuahia comprises two local government areas: Umuahia North and Umuahia South. These local governments are also composed of clans such as the Umuopara, Ibeku, Olokoro, Ubakala and Ohuhu communities. Umuahia town is traditionally owned by the Ibeku after early British administrators based the town in their lands. History According to popular legend, the name Umuahia derives from the Igbo word AmaAhiaOma or \\"Ama Ahia\\", which means \\"market place or market center\\", respectively. British colonists, who arrived the area and invaded it sometime around the mid-to late 19th century, upon learning the name, mispronounced and misspelled it as \\"Umuahia\\". Other legends exist regarding the origin of Umuahia, but the foregoing version seems most probable by consensus. In precolonial times, it served as one of the central marketplaces in the region for commerce. Given its serenity and proximity to other towns, such as Ohafia, Abiriba, Arochukwu, Obowo, Ngwa, Okigwi, Uzuakoli, Bende, Nnewi, Akwa Akpa (Old Calabar), and Kalabari, merchants of produce, pottery, crafts, textile, traditional medicine, palm wine, and tools travelled from afar to trade at the busy market center with many roads leading to it. However, the name Ama Ahia was not the town's name; rather it was located in a place called Afor Ibeji near Olokoro Town. With increasing British administrative and commercial activities in the region and yonder, Umuahia, as it came to be known and written, was relocated to Ibeku Town for better oversight by administrative offices and the convergence of roads at Ibeku. The new location became one of the major trading posts along the rail route built by the United African Company (UAC) for carting produce, raw materials, and minerals along the trade route from Sub-Sahara to the Atlantic Ocean, for onward exportation to Europe. The trading post was named Umuahia-Ibeku Station to reflect the new market square and domain. Over time, the area became known as Umuahia, while the original market town at Afor Ibeji was renamed to Old Umuahia. The hyphenated Umuahia- Ibeku became a source of dispute, given that neighboring towns such as Ohuhu, Umuopara, Afugiri, Ofeme, etc., were constituted into the Umuahia administrative area, entitling them to be under Umuahia, not Umuahia - Ibeku, since Ibeku is on the same level as the constituent parts of Umuahia. Umuahia is composed of five sister clans, socially and phonologically homogenous at most, with each clan having its own version of autonomy and social evolution. Umuahia was established by the British colonial administration of Nigeria in the early 20th century. Umuahia was declared the second (and soon became the longest serving) capital of the short-lived nation of the Republic of Biafra on 28 September 1967 after the first capital, Enugu was captured by Nigerian troops. On June 28, 1968, Umuahia was captured by Nigerian troops during Operation OAU but was re-captured by Biafran troops on July 23 that same year. On April 22, 1969 Umuahia was occupied and nearly taken by Nigerian troops but they were forced to retreat due to a stiff offensive by Biafran Maj. E.A. Eutuk. After Umuahia's capture on 24 December 1969, the last Biafran capital before its dissolution became Owerri. Formerly known as Ikwuano/Umuahia Local government council until the Babangida-led government divided it into two LGAs‚ÄîIkwuano LGA and Umuahia LGA in 1991‚Äîand then later in 1996, the former Umuahia Local Government Area was split by Abacha-led government into two local governments: Umuahia North and Umuahia South. The first executive chairman of the old Umuahia local government area is Chief Chibiko Ukanwoke, elected in December 1991. Government College Umuahia and Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU) formerly Federal University of Agriculture (FUAU) now fall into the domain of Ikwuano people.  Umuahia Local Government Areas (LGAs)  There are two LGAs in Umuahia, namely; Umuahia North and Umuahia South. Both LGAs are made up of Clans, and villages make up the Clans. The South has three Clans, namely - Ubakala, Olokoro and Umuopara. The Local Government council Headquarters is located at Apumiri in Ubakala. The North consists of Ibeku (alongside the old umuahia environs) and Ohuhu. Its Local Government council Headquarters is located at Ibeku. Climate Umuahia's climate is classified as tropical.

Premise L√©onard is set in the early Renaissance period (with some aspects of the 20th century thrown in). He is an inventor and self- proclaimed genius who lives in a small town where he comes up with all sorts of inventions. Most of these are based on more recent, real-life achievements including television, fire extinguishers, cars and planes. He has also made more fanciful inventions like time machines and robots. L√©onard is flanked by Basile, his long-suffering (and often quite reluctant) assistant. L√©onard refers to his younger helper as \\"Disciple\\" (\\"Lackey\\" in the English version), while Basile calls him \\"Master\\". Basile shows, and not without good cause, little of the respect that L√©onard feels due to him and their relationship is more one of squabbling worker and employer than that of pupil and mentor. One cannot really blame the Disciple given the Master's arrogance and oversized ego. In fact, far from teaching his Disciple the ways of science, L√©onard looks upon him as a convenient guinea-pig for his inventions and shows little sympathy when they go wrong, which they almost always do. Still, L√©onard expects his Disciple to be enthusiastic about his inventions, and the resigned Disciple often ironically repeats his motto \\"I serve science and it's my joy\\" (). Storyline The most common storyline is that L√©onard comes up with the idea for an invention. He then proceeds to wake up his late-sleeping Disciple using various means which range from loudspeakers to explosives. After being blown to bits or suffering similar injuries, the Disciple gets himself together and grudgingly proceeds to help build and test L√©onard's latest idea. This invariably results in more damage to his body and soul, but failure to co-operate will result in him being on the receiving end of L√©onard's anvil or blunderbuss which the Master keeps conveniently tucked up in his beard. The story often ends with the Disciple covered in plaster and bandages and even having to go to hospital. Other characters Looking on are Raoul the cat, Bernadette the mouse, and Mathurine the housekeeper. The cat and the mouse are friends and often appear in on-the-side gags: while the main action is being played out by L√©onard and his Disciple, the cat and the mouse are involved in action of their own. Another recurring character is Cr√¢ne, a talking skull who comments on the scene. There is also a rival inventor, the Great Albert (based on Albert Einstein) who also has an assistant who is every bit as put-upon as Basile. Albert, who is in every way as brilliant and as arrogant as L√©onard, first appeared in a full-length adventure entitled La Guerre des g√©nies (French for \\"Genius Wars\\") ‚Äì which included a chapter called \\"Le G√©nie contre- attaque\\" (\\"The Genius Strikes Back\\"). Deciding that the town was not big enough for two geniuses, he and L√©onard engaged in a fiery feud with both of them coming up with increasingly devastating methods to try to get rid of the other. Running gags in the story included the angry inhabitants chasing both Leonardo and Albert out of town and both men joining forces on occasion to get rid of another passing genius, Nicolas Flamel, and his disciple. Although this story was entirely about the two fighting a huge battle, in later albums they are shown to be on more or less friendly terms.

He also wrote science fiction.  Biography  Born in Chicago in 1890, Keeler spent his childhood exclusively in this city, which was so beloved by the author that a large number of his works took place in and around it. In many of his novels, Keeler refers to Chicago as \\"the London of the west.\\" The expression is explained in the opening of Thieves' Nights (1929): > Here ... were seemingly the same hawkers ... selling the same goods ... here > too was the confusion, the babble of tongues of many lands, the restless, > shoving throng containing faces and features of a thousand racial castes, > and last but not least, here on Halsted and Maxwell streets, Chicago, were > the same dirt, flying bits of torn paper, and confusion that graced the > junction of Middlesex and Whitechapel High streets far across the globe. Other locales for Keeler novels include New Orleans and New York. In his later works, Keeler's settings are often more generic settings such as Big River, or a city in which all buildings and streets are either nameless or fictional. Keeler is known to have visited London at least once.  Early adulthood  Keeler's mother was a widow several times over who operated a boarding house popular with theatrical performers. Beginning around age sixteen, Keeler wrote a steady stream of original short stories and serials that were subsequently published in many small pulp magazines of the day. Circa 1910, when Keeler was about twenty, his mother committed him to an insane asylum for reasons unknown. This initialed Keeler's interest in madness, asylums and the predicament of sane people who had been consigned to such institutions. It also gave him a lifelong violent towards the psychiatric profession. Keeler attended the Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. It was at this time that Keeler met his future wife, Hazel Goodwin, whom he would marry in 1919. After graduation, he took a job as an electrician in a steel mill, working by day and writing by night. A notable early work was the 1915 science fiction story \\"John Jones' Dollar\\", originally published in magazine entitled The Black Cat. A reprint would appear in an early (1927) issue of Amazing Stories, the first American science fiction pulp. In the story, a single invested dollar, has by the 33rd century, grows to a fortune due to compound interest.\\"John Jones' Dollar\\" was first published in The Black Cat. E. F. Bleiler,Science-Fiction: The Gernsback YearsThe Kent State University Press, (p.209)  With E.P. Dutton  Eight of Keeler's earliest works first appeared in pulp fiction magazines like Complete Novel and Top Notch. His first four novels were originally released in England by Hutchinson, beginning in 1924, with The Voice of the Seven Sparrows. Beginning in 1927, E. P. Dutton took over publication of Keeler's novels in the US. Between 1927 and 1942, Dutton would go on to release 37 novels by Keeler. In the United Kingdom, publication of Keeler's novels, sometimes with altered titles and reworked prose, fell to Ward Lock, who went on to publish 48 novels by Keeler from 1929 to 1953. The Voice of the Seven Sparrows introduced audiences the world over to Keeler's complicated \\"webwork plot\\" story lines with wildly improbable in-story coincidences and sometimes sheerly baffling conclusions. Keeler's complex, labyrinthine stories generally alienated his intended reading audience. Owing to his popularity with Dutton, however, Keeler gained notoriety in the mid-1930s as a purveyor of new and original stories. His popularity peaked when his book Sing Sing Nights was used to \\"suggest\\" two different low-budget mystery-adventure films, namely Sing Sing Nights (Monogram Pictures, 1933) and The Mysterious Mr. Wong (Monogram, 1935), the latter of which starred screen legend Bela Lugosi. During this period Keeler was employed as an editor for Ten Story Book, a popular pulp short-story magazine that also included photos of nude and scantily clad young women.Francis M. Nevins, Jr., \\"Keeler, Harry Stephen\\", in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers, edited by John M. Reilly. St. James Press, 1985. (pp. 521‚Äì22) Keeler proceeded to fill the spaces between the features with his own peculiar brand of humor and included illustrations drawn by his wife. Here, he also often frequent publicized his own books. Keeler's relations with the Duttons grew erratic and strained. Keeler's 1941 novel The Peacock Fan appears to take a dig at the Duttons through a pair of faintly disguised characters. In his later career, Keeler's fiction and writing style grew more bizarre and his books longer. He often substituted plot with lengthy dialogue and diatribes between characters. His readership flagged. In 1942, after releasing The Book with the Orange Leaves, Keeler was dropped by Dutton. Ward Lock continued to issue his books in the United Kingdom until 1953.  Later years The years from 1942 to 1953 were difficult for Keeler. His writing drifted even further beyond the norm and short stories written by his wife (a moderately successful writer herself) were found more and more within his novels. Keeler typically padded the length of his novels with the following device: his protagonist would find a magazine or book, open it and random and discover a story. At this point, Keeler's novel would insert the complete verbatim text of one of his wife's short stories, this being the story his novel's protagonist was reading. At the end of the story, the novel would continue where it left off, several pages nearer to its contractual minimum word count. These stories-within-the-novel typically contained only a few scraps of information that were relevant to the novel in which they appeared. Keeler's novels were picked up by rental library publisher Phoenix Press, known in the business as the \\"last stop on the publishing bus.\\" By 1953, British publishers Ward Lock & Co printed their final Keeler novel, thus forcing the writer to pen his stories exclusively for an overseas market with stories often translated for publication in Spain and Portugal. Hazel died in 1960. Keeler remarried in 1963 to his onetime secretary Thelma Rinaldo, which rejuvenated his spirit for writing. Unfortunately, many of the new stories written by Keeler during this time went unpublished, including the relatively infamous The Scarlet Mummy. Keeler died in Chicago four years later, in 1967. He and his wife Hazel are buried in Rosehill Cemetery. After death In 2005, The Collins Library (an imprint of McSweeney's) republished Keeler's 1934 classic, The Riddle of the Traveling Skull, a project much pursued by writer and publisher Paul Collins. Ramble House has published other works by him  Writing techniques and preoccupations Most of Keeler's novels feature what Keeler called a \\"webwork plot\\". This can be defined as a plot that includes many strands or threads (each thread representing a character or significant object), which intersect in complex causal interactions. A webwork novel typically ends with a surprise revelation which clarifies these interactions. According to Keeler's 1927 series of articles on plot theory, \\"The Mechanics (and Kinematics) of Web-Work Plot Construction,\\" a webwork plot is typically built around a sequence in which the main character intersects at least four other strands, one after the other, and each of these encounters causes the next one. Keeler never claimed to have invented the webwork plot, but only to be its theorist and practitioner. Keeler followed a writing procedure of his own; he'd often write a huge manuscript, perhaps twice the length required. He'd then cut it down to size, removing unnecessary subplots and incidents. The removed material (which he called \\"the Chunk\\") would sit around until Keeler wrote another manuscript to use it, which might result in yet cutting procedure, and another \\"Chunk.\\" In his book Thieves' Nights, the hero reads a book which is about two other men telling stories: a framing device within a framing device. In another book, Keeler and his wife turn up as characters in a story. Keeler kept a large file of newspaper clippings featuring unusual stories and incidents. He is reputed to have pasted these into the rough outlines of his novels, adding notes like \\"Have this happen to... \\" Keeler is known for the MacGuffin-esque insertion of skulls into nearly all his stories. While many plots revolved around a skull or the use of one in a crime or ritual, others featured skulls as a diversion. As an example, a human skull was used as a paperweight on the desk of a police detective. Several of Keeler's novels make reference to a fictional book entitled The Way Out, which is apparently a tome of ancient Oriental wisdom. The significance of the nonexistent Way Out in Keeler's world is equivalent to the role played by the Necronomicon within H. P. Lovecraft's work. Influence and parallels In the late 1930s, British writer John Russell Fearn gave credit to Keeler for inspiring his experiments with webwork plots in his pulp SF stories.Richard Polt, \\"John Russell Fearn, Webworker Extraordinayre,\\" Keeler News no. 38, June 2002. Keeler has influenced later writers, including Neil Gaiman and Futurama producer Ken Keeler (no relation); Ken Keeler says in the DVD commentary for \\"Time Keeps on Slippin'\\" that the story \\"Strange Romance\\" from the book Y. Cheung, Business Detective was an inspiration for the episode. Writer Jack Woodford wrote the article Tale Incredible: The True Story of Harry Stephen Keeler's Literary Rise about Keeler. Keeler's webwork technique anticipates the so-called hysterical realism of later novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. Gabriele Rico in Writing the Natural Way advises aspiring writers to practice a form of webwork, which she calls \\"clustering\\", to encourage associational thinking which can be used to create characters and plot lines.Gabrielle Rico, Writing the Natural Way (Tarcher, 2000). Films that exhibit probably unwitting similarities to Keeler's work include Murder Story (1989), in which Christopher Lee plays a Keeler-like character who keeps a large collection of newspaper clippings as part of his \\"Willard Hope Technique\\" for writing novels, which closely resembles Keeler's \\"webwork novel\\" technique. R. Kelly's series of music videos Trapped in the Closet shows a number of parallels to Keeler's style.William Poundstone, \\"Trapped in the Closet: The Webwork Opera,\\" Keeler News no. 65, December 2007. In 2010, Harold S. Karstens published De Sciencefictionschrijver, a novel about one man's obsession with Keeler.Publisher's information The independent studio United Film House announced a plan to release \\"The Flyer Hold-Up\\" in 2015.United Film House website, a film based on Keeler's story \\"The Flyer Hold Up; or, The Mystery of Train Thirty-Eight\\", published in the Chicago Ledger in four parts from December 4‚Äì25, 1915.

He tried a number of careers in his early 20s, but at 25 began writing and translating. His best known novel is Sturmflut and his novel In Reih' und Glied was quite successful in Russia. Life Spielhagen was born in Magdeburg and brought up in Stralsund, where his father was appointed a government architect in 1835. He attended the gymnasium (roughly equivalent to an American high school) in Stralsund, studied law, and subsequently literature and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Bonn and Greifswald. At Bonn, he was a member of the Burschenschaft Franconia, which at that time also included Carl Schurz, Johannes Overbeck, Julius Schmidt, Carl Otto Weber, Ludwig Meyer and Adolf Strodtmann. In his Reminiscences, Schurz recalls Spielhagen as a person ‚Äúin whom, in spite of his somewhat distant and reserved character, we all recognized a man of rare intellectuality and moral elevation, and who later became a star of the first magnitude among the novelists of the century.‚Äù After leaving university, he tried his hand at being a private tutor, an actor, a soldier and a teacher in a school in Leipzig, but upon his father's death in 1854 he devoted himself entirely to writing. In 1859, he became editor of the Zeitung f√ºr Norddeutschland (Newspaper for Northern Germany) in Hannover, and then, in 1862, moved to Berlin where he later edited Westermanns illustrirte deutsche Monatshefte (Westermann's Illustrated German Monthly) 1878-84. As a translator, Spielhagen rendered into German George William Curtis's Howadji, Ralph Waldo Emerson's English Traits, a selection of American poems (1859; 2d ed. 1865), and William Roscoe's Lorenzo de' Medici. He also translated from the French minor works of Jules Michelet: L'amour, La femme, La mer. He married Therese Boutin (1835‚Äì1900) with whom he had a daughter, Elsa Spielhagen (1866‚Äì1942). He died on 25 February 1911. Streets are named after him in his hometown of Magdeburg, as well as the three cities in which he lived: Stralsund, Hannover, and Berlin. Novels and a play Berlin memorial tablet After publishing Clara Vere (1857) and Auf der D√ºne (1858), neither of which was widely read, he began to write for newspapers and journals. In 1861, he struck gold with Problematische Naturen (1860‚Äì1861; English translation ‚ÄúProblematic Characters,‚Äù by Prof. Schele de Vere, New York, 1869); it was followed a year later by a sequel, Durch Nacht zum Licht (English translation, ‚ÄúThrough Night to Light,‚Äù by Prof. Schele de Vere, New York, 1869), then by Die von Hohenstein (1863; English translation, ‚ÄúThe Hohensteins,‚Äù by Prof. Schele de Vere, 1870), In Reih' und Glied (1866), Hammer und Ambo√ü (1869; English translation, ‚ÄúHammer and Anvil,‚Äù by William Hand Browne, 1873), Deutsche Pioniere (1870), Allzeit voran (1872), Was die Schwalbe sang (1873; English translation, ‚ÄúWhat the Swallow Sang,‚Äù 1873), Ultimo (1874), Liebe f√ºr Liebe (a drama, which was produced in Leipzig; 1875), Sturmflut (based on the financial crises in Berlin following the Franco-Prussian War; 1876), Plattland (1878), Quisisana (1880), Angela (1881), Uhlenhans (1884), Ein neuer Pharao (1889), Faustulus (1897) and Freigeboren (1900) among many others. These days, Sturmflut is his best known work though it is currently only available in an abridged form. Spielhagen's later works were almost entirely on literary theory. Spielhagen's S√§mtliche Werke (Complete Works) were published in 1871 in sixteen volumes, in 1878 in fourteen volumes. His S√§mtliche Romane (Complete Novels) followed in 1898 (22 vols), and these were followed by a new series in 1902. In 1890, he published his autobiography, Finder und Erfinder (2 vols, 1890). His novel In Reih' und Glied, translated into Russian as –û–¥–∏–Ω –≤ –ø–æ–ª–µ –Ω–µ –≤–æ–∏–Ω [literally Odin v pole ne voin, a proverb meaning \\"One man in the field is not a warrior\\" or \\"One man alone can't win a war\\"] (1867‚Äì1868), with its revolutionary protagonist Leo (based on Ferdinand Lassalle), was extraordinarily popular in Russia, and virtually all his novels were subsequently translated there at least once, collected editions being brought out in 1895 (8 vols.) and 1898 (30 vols.).Brockhaus & Efron article.

He served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1895 and 1905. Background and education Gully was the son of Dr James Manby Gully of Malvern, a successful physician who became involved in the mysterious death of Charles Bravo in April 1876. His grandfather was Daniel Gully, a Jamaican coffee planter. He was educated at University College School, London and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was president of the Union. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1860, went the northern circuit, and took silk in 1877. Political career Gully in the Speaker's rooms, 1905 \\"Mr Speaker\\" as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, September 1896 In 1880 and 1883 Gully unsuccessfully contested Whitehaven as a Liberal, but was elected for Carlisle in 1886, and continued to represent that constituency until his elevation to the peerage. In April 1895 he was elected Speaker by a majority of eleven votes over Sir Matthew White Ridley, the Unionist nominee. The choice of Gully was a surprise to Lord Rosebery's cabinet. Rosebery did not want a Unionist as the new Speaker of the House of Commons, but rejected the two alternatives of Richard Haldane and Sir Frank Lockwood. Rosebery faced hostility in his cabinet from Sir William Vernon Harcourt and from the opposition, and Harcourt wanted the Liberal Unionist Leonard Courtney as Speaker. Harcourt viewed this as purely a matter for the House of Commons (Rosebery being in the House of Lords). To Rosebery it became a minor cabinet crisis. Finally in disgust Harcourt placed the onus of the decision on Rosebery. Eventually the backbenchers of the Commons who knew Gully propelled him - most likely because he was close to Sir William Herschell. Harcourt was forced to produce the name to the House of Commons. The Conservatives were not happy about his selection, and (recalling the scandal that engulfed his father) would greet his appearance in the House with cries of \\"Bravo, Gully!\\".Ruddick, p. 185 In 1905 he resigned and was raised to the peerage with the title of Viscount Selby, of the City of Carlisle, the name being that of his wife (see below). He died in November 1909, aged 74, and was succeeded by his son, James. Family Lord Selby married, in 1865, Elizabeth Selby (died 1906), daughter of Thomas Selby. They had six children: *James William Herschell Gully, 2nd Viscount Selby (1867‚Äì1923) *Hon. Edward Walford Karslake Gully, CB (1870‚Äì1931), who married 1901 Ada Symon *Hon.

Piranesi \\"View of the Baths of Titus\\" The Baths of Titus or Thermae Titi were public baths (Thermae) built in 81 AD at Rome, by Roman emperor Titus.Suet. Titus 7 http://latin.packhum.org/loc/1348/1/0#229 The baths sat at the base of the Esquiline Hill, an area of parkland and luxury estates which had been taken over by Nero (AD 54‚Äì68) for his Golden House or Domus Aurea. Titus' baths were built in haste, possibly by converting an existing or partly built bathing complex belonging to the reviled Domus Aurea. They were not particularly extensive, and the much larger Baths of Trajan were built immediately adjacent to them at the start of the next century. The Baths of Titus were restored during the reign of Hadrian as well as in AD 238 but no further repairs are known.Hist. Aug. Max. et Balb. ICIL 6.9797 It is thus likely that the entire complex underwent a process of early abandonment. Large parts of the building were still standing in the 16th century when Andrea Palladio described the floor plan. The ruins were demolished shortly afterwards, their marble and building materials being reused for the building of palaces and churches such as the side chapels of the Church of the Ges√π or the fountain of the Cortile del Belvedere in the Vatican. One of the features of the baths was mural designs by the artist Famulus (or Fabullus), both al fresco and al stucco. Before the designs fell into disrepair from exposure to the elements, Nicholas Ponce copied and reproduced them as engravings in his volume \\"Description des bains de Titus\\" (Paris, 1786). The designs are now recognized as a source of the style known as \\"grotesque\\" (meaning \\"like a small cave, a hollow, a grotto\\") because the ruins of the Baths of Titus were in a hollow in the ground when they were discovered.Lecture 12 - The Creation of an Icon: The Colosseum and Contemporary Architecture in Rome as author at YALE HSAR 252 - Roman Architecture with Professor Diana E.

According to a 2007 census conducted by indigenous organisations, 6, 024 people self-identified as being of Pech descent. This indigenous group primarily speak in their native tongue, the Pech language, which is a member of the Macro-Chibchan languages. Although, in recent developments, the language is mainly spoken by older generations and is in danger of being extinct in the relative near future. The Pech people reside in the north-eastern territories of Honduras, particularly in the areas of Colon, Gracias a Dios and Olancho. Since their migration to these areas, believed to have migrated from the southern areas of modern-day Colombia, the Pech people have undergone reduction to their land ownership and rights. The regions where the Pech people live were originally densely forested, however, has recently undergone deforestation. Many of the Pech's agricultural practices had to undergo reform, although, some traditional practices are still in place today. The Pech leaders continue to struggle to preserve their culture and language, putting the Pech people in danger of becoming extinct.  Name  Angel Simeon Martinez representing the Pech people at a forum of the ACALing conference at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras The name \\"Pech\\" derives from the Pech-language ethnonym Pech, the name that refers only to themselves. For the Pech to refer to other groups, the term \\"Pech- Hakua\\" will be used, meaning \\"other people\\".  History   Pre-Colonial Period  Official flag of HondurasSocial complexity began among the Pech or probable Pech speakers as long ago as 300 CE. The earlier Pech cultures may have been developed independently of the Maya, their near neighbours, or they may have been influenced by the Maya, a hypothesis that has been corroborated to some extent by the discovery of Mayan loan-words in the Pech language.Dennis Holt and William Bright, \\"La lengua paya y las fronteras ling√º√≠sticas de Mesoam√©rica\\" in Las fronteras de Mesoam√©rica: XIV Mesa Redonda, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 23‚Äì28 de junio 1975, 1:149‚Äì56. M√©xico: Sociedad Mexicana de Antropolog√≠a, 1975 Before the colonial period in the sixteenth century, the Pech people migrated from the south to inhabit a large territory close to the border of Nicaragua. The Pech Indians occupied a large portion of north-eastern Honduran land, which anthropologists define as \\"lower Central America.\\" According to anthropologists, this lower sector of Central America was considered to be a part of the \\"lesser-developed intermediate area of Honduras.\\" This land that the Pech people occupied was greatly reduced following conflicts with neighbouring community, the Miskito.  16th to 20th Century  Settlements and groups in 16th-century Honduras In archaeological reckoning, the Pech formed a number of chiefdoms, some of which left archaeological remains of some sophistication, and certainly by the time of the Spanish exploration of the region in the early 16th century, the coastal regions were dominated by substantial chiefdoms. Spanish records of the mid-16th and early 17th centuries refer to a paramount chiefdom called Taguzgalpa, which dominated the region. Spanish attempts to conquer it in the 16th century were unsuccessful. The Pech people's ownership of land and culture all changes after the Spanish colonisation of Honduras. Between 1622 and 1623, Crist√≥bal Mart√≠nex, Benito de San Francisco and Juan de Beena, founded the Paya reductions in the areas of Concepci√≥n de Xuara, Azocegua, Taxamba, Barbatabacha, Zuy and Barcaquer.Atanasio Herranz and Scott Sessions, ‚ÄúPech\\", in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures, ed. Davd Carrasco et al. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001). Following, in 1713, the son of Bartolom√© de Escoto, a Spanish coloniser, was titled as the \\"governor and conqueror of the Paya\\" and was earning a salary of \\"one hundred pesos.\\" When the Spanish colonisers landed on Honduras, one hundred percent of the occupied territory of eastern Honduras was under the control of the native and indigenous American population. After contact and spread of Spanish presence, the Pech people were forced to retreat and live under control of the Spanish colonists, like many other indigenous groups. Upon arrival, the Spanish colonists recognised the Pech people as 'Xicaque' which remains to still be in use today. At the beginning of 1805, the Pech people were displaced from Cabo Camar√≥n to their current location, along the mouth of the Agu√°n River. During this period, the Pech people suffered large reductions to their territory. The Pech reduction took place in the territories of Buenaventura in the Olancho Valley in 1739, Siguatepeque in 1767, R√≠o Tinto in 1797 and Franciscans, which accelerated the influence of Spanish culture and the loss of traditional Pech culture. Between 1859 and 1860, Manuel Subirana, a Spanish Jesuit, baptised 600 individuals of the Pech population. Although the Pech's response to the Spanish settlement was much more peaceful than the response from neighbouring indigenous groups, such as the Jicaque or Tolupan. On the land the Pech inhabited, the presence of gold and sarsaparilla plants attracted foreigners and other Honduran populations to claim the land. Foreigners enslaved the Pech to extract the natural resources from their own lands, resulting in the land being stripped of its resources of gold, timber and plants.  Present  Today, there are less than a dozen Pech communities that remain in Honduras. The population of Pech people in 1933 was 2, 586, of whom only 994 claimed the Pech language as their first language. Pech people face the danger of their native tongue becoming extinct in the distant future. While young Pech people can understand Pech on the whole, they mainly speak Spanish. There are some efforts in the community by Pech leaders to revitalise the native language, however, there has reportedly been inadequate support from the government. In 2004, the National Bilingual Programme was introduced, which aimed to improve the English language skills of indigenous populations, which also contributes to the struggle to revitalise the native Pech language. Other problems that the Pech face today include the increasing Hispanicisation of Pech children, the reduction of cultivable land and woodcutting by private enterprises. Also in 2004, Pech land rights activist and community leader, Elipidio Martinez Chavarria was killed in Dulce Nombre de Culmi, Olancho, as part of the violence connected to land-grabbing.  Culture  According to historians, Martynas Snarskis and Mary W. Helms, pre-European settlement, the Pech people did not possess \\"key cultural attributes as highly stratified societies, political organisation at the state level, intensive agricultural cultivation techniques, metallurgy, or large urban centres.\\"  Agriculture/Economy  The Pech people have always made a living by fishing and shifting agriculture. This is due to the lack of plant-supplied protein and nutrients in the diets of root croppers. The Pech people acquired the balance of their diet from the practice of hunting and fishing. In order to hunt, the Pech people utilise the 'cerbatana' (a type of blowgun), bow and arrow, and traps. These techniques are still used today in Pech communities. Formerly the Pech hunted quadrupeds such as deer, which are rare today. The Pech hunt an array of birds such as paca, pheasant, armadillo, cashew bird and agouti. When fishing, the Pech people utilise a harpoon and use ground soap plants to poison the water. For the Pech, fishing also consists of gathering crustaceans and mollusks, including shrimp, crabs and jute, a freshwater snail. The main characteristics of Pech agriculture is the clearing of trees. A 'slash and burn' method, where stone axe and fire are used to clear a field of trees and undergrowth of roots, is implemented to dig sticks to plant. Today the main economic activities conducted by the Pech people include tree clearing, gold panning, breeding domestic animals and extracting fragrant resin from liquidambar for perfumes, incense and adhesives. The Pech people also earn profit from selling handcrafted items, including woven baskets, bags, placements and corn-grinding stones. Pech Ceramic Work  Ceramics  In 2003, a collection of ceramic bowls, plates and jars were discovered in a closet at the University of South Florida. This collection of ceramic pieces were later uncovered to be the craftsmanship of Honduran indigenous peoples, the Pech. Subsequently, Walter Lehmann as well as archaeologists Doris Stone and Jeremiah Epstein suggested that \\"the ceramic artefacts found at Islas de la Bah√≠a were similar to those found in Pech territory on the mainland.\\"  Language  Assorted Pech craft One of the main characteristics of the Pech people is that they speak in the native tongue of their own language. Their language belongs to the family of Macro-Chibchan languages. Some Pech people also speak Miskito, the language belonging to the neighbouring Miskito indigenous people. The word \\"taia\\", meaning \\"mine\\", offers the earliest indication of Paya occupation on the Honduran mainland. This is because \\"taia\\" represents a Pech place name for the lands they previously occupied in contrast to the lands that were occupied by other, non-Pech people, which is referred to as \\"maia\\". The Pech people consider to own land once they are able to live on land outside the realm of others.  Cosmogony  Cosmogony is a centrepiece in the Pech belief system as it presents the way they believe the universe is structured and created. Much of Pech cosmogony is based on dualities. For instance, the father God, named Patako-ko, is divided into two separate parts, one celestial and the other terrestrial and is in a constant struggle to vanish the celestial part. For the Pech people, the universe takes on the form of a sphere and has four beams supporting its structure. Within this universe, the subterranean world is inhabited by ferocious animals and ants, the earth is the level where humans live and the sky is divided into seven levels where abysses, lakes and the eternal fire of the sun exist.  Religion  Most Pech people today identify as Catholic and have only retained a small amount of myths and oral stories from their traditional religions. Pech traditional religion included ceremonies to the spirit of the mountains, the spiritual owners of animals, and to the mermaid who cares for the fish.  Geography  It is believed that the Pech people migrated in a northward direction from the area currently known as Colombia at some point in the past. The earliest indication of Pech life and presence dates back to Christoper Columbus' trip where he reached the Bay Islands and the mainland of Honduras on July 30, 1502. The earliest Pech presence can also be found in the writing of Martyr. Originally, the Pech people inhabited from interior departments of eastern Honduras to the south of present day Trujillo. Although, during the colonial period, the Pech people were relocated to mining areas of mainland Honduras. Usually, rivers act as the indicator for the borders of Pech territory, such as the Agu√°n River, which borders with the Jicaque people, and the Cuyamel River, territory of Cabo de Gracias a Dios. Pech people tend to live in mountainous areas full on forestation.  Conflict with Miskito People  Territorial conflict over the control of the land and its resources was competed against neighbouring indigenous Honduras groups. Growing land displacements, dispositions and a lack of territorial formalisation is a prominent daily challenge of indigenous peoples in Honduras. For the Pech people, this challenge stems from a history of conflict with neighbouring indigenous group, the Miskito People. The aggressive raids of the Miskito were in large manner responsible for the gradual withdrawal of the Pech into the mountainous regions and away from the coast. Beginning from the middle of the 17th century, it has been documented that the Miskito dominated the coastal Pech people and were forced to take rescue along the Patuca, Sicre, Platano, Twas, Paulaya and Sico rivers as well as in the Olancho valley. The Pech suffered heavily from the emergence of the Miskito in the 17th century and their alliance with outsiders, especially British traders, and with the runaway slaves who made up the \\"Mosquitos zambos\\".  Legal Protection  The Pech people are considered to be one of the nine ethnic groups recognised by the Honduran state, the others including Tawkahka, Tolupan, Lenca, Maya horit, Graifuna, Islenos de Habla Inglesa and Nahua. According to the 2001 government census, the population of the Pech is listed as 4, 138. These groups were the only indigenous groups named by the census, allowing the Pech people to be recognised both by legal and non-legal bodies. The Federation of Pech Tribes of Honduras unites 12 Pech tribes and aims to protect their ancestral lands. Previously, the Federation fought the creation of a 'people-free' national park, which aimed to cut communities off from their traditional livelihoods and stop the using of land to harvest liquidambar, a sweet gum used in fragrances. In efforts to fight these 'people-free' national parks, the Honduran government, instead signed a co- management agreement with the Pech people. This agreement legally allows the Pech people to co-manage 34, 000 hectares of the Anthropological and Forest Reserve, Montana del Carbon. The Federation has also established a liquidambar cooperative, which shares the profit between community members and funding for education and public health systems. The Federation also gave the Pech community international attention when it won the Equator Prize, an award organised by the United Nations Development Programme's Equator Initiative. The Pech people are also protected under the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH). The IHAH is a government agency that was founded in 1952. According to the IHAH, this agency is \\"dedicated to conserving, protecting, and in some sense, officially defining the country's national culture.\\" The IHAH maintains arachnological sites where ethnographic and historical research takes place for the elaborations of Honduras. In conjunction with the Honduran government's push for tourism, the IHAH, produces a vision of Honduran national identity that is functional to the needs of the international tourism industry. Previous studies on tourism in the Honduran north-eastern coast, have discovered that tourism investment, including actions of the Honduran government and United Nations program, have resulted in community division, environmental damage and dispossession of land with profits remaining in the hands of elite Honduran and international tourist investors. International Labour Organization (ILO) Flag The Pech people are among the indigenous groups recognised under the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 (No. 169), which was ratified by the Honduran government in 1995. In particular, the Honduran government has pledged to protect the territorial rights for the state's indigenous and Afro-descendant communities. The Pech people have become increasingly integrated economically and politically into Honduran law and society as the economic activity and settlement has advanced into the Pech region. In the 19th century, Spanish missionary, Father Manuel del Jesus Subirana, recognised the significant relationship between the Pech and the land and helped the Pech people acquire title to land ownership in 1862. Furthermore, some Pech communities situated in the Olancho valley, joined the Uni√≥n de Campesinos (UNC) in an effort to reclaim their land territory.  Current Issues  During the dictatorship of General Tiburcio Carias Andino between 1933 and 1948, the process of 'Mayanisaton', as coined by Euraque, constructed a national identity that ignored the lived realities of indigenous groups of Honduras. Investments from Central American Banks, Harvard, Pennsylvania State and Tulane contributed to this process by funding restoration projects, including the restoration of arachnological sites in Copan. Later, in the 1970s, this was projected as a priority by the Ministry of Tourism. The Pech people continue to fight the impacts of this and tourism today.

Note depiction of the single bond.Lewis structure for methane. Note depiction of the four single bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms. Lewis structure for an alkane. Note that all the bonds are single covalent bonds. In chemistry, a single bond is a chemical bond between two atoms involving two valence electrons. That is, the atoms share one pair of electrons where the bond forms. Therefore, a single bond is a type of covalent bond. When shared, each of the two electrons involved is no longer in the sole possession of the orbital in which it originated. Rather, both of the two electrons spend time in either of the orbitals which overlap in the bonding process. As a Lewis structure, a single bond is denoted as AÀêA or A-A, for which A represents an element (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 329). In the first rendition, each dot represents a shared electron, and in the second rendition, the bar represents both of the electrons shared in the single bond. A covalent bond can also be a double bond or a triple bond. A single bond is weaker than either a double bond or a triple bond. This difference in strength can be explained by examining the component bonds of which each of these types of covalent bonds consists (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 393). Usually, a single bond is a sigma bond. An exception is the bond in diboron, which is a pi bond. In contrast, the double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond, and a triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 396). The number of component bonds is what determines the strength disparity. It stands to reason that the single bond is the weakest of the three because it consists of only a sigma bond, and the double bond or triple bond consist not only of this type of component bond but also at least one additional bond. The single bond has the capacity for rotation, a property not possessed by the double bond or the triple bond. The structure of pi bonds does not allow for rotation (at least not at 298 K), so the double bond and the triple bond which contain pi bonds are held due to this property. The sigma bond is not so restrictive, and the single bond is able to rotate using the sigma bond as the axis of rotation (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 396-397). Another property comparison can be made in bond length. Single bonds are the longest of the three types of covalent bonds as interatomic attraction is greater in the two other types, double and triple. The increase in component bonds is the reason for this attraction increase as more electrons are shared between the bonded atoms (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 343). Single bonds are often seen in diatomic molecules. Examples of this use of single bonds include H2, F2, and HCl. Single bonds are also seen in molecules made up of more than two atoms. Examples of this use of single bonds include: *Both bonds in H2O *All 4 bonds in CH4 Single bonding even appears in molecules as complex as hydrocarbons larger than methane. The type of covalent bonding in hydrocarbons is extremely important in the nomenclature of these molecules. Hydrocarbons containing only single bonds are referred to as alkanes (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 334). The names of specific molecules which belong to this group end with the suffix -ane. Examples include ethane, 2-methylbutane, and cyclopentane (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 335).  References  Moore, John W., Conrad L. Stanitski, and Peter C. Jurs.

Early life Selwyn was born in Kilmington, Somerset (now in Wiltshire), England, the son of the Rev. Townshend Selwyn (Canon of Gloucester Cathedral) and his wife, Charlotte Sophia, daughter of Lord George Murray, bishop of St David's, Wales, and granddaughter of the fourth Duke of Athol. Educated by private tutors at home and afterwards in Switzerland, where he became interested in geology, Selwyn joined the staff of the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1845 under Sir Henry De la Beche and Sir A. C. Ramsay. Selwyn was actively engaged in the survey of North Wales and bordering portions of Shropshire, and a series of splendid geological maps resulted from his joint work with Ramsay and J. B. Jukes, This references a memoir with portrait in Geological Magazine (Feb. 1899). earning a great commendation from Ramsay. Selwyn was promoted to geologist on 1 January 1848. Australia glacial pavement at Inman Valley, later dated to the Permian In 1852 the Colonial Office appointed Selwyn director of the Geological Survey of Victoria of the recently founded colony of Victoria, where he built up an excellent staff including Richard Daintree, C. D. H. Aplin, Charles Smith Wilkinson, Reginald Murray, Edward John Dunn, Henry Yorke Lyell Brown and Robert Etheridge, Junior, with Sir Frederick McCoy as palaeontologist. He was a strict disciplinarian and from the beginning set up a very high standard of work in his department. During his 17 years as director, over 60 geological maps were issued which were among the best of their period: they were models of accuracy which established a tradition of geological mapping in Australia. Selwyn was well qualified to analyse the Silurian strata. He was also responsible for several reports on the geology of Victoria and added much to the knowledge of gold-bearing rocks. Selwyn discovered the Caledonian goldfield near Melbourne in 1854 and in the following year reported on coal seams in Tasmania, until in 1869 the Colonial Legislature brought the Survey to an abrupt termination on economic grounds. Canada In 1869 Sir William E. Logan retired as director of the Geological Survey of Canada and hand- picked his successor. Selwyn was his choice and took up his duties on 1 December 1869, but he faced a huge challenge: the geological mapping of the country as a task had grown tenfold due to the expanded size of Canada, stemming from Confederation in 1867, with more territories (Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island) added within the following decade. Selwyn (seated at centre) and his field party, during their 1871 survey of British Columbia Selwyn's 25 years as director was a period of intense activity during which GSC geologists mounted expeditions to many parts of the newly added territories. Following in Logan's footsteps, Selwyn directed the GSC mainly from the field. As a student in Switzerland, he had become an accomplished mountain climber ‚Äì a skill that proved invaluable to his extensive work in Canada's rugged new \\"Alpine province,\\" British Columbia. As a condition of joining Canada in 1871, British Columbia had insisted on the construction of a railroad to link it to eastern Canada. In 1871 Selwyn, as his first task as Director of the Survey, mounted a particularly arduous expedition to investigate the geology and mineral resources along the proposed railroad routes. Under Selwyn there was a great surge of exploratory surveys, mainly in the west and the north. It was an extraordinary challenge demanding extraordinary talents. Fieldwork in remote uncharted wildernesses required superb frontier survival skills coupled with the eclectic scientific background necessary to record the geology, topography, the flora and fauna of the new lands being explored. To carry out this far-ranging work, a larger staff was required and, with newly secured funding for the Survey from the government, Selwyn was able to build up his staff from six parties in the field in 1870 to fourteen in 1890. That same year, Parliament passed an act making the Geological Survey a separate department of the government, reporting to the Minister of the Interior. This was solid recognition of the Survey's growing importance to the expansion of Canada's economy. Selwyn also faced the challenge of moving the headquarters of the Survey from its longtime home in Montreal (since 1842) to Ottawa in 1881. The move triggered a tremendous outcry in Montreal, with the main concern being the loss of the GSC's popular museum. It also involved a logistics challenge, given the weight and size of many of the rock, mineral and fossil specimens in the GSC collections.

In 1876 he was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London, and he was created CMG in 1886 for his distinguished work as assistant to the Canadian Commissioners at the exhibitions in Philadelphia (1876), Paris (1878) and London (1886).

It is located on the southern shores of Lake Morat (also known as Lake Murten). Morat is situated between Bern and Lausanne and is the capital of the See/Lac District of the canton of Fribourg. It is one of the municipalities with a majority (about 75%) of German speakers in the predominantly French-speaking Canton of Fribourg. On 1 January 1975 the former municipality of Burg bei Murten merged into the municipality of Murten.Nomenklaturen ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 9 February 2013 It was followed on 1 January 1991 by the former municipality of Altavilla and on 1 January 2013 by the former municipality of B√ºchslen. On 1 January 2016 the former municipalities of Courlevon, Jeuss, Lurtigen and Salvenach merged into Morat (Murten).Nomenklaturen ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 3 February 2016 History The oldest archaeological traces of a settlement around Morat are from the Mesolithic (8200-5500 BC). The Mesolithic finds are mostly small flint shards for use in weapons or tools. These flints were produced mostly in the swampy lowlands east of the city at Murten-Combette and Murten-Ober Prehl. While many of these flint objects are in museums, the exact discovery sites were not properly documented and have been lost or covered by later excavations. Several other sites were discovered during construction of the A1 motorway in 1976‚Äì95. These settlements are from the Neolithic (5500-2500 BC) and the Bronze Age (2300-800 BC). Murten Pr√© de la Blanc was used in the Neolithic and middle Bronze Age, while the sites Murten-Lowenberg, Murten-Ober Prehl and Chantemerle 1 are from the Late Bronze Age. The cemetery at Lowenberg was used for more than a millennium, from the middle Bronze Age to the La T√®ne period. The nearby necropolis holds a number of Hallstatt era graves. The remains of a large Roman villa from the end of 1st or early 2nd century BC and a piece of a Roman road have also been found. Berntor/Porte de Berne in Morat The town's name derives from the Celtic word moriduno, meaning \\"lakeside fortress\\" . It was first mentioned in 515 as a defensive place called \\"Muratum\\". In 1013 the area was fortified by King Rudolph III of Burgundy. The fortifications were attacked and occupied by Odo II of Blois- Champagne in 1032 during the conflict after Rudolph's death. Odo only held Murten briefly before Emperor Conrad II besieged and destroyed the castle. In 1079 Emperor Henry IV granted Muratum and other properties to the Bishop of Lausanne. Murten was founded by Duke Berchtold IVMurten/Morat tourism-History of the city accessed 15 December 2011 of Z√§hringen or Landri de Durnes, the Bishop of Lausanne in either 1159 or during the 1170s or 1180s next to the fortress. Murten was first mentioned as a city in 1238. After his death the German emperor Frederic II recognized Murten as a \\"Free Imperial Town\\". At that time the emperor himself lived in the south of Italy and a small town north of the Alps was not his concern. It did not last long ‚Äì in 1255 Murten fell under the protection of Count Peter of Savoy. When Philip I of Savoy refused to give Morat to him, King Rudolph of Habsburg seized it as a royal estate. After Rudolf's death Amadeus V of Savoy, bought the city again in 1291, but lost it to King Albert I of Germany again. The House of Savoy bought the city and surrounding lands again in 1310 for 4,000 marks of silver. This time the city remained under Savoy control. During this time, Murten began to develop alliances and ties with the surrounding Swiss cities. In 1245 they created a treaty with Fribourg, followed in 1335 with Bern. A fire in 1416 led to rebuilding in stone. The battle of Morat On 22 June 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, laid siege to the place in an action known as the Battle of Morat. The town hung on for 13 days but finally was saved by the Bernese army. The enemy's army was destroyed completely ‚Äî some 10,000 Burgundians were killed. Since then, Murten celebrates the victory every year on June 22. From 1484 on, and for 300 years, Murten was ruled by the two cantons ‚Äî Bern and Fribourg. In 1530, under pressure from Bern, Murten adopted the Protestant Reformation, after the preacher Guillaume Farel began to preach the new faith. Murten's Protestant faith often brought the city into conflicts with the more conservative, Catholic Fribourg. During the second half of the 17th century the city grew wealthy on trade over the road from Bern to Vaud and along the Broye river to Yverdon. Most of the houses in the city were rebuilt with this wealth. Although Bern and Fribourg had already granted Murten permission in 1584 to form guilds, the coopers, carpenters, locksmiths and cabinet makers first formed their guilds in 1731. In the late 17th century a brickyard and a brewery were built outside of town. Following the 1798 French invasion, under the Helvetic Republic Murten was part of the Canton of Sarine and Broye. When the Republic collapsed, the Act of Mediation in 1803 gave the town to the canton of Fribourg. Aerial photograph from 300 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) Morat harbor Industrialization began in Murten in the early 1850s when Etienne-Ovide Domon founded a watch factory, which was later moved to Montelier . The Petitpierre family operated an absinthe distillery between 1831‚Äì1901 and Oskar Roggen ran a winery from 1888‚Äì1913. Since 1855 Murten has had its own newspaper, the \\"Murtenbieter\\". In the 20th Century other industries settled in Murten; especially in the field of precision engineering, electronics and food. In 1973, the Swiss Federal Railways bought L√∂wenberg Castle and lands from the family de Rougemont, to establish a training center. In 1856, a plan to run the Lausanne-Bern railway line through Morat was shelved and the line was rerouted through Fribourg. The loss of revenue from transportation affected Murten for almost twenty years. This changed in 1875‚Äì76 with the construction of the Pal√©zieux-Murten-Lyss railway line. This first line was followed in 1898 with the Fribourg-Murten line and in 1903 with the Murten-Ins line, known collectively as the Fribourg‚ÄìIns railway. Steamship service between Murten and Neuch√¢tel began in 1835. The Bon Vouloir Hospital, opened in 1867 in Meyriez and by the 1920s it became the district hospital. The tourism industry, began with the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the Battle of Morat in 1876. Geography View across Murten/Morat haven toward the old city on a hill above the lake Morat has an area of . Before the mergers expanded the municipal borders, or 51.4% was used for agricultural purposes, while or 26.2% were forested. Of the rest of the land, or 21.6% were settled (buildings or roads), or 0.2% were either rivers or lakes and or 0.2% was unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office- Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 9.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 9.1%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.2%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 40.4% is used for growing crops and 9.5% is pastures, while 1.4% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. The small medieval town lies in the Swiss \\"Midlands\\" on the edge of the Great Marsh, on a gentle hill ( above sea level) and on the shore of Lake Morat (or the Murtensee in German). Numerous attractions from a significant past have been well preserved here, such as the castle, the ring wall, the street scene and the arcades. Lake Morat is a smaller lake located in between Lake Biel and the lake Neuch√¢tel. Mont Vully stands on the western side of the Seeland's largest plain and resembles a pearl gently placed among the three lakes of Murten, Neuch√¢tel and Biel/Bienne. Already long ago, the Celtic and Helvetic tribes appreciated the region's temperate climate and the local countryside's particular charm. Today, the Vully vineyards take up a large part of the south face of Mont Vully. The over 100 hectares of vineyards are facing towards Lake Morat. Morat is also famous in history for the defeat of Charles the Bold by the Swiss in 1476. The former fortified city has kept most of its ramparts and towers.

They inhabited both marine and freshwater habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, and include genera such as Hesperornis, Parahesperornis, Baptornis, Enaliornis, and Potamornis, all strong-swimming, predatory divers. Many of the species most specialized for swimming were completely flightless. The largest known hesperornithean, Canadaga arctica, may have reached a maximum adult length of over . Hesperornitheans were the only Mesozoic avialans to colonize the oceans. They were wiped out in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, along with enantiornitheans and all other non-avian dinosaurs, as well as many other diverse plant and animal groups. Anatomy and ecology Life restoration of Hesperornis regalis Most of what is known about this group rests on analyses of single species, as few provide sufficiently complete fossils for analysis. Although some of the smaller and more primitive species, like those belonging to the subgroups Enaliornithidae and Brodavidae, might have been able to fly, the larger hesperornithids like Hesperornis and Baptornis had only vestigial wings. As in the case of modern foot-propelled diving birds, the femur and metatarsus of these animals were short, whereas the tibia was long. The legs were also set far back on the body, as in loons, grebes or penguins. Hesperornithids must have been powerful swimmers and divers but extremely ungainly on the land, and probably spent little time ashore except to nest. They were rather long-bodied, and measured about long. Some researchers think that on land they had to slide on their bellies and push with their legs; the hip and knee joints were shaped such that these species could not move them dorsoventrally, and in a resting position the feet projected sideways from the body, which would have prevented them from walking upright. The anatomy of their toes suggests that hesperornitheans had lobes of skin for propulsion underwater similar to grebes, rather than being webbed. The dense bones of these animals decreased their buoyancy, making diving easier. However, morphometric comparison with modern diving birds suggests that herperornitheans share more similarities with diving ducks and cormorants rather than with loons or grebes. The snout was long, and tipped with a slightly hooked beak. Behind the beak, the jaws were filled with a series of simple, sharp teeth which were set into a longitudinal groove. These probably helped to seize fish, like the serrated beak of mergansers; unlike the reptilian teeth of more primitive avialans, those of the hesperornithids were unique.Marsh, Othniel Charles (1880): Odontornithes, a Monograph on the Extinct Toothed Birds of North America. Government Printing Office, Washington DC. They also retained a dinosaur-like joint between the lower jaw bones. It is believed that this allowed them to rotate the back portion of the mandible independently of the front, thus allowing the lower teeth to disengage. Evolution Currently, the hesperornitheans are recognized as a very specialized lineage that is not ancestral or otherwise closely related to birds. Still, their relationship is close enough that they probably diverged from the ancestors of modern birds as late as the earliest Cretaceous. The earliest known hesperornithine is the Early Cretaceous Enaliornis. The majority of hesperornithean species are known from the Late Cretaceous of North America. Small hesperornithean bones are known from the freshwater deposits of the Late Cretaceous of the Judith River Group as well as the Hell Creek and Lance Formations, and in several Eurasian sites. These species were about the size of a cormorant or a loon. Classification The clade Hesperornithes was originally named as a subclass of Aves by Furbringer in 1888.F√ºrbringer, M. (1888): Untersuchungen zur Morphologie und Systematik der V√∂gel (2 vols). Von Holkema, Amsterdam. However, it was generally ignored in the scientific literature in favor of the order-level name Hesperornithiformes, coined one year later. In 2004, Clarke became the first to define the hesperornithean group in terms of phylogenetics. Clarke defined Hesperornithes as all species closer to Hesperornis regalis than to modern birds, and regarded Hesperornithiformes as a junior synonym, though she did not define the latter name. Clarke also defined the more inclusive group Hesperornithidae as all hesperornitheans closer to Hesperornis than to Baptornis. Hesperornitheans were originally combined with Ichthyornis in the paraphyletic group \\"Odontornithes\\" by Othniel Charles Marsh, in 1873. In 1875, they were separated as Odontolcae. The group was often considered to be related to loons and grebes, or to the Paleognathae (based on perceived similarities in the bony palate).

In 1999, Digium's founder Mark Spencer created Asterisk, the open source software project that can be used to turn a personal computer into a communications server or Voice over IP (VoIP) phone system. Today, Digium's core business lines include Switchvox, the Asterisk-based VoIP business phone system, Digium IP phones, and Asterisk telephony software and hardware products. Digium continues to make Asterisk available to the global development community for free at Asterisk.org. Digium, Inc. sells all of its products and services directly to businesses and consumers. It also offers its business-to-business communications products, including Digium Cloud Services, through a worldwide network of resellers. History In 1999, while a Computer Engineering student at Auburn University, Mark Spencer founded Linux Support Services (LSS). The high cost of buying a business phone system for LSS spurred him to use Linux and his programming skills to develop his own solution. He named it Asterisk, after the programming wildcard symbol and the ‚Äùstar‚Äù phone key. It enabled phone calls over the Internet, providing an alternative to hardware- dependent PBX systems at a cost as much as 80% less. Forbes Magazine characterized Asterisk's impact as ‚Äúwreaking havoc on the multibillion-dollar phone equipment business,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrupting the $7 billion market for office telecom (PBX) switches‚Äù by enabling individuals and organizations to innovate in what was previously a vendor-locked marketplace. Asterisk-based business phone systems, like Digium's Switchvox, were the first of a new generation of VoIP-based communications solutions that would emerge to compete with the telecom giants like Cisco and Avaya. Reflecting the company's shift away from Linux support to applications and enhancements for Asterisk and the development of new communications solutions, Linux Support Services was renamed Digium in 2001. Asterisk was released as open source by Spencer; today, the Asterisk Open-Source Software (OSS), the Asterisk community and forum, as well as an annual conference and expo, are all sponsored and maintained by Digium. Developers around the world continue to use Asterisk to create custom IP PBX systems, VoIP gateways, conference servers and other solutions for small and large organizations. They have also continued to enhance it, adding hundreds of features. It is estimated that Asterisk is currently being used by developers in 170 countries, is running on approximately 1MM servers, and is the foundation of communications systems for the majority of Fortune 500 companies.  Acquisition  Sangoma Technologies Corporation (TSX VENTURE: STC) announced they entered into a definitive agreement on August 23, 2018, closing August 31, 2018 Sangoma expects to pay a total purchase price of US$28 million on a debt-free and cash-free basis, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of US$24.3 million in cash and 3,943,025 Sangoma common shares (representing US$3.7 million based on a ten (10) day volume weighted average price of $1.2214 per common share). Digium generated approximately US$30 million in revenue in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, with consolidated assets (net of cash) of approximately US$11 million, no debt and a net loss of approximately US$4 million. The transaction closed and was finalized on September 5, 2018 Products and Services Digium products and services fall into four main categories: Business Phone Systems Digium offers Switchvox, a Unified Communications System powered by Asterisk, either as an on-premises solution or a cloud-based PBX solution. Switchvox Mobile extends Switchvox services to employees‚Äô mobile phones. Digium Cloud Services include Switchvox Cloud service and SIP Trunking.

Horsell is integral to H. G. Wells' classic science fiction novel The War of the Worlds, the sand pits of Horsell Common being the site of the first Martian landing. Horsell Common has since been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Another landmark is the McLaren Technology Centre, built on the northern edge of the common in the early 2000s for the McLaren Group. History Horsell was first documented in the 13th century, although the parish church of St Mary the Virgin is believed to date from the middle of the 12th century. The name probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon horig scylf, meaning \\"muddy slope\\". This may refer to the hill known as Horsell Rise now carrying the metalled track.Horsell Rise. Until the late 19th century, the village consisted of scattered cottages and farms, surrounded by fields, heathlands and nurseries. Suburban development began in the 1880s, but the village remains largely rural in character. St Mary's Church Terrain Horsell is located in northern Surrey and is surrounded by deciduous woodland.

It is an ancient burial ground, now with a Muslim section. There is a \\"memorial\\" to mark this. The common includes a bomb crater from World War II, a large, seasonal pond with a sandpit, and an open field extending to the grounds of the McLaren headquarters. It hosts a wide variety of plant and wildlife species and has the status of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The World War II Home Guard base on the common has disappeared. Several smaller institutions were evacuated here during the war.Woking's History & Heritage (curious spelling) Retrieved 20 February 2018. Schools and facilities The Anglican parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates back to the middle of the 12th century, and still retains the original doors. The church has strong links with one of the village's junior schools, Horsell C of E Junior School. The village's other schools include the Horsell Village School, built 1851, and independent school St. Andrew's School along with Woking High School, formerly Horsell High School. It is also the home of Woking and Horsell Cricket Club, whose members have included Alec and Eric Bedser. The famous twins played cricket for Surrey; Alec also played with great success for England.

UNSOM has been mandated to support the preparation for the elections.  International Partners  In December 2019 the International Partners released a joint press statement urging that the future election model of Somalia should: *Respect the Constitution; *Ensure that the federal elections are held on time in late 2020/early 2021, without extension of the terms of the Executive or Parliament; *Ensure fair representation of all Somali communities; *Afford the Somali people the opportunity to directly elect their representatives through ‚Äúone person, one vote‚Äù; *Include a role for political parties in the elections; *Guarantee a minimum of 30 per cent representation for women in the Federal Parliament; *Enable the broadest possible participation including of internally displaced persons; *Enjoy wide support among all Somali stakeholders; *Be capable of being implemented effectively and securely and of attracting sufficient funding through application of these principles; *Result in peaceful election of leaders who have broad legitimacy, and *Respect the mandate of the National Independent Electoral Commission. International Partners include: African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), Canada, Denmark, Ethiopia, European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Italy, Kenya, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United Nations and United States. Overview During the civilian administration that existed prior to the seizure of power by the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) in 1969, there were a number of local political parties. Most notable of these early institutions was the Somali Youth League, the nation's first political organization. Upon assuming office, the Siad Barre-led SRC outlawed all extant political parties and advocated a form of scientific socialism inspired by Maoist China and the Soviet Union. Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 that saw the ouster of the Barre regime, many of the few remaining political parties gave way to autonomous or semi-autonomous regional states in the northern part of the country, or fragmented into feuding militia groups in the south. After several unsuccessful national reconciliation efforts, a Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2004 with a mandate leading toward the establishment of a new constitution and a transition to a representative government. Post-transition In June 2011, the mandates of President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the Parliament Speaker Sharif Adan Sharif Hassan and Deputies were extended until August 2012, after which point new elections were to be organized.Somalia: PM Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo resigns As part of the official \\"Roadmap for the End of Transition\\", Somali government officials met in the northeastern town of Garowe in February 2012 to discuss post-transition arrangements. After extensive deliberations attended by regional actors and international observers, the conference ended in a signed agreement between President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Speaker of Parliament Sharif Adan Sharif Hassan, Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamed Farole, Galmudug President Mohamed Ahmed Alim and Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'a representative Khalif Abdulkadir Noor stipulating that: :a) a new 225 member bicameral parliament would be formed, consisting of an upper house seating 54 Senators as well as a lower house; :b) 30% of the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) is earmarked for women; :c) the President is to be appointed via a constitutional election; and :d) the Prime Minister is selected by the President and he/she then names his/her Cabinet.Somalia: Garowe conference comes to a close Second Garowe Conference Concludes The 2016/2017 election was an improvement on previous elections where many votes were bought, but it was still by indirect suffrage. The last one-person-one-vote election in Somalia was in 1969 and the resulting government did not last the year. Under Halima Ismail Ibrahim and the National Independent Electoral Commission another one person one vote election was supposed to take place at a cost of $53 million in 2020/2021. In August 2020, after the summit in Dhusamareb, attended by the President of Somalia, three state leaders and the mayor of Mogadishu, an election model based on constituency caucuses was agreed on. As part of the agreement, each caucus of 303 delegates will elect an MP who will get a seat in parliament, and the MPs will then elect a president. Puntland and Jubbaland leaders were not part of the deal that was reached in Dhusamareb as they did not attend the summit. The deal still has to be approved by the Lower House (House of the People) of Parliament, however.

In this episode, a struggling colony on a distant planet awaits the arrival of a ship that will take them back to Earth. The story centers around the resulting cross-cultural encounter and the enduring ties to one's home planet, chiefly as seen through the eyes of the colony's leader, William Benteen (played by James Whitmore). Opening narration Plot In 1991, 113 people built a settlement on the desert planet V9-Gamma, hoping to escape the frequent wars on Earth. However, life proved difficult under the perpetual heat and daylight of two suns, so in 2021 the settlers sent out a transmission requesting transport back to Earth. The group's leader, Captain Benteen, was 15 when the expedition left Earth. Through firm authority, ardent faith, and willingness to make tough decisions, he has kept the group of (now) 187 men, women and children from descending into anarchy, giving up hope, or falling victim to the planet's hazards, including overheating, dehydration, and meteor showers. Life is very hard and suicide is not uncommon. Following the discovery of another one, a young woman who has hanged herself, they bury her, and Benteen delivers a stern sermon and lecture. A meteor shower forces them into the main cave, and he's again asked to tell stories about home. The settlers, most of whom were born on V9-Gamma, hang on his every word when he tells them about Earth. Six months after the transmission, a rescue mission from Earth arrives, led by Colonel Sloane. Sloane tells them they have three days to prepare for their journey home. The settlers are jubilant. However, Benteen and Sloane soon begin butting heads. Benteen is upset to see that his power over the settlers is already dwindling; they are entranced by Sloane's stories of the modern Earth and disregard Benteen's warnings when Sloane encourages them to play an impromptu game of baseball in the extreme heat. Sloane implores Benteen to relax and relinquish command of the settlers, but Benteen stubbornly refuses, insisting that as long as they are on V9-Gamma, he is in command. Sloane seeks to preserve peace by agreeing to Benteen's demand that his crew be isolated from the colonists until the day of departure. When Benteen tells Sloane that he intends to petition the US government for a land grant so that the colonists can remain together as an intentional community, Sloane is aghast at the idea and says he should discuss it with the colonists rather than assuming their approval. When he does so, Benteen learns the colonists have already made plans to settle in different states, and have no enthusiasm for his plan to stay together. Benteen accuses Sloane of bringing selfishness into the community but Sloane argues that the settlers have never had any choice but to follow Benteen's leadership and can now act for themselves. Benteen is unfazed by Sloane's words. He attempts to persuade everyone to stay on V9-Gamma by characterizing Earth as a place of violence and hardship, saying none of them belong there. Sloane, finally fed up with Benteen's stubbornness, tells the settlers that while Earth isn't a paradise, it at least will give them the opportunity to think and act for themselves. Everyone, save for Benteen, chooses to return home. Benteen, in desperation, attacks the ship with a length of pipe, only to be stopped physically by Sloane and his men. Having convinced himself of his new negative image of Earth, Benteen says that he will remain behind, alone if he must. As the colonists board the ship, Sloane and the colony's engineer, Al Baines, search for Benteen to give him one last chance to change his mind, but he hides in the cave that had sheltered his people. As the ship takes off, Benteen tells his stories of Earth to the settlers as if they are still sitting with him. Remembering the beauty of Earth, he realizes that he wants to go home. He rushes out screaming for the ship to come back, but it is too late. Benteen is now stranded on V9-Gamma for the rest of his life, completely alone. Closing narration Production notes The rescue crew's ship and uniforms were leftover props from MGM's 1956 film Forbidden Planet. Early in the episode, as Benteen and the engineer discuss trouble with the cooling unit that keeps the individual home caves cool, the boom mike can clearly be seen at the bottom of the screen. A crew member shirt, also used in the episode \\"Death Ship\\", was offered at auction in late September 2015 by Profiles in History with an estimated value of US$1,000 to $1,500, with a winning bid of US$1,600.

He is currently working as Media Adviser to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, H.E. Maria Fernanda Espinosa in New York. During his career, Seddon has worked as editor of Tribune, United Nations & Diplomatic Correspondent for Al Jazeera English and as a speechwriter and communications aide to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. In January 2016, he became Director of Communications for the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, chaired by UN Special Envoy and former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. The Commission reported to the UN Secretary- General in September 2016. He has also been an activist and parliamentary candidate with the Labour Party, and served on its National Executive Committee. Education and early life The son of a British army officer, Seddon went to Dauntsey's School, an independent co-educational boarding school in the village of West Lavington in Wiltshire. He studied Development Studies at the University of East Anglia, where in 1984 he was elected president of the Union of UEA Students. Seddon's family home is in Buckinghamshire, England, and he is a keen naturalist and gardener. Journalistic career Seddon has written for the New York Times and the Boston Globe. He has been a Diarist for the London Evening Standard and has been a frequent contributor to newspapers The Guardian, The Independent, The Times, the Daily Mail, The National (Abu Dhabi), and magazines including New Statesman, Private Eye, The Oldie, Country Life, and the website 'Big Think' (New York). Also a prolific writer for Tribune, he served as that magazine's editor from 1993 until 2004. On television, Seddon has reported for the BBC from inside Iraq, North Korea and China, as well as for Sky TV from Yemen and for Al Jazeera English from North Korea, Syria, Dr Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia and Haiti. Seddon also reported regularly from the United Nations and from the White House, and has lectured widely in North America and the UK. He became the United Nations and New York City correspondent for Al Jazeera English in 2005, having helped set up and run the first ever Aljazeera English TV New York Bureau. He later returned to the UK to continue as Aljazeera English TV's Diplomatic Correspondent. He was an early guest on Have I Got News for You, and has appeared as a commentator on numerous UK and US television and radio programmes, including Newsnight, Channel 4 News, Breakfast with Frost, The Politics Show and the Today programme. In 2003, Seddon was the first journalist to reveal that 'extraordinary rendition' had taken place in the British Indian Ocean Territory island of Diego Garcia. He repeated the claims for al Jazeera English TV, shortly before the then Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, admitted that extraordinary rendition had indeed taken place using the island of Diego Garcia. Seddon was also the first foreign reporter to broadcast live from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in 2006, soon after performing the first trans Atlantic 'live' from the United Nations in New York to Doha for al Jazeera English TV at the time of that Networks' launch. He is a former Vice President of the United Nations Correspondents Association. From 2014 to 2016, Seddon worked in the Communications and Speechwriting Unit for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. During this time he again lived in Manhattan, New York City. He subsequently became Director of Communications for the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, chaired by UN Special Envoy for Global Education and former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. In September 2017 he became an Adjunct Professor in International Relations at Columbia University, New York, in the Harriman Institute. He returned to New York in August 2018, to work as Media Adviser to the President of the UN General Assembly, 73rd Session at UN Headquarters. Political career Active in the Labour Party, Seddon worked for Gordon Brown during the 1992 General Election. After Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer, Seddon served for five years on the Chancellor's Economic Policy Commission. Seddon was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee as a Grassroots Alliance candidate in 1997, gaining the highest share of the vote. Re-elected several times, he remained an NEC member until standing down in 2005. In the 2001 General Election, Seddon ran for parliament in the safe Conservative seat of Buckingham, against future Speaker John Bercow. In 2002, he was controversially removed from the shortlist to be Labour's candidate in the Ogmore by-election. Seddon was a vocal critic of many aspects of the last Labour government in the UK, particularly over the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. He also opposed Britain's involvement in the war in Afghanistan from the outset. He backed Mayor of London Ken Livingstone's ultimately successful attempt to be readmitted to the Labour Party. In 2011 he published an autobiography, Standing for Something ‚Äì Life in the Awkward Squad about his time as a dissenter within New Labour and as a foreign TV reporter. Seddon has campaigned for justice for the Chagossians of the British Indian Ocean Territory for over twenty years.

Additional countries‚ÄîMorocco and Algeria‚Äîwere later included in the proposal, which was never implemented. Regional context The attempted merger between Tunisia and Libya took place in a historical and regional context. Maghrebi regional politics played a role embedded into the constitutions of Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria is the ideal of Maghrebi unity,Aghrout, A. & Sutton, K. (1990). Regional Economic Union in the Maghrib. The Journal of Modern African Studies, 28(1), 115 however contradicting this ideal is the competing interests of Morocco and Algeria, the region's two major powers. According to Tunisian scholar Habib Slim, \\"if there were only Algeria and not Morocco, or Morocco and not Algeria, there could never have been a Maghrib. The major power would have swallowed us all up. To have the Maghrib you need those two rival powers competing with each other in the region\\".Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. Middle East Journal, 43(1), 22 Thus attempts at unification within the Maghrib were more often than not the means by which to counterbalance one or both of the region's major powers. Additionally, Pan-Arabism influenced the politics of the Arab world. Muammar Gaddafi was a well-known proponent of this ideology and had thus worked to achieve union with several Arab states such as Egypt, Syria, Sudan and Tunisia. He also sought union with Chad. Tunisia was initially suspicions of Gaddafi's intentions, but the Libyan leader visited Tunis in February 1971 and December 1972,Wright, J. 2008. The Emergence of Libya. London: Silphium Press, 344-5 and, in a rally in that city during the latter visit, spoke of supporting a union between Libya and Tunisia.Wright, J. 1981. Libya: A Modern History. London: Croom Helm, 165 Hearing the speech by Gaddafi live at his home over the radio, President Bourguiba rushed to the rally where, after he let Gaddafi finish, he took to the stage and denounced the idea that \\"the Arabs had ever been united, dismissed all of [Gaddafi's] ideas about rapid Arab unity, and even took the Libyans to task for what he described as their own lack of national unity and their backwardness\\". Close Libyan-Egyptian ties troubled Maghrebi leaders who feared the proximity of Egypt on their eastern borders and thus worked to pull Libya away from Egyptian influence.Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities, Unions and Mergers. Middle East Journal, 43(1), 23 At the fourth annual Non-Aligned Movement conference in Algiers, Bourguiba called for the unification of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya to form a \\"United States of North Africa\\", a move which he qualified by proposing it take place in stages over an \\"unspecified period of time\\".Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. Middle East Journal, 43(1), 24Africa research bulletin: economic, financial and technical series, Volume 10, 1973 Djerba Declaration On 11 January 1974, the Djerba Declaration was signed by Bourgiba and Gaddafi, which committed the two states to becoming a single state, to be named the Arab Islamic Republic.Simons, G. 1993. Libya: The struggle for Survival. New York: St. Martin's Press, 253 The agreement was signed on the Island of Djerba and thus, is also known as the Djerba Declaration or the Djerba Accord. Referendums were scheduled in each country to vote on the issue. The spontaneous tactic in trying to gain unity with another state on the part of Gaddafi displays a different approach than the previous union attempt with Egypt, where long negotiations did not work out.Wright, J. 1981. Libya: A Modern History. London: Croom Helm, 165. It is possible that Bourguiba was the original pursuant of a union between Libya and Tunisia, as Bourguiba wanted a regional ally and also wanted to \\"wean Libya away from Egypt\\".Deeb, M. J. \\"Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\\" in The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa. 4th ed. David E. Long and Bernard Reich eds. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 386. Google Books (April 4, 2008). The union agreement was a surprise to observers, as previously it was thought that Bourguiba had not supported the idea, in part due to tensions brought about by the speech by Gaddafi in Tunis in December 1972. This change in support could also have been influenced by the presence of 30,000 Tunisians working in Libya at the time and helping the Tunisian economy.Simons, G. 1993. Libya: The struggle for Survival. New York: St. Martin's Press, 253. As Tunisia suffered from a labour surplus, a foreign debt of one billion and a lack of natural resources, a closer economic union with the resource rich but labour poor Libya would have been an attractive alternative.Broken Engagement, January 28, 1974, Time Magazine, Time.com Why Bourguiba decided to agree to the union is not completely known, but it is known that the Djerba agreement was seen with suspicion by Tunisians and Algerians, as well as outside these states both regionally and internationally. The Arab Islamic Republic was supposed to have \\"a single constitution, a single army, and a single President.\\"Simons, G. 1993. Libya: The struggle for Survival. New York: St. Martin's Press, 253. Under the agreement, Bourguiba was to be President, but Gaddafi wanted to keep the Ministry of Defence.El-Kikhia, M. O. 1997. Libya's Qaddafi: The Politics of Contradiction. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 121 Prior to the Djerba Declaration multiple agreements dealing with singular, separate issues had previously been arranged between the two states on \\"trade, customs duties, investment, regulation for migrant workers, social security, and the creation of a joint shipping company,\\" but the agreements were not publicly noted as pursuing a union of the two states. Support for the unity beyond Bourguiba came from others within the Tunisian government, thinking that it would further benefit the Tunisian economy; the most prominent supporter was Tunisian Foreign Minister Mohammed Masmoudi. The length of time the union lasted is contentious, with one source saying it lasted one month, while another says it lasted only a single day and a third indicating it lasted a few days.El-Kikhia, M. O. 1997. Libya's Qaddafi: The Politics of Contradiction. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 21. ; Simons, G. 1993. Libya: The struggle for Survival. New York: St. Martin's Press, 254. ; Wright, J. 1981. Libya: A Modern History. London: Croom Helm, 166. What is known though is that Tunisia reconsidered the deal soon after signing it, as Tunisia was supportive of economic benefits gained from the union, but not for giving up Tunisian sovereignty.Simons, G. 1993. Libya: The struggle for Survival. New York: St. Martin's Press, 254. Thus, as the Tunisian Socialist Destour Party resisted the union plans due to their view that the arrangement was not clear enough and did not include how political institutions would be structured, Bourguiba rescinded on his decision to form the Arab Islamic Republic. The referendum in Tunisia was postponed, as announced on January 12, 1974. Following Bourguiba's removal of Tunisia from the agreement, the biggest supporter of the union, Tunisian Foreign Minister Masmoudi was fired. Before the agreement was dissolved, Gaddafi had thought that one merger within the region would lead to regional unification and ultimately unification of the Arab world.Wright, J. 1981. Libya: A Modern History. London: Croom Helm, 166. Following the union's inception and fallout, Bourguiba's judgement and capacity to lead Tunisia was questioned after he announced the union with Libya.Borowiec, A. 1998. Modern Tunisia: A Democratic Apprenticeship. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 34. Bechir Ben Yahmed, a Tunisian journalist noted, \\"For me, he [Bourguiba] died in January, 1974, in Djerba, when during several minutes of face-to-face with Gaddafi, he signed, on hotel stationary, that famous charter of union.\\"Borowiec, A. 1998. Modern Tunisia: A Democratic Apprenticeship. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 34 Failure of the Djerba Declaration As a consequence of the ideological differences, there was also a considerable divergence as to what the merger would look like. As understood by Bourguiba, the states themselves would not dissipate, but rather their borders would become \\"cooperatively permeable\\" through \\"functional integration,\\"Zartman, I. W. (1987). Foreign Relations of North Africa. International Affairs in Africa (Jan), 18. in a similar manner to the contemporary Arab Maghrib Union, formed over a decade later. Conversely, Gaddafi was more interested in a complete merging of Libya and Tunisia into the Arab Islamic Republic. He saw Libya as a revolutionary movement rather than a territorial state. Gaddafi felt that they were one people, and that the borders were only a product of the ruling elites and imperialist division by conquerors. Finally, there were the regional political difficulties. As has been mentioned before, Libyan-Egyptian relations were steadily deteriorating following 1973. In light of the reduced Egyptian threat, Algeria felt it no longer necessary and even undesirable to merge with Libya and was not in favour of Tunisia doing so either.Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. Middle East Journal, 43(1), 26. Thus, within twenty four hours of the Republic's announcement, Algeria threatened Tunisia with military intervention if Tunisia went ahead with the unification.Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. Middle East Journal, 43(1), 25 There were also accusations of Tunisian foreign ministers being bribed by Libya. Whatever the case may be, the unification with Libya never ended up happening and relations between the two countries steadily deteriorated.

After studying at Basel and G√∂ttingen, he was successively pastor at Schaffhausen (1841), professor of theology at Basel (1849); and at Heidelberg professor of theology (1851), director of the seminary and university preacher. At first inclined to conservatism, he afterwards became an exponent of the mediating theology (), and ultimately a liberal theologian and advanced critic. This in turn cites: * Herzog-Hauck, Realencyklop√§die * Otto Pfleiderer, Development of Theology (1890) * F. Lichtenberger, History of German Theology (1889) Associating himself with the \\"German Protestant Union\\" (), he defended the community's claim to autonomy, the cause of universal suffrage in the church and the rights of the laity. From 1852 to 1859 he edited the Allgemeine Kirchenzeitung, and from 1861 to 1872 the Allgemeine Kirchliche Zeitschrift, which he had founded in 1859. In 1867, with a view to popularizing the researches and results of the Liberal school, he undertook the editorship of a Bibel-Lexicon (5 vols, 1869-1875), a work which was so much in advance of its time that it is still useful. In his Das Wesen des Protestantismus aus den Quellen des Reformationszeitalters beleuchtet (3 vols. 1846-1851, 2nd ed. 1862), he declares that Protestantism is a principle which is always living and active, and not something which was realized once and for all in the past. He contends that the task of his age was to struggle against the Catholic principle which had infected Protestant theology and the church. In his Christliche Dogmatik (2 vols, 1858‚Äì1859) he argues that the record of revelation is human and was historically conditioned: it can never be absolutely perfect; and that inspiration, though originating directly with God, is continued through human instrumentality. His Charakterbild Jesu (1864, 4th ed. 1873; Engl. trans. from 3rd ed., 1869), which appeared almost simultaneously with David Friedrich Strauss' Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet (T√ºbingen, 1835-1836), met with fierce opposition. The work is considered too subjective and fanciful, the great fault of the author being that he lacks the impartiality of objective historical insight. Yet, as Pfleiderer says, the work \\"is full of a passionate enthusiasm for the character of Jesus.\\" The author rejects all the miracles except those of healing, and these he explains psychologically. His main purpose was to modernize and reinterpret Christianity; he says in the preface to the third edition of the book: \\"I have written it solely in the service of evangelical truth, to win to the truth those especially who have been most unhappily alienated from the church and its interests, in a great measure through the fault of a reactionary party, blinded by hierarchical aims.\\" Schenkel died in Heidelberg.

It is one of the few major tunnel fires involving a cargo normally considered to be highly flammable, namely gasoline. At the time of the fire, the Caldecott tunnel complex consisted of three bores side-by-side, each . The then- northernmost bore, where the fire occurred, is dedicated to westbound traffic, traveling from Orinda to Oakland. It has a slope of approximately 4.7%, going downhill from the entry portal to the exit portal. Description of events Shortly after midnight, a westbound driver drifted out of lane; she was later ruled to have been legally drunk at the time. Her car struck the tunnel wall, stopping in the left-hand (fast) lane almost halfway through the tunnel. The driver got out to inspect the damage. The initial crash created a bottleneck for traffic coming up behind. However due to the late hour of the crash, there were few other vehicles on the road, generally traveling at high speed. A few minutes later, a double tanker (fixed tank plus a trailer-tanker) carrying gasoline arrived at the bottleneck. By chance, there was an empty bus following close behind it. The tanker hit the car, and then braked to a halt almost exactly halfway through the tunnel. The bus hit either the car, the tanker or both; the bus driver was thrown clear of his vehicle and killed. The bus continued driverless along the tunnel and crashed into a bridge column not far outside the exit portal. The driver of the tanker investigated the state of his rig; it was clearly unable to move, the trailer tanker was leaking gasoline into the gutters, and small fires had started around the leaks. He ran downhill and made it safely out of the exit portal of the tunnel. By this time, burning gasoline from the punctured tanker was flowing down the drainage system. The natural draft in the tunnel (and the 4.7% gradient) acted as a chimney encouraging the smoke to flow uphill towards the oncoming vehicles and out of the (eastern) entrance portal. The tunnel ventilation system, which was not switched on at the time of the crash, remained off throughout the event except for a brief period when the level of carbon monoxide exceeded the trigger level. Approximately 20 vehicles entered the tunnel during the next few minutes. Most drivers managed to reverse out, prompted by the smoke moving towards them. However, four vehicles were trapped behind the burning tanker: a private car, a beer truck and two pickups. The two occupants of the vehicle closest to the fire (one of the pickups) began to reverse out, but soon left their vehicle and walked back uphill to warn the road users behind them. Approximately five minutes after the initial crash, one of these pedestrians called for help at one of the emergency telephones. Shortly afterwards, the fire suddenly increased in size and she was overcome by smoke; the tape recording of the call is blank. Farther east, the occupant of the other pickup left his vehicle and ran out of the entrance portal. The two elderly occupants of a private car were overcome by smoke without ever leaving their vehicle. The two occupants of the beer truck were also overcome by smoke, and collapsed and died as they stepped out of the truck cab. In total, two people died in the initial crash(es), five were killed by the smoke and fire, and two were hospitalized for smoke inhalation. All others escaped unharmed. Unknown to the people fleeing east in the tunnel, there were safe passages at intervals between the tubes; these might have enabled some victims to escape from the fire and smoke, but none of the unlocked doors available were used. Casualties Killed * Janice Ferris (driver of the first stopped car) * John Dykes (driver of the bus) * June Rutledge (on emergency telephone when a fireball occurred) * Everett Kidney (in the beer truck) * Melvin Young (in the beer truck) * Katherine Lenz and George Lenz (stayed in their car) Injured * Steve Rutledge (in the pickup closest to the fire) * Paul Petroelje (in the other pickup) Emergency response The Caldecott tunnel complex has a permanently manned control room, and the vibrations from the initial crash were felt by those within it. The operator could also see the bus on closed- circuit TV when it emerged from the tunnel and crashed into the column. Crews were dispatched from two local fire departments, Orinda and Oakland. Emergency services at the entry (eastern) portal took charge of those evacuated from the tunnel, while the emergency services at the exit portal were able to walk uphill to within a few tens of yards of the fire. The first concern of the firefighters was to ensure that the gasoline running down the drainage system did not pose an explosion hazard to their firefighting efforts. Unfortunately the valves that should have been used to divert the drainage outfall to a hazardous materials sump were corroded and non-functional, and the gasoline went into a nearby lake. Firefighting at the site in the tunnel began at 1:30 am once the potentially explosive atmosphere at the lake was under control. However, the heat of the fire had seriously affected the integrity of the tunnel firemain, and the water pressure was insufficient to support a hose stream. In the absence of an effective means of fighting it, the fire was allowed to burn out and the remnants were extinguished with foam and dry powder. The Stop message was issued at 2:54 am. Extent of damage The fire burned for between twenty-eight and forty minutes, and during this time most of the of gasoline carried by the truck were consumed. About ) were either discharged into the drainage or recovered from the tanker. All the heat and smoke from the fire went uphill towards the eastern entry portal. There was no fire damage west (downhill) of the fire site. Brass vehicle components at the tanker melted, indicating that temperatures were over , but no examples of melted copper (melting point ) were identified during the clean-up operations, indicating that maximum temperature range remained between those two points. The tiles and grout on the walls of the tunnel were damaged and spalled by intense heat all the way to the entrance portal, . Over the first east of the fire site, there was spalling of the concrete false ceiling and of the concrete walls behind the tiles. Spalling stopped at the steel reinforcement bars, approximately below the concrete surface. Over the first , the steel blanking plates over the ventilation flues in the false ceiling (these blanking plates are used to balance the air supply and extract rates) were buckled by heat and had to be replaced. The tunnel's wall tiles, water pipes, lighting, communications, signage and emergency panels had to be replaced throughout the east portion of the tunnel. The ceiling tiles had previously been removed due to poor adhesion. As part of the reconstruction project, enameled metal panels were used to cover the ceiling concrete. The third tube of the tunnel was closed for repairs lasting a period of months; costs of the reconstruction project totaled more than $3 million.

Interactions between electromagnetic radiation and ionized gas have been extensively studied for many purposes, including concealing aircraft from radar as stealth technology. Various methods might plausibly be able to form a layer or cloud of plasma around a vehicle to deflect or absorb radar, from simpler electrostatic or radio frequency discharges to more complex laser discharges. It is theoretically possible to reduce RCS in this way, but it may be very difficult to do so in practice. Some Russian systems e.g. the 3M22 Zircon (SS-N-33) missile have been reported to make use of plasma stealth. First claims In 1956, Arnold Eldredge, of General Electric, filed a patent application for an \\"Object Camouflage Method and Apparatus,\\" which proposed using a particle accelerator in an aircraft to create a cloud of ionization that would \\"...refract or absorb incident radar beams.\\" It is unclear who funded this work or whether it was prototyped and tested. U.S. Patent 3,127,608 was granted in 1964. During Project OXCART, the operation of the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft, the CIA funded an attempt to reduce the RCS of the A-12's inlet cones. Known as Project KEMPSTER, this used an electron beam generator to create a cloud of ionization in front of each inlet. The system was flight tested but was never deployed on operational A-12s or SR-71s.The U-2's Intended Successor: Project Oxcart 1956-1968, approved for release by the CIA in October 1994. Retrieved: 26 January 2007. In 1992, Hughes Research Laboratory conducted a research project to study electromagnetic wave propagation in unmagnetized plasma. A series of high voltage spark gaps were used to generate UV radiation, which creates plasma via photoionization in a waveguide. Plasma filled missile radomes were tested in an anechoic chamber for attenuation of reflection. At about the same time, R. J. Vidmar studied the use of atmospheric pressure plasma as electromagnetic reflectors and absorbers. Other investigators also studied the case of a non-uniform magnetized plasma slab.Laroussi, M. and Roth, J. R ‚ÄúNumerical calculation of the reflection, absorption, and transmission of microwaves by a non-uniform plasma slab‚Äù, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 21, 366 (1993) Despite the apparent technical difficulty of designing a plasma stealth device for combat aircraft, there are claims that a system was offered for export by Russia in 1999. In January 1999, the Russian ITAR-TASS news agency published an interview with Doctor Anatoliy Koroteyev, the director of the Keldysh Research Center (FKA Scientific Research Institute for Thermal Processes), who talked about the plasma stealth device developed by his organization. The claim was particularly interesting in light of the solid scientific reputation of Dr. Koroteyev and the Institute for Thermal Processes, which is one of the top scientific research organizations in the world in the field of fundamental physics.Nikolay Novichkov.Russian scientists created revolutionary technologies for reducing radar visibility of aircraft. \\"ITAR-TASS\\", January 20, 1999. The Journal of Electronic Defense reported that \\"plasma-cloud-generation technology for stealth applications\\" developed in Russia reduces an aircraft's RCS by a factor of 100 (20 dB). According to this June 2002 article, the Russian plasma stealth device has been tested aboard a Sukhoi Su-27IB fighter-bomber. The Journal also reported that similar research into applications of plasma for RCS reduction is being carried out by Accurate Automation Corporation (Chattanooga, Tennessee) and Old Dominion University (Norfolk, Virginia) in the U.S.; and by Dassault Aviation (Saint-Cloud, France) and Thales (Paris, France).Fiszer, Michal and Jerzy Gruszczynski. \\"Russia Working on Stealth Plasma\\". Journal of Electronic Defense, June 2002.  Plasma and its properties  A plasma is a quasineutral (total electrical charge is close to zero) mix of ions (atoms which have been ionized, and therefore possess a net positive charge), electrons, and neutral particles (un-ionized atoms or molecules). Most plasmas are only partially ionized, in fact, the ionization degree of common plasma devices like fluorescent lamp is fairly low ( less than 1%). Almost all the matter in the universe is very low density plasma: solids, liquids and gases are uncommon away from planetary bodies. Plasmas have many technological applications, from fluorescent lighting to plasma processing for semiconductor manufacture. Plasmas can interact strongly with electromagnetic radiation: this is why plasmas might plausibly be used to modify an object's radar signature. Interaction between plasma and electromagnetic radiation is strongly dependent on the physical properties and parameters of the plasma, most notably the electron temperature and plasma density. *Characteristic electron plasma frequency, the frequency with which electrons oscillate (plasma oscillation): :\\\\omega_{pe} = (4\\\\pi n_ee^2/m_e)^{1/2} = 5.64 \\\\times 10^4 n_e^{1/2} \\\\mbox{rad/s} = 9000 \\\\times n_e^{1/2} \\\\mbox{Hz} Plasmas can have a wide range of values in both temperature and density; plasma temperatures range from close to absolute zero and to well beyond 109 kelvins (for comparison, tungsten melts at 3700 kelvins), and plasma may contain less than one particle per cubic metre. Electron temperature is usually expressed as electronvolt (eV), and 1 eV is equivalent to 11,604 K. Common plasmas temperature and density in fluorescent light tubes and semiconductor manufacturing processes are around several eV and 109-12per cm3. For a wide range of parameters and frequencies, plasma is electrically conductive, and its response to low-frequency electromagnetic waves is similar to that of a metal: a plasma simply reflects incident low- frequency radiation. Low-frequency means it is lower than the characteristic electron plasma frequency. The use of plasmas to control the reflected electromagnetic radiation from an object (Plasma stealth) is feasible at suitable frequency where the conductivity of the plasma allows it to interact strongly with the incoming radio wave, and the wave can either be absorbed and converted into thermal energy, or reflected, or transmitted depending on the relationship between the radio wave frequency and the characteristic plasma frequency. If the frequency of the radio wave is lower than the plasma frequency, it is reflected. if it is higher, it is transmitted. If these two are equal, then resonance occurs. There is also another mechanism where reflection can be reduced. If the electromagnetic wave passes through the plasma, and is reflected by the metal, and the reflected wave and incoming wave are roughly equal in power, then they may form two phasors. When these two phasors are of opposite phase they can cancel each other out. In order to obtain substantial attenuation of radar signal, the plasma slab needs adequate thickness and density. Plasmas support a wide range of waves, but for unmagnetised plasmas, the most relevant are the Langmuir waves, corresponding to a dynamic compression of the electrons. For magnetised plasmas, many different wave modes can be excited which might interact with radiation at radar frequencies.  Plasmas on aerodynamic surfaces  Plasma layers around aircraft have been considered for purposes other than stealth. There are many research papers on the use of plasma to reduce aerodynamic drag. In particular, electrohydrodynamic coupling can be used to accelerate air flow near an aerodynamic surface. One paper considers the use of a plasma panel for boundary layer control on a wing in a low-speed wind tunnel. This demonstrates that it is possible to produce a plasma on the skin of an aircraft. Radioactive xenon nuclear poison or polonium isotopes when successfully suspended in generated plasma layers or doped into vehicle hulls, may be utilized in order for a reduction in radar cross-section by generating a plasma layer on the surface. If tunable this could shield against HMP/EMP and HERF weaponry or act as optical radiation pressure actuators. Boeing filed a series of patents related to the concept of plasma stealth. In US 7,744,039 B2, Jun. 2010, a system to control air flow with electrical pulses is described.

In US 8,220,753 B2 Jul. 2012, a system for controlling airflow on wing surface with pulsed discharge is described.  Absorption of EM radiation  When electromagnetic waves, such as radar signals, propagate into a conductive plasma, ions and electrons are displaced as a result of the time varying electric and magnetic fields. The wave field gives energy to the particles. The particles generally return some fraction of the energy they have gained to the wave, but some energy may be permanently absorbed as heat by processes like scattering or resonant acceleration, or transferred into other wave types by mode conversion or nonlinear effects. A plasma can, at least in principle, absorb all the energy in an incoming wave, and this is the key to plasma stealth. However, plasma stealth implies a substantial reduction of an aircraft's RCS, making it more difficult (but not necessarily impossible) to detect. The mere fact of detection of an aircraft by a radar does not guarantee an accurate targeting solution needed to intercept the aircraft or to engage it with missiles. A reduction in RCS also results in a proportional reduction in detection range, allowing an aircraft to get closer to the radar before being detected. The central issue here is frequency of the incoming signal. A plasma will simply reflect radio waves below a certain frequency (characteristic electron plasma frequency). This is the basic principle of short wave radios and long-range communications, because low-frequency radio signals bounce between the Earth and the ionosphere and may therefore travel long distances. Early-warning over-the-horizon radars utilize such low-frequency radio waves (typically lower than 50 MHz). Most military airborne and air defense radars, however, operate in VHF, UHF, and microwave band, which have frequencies higher than the characteristic plasma frequency of ionosphere, therefore microwave can penetrate the ionosphere and communication between the ground and communication satellites demonstrates is possible. (Some frequencies can penetrate the ionosphere). Plasma surrounding an aircraft might be able to absorb incoming radiation, and therefore reduces signal reflection from the metal parts of the aircraft: the aircraft would then be effectively invisible to radar at long range due to weak signals received. A plasma might also be used to modify the reflected waves to confuse the opponent's radar system: for example, frequency-shifting the reflected radiation would frustrate Doppler filtering and might make the reflected radiation more difficult to distinguish from noise. Control of plasma properties like density and temperature is important for a functioning plasma stealth device, and it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the plasma density, temperature, or combinations, or the magnetic field, in order to effectively defeat different types of radar systems. The great advantage Plasma Stealth possesses over traditional radio frequency stealth techniques like shape morphing into LO geometry and use of radar-absorbent materials is that plasma is tunable and wideband. When faced with frequency hopping radar, it is possible, at least in principle, to change the plasma temperature and density to deal with the situation. The greatest challenge is to generate a large area or volume of plasma with good energy efficiency. Plasma stealth technology also faces various technical problems. For example, the plasma itself emits EM radiation, although it is usually weak and noise-like in spectrum. Also, it takes some time for plasma to be re- absorbed by the atmosphere and a trail of ionized air would be created behind the moving aircraft, but at present there is no method to detect this kind of plasma trail at long distance. Thirdly, plasmas (like glow discharges or fluorescent lights) tend to emit a visible glow: this is not compatible with overall low observability concept. However, present optical detection devices like FLIR has a shorter range than radar, so Plasma Stealth still has an operational range space. Last but not least, it is extremely difficult to produce a radar-absorbent plasma around an entire aircraft traveling at high speed, the electrical power needed is tremendous. However, a substantial reduction of an aircraft's RCS may be still be achieved by generating radar- absorbent plasma around the most reflective surfaces of the aircraft, such as the turbojet engine fan blades, engine air intakes, vertical stabilizers, and airborne radar antenna. There have been several computational studies on plasma-based radar cross section reduction technique using three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations. Chaudhury et al. studied the electromagnetic wave attenuation of an Epstein profile plasma using this method. Chung studied the radar cross change of a metal cone when it is covered with plasma, a phenomenon that occurs during reentry into the atmosphere. Chung simulated the radar cross section of a generic satellite, and also the radar cross section when it is covered with artificially generated plasma cones.  Theoretical work with Sputnik  Due to the obvious military applications of the subject, there are few readily available experimental studies of plasma's effect on the radar cross section (RCS) of aircraft, but plasma interaction with microwaves is a well explored area of general plasma physics. Standard plasma physics reference texts are a good starting point and usually spend some time discussing wave propagation in plasmas. One of the most interesting articles related to the effect of plasma on the RCS of aircraft was published in 1963 by the IEEE. The article is entitled \\"Radar cross sections of dielectric or plasma coated conducting spheres and circular cylinders\\" (IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, September 1963, pp. 558-569). Six years earlier, in 1957, the Soviets had launched the first artificial satellite. While trying to track Sputnik it was noticed that its electromagnetic scattering properties were different from what was expected for a conductive sphere. This was due to the satellite's traveling inside of a plasma shell: the ionosphere. The Sputnik's simple shape serves as an ideal illustration of plasma's effect on the RCS of an aircraft. Naturally, an aircraft would have a far more elaborate shape and be made of a greater variety of materials, but the basic effect should remain the same. In the case of the Sputnik flying through the ionosphere at high velocity and surrounded by a naturally occurring plasma shell, there are two separate radar reflections: the first from the conductive surface of the satellite, and the second from the dielectric plasma shell. The authors of the paper found that a dielectric (plasma) shell may either decrease or increase the echo area of the object. If either one of the two reflections is considerably greater, then the weaker reflection will not contribute much to the overall effect. The authors also stated that the EM signal that penetrates the plasma shell and reflects off the object's surface will drop in intensity while traveling through plasma, as was explained in the prior section. The most interesting effect is observed when the two reflections are of the same order of magnitude. In this situation the two components (the two reflections) will be added as phasors and the resulting field will determine the overall RCS. When these two components are out of phase relative to each other, cancellation occurs. This means that under such circumstances the RCS becomes null and the object is completely invisible to the radar. It is immediately apparent that performing similar numeric approximations for the complex shape of an aircraft would be difficult. This would require a large body of experimental data for the specific airframe, properties of plasma, aerodynamic aspects, incident radiation, etc. In contrast, the original computations discussed in this paper were done by a handful of people on an IBM 704 computer made in 1956, and at the time, this was a novel subject with very little research background. So much has changed in science and engineering since 1963, that differences between a metal sphere and a modern combat jet pale in comparison. A simple application of plasma stealth is the use of plasma as an antenna: metal antenna masts often have large radar cross sections, but a hollow glass tube filled with low pressure plasma can also be used as an antenna, and is entirely transparent to radar when not in use.

He is heralded as the founder of the science of international law alongside Francisco de Vitoria and Hugo Grotius, and thus known as the \\"Father of international law\\". Gentili has been the earliest writer on public international law. In 1587, he became the first non-English person to be a Regius Professor. Gentili authored several books, which are recognized to be among the most essential for international legal doctrines, yet that also include theological and literary subjects. It was occasioned by a case on which Gentili's counsel was sought. In 1584 Gentili and Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul were asked by the government to advise on the treatment of Spanish ambassador Bernardino de Mendoza, who had been implicated in the so-called Throckmorton plot against Queen Elizabeth I. As a result, Mendoza was expelled from England. Early life and family He was born into a noble family in the town of San Ginesio, Macerata, Italy. It has been conjectured that Gentili's mother might have been the source of his early love for jurisprudence, but it was his father, Matteo Gentili, a renowned physician, who assumed the role of his tutor in Latin and Greek. He obtained a doctoral degree in law at the University of Perugia at the age of 20. Career After his graduation, he was elected as the chief judge of Ascoli, but he then settled in his native town, where he filled various responsible offices. Both father and son belonged to a confraternity suspected of meeting for the discussion of opinions hostile to the Roman church. The Inquisition was upon the track of the heretics, and Gentili, together with his father and one of his brothers, Scipione Gentili, were forced to leave Italy because of their Protestant beliefs. The three first went to Ljubljana (German: Laibach), now in Slovenia, the capital of the duchy of Carniola. From there, Alberico went on to the German university towns of T√ºbingen and Heidelberg. At their first halting place, Ljubljana, Matteo, doubtless through the influence of his brother-in-law, Nicolo Petrelli, a jurist high in favour with the court, was appointed chief physician for the duchy of Carniola. In the meantime, the papal authorities had excommunicated the fugitives and soon procured their expulsion from Austrian territory. Early in 1580, Alberico set out for England, preceded by a reputation that procured him offers of professorships at Heidelberg and at T√ºbingen, where Scipio was left to commence his university studies. Alberico reached London in August, with introductions to Giovanni Battista Castiglione, the Italian tutor to Queen Elizabeth I. Gentili soon became acquainted with Dr Tobia Matthew, the Archbishop of York. On 14 January 1581, Gentili was accordingly incorporated from Perugia as a D.C.L. giving Gentili the right of teaching law, which he first exercised in St John's College, Oxford. Subsequently, Gentili was appointed as the Regius professor of civil law at Oxford University by the Chancellor of Oxford University, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester.Adams, Simon (ed.): Household Accounts and Disbursement Books of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester Cambridge UP 1995 p. 212 He was commissioned to prepare a revised version of the statutory laws of his home town, a task which he completed in 1577. After a short stay in Wittenberg, Germany, he returned to Oxford. Gentili held the regius professorship until his death, but he turned more and more to practical work in London from about 1590. He practised in the High Court of Admiralty, where the continental civil law rather than the English common law was applied. In 1600, Gentili was called to the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. He died in London and was buried in the Church of St Helen Bishopsgate in the City of London. He married Hester de Peigne, a French Huguenot, in 1589. His eldest son was Robert Gentilis, who graduated from Oxford University at the age of 12 and was made a Fellow of All Souls College Oxford at the age of 17 through the influence of his father. Works In titulum Digestorum De verborum significatione commentarius, 1614 In 1582, Gentili published De Juris Interpretibus Dialogi Sex. This book shows Gentili as a staunch supporter of the bartolist method and an opponent of the French humanist jurists like Jacques Cujas, who applied philological methods to the sources of Roman law. Gentili's first book on issues of international law was De Legationibus Libri Tres, published in 1585. Between 1588 and 1589 Gentili published three booklets collected as De Jure Belli Commentationes Tres. An enhanced edition appeared under the title De Jure Belli Libri Tres in 1598. It is considered his main work and a classic of public international law. The book is praised for its modernity and its skillful use of civil law concepts but also for its closeness to the actual practice of international law. Gentili published De armis Romanis in two parts in 1590 and 1599. While less studied than his earlier works, De armis Romanis has been the focus of recent scholarly attention by Christopher N. Warren, Diego Panizza and others.Warren, Christopher. ‚ÄúGentili, the Poets, and the Laws of War,‚Äù in The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations: Alberico Gentili and the Justice of Empire, ed.

It was only in the 19th century that interest in Gentili revived, to a great extent because of Sir Thomas Erskine Holland (1835‚Äì1926), who, in 1874, devoted his inaugural lecture as professor of international law and diplomacy in Oxford to Gentili. Since then, numerous books and articles have been written about Gentili and his work. In his hometown, a monument was erected in his honour.

Conservative wing  The conservative wing grew out of the 1950s and 1960s in response to the growth and national prominence of the moderate wing, with its initial leaders being Senator Robert A. Taft, Russell Kirk, and William F. Buckley Jr. Its central tenets include the promotion of individual liberty and free-market economics and opposition to labor unions, high taxes, and excessive government regulation. In economic policy, conservatives call for a large reduction in government spending, free trade, less regulation of the economy, and personalized accounts for Social Security. Supporters of supply- side economics predominate, but there are deficit hawks within the faction as well. Before 1930, the Northeastern pro-manufacturing faction of the GOP was strongly committed to high tariffs, but since 1945 it has been more supportive of free-market principles and treaties for open trade. The conservative wing supports social conservatism (often termed family values) and anti-abortion positions. Conservatives generally oppose affirmative action, arguing that it too often turns into quotas. They tend to support a strong military and are opposed to gun control. They oppose illegal immigration and support stronger law enforcement, often disagreeing with strict libertarians. On the issue of school vouchers, conservative Republicans split between supporters who believe that \\"big government education\\" is a failure and opponents who fear greater government control over private and church schools. Parts of the conservative wing have been criticized for being anti-environmentalist and promoting climate change denial in opposition to the general scientific consensus, making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties. There are several subcategories within conservative Republicanism.  Christian right  The Christian right is a conservative Christian political faction characterized by strong support of socially conservative policies. Christian conservatives principally seek to apply their understanding of the teachings of Christianity to politics and to public policy by proclaiming the value of those teachings or by seeking to use those teachings to influence law and public policy.Sociology: understanding a diverse society, Margaret L. Andersen, Howard Francis Taylor, Cengage Learning, 2005, , In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics, as well as a large number of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). The movement has its roots in American politics going back as far as the 1940s and has been especially influential since the 1970s. In the late 20th century, the Christian right became a notable force in the Republican party. Politicians associated with the Christian right include former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.  Neoconservatives  President George W. Bush Neoconservatives promote an interventionist foreign policy to promote democracy. Many neoconservatives were in earlier days identified as liberals or were affiliated with the Democrats. Neoconservatives have been credited with importing into the Republican Party a more active international policy. Neoconservatives are amenable to unilateral military action when they believe it serves a morally valid purpose (such as the spread of democracy). Many of its adherents became politically famous during the Republican presidential administrations of the late 20th century, and neoconservatism peaked in influence during the administration of George W. Bush, when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration included Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, and Paul Bremer. While not identifying as neoconservatives, senior officials Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel and the promotion of American influence in the Middle East.  Paleoconservatives  Paleoconservatives stress tradition, paternalism, Judeo-Christian ethics, regionalism, and nationalism. Paleoconservatives tend towards both social and cultural conservatism and as such oppose abortion, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and civil unions. They are skeptical of modern political ideologies and critical of multiculturalism, generally favoring tight restrictions on legal immigration. Paleoconservatives are generally economically nationalist, favoring a protectionist policy on international trade. Tea Party movement Former Governor of South Carolina and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley The Tea Party movement is an American fiscally conservative political movement within the Republican Party that began in 2009 following the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Members of the movement have called for lower taxes, and for a reduction of the national debt of the United States and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending.Gallup: Tea Party's top concerns are debt, size of government The Hill, July 5, 2010Somashekhar, Sandhya (September 12, 2010). Tea Party DC March: \\"Tea party activists march on Capitol Hill\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved November 5, 2011. The movement supports small-government principles and opposes government-sponsored universal healthcare.Roy, Avik. April 7, 2012. The Tea Party's Plan for Replacing Obamacare. Forbes. Retrieved: March 6, 2015. The Tea Party movement has been described as a popular constitutional movement. The movement's name refers to the Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773, a watershed event in the launch of the American Revolution. Politicians associated with the Tea Party include former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, former U.S. Senator Jim DeMint, former U.N. Ambassador and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, U.S. Senator Mike Lee, and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.  Traditionalists  Traditionalists base their ideology upon the political philosophies of Aristotle, Edmund Burke, and Russell Kirk. They emphasize the bonds of social order over hyper-individualism and the defense of ancestral institutions. They believe in a transcendent moral order, manifested through certain natural laws to which they believe society ought to conform in a prudent manner.  Moderate & Liberal wings  Nelson Rockefeller, the namesake of the Rockefeller Republicans Moderate Republicans, particularly those from the Northeast and West Coast, were referred to as \\"The Eastern Establishment\\" or \\"Rockefeller Republicans.\\" Prominent liberal Republicans from the mid-1930s to the 1970s included: Alf Landon, Wendell Willkie, Earl Warren, Thomas Dewey, Prescott Bush, Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., George W. Romney, William Scranton, Charles Mathias, Lowell Weicker and Jacob Javits. Modern moderates have been known as \\"business conservatives\\", and Congressional moderates are members of Main Street Republicans or The Tuesday Group. Moderates tend be conservative-to-moderate on fiscal issues and moderate-to-liberal on social issues. While they sometimes share the economic views of other Republicans‚Äîe.g. balanced budgets, lower taxes, free trade, deregulation, and welfare reform‚Äîmoderate Republicans differ in that some are for affirmative action, same-sex marriage, gay adoption, legal access to and even funding for abortion, gun control laws, more environmental regulation and anti-climate change measures, fewer restrictions on legal immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and embryonic stem cell research. Prominent modern moderate Republicans include U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa and former U.S. Senator Scott Brown, and Governors Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Phil Scott of Vermont, and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire. The term South Park Republican has been used to describe people who hold center- right political beliefs, consisting of fiscally conservative and socially moderate or liberal views, influenced by the popular American animated television program South Park.  Log Cabin Republicans  The Log Cabin Republicans was founded in the 1970s in opposition to the Briggs Initiative in California. It works within the Republican Party to advocate equal rights for LGBT Americans.  Libertarian wing  Senator Rand Paul Historically known as Jeffersonian Republicans, libertarian Republicans make up a relatively small faction of the Republican Party. Libertarian Republicans in the 21st century favor cutting taxes and regulations, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and protecting gun rights.Bill Marsh, Graham Roberts, Xaquin G. V. & Archie Tse, A New Guide to the Republican Herd, New York Times (August 26, 2012). On social issues, they favor privacy, oppose the USA Patriot Act, and oppose the War on Drugs. On foreign policy, libertarian Republicans favor non-interventionism. The Republican Liberty Caucus, which describes itself as \\"the oldest continuously operating organization in the Liberty Republican movement with state charters nationwide\\", was founded in 1991.History of the RLC, Republican Liberty Caucus (accessed August 19, 2016). The House Liberty Caucus is a congressional caucus formed by Representative Justin Amash, former Republican of Michigan, now a member of the Libertarian Party (United States).Robert Drape, Has the 'Libertarian Moment' Finally Arrived?, New York Times Magazine (August 7, 2016). Other prominent libertarian Republicans include former congressman Ron Paul and U.S. Senator Rand Paul. In the 1950s and 60s, fusionism‚Äîthe combination of traditionalist and social conservatism with political and economic right-libertarianism‚Äîwas essential to the movement's growth. This philosophy is most closely associated with Frank Meyer. While the fusion of various factions within the big tent has always been critical, original fusionism saw its peak during the presidency of Ronald Reagan.  Historical factions   Half-Breeds  The Half-Breeds were a reformist faction of the 1870s and 1880s. The name, which originated with rivals claiming they were only \\"half\\" Republicans, came to encompass a wide array of figures who did not all get along with each other. Generally speaking, politicians labeled Half-Breeds were moderates or progressives who opposed the machine politics of the Stalwarts and advanced civil services reforms.  Progressive Republicans  President Theodore Roosevelt Historically, the Republican Party included a progressive wing that advocated using government to improve the problems of modern society. Theodore Roosevelt, an early leader of the progressive movement, advanced a \\"Square Deal\\" domestic program as president (1901‚Äì09) that was built on the goals of controlling corporations, protecting consumers, and conserving natural resources. After splitting with his successor, William Howard Taft, in the aftermath of the Pinchot‚ÄìBallinger controversy, Roosevelt sought to block Taft's re-election, first by challenging him for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination, and then when that failed, by entering the 1912 presidential contest as a third party candidate, running on the Progressive ticket. He succeeded in depriving Taft of a second term, but came in second behind Democrat Woodrow Wilson. After Roosevelt's 1912 defeat, the progressive wing of the party went into decline. Progressive Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives held a \\"last stand\\" protest in December 1923, at the start of the 68th Congress, when they refused to support the Republican Conference nominee for Speaker of the House, Frederick H. Gillett, voting instead for two other candidates. After eight ballots spanning two days, they agreed to support Gillett in exchange for a seat on the House Rules Committee and pledges that subsequent rules changes would be considered. On the ninth ballot, Gillett received 215 votes, a majority of the 414 votes cast, to win the election. In addition to Theodore Roosevelt, leading early progressive Republicans included Robert M. La Follette, Charles Evans Hughes, Hiram Johnson, William Borah, George W. Norris and Fiorello La Guardia.Michael Wolraich. Unreasonable Men: Theodore Roosevelt and the Republican Rebels Who Created Progressive Politics (2014).  Radical Republicans  The Radical Republicans were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877. The Radicals strongly opposed slavery, were hard-line abolitionists, and later advocated equal rights for the freedmen and women. They were often at odds with the moderate and conservative factions of the party. During the American Civil War, Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as too lenient on the Confederates. After the war's end and Lincoln's assassination, the Radicals clashed with Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction policy. After winning major victories in the 1866 congressional elections, the Radicals took over Reconstruction, pushing through new legislation protecting the civil rights of African Americans. John C. Fr√©mont of Michigan, the party's first nominee for President in 1856, was a Radical Republican. Upset with Lincoln's politics, the faction split from the Republican to form the short-lived Radical Democracy Party in 1864 and again nominated Fr√©mont for president. They supported Ulysses S. Grant for President in 1868 and 1872. As Southern Democrats retook control in the South and enthusiasm for continued Reconstruction declined, their influence within the GOP waned.  Reagan coalition  President Ronald Reagan According to historian George H. Nash, the Reagan coalition in the Republican Party originally consisted of five factions: the libertarians, the traditionalists, the anti-communists, neoconservatives, and the religious right.  Stalwarts  The Stalwarts were a traditionalist faction that existed from the 1860s through the 1880s. They represented \\"traditional\\" Republicans who favored machine politics and opposed the civil service reforms of Rutherford B. Hayes and the more progressive Half-Breeds. They declined following the elections of Hayes and James A. Garfield. After Garfield's assassination, his Stalwart Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency and rather than pursuing Stalwart goals he took up the reformist cause, which curbed the faction's influence.

It was opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. The building was designed by Leslie Green. Caledonian Road station is located on Caledonian Road in Holloway, north London. The station continues to use lifts, never having been upgraded to escalators. Unusually for stations of its era, the lifts descend directly to platform level with no secondary staircases. In recent times this has meant that the station is now advertised as \\"Step Free\\" on line maps without rebuilding work taking place. The station is a Grade II listed building. The next northbound station from Caledonian Road is Holloway Road while the next southbound station was originally York Road. This station closed in 1932, but can still be seen from trains. York Road was planned to be open to relieve congestion at King's Cross St. Pancras. Temporary closure The station was scheduled to be closed from 4 January 2016 until mid-August 2016, to enable the two lifts to be upgraded. A local campaign against the closure emerged via a Change.org petition and achieved close to 7,500 supporters. The petitioners claimed that the station could be kept open while new lifts were installed in two unused lift shafts. This was previously done when lifts were replaced in 1987 and the station remained open throughout. In January 2016, Islington Council announced that it had applied for a Judicial Review of Transport for London's plan, to be heard on 25 February 2016. On 19 January 2016, Underground management announced that the closure plan had been shelved and that new arrangements would be made to keep the station open during lift refurbishment. Service Pattern The typical off-peak service from this station is as follows: *12 tph (trains per hour) to Heathrow Airport via Central London **6 of these to terminals 4 and 1,2,3 **6 of these to terminals 1,2,3 and 5 *3 tph to Rayners Lane via Central London *3 tph to Uxbridge via Central London and Rayners Lane *3 tph to Northfields via Central London *18 tph to Cockfosters *3 tph to Arnos Grove Location The station is close to Pentonville Prison and Caledonian Park, the site of the former Victorian Metropolitan Cattle Market, is a short distance away on Market Road. Platform Level Tiling The platform at Caledonian Road showing its distinctive tilework and colours The distinctive nameplate and tilework pattern The stations along the central part of the Piccadilly line, as well as some sections of the Northern line, were financed by Charles Yerkes,http://www.londonreconnections.com/2010/the-man-who-painted- london-red/ and are famous for the Leslie Green designed red station buildings and distinctive platform tiling. Each station has its own unique tile pattern and colours.

He is often accompanied alongside by his young, diminutive, sidekick Ding-A-Ling Wolf, both of whom are featured as part of The Huckleberry Hound Show in their own segment. History The initial creation of Hokey Wolf occurred when another follow-up segment was needed, because Yogi Bear's rising popularity in preceding appearances warranted a promotion to his own self-titled show. Hokey Wolf As a result of the change in schedule, Hokey Wolf had made its debut midway through the third season of The Huckleberry Hound Show and became a regular appearance afterward on this segment. Hokey's theme music for his segment of the show was composed by Hoyt Curtin and used an instrumental version of the refrain from \\"Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here.\\"Mike's Classic Cartoon Themes ‚Äì Hokey Wolf A small Hokey Wolf web page, featuring the opening theme music in MP3 format. The segment follows the everyday misadventures of its protagonist, Hokey Wolf, and his young companion, Ding-A-Ling Wolf, through their typical con-artist routines of getting what they need in their daily lives. Through each episode, Hokey would usually try to fool different characters with food-stealing schemes and/or finding a place to stay without cost, only for most of these tricks to backfire on him in one way or another. Character information Both of the cartoon's feature characters were designed by animation artist and character designer Ed Benedict. The MegaCollector's Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling Hokey Wolf Hokey Wolf (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Phil Silvers, and Cam Clarke, 2020-present) is the smooth-talking title character throughout each cartoon. His main hobby in life was to outsmart and coax the clueless out of free meals or places to stay, much of which he seemed to do so with ease, despite possible consequences later on. Hokey typically wears his trademark green bow tie with white collar and a violet-colored hat. His personality would later be recycled for fellow Hanna-Barbera characters Top Cat who starred in a prime-time sitcom that ran from 1961 to 1962 that followed a very similar concept. Ding-A- Ling Wolf Ding-A-Ling Wolf, who is Hokey's sidekick Ding-A-Ling Wolf (voiced by Doug Young impersonating Buddy Hackett and Tom Kenny, 2020-present) is the younger sidekick to Hokey Wolf who always accompanies him throughout each misadventure. He is usually eager to follow in Hokey's ambitious con- artist footsteps, but often reconsiders the plans Hokey will come up with in many situations. Ding typically wears a bowler hat (sometimes red, sometimes black), a sleeveless green shirt, and a black vest. Original segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show In total, Hokey and Ding-A-Ling Wolf starred in 28 seven-minute cartoons throughout the third and fourth seasons (1960‚Äì1961) of The Huckleberry Hound Show. Their pilot episode was Tricks and Treats. The Hokey Wolf series would come to an end with the episode Bean Pod‚Äôners, airing on .

Further appearances Hanna- Barbera series While the initial series ended in December 1961, Hokey Wolf went on to appear in four other animated Hanna-Barbera series alongside other classic characters. These were as follows: * Yogi's Gang (1973‚Äì1975) ‚Äì Hokey was a member of the crew. * Laff-A-Lympics (1977‚Äì1979) ‚Äì Hokey Wolf played as a team member of The Yogi Yahooeys. * Yogi's Treasure Hunt (1985) ‚Äì Hokey was a regular guest star in several episodes. * Yo Yogi! (1991‚Äì1992) ‚Äì Hokey Wolf (voiced by Matt Hurwitz) co-starred as the mayor of Jellystone Town. His younger companion, Ding-A-Ling, also made a brief non-speaking cameo as Hokey's photographer in the episode \\"Super Duper Snag\\", but he has a speaking role in the episode \\"Polly Want a Safe Cracker\\" (voiced by Patric Zimmerman). Hanna-Barbera films * In the last episode of The Yogi Bear Show (1962), Hokey Wolf, along with his sidekick Ding-A-Ling, were among the guests who showed up to wish their friend Yogi Bear a happy birthday. * In the 1972 television movie Yogi's Ark Lark, both Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling appeared together as part of the gang.

It will be an underground station located underneath the existing Wan Chai North public transport interchange, Harbour Road Sports Centre and Wan Chai Swimming Pool. It will serve the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre at Wan Chai North, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. Its location is within walking distance to Wan Chai station of the Island line. The station is set to be completed in 2021 or 2022. Description The station serves the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, the Wan Chai Sports Ground, and various nearby office towers in Wan Chai North. It will be an interchange station between the North Island Line (the extension of Tseung Kwan O Line) and the North South Corridor of the Sha Tin-Central Link, offering cross-platform interchange between the two lines. Initially, only the North South Corridor platforms will be open, as the North Island Line is still under planning. The station is designed by Farrells. In January 2015, MTR awarded a contract to Leighton in a joint venture with China State Construction to construct the station and western approach tunnel. The Wan Chai Bus Terminus, where the station will be built, was relocated to newly reclaimed land and the station groundbreaking took place on the former bus station site on 20 April 2015. The station will be built on the site of the existing Harbour Road Sports Centre, Wan Chai Swimming Pool, and a bus terminus, which must all be demolished and reprovisioned elsewhere before construction shall begin. The swimming pool and sports centre are being rebuilt on the car park site immediately to the south. The bus terminus has temporarily relocated to the reclamation area near the new Wan Chai Ferry Pier. On top of the station, a Convention Centre will be built as an expansion of the nearby Convention and Exhibition Centre. The enabling works for this topside development are included during the station construction.

The station was opened in July 1998 at the same time as the airport, and served as the western terminus station of the line until the opening of the AsiaWorld-Expo station on 20 December 2005. Platform 3 was constructed opposite to platform 1 to enable access to SkyPlaza and Terminal 2. The new platform began operations on 28 February 2007, when the additional check-in facilities opened at Terminal 2. Until Terminal 2 was closed for expansion on 28 November 2019, Airport Express trains stopping at the station opened its two doors simultaneously for both platforms‚Äîdoors on the left opened for Terminal 1, and doors on the right opened for Terminal 2 and SkyPlaza.  Facilities  Due to the integration with the airport, no exit or entry gates are installed for the convenience of the travellers. Therefore, travellers can walk straight into the terminal building through the exit for their check-in procedures (if they have not completed In-Town Check- in). Ticket baskets are provided on the departure level for the travellers to dispose of their used tickets in. A souvenir shop is also found there. Although no entry gates are provided at Airport Station, travellers must still buy tickets from the ticket machines located in the Arrivals Hall or on platform 1 of the Airport Station before boarding the train. Otherwise, they may not be able to get out through the exit gates at AsiaWorld‚ÄìExpo, Tsing Yi, Kowloon or Hong Kong stations.

Control Theory Flow Chart . Control theory in sociology is the idea that two control systems‚Äîinner controls and outer controls‚Äîwork against our tendencies to deviate. Control theory can either be classified as centralized or decentralized or neither. Decentralized control is considered market control. Centralized control is considered bureaucratic control. Some types of control such as clan control are considered to be a mixture of both decentralized and centralized control. Decentralized control or market control is typically maintained through factors such as price, competition, or market share. Centralized control such as bureaucratic control is typically maintained through administrative or hierarchical techniques such as creating standards or policies. An example of mixed control is clan control which has characteristics of both centralized and decentralized control. Mixed control or clan control is typically maintained by keeping a set of values and beliefs or norms and traditions. Containment theory, as developed by Walter Reckless in 1973, states that behavior is caused not by outside stimuli, but by what a person wants most at any given time. According to the control theory, weaker containing social systems result in more deviant behavior. Control theory stresses how weak bonds between the individuals and society free people to deviate or go against the norms, or the people who have weak ties would engage in crimes so they could benefit, or gain something that is to their own interest. This is where strong bonds make deviance more costly. Deviant acts appear attractive to individuals but social bonds stop most people from committing the acts. Deviance is a result from extensive exposure to certain social situations where individuals develop behaviors that attract them to avoid conforming to social norms. Social bonds are used in control theory to help individuals from going after these attractive deviations. According to Travis Hirschi, humans are selfish beings, who make decisions based on which choice will give the greatest benefit. A good example of control theory would be that people go to work. Most people do not want to go to work, but they do, because they get paid, to obtain food, water, shelter, and clothing. Hirschi (1969) identifies four elements of social bonds: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief.

Erich Heckel (31 July 1883 in D√∂beln - 27 January 1970 in Radolfzell) was a German painter and printmaker, and a founding member of the group Die Br√ºcke (\\"The Bridge\\") which existed 1905-1913. His work was part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics.  Biography  Heckel was born in D√∂beln, Saxony, the son of a railway engineer. Between 1843 and 1904 he attended the Realgymnasium in Chemnitz, before studying architecture in Dresden. He left after three terms, shortly after the foundation of Die Br√ºcke, an artists' group of which he was secretary and treasurer. The other founder-members, also architectural students, were Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rotluff and Fritz Bleyl. He worked in the office of the architect Wilhelm Kreis until July 1907, when he resigned to become a full-time artist.  Career  Heckel met the other founding members of Die Br√ºcke, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rotluff, and Fritz Bleyl, while studying architecture in Dresden. The foursome equally regarded pursuing a degree in architecture as a compromise with their respectable middle-class parents who would have never supported them, had they wanted to study art. Heckel attended the Dresden Polytechnic Institute for only eighteen months, after which time he accepted a job as a draughtsman at Wilhem Kreis's architectural studio. He was able to use the position for the benefit of the Br√ºcke. When the firm was asked to design an exhibition room for the lamp manufacturer Max Seifert, Heckel was able to persuade the industrialist that it was worthwhile giving wall space and displays to the Brucke for an exhibition.  Art  As a member of Die Br√ºcke, Heckel often filled the role of business manager, which allowed the collective to network with other upcoming artists at the time, such as the Munich-based Franz Marc. This subsequently led to greater publicity for the collective, such as their mention in the almanac of Franz Marc's own artistic coalition, the Blaue Reiter. DPAG-2005-DieBrueckeSitzendeFraenzi It is worthwhile to note that with the exception of one favorable review by Paul Fetcher in the leading Dresden newspaper Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, the exhibition in L√∂btau at the factory of the lamp manufacturer Max Seifert was considered to be a flop. In addition, Heckel's poster, no longer extant, had been barred from public display by the Dresden police. In 1906 and 1907 the Die Br√ºcke had another exhibition in L√∂btau, devoted exclusively to graphics and including a group of woodcuts by Wassily Kandinsky. Unfortunately, the group once again failed to strike a chord with the public. However, much more noteworthy and ironically also notorious, were the next three annual shows by the Die Br√ºcke, this time held in the fashionable Emil Richter Gallery. In large, silent rooms, expensively furnished and smothered with lush carpets, the group's unconventional paintings and prints struck a foreseeably strident chord, amongst them notably a nude poster of a woman that ruffled many a complacent Dresdener. Heckel and other members of Die Br√ºcke greatly admired the work of Edvard Munch, and aimed to make a \\"bridge\\" between traditional neo-romantic German painting and modern expressionist painting. The four founding members made much use of the print as a cheap and quick medium with which to produce affordable art. Primitive art was also an inspiration to the members of the Die Br√ºcke. It was Heckel's brother who introduced the group to African sculpture, and it is noted that their acceptance of primitive art, which was to fortify decisively the expressive yearnings of European artists- Was unequivocal. It is through this style that they found a source of strength in the barbaric figures.  World War I and II  In December 1911, Erich Heckel moved from Dresden to Berlin. Die Br√ºcke was dissolved in 1913. He was classified as unfit for active service during the First World War, but volunteered to serve in an ambulance unit stationed in Belgium. He managed to continue to produce work throughout the war. Between 1922 and 1924 Heckel painted one small, arched room at the invitation of the Angermuseum on the ground floor of the museum. It is now called the Heckelraum. The mural paintings, which were subsequently given the title Lebenstufen (in English: Stages in Life), are considered to be the most important surviving wall paintings of German Expressionism. In 1937 the Nazi Party declared his work \\"degenerate\\"; it forbade him to show his work in public, and more than 700 items of his art were confiscated from German museums. By 1944 all of his woodcut blocks and print plates had been destroyed. After World War II Heckel lived at Gaienhofen near Lake Constance, teaching at the Karlsruhe Academy until 1955. He continued painting until his death at Radolfzell in 1970. Plaque commemorating Heckel in Berlin  Legacy  Like most members of Die Br√ºcke, he was a prolific printmaker: Dube's catalogues raisonn√© describe with 465 woodcuts, 375 etchings, and 400 lithographs. More than 200 of them, mostly etchings, are from the last seven years of his life. A major retrospective exhibition, Erich Heckel - His Work in the 1920s, was held October 2004 - February 2005 at the Br√ºcke Museum in Berlin. In 2000, Heckel's Dangaster Dorflandschaft (Dangast village landscape) (1909) was sold for ¬£1.21 million at Sotheby's in London.Souren Melikian (October 28, 2000), Brokerages May Alter the Art Game : Earthquakes in the Auction World International Herald Tribune. David Bowie based the cover of his 1977 album \\"Heroes\\" on Heckel's painting Roquairol. The same painting also provided the basis for the cover of Iggy Pop's 1977 album The Idiot. Critical reception The critic James Auer has said that Heckel's Franzi Standing ... > ...in many ways encapsulates the principal virtues of the entire > Expressionist movement. At once frank and respectful, daring and > compassionate, it depicts a girl-woman on the cusp of adolescence, innocent > and free yet, at the same time, curious and knowing.

In 2004 Natimuk hosted 10000 people for Triple J's One Night Stand. Description Natimuk has traditionally survived as a rural service centre for the surrounding grain and sheep farming community. More recently it has diversified into tourism and staved off the decline common in other Wimmera towns. People from all over the planet flock to Natimuk because of the rock climbing at Mount Arapiles and the nearby Grampians. Around 60 rock climbers (locally known as goats) have made Natimuk their home due to the climbing and lifestyle. Every two years Natimuk hosts its arts festival, the Nati Frinj. Natimuk's arts friendly focus has attracted and supported artists from nearby regions or urban areas to settle in the town. Sport The town has traditionally had strong Netball teams - The Ewes. Natimuk also fields three or four Australian Rules teams who compete in the Horsham & District Football League. Golfers play at the course of the Natimuk Golf Club at Mount Arapiles State Park. There is also a lawn bowls club, tennis club, cricket club and people come from miles around to compete and train with the Natimuk Gymnastics Club. Environment One of the events at the Nati Frinj There are many small wetlands in the district, and the town lies close to the Natimuk- Douglas Wetlands Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for a variety of waterbirds. Events Nati Frinj is hosted in the first weekend of November during each odd numbered year in town. The festival includes music, food, visual art, performances, and various other events.

It is a run and gun game influenced by Liero and Scorched Earth, combined with elements from Counter-Strike and Worms. Development history Soldat was initially developed by Micha≈Ç Marcinkowski (MM) beginning in November 2001. MM is CEO of the independent game development group Transhuman Design and is also known for his work on games such as Crimson Glory, R & link-dead. The game is coded in the Delphi programming language using the JEDI libraries. The first public beta (v0.9.4b) was released on 9 May 2002. As time passed, the game changed from being developed exclusively by MM, to having many different developers that contribute in different ways, with MM still making the executive decisions for Soldat. Soldat's head developer changed over time: Micha≈Ç \\"MM\\" Marcinkowski led the project until 2008, followed until 2010 by Nick \\"EnEsCe\\" Cooper. Gregor \\"Shoozza\\" A. Cieslak lead the project from 2010 to 2016. Between 2016 and 2017 Tomasz \\"Falcon\\" Ko≈Çosowski was project lead, followed again by Gregor \\"Shoooza\\" A. Cieslak. Released in August 23, 2002 version 1.0.5b is considered the first major release of the game,Soldat version history. 1.0.5b was the last beta release. though several betas and minor versions were available in the months preceding its release. Since then, the game has gone through many changes and additions. Weapon balance is often a main focus of new releases. The significant release changes were \\"startup\\" modifications in the M82A1 Barrett, M72 LAW, and Combat Knife, as well as minor bugs with flags and maps. 1.4.2 added many major features. These included a completely new lobby system to replace the aged and unreliable original system (see the forums for problems), an option (registered only) to scale the resolution interface for a cleaner view, a minimap (registered only), BattlEye - an anti-cheat system, and many bugfixes. 1.4.0 was originally intended only as a bugfix version 1.3.2, but was bumped-up to 1.4.0 due to the addition of the many new features. 1.5.0 is the first release to be handled using public beta testing. In addition to a long list of bug fixes, major new features in this version include in game radio commands, TeamSpeak2 integration and animated GIF scenery. The version 1.6.0 - released more than two years after 1.5.0 - focuses primarily on bug fixes. It also adds a new anti-cheat solution, new maps, support for widescreen resolutions, the ability to ban by hardwareID and many in-game improvements. 1.7.0 introduced some bigger changes: It included a new OpenGL-based renderer with improved performance and major graphical updates. Released in January 2016, 1.7.1 is the latest version of the game. It brought 4K HD quality to the player models and to more scenery. As well as weapon mod changes and addition of Hitbox Modifiers for the head, chest & legs. As of April 2018, the current goal being to release the next version on Steam. An open sourcing of the game was announced for 2018 after the Steam release, following a successful change.org petition.Victory! on change.org ‚Äî Message from Micha≈Ç Marcinkowski: \\"Hey everyone here's my decision.

On May 26, 2020 the source code of Soldat was released under MIT license on GitHub.soldat on github.com The assets followed shortly after under a Creative Commons license, the CC-BY 4.0.Soldat asset license on github.com Gameplay In Soldat, the player controls a small customizable soldier who possesses jet boots. These boots allow the soldier to fly for a relatively short time, before needing to automatically regenerate their fuel. The amount of flying possible at a time, and fuel regeneration rate, both depend on individual maps. The game is normally played over the Internet or a LAN, but it is possible to play offline against bots. There are a variety of game modes to choose from, ranging from the popular free-for-all (Deathmatch, Rambomatch, and Pointmatch) to the team-based (Capture the Flag; Infiltration, Teammatch, and Hold the Flag). In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags, with minor objectives (for example, Pointmatch sports a yellow flag which doubles its bearer's points). The most popular game modes are Capture the Flag and Deathmatch. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Upon spawning, the weapons menu is displayed and the player may pick from an arsenal of weapons. Frag grenades are also supplied by default and more can picked up from boxes laying around the maps (\\"Grenade Kit\\" or \\"Nade Kit\\" respectively). Jet boots are used to move around the maps, which typically consists of 2-3 levels/floors, or disorganized, floating boulders. Some servers enable temporary-lasting power-ups that grant multiplied damage (Berserker), invisibility (Predator mode), a flamethrower along with temporary invincibility (FlameGod), or Cluster Grenades (which temporarily replace regular grenades with three of more powerful, modified versions) or even a Bulletproof Vest (effectiveness of the vest depends on the distance from the firer of the bullet, and the vest slowly decreases as it soaks up damage, disappearing after absorbing a certain amount of damage, though there is no time limit). Health crates (known in the game as \\"Medikits\\") are available in many locations for healing injury back to 100% no matter how much a player is injured. Upon death and after waiting for a server-specified amount of time (on average 5 seconds), players re-spawn and may choose another weapon‚Äîthis cycle repeats for the duration of the map, unless Survival Mode is enabled (in which case a spawning system similar to Counter-Strike is used). After a certain allotted time (on average 15 or 20 minutes), the map changes and scores are reset as players continue in another round. Players can chat with each other throughout matches (and to their own teams, for cooperative team- based game modes). Most games are fast-paced and chaotic. Bodies often explode in a spectacle of blood and body parts, sometimes being hurled clear across the map. Besides its ragdoll physics, the game's engine, written in the Borland Delphi programming language, employs realistic concepts such as momentum and gravity. Fall damage and recoil are also taken into account when Realistic Mode is enabled, and supply crates, dropped weapons, and grenades realistically tumble down steep hills; another effect is the flag's realistic waving as a player runs with it. Weapons There are ten primary weapons and four secondary weapons to choose from. A total of any two weapons may be held at any given time. Players can drop their current weapon and pick up others from defeated enemies. It is also possible to create server-specific weapon mods. The choice of weapon is largely dependent on the type of map, preferred tactics and weapons choice of the players' enemies. Soldat aims to create balance between all of the weapons (also known as Weapon Mod), in order to make all weapons viable. A lot of tweaking was done (and is done until today) in order to achieve this goal. The matter of the weapon mod is quite controversial. This has led to the existence of an entire section of the official community message board devoted to discussion about the weapons' game balance. Bunny hopping Soldat is one of many games in which bunny hopping is possible. A player can travel much faster if he or she skips along the ground via frequent leaping, and often players who do not bunny hop are left behind. However, even when bunny hopping, a basic maximum speed limits horizontal movement. In addition, leaping before thrusting substantially boosts horizontal movement, as the leap gives horizontal push while the jet boots must only manage the player's vertical ascent. Maps Screenshot of the map editor Soldat PolyWorks (version 1.4.0.4) using to create map for Soldat. We can see a crop of the edition of the map htf emblem Maps in Soldat are 2D arenas, most being tailored to fast-paced game-play. Deathmatch maps are shared with Pointmatch (PM), Rambomatch (RM), and Teammatch (TM or TDM, for Team Deathmatch) gamemodes, whereas Capture-the-Flag (CTF), Infiltration (INF) and Hold-the-Flag (HTF) have their own sets of specialized maps. There are currently 97 default maps in the game for the different game modes. Every map consists of numerous textured polygons carefully positioned in relation to one another. Unlike Liero, a major inspiration of Soldat, landscape is non- deformable, though it can be interacted with in other ways. Scenery, such as bushes and sandbags, may conceal players and aid in camping and sniping. Polygons can be given special attributes to simulate lethal death pits, icy terrain, health-regenerative platforms, and more. Weather effects (snow, rain, and sandstorm) are used on some maps. Some servers enable the powerful stationary M2 turret specified by particular maps (usually CTF and INF) which players can man. There are several known programs for mapping. The original map editor program is MapMaker 1.2, by Micha≈Ç Marcinkowski himself. It has a unique control scheme that includes using the right mouse button to navigate the map and the control, shift, and alt keys combined with the left or right mouse button to perform functions. Another popular Soldat mapping program is PolyWorks, which has a different control scheme and a much more complex interface. Community The new lobby server indicates it holds a record number of lobby requests at 71459 per day. The whole number of players has not been counted but the official Soldat Forums have over 12000 registered members.Data from http://www.soldatforums.com/ accessed at 20-01-2008 Map editors are also available. Many Soldat players have developed and distributed their own programs for use with the game. These include, but are not limited to, map editors, weapon editors, statistics programs, mods, server-side statistical webpage-plugins (such as U13SSS and Zitro-stats), and auto-join applications. There are many fan web-pages serving a multitude of purposes and tastes, mainly different clans for the official tournaments the game's community sponsors. Sub game-modes Realistic Mode As the Soldat community has grown, so has the popularity of the sub-gamemode Realistic (often abbreviated \\"R\\" or \\"R-mode\\"). Realistic makes the game have more realistic characteristics to it; the weapons are more powerful and they have recoil (the cross-hair moves upwards with each successive shot), there's a realistic field of view and players sustain greater damage when they hit the ground at high speeds. This mode emphasizes the need for proper tactics more strongly than the standard game mode, sometimes regarded as requiring more skill. Survival Mode All players spawn together at the beginning. Once players die, they must wait until the round is decided, then every player spawns again to start the next round. This game mode also provides a break from the normal non-stop action and more intensive battles. In most realistic servers, survival mode is also activated. These servers are referred to as Realistic-Survival (R/S) servers. R/S mode games usually consist of short length battles between two sides in Capture the Flag mode. Around the time of Soldat v1.3.1, most R/S matches developed a certain \\"gentlemen's rule\\" that a player should not capture the flag unless the opposing team is defeated. Because this is an unwritten rule, it is confusing to most people new to R/S servers. \\"Capping\\" or \\"Running\\" in an R/S server is usually considered bad etiquette, because it effectively defeats the other team without having to kill them. In more popular servers ran by R/S clans, capturing the flag is a legitimate tactic, as the game mode is still \\"Capture the Flag\\", not \\"Team Deathmatch\\", which only involves eradicating the enemy team. On the other hand, killing the other team and capping the flag in the few seconds remaining before the round ends, is called a doublecap, earns the team 2 points instead of the normal single point and is accepted in most servers, although many have implemented anti-doublecap scripts to prevent it. Advance Mode In Advance mode players start the match armed only with secondary weapons. Primary guns are progressively unlocked as a reward for frags. With its forced low-tech phase and limited weapon choices, advance mode is the often considered the most tactical Soldat mode. Any of these sub-game modes may be combined with the other game modes, or it can be active by itself.

It has been published by Waitrose since August 2013. It was previously published by Which?books. The Good Food Guide was first published in 1951 by Raymond Postgate, an enthusiastic gourmand, who was appalled by the standard of contemporary catering. He recruited an army of volunteers to clandestinely visit and assess restaurants on the basis that, \\"You can corrupt one man. You can't bribe an army.\\" Postgate had previously founded the Good Food Club in 1949. The Good Food Guide currently reports on over 1,200 top establishments and is unique as it is completely rewritten every year and is entirely independent ‚Äî there is no advertising or sponsorship, no fees are accepted for inclusion, and all of the inspections are anonymous. Readers are actively encouraged to submit their reviews, via the Good Food Guide website, which are then considered for prospective inclusion in next year's guide. Restaurants are scored out of ten. History An early contributor to the Guide, Margaret Costa later opened her own restaurant, Lacy's, in Mayfair. The Guide received so many reviews for Lacy's that the entry for the restaurant was divided into \\"Love Lacy's\\" and \\"Loathe Lacy's\\" columns. In 2007 former Good Food Guide inspectors and editors criticised the Guide after a series of high-profile restaurant omissions, claiming that a new inspection and editorial regime had led to corners being cut after incorporating three hundred reader-recommended restaurants within its twelve hundred full entries. Former inspector and editor, Jim Ainsworth, described the new regime as \\"penny-pinching\\" and said of the 2008 guide: \\"The word that occurs to me is careless. A lot of things simply appear to have been done in a rush.\\" Among the omissions, a restaurant was omitted in the Scilly Isles despite being listed as a main entry on the guide's map of the island. Some restaurants were omitted after a lack of reader reviews. The publishers of the Guide, Which?, strongly denied the allegations, conceding that some former inspectors had been \\"disgruntled\\" at the changes, but stressed that most of the inspection team was unchanged and there had been no reduction in standards. 2008 saw the publication of special London edition of the Guide. This followed Michelin who had published a dedicated London guide the previous year. In the 2013 edition of the Guide, Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck and Simon Rogan's L'Enclume shared a perfect score of ten. A branch of Little Chef near Popham was included in the 2010 guide after a makeover by Heston Blumenthal as part of a Channel 4 programme. In August 2013, the guide was purchased and is now published by Waitrose & Partners., The guide continues to be published annually.

History Originally formed as the beginning of Germany's first wave of rearmament, the division was first given the title of Artillerief√ºhrer I and only later called Wehrgauleitung K√∂nigsberg. These names were an effort to cover Germany's expansion of infantry divisions from seven to twenty-one. The division's infantry regiments were built up from the 1.(Preussisches) Infanterie-Regiment of the 1.Division of the Reichswehr and originally consisted of recruits from East Prussia. Samuel W. Mitcham, Jr, Hitler's Legions, The German Army Order of Battle, World War IIItalic textDorset Press, New York, 1985 The unit's Prussian heritage is represented by the Hohenzollern coat of arms that served as the divisional insignia. Upon the official revelation of the Wehrmacht in October 1935, the unit received its title of 1.Infanterie-Division. In February 1936, the headquarters of the division was moved from Insterburg to K√∂nigsberg. With the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the 1st Infantry Division advanced toward Warsaw as a component of the XXVI Army Corps in von K√ºchler's 3rd Army. It engaged Polish forces near the heavily defended town of M≈Çawa (see Battle of M≈Çawa) for several days, then crossed over the Bug and Narew Rivers. It fought again near Wƒôgr√≥w and Garwolin and ended the campaign east of Warsaw. Playing a minor role in the invasion of France, the division returned to East Prussia in the autumn of 1940. With the launch of Operation Barbarossa, the 1st Infantry Division participated in the Baltic Operation as part of the 18th Army with Army Group North, advancing on Leningrad. It remained and fought in the area of Leningrad and Lake Ladoga through December 1943. (See Siege of Leningrad.) Transferred to the 1st Panzer Army, the division fought at Krivoy Rog and broke out of an encirclement in March 1944. The 1st Infantry Division returned to its native East Prussia in the summer 1944. Except for participating in the urgent and temporary link-up with the now-isolated Army Group North in Lithuania (Operation Doppelkopf), the unit remained to defend the easternmost German province from the advancing Red Army. Alternating between 3rd Panzer and 4th Armies, the division was trapped in the K√∂nigsberg/Samland area after it was cut off from the rest of Germany by end January 1945. At 0400 hours on 19 February 1945, elements of the 1st Infantry, led by a captured Soviet T-34 tank, spearheaded a westward offensive from K√∂nigsberg intended to link with General Hans Gollnick's XXVIII Corps, which held parts of the Samland peninsula, including the vital port of Pillau. Capturing the town of Metgethen, the unit opened the way for the 5th Panzer Division to join with Gollnick's forces near the town of Gross Heydekrug the next day. This action re-opened the land route from K√∂nigsberg to Pillau, allowing for the evacuation of civilian refugees via the port and solidifying the German defense of the area until April. With the capitulation of K√∂nigsberg on 9 April 1945, the surviving elements of the division retreated to Pillau where it later surrendered to the Soviets. Organization The 1st Infantry Division was a \\"Wave 1\\" division, meaning it existed prior to the outbreak of the war. It was equipped and organized along standard lines for a German infantry division. Its original form in 1934 consisted of two infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, a pioneer battalion, and a signals unit. The division invaded Poland with the following units under command: *1st Infantry Regiment *22nd Infantry Regiment *43rd Infantry Regiment *1st Artillery Regiment *37th Artillery Regiment *31st Machine-gun Battalion *1st Anti-tank Battalion *1st Reconnaissance Battalion *1st Engineer Battalion *1st Signals Battalion *1st Medical Battalion Commanders The following officers commanded the 1st Infantry Division: * Oct 1, 1934, to Apr 1, 1935: Generalmajor Georg von K√ºchler * Apr 1, 1935, to Jan 1, 1938: Generalleutnant Walther Schroth * Jan 1, 1938 to Apr 14, 1940: Generalleutnant Joachim von Kortzfleisch * Apr 14, 1940, to Jul 12, 1941: Generalleutnant Philipp Kleffel * Jul 12, 1941, to Sept 4, 1941: Generalmajor Dr. Friedrich Altrichter * Sept 4, 1941, to Jan 16, 1942: Generalleutnant Philipp Kleffel * Jan 16, 1942 to Jun 30, 1943: Generalleutnant Martin Grase * Jul 1, 1943, to May 10, 1944: Generalleutnant Ernst-Anton von Krosigk * May 10, 1944, to Jun 8, 1944: Oberst Hans-Joachim Baurmeister * Jun 8, 1944 to Sept 30, 1944: Generalleutnant Ernst-Anton von Krosigk * Oct 1, 1944, to Feb 28, 1945: Generalleutnant Hans Schittnig * Feb 28, 1945 to Apr 26, 1945: Generalleutnant Henning von Thadden Operational history * Invasion of Poland, as part of Army Group North: ** Sept. 1939: Fought in Poland under 3.Armee of German Army Group North * Invasion of France as part of Army Group B: ** May 1940: Reserve division of 6.Armee of German Army Group B in Belgium ** June 1940: Fought in France under I.Armeekorps of 4.Armee ** Jul‚ÄìAug. 1940: Part of I.Armeekorps of 7.Armee along the Atlantic coast ** Sept 1940: Transferred to East Prussia under 18.Armee with Army Group B * Invasion of the Soviet Union as part of Army Group North: ** June 1941: Attached to 18.Armee under Army Group North ** July 1941: Transferred to XXVI.Armeekorps under 18.Armee ** Aug. 1941: Transferred to XXXXI.Armeekorps of 4.Panzergruppe ** Sept 1941: Transferred to XXXVIII.Armeekorps of 18.Armee near Peterhof ** Nov 1941: Reserve division of 18.Armee near Leningrad ** Dec 1941: Joined XXVIII.Armeekorps near Leningrad ** May 1942: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps near Volkhov ** June 1942: Rejoined I.Armeekorps near Volkhov ** Jan 1943: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps near Ladoga ** Feb 1943: Joined LIV.Armeekorps near Ladoga ** Apr 1943: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps near Ladoga ** Sept 1943: Rejoined XXVIII.Armeekorps near Tigoda * Summer 1942 campaign as part of Army Group South: ** Jan 1944: Transferred to reserves of 1.Panzer-Armee under Army Group South at Winnizia ** Feb 1944: Joined XXXXVI.Armeekorps in the Hube pocket * Retreat through Ukraine as part of Army Group North Ukraine: ** Apr 1944: Joined III.Armeekorps under Army Group North Ukraine ** May 1944: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps under 1.Panzer-Armee at Stanislau ** Jul 1944: Joined LIX.Armeekorps at Brody * Retreat into Germany: ** Aug 1944: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps under 3.Panzer-Armee of Army Group Centre at Schlossberg ** Feb 1945: Rejoined XXXXI.Armeekorps under 4.Armee at K√∂nigsberg ** Mar 1945: Reserve division of Armee-Abteilung Samland at Samland ** Apr 1945: Rejoined XXVI.Armeekorps under Armee Ostpreussen at Pillau References Citations Bibliography * Christopher Duffy.

Early life De Haan was born in Smilde, a village in the northern province of Drenthe, and grew up in Zaandam. He was said to be one of eighteen children and received a traditional Jewish education. His father, Yitzchak HaLevi de Haan, was poor and worked as a hazzan (cantor) and shochet (slaughterer). His sister, Caroline Lea de Haan, best known under her married name of Carry van Bruggen, became an important Dutch author. De Haan worked as a teacher and studied law between 1903 and 1909. He wrote in socialist publications and various other magazines during these years. He was a friend of Frederik van Eeden and Arnold Aletrino, Dutch authors of the Tachtiger school. In 1904, while living in Amsterdam, he wrote the novel Pijpelijntjes (\\"Lines from De Pijp\\"), which pretends to be a thinly veiled version of his own gay life with Aletrino in Amsterdam's \\"Pijp\\" working-class district. The homo-eroticism of the book, shocking to readers in the early 20th century, led to his dismissal from his teaching job and social-democratic political circles. Aletrino and Johanna van Maarseveen, de Haan's fianc√©e, bought almost the entire print run of the book, to keep a lid on the scandal. In 1907 he married van Maarseveen, a non-Jewish doctor, but this marriage is likely to have been platonic; they separated in 1919 but never officially divorced. A second novel, Pathologie√´n (1908, \\"Pathologies\\"), again contrary to the mores of its day, described the sorrows and joys of a sadomasochist relationship. However, this book went largely unnoticed, as did De Haan's prose sketches. He published five volumes of poems between 1914 and 1921 that brought him some acclaim. Work on behalf of Russian Jewish prisoners De Haan worked against the mass imprisonment of Jews in Czarist Russia, who were suspected of Bolshevism. His work for Russian Jews lasted two years and made him keenly aware of the evils of anti-Semitism. In 1912 de Haan made some trips to Russia, and he visited a number of prisons there, in order to study the situation of political prisoners in Russia. According to historical records, de Haan went to Russia armed with a letter of recommendation from the Queen of the Netherlands and was able to negotiate leniency for his Jewish clients. He published his shocking findings in his book \\"In Russian prisons\\" (1913). He also founded a committee, together with Dutch writer Frederik van Eeden and Dutch poet Henriette Roland Holst, which aimed at collecting signatures for the sake of inducing especially Russia's then allies France and Great Britain to exert pressure on Russia for alleviating the fate of the prisoners. \\"Precursor of Amnesty International\\" In a publication of Amnesty International he was, because of these activities, described as \\"a precursor of Amnesty International\\".\\"Wordt Vervolgd\\" (Amnesty International, Section Netherlands), March 1987 Move to Palestine Zionist beginnings Around 1910, De Haan developed an interest in Judaism, the Land of Israel and Zionism. This seems to have begun as a result of his two-year activity on behalf of imprisoned Jews from Tsarist Russia, which lasted for two years and made him deeply aware of the threats of anti-Semitism. This is a description of de Haan prior to his departure for Palestine: Religious and anti-Zionist phase De Haan wrote extensively on the subject of Eretz Israel and Zionism even before he moved there in 1919, when he settled in Jerusalem, teaching at a new law school and sending articles to the Algemeen Handelsblad (\\"General Trade Journal\\"), one of the most important Dutch daily newspapers, and the De Groene Amsterdammer (\\"The Green Amsterdam Weekly\\"), a liberal weekly. De Haan rapidly became more religiously committed. He was angered by Zionist refusals to cooperate with Arabs.Gert Hekma, Harry Oosterhuis, James D. Steakley (eds.)Gay men and the sexual history of the political left, Part 1, Routledge, 1995 p.106. At first he aligned himself with religious Zionism and the Mizrachi movement, but after meeting Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, leader of the ultra-conservative Haredi Jewish community, he became the political spokesman of the Haredim in Jerusalem and was elected political secretary of the Orthodox community council, Vaad Ha'ir. De Haan endeavoured to get an agreement with Arab nationalist leaders to allow unrestricted Jewish immigration into Palestine in exchange for a Jewish declaration forgoing the Balfour Declaration.Menachem Friedman, 'Haredim and Palestinians in Jerusalem', in Marshall J. Berger, Ora Ahimeir, Jerusalem: a city and its future, Syracuse University Press, 2002, pp.235-255, p.238. During this time it is alleged that he continued to have relationships with men, including Arabs from east Jerusalem. In one of his poems he asks himself whether his visits to the Wailing Wall were motivated by a desire for God or for the Arab boys there.Robert F. Aldrich, Colonialism and homosexuality,Psychology Press, 2003 p.84. The secular Zionist establishment would not allow the established Haredi community in Palestine to be represented in the Jewish Agency in the 1920s . In response, the Haredim founded an Agudath Israel branch in Jerusalem to represent their interests in Mandate Palestine. The leader of the Haredi Jews in Palestine at the time, Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, chose de Haan to organise and represent the Haredi position as their foreign minister,Anita Shapira, Berl: the biography of a socialist Zionist, Berl Katznelson, 1887-1944,CUP Archive, 1984, p.146. on a diplomatic level equal to that of the secular Zionists. When Lord Northcliffe, a British publisher, was about to visit the Middle East, de Haan went to Alexandria, Egypt to present the case of Palestine's Haredim before he reached Palestine: De Haan, speaking on behalf of Agudath Israel, even opposed the British authorities allocating separate benefits to the Zionist-led Yishuv. In August 1923 De Haan also met in Amman with the Hashemite leader Emir Hussein bin Ali, and his son, Emir Abdullah, the future king of independent Transjordan, seeking their support for the Old Yishuv (the pre- Zionist Jewish community in the Holy Land), explaining the Haredi Jewish opposition to the Zionist plans of founding a state, and supporting the establishment of an official Palestinian state within the Emirate of Transjordan as part of a federation. De Haan made plans to travel to London in July 1924 with an anti-Zionist Haredi delegation to argue against Zionism. Assassination As part of his anti-Zionist activity, de Haan was just about to leave for London when he was assassinated in Jerusalem by the Haganah on the early morning of 30 June 1924.Menachem Friedman, ibid. p.238. As he exited the synagogue at the Shaare Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road, the Haganah member Avraham Tehomi, who was dressed in white, approached him and asked him for the time, then shot him three times and ran away from the scene. De Haan died minutes later. Avraham Tehomi, assassin of Jacob Isra√´l de Haan At first, the Palestinian Jewish society, the Yishuv, readily accepted the theory that the assassination had to be blamed on Arabs, and didn't doubt the Zionist leadership's reassurances that it had played no part in it. With time doubts started rising, until finally, in 1952, Yosef Hecht, the first commander of the main Jewish pre-state self-defense organisation, the Haganah, told the official Haganah historian in a testimony what had actually occurred. Hecht, in order to stop de Haan's activity in London, discussed the issue with Zechariah Urieli, the Haganah commander in Jerusalem, and the resulting decision was to assassinate him. Two Haganah members, Avraham Tehomi and Avraham Krichevsky, were selected for the task. Hecht only informed the Yishuv's civilian leadership after the assassination, by contacting Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, a senior member of the National Council. Hecht stated that \\"he did not regret it and would do it again.\\" Previously to the facts being published, journalist Liel Leibovitz wrote that, while the identity of exactly who ordered the assassination was unknown, \\"there's little doubt that many in the senior Zionist leadership in Jerusalem knew about the proposal to kill de Haan‚Äîand that none objected.\\" The 1985 publication of De Haan: The first political assassination in Palestine, by Shlomo Nakdimon and Shaul Mayzlish, revived wider interest in his assassination. Nakdimon and Mayzlish were able to trace Tehomi, then a businessman living in Hong Kong. Tehomi was interviewed for Israeli TV by Nakdimon and stated that Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who later became the second President of Israel (1952-1963), must have ordered the assassination: \\"I have done what the Haganah decided had to be done. And nothing was done without the order of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi... I have no regrets because he (de Haan) wanted to destroy our whole idea of Zionism.\\" Tehomi denied allegations that De Haan's assassination was related to his homosexuality: \\"I neither heard nor knew about this\\", adding \\"why is it someone's business what he does at his home?\\" According to Gert Hekma, Zionists spread a rumour he had been killed by Arabs because of his sexual relations with Arab boys.Gert Hekma, 'De Haan, Jacob Israel' in Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon (eds.) Who's who in gay and lesbian history: from antiquity to World War II, Routledge, 2003 p.143 Aftermath and commemoration De Haan was buried on the Mount of Olives. His funeral was attended by hundreds of Haredim, along with Zionist and British representatives. Following the funeral, many Haredim ventured into the city center to confront Zionists, and were barely restrained by the police. The headquarters of Agudath Israel received condolences from the Palestine government, the French and Spanish consuls in Jerusalem, and various cables from around the world. In New York, Ultra-Orthodox Jews circulated Yiddish leaflets praising De Haan and condemning \\"Torahless Zionists, who use violence to enslave the pious.‚Äù The British authorities offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer, but Tehomi was never caught. A young pioneer named Yaakov Gussman was briefly detained by the British police on suspicion of carrying out the assassination, but released for lack of evidence. The assassination caused shock in Palestine and Europe. Senior Zionist leaders, among them David Ben-Gurion, blamed each other. There was widespread speculation as to the identity of the assassin, with the theories postulated including him being a Zionist, a Haredi enraged over the revelations of De Haan's homosexuality, or an Arab lover. De Haan's murder is considered the first political murder in the Jewish community in Palestine. His activities were perceived as undermining the struggle for the establishment of a Jewish state, but the assassination sparked a controversy and was harshly condemned by some. Labor movement publicist Moshe Beilinson wrote: German author Arnold Zweig published a book in 1932 based on De Haan's life called \\"De Vriendt kehrt heim\\" (English title \\"De Vriendt Goes Home\\"). The Israeli writer Haim Beer's book \\"Notzot\\" (1979, translated into English as Feathers) also has a character based on De Haan. In Neturei Karta circles De Haan is considered a martyr, killed by secular Jews while protecting the Jewish religion; nevertheless, most Haredim recoil from his homosexuality, his religious questioning and his attempted coalition with the Arab nationalists against his fellow Jews.Prof. M. Friedman, Society and Religion, pp. 230-247 During the 1980s, the Neturei Karta community in Jerusalem tried to change the name of the Zupnik Garden to commemorate De Haan.  Netherlands  Poem by De Haan on a sculpture in Amsterdam Although De Haan's fame waned after his death, his works have been published and reprinted in a fairly constant stream. Even under the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, David Koker managed to publish his Brieven uit Jeruzalem ('Letters from Jerusalem') in a little book. In 1949, a committee was founded with the object to publish a collected edition of the poems, which duly followed in 1952. A 'Society Jacob Isra√´l de Haan' furthered other publications: philosophical aphorisms and letters, and a memoir by his sister Mies de Haan. In the 1960s two attempts at a biography were published, and after 1970 an actual De Haan-revival brought with it a flood of publicity. Many of his publications about law and significs have been reprinted, as were his novels, and his earlier prose has been rescued from obscure magazines. Dozens of bibliophile editions honoured his poems and prose sketches. Many magazine articles and other publications about his life were published, and generated heated debates. A large volume of his correspondence (only of the period 1902-1908), published in 1994, shed a bright light on his life, but a full-scale biography has yet to be written. Through the years, in the Netherlands there have been projects, festivals and theatre productions commemorating Jacob Isra√´l de Haan's work and life. A line from De Haan's poem \\"To a Young Fisherman\\": \\"For friendship such a limitless longing...\\", is inscribed on one of the three sides of the Homomonument in Amsterdam.

His paternal grandfather was the second son of Sir John Scott, 1st Baronet of Ancrum, Roxburghshire in Scotland. His maternal grandfather was Huguenot settler Pierre Morin. He attended public school in New York before attending Yale College in New Haven, graduating in 1746 at the age of 16. Career After graduation from Yale and further study, he was admitted to the New York bar association in 1752, and practiced law in Manhattan, where he also served as an alderman from 1756 to 1761. In 1752, along with William Livingston and William Smith, he founded a weekly journal, the Independent Reflector.Dillon, Dorothy R.

From 1756 to 1761, he served as a New York alderman. In 1768, he was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 3:481‚Äì487. American Revolution Scott was a founding member of the Sons of Liberty and in 1775, he was a member of the New York General Committee. During the Revolutionary War, John Scott was a member of the New York Provincial Congress (from 1775 to 1777), while also serving as a brigadier general under George Washington in the New York and New Jersey campaign. He commanded the 1st New York (Independent) Battalion, the 2nd New York (County) Battalion, and several New York Militia Regiments. He fought with Putnam's division at the Battle of Brooklyn on August 27, 1776, and was the last of Washington's generals to argue against surrendering Manhattan to the British‚Äîpossibly due to his large landholdings there, including what is now Times Square and New York City's Theater District. Twenty days later, on September 16, 1776, Scott led the same battalions and regiments at the Battle of Harlem Heights, an American victory. On October 28, 1776, his forces participated in the Battle of White Plains. Post War life In 1776, Scott was a member of the State of New York committee to author a state constitution. After the war, Scott regained his Manhattan estate and, in 1777, was a candidate for the first governorship of New York State, losing to George Clinton. Scott was elected Associate Justice of the State Supreme Court of New York in 1777, but declined. Instead, he became New York's first Secretary of State, a State Senator (representing the Southern District from 1777 to 1782), and served as an active delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1782. Personal life Scott's headstone Scott was married to Helena Rutgers (1730‚Äì1798), a daughter of Petrus Rutgers and Helena (n√©e Hooglant) Rutgers. Together, they were the parents of: * Mary Morin Scott (1753‚Äì1796), who married John Litchfield in 1770. After his death in 1775, she married Charles McKnight (1750‚Äì1791) in 1778. * Lewis Allaire Scott (1759‚Äì1798), who married Juliana Sitgreaves (1765‚Äì1842). Lewis was one of the two Deputy Secretaries of State during his father's tenure, and in 1784 was appointed to succeed him, dying in office in 1798. Scott died in New York City on September 14, 1784 and his body was interred at the north entrance of Trinity Church, New York. His inscribed slab is visible from the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. An equestrian statue is erected in his honor in Upper Manhattan.

Aspergillus fumigatus, a saprotroph widespread in nature, is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter, such as compost heaps, where it plays an essential role in carbon and nitrogen recycling. Colonies of the fungus produce from conidiophores; thousands of minute grey-green conidia (2‚Äì3 Œºm) which readily become airborne. For many years, A. fumigatus was thought to only reproduce asexually, as neither mating nor meiosis had ever been observed. In 2008, A. fumigatus was shown to possess a fully functional sexual reproductive cycle, 145 years after its original description by Fresenius. Although A. fumigatus occurs in areas with widely different climates and environments, it displays low genetic variation and a lack of population genetic differentiation on a global scale. Thus, the capability for sex is maintained, though little genetic variation is produced. The fungus is capable of growth at (normal human body temperature), and can grow at temperatures up to , with conidia surviving at ‚Äîconditions it regularly encounters in self-heating compost heaps. Its spores are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and everybody inhales an estimated several hundred spores each day; typically, these are quickly eliminated by the immune system in healthy individuals. In immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and people with AIDS or leukemia, the fungus is more likely to become pathogenic, over-running the host's weakened defenses and causing a range of diseases generally termed aspergillosis. Due to the recent increase in the use of immunosuppressants to treat human illnesses, it is estimated that A. fumigatus may be responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually with a mortality rate between 25-90%. Several virulence factors have been postulated to explain this opportunistic behaviour. When the fermentation broth of A. fumigatus was screened, a number of indolic alkaloids with antimitotic properties were discovered. The compounds of interest have been of a class known as tryprostatins, with spirotryprostatin B being of special interest as an anticancer drug. Aspergillus fumigatus grown on certain building materials can produce genotoxic and cytotoxic mycotoxins, such as gliotoxin. Genome Aspergillus fumigatus has a stable haploid genome of 29.4 million base pairs. The genome sequences of three Aspergillus species-- Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, and Aspergillus oryzae--were published in Nature in December 2005. Pathogenesis Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent cause of invasive fungal infection in immunosuppressed individuals, which include patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune or neoplastic disease, organ transplant recipients, and AIDS patients. A. fumigatus primarily causes invasive infection in the lung and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these individuals. Additionally, A. fumigatus can cause chronic pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or allergic disease in immunocompetent hosts. Innate immune response Inhalational exposure to airborne conidia is continuous due to their ubiquitous distribution in the environment. However, in healthy individuals, the innate immune system is an efficacious barrier to A. fumigatus infection. A large portion of inhaled conidia are cleared by the mucociliary action of the respiratory epithelium. Due to the small size of conidia, many of them deposit in alveoli, where they interact with epithelial and innate effector cells. Alveolar macrophages phagocytize and destroy conidia within their phagosomes. Epithelial cells, specifically type II pneumocytes, also internalize conidia which traffic to the lysosome where ingested conidia are destroyed. First line immune cells also serve to recruit neutrophils and other inflammatory cells through release of cytokines and chemokines induced by ligation of specific fungal motifs to pathogen recognition receptors. Neutrophils are essential for aspergillosis resistance, as demonstrated in neutropenic individuals, and are capable of sequestering both conidia and hyphae through distinct, non-phagocytic mechanisms. Hyphae are too large for cell-mediated internalization, and thus neutrophil-mediated NADPH-oxidase induced damage represents the dominant host defense against hyphae. In addition to these cell-mediated mechanisms of elimination, antimicrobial peptides secreted by the airway epithelium contribute to host defense. Invasion Schematic of invasive Aspergillus infection: Hyphae germinate either within an epithelial cell or within the alveoli. Hyphae extend through the epithelial cells, eventually invading and traversing endothelial cells of the vasculature. In rare cases, hyphal fragments break off and disseminate through the blood stream. Immunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to invasive A. fumigatus infection, which most commonly manifests as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Inhaled conidia that evade host immune destruction are the progenitors of invasive disease. These conidia emerge from dormancy and make a morphological switch to hyphae by germinating in the warm, moist, nutrient-rich environment of the pulmonary alveoli. Germination occurs both extracellularly or in type II pneumocyte endosomes containing conidia. Following germination, filamentous hyphal growth results in epithelial penetration and subsequent penetration of the vascular endothelium. The process of angioinvasion causes endothelial damage and induces a proinflammatory response, tissue factor expression and activation of the coagulation cascade. This results in intravascular thrombosis and localized tissue infarction, however, dissemination of hyphal fragments is usually limited. Dissemination through the blood stream only occurs in severely immunocompromised individuals. Hypoxia Response As is common with tumor cells and other pathogens, the invasive hyphae of A. fumigatus encounters hypoxic (low oxygen levels, ‚â§ 1%) micro-environments at the site of infection in the host organism. Current research suggests that upon infection, necrosis and inflammation cause tissue damage which decreases available oxygen concentrations due to a local reduction in perfusion, the passaging of fluids to organs. In A. fumigatus specifically, secondary metabolites have been found to inhibit the development of new blood vessels leading to tissue damage, the inhibition of tissue repair, and ultimately localized hypoxic micro- environments. The exact implications of hypoxia on fungal pathogenesis is currently unknown, however these low oxygen environments have long been associated with negative clinical outcomes. Due to the significant correlations identified between hypoxia, fungal infections, and negative clinical outcomes, the mechanisms by which A. fumigatus adapts in hypoxia is a growing area of focus for novel drug targets. Two highly characterized sterol- regulatory element binding proteins, SrbA and SrbB, along with their processing pathways, have been shown to impact the fitness of A. fumigatus in hypoxic conditions. The transcription factor SrbA is the master regulator in the fungal response to hypoxia in vivo and is essential in many biological processes including iron homeostasis, antifungal azole drug resistance, and virulence. Consequently, the loss of SrbA results in an inability for A. fumigatus to grow in low iron conditions, a higher sensitivity to anti-fungal azole drugs, and a complete loss of virulence in IPA (invasive pulmonary aspergillosis) mouse models. SrbA knockout mutants do not show any signs of in vitro growth in low oxygen, which is thought to be associated with the attenuated virulence. SrbA functionality in hypoxia is dependent upon an upstream cleavage process carried out by the proteins RbdB, SppA, and Dsc A-E. SrbA is cleaved from an endoplasmic reticulum residing 1015 amino acid precursor protein to a 381 amino acid functional form. The loss of any of the above SrbA processing proteins results in a dysfunctional copy of SrbA and a subsequent loss of in vitro growth in hypoxia as well as attenuated virulence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies with the SrbA protein led to the identification of a second hypoxia regulator, SrbB. Although little is known about the processing of SrbB, this transcription factor has also shown to be a key player in virulence and the fungal hypoxia response. Similar to SrbA, a SrbB knockout mutant resulted in a loss of virulence, however, there was no heightened sensitivity towards antifungal drugs nor a complete loss of growth under hypoxic conditions (50% reduction in SrbB rather than 100% reduction in SrbA). In summary, both SrbA and SrbB have shown to be critical in the adaptation of A. fumigatus in the mammalian host. Nutrient acquisition Aspergillus fumigatus must acquire nutrients from its external environment to survive and flourish within its host. Many of the genes involved in such processes have been shown to impact virulence through experiments involving genetic mutation. Examples of nutrient uptake include that of metals, nitrogen, and macromolecules such as peptides. Proposed Siderophore Biosynthetic Pathway of Aspergillus fumigatus: sidA catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of both the extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C and intracellular ferricrocin =Iron acquisition= Iron is a necessary cofactor for many enzymes, and can act as a catalyst in the electron transport system. A. fumigatus has two mechanisms for the uptake of iron, reductive iron acquisition and siderophore-mediated. Reductive iron acquisition includes conversion of iron from the ferric (Fe+3) to the ferrous (Fe+2) state and subsequent uptake via FtrA, an iron permease. Targeted mutation of the ftrA gene did not induce a decrease in virulence in the murine model of A. fumigatus invasion. In contrast, targeted mutation of sidA, the first gene in the siderophore biosynthesis pathway, proved siderophore-mediated iron uptake to be essential for virulence. Mutation of the downstream siderophore biosynthesis genes sidC, sidD, sidF and sidG resulted in strains of A. fumigatus with similar decreases in virulence. These mechanisms of iron uptake appear to work in parallel and both are upregulated in response to iron starvation. =Nitrogen assimilation= Aspergillus fumigatus can survive on a variety of different nitrogen sources, and the assimilation of nitrogen is of clinical importance, as it has been shown to affect virulence. Proteins involved in nitrogen assimilation are transcriptionally regulated by the AfareA gene in A. fumigatus. Targeted mutation of the afareA gene showed a decrease in onset of mortality in a mouse model of invasion. The Ras regulated protein RhbA has also been implicated in nitrogen assimilation. RhbA was found to be transcriptionally upregulated following contact of A. fumigatus with human endothelial cells, and strains with targeted mutation of the rhbA gene showed decreased growth on poor nitrogen sources and reduced virulence in vivo. =Proteinases= The human lung contains large quantities of collagen and elastin, proteins that allow for tissue flexibility. Aspergillus fumigatus produces and secretes elastases, proteases that cleave elastin in order to break down these macromolecular polymers for uptake. A significant correlation between the amount of elastase production and tissue invasion was first discovered in 1984. Clinical isolates have also been found to have greater elastase activity than environmental strains of A. fumigatus. A number of elastases have been characterized, including those from the serine protease, aspartic protease, and metalloprotease families. Yet, the large redundancy of these elastases has hindered the identification of specific effects on virulence.  Unfolded protein response  A number of studies found that the unfolded protein response contributes to virulence of A. fumigatus. Secondary metabolism =Secondary metabolites in fungal development= The transcription factor LaeA regulates the expression of several genes involved in secondary metabolite production in Aspergillus spp. The lifecycle of filamentous fungi including Aspergillus spp. consists of two phases: a hyphal growth phase and a reproductive (sporulation) phase. The switch between growth and reproductive phases of these fungi is regulated in part by the level of secondary metabolite production. The secondary metabolites are believed to be produced to activate sporulation and pigments required for sporulation structures. G protein signaling regulates secondary metabolite production. Genome sequencing has revealed 40 potential genes involved in secondary metabolite production including mycotoxins, which are produced at the time of sporulation. =Gliotoxin= Gliotoxin is a mycotoxin capable of altering host defenses through immunosuppression. Neutrophils are the principal targets of gliotoxin. Gliotoxin interrupts the function of leukocytes by inhibiting migration and superoxide production and causes apoptosis in macrophages. Gliotoxin disrupts the proinflammatory response through inhibition of NF-Œ∫B. =Transcriptional regulation of gliotoxin= LaeA and GliZ are transcription factors known to regulate the production of gliotoxin. LaeA is a universal regulator of secondary metabolite production in Aspergillus spp. LaeA influences the expression of 9.5% of the A. fumigatus genome, including many secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes such as nonribosomal peptide synthetases. The production of numerous secondary metabolites, including gliotoxin, were impaired in an LaeA mutant (ŒîlaeA) strain. The ŒîlaeA mutant showed increased susceptibility to macrophage phagocytosis and decreased ability to kill neutrophils ex vivo. LaeA regulated toxins, besides gliotoxin, likely have a role in virulence since loss of gliotoxin production alone did not recapitulate the hypo-virulent ‚àÜlaeA pathotype. Current treatments to combat A. fumigatus infections Current noninvasive treatments used to combat fungal infections consist of a class of drugs known as azoles. Azole drugs such as voriconazole, itraconazole, and imidazole kill fungi by inhibiting the production of ergosterol‚Äîa critical element of fungal cell membranes. Mechanistically, these drugs act by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome p450 enzyme known as 14Œ±-demethylase. However, A. fumigatus resistance to azoles is increasing, potentially due to the use of low levels of azoles in agriculture. The main mode of resistance is through mutations in the cyp51a gene. However, other modes of resistance have been observed accounting for almost 40% of resistance in clinical isolates. Along with azoles, other anti-fungal drug classes do exist such as polyenes and echinocandins. Although these drugs, azoles in particular, have been shown to successfully combat A. fumigatus pathogenesis in immune compromised and healthy hosts, novel drug targets are essential due to a worldwide increase in drug resistant fungal strains.

To qualify for inclusion a peak must also meet the more technical criterion of topographic prominence important in the mountaineering sport of peak-bagging. The White Mountains Four Thousand Footers List is established (and revised from time to time) by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The AMC calls it the White Mountains List, but others call it the New Hampshire List because it does not include Old Speck Mountain (4,170 ft) in Maine, which is outside the White Mountain National Forest but within the White Mountains. The AMC also maintains a list of New England 4000 Footers, all falling within Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Other lists of 4000-footers not maintained by the AMC include the original set of 4,000-foot mountains for peak-bagging: the 46 High Peaks in the Adirondacks. The AMC has revised its 4000-footer lists as surveying became more accurate or the selection criteria were adjusted, with the White Mountains list growing from 46 peaks in the 1950s to 48 in 1982. The proper inclusion or exclusion of several peaks is still a matter of some dispute. The 48 lie in the White Mountain National Forest, within two northern counties of New Hampshire: Coos and Grafton. All peaks except those of Mount Washington, Mount Moosilauke and Cannon Mountain are on land owned by the Forest Service, and these three are almost completely surrounded by it. Prominence A topographic prominence criterion is applied to exclude high points which are considered subsidiary peaks of a larger mountain. The definition of topographic prominence is the vertical separation between a peak and the low point of the highest ridge connecting it to a higher one. In practical terms, prominence is the minimum distance a hiker must descend before ascending a higher peak. The AMC's 4000-Footer lists require that a mountain rise beyond a ridge connecting it to its neighbor. Earlier versions required either of prominence or of separation. Four Thousand Footer club A committee of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) sets the criteria and collects information verifying that peaks meet them. It also maintains a list of the Four Thousand Footer Club's self-declared members, who request recognition for having ascended on foot all of the 48. The first of these was compiled in 1958. There are numerous variations in completing the Four Thousand Footer list. For example, the AMC maintains a roster of those making ascents between the winter solstice and spring equinox. Another not officially recorded is reaching each summit twelve times, once in each of the twelve months, in any calendar order.

Static Previews was met with mixed reviews from music critics, with comments on the vocals and guitarwork. It has since been viewed a benchmark for the second wave of emo. Background Jimmy Eat World released their self-titled debut album in 1994 through local label Wooden Blue records. As the members left high school, frontman Jim Adkins was part of a production company with Joel Leibow, co- founder of Wooden Blue. The production company listed itself in Maximumrocknroll guide Book Your Own Fuckin' Life, which aided bands, promoters and venues in booking shows across the country. After being contacted by Christie Front Drive for a show, Leibow asked the band to do a split single with Jimmy Eat World. The band was contacted by various major labels, who asked them for a tape of their music. A talent scout from major label Capitol Records went to a show to seek out Sense Field, however, they were enticed by the opening act Christie Front Drive. The scout proceeded to ask that band if they had new material he could hear. The band mentioned they had released a split with Jimmy Eat World. Sometime afterwards, Jimmy Eat World played a benefit show; a staff member at Capitol Records was in the audience and approached the band. They signed to the label in mid-1995 for a development deal that included one album, with the possibility for six more. Around this time, bassist Mitch Porter became a Mormon missionary and left the group. He was replaced by Carrier bassist Rick Burch, who guitarist Tom Linton had knew since the seventh grade. Production When the band was searching for an engineer to record with for their forthcoming album, they came across former Drive Like Jehu member Mark Trombino. The band recorded two songs with him, \\"Opener\\" and \\"77 Satelittes\\", which were released on 7\\" vinyl through record label An Industry for Outer Space. At the label's insistence, the band went a rehearsal room in Los Angeles, California, where they were told to write some new songs and rework others under the authority of a producer the label sanctioned. The band did pre-production at Mind's Eye Digital in Mesa, Arizona with engineer Larry Elyea. Static Prevails was recorded in 1995 at Sound City in Los Angeles, and at Big Fish, in Encinitas, California. While the band wanted Trombino to produce the album, Capitol insisted on the production duo of Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf, who had previously produced the likes of Foo Fighters and Beck. The label eventually relented, with Jimmy Eat World working with Trombino and Wes Kidd of labelmates Triple Fast Action; Jimmy Eat World were also given a producer credit. Billy Bowers and Jeff Sheehan served as assistant engineers at Sound City. When the band recorded \\"Seventeen\\" it initially featured the chorus lyric \\"You're only seventeen\\", however, when they realised it sound too similar to a song by Winger, Linton changed the lyrics and re-recorded it. Trombino, who also acted as engineer, mixed almost all of the recordings, except for \\"Rockstar\\" and \\"Seventeen\\", in Studio C at Capitol Studios. Peter Doell, Billy Smith, and Steve Genewick worked as assistant engineers at Capitol. Rothrock and Schnapf mixed \\"Rockstar\\" and \\"Seventeen\\" at Sunset Sound, with assistant engineer Cappy Japngie. Rothrock and Schnapf mixed them at the insistence of Captiol, as the label was aiming to send the songs to alternative radio; subsequnetly, the vocals on both tracks ended up high in the mix. Stephen Marcussen mastered the recordings at Precision Mastering. Craig Aaronson served as the executive producer. Composition Static Prevails marked a shift from the group's previous pop punk material in the vein of NOFX and J Church, and into melodic post-hardcoreKeiper 2002, p. 83 and emo, compared to groups such as Seam, Tortoise, and Sunny Day Real Estate. Drummer Zach Lind attributed this change in style due to listening to Christie Front Drive, which they found to be \\"really melodic but still very powerful.\\" Lind played in a more aggressive and noisier style, displaying rock-orientated drumming, with elements of his punk rock roots. Unlike the previous album, which was sung mainly by Linton or all subsequent records, sung predominantly by Adkins, Static Prevails splits lead vocals almost fairly between both singers. Adkins' vocals drew comparison to the Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg. In addition to his regular role, Lind also played accordion and concertina. Eric Richter of Christie Front Drive provided additional vocals on \\"Digits\\", Kidd played acoustic guitar on \\"Claire\\", Sarah Pont performed violin, and Trombino contributed Moog synthesizer. The opening track \\"Thinking, That's All\\" and \\"Call It in the Air\\" were screamo-esque songs, the former channeling the sound of Unwound. \\"Claire\\" evoked Texas Is the Reason with its quiet and loud sections, aided by a violin. \\"Call It in the Air\\" with its punk-esque sound earned it a comparison to Sense Field. Tracks such as \\"Seventeen\\", \\"Digits\\" and \\"Robot Factory\\" were reminiscent of the releases on Homestead and Twin/Tone Records. An earlier version of \\"Digits\\" was released on their split with Christie Front Drive. The closing track \\"Anderson Mesa\\" features a string arrangement. Release After handing in the finished album, the staff at Capitol were \\"bummed ... Just guys being like, 'Uh‚Ä¶ this is a lot different than what we expected'\\", according to Linton. Jimmy Eat World toured the west coast in anitpaction of their new album, between May and July 1996. Static Prevails released on July 23, 1996 by Capitol Records; the cover artwork features a sideways photo of chimneys, taken on a rooftop in Denver, Colorado by Paul Drake. The vinyl version, which featured different artwork, included the bonus 7\\" vinyl of \\"In the Same Room\\" and \\"77 Satellites\\". A music video was made for \\"Rockstar\\", and included on some copies of the CD version of the album as enhanced content. \\"Call It in the Air\\" was released as a 7\\" vinyl single with \\"Rockstar\\" as the B-side. Static Prevails was promoted with a mini US tour along the west coast, and later embarked on a tour with Smoking Popes and the Figgs. In February 1997, the band embarked on a cross-country US tour with Sense Field.Martin 1997, p. 10 Capitol Records felt the original version of \\"Seventeen\\" would work in the movie Never Been Kissed (1999), and in return for letting the label use it in the film, the band met Drew Barrymore. Along with Clarity (1999), Static Prevails was re-released in 2007; \\"77 Satellites\\" and \\"What Would I Say to You Now\\" were included as bonus tracks. Static Prevails, alongside Clarity and Futures (2004), was re-pressed on vinyl in 2014. Reception Static Prevails was met with mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Mike DaRonco stated, \\"what Static Prevails essentially lacks is the songwriting maturity that Jimmy Eat World could have perfected; but it's almost as if the studio heads at Capitol wouldn't let them so that there would be more room for radio- friendly pop songs. In the end, nobody won.\\" Harry Guerin of RT√â found it to be \\"largely a textbook emo record\\" that \\"never really keeps your attention throughout.\\" It had \\"too many instances of familiar sounding riffs and overwrought vocals ... to be convincing.\\" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide said it was \\"very much of its time,\\" complete with \\"anxiety-ridden vocals, lyrics of suburban melodrama, and screaming punk guitars.\\"Brackett; Hoard eds. p. 432 BBC Music writer Tim Nelson opened his reviewing asking if the album title was \\"presumably meant ironically\\" as \\"staying still is one thing this propulsive pop album ... doesn‚Äôt do.\\" It \\"crosses the abyss between indie indulgence and soul-sucking corporate pap with aplomb\\". Static Prevails, along with Clarity, is seen as a landmark in the second wave of emo. In 2012, The A.V. Club noted, \\"As with so many punk bands that signed to a major during that decade, Jimmy Eat World gained precious few new fans‚Äîand lost many old ones‚Äîwith Static Prevails.\\" Track listing All songs written by Jimmy Eat World.

The Underground Press Syndicate (UPS), later known as the Alternative Press Syndicate (APS), was a network of countercultural newspapers and magazines formed in mid-1966 by the publishers of five early underground papers: the East Village Other, the Los Angeles Free Press, the Berkeley Barb, The Paper, and Fifth Estate. As it evolved, the Underground Press Syndicate created an Underground Press Service, and later its own magazine. For many years the Underground Press Syndicate was run by Tom Forcade, who later founded High Times magazine. A UPS roster published in November 1966 listed 14 underground papers,1966 Underground Press Syndicate Roster but within a few years the number had mushroomed. A 1971 roster, published in Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book, listed 271 UPS-affiliated papers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.1971 Underground Press Syndicate Roster According to historian John McMillian, writing in his 2010 book Smoking Typewriters, the underground press' combined readership eventually reached into the millions.  Overview  UPS members agreed to allow all other members to freely reprint their contents, to exchange gratis subscriptions with each other, and to occasionally print a listing of all UPS newspapers with their addresses. And anyone who agreed to those terms was allowed to join the syndicate. As a result, countercultural news stories, criticism and cartoons were widely disseminated, and a wealth of content was available to even the most modest start-up paper. First-hand coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots in Fifth Estate was one example of material that was widely copied in other papers of the syndicate. It was hoped that the syndicate would sell national advertising space that would run in all five papers, but this never happened. The early papers varied greatly in visual style, content, and even in basic concept ‚Äî and emerged from very different kinds of communities. Many were decidedly rough-hewn, learning journalistic and production skills on the run. Some were militantly political while others, like the San Francisco Oracle, featured highly spiritual content and were graphically sophisticated and adventuresome. According to historian Abe Peck, The Rag in Austin was the first to successfully merge countercultural content with radical politics, and \\"to represent the participatory democracy, community organizing and synthesis of politics and culture that the New Left of the midsixties was trying to develop.\\" Peck, Abe. Uncovering the Sixties (New York: Pantheon Books, 1985).  History  Shortly after the formation of the UPS, the number of \\"underground\\" papers throughout North America expanded dramatically. Walter Bowart and John Wilcock of the East Village Other, with Michael Kindman of The Paper, in East Lansing, Michigan, took the lead in inviting the other papers to join. The San Francisco Oracle, The Rag, and the Illustrated Paper (a psychedelic paper published in Mendocino, California) joined soon afterward, and membership grew rapidly in 1967 as new papers were founded and immediately joined. The first paper in the deep South to join was The Inquisition (Charlotte, North Carolina). \\"Fluxus West,\\" a Fluxus offshoot mostly engaged in mail art and self-publishing activities, founded by Ken Friedman, was also one of the founding publishers in 1967.Friedman, Ken \\"Fluxus: A Laboratory of Ideas\\" in Baas, Jacquelynn, editor, \\"Fluxus and the Essential Questions of Life.\\" Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, The University of Chicago Press, 2011. Friedman stated \\"Fluxus West, for example, was one of the six or seven founding publishers of the Underground Press Syndicate in 1967, but we never gained any traction on the way the papers were design ed or what they dealt with. Even though we can be found in the first lists of founding papers, along with the East Village Other, the Berkeley Barb, and the Los Angeles Free Press, we vanish from history soon after because our focus was so vastly different. Did we exert a role in developing the concept of an alternate press' Yes. Did we have any real part in the way the press developed? Perhaps we did , at least in a small way. Did we succeed in directing serious attention to cultural issues beyond the standard underground press focal points of rock music, drugs, sex, and new left politics? Not hardly.\\" The first gathering of underground papers, sponsored by UPS, was held at the home of the San Francisco Oracle's Walter Bowart in Stinson Beach, California, in March 1967, with some 30 people representing a half dozen papers in attendance.Walt Crowley, Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle The meeting was chaotic and largely symbolic, and the concept amorphous. As Thorne Dreyer and Victoria Smith wrote for Liberation News Service (LNS), the formation of UPS was designed \\"to create the illusion of a giant coordinated network of freaky papers, poised for the kill.\\" But, they added, \\"this mythical value was to be extremely important: the shoes could be grown into,\\" and the emergence of UPS helped to create a sense of national community and to make the papers feel less isolated in their efforts.Dreyer, Thorne and Victoria Smith, The Movement and the New Media, Liberation News Service, March 1, 1969. By June 1967, a UPS conference in Iowa City hosted by Middle Earth drew 80 newspaper editors from US and Canada, including representatives of Liberation News Service. LNS, founded by Marshall Bloom and Ray Mungo that summer, would play an equally important and complementary role in the growth and evolution of the underground press in the United States. An attempt that summer to coordinate and centralize the UPS at the offices of the East Village Other in New York City by Bob Rudnick failed. The explosive growth of the underground press began to subside, however, by 1970, and by 1973 the boom was clearly over. After a 1973 meeting of underground and alternative newspapers in Boulder, Colorado, the name of the syndicate was changed to the Alternative Press Syndicate (APS). APS was ultimately a failed attempt to reinvent the syndicate to compete with the growing network of alternative weeklies networked by the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. APS members sorely needed revenues and in 1973, \\"Richard Lasky, ex-Rolling Stone Magazine Advertising Director of the successful San Francisco-based weekly and Sheldon (Shelly) Schorr of Concert Magazine, published in several cities,\\" created a national advertising media selling company, APSmedia. APSmedia placed advertising from primarily record and stereo companies with success, placing more than 350 pages of advertising for many of the publications in the bigger markets in the first year. As cities were in the major markets, it mostly sold ads into publications without the advertisers knowing anything more than the names of the client papers. In 1976 APSmedia dissolved. By 1974 most underground newspapers in the U.S. had ceased publication. Although many of the members of the UPS and its successors were founded when the legendary urban underground papers were already dead or dying, their influence resonated through the 1970s and beyond, in scores of eclectic papers founded in small towns and suburbs, such as Long Island's Moniebogue Press and Suffolk StreetPapers, offering general audiences alternative perspectives on local news and culture, and in publications specializing in Native American politics (such as Akwesasne Notes), peace, ecology, etc.  The UPS and the women's liberation movement  As the underground press movement evolved, women's liberation, initially a non-issue in the male-dominated underground press, became an increasing focus. The UPS passed the following resolutions at its 1969 conference: These resolutions were a harbinger of staff rebellions by women that split several papers, including Rat, where the feminist faction seized control of the paper for several issues. A few papers, already weakened by staff burnout, poor finances and other factors, died in the wake of these schisms, while others lost revenue and circulation by barring sexual content and advertisements, which in any event were increasingly being spun off into tabloid sex papers like Screw.

Retrieved on October 6, 2013. After the 1994 release of Man's Ruin's first record, entitled Experimental Audio Research (EAR): Delta 6, Kozik worked with artists who he wanted to release; he also designed all of the sleeve art for the releases. The catalog of Man's Ruin is vast, including relatively famous bands such as The Hellacopters, Nebula, Kyuss, High on Fire, Entombed, Turbonegro, 13eaver, Queens of the Stone Age, and The Sex Pistols, to less known bands such as FuckEmos, Soulpreacher, Angelrot, and Los Cowslingers. The last record released was by Begotten, and the label was officially gone by 2002. The label's slogan was \\"Empty Pleasures and Desperate Measures since 1994\\". Operations Man's Ruin did not make signed contracts with the artists that they released, their operation was instead very open. Recordings were licensed for a time period of 2‚Äì5 years and all copyrights and publishing liberties were retained by the bands. Profits on releases were split 50-50 between band and label. The posters and album art from the Man's Ruin era are still very coveted and the limited print vinyl are constantly rising in their value due to two factors: the majority of covers were screen-printed]and numbered by Kozik and all records were released in editions of 5000 copies or less. The most sought-after records from the Man's Ruin catalog have consistently been The Desert Sessions records, which were released in highly limited editions on clear and colored vinyl. The CD versions of the first six volumes, as well as the rest of the entire Man's Ruin catalog have gone out of print with the demise of the label. Subsequent volumes of The Desert Sessions were released on Josh Homme's Rekords Rekords label. Man's Ruin specialized in producing and releasing limited edition 10\\" EP records. Often an album would be released in several different sets, such as the first release from Queens of the Stone Age in 1998, which was released on Man's Ruin in three editions: 2500 black, 300 green, 200 orange/yellow (a subsequent pressing of 198 copies on blue vinyl was made independently by the band as a \\"tour edition\\"). The vast majority of records released on the label were colored. The label was distributed in the US and UK by Mordam Records initially, and then a brief and unsuccessful switch was made to RED Distribution, which resulted in the demise of the label after a series of problems, and internationally by Swedish distributor and record label House of Kicks. Unlike most releases in music today, the international releases from Man's Ruin did not differ from the domestic American releases. However, it was not uncommon for the cover of a vinyl release to differ from that of the CD edition of the release. Decline and fall The label became defunct after a series of distribution changes and problems involving the label having outgrown its original distributor. Man's Ruin also lost its lease at the height of the Bay Area Dot-Com boom and was shut down for a period of several months while attempting to relocate its offices. This combination led to its demise at the end of 2001. The label's website was shut down a few months following its demise. Internet users who wished to view the Man's Ruin website were simply greeted with the message: \\"sorry mansruin never paid their bill and their site is no longer here.\\" They also did not pay their poster-printing crew for all of their overtime work as well. All operations ended in 2002. All licenses were returned to the various copyright holders at that time. Kozik then stopped working in the music scene and went on to enter the field of designing Urban Vinyl. Several bands (such as Fu Manchu, Turbonegro, Acid King and The Hellacopters) who have gained popularity after their work with Man's Ruin have re-released the albums they recorded there, independently or with other record labels.

The company was founded in 1893, and continues to produce ceramic tableware and art ware today. History Pickard China was incorporated in Edgerton, Wisconsin, in 1893. Wilder Austin Pickard (1857‚Äì1939) started the company in 1894 by offering his customers hand-painted giftware, artware, and eventually dinnerware. He moved the company to Chicago in 1897. The company was originally called Pickard China Studio and it specialized in hand-decorating dessert and tea sets. Pickard assembled a group of men and women china painters, many emigrating from Europe, to create this uniquely American style of hand-painted china. Many of the original artists were from the Art Institute of Chicago. At first all the porcelain was manufactured in Europe. Pickard would import the blank plates and decorate them in their studio. Wilder Pickard's son Austin Pickard began to work at the company and made the decision to begin manufacturing the blank plates and dishes themselves. In 1930 the first experimental china was made. Pickard also worked on making its own glazes. In 1937, after the experimentation was complete, a production facility was opened in Antioch, Illinois. Austin's son, Henry A.

Jemaa el-Fnaa ( SƒÅ·∏•at JamƒÅ æ al-FanƒÅ æ, also Jemaa el-Fna, Djema el-Fna or Djemaa el-Fnaa) is a square and market place in Marrakesh's medina quarter (old city). It remains the main square of Marrakesh, used by locals and tourists. Name The origin of its name is unclear: jamaa means \\"congregation\\" or \\"mosque\\" in Arabic, probably referring to a destroyed mosque on the site. Fna º or fan√¢ º can mean \\"death/extinction\\" or \\"a courtyard, space in front of a building\\". \\"fin√¢ º in Arabic commonly means \\"open area\\"; a straight translation would be \\"the gathering/congregation area\\". Other meanings could be \\"The assembly of death,\\" or \\"The Mosque at the End of the World\\".The Mosque at the End of the World, Tahir Shah, BBC Radio 3, 10 April 2010 Another explanation is that it refers to a mosque with a distinctive courtyard or square in front of it. A third translation is \\"assembly of the dead\\", referring to public executions on the plaza around 1050 CE. Saadian mosque which gave the square its present name One specific explanation endorsed by some modern historians comes from historical reports that the powerful Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur (ruled 1578-1603) had embarked on the construction of a monumental Friday mosque in the middle of the square. However, due to a downturn in fortunes (probably outbreaks of the plague) the sultan was forced to abandon the project part-way through and the mosque remained unfinished and fell into ruins. The ruined outline of its walls was apparently still visible in the 19th century and corresponded roughly to the current site of the \\"Souk Jdid\\" (the \\"new souk\\" just north of the food-stalls). In this way, \\"jamaa al-fna' \\" ostensibly refers to the place of the \\"ruined mosque\\". The name \\"Jamaa al-Fna' \\" appears in historical records for the first time in the 17th-century chronicle of the West African historian Abderrahman as-Sa'idi. As-Sa'idi claimed that the intended name of al-Mansour's unfinished mosque was jamaa al-hna, meaning \\"Mosque of Tranquility\\", but that after its abandonment it came to be known, by popular irony, as the \\"Mosque of ruination/annihilation\\", or jamaa al-fana'. (The word fana' in this case meaning a state of being extinguished or totally ruined, etc.)  History  Marrakesh was founded by the Almoravid Dynasty in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar and subsequently developed by his successors. Initially, the city's two main monuments and focal points were the fortress known as Ksar el- Hajjar (\\"fortress of stone\\") and the city's first Friday mosque (the site of the future Ben Youssef Mosque). The Ksar el-Hajjar was located directly north of today's Koutoubia Mosque. The major souk (market) streets of the city thus developed along the roads linking these two important sites and still correspond to the main axis of souks today. At one end of this axis, next to the Ksar el-Hajjar, a large open space existed for temporary and weekly markets. This space was initially known as Rahbat al-Ksar (\\"the place of the fortress\\"). Other historical records refer to it as as-Saha al-Kubra (\\"the grand square\\"), or simply as as-Saha or ar-Rahba. The Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf (ruled 1106-1143) soon afterwards constructed a palace directly south of and adjacent to the Ksar el-Hajjar, on the actual site of the later Koutoubia Mosque. One part of this palace was a monumental stone gate on its east side which faced towards the Rahbat al-Ksar. The gate likely played a symbolic role: it was the entrance to the palace for those seeking an audience with the sovereign, and it's possible the ruler himself would sit, enthroned, before the gate and publicly dispense justice on a weekly basis (a tradition which existed among other Moroccan and Andalusian ruling dynasties). The importance of the great public square in front of the royal palace thus led it to become the place for public executions, military parades, festivals, and other public events until long afterwards. After a destructive struggle, Marrakech fell to the Almohads in 1147. Following this, Jamaa el-Fna was renovated along with much of the city. The mosques, palace, hospital, parade ground and gardens around the edges of the marketplace were also overhauled, and a new royal kasbah (citadel) was erected further south by Ya'qub al-Mansur after 1184. As the Almohad rulers moved to the new kasbah, the old Almoravid palace and fortress fell out of use and was eventually torn down (in part to make way for the new Koutoubia Mosque). Subsequently, with the fortunes of the city, the Jemaa el-Fna saw periods of decline and also renewal. Despite the encroachment of new constructions on the edge of the square over time, it never disappeared due to its role as an open market area and as the site of public events. One attempt to fill a large part of the square is reported to have been made by the Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansour who attempted to build a monumental mosque in the square. The mosque would have likely followed the same model as the Bab Doukkala and Mouassine Mosques, being deliberately built in the midst of major traffic routes in the city, and would have been accompanied by a number of attendant civic and religious buildings. The mosque was never finished, however, possibly due to disasters like the plague epidemics during al- Mansour's reign. Construction was abandoned part-way through and what had been built fell into ruin and was taken over by market stalls and other occupants. (It is probably also the site of a modern shop complex, Souk Jdid, just north of the food-stalls today, whose outline has the same compass orientation as the mosques of al-Mansour's time.) This ruined mosque may have given the square its current name, Jemaa el-Fna (\\"Mosque of Ruins\\") (see previous section above). The Square During the day it is predominantly occupied by orange juice stalls, water sellers with traditional leather water-bags and brass cups, youths with chained Barbary apes and snake charmers despite the protected status of these species under Moroccan law.Bergin and Nijman (2014) Open, Unregulated Trade in Wildlife in Morocco‚Äôs Markets. TRAFFIC Bulletin Available from researchgate.net, accessed Mar 23, 2015. As the day progresses, the entertainment on offer changes: the snake charmers depart, and late in the day the square becomes more crowded, with Chleuh dancing-boys (it would be against custom for girls to provide such entertainment), story-tellers (telling their tales in Berber or Arabic, to an audience of locals), magicians, and peddlers of traditional medicines. As darkness falls, the square fills with dozens of food-stalls as the number of people on the square peaks. Steam rising from food stalls The square is edged along one side by the Marrakesh souk, a traditional North African market catering both for the common daily needs of the locals, and for the tourist trade. On other sides are hotels and gardens and cafe terraces, and narrow streets lead into the alleys of the medina quarter. Once a bus station, the place was closed to vehicle traffic in the early 2000s. The authorities are well aware of its importance to the tourist trade, and a strong but discreet police presence ensures the safety of visitors.  UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity  The idea of the UNESCO project Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity came from people concerned about the Jamaa el Fna. The place is known for its active concentration of traditional activities by storytellers, musicians and performers, but it was threatened by economic development pressures. In fighting for the protection of traditions, the residents called for action on an international level to recognize the need for the protection of such places ‚Äî termed \\"cultural spaces\\" ‚Äî and other popular and traditional forms of cultural expression. UNESCO encourages communities to identify, document, protect, promote and revitalize such heritage. The UNESCO label aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity. 2011 bombing Caf√© Argana the day after bombing Shortly before noon on April 28, 2011, a blast originating in a caf√© in the square killed 17 people and injured another 25. Initial reports blamed an accidental gas explosion, but officials later blamed \\"criminals\\" and \\"terrorists\\".

Early life  Cooper, born in Callington, Cornwall, in 1864, moved to Barnoldswick when she was a child, after her father Charles Coombe died of typhoid. In 1876, aged 12, she began working in the local textile mills at Barnoldswick. She left school at the age of thirteen and started work full-time in the mills.  Trade union and political activities  Cooper became active in trade union activities and took practical courses in laundry, hygiene and first aid and became a member of the Barnoldswick St John's Ambulance Committee in 1895. She was an early member of the Nelson Social Democratic Federation (SDF), and later founded a branch of the party in Brierfield. She joined the Women's Co-operative Guild in 1897 and the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage in 1900. In 1901, Cooper was elected to the Board of Guardians, as a joint SDF-ILP candidate. She became frustrated with the SDF's lack of interest in the suffrage movement, and moved away from the party, becoming a full-time organiser for the suffrage movement. In 1910 she was chosen to be one of four women to present the case for women's suffrage to H. H. Asquith, the then Prime Minister. In the provinces she with Ada Nield Chew and Margaret Aldersley were experienced labour activists in Lancashire.Sandra Stanley Holton, Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics in Britain, 1900-1918, Cambridge University Press (2002) - Google Books pg. 68 During the First World War Cooper developed the first ever Maternity Centre in Nelson, Lancashire. She was later elected to the town council and went on to become a local magistrate. She resigned from the Labour Party in the 1930s due to her belief that the party did not take a strong enough line against fascism.

Critic Jason Ankeny wrote, \\"With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop.\\"[] Ankeny, Jason, Allmusic.com profile of Last Poets; URL accessed February 01, 2007 Early life Abiodun was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and he moved with his maternal aunt and her new husband at age three to Queens, New York. At the age of 15, he attended a Yoruba Temple in Harlem. It was there that he was given the name by which he is best known. As a youth, Abiodun was influenced by jazz and gospel music played by his parents and the poems of Langston Hughes. The Last Poets The group was born on May 19, 1968, Malcolm X's birthday, when Abiodun and two others, David Nelson, Gylan Kain, read poetry in tribute to Malcolm X. The group was based in black nationalism and quickly became known throughout the African-American community. They are generally credited, along with Gil Scott-Heron, as being major influences on the development of hip hop. At one point, Oyewole was forced to leave the group as he spent four years in a North Carolina prison, convicted of larceny. After serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence, because of good behavior he was eligible for study release during the day. Oyewole continued his education at a nearby college (Shaw University, Raleigh) and earned his undergraduate degree. He subsequently went on to earn a doctorate from Columbia University in New York City, where he once served as a member of the faculty. Later years In 1994, Oyewole appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool, appearing on a track titled \\"This is Madness\\" alongside Omar Ben Hassen and Pharoah Sanders. The album was named \\"Album of the Year\\" by Time. Recently, Abiodun has been touring the world giving lectures on poetry and politics. Most recently he has taught at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.  Quotes  * \\"(Malcolm X) was our pathway to revolutionary understanding. Malcolm X went through a series of rites of passage - from Malcolm Little to Detroit Red to Satan to Malcolm X to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. All this because the man never stopped trying to develop and recognize the best of himself. He was self-determined. Malcolm was saying we need to be more. And we heard that. And he said it better than anybody ever said it. He made it clear to us. So all we wanted to do was to be disciples of Malcolm, in a sense, using poetry to illuminate the same values that he planted in our head.\\" On Malcolm X's influence on the Last Poets (2001).

After witnessing mass murders in the Belzec and Treblinka Nazi extermination camps, Gerstein gave a detailed report to Swedish diplomat G√∂ran von Otter, as well as to Swiss diplomats, members of the Roman Catholic Church with contacts to Pope Pius XII, and to the Dutch government-in-exile, in an effort to inform the international community about the Holocaust. In 1945, following his surrender, he wrote the Gerstein Report covering his experience of the Holocaust. He died of an alleged suicide while in French custody. Biography Kurt Gerstein was born in M√ºnster, Westphalia on 11 August 1905, the sixth of seven children in a Prussian middle-class family, described as strongly chauvinistic and \\"totally compliant to authority\\". His father, Ludwig, a former Prussian officer, was a judge and an authoritarian figure. Ludwig Gerstein proudly proclaimed that in his family's genealogical tree there was only Aryan blood and exhorted generations to \\"preserve the purity of the race!\\"Friedl√§nder, p. 10. As late as 1944, he wrote to his son Kurt: \\"You are a soldier and an official and you must obey the orders of your superiors. The person who bears the responsibility is the man who gives the orders, not the one who carries them out.\\"quoted in Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 4 Kurt Gerstein married Elfriede Bensch, a pastor‚Äôs daughter, on 31 August 1937. They had a daughter, Adelheid. Education Kurt was no more tolerant of discipline in secondary school than within the family. However, in spite of earning many bad reports, he managed to graduate at the age of 20. Going directly on to study at the University of Marburg for three semesters, he then transferred to the technical universities in Aachen and Berlin/Charlottenburg where he graduated in 1931 as a mining engineer.Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 11 While he was at Marburg, he joined, at his father's request, the Teutonia, \\"one of the most nationalistic student associations in Germany\\".Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 8 While he was uncomfortable with the frivolity of the fraternity students, he didn't seem to mind their ultra-nationalism. In 1936, he moved to T√ºbingen where he started studying medicine at the University of T√ºbingen and lived with his wife, Elfriede. Religious faith Although his family was not a particularly religious one, Gerstein received Christian religious training in school. While at university, almost as an antidote to what he saw as the frivolous activities of his classmates, he began to read the Bible.quoted in Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 13 From 1925 onwards, he became active in Christian student and youth movements, joining the German Association of Christian Students (DCSV) in 1925, and in 1928, becoming an active member of both the Evangelical Youth Movement (CVJM-YMCA) and the Federation of German Bible Circles, where he took a leading role until it was dissolved in 1934, after a takeover attempt by the Hitler Youth movement.Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 19 At first finding a religious home within the Protestant Evangelical Church, he gravitated toward the Confessing Church, which formed itself around Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller in 1934, as a form of protest against attempts by the Nazis to exercise increasing control over German Protestants.Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 35 His religious faith caused conflict with the Nazis and he spent time in prison and concentration camps in the late 1930s. Relations with the Nazi Party and Government Like many of his generation, Gerstein and his family were deeply affected by what they saw as the humiliation of Germany by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and they were thus attracted by the extreme nationalism of the Nazi Party. In July 1933, he enrolled in the SA, the original stormtroopers of the Nazi Party. Friedlander describes the contradictions in Gerstein's mind at the time: \\"Firm defense of religious concepts and of the honour of the Confessional youth movements, but weakness in the face of National Socialism, with acceptance of its terminology and shoddy rhetoric; acceptance, above all, of the existing political order, of its authoritarianism and its hysterical nationalism\\".Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 32 However, in early 1935, he stood up in a theater during a performance of the play Wittekind and vocally protested against its anti-Christian message. In response, he was attacked and beaten by Nazi Party members in the audience. On 4 September 1936, Gerstein was arrested for distributing anti-Nazi material, held in protective custody for five weeks, and ultimately expelled from the Nazi Party. The loss of Nazi Party membership meant he was unable to find employment as a mining engineer in the state sector. He was arrested a second time in July 1938, but was released six weeks later; no charges were filed against him. With the help of his father and some powerful party and SS officials, he continued to seek reinstatement in the Nazi Party until June 1939, when he obtained a provisional membership. World War II In early 1941, Gerstein enlisted in the SS. Explanations for this are varied and conflicting. One document indicates it was the result of his outrage over the death of a sister-in-law, who apparently was killed under the euthanasia program Action T4, directed at the mentally ill.'In memoriam Kurt Gerstein' by Hans-Georg Hollweg, 2010 repeats it was his aunt.quoted in Friedl√§nder, p. 80 where she is referred to as \\"aunt [sic]\\", although page 73 claims it was his sister-in-law Other documents suggest he had already made his decision before she died, and that her death reinforced his desire to join the SS to \\"see things from the inside\\", try to change the direction of its policies, and publicize the crimes they were committing.Pierre Joffroy, L'Espion de Dieu, Paris, Laffont, 2002, p. 133 (taken from French edition of Wikipedia) Browning describes him as \\"a covert anti-Nazi who infiltrated the SS\\",Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution: Electronic Edition, Browning, Christopher R. and in a letter to his wife, Gerstein wrote: \\"I joined the SS ... acting as an agent of the Confessing Church.\\"quoted in Friedl√§nder 1969, p. 215 Be≈Ç≈ºec (lower centre) on the map of German extermination camps marked with black and white skulls Because of his technical education, Gerstein quickly rose to become head of technical disinfection services, working with Odilo Globocnik and Christian Wirth on the technical aspects of mass murder in the extermination camps. He supplied hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) to Rudolf H√∂ss in Auschwitz from the Degesch company (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sch√§dlingsbek√§mpfung, or Vermin-Combating Corporation) and conducted the negotiations with the owners.Yahil 1991, pp. 356-357. On 17 August 1942, together with Rolf G√ºnther and Wilhelm Pfannenstiel, Gerstein witnessed at Belzec the gassing of some 3,000 Jews who had arrived by train from Lwow. The next day, he went to Treblinka, which had similar facilities, where he observed huge mounds of clothing and underwear removed from victims. At that time, motor exhaust gases were used for the purpose of mass murder in both extermination camps. Reporting Several days later, he had a chance encounter on the Warsaw to Berlin train with Swedish diplomat G√∂ran von Otter, who was stationed in Berlin. In a conversation that lasted several hours, he told the diplomat what he had seen and urged him to spread the information internationally.Friedl√§nder 1969, pp. 123-125 Von Otter did talk with high-ranking officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry, but Gerstein's revelations were never passed on to the Allies or to any other government. In the meantime, Gerstein tried to make contact with representatives of the Vatican, the press attach√© at the Swiss Legation in Berlin, and a number of people linked to the Confessing Church.Friedl√§nder 1969, pp. 128-129 One of his contacts was Dutch citizen J.H. Ubbink, whom he asked to pass on his testimony to the Dutch resistance. A little later, a member of the Dutch government in exile (in London) noted in his diary a testimony that is very similar to Gerstein's report. Gerstein's statements to diplomats and religious officials over the period of 1942 through 1945 had disappointingly little effect. After his surrender in April 1945, Gerstein was ordered to report about his experiences with the extermination camps, first in French, followed by two German versions in May 1945. Historian Christopher Browning has written: \\"Many aspects of Gerstein's testimony are unquestionably problematic. ...[In making] statements, such as the height of the piles of shoes and clothing at Belzec and Treblinka, Gerstein himself is clearly the source of exaggeration. Gerstein also added grossly exaggerated claims about matters to which he was not an eyewitness, such as that a total of 25 million Jews and others were gassed. But in the essential issue, namely that he was in Belzec and witnessed the gassing of a transport of Jews from Lwow, his testimony is fully corroborated .... It is also corroborated by other categories of witnesses from Belzec.\\" Distinguished French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, in Assassins of Memory, discusses such criticism.Assassins of Memory Pierre Vidal-Naquet, 1987. Ressources documentaires sur le g√©nocide nazi / Documentary Resources on the Nazi Genocide ¬© Michel Fingerhut, auteurs et √©diteurs, 1996-98 Arrest and death On 22 April 1945, two weeks before Nazi Germany's surrender, Gerstein voluntarily gave himself up to the French commandant of the occupied town of Reutlingen. He received a sympathetic reception and was transferred to a residence in a hotel in Rottweil, where he was able to write his reports. However, he was later transferred to the Cherche-Midi military prison, where he was treated as a Nazi war criminal. On 25 July 1945, he was found dead in his cell, an alleged suicide.Friedl√§nder, 1969, pp. 218‚Äì222 Depictions A highly detailed and researched biography by Pierre Joffroy called A Spy for God was published in English in paperback in 1971. His search for Christian values and ultimate decision to betray the SS by attempting to expose the Holocaust through informing the Catholic Church, is portrayed in the narrative film Amen., released in 2002, starring Ulrich Tukur as Kurt Gerstein and directed by Costa-Gavras. Amen. was largely adapted from Rolf Hochhuth's play The Deputy. William T. Vollmann's Europe Central, the National Book Award fiction winner for 2005, has a 55-page segment, entitled Clean Hands, which relates Gerstein's story. Thomas Keneally, author of Schindler's List, wrote a dramatic play, Either Or, on the subject of Gerstein's life as an SS officer and how he dealt with the concentration camps. It premiered at the Theater J in Washington, D.C. in May 2007. In 2010, a group of film students from Emory University produced a short film entitled \\"The Gerstein Report\\" that chronicled the events leading up to Gerstein's death. The film won Best Drama at the 2010 Campus MovieFest International Grande Finale in Las Vegas, Nevada. about the Gerstein Report Swedish musician Stefan Andersson wrote the song \\"Flygblad √∂ver Berlin\\" (\\"Flyers over Berlin\\"), on his 2018 album with the same name, about Gerstein and his meeting with the Swedish diplomat.

It does not include the various forms of art music, which in Russia often contains folk melodies and folk elements or music of other ethnic groups living in Russia. Ethnic styles in the modern era Soviet postage stamp depicting traditional Russian musical instruments. The performance and promulgation of ethnic music in Russia has a long tradition. Initially it was intertwined with various forms of art music, however, in the late 19th century it began to take on a life of its own with the rise in popularity of folkloric ensembles, such as the folk choir movement led by Mitrofan Pyatnitsky and the Russian folk instrument movement pioneered by Vasily Andreyev. In Soviet Russia, folk music was categorized as being democratic (of the people) or proletarian (of the working class) as opposed to art music, which was often regarded as being bourgeois. After the revolution, along with proletarian \\"mass music\\" (music for the proletarian masses) it received significant support from the state. In Post World War II Russia, proletarian mass music however lost its appeal, whereas folkloric music continued to have a widespread support among the population, inside and outside of the Soviet Union. However the authentic nature of folk music was severely distorted by the drive to 'professionalise' performers, regardless of the genre they worked in: thus all folk singers were obliged to both learn Western-style classical notation, and to learn to perform classical repertoire ‚Äì or else risk losing their right to perform as 'professionals'.Laura J. Olson, Performing Russia: Folk revival and Russian identity (2004), pp. 58‚Äì59 Russian spoons are used for traditional folk music in Russia () In the 1960s, folk music in Russia continued to receive significant state support and was often seen as the antithesis of Western pop music. The fact that numerous Soviet folkloric ensembles were invited for foreign tours raised the prestige of the folk performer to that of academic musicians, and in some cases even higher because access to the West and Western goods was very desirable. Ethnic (folk) music in Russia can often be categorized according to the amount of authenticity in the performance: truly authentic folk music (reproductive performances of traditional music), folkloric and \\"fakeloric\\" performance. Russia is a multi-ethnic country with some 300 different ethnic groups, many of them non-Slavic, living within its borders. This article deals specifically with just Russian ethnic music. Authentic folk music This music is closely tied in with village life and traditions. It was usually not performed by professional musicians. From the Central Committee's resolution of 1932,Olson (2004), p. 58 which prescribed musical literacy (in parallel to the drive to industrialise the Soviet Union), there has been a marked decline in authentic folk performance practice. Festivals, competitions and the work of ethnomusicologists have made attempts at preserving what has survived. In recent times there has been a movement by musicologists to study and reproduce authentic folk music in an authentic performance style on the concert stage. This movement in Russia is spearheaded by members of the faculty of folk music at the Moscow Conservatory under the direction of Dmitri Pokrovsky. More recently, Russian folk songs with strong religious (spiritual) components have been performed by singers like Zhanna Bichevskaya, Olga Arefieva and Elena Frolova Spiritual triptych Blessed are the humble in spirit , , ) Folkloric music This category includes music by groups led by music professionals, past and present, who have taken authentic musical material, and then arranged and performed it in a manner formulated by Vasily Andreyev and subsequently refined under Stalin's regime, yet widely accepted as 'authentically Russian' by Western audiences (conditioned, for instance, by performances by the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble). The category includes many of the regional folkloric ensembles and dance companies popular in the Russian Federation. Often these folkloric ensembles specialize in collecting and maintaining the folk music traditions of the area of their origins which they service. They perform in stylized stage costumes based on the authentic costume designs used in the village but modified for stage use. Most inauthentic ‚Äì but widespread ‚Äì was the practice of performing so-called Cossack prisiadki (low-squatting dances) in perfect synchronization; as Professor Laura J. Olson observes, 'this situation did not reflect actual Cossack traditions so much as it borrowed from the traditions of Russian ballet that dated to the late nineteenth century'.Olson (2004), p. 164 Artistic folklore music This includes music composed by city intelligentsia and professional composers in a folkloric manner. Much of the music of the Russian folk instrument orchestras can also be categorized in this group as it is based on academic music traditions and playing techniques only taking a folk element as its inspiration. As in all western folklore traditions, the distinction is difficult to draw, as in the 19th century, intellectuals would both collect folk music (not always being accurate about their source material) and conflate it with original compositions. In recent times music professionals who have completed diplomas in noted conservatories performing on Russian folk instruments are now questioning their \\"folkiness\\" when they perform, as none of their music was ever really performed originally by the (village) folk. Some now refer to their music as being academic folk music which to many academic musicians is an oxymoron. Vocal music Authentic Russian folk music is primarily vocal. Russian folk song was an integral part of daily village life. It was sung from morning to night, and reflected the four seasons and significant events in villagers' lives. Its roots are in the orthodox church services where significant parts are sung. Most of the population was also illiterate and poverty-stricken, so musical instruments were rare, and notation (which is more relevant for instrumentals than vocals) could not be read. Authentic village singing differs from academic singing styles. It is usually done using just the chest register and is often called \\"white sound\\" or \\"white\\" voice. It is often described as controlled screaming or shouting. Female chest register singers have only a low diapason of one octave to 12 notes. Chest register singing has evolved into a style used by many of Russia's folk choirs and neighbouring countries. It was pioneered by Pyatnitsky and Ukrainian folk choir director Demutsky in the early 1900s. Notable ensembles include the Pyatnitsky Russian Folk Chorus, the Northern Russian Folk Chorus, the Omsk State Russian Folk Chorus, the Alexandrov Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army and the Moscow Military Area Song and Dance Ensemble. Instrumental music Instrumental music for a long period was suppressed in Russia. In 1648, Tsar Alexis I of Russia under the influence of then-prevalent views in the Russian Orthodox Church banned the use of all musical instruments. At that time, it was stated that instruments were from the devil. Not easily verifiable today, but some historians also believe that skomorokhs, singing disrespectful songs about the Tsar to instrumental accompaniment, could have been the real reason. As a result of the ban, instrumental music traditions disappeared and did not have a fertile ground for development in Russia for many years. No musical instruments are used in Orthodox churches (in Russia). In the late 19th century, Vasily Andreyev, a salon violinist, took up the balalaika in his performances for French tourists to Petersburg. The music became popular and soon Andreyev had organized a club of balalaika players. This club grew into an orchestra, which in time grew into a movement. Alexey Arhipovsky is considered the modern-day Russian Paganini of the balalaika, but with a Pat Metheny approach. During his tours he has gained many admiring fans who compared him with Paganini and Jimi Hendrix: ‚ÄúOne would [sic] think that a three string instrument tuned E-E-A would have much potential, but you then haven‚Äôt heard Alexei Arkhipovskiy yet... [who] shows that he is the Russian Paganini.‚Äù http://www.todaystops.com/alexei-arkhipovskiy-playing-impressive-russian- balalaika ‚Äú[He] became a sensation immediately after the first appearance in front of the general public. He practically wrecked the Guitar festival ... showing incredible musical mastery. It was a real Theatre of inexpressible play and giddy performing numbers, MIME and gesture. Many hearers compared [him] no less than with great Jimi Hendrix\\" From a simple unsophisticated three-stringed instrument, combined with an awakening 'Russianness' in the last phases of the Tsarist Empire, the movement led to the development and implementation of many other Russian folk instruments. The Russian folk instrument movement had its resonance in the cultures of other ethnic groups within Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Bloc countries. Folk instrument orchestras appeared in Belarus, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Moldavia, and Romania. Traditional instruments Chordophones *Balalaika, a three-stringed, triangular sound-board, played with the fingers. It comes in many different sizes, prima being the most common. Two of the strings are tuned alike in descant, prima, secunda, and alto balalaikas. Balalaika *Domra, a small three- or four-stringed Russian variant of the mandolin with a rounded soundboard, plucked or strummed with a plectrum. It is also made in various orchestral sizes. Originally they were all three-stringed (E-A-D). The four-string variety was developed by in the early 20th century and became popular in Ukraine. *Gudok (also hudok), a three-stringed, pear- shaped Russian bowed instrument tuned in fifths which is usually held vertically. Gudok *Gusli, one of the oldest known Eastern Slav musical instruments, described by the Greeks as early as the 6th century AD. Many different varieties of this plucked string instrument exist. *Kolyosnaya lira (Wheeled Lyre), a Russian version of the hurdy-gurdy usually made with a violoncello body. *Semistrunnaya gitara (Semistrunka, Russian guitar), a seven string version of the acoustic guitar with its own preferred method of construction and unique open G major tuning.

Whistling is very common in Russian folk songs. The exclamation \\"Opa\\", also \\"Op op\\" and sometimes \\"Ota\\" is also a common characteristic of Russian folk music and is used by female and male singers.

Boothia Peninsula (; formerly Boothia Felix, Inuktitut Kingngailap Nunanga) is a large peninsula in Nunavut's northern Canadian Arctic, south of Somerset Island. The northern part, Murchison Promontory, is the northernmost point of mainland Canada. Geography Bellot Strait (Ikirahaq) separates the peninsula from Somerset Island to the north. Babbage Bay is on the east coast, as is Abernethy Bay, just to the south. The community of Taloyoak lies in the far south and is the peninsula's only significant population centre. Paisley Bay is on the west coast, as is Wrottesley Inlet (between Paisley Bay and Bellot Strait). Exploration John Ross was forced by ice to stop for four years at its easternmost point starting in 1829. He named it after his patron Sir Felix Booth. Ross encountered a large Inuit community whom he described as living in \\"snow cottages\\" (i.e., igloos) and immortalized in Ross's painting North Hendon. In 1831, his nephew James Clark Ross went overland and reached the north magnetic pole which was then on its western side. He also crossed west to King William Island. Henry Larsen's second successful traverse of the Northwest Passage passed through the Bellot Strait. Larsen deemed the strait too shallow for larger vessels and described how his vessel was almost crushed by ice floes when there was a change in the wind's direction. On his return voyage Larsen passed north of Somerset Island. References Further reading * Christie, Robert Loring.

Also while a member of various feminist groups she participated in actions including picketing a Miss America Contest, organizing a funeral for womanhood known as \\"The Burial of Traditional Womanhood\\", protesting sexual harassment at Madison Square Garden, organizing abortion speak outs, and disrupting abortion legislation meetings. In 1970, Firestone authored The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution. Published in September of that year, the book became an influential feminist text.Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip (1998). \\"Shulamith Firestone 1945‚Äì\\". The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political thinkers. 2nd edition. Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì67. The Dialectic of Sex and the ideas presented within it became important in both cyberfeminism and xenofeminism, as her ideas were a precursor for other subjects regarding technology and gender. In her writing career Firestone also helped write an edit a magazine called Notes. Her final written text was Airless Spaces written in 1998, which consisted of short stories all relating to her experience with mental illness and schizophrenia. A documentary called Shulie was created depicting Firestone during her time as a student, and it outlined her journey to becoming a feminist figure and important author. The original documentary featuring Firestone was never released, but a recreation of it was. Firestone struggled with schizophrenia after her retirement from activism and suffered from the illness until her death in 2012.  Early life  Firestone was born Shulamith bath Shmuel ben Ari Feuerstein in Ottawa, Canada. She was born on January 7, 1945Encyclopedia of World Biography. Ed. Tracie Ratiner. Vol. 27. 2nd ed. Detroit: Gale, 2007. p129-131. and was the second of six children and the first daughter of Orthodox Jewish parents Kate Weiss, a German Jew who fled the Holocaust, and Sol Feuerstein, a Brooklyn salesman. In April 1945, when Firestone was four months old, her father took part in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. When she was a child, the family Anglicized their surname to Firestone and moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Her father had become Orthodox when he was a teenager and, according to Susan Faludi, he exercised tight control over his children, with the zeal of a convert. One of her sisters, Tirzah Firestone, told Faludi: \\"My father threw his rage at Shulie.\\" She railed against the family's sexism; Firestone was expected to make her brother's bed, \\"[b]ecause you're a girl\\", her father told her. Laya Firestone Seghi, another sister, remembers father and daughter threatening to kill one another. Firestone's mother was described by her sister, Tirzah, as having a \\"passive view of femininity that was governed by what she regarded as \\"what Jewish women do.\\"  Education  Firestone attended Telshe Yeshiva nearby Cleveland. She then attended Washington University in St. Louis and in 1967 received a degree in painting from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). While in Chicago she started her first Women's Liberation group, Westside. Activism  Radical Feminism  Firestone was considered a radical feminist because she believed that the oppression of women is directly related to patriarchal western society. She was also heavily influenced by socialism and the work of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. In The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution she states, \\"Feminists have to question, not just all of Western culture, but the organization of culture itself, and further, even the organization of nature.\\" One of her radical beliefs was that she believed that women's oppression was acted out through control over women's bodies. In The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution (1970), she argues that we should invest in advanced technology in order to free women from childbirth. Her perspectives surrounding childbirth line up with the radical feminist thought at the time. Her perspectives in The Dialectic of Sex can also be seen as a precursor to cyberfeminism. Furthermore, her actions as a part of various feminist groups were seen as radical because they addressed issues around women's lives that were not discussed, especially by women. Some of these topics include the female orgasm as well as abortion.  Westside  In 1967, at twenty-two, Firestone, along with nearly two thousand other young activists, attended the National Conference for New Politics in Chicago. Here, Firestone met Jo Freeman and the two bonded over their shared outrage in response to the dismissal of women's issues at the conference. The two women put forth a resolution that called for equitable marital and property laws and ‚Äúcomplete control by women of their own bodies.‚Äù The women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion. They eventually managed to have their statement added to the end of the agenda, but it was not discussed. The director, Willam F. Pepper, refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about \\"the forgotten American, the American Indian\\". When five women, including Firestone, ran to the podium to protest, Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \\"Cool down, little girl; we have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\\" Shortly afterwards, Firestone and Freeman called a meeting which spawned into the first Chicago women's liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman's apartment on Chicago's west side. After a few months Freeman started a newsletter, Voice of the Women's Liberation Movement. It circulated nationwide (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the Chicago Women's Liberation Union. New York Radical Women In October 1967, after establishing the Westside group, Firestone moved to New York to flee a physically abusive boyfriend. In an unpublished work, Firestone recalls the abuse she had been subjected to, including being hit so hard, one of her teeth was knocked out of place. A manifesto was written for the group called the New York Radical Women's Principles. In the manifesto the group of participants were defined by their shared rejection of history based purely on a male perspective. It addressed how women's history had been oppressed and anyone who believed in feminism should work together to fight against that oppression. Also clearly stated within the principles was the group's belief that violence was not the appropriate action to attempt and create change. The New York Radical Women‚Äôs group instilled a psychology program that was considered radical. The program aimed to teach women to view themselves as more strong, independent and assertive. It was believed that by doing so women would not just be seen as subservient to men and it could combat the societal deprecation of women.  Redstockings, New York Radical Feminists  When NYRW formed \\"consciousness raising groups\\", Firestone and Ellen Willis co- founded the radical feminist group Redstockings, named after the Blue Stockings Society, an 18th-century women's literary group. Redstocking members included Kathie Sarachild (\\"Sisterhood is Powerful\\") and Carol Hanisch (\\"the personal is political\\"). The group supported history being portrayed by female perspectives, and believed that female writers could help protest the patriarchy. The women of the Redstockings thought that consciousness raising was a way to reform history and it was their version of resistance. They chose to raise their own consciousness by studying the lives of women, and they focused on aspects such as their childhood, jobs, and motherhood. In their groups they discussed their own personal experiences, instead of just focusing on written material on a subject. The women also applied certain generalizations and theories to themselves and observed real feelings and experiences to further their understanding. It was-understood that consciousness raising actions could help address old ideas and present society with new ones. From mass awareness could come action on a larger scale. However, it was not in the interest of the group to make the Redstockings a service organization or large membership organization. Similar to the New York Radical Women group, the Redstockings group believed it necessary to revolutionize society on a psychological level. They did this by getting women to explore their own individuality in order to resist male dominance. It was understood that if power could be taken back by individuals, then the process would expand to also affect society. Other actions taken by the group included putting out a journal, and protesting a Miss America contest to address the theme of women‚Äôs appearance that was prevalent within society. The group threw out objects associated with pain towards women for the sake of \\"beauty\\" such as high heels and girdles. This action was important because it helped start the Women's Liberation Movement. The Redstockings disbanded in 1970. Firestone co-founded New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) in 1969 with Anne Koedt after they left the Redstockings  Other actions  Firestone participated in many protests and political actions regarding feminist issues, and she even organized the first abortion speak out. The speak out was held in March 1969 and consisted of twelve women of whom Firestone had convinced to share their personal accounts with the issue. The feminist groups that Firestone had helped found also participated in protests and street performances during their existence. Some actions included disrupting abortion law hearings and collecting at establishments that prohibited the attendance of women without male accompaniment. The women also participated in the Burial of Traditional Womanhood that took place at the Arlington Cemetery 1968, in which a funeral was held for a dummy dressed to resemble the common housewife. Further actions were the releasing of mice in Madison Square Garden during a bridal fair, or the ogling of men on Wall Street to draw attention to sexual harassment. Writing Notes With others from New York Radical Feminists, Firestone created and edited a feminist periodical, Notes, producing Notes from the First Year (June 1968), Notes from the Second Year (1970), and, with Anne Koedt as editor while Firestone was on leave, Notes from the Third Year (1971).Firestone, Shulamith (June 1968). ed. Notes from the First Year. New York: New York Radical Women, June 1968. Firestone, Shulamith (1970). ed. Notes from the Second Year. New York: New York Radical Women. Koedt, Anne; Firestone, Shulamith (1971). ed. Notes from the Third Year. New York: New York Radical Women. Firestone utilized Notes as a form of radical, feminist propaganda that enlightened and educated female readers. The notes included topics such as the vaginal orgasm and The Personal is Political, which created discussion for radical feminism. Within the journal, Firestone also published The Women's Rights Movement in the US: A New View in 1968. The essay focused on Firestone's belief that the movement had the ability to become revolutionary. The Dialectic of Sex The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution (1970) became a classic text of second-wave feminism. This was Firestone's first book and was published when she was just 25. In the book, Firestone sought to develop a materialist view of history based on sex. Also notable within the book is the ideal society Firestone creates, one void of the oppression of women. The Dialectic of Sex was perceived to be a Utopian manifesto dedicated to exploring some to the contradictions present in the United States at the time to an extreme. The Dialectic of Sex was met with both applause and outrage and it even made the best sellers list. Firestone synthesized the ideas of Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and Simone de Beauvoir into a radical feminist theory of politics.Rich, Jennifer (2014) [2007]. Modern Feminist Theory. Penrith: Humanities-Ebooks LLP, pp. 21ff. She also acknowledged the influence of Lincoln H. and Alice T. Day's Too Many Americans (1964) and the 1968 best- seller The Population Bomb by Paul R. Ehrlich. Within her book, Firestone asserts that modern society could not achieve true gender equality until women's biological traits are separated from their identity. The Dialectic of Sex was largely influenced by the existing views of Simone de Beauvoir. Firestone supported the belief that the women were limited by the need for them to have children, and by reproducing they could not be individualistic. She also connected the ideas in her book to de Beauvoir's view that motherhood oppressed women, and women became victims in a patriarchal based society. Firestone believed in the importance of recognizing and creating awareness for the history and predecessors of the feminist movement, so she dedicated her book to Simone de Beauvoir. She also makes the claim that Freud and Marx had ignored what she called the ‚Äúsex class‚Äù, the domination of women given their biological differences. Gender inequality stems from the patriarchal societal structures imposed upon women because of their bodies, she argued, particularly the physical, social, and psychological disadvantages caused by pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing. She expanded on Marx's views of class to include sex as a class, which she believed was created due to biological distinctions associated with reproduction. Just as Marx connected class differences to divisions in labour, Firestone associated the differences in the classes of sex to be caused by the division of labor and roles regarding procreation. Unlike many other feminists who argued the female existence is a superior one, Firestone only freely accepted that there are biological differences between men and women. However, she made it clear that these differences, though real, are not to be treated as a foundation for prejudice or superiority of one group over another. Firestone also insists that to be human is to outgrow nature, saying: \\"we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on the grounds of its origin in Nature.\\" The abolition of the sex class requires that women take control of the means of reproduction.Sydie, R. A. (1994). Natural women, cultured men: a feminist perspective on sociological theory, University of British Columbia Press, p. 144. She regarded pregnancy and childbirth as \\"barbaric\\" (a friend of hers compared labor to \\"shitting a pumpkin\\") and the nuclear family as a key source of women's oppression. Contraception, in vitro fertilization and other medical advances meant that sex would one day be separated from pregnancy and child-rearing, and women could be free. However, Firestone hoped to take reproduction one step farther and completely separate it from the female body. She urged the emergence of a new type of artificial reproduction, referred to as the ‚Äúbottled baby,‚Äù through which women could be freed of the hindrance of childbirth, just as men are. Although in vitro is the closest option we have to such a phenomenon, we have not yet reached Firestone's end goal. Firestone also criticizes the dynamic that exists between heterosexual parenting and child development. She argued that children are hindered in their abilities to develop because of their education, predetermined positions in the social hierarchy, and \\"lesser importance\\" in comparison to the adult figures in their lives. Parents controlled these aspects of their children's lives. This, in turn, has increased maternal expectations and obligations, which is something Firestone desired for society to outgrow. This dependency of maternal figures makes the child(ren) more susceptible to physical abuse, and deprives them of the opportunity to work towards being economically independent and possess or feed into sexual urges. It was her vision to solve these problems by eliminating families for the raising of children, and instead have children raised by a collective. Specifically Firestone wanted to eliminate what was coined nuclear families, which were household that consisted of a husband, wife, and their child(ren). She believed that these families were a form of social organization and created inequality within a family as the children were considered subordinates to their parents. Airless Spaces By the time The Dialectic of Sex was published in 1970, Firestone had largely ceased to be politically active. She withdrew from politics in the early seventies, moved to Saint Marks Place, and worked as a painter. In the late eighties she became mentally ill. In 1998 she published Airless Spaces, a collection of fictional short stories based on her experiences being hospitalized for schizophrenia. Inspired by personal experience, this work highlights the lives and struggles of different characters in New York City battling with mental illness and poverty. Each narrative in the book addresses the difficulties of mental disorder, as well as the feelings of \\"shame, humiliation, fear, loneliness, and anxiety\\" that accompany it. There is a consistent presence of instability in the lives of each character in regards to economic and social status, along with mental state. \\"Airless Spaces\\" is said to be a reflection of the marginalization Firestone experienced resulting from her radical feminist ideals and lifestyle, as well as the hardships of individuals to escape from the dehumanizing aspects of the mental health field.  Struggle with mental illness  Although in her era of political activity, Firestone advocated for consciousness raising groups and the unity of women, she later suffered from schizophrenia, which may be correlated with chronic isolation and loneliness. In May 1974, Firestone was called home to St. Louis following the news of her brother Daniel's death. She was told he died in a car crash, but later came to know the true cause of death, a gunshot wound to the chest. Her brother's apparent suicide shook the family's Jewish Orthodox beliefs and sent Shulamith Firestone into a battle with mental illness. Firestone refused to attend her brother's funeral and stated, ‚Äúwhether murder or suicide, afterlife or no, [his death] contributed to my own growing madness.‚Äù Following the death, Sol and Kate Firestone planned to make aliyah to Israel, prompting an argument that ultimately resulted in Shulamith's disavowal of her parents. She stated in a certified letter that she had ‚Äúdissolve[d] [her] tie of blood.‚Äù In 1987, Shulamith's sister Tirzah stated, ‚Äúit was when our father died that Shulie went into psychosis. She lost that ballast he somehow provided.‚Äù Firestone's condition was officially diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia, following which, she was repeatedly hospitalized at Beth Israel Medical Center. Dr. Margaret Fraser, her psychiatrist, stated that she suffered from a particularly heinous form of Capgras syndrome, which caused her to believe that the people in her life ‚Äúwere hiding behind masks of faces.‚Äù Eventually, friends and acquaintances, under the guidance of Fraser, her psychiatrist, began a community effort to watch over and care for Firestone as her mental health deteriorated. When Fraser moved and her confidant Lourdes Cintron fell ill, the community of women disbanded, leaving Firestone to her psychosis and death. Death On August 28, 2012, Firestone was found dead in her New York apartment by the building's owner. Alerted by neighbors, who had smelled an odor from her apartment, her superintendent peered in through a window from the fire escape and saw her body on the floor. Her landlord, Bob Perl, said she had probably been dead about a week. According to her sister, Laya Firestone Seghi, she died of natural causes, but because of her family's staunchly Orthodox views, an official autopsy was never done to confirm or deny starvation as the cause of death. According to reports, she lived in a reclusive fashion and had been in ill health. In a commemorative essay by Susan Faludi published several months after Firestone's death, The New Yorker magazine further detailed the circumstances of her demise, citing her decades- long struggle with schizophrenia‚Äîalong with speculation of self-induced starvation‚Äîas probable contributing factors. A memorial service was arranged in her memory.  Legacy   The Dialectic of Sex  The Dialectic of Sex is still used in many women's studies programs. Its recommendations, such as raising children in a gender neutral fashion, mirror the ideals Firestone set out to achieve. Many of the main ideas within the book are still prominent in the feminist debate on the use of technology advancements in reproduction. The work of Shulamith Firestone is considered an origin to the combination of science and technology with critical thinking from a feminist lens. Her ideas are still shared and discussed including her belief of the necessity for more women to pursue careers in engineering and science. Firestone's views can also be found in scientific advancements such as the production of artificial sperm and eggs and how their production may lead to the elimination of differences between the sexes. = Cyberfeminism and Xenofeminism = The Dialectic of Sex also has a legacy in the branch of feminism known as cyberfeminism. Her book was a precursor to contemporary activities by cyberfeminists. Specifically it was Firestone's argument that women needed technology in order to free themselves from the obligation of reproducing. Firestone was an important theoretician who connected gender inequities to the view of women as purely child bearers, and she pushed for the increase in technology to abolish gender oppression. The ideas that Shulamith presented about technology differed to those of many other writers during her time, as she introduced technology as a tool to help ignite a feminist revolution, rather than act as a form of male violence. Firestone's work helped to spread a discourse on the general ideals of cyberfeminism. Shulamith Firestone also became a predecessor to Donna Haraway, and her cyberfeminist texts.. Both of their works have similar views and aspirations, as they both address biology and are attempting to eliminate it through the use of technology. The two women envisioned a future in which individuals are more androgynous and the views of the female body are reconstructed. Similarly the works also connect how these changes affect or would affect labor roles. Shulamith's book created an understanding for gender transformation, and these themes are still a basis of cyberfeminist writing presently. Themes in The Dialectic of Sex have ties in xenofeminism as well. Firestone's desire to free women from the burden of reproduction and eliminate the use of sex organs to define an individual's identity has connections to the ambition of xenofeminists to create a society in which all individuals are not assigned traits based on their supposed sex. Helen Hester, one of the members who helped write The Xenofeminism Manifesto, related her contributions to the ideas on feminism and technology presented by Firestone. She even credited Shulamith as one of the key theorists who contributed to the xenofeminism discourse.  \\"Shulie\\"  During her studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago Firestone was the subject of a student documentary film. Never released, the film was rediscovered in the 1990s by experimental filmmaker Elisabeth Subrin, who did a frame-by-frame reshoot of the original documentary. It was released in 1997 as Shulie winning two awards, including the 1998 Los Angeles Film Critics Association award. The film depicts Firestone as a young student and her journey into becoming one of the most notable second-wave feminists and feminist authors of the 20th century. In 1998, the film was honored with the Independent/Experimental Film and Video Award by the Los Angeles Film-Critics Association, receiving acknowledgement alongside films like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", A Bug's Life, and Rushmore. Two years later, the documentary received the \\"Experimental Award\\" from the New England Film and Video Festival. The documentary was praised by The New Yorker for its use of dialectical thought (a concept derived from Firestone's work) in the production of a film set decades prior to its filming.

Title page of Scipione Gentili's Opera Omnia, 1763-1769 Scipione Gentili (; 1563 ‚Äì August 7, 1616) was an Italian law professor and a legal writer. One of his six brothers was Alberico Gentili, one of the fathers of international law. Born at San Ginesio, Scipione Gentili left Italy at the age of 16 when he had to emigrate together with his father and his brother Alberico because of their Protestant beliefs. Together with his brother and his father, he settled in England, and, in the early 1580s, published several books with the London printer John Wolfe, all dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney. Of them, the most important was a partial Latin translation of Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata. Scipione spent his life in Germany. He studied law at the universities of T√ºbingen, Wittenberg, Leiden, Heidelberg and Basel. He reached the doctorate in 1589 and started to teach law at the university of Heidelberg. Quarrels with his Italian compatriot Giulio Pace made him leave Heidelberg and go to the German university in Altdorf bei N√ºrnberg. There, the famous jurist Hugues Doneau (Hugo Donellus, 1527‚Äì1591), who had been among his teachers at Leiden, procured him a professorship, which Scipione kept until his death. While Alberico Gentili was, at least at the outset of his career, a staunch supporter of the traditional bartolist method of legal interpretation, Scipione was influenced by French jurists like Doneau and Jacques Cujas, who applied the methods of humanist philology to legal texts. Gentili's works, which fills eight quarto volumes in the 1763 edition, have not only legal writings but also wrote commentaries on St. Paul's Epistle to Philemon and on the Apologia of Lucius Apuleius as well as a translation into Latin of and Annotazioni (in Italian) on Torquato Tasso's epic Gerusalemme liberata. Among his legal works are two voluminous treatises De donationibus inter virum et uxorem (on donations between husband and wife, which were illegal and void under Roman law) and De jurisdictione (on jurisdiction). Gentili also edited the final part of Doneau's Commentarii de Iure Civili, thereby securing the completion of the influential work, which the author had not been able to finish before his death. Gentili rendered a similar service to his brother Alberico, whose Hispanica Advocatio he edited in 1613. During his lifetime l, Scipione Gentili was held in high esteem all over Europe. His fame probably even surpassed that of his brother. Pope Clement VIII is said to have offered him the possibility to return to Italy and to teach at Bologna without having to give up his Protestant beliefs, an offer that Gentili did not accept. However, after his death, Scipione Gentili was quickly forgotten. Unlike his brother Alberico, who was rediscovered in the 19th century, Scipione Gentili is still waiting for a re-evaluation of his work. References * Angela De Benedictis (1999). Gentili, Scipione.

He is remembered for roles on the television programs Little House on the Prairie, Highway to Heaven and Carter Country.  Early career  Born in Santa Barbara, California, to an Armenian mother and Ted French, an actor and stuntman who appeared in westerns in the 1940s, French later appeared with his father in one episode of Gunsmoke, titled \\"Prime Of Life\\", in 1966, as well as a war film in 1963 called The Quick and The Dead which was produced by the Theatre Arts department of Los Angeles Valley College in Van Nuys which Victor French attended. Ted French died in 1978. Following in his father's footsteps, French also began his television career as a stuntman in mostly westerns and anthology shows. During this period, he guest starred in some thirty-nine television series. Though he had an uncredited role as an office clerk in the film The Magnificent Seven, French's first real western role was the 1961 episode \\"The Noose\\" of the syndicated series Two Faces West; his fellow guest star on the segment was L.Q. Jones, another actor destined to become well known in western roles. French was cast as Larrimore in the episode \\"Fargo\\" on the ABC/Warner Brothers western series The Dakotas. French appeared twenty-three times on Gunsmoke, often playing a crook, whether dangerous or bumbling. On October 25, 1971, he portrayed a cold-hearted gunman named \\"Trafton\\" who, while robbing the communion vessels in a Roman Catholic church, murders a priest. As the clergyman lies dying, he forgives his killer, a development which dogs Trafton, who holds human life in low regard, for the entire episode until he is shot to death by Marshal Matt Dillon. French guest starred in another episode, titled Matt's Love Story, in which Dillon falls in love with a character played by Michael Learned. The appearance led to French's re-teaming with Learned in a guest-actor role on The Waltons a year later. In \\"The Fulfillment\\", French plays a blacksmith named Curtis Norton whose wife could not have children and subsequently adopts an eight-year-old orphan boy who has come to spend the week on Walton's Mountain. This led to his being cast in his most well-known role as Mr. Edwards in the series based on the books of Laura Ingalls Wilder, titled Little House on the Prairie, beginning in 1974. In other work, French also starred opposite Elvis Presley in the 1969 western, Charro! and played the recurring character \\"Agent 44\\" in the NBC series Get Smart in 1965‚Äì1966, where he portrayed an undercover spy who showed up in the worst, most unlikely of places (like a mailbox or a porthole in a boat) and appeared in a few episodes of Bonanza, with Michael Landon. The two young actors found considerable common ground and became each other's best friend as a result. Shortly before being teamed up once again, French made a guest appearance on Kung Fu as a corrupt, bigoted sheriff in 1973. French also guest starred in episode 24 (\\"Trial by Fury\\") of season 2 of Mission: Impossible, in which he played the informer in a prison. In 1976, French appeared in an episode of the western series Sara. In 1982, French appeared in the film An Officer and a Gentleman as the stepfather of protagonist Paula Pokrifki, played by Debra Winger. Work with Michael Landon French is most widely known for costarring with Michael Landon on two television series. He appeared on Little House on the Prairie (1974‚Äì1977), (1981‚Äì1984) as Isaiah Edwards (French also directed some episodes of Little House). He appeared on Highway to Heaven (1984‚Äì1989) as Mark Gordon. From 1977-79, he left Little House to star as a small-town Georgia police chief in Carter Country. When the series ended, the actor was surprised that Landon was agreeable to his returning to the character of Mr. Edwards. French appeared in Episode 8 of Season 6, in Episode 8 of Season 8, then returned full-time, starting with Episode 19 of Season 8. According to interviews with Cindy Landon, and Kent and Susan McCray on the A&E; DVD release of Highway to Heaven Season 3, French and Michael Landon were \\"crazy about each other\\", indicating that they always made each other laugh and enjoyed each other's company. Cindy Landon mentions that French was a quiet and reclusive kind of guy as opposed to Landon's outgoing personality. Death French died at the age of 54 on June 15, 1989 at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital in Los Angeles, California, after a three-month battle with lung cancer. In 1998, French was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.

It has its headquarters in Denver, Colorado with additional sites in Sunnyvale, California; Santa Cruz, California; Huntsville, Alabama; and elsewhere in the US and UK. The division currently employs about 16,000 people, and its most notable products are commercial and military satellites, space probes, missile defense systems, NASA's Orion spacecraft, and the Space Shuttle external tank. History The Lockheed Missile Systems Division was established in Van Nuys, Ca. in late 1953 to consolidate work on the Lockheed X-17 and X-7. The X-17 was a three-stage solid-fuel research rocket designed to test the effects of high mach atmospheric reentry. The X-17 was also used as the booster for the Operation Argus series of three high-altitude nuclear tests conducted in the South Atlantic in 1958. The Lockheed X-7 (dubbed the \\"Flying Stove Pipe\\") was an American uncrewed test bed of the 1950s for ramjet engines and missile guidance technology. Lockheed Missiles Division moved from Van Nuys, CA, to the newly constructed Palo Alto, Ca. facility in 1956, then to the larger Sunnyvale facility in 1957. The Polaris missile was the first major new program for both locations, followed later by satellite programs, thus the name change to Lockheed Missiles and Space Division. The UGM-27 Polaris was a Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) built during the Cold War by Lockheed Missiles & Space Division in Sunnyvale, California. for the United States Navy. The Polaris program started development in 1956, with its first flight test in 1958. In 1962, the USS Ethan Allen successfully fired a Polaris A-1 missile against a test target in 1960. The SLBM has evolved through Polaris (A2), Polaris (A3), Poseidon (C3) Trident I (C4) and ongoing with today's Trident II (D5). All of these were designed and managed at the Sunnyvale CA facility. Together, these are known as the Navy's Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Program. Lockheed Martin has been the sole provider of FBM missiles since 1956. Lockheed Missiles & Space became prime contractor for elements of Military Satellite System (WS 117L), calling for the development of a strategic satellite system. The core element was Lockheed's Agena spacecraft, the world's first multipurpose spacecraft with boost and maneuvering engines, also acting as the 2nd stage of the launch vehicle and/or carrier vehicle for the reconnaissance system. WS-117L and Agena lead to the development of the Corona (satellite)‚Äîthe nation's first photo reconnaissance satellite system, collecting both intelligence and mapping imagery from August 1960 until May 1972. Over 800,000 images were taken from space, with imaging resolution originally equaling , later improved to . The program was declassified in February 1995. Approximately 365 Agena spacecraft supported a wide variety of missions, from NASA's early interplanetary efforts; to the US Navy's SeaSat, the USAF's Corona, Midas and Samos series between January 1959 and February 1987, when the last Agena D was launched. The Corona Program led to the development of the Gambit and Hexagon programs. The first Gambit system, launched in 1963, was equipped with a focal length camera system. The second system, Gambit 3, was equipped with the camera system that included a focal length camera. The system was first launched in 1966 and provided the U.S. with exquisite surveillance capabilities from space for nearly two decades. Hexagon was first launched in 1971 to improve upon Corona's capability to image broad denied areas for threats to the United States. Twelve of the 19 systems flown also carried a mapping camera to aid in U.S. military war planning. In addition, Gambit and Hexagon were launched aboard rockets built by Lockheed Martin heritage companies. Gambit 1 was launched on an Atlas rocket with the orbiting Agena D upper stage and Gambit 3 was launched using a Titan III B booster. Hexagon was launched aboard the larger Titan III D rocket. Lockheed achieved the first-ever hit-to-kill of an ICBM reentry vehicle in 1984 with the Homing Overlay Experiment, using the Kinetic Kill Vehicle (KKV) force of impact alone to destroy a mock warhead outside the Earth's atmosphere. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV could extend a folded structure similar to an umbrella skeleton of diameter to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the Minuteman RV with a closing speed of about at an altitude of more than . Further testing produced the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System, the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) and the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV). The Titan I was the first version of the Titan family of rockets, first developed in October 1955, when the US Air Force awarded the then Martin Company in Denver, Co., a contract to build an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). It was the United States‚Äô first two-stage rocket and formed an integral part of their strategic deterrent force. In the early 1960s the rocket was adapted to launch the Gemini capsule that carried two people at a time into space. Titan succeeded in launching 12 Gemini spacecraft and has also helped to launch the Viking missions to Mars, Voyager 1 and 2 and most recently Cassini to Saturn. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket powered by RP-1 and LOX. The Titan I and Atlas ICBMs using RP-1/LOX fuel did not have a quick launch sequence. They took about 30 minutes to fuel up and fire. Most Titan rockets were derivatives of the Titan II ICBM. The Titan II ICBM had one W-53 warhead with a 9 megaton yield, making it the most powerful ICBM on-standby in the US nuclear arsenal. The Titan III was a modified Titan II with optional solid rocket boosters. It was developed by the U.S. Air Force as a heavy-lift satellite launcher to be used mainly to launch U.S. Military payloads such as DSP early-warning, intelligence (spy), and defense communications satellites. The Titan IV is a stretched Titan III with non-optional solid rocket boosters. It could be launched either with the Centaur upper stage, with the IUS (Inertial Upper Stage) or without any upper stage. It was almost exclusively used to launch U.S. Military payloads, though it was also used to launch NASA's Cassini probe to Saturn in 1997. Mergers and acquisitions RCA Astro Electronics, a division of RCA, was formed in the late 1950s and went on to become one of the leading American manufacturers of satellites and other space systems, including the world's first weather satellite, TIROS, launched in 1960. The spacecraft design and manufacturing facility was located in East Windsor, New Jersey. In 1985, two members of the Astro Electronics engineering staff, Bob Cenker and Gerard Magilton, were selected to train as NASA Payload Specialists for the Space Shuttle Columbia mission designated as STS-61-C. The primary goal of the flight was to deliver a communications satellite, RCA Americom's Satcom KU-1, designed and built at the Astro-Electronics facility, into orbit. Cenker was selected as a member of the flight crew, and Magilton was assigned as the back-up. When Columbia launched on January 12, 1986, Bob Cenker became RCA Astro-Electronic's first astronaut. Following the destruction of Space Shuttle Challenger with the next Shuttle mission, civilian Payload Specialists were excluded from flying Shuttle missions until 1990. By that time, RCA had been purchased by General Electric, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space. The facility operated as GE Astro Space until it was sold to Martin Marietta in 1993. Then in 1995 it became part of the newly named Lockheed Martin following the Martin Marietta merger with the Lockheed. Soon after the merger, Lockheed Martin announced that the New Jersey facility would be closed. The New Jersey facility completed work on the in-process projects over the next few years, transferring the majority of work to other Lockheed Martin facilities, including the heritage-Lockheed facility in Sunnyvale, California, and a newly built facility in Newtown, PA. The facility that began as RCA Astro Electronics closed for good in 1998. Lockheed Martin Space Systems is now headquartered in Denver, but still does considerable operations from Sunnyvale. Also located near Sunnyvale is the main office of Lockheed Martin's space research and development group, the Advanced Technology Center (ATC), formerly the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory (LPARL). On August 31, 2006, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Corp., based in Bethesda, Md., as the prime contractor to design, develop, and build Orion, US-European spacecraft for a new generation of explorers. As of May 21, 2011, the Orion spacecraft is being developed for crewed missions to Moon and then to Mars. It will be launched by the Space Launch System. In November 2010, Lockheed Martin Space Systems was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts, and propulsion technologies. In June 2014, the company was contracted by the United States Air Force on a fixed-price basis to build the fifth and sixth Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, known as GEO-5 and GEO-6, for the Space Based Infrared System at a cost of $1.86 billion. In June 2015, Lockheed Martin announced plans to expand its workforce at Cape Canaveral, Florida in order to support the U.S. Navy's Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile program.

It is situated in rural landscape about two miles to the west of Coxhoe, two miles North of Cornforth and around five miles south of Durham. It is part of the civil parish of Cassop-cum-Quarrington. It is ideally located for speedy access to both Durham city, the A1M, and Teesside via Sedgefield. Despite its close proximity to many local amenities and towns, residents enjoy the peaceful lifestyle of living in a semi-rural location, with lovely views across the fields. Tursdale currently consists of a single street of housing, Ramsay Street, a school house and a small 4 home conversion of the former school which closed in the 1960s. A second street, School Street, a row of bungalows and other dwellings were demolished in the 1960s and early ‚Äô70s. Standalone Farm, whose final remnants probably went at about the same time, may once have been a moated house of some antiquity. All houses in Tursdale, other than farms, were originally built to accommodate the miners who worked at the former Tursdale Colliery across the road, which was sunk in 1854. Before that, the more ancient settlement of Tursdale had been around Tursdale House and Hett Mill, to the north east. The colliery was merged with Bowburn Colliery in 1931. When that closed, in 1967, the NCB Tursdale Workshops continued to provide a regional, and then a national, resource for the NCB. They closed in 1994, during Margaret Thatcher's government, and the site was converted to general business use. Behind this small business park lie the railway lines. Tursdale has been proposed as a suitable site for a road-rail freight interchange due to its proximity to both the East Coast Main Line, the mothballed Leamside Line and the A1(M) motorway.

Pomponia is the female name for the gens Pomponia of Ancient Rome. This family was one of the oldest families in Rome. Various women bearing this name lived during the Middle and Late Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. The oldest known Pomponia was mother of a famous Roman general; the second and third were related to each other. The relationship between these women, if any, is not known. They descended from 'Pomponius', the first son of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome. Pomponia, mother of Scipio Africanus Pomponia (fl. 212 BC) was a Roman woman who lived in the 3rd century BC. She came from a Roman noble family who were of plebeian status, and were prominent knights or equestrians. She was the daughter of the consul Manius Pomponius Matho, consul in 233 BC (who appears to have died in 211 BC), and was married possibly around 237 BC to Publius Cornelius Scipio, second surviving son of the Roman censor Lucius Cornelius Scipio of a prominent patrician family. Her husband later became a general and statesman during the Second Punic War and was killed in battle in Hispania in 211 BC. By her marriage, Pomponia was the mother of at least two sons, the famous Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major (236 BC-184 BC/183 BC) and Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (fl. 183 BC). Livy's brief mentions of Pomponia show her to be a devout religious woman, much preoccupied with her household duties.Sil. Ital. xiii. 615 ; comp. Gellius. vii. 1. Pomponia, sister of Titus Pomponius Atticus Pomponia was a Roman woman who lived in the first century BC and was an only sister to Cicero‚Äôs friend the Roman Knight Titus Pomponius Atticus. She was an aunt to Titus Servilius Pomponianus, Caecilia Attica and a great-aunt to Vipsania Agrippina (first wife to future Roman Emperor Tiberius). Cicero through his effective mediation was able to arrange for Pomponia to marry his younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero. Quintus and Pomponia married in 68 BC. Pomponia bore Quintus a son of the same name. Quintus and Pomponia had a long unhappy marriage and they constantly quarrelled. Pomponia was a woman of strong character. Their constant quarrelling greatly upset Cicero and he mentioned this in his letters to Atticus. Cicero tried to assist his sister-in-law and his brother to resolve their problems, but Cicero naturally supported his brother. When the younger Quintus Tullius Cicero grew up, he tried (encouraged by his uncles) to reconcile his parents, but was unsuccessful. Pomponia and the elder Quintus divorced in later 45 BC or early 44 BC. In December 43 BC, Cicero, Quintus, and Quintus minor were executed on the orders of Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. As an act of decency, Antony handed over Philologus, a former slave and traitor to Cicero, to Pomponia. According to Plutarch, Pomponia punished Philologus for his treachery with terrible punishments, which included forcing him to cut off pieces of his own flesh, then roasting and eating them.http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2826.htmlPlutarch ‚Äì Cicero Pomponia, mother of Vipsania Agrippina Pomponia Caecilia Attica, usually called Caecilia Attica (born 51 BC), was the daughter of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the first wife of general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, and mother of Vipsania Agrippina. She was also the niece of the second Pomponia, sister-in-law of Cicero. Pomponia, wife of Aulus Plautius Pomponia Graecina was a Roman woman who lived in the 1st century. She was the wife of Roman General Aulus Plautius, a distant relative of Julia Livia (daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar) and granddaughter of Emperor Tiberius. Famous speculation associates her with early Christianity in Rome, as in the novel and film Quo Vadis?. Pomponia, Vestal Virgin under Caracalla Pomponia Rufina was a Vestal Virgin under the Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211‚Äì217). Caracalla ordered her death, because she violated her vow of chastity.http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2826.html Pomponia, daughter of Annia Aurelia Faustina Pomponia Ummidia was the daughter of Annia Aurelia Faustina and a descendant of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the wife of consul Flavius Antiochianus.

They are found not only along the shorelines, but also on the many rocky islands and floating blocks of ice that dot the Caspian Sea. In winter, and cooler parts of the spring and autumn season, these marine mammals populate the Northern Caspian. As the ice melts in the warmer season, they can be found on the mouths of the Volga and Ural Rivers, as well as the southern latitudes of the Caspian where cooler waters can be found due to greater depth. Evidence suggests the seals are descended from Arctic ringed seals that reached the area from the north during an earlier part of the Quaternary period and became isolated in the landlocked Caspian Sea when continental ice sheets melted. Description Adults are about in length. Males are longer than females at an early age, but females experience more rapid growth until they reach ten years of age. Males can grow gradually until they reach an age of about 30 or 40 years. Adults weigh around ; males are generally larger and bulkier. Their dental formula is . The skull structure of the Caspian seal suggests it is closely related to the Baikal seal. In addition, the morphological structures in both species suggest they are descended from the ringed seal which migrated from larger bodies of water around two million years ago. Caspian seals are shallow divers, with diving depths typically reaching and lasting about a minute, although deeper and longer dives have been recorded, with at least one individual seen at depths in excess of . They are gregarious, spending most of their time in large colonies. Caspian seals can be found not only along the shorelines, but also on the many rocky islands and floating blocks of ice that dot the Caspian Sea. As the ice melts in the warmer season, they can be found on the mouths of the Volga and Ural Rivers, as well as the southern latitudes of the Caspian where cooler waters can be found due to greater depth. In winter, and cooler parts of the spring and autumn season, these marine mammals populate the Northern Caspian. In the first days of April, spring migration to the southern part of the Caspian Sea begins with mature female seals and their pups, during this migration hungry seals eat the fish in the nets. Male mature seals stay in the northern Caspian Sea longer and wait until the moulting is completed. In summer, seals find empty places in the western part of Apsheron for resting. In the eastern part, the most crowded place used to be the Ogurchinskiy Island, but by 2001, fewer than 10 pups were recorded on Ogurchinsky, some of which were killed by people on the island. Diet Caspian seals are primarily piscivorous. They eat a variety of food depending on season and availability. A typical diet for Caspian seals found in the northern Caspian sea consists of crustaceans and various fish species, such as Clupeonella engrauliformis, C. grimmi, C. delicate caspia, Gobiidae, Rutilus rutilus caspicus, Atherina mochon pontica, and Lucioperca lucioperca. Caspian seal adults eat about of fish a day and almost a metric ton of fish per year. In autumn and winter, Caspian seals prey mostly on sculpins, gobies, and crustaceans while inhabiting shallow waters in the northern part of the sea. During the summer, in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, they eat herring, roach, carp, sprat, and smelt. When Caspian seals live in estuaries, they eat large amounts of the freshwater species, Sander lucioperca. Other prey include shrimp, crab, and silversides. Being one of the top predators in the ecosystem, Caspian seals had hazardous chemicals found inside their bodies such as heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, and radionuclides. Behavior Caspian seals are shallow divers, typically diving for about one minute, although scientists have recorded Caspian seals diving deeper and for longer periods of time. After foraging during a dive, they rest at the surface of the water. In the summer and winter, during mating season, Caspian seals tend to live in large groups. At other times of the year, these seals are solitary. During the summer, however, they make aggressive snorts or use flipper waving to tell other seals to keep their distance. Little else is known about their behavior. Reproduction Male and female Caspian seals are monogamous. Among breeding seals, a lack of fighting for a mate seems prevalent. In late autumn, Caspian seals travel to the northern part of the Caspian Sea where the water is shallow and frozen to give birth in secluded areas on ice sheets after a gestation period of 11 months. Normally, pregnancy rates are 40 to 70%, but are currently at an all-time low of 30%. In late January to early February, female seals give birth to one pup each. Similar to other ringed seals, these pups are born with white pelages and weigh about 5 kg. Their white coats are molted at around three weeks to a month. Male pups become sexually mature after six to seven years, whereas female pups sexually mature after five to seven years. Newborn pups are not fully grown until 8 to 10 years after they are born. Breeding begins a few weeks after the birth of last year's pup around late February to mid March. Breeding usually occurs after weaning of a newborn pup, but can begin while the pup is still nursing. Caspian seals migrate back to the southern part of the Caspian Sea after the breeding season and molting in late April because the north begins to warm with constant ice melting. The southern region of the Caspian Sea has deep, colder waters where the seals spend the summer months. Threats Sea eagles are known to hunt these seals, which results in a high number of fatalities for the juveniles. They are also hunted by humans for subsistence and commerce. , commercial icebreaker routes have passed through areas with high Caspian seal pup concentrations, which may contribute to loss of habitat. In a three-week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the killing of numerous seals near Astrakhan. An estimated 17 to 40% of the seals in the area were killed, but not eaten. For threats related to migration, high density seal aggregations were recorded in November 2009 and 2010 CISS helicopter surveys in Kenderli Bay, but the integrity of seal habitat in Kenderli Bay is currently threatened by an imminent large-scale coastal resort development. This resort development can be a serious disturbance for seals. The local authorities have been advised about the need to preserve the seal habitats in the bay, but it is not yet clear what steps are planned to achieve this. According to the present study, Kosa Kenderli plays an important role for the seasonal migration of the Caspian seals and is recommended to be a protection area. Due to increased industrial production in the area, pollution has had an effect on the survival of the Caspian seal. From 1998 to 2000, the concentration of zinc and iron increased dramatically in the tissue of dead, diseased seals. This suggests these elements are causative agents in compromising the Caspian seal's immune system. A century ago, their population was estimated at 1.5 million seals; in 2005, 104,000 remained, with an ongoing decline of 3‚Äì4% per year. Canine distemper virus Several recent cases of large numbers of Caspian seals dying due to canine distemper virus have been reported, in 1997, 2000, and 2001. In April 2000, a mass die-off of Caspian seals was first reported near the mouth of the Ural River in Kazakhstan. It spread south to the Mangistau region, and by the end of May, more than 10,000 seals had died along the Kazakhstan coast. High death rates were also recorded in May and June along the Apsheron peninsula of Azerbaijan and the Turkmenistan coast. Clinical signs of infected seals included debilitation, muscle spasms, ocular and nasal exudation, and sneezing. Necropsies performed in June 2000 on eight Azerbaijan seals revealed microscopic lesions, including bronchointerstitial pneumonia, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid tissues. Similar lesions were also discovered on four seals from Kazakhstan. Morbillivirus antigen was also detected in multiple tissues, including lung, lymph nodes, spleen, brain pancreas, liver, and epithelial tissue of the reproductive, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts. Such tissue lesions are characteristic of distemper in both terrestrial and aquatic mammals. Tissues from 12 carcasses found in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan were examined for morbillivirus nucleic acid. Sequences from the examination showed that canine distemper virus, which is part of the genus Morbillivirus, was the primary cause of death. The sequences also proved that seals from widely separated regions of the Caspian Sea were infected by the same virus. This finding established spatial and temporal links between the seal deaths in these regions. The sequences were also identical to that of canine distemper virus found in the brain tissue of a seal that died in 1997 and showed no morbillivirus lesions. This suggests persistence of canine distemper virus in the Caspian seal population over a span of several years or repeated spillover from the same terrestrial reservoir. Another study in 2000 using 18 Caspian seal corpses found several concurrent bacterial infections that could have contributed to the illness of the affected seals. These include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus phocae, Salmonella dublin, and S. choleraesuis. Corynebacterium caspium, a new bacterium, was identified in one of the seals, and poxvirus, Atopobacter phocae, Eimeria- and Sarcocystis-like organisms, and a Halarachne species were identified in Caspian seals for the first time. The study also asserts that the ‚Äúunusually mild‚Äù winter that preceded the die-off in 2000 could have contributed to its cause ‚Äúthrough increased ambient air pressure and accelerated disappearance of ice cover at the breeding areas in the northern Caspian Sea.‚Äù See also *Tyuleniy Archipelago and Tyuleny Island, both named after the Caspian seals References *Jukka Palo: Genetic diversity and phylogeography of landlocked seals *OBIS-SEAMAP - Species Profiles External links *Caspian seal factsheet at pinnipeds.org *\\"Caspian Seal under threat of extinction\\", Baztab newspaper.

It is situated a short distance to the north-west of Chester-le-Street. It is the site of a former coal mine and a closed railway station primarily used to service both Pelton Fell and Pelton, a village at the opposite end of Station Lane, although very few traces of either remain today, except in some of the street names. Primarily residential, it does have a small village shop, a doctor's surgery and a newly open community centre called the Brockwell Centre. There is a Bar/Restaurant at the far end of the village, called The Moorings, with an attached hotel, which opened in April 2007. This is the area traditionally referred to as Hett Hills. The Pelton Fell Working men's club was closed and demolished in March 2008, several years after the Colliery Inn was closed and demolished only 100 yards from the same location. A small industrial estate called Stella Gill was established in the late 1980s and primarily provides start up premises for small businesses. A substantial proportion of the village is made up of pre- and post-Second World War council housing, many of which (particularly in the north of the village) have been bought under the right to buy scheme. The village is split into two sides by an area locally called 'The Battery'. On the Station Lane side is Pelton Fell memorial Park, housing a war memorial, tennis courts, children's play area and a bowling green, home to the local bowling club. Pelton Fell Football club play home games on the football pitches situated at the rear of Park View and Battle Green, just off Station Lane. Adjacent the park, on Station Lane, the Miner's Institute was built in 1889 and later expanded in 1909 to cope with the rise in population. The institute was used for many social activities and local clubs up until the 1990s when it fell derelict and was later destroyed by fire. There are now four newly built detached houses on the site. A Durham County Council-sponsored redevelopment of the village began in 2004, with a significant number of council houses, and a small number of private houses, demolished to make way for more modern accommodation, which is to a mix of social housing and private housing.

It is situated half a mile north of Low Etherley and 2.5 miles west of Bishop Auckland. Etherley Incline Railway The hamlet is built on part of the site of the former Etherley Incline Railway, opened in 1825. Initial distribution of coal from the Witton Park Colliery was undertaken by horse and cart, but due to the volumes of coal extracted and cost of distribution, a new method of transport was required. George Stephenson was contracted to build a suitable railway to bring the coal down from the hills, and constructed the Etherley Incline Railway with iron rails held on stone blocks. A stationary beam engine controlled the descent of wagons that ran from the colliery to the River Gaunless. Horses then pulled the wagons to the foot of the Brusselton Incline, which descendend into . From here, the Stockton and Darlington Railway transported it to Newport on the River Tees. The Etherley Incline closed in 1843, and today it is designated by English Heritage as an ancient monument, and as such is protected. History Phoenix Row was built in the 1840s, originally of local sandstone, Stobart brick and red pantiles to house families of miners and farmworkers. Nearby Witton Park Ironworks also provided some employment until its closure. The people of Phoenix Row built their own Methodist chapel (now a private house) and they had a cricket team which played at the New Inn Fields. Phoenix Row's bracing climate was credited in the local press for breeding tall, strong sportsmen - \\"sturdy six-footers\\". At one time the majority of the houses in the hamlet were occupied by members of just three families - Watsons, Grays and Stubbs - and their in-laws. In the 1960s Phoenix Row was threatened with the dreaded Category \\"D\\" notice, a death sentence for many post-industrial County Durham mining communities. However the determined villagers fought the Category \\"D\\" notice tooth and nail. Showing remarkable community spirit, they united under the banner of P.R.I.D.E. (the Phoenix Row Improvement & Development Effort) and succeeded in getting the Category D threat lifted, modernising their homes and saving their village for future generations.

Already in the 18th and the 19th centuries, Puchberg was a popular destination for visitors. With the opening of the Schneeberg Railway, tourism became more important than farming, which traditionally had been the primary source of revenue. The spa is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Lower Austria. History About its early history, little is known.

Formed in 2000, the band consists of Tommy Giles Rogers Jr. (lead vocals, keyboards), Paul Waggoner (lead guitar, backing vocals), Dustie Waring (rhythm guitar, lead guitar), Dan Briggs (bass, keyboards), and Blake Richardson (drums). Their debut eponymous album was released through Lifeforce Records in 2002, shifting to Victory Records for subsequent releases until their signing to Metal Blade in 2011, where Between the Buried and Me released their first extended play, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues that year, and its full-length follow-up The Parallax II: Future Sequence the following year. Their seventh studio album, Coma Ecliptic, was released in 2015. Their eighth album Automata I was released March 9, 2018, and their ninth album, Automata II, was released July 13, 2018.  History   Formation and eponymous album (2000‚Äì2002)  The band was formed in 2000 in Raleigh, North Carolina after the demise of the metalcore bands From Here On and Prayer for Cleansing, of which Rogers, Waggoner, and Goodyear were members. Nick Fletcher and Jason King subsequently joined on guitar and bass respectively. The name \\"Between the Buried and Me\\" was chosen after a section of lyrics in the Counting Crows song \\"Ghost Train\\". Between the Buried and Me's first release was a demo containing three songs, all of which were re-recorded for the band's self-titled debut album, released through Lifeforce Records in 2002. The song \\"Aspirations\\" became the band's first music video. The album was not initially successful but did manage to catch the attention of Victory Records, to which they later signed. Victory reissued the album in 2004 as an enhanced CD. The band toured in support of their first album with Canadian metalcore group The End.  The Silent Circus, Alaska, and The Anatomy Of (2003‚Äì2006)  In August 2003, Between the Buried and Me traveled to Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts to record their second record, The Silent Circus, released in October the same year. It was later re-released in 2006 with a live DVD of the band's performance at The Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on July 17, 2005. Mark Castillo played drums on The Silent Circus, replacing Goodyear. After the release of The Silent Circus, the band went through numerous members before the current lineup was assembled for their third album, Alaska. On drums, Mark Castillo was replaced by Jason Roe, and later by Blake Richardson. On guitar, Fletcher was replaced by Shane Blay, and later by Dustie Waring. And on bass, King was replaced by Kevin Falk, and later by Dan Briggs. This remains the current lineup. In September 2005, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska. The album released the songs \\"Selkies: The Endless Obsession\\", \\"The Primer\\", and \\"Backwards Marathon\\" as singles. In the following year, the band released their first cover album, The Anatomy Of, a collection of covers of bands that influenced Between the Buried and Me, including Metallica, King Crimson, Pantera, Faith No More, Queen, Pink Floyd, Earth Crisis, Counting Crows, and Soundgarden. In early 2006, Between the Buried and Me was on tour supporting Bleeding Through along with Every Time I Die and Haste the Day. They were also on the Ozzfest 2006 Second Stage. In late 2006, they were on the Radio Rebellion Tour headlined by Norma Jean.  Colors and The Great Misdirect (2007‚Äì2009)  In September 2007, Between the Buried and Me released their fourth studio album (fifth if including The Anatomy Of), Colors. Band members called it \\"a 65 minute opus of non stop pummeling beautiful music... we have described this release as 'new wave polka grunge'.\\" The band also described the album as \\"adult contemporary progressive death metal\\". In September 2007, after the release of Colors, the band went on tour with Animosity and Horse the Band. Giant (now known as BraveYoung) also supported their shows in the USA. The run concluded with their November 4 appearance at the Saints and Sinners Fest in Asbury Park, New Jersey. In December 2007, they again embarked on a headlining tour, supported by August Burns Red and Behold... The Arctopus. The band were also the main support on The Dillinger Escape Plan's 2008 UK tour. Between the Buried and Me were one of the acts that took part at \\"Progressive Nation '08\\", the first in what became an annual progressive music festival, also featuring Dream Theater, Opeth, and 3. Starting in summer 2008 and continuing in the fall, they performed as a supporting act for Children of Bodom's US headlining tour, alongside The Black Dahlia Murder. In early December 2008, they went on a short 4-show tour around the Carolinas and Georgia (US) with other Carolina- based bands, such as He Is Legend, Advent, and Nightbear. Between the Buried and Me finished a month-long tour of Australia on January 9 with headliners Bleeding Through, As Blood Runs Black, In Trenches and The Abandonment. In September 2009, Between the Buried and Me performed a Canadian Tour with Killswitch Engage and In Flames co-headlining, along with the support of Protest the Hero. On May 31, 2009, the group went into the studio to record their fifth album (sixth if including The Anatomy Of), The Great Misdirect. They released the single \\"Obfuscation\\" on September 29 and the album on October 27.  The Parallax and Metal Blade Records (2010‚Äì2014)  In February 2010, Between the Buried and Me supported Mastodon along with Baroness on their US headlining tour. During the summer of 2010, they were on the Cool Tour with As I Lay Dying, Underoath, War of Ages, The Acacia Strain, Architects, Cancer Bats and Blessthefall. In early 2010, Between the Buried and Me toured across North America with Cynic, Devin Townsend, and Scale the Summit. Afterwards, they traveled to Europe supporting Lamb of God, along with Job for a Cowboy and August Burns Red. In February 2011, Between the Buried and Me were confirmed to play at the New England Metal & Hardcore Festival on Saturday, April 16 in Worcester, MA. They were main support for Hatebreed. In April and May 2011 they headlined a tour featuring Job for a Cowboy, The Ocean and on select dates Cephalic Carnage. Between the Buried and Me stated their move from Victory to Metal Blade Records, and quickly released an EP entitled The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues on April 12, 2011. In May, Victory Records announced the release of a greatest hits album as a three-disc set. On January 16, 2012, Between the Buried and Me revealed that work on the full-length second part to The Parallax had begun and was later released as The Parallax II: Future Sequence on October 9, 2012.

On the band's cover album, The Anatomy Of, the band pays tribute to many of their diverse influences, including Sepultura, Metallica, Blind Melon, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Queen, King Crimson, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Pantera, Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode, Earth Crisis, and The Smashing Pumpkins.

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 113. It is situated a few miles west of the town of Darlington. It is on the site of a Roman fort of AD 260‚Äì270, which was built at the point where Dere Street crossed the River Tees. Part of the fort is under the village green. The village is sited where the York-Newstead Roman road known as Dere Street crosses the River Tees. The excavated Roman fort is open to the public and the remains of Piercebridge Roman Bridge over the Tees now lie around south of the current course of the river, approximately east of Piercebridge, at the east side of Cliffe, Richmondshire. Toponym Piercebridge is named after its Roman bridge or brigg: in 1104 it was Persebrig; in 1577 it was Priestbrigg. It is thought that pierce comes from pershe, meaning osiers, perhaps because the bridge was at least partly made of osier twigs in 1050 when the name is first recorded. Alternative suggested meanings, of \\"priest\\" and the name \\"Piers\\", would be too modern in origin for such an old place name. History Roman The Romans built a fort here to defend the crossing against the Brigantes. The Roman fort known as Magis, Morbium or Vinovium is now located under the village green. It was sited adjacent to Dere Street, at the point where the Roman road crossed the River Tees. The fort was occupied continuously from about 70 CE to at least the fifth century. A civilian settlement was to the east of the fort in Tofts Field. A Roman bath house was incorporated into St Mary's chapel (now on private land). Archaeological television programme Time Team has been here in 2009, attracted by Piercebridge Roman Fort in 2009. Following the departure of the Romans in 410CE, the area in and around the fort remained inhabited for about another century. The plain it sits on in the Tees Valley was the site of Battle of Catraeth. The kingdom of Catraeth was composed of the descendants of the Brigantes. Medieval East side of bridge, from Piercebridge,looking south There was no permanent inhabitation in the area until the Normans arrived in the mid 11th century. 16th century onwards There was no medieval Piercebridge parish, but there was a chapel recorded in 1546. The name of White Cross Farm and cottage may come from the 17th century apocryphal tale that one of the Dukes of Cleveland demanded the whitewashing of houses on his land so that he could recognise his own property should he require shelter during a storm while hunting. The 18th-century farmhouse, Piercebridge Grange, may be on the site of a monastic grange. It was tenanted by James Rawe, gentleman, in 1847. It is now a Grade II listed building, but was derelict by 2008. The Battle of Piercebridge was partly fought on the bridge, when on 1 December 1642 a small Royalist contingent including William Cavendish defended it against Parliamentarians led by Lord Fairfax. St Mary's church and churchyard were used for 115 extant memorials and burials from 1836 to 1987. In 2001 the Piercebridge area suffered in the foot and mouth epidemic. By 1887, the village had grown to cover of which 17 were water. It had a population of 206, a railway station and a post office. Since then it has lost the railway station, gained few residents, and retained its post office. A clock in the George Hotel inspired Henry Clay Work's 1876 song \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\". The clock was said to have been owned by two brothers named Jenkins. When one brother died, the clock began losing time, and it stopped forever upon the death of the other. Preservation Within the village there are numerous Georgian and Victorian cottages: some painted white or cream; some of one storey only. There are several Grade II listed buildings in the village and its environs, including White Cross Farmhouse, White Cross Cottage, Carlbury Bridge, Piercebridge Grange Farmhouse, the Church of St Mary and its wall and gate, and numbers 2, 28, 29 and 30 on The Green. The Grange farm buildings, however, were developed into residential properties in 2008. Piercebridge Roman Bridge and the medieval chapel ruins on Roman foundations behind Bath House in Tees View are listed Grade II*. The bridge carrying the main B6275 road was originally built in the early 16th century and was widened in 1781; it is Grade II* listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The village green contains some very old trees, and in the river are trout and greyling. At the north end of the village, near the A67 is the Carlbury Arms pub. There is also a Farmway Country Store and Piercebridge Feed Company, retailing rural supplies. The dismantled Tees Valley Railway has become the Tees Valley Railway Path. Church services are held at St Mary's every other week, and there is also a Wesleyan Methodist chapel. Transport Originally Dere Street crossed the Tees further upstream, but in 1771 a flood washed away the remains of the old Roman bridge, and in 1789 a new bridge replaced the ferry. The 1806 map shows Dere Street as the main route via Piercebridge between Richmond and Bishop Auckland, although the Ripon-Durham route went via Darlington. The 1904 map shows the route diverted via Staindrop, and that part of Dere Street between Piercebridge and Bishop Auckland had become a minor road. This was possibly due to the advent of the NER Darlington and Barnard Castle railway (1856) whose station closed to passengers in 1964. According to the land-usage map of 1942, this was an area of arable land and pasture, and the urbanisation around Darlington had not yet begun to encroach.

It is situated a few miles north-east of Durham. The population as taken at the 2011 census was 2,534. Pittington is made up of the neighbouring settlements of Low Pittington and High Pittington, which were developed for coal mining by Lambton Collieries from the 1820s. High Pittington, the larger of the two, now includes the old hamlet of Hallgarth. Hallgarth is a conservation area, designated in 1981. It is a small conservation area focussed on the Church of St Laurence, a Grade I listed building, and Hallgarth Manor Hotel (Grade II). The civil parish of Pittington includes both villages and the neighbouring village of Littletown. Pittington Hill is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Parish church St Laurence's is a mediaeval parish church in the Diocese of Durham. It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The present building dates from around 1100, and is known for its 12th century north arcade and wall-paintings. In a Victorian restoration by Ignatius Bonomi in 1846-7, the chancel was extended, and the aisle walls, porch and chancel were rebuilt. The church is a Grade I listed building. The parish of Pittington is now part of a united benefice with St Mary Magdalene, Belmont, County Durham. In the churchyard is a war memorial, unveiled in 1920. It is a calvary cross by Bowman and Sons, and designed by W. H. Wood. The memorial is Grade II listed. Education Pittington Primary School is a school of approximately 180 pupils ranging from 3 to 11 years of age. The school logo is one hedgehog. The Hallgarth murder The water mill, about half a mile to the south west of Hallgarth, was the scene of the 1830 murder of Mary Ann Westrop, a 17-year old servant girl. At 6 o'clock in the evening of 14 August 1830,Durham County Advertiser Friday 13 August 1830, Page: 6 while the mill owners were at church, Thomas Clarke, a 19-year old servant, in a distressed state, alarmed residents of Sherburn with the information that six Irishmen had broken into the mill house at Hallgarth. He claimed that they had ransacked the house for money and then assaulted him with a poker before brutally murdering Westrop. Returning to the mill with the people he had informed, the girl's body was found in the kitchen with several brutal wounds including a cut to her throat from ear to ear. It was found that money had been stolen from the household and that a whitewashed tool had been used to break into the drawers containing the money. It was then discovered that Clarke's room had recently been whitewashed, and in that room was found a blunt piece of metal which fitted the tool used in the robbery. It was realised that Clarke bore no signs of an attack upon him. Huge crowds turned out for Clarke's trial at Durham on 14 February 1831, and despite Clarke's calm plea of innocence, he was found guilty. On 28 February he was hanged. His last words were; \\"Gentlemen I am innocent, I am going to suffer for another man's crime\\". A wall memorial to Westrop was erected in St Laurence's Church. The Hallgarth murder became the subject of a local broadside ballad; \\"Eighteen hundred three times ten, August the eighth that day, Let not that Sunday and that year, From memory pass away, At Hallgarth Mill near Pittington, Was done a murder foul, The female weak- the murderer strong, No pity for her soul. Her skull was broke, her throat was cut, Her struggle was soon o'er; And down she fell, and fetched a sigh, And weltered in her gore. Her fellow servant, Thomas Clarke, To Sherburn slowly sped, And told a tale that strangers six Had done the dreadful deed. Now, woe betide thee, Thomas Clarke! For this thy coward lie; A youth like thee for girl like her Would fight till he did die. \\"They've killed the lass,\\" it was his tale,\\" and nearly have killed me\\"; But when upon him folk did look, No bruises could they see.\\" Notable people *Francis Barmby - cricketer *Jimmy Dickenson ‚Äì professional footballer *Harry Hooper (footballer, born 1933) *Jack Percival (footballer, born 1913) References *Margot Johnson. \\"Pittington\\" in Durham: Historic and University City and surrounding area.

At Rice University from 1996 to 1998, he earned All-American honors in 1997 and 1998. In 1998, he hit 25 home runs and drove in 91 runs in only 221 at bats, and batted .394 with a .504 on-base percentage and a .828 slugging percentage. He also had a 30-game hitting streak. He is the all-time Rice leader with 20 career triples, and 2nd with 59 home runs, 243 RBIs, 499 total bases, and a .737 slugging percentage, trailing only Lance Berkman in each category. Professional career Los Angeles Dodgers (1998‚Äì2003) Crosby was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League in the 1st round (23rd overall) of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft for amateur entries. His best seasons in the minors in the Dodgers system were 1999 (.296 with 19 stolen bases in A+ ball), 2000 (27 stolen bases in A+ ball), 2001 (.302 with 22 stolen bases in Double-A), and 2003 (.361 in Triple-A). Crosby was finally called up by the Dodgers in 2003, while he was batting .361 with a .410 on-base percentage and .635 slugging percentage (1.045 OPS) in AAA. Nevertheless, he still struggled to find significant time in the majors as the Dodgers favored Rickey Henderson in a reserve role over him. Following a dozen at bats in Los Angeles, he was traded to the New York Yankees on July 31, 2003, along with Scott Proctor for Robin Ventura. New York Yankees (2004‚Äì06) Crosby played primarily as a starting outfielder (mostly in RF‚Äîwhere he has never made an error in the Major Leagues‚Äîand CF) for the Yankees. =2004= In 2004, after having made the team due to a strong spring training performance in which he hit .385 with two home runs and eleven RBIs,Yanks roster set, Bubba makes it, MLB.com, March 29, 2004 Crosby gained a large amount of media and fan attention when, in his first series against the Chicago White Sox, he hit two home runs with five RBI in first five at-bats and made a diving catch.Lofton, Williams Likely to Displace Crosby, ESPN Notably, the first home run came in his first at bat as a Yankee and the second secured Mike Mussina's 200th career win.BASEBALL; Big Hit With Yankee Fans, Crosby Hits Homer and Wall, New York Times, April 12, 2004 Nevertheless, upon the return of outfielder Kenny Lofton from the disabled list, Crosby was sent down to minors from where he would be called up several times. He ultimately received only 53 at-bats on the season, hitting .151 overall. He made both the ALDS and ALCS rosters as a reserve outfielder and pinch runner. =2005= In 2005, Crosby performed well in spring training again and made the team for the second year in a row but again found difficulty staying in the majors at the beginning of the season. He was optioned down to the Clippers on July 8, 2005, but returned to the Yankees on August 18. Crosby returned to the Yankees wearing jersey number 18 because his previous number, 19, had been assigned to the newly acquired Al Leiter. Crosby's season made a dramatic turn for the better in the final month of the season, however. After having worked with Don Mattingly to shorten his swing, Crosby finished his 2005 season with the strongest performance of his career, hitting .321 in 23 September games while consistently starting and .345 (20 for 58) over his final 31 games of the season. On September 19, 2005, in his first start of the year against a left-handed pitcher, he hit his career first walk-off home run, against Eric DuBose of the Baltimore Orioles, leading off the bottom of the 9th inning by sending a breaking ball over the right-center field fence.Crosby Show and Yanks Win Emmy For Drama, New York Times, September 20, 2009 On October 10, 2005, Crosby, after having started several postseason games, was involved in a collision in Game 5 of the 2005 ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. With the Yankees up 2‚Äì1, the Angels had runners on first and second with two outs when Adam Kennedy hit a pitch off Mike Mussina deep to right-center. Crosby and right-fielder Gary Sheffield collided while trying to catch the ball, allowing two runs to score to give the Angels a 3‚Äì2 lead. The Angels would go on to win the game 5‚Äì3 and continue to the ALCS. Crosby finished the season having hit .276 over 76 games. =2006= During the offseason, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman initially stated that Crosby would be the Yankees starting center fielder in 2006. Nevertheless, upon the large signing of Johnny Damon in December, he was again put in a reserve role and ceded his number 18 to Damon. Though again made the team's opening roster, he lost almost a month on the 15 Day Disabled list from mid-May to June. After having appeared in 65 games, on August 4, 2006, Crosby was designated for assignment by the Yankees. He cleared waivers on August 9, however, and reported back to the Clippers, remaining in the Yankee organization. He became a 6-year Minor League free agent after the season. Cincinnati Reds (2007) On November 10, 2006, the Cincinnati Reds signed Crosby for the 2007 season. Crosby agreed to a one-year contract that paid $400,000 while he was in the majors, and $75,000 in the minors. \\"We're getting a guy that's been on winning teams, that plays the game the right way, that always plays it hard and can play all three outfield positions,\\" Reds general manager Wayne Krivsky said. \\"We're happy to have him.\\" Reds Sign Former Yankee Crosby, MLB.com, November 10, 2006 Crosby hit .276 in 16 games in spring training with 1 homer and 7 RBI.

Gondwanatheres have been classified as a group of uncertain affinities or as members of Multituberculata, a major extinct mammalian order. The best-known representative of Ferugliotheriidae is the genus Ferugliotherium from the Late Cretaceous epoch in Argentina. A second genus, Trapalcotherium, is known from a single tooth, a first lower molariform (molar-like tooth), from a different Late Cretaceous Argentinean locality. Another genus known from a single tooth (in this case, a fourth lower premolar), Argentodites, was first described as an unrelated multituberculate, but later identified as possibly related to Ferugliotherium. Finally, a single tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371, perhaps a last upper molariform, and a recent specimen from Mexico,SVP 2015 may represent related animals. Ferugliotheriids are known from isolated, low- crowned (brachydont) teeth and possibly a fragment of a lower jaw. Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70 g (2.5 oz). The incisors are long and procumbent and contain a band of enamel on only part of the tooth. The jaw fragment contains a long tooth socket for the incisor and bears a bladelike fourth lower premolar, resembling those of multituberculates. The premolar of Argentodites is similar. Two upper premolars also resemble multituberculate teeth, but whether these premolars are referable to Ferugliotheriidae is controversial. Molariforms are rectangular and brachydont and consist of longitudinal rows of cusps, connected by transverse crests and separated by transverse furrows. Lower molariforms have two cusp rows, and the single known putative upper molariform has three. Low-crowned and bladelike teeth as seen in ferugliotheriids may have been evolutionary precursors of the high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth of the other gondwanathere family, Sudamericidae. Most ferugliotheriids come from the Late Cretaceous epoch (Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian ages, 84‚Äì66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a marshy or seashore environment. They coexisted with mammals such as dryolestoids and a variety of other animals, including dinosaurs. Ferugliotheriids may have been herbivores or omnivores. Taxonomy The first member of the family Ferugliotheriidae to be discovered, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, was named in 1986 by Argentinean paleontologist Jos√© F. Bonaparte on the basis of a tooth from the Late Cretaceous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina. Bonaparte placed Ferugliotherium as the only member of the new family Ferugliotheriidae, which he tentatively assigned to the order Multituberculata, a large group of extinct mammals (distinct from both monotremes and therians, the two major groups of living mammals) that was particularly widespread in the northern continents (Laurasia), but had never previously been found in the south (Gondwana). In 1990, Bonaparte named another species, Vucetichia gracilis, from Los Alamitos. He placed it in the family Gondwanatheriidae, together with Gondwanatherium, another Los Alamitos mammal, within the order Gondwanatheria, which also contained the family Sudamericidae, then with the single genus Sudamerica. Bonaparte considered the gondwanatheres to be probably most closely related to the xenarthrans (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) within a group called Paratheria. Also in 1990, Bonaparte merged the family Gondwanatheriidae into Sudamericidae and, together with David Krause, redefined Gondwanatheria as a multituberculate suborder that included both Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae, thus rejecting a relationship between gondwanatheres and xenarthrans. Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska redescribed Ferugliotherium in 1992 and suggested that the teeth that Vucetichia was based on may have been worn specimens of Ferugliotherium. They placed Ferugliotherium among multituberculates and suggested that it may be part of the suborder Plagiaulacoidea. The following year, Krause confirmed that Vucetichia gracilis is a synonym of Ferugliotherium windhauseni. Together with Bonaparte, he also proposed to classify gondwanatheres as a superfamily (Gondwanatherioidea) within Plagiaulacoidea, including the families Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae. In 1996, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte tentatively identified a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos as Ferugliotherium. On the basis of the morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatheres are not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria. In 1999, Rosendo Pascual and colleagues described a lower jaw of Sudamerica, which had previously only been known from isolated teeth. This jaw fragment showed that Sudamerica had four molariform teeth on each side of the lower jaws, more than any multituberculate, and consequently they removed gondwanatheres from Multituberculata and regarded their affinities as uncertain. As a consequence, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates, but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of Ferugliotherium as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these fossils as Ferugliotherium and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotheriidae) and multituberculates. In the 2000s, additional members of Ferugliotheriidae were described. In 2004, Francisco Goin and colleagues described a single enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371; their best estimate was that it represented a member of Ferugliotheriidae. On the basis of a single p4, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues named Argentodites coloniensis, from the Late Cretaceous La Colonia Formation of Argentina, in 2007 as a multituberculate, possibly referable to the suborder Cimolodonta. Gurovich and Beck argued, however, that the p4 of Argentodites did not differ materially from that in the jaw they allocated to Ferugliotherium, and that Argentodites was based on a specimen of either Ferugliotherium or a closely related animal. Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described mammals from the Allen Formation, a third Argentinean formation of similar age, in 2009, including a new ferugliotheriid, Trapalcotherium matuastensis. They also regarded Argentodites as a likely relative of Ferugliotherium and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them. Description Ferugliotheriids are known from a few dozen isolated teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described on the basis of a single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws. Unlike the very high-crowned (hypsodont) sudamericids, ferugliotheriid teeth were low- crowned (brachydont). Furthermore, sudamericid molariforms tend to be larger and are supported by one large root, but the smaller ferugliotheriids have at least two roots under their molariforms. Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70 g (2.5 oz). The incisors, known only from Ferugliotherium, are procumbent and long. Three lower and four upper incisors are known. As is usual in mammals with similarly shaped (gliriform) incisors, the lower incisors are more laterally compressed, are less curved, form a greater angle between the front side and the wear facet at the tip, and are less elliptical in shape than the uppers. The enamel band is restricted to the side that faces the lips in both the lower and upper incisors (the lower side in the lowers and the upper side in the uppers). The specimen MACN Pv-RN 975, first described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, may be a jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although it has also been identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower incisor extends all the way through the fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear. Two fossils have been interpreted as isolated lower premolars of Ferugliotherium, but neither is still regarded as such. Two other teeth have been identified as upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars. Four putative first lower molariforms (mf1s) of Ferugliotherium are known, and the only known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1. Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual row (on the side of the tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia gracilis by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details; among others, the cusps are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype. It bears two rows of two cusps. The cusps in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related. One Ferugliotherium tooth is thought to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost rectangular and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows on the side of the tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa. Range, ecology, and evolution With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium may have been an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium. Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids come from the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are approximately the same age, dating to the Campanian (84‚Äì71 mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71‚Äì66 mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations may have been an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. In each of the three formations, the mammalian fauna is dominated by the archaic group Dryolestoidea; the Los Alamitos Formation has also produced the sudamericid Gondwanatherium. Only seven mammalian teeth have been found in the Allen Formation. All three also contain remains of numerous other animals, including dinosaurs, amphibians, and fish. The Santa Rosa fossil site, where LACM 149371 was found, is in the Ucayali Region of Peru. The Santa Rosa fauna also contains fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents, a possible bat, and some notoungulates (a unique extinct group of South American ungulates). The age of this fauna is unclear, and estimates range from near the Eocene‚ÄìOligocene boundary (~35 mya) to the late Oligocene (~25 mya). The Santa Rosa mammals may have lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers. More recently, a specimen has been found in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation of Mexico, bearing several similarities to Ferugliotherium. If a ferugliotheriid, this would extend the clade's range into the Maastrichtian of North America.SVP 2015 The range of the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been recorded from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina, the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India, the Middle Eocene of Antarctica, and perhaps the Cretaceous of Tanzania (TNM 02067, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae). Nevertheless, ferugliotheriids may be the only gondwanatheres to have had a presence in the northern hemisphere.SVP 2015 References Literature cited     Gondwanatheres Cretaceous mammals Prehistoric mammal families Late Cretaceous first appearances Taxa named by Jos√© Bonaparte ","title":"Ferugliotheriidae"},{"id":"1391711","text":"Cornish wrestling (http://www.gorsedhkernow.org.uk/archivedsite/kernewek/kevren.htm Omdowl Kernewek] Gorsedh Kernow Retrieved 10 June 2010.) is a form of wrestling which has been established in Cornwall for several centuries. It is similar to the Breton Gouren wrestling style. The referee is known as a 'stickler', and it is claimed that the popular meaning of the word as a 'pedant' originates from this usage. It is colloquially known as \\"wrasslin\\" in the Cornish dialect. The wrestlers in the Cornish style both wear tough jackets enabling them to gain better grip on their opponent. All holds are taken upon the other wrestler's jacket, grabbing of the wrists or fingers is forbidden as well as any holding below the waist. Although all holds are to be taken upon the jacket, the flat of the hand is allowed to be used to push or deflect an opponent. The objective of Cornish wrestling is to throw your opponent and make him land as flat as possible on his back. Three sticklers (referees) watch and control each bout whilst also recording down the score of points achieved in play. Four pins are located on the back of a wrestler, two at the back of each shoulder and two either side just above the buttocks. If a wrestler manages to throw his opponent flat onto his back, simultaneously scoring with all four pins they score four points in that single throw and this is called a \\"Back\\" at which the bout is then finished and the throwing wrestler is the winner. The sticklers will each raise their sticks when they perceive a Back has been achieved. If two sticklers raise their sticks but one does not, a back is still awarded. The Cornish Wrestling Association was formed in 1923 to standardize the rules and to promote Cornish Wrestling throughout Cornwall and indeed Worldwide. History John Cawley throwing Chris French at Demonstration at Robby Richards Museum Opening - CWA Event 13‚Äì14 May 2006.Cornish wrestling has a long history, and Geoffrey of Monmouth suggests Historia Regum Britanniae, of c. 1139 that Corineus wrestled a Cornish giant, Gogmagog or Goemagot upon the cliff top known as Lamm Goemagot. The earliest written evidence for wrestling in the West Country comes from a 1590 poem entitled \\"Poly-Olbion\\" by Michael Drayton, concerning the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. It states that the Cornish men who accompanied Henry V into battle held a banner of two Cornish wrestlers in a hitch. Cornish, Devon and Breton wrestlers have long taken part in inter-Celtic matches since at least 1402 and these still occasionally continue. In early times Cornish and Devonian wrestlers often had matches against each other though the rules they followed were not the same. One of these was the notable match between Richard Parkyn and the Devonian Jordan. In the 17th century, historian Richard Carew wrote of Cornish wrestling... *\\"Wrastling is as full of manliness, more delightful and less dangerous (than hurling).... for you shall hardly find an assembly of boyes in Devon and Cornwall, where the most untowardly amongst them will not as readily give you a muster of this exercise as you are prone to require it.\\"Carew, Sir Richard (1602) Survey of Cornwall. Reissued: New York, 1969 Sir Thomas Parkyns (1662‚Äì1741), known as the Wrestling Baronet, was a devotee of wrestling and organised an annual wrestling match in Bunny Park (prize a gold- laced hat). These matches continued until 1810. His book on the subject The Inn-Play: or, the Cornish Hugg-Wrestler was published in 1713 and reprinted many times.Hole, Christina (1949) English Sports and Pastimes. London: Batsford; p. 31 A contest at Bodmin in 1811 attracted 4,000 spectators, but thereafter interest in the sport waned. James Gerry (of Linkinhorne) and Samuel Rundle (Plymouth) fought for a ¬£20 purse and the championship of Cornwall in 1883 at Liskeard. Lasting just over an hour, the match ended in a draw in the 19th round following Rundle tearing leg muscles. Gerry was reported in The Cornishman newspaper to have vanquished all the best men in America as well as many men in Cornwall, Rundle had beaten nearly all the wrestling men in Devon and Cornwall. The Cornish Wrestling Association was formed in 1923. In 1927 William Tregonning Hooper (Bras y Golon) agreed with the Breton Dr. Cottonac of Quimper that there should be annual wrestling tournaments in which both Cornish and Breton wrestlers would compete. In the 1970s Truro Cathedral School was teaching Cornish wrestling as part of its physical education programme and was the only school in Cornwall to do so.Peter Berresford Ellis (1974) The Cornish Language and its Literature. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, p. 199 Perhaps the most famous Cornish wrestler was the US President, statesman and soldier Theodore Roosevelt, whose training started when he was New York governor, where he was taught three times a week by Professor Mike J. Dwyer. Events since 2000 Ashley Cawley, (son of Gerry Cawley, a well-known Champion Cornish Wrestler), is the current (2005) Heavyweight Champion of Cornwall. Ashley Cawley defended his title (Heavyweight Champion of Cornwall) for the first time in 2006. The tournament was hosted at Lostwithiel on 16 July and the final of the tournament was a monumental bout between Ashley and Darrin Richardson lasting an hour long; Ashley finally beat Darrin on \\"first one to touch ground\\". The following Sunday (23 July) an Interceltic Tournament took place at Wadebridge, where a team of wrestlers from Brittany came over to Cornwall to challenge the Cornish Champions in relevant classes. Just a week on Ashley Cawley, still bearing injuries from the Heavyweight Tournament, took on his opponent from Brittany and won, becoming the Interceltic and Heavyweight Champion of 2006. Cornish Wrestling at the Royal Cornwall Show The Cornish Wrestling Association (CWA) still features annually at the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show. The Cornish wrestling tent can be found in the Countryside area very near to the west entrance. In the Cornish wrestling tent you will find an impressive display of Cornish wrestling trophies, belts, history, photos, books and DVDs. The wrestlers perform demonstrations of their style in the Countryside ring, usually twice a day for each of the three days of the show. The demonstrations feature most of the throws and moves of the Cornish style and also feature demonstration bouts usually with a variety of wrestlers from youngsters, girls, lightweights and heavyweights. Outside Cornwall Cornish wrestling is Cornwall's oldest sport and as Cornwall's native tradition it has travelled the world to places like Victoria, Australia and Grass Valley, California following the miners and gold rushes. In the city of Grass Valley, the tradition of singing Cornish carols lives on and St Piran's Day celebrations are held every year, which along with carol singing, includes a flag raising ceremony, games involving the Cornish pasty, and Cornish wrestling competitions.

It is situated on the north bank of the River Tees, and hosts the northern end of the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge. History Formerly known as Samphire Batts, it is situated on the River Tees. As the Industrial Revolution took shape and ships got bigger, access to Stockton became harder, and so colliery owners needed better access to the North Sea. 19th century Investors created the Clarence Railway which connected Stockton to the newly developed port at Samphire Batts, and also Haverton Hill, a upstream. The village was hence renamed after the port. Meanwhile, its great rival the Stockton and Darlington Railway extended to Middlesbrough, on the opposite side of the river. The S&DR; extension was completed by 1830, while the CR was completed by 1833. The opening of the railways provided the stimulus for the growth of both Middlesbrough and Port Clarence. Prior to the opening of the railway, ship access to Port Clarence was very slow and difficult, often taking as long to carry the coal to the port, as it had to sail from the port to London. However, the CR shared rail track owned by the S&DR; near to the County Durham coal mines and never made a profit due to the restrictions and fees imposed by the owners of the S&DR; and eventually the PCR was taken over by the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway, a subsidiary of the Hartlepool Docks and Railway Company, to allow quicker onward shipment via new docks at Hartlepool. 20th century The area had a strong history of immigration from Ireland, with many travellers settling in the village between 1900 and 1920 to work in the local steel and chemical industries, as well as the local Furness Shipyards. Present It is served by the Stagecoach service 1 between Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. The A1046 links the village to Stockton and Middlesbrough (via the Newport Bridge) in the west and the A178 links to Hartlepool and Middlesbrough (via the Transporter Bridge) in the east.

Cartridge overall length, or \\"COL\\", is important to safe functioning of reloads in firearms. Handloaded cartridges and commercially available cartridges for firearms are normally created with a maximum length standardized by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI). A cartridge's overall length may be shorter than the maximum standard, equal to the standard, or sometimes even longer. The maximum overall length is dictated by the need to fit into a box magazine of standard manufacture. For example, the .223 Remington cartridge, when loaded for use in the AR-15 rifle (or the military's M16 rifle), has to fit into the removable box magazine for that rifle. This dictates that the cartridge's maximum overall length be no greater than 2.260\\". However, for competition purposes during off-hand and slow fire prone match stages, the .223 Remington is loaded one cartridge at a time into the rifle's receiver. This allows for the cartridge to be longer than the standardized 2.260\\" SAAMI maximum overall length. These cartridges can be safely loaded to a length that has the ogive portion of the bullet just touching the rifle's lands. Many competitive shooters will make these cartridges 0.005\\" less than the truly maximum allowable overall length, for the sake of safety. It is desirable for these single-loaded cartridges to have as little bullet jump as possible before the bullet's ogive begins to be engraved by the rifle's lands. This minimized bullet jump increases the accuracy of the rifle, all else being equal. This practice of long-loading a cartridge must be adjusted for each individual rifle, since there are variations from rifle to rifle as to how far down the barrel the rifling begins.

She was chief executive officer of News International from 2009 to 2011, having previously served as the youngest editor of a British national newspaper at News of the World, from 2000 to 2003, and the first female editor of The Sun, from 2003 to 2009. Brooks married actor Ross Kemp in 2002. They divorced in 2009 and she married former racehorse trainer and author Charlie Brooks. Brooks was a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal, having been the editor of the News of the World from 2000 to 2003 when one of the stories which involved illegal phone hacking was carried out by the newspaper. Following a criminal trial in 2014 she was cleared of all charges by a jury at the Old Bailey, which accepted her defence: that in the circumstances she had no knowledge of the illegal acts carried out by staff at the newspaper. In September 2015, Brooks was confirmed as CEO of News UK, the renamed News International, re-establishing the working relationship with News Corp founder and chairman Rupert Murdoch. Early life In 1968, John Robert Wade with mother Deborah had their daughter Rebekah Mary Wade in Warrington, Lancashire. Brooks (her married name 2009) grew up in Daresbury, to the south of Warrington, Her parents ran a tree pruning business, her father later died age 50 in Hatton in 2002. When she was 14 she decided she wanted to be a journalist and would make tea at her local newspaper and help out generally. She attended Appleton Hall High School ‚Äì a state comprehensive school that had previously been a grammar school ‚Äì in Appleton, Warrington. A childhood friend, Louise Weir, described her as \\"more emotionally intelligent than academic\\", charming and always able to get what she wanted out of people. In Brooks's entry in Who's Who she stated that she had studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, but did not claim to have a degree, and did not later answer questions about this. In a 2003 Spectator article, Stephen Glover suggested that, since she was working at the age of 20 for the News of the World, \\"we can safely assume that she did not study at the Sorbonne in any meaningful way\\". In 2010, Brooks was awarded an honorary Fellowship from the University of the Arts, London, for her contribution to journalism. She attended the London College of Communication, now part of the university, as a student. The commentator Henry Porter claims little is known of Brooks personally. Tim Minogue, who was one of her first co-editors before becoming a journalist at Private Eye magazine, recalled a \\"likeable, skinny, hollow-eyed girl who was very ambitious\\". Career After school she worked for the French magazine L'architecture d'aujourd'hui in Paris, before returning to Britain to work for Eddy Shah's Messenger Group. Graham Ball, the then features editor at The Post newspaper, recalled that she was a notably astute and intelligent staff member. When The Post was disbanded, Brooks then moved to the News of the World. News of the World She joined the Sunday newspaper News of the World in 1989 as a secretary, before working as a feature writer for its Sunday magazine, eventually becoming the paper's deputy editor. In 1994, she prepared for the News of the Worlds interview with James Hewitt, a lover of Diana, Princess of Wales, by reserving a hotel suite and hiring a team to \\"kit it out with secret tape devices in various flowerpots and cupboards\\", Piers Morgan, her former boss, wrote in his memoir The Insider, The New York Times relayed in July 2011. In 1998, she transferred to the News of the Worlds daily counterpart, The Sun for a short time. She then returned to the News of the World in 2000 as editor; at the time, she was the youngest editor of a national British newspaper. While at the News of the World, Brooks oversaw its campaign of \\"naming and shaming\\" individuals suspected to be convicted child sex offenders‚Äîa campaign launched in the wake of the murder of Sarah Payne while hacking her mother's voicemail. The paper's decision led to angry mobs terrorising those they suspected of being child sex offenders, which included several cases of mistaken identity and one instance where a paediatrician had her house vandalised, apparently by people who thought her occupation meant she was a paedophile. The campaign was described as \\"grossly irresponsible\\" journalism by the Chief Constable of Gloucestershire, Tony Butler, but Brooks defended the paper's actions on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost, claiming that it was \\"only right that the public have controlled access\\" to information on sex offenders. The paper's already strong sales held up well under her leadership, while those of rival Sunday newspapers The People and the Sunday Mirror fell more sharply. The Sun In January 2003, she returned to The Sun, replacing her former boss David Yelland, to become its first female editor. On Brooks's first day as editor, the Page 3 girl was Rebekah Parmar-Teasdale ‚Äì the caption to the picture was \\"Rebekah from Wapping\\". Soon after becoming editor, Brooks ran the headline \\"Bonkers Bruno Locked Up\\" concerning the mental health problems of former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno. The next day The Sun ran a 600-word reply from the head of the mental health charity SANE and since then has adopted a style guide on covering mental health stories prepared by the same charity. Brooks and her husband spent a day with the head of SANE and made donations to the charity. On her appointment as editor of The Sun she said \\"It's the best job in newspapers.\\" It was said of her by David Yelland, a former editor of The Sun \\"She's good at schmoozing showbusiness people. She can turn people over and have dinner with them the next day\\". During a March 2003 appearance before the House of Commons Select committee on Culture, Media and Sport as part of an inquiry into privacy issues, Brooks stated that her newspaper had paid police for information. Alison Clark, the director of corporate affairs at News International, later stated, \\"It is not company practice to pay police for information.\\" Brooks has been chairman of the organisation Women in Journalism and has served as a judge for the \\"Guardian Student Media Awards\\" in November 2003 and the tenth annual Police Bravery Awards in July 2005, the latter sponsored by The Sun. News International In June 2009, it was announced that she would leave The Sun in September 2009, to become chief executive of the newspaper's parent company, News International. Dominic Mohan was named her successor as editor of The Sun. Brooks received ¬£10.8m for leaving News International. News UK In September 2015, Brooks was reappointed as CEO of News UK, the renamed News International. Phone hacking scandal A police enquiry revealed that the News of the World had a routine practice of intercepting mobile phone messages of celebrities, politicians and other public figures. The newspaper's reporter, Clive Goodman, and Glenn Mulcaire, a hired investigator, were convicted and jailed for intercepting the phone messages of members of the Royal Family in 2006. Questioning by MPs In 2003, under questioning by the Chris Bryant MP of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons, Brooks and Andy Coulson were asked whether either of their newspapers had ever been involved in various improper acts. Brooks replied \\"We have paid police for information in the past\\". Andy Coulson stepped in to say that payments were only made lawfully. The Sun, of which Brooks was editor, subsequently ridiculed Chris Bryant in a number of articles, starting with one about a photograph of him in his underpants from a gay dating website. Bryant has publicly alleged that his phone was hacked in 2003 by the News of the World, the paper which Brooks had been editor of until that year before being succeeded by Coulson (News International was later ordered to pay Bryant ¬£30,000 by a High Court judge in 2012 after Bryant filed a lawsuit). Brooks later claimed that in her response to Bryant's question she had merely been speaking about the widespread belief that payments had been made to police and denied having any knowledge of specific payments. According to MPs, Rebekah Brooks refused three times to attend the committee again to be questioned further, resulting in four committee members \\"considering asking the Serjeant at Arms to issue a warrant forcing Brooks to attend\\". It was claimed by Adam Price, a Plaid Cymru MP, that the committee members subsequently dropped this proposal because they were warned by the chair of the committee, John Whittingdale, that their private lives would be investigated if they did so. However, account is by Whittingdale where he stated there was a conversation \\"about the possible repercussions of issuing a warrant for Brooks but said that did not have any bearing on his decision and he did not believe News International would target committee members\\". On 11 May 2012 Brooks appeared as a witness in the Leveson Inquiry.\\"Former News of the World Editor Testifies to British Inquiry\\" (11 May 2012) CSPAN ‚Äì Includes complete video testimony Milly Dowler In 2011, The GuardianSarah Lyall \\"Anger Rises Over Hack to Missing Girl's Voice Mail\\", The New York Times, 5 July 2011 and a solicitor alleged that in 2002, when Brooks was editor, the paper had hacked the voicemail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler (later found to be murdered), to access messages left by her parents. It was later established that Brooks had been on holiday and out of the country when the story which referred to a message on the schoolgirl's phone was published and that, consequently, she did not edit the paper that day or read the article in question and, therefore, could not have known about the phone hacking. She was found not guilty of phone hacking at her trial in 2014. Resignation In July 2011, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said Brooks should \\"consider her position\\" after the Milly Dowler allegations.Adam Gabbatt, et al. \\"Miliband says Brooks must consider her position over phone hacking\\", The Guardian, 5 July 2011 Prime Minister David Cameron said that if Brooks had offered her resignation to him, he would have accepted it. Milly Dowler's parents also called for Brooks's resignation. When Brooks told News of the World staff that the newspaper was being closed down, some reportedly said that all of their jobs had been sacrificed to save hers. Andreas Whittam Smith suggested that Brooks's decision not to resign was symptomatic of \\"the self-serving, conceited thesis that 'only I, who was at the helm during the disaster, can steer us to safety. On 14 July, News Corporation's second largest shareholder, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al-Saud, called for her resignation in a BBC interview. Having previously had an offer of resignation rejected, Brooks resigned from News International on 15 July 2011. She said, \\"As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place. I have believed that the right and responsible action has been to lead us through the heat of the crisis. However my desire to remain on the bridge has made me a focal point of the debate. This is now detracting attention from all our honest endeavours to fix the problems of the past. Therefore I have given Rupert and James Murdoch my resignation. While it has been a subject of discussion, this time my resignation has been accepted\\".Rebekah Brooks resigns New Statesman, 15 July 2011 The Daily Telegraph reported that despite resigning from her position, Brooks remained on the company payroll and continued to receive her salary from News International, having been told by Rupert Murdoch to \\"travel the world on him for a year\\". =¬£10m payout= The Guardian newspaper, citing official company accounts, claims Brooks received a ¬£10.8m payoff for leaving News International. Arrests and prosecution On 17 July 2011, Brooks was arrested by police on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and on suspicion of corruption allegations.Raf Sanchez \\"Phone hacking: Rebekah Brooks arrested\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 July 2011 She was arrested by detectives working on Operation Weeting, the Metropolitan Police's phone hacking probe, and Operation Elveden, the probe examining illicit payments to police officers. Brooks's public relations agent Dave Wilson told CNN that she did not know she was going to be arrested when she arrived for a pre-arranged interview with London's Metropolitan Police Service. After 12 hours in custody, Brooks was released on bail until October 2011. On 13 March 2012, Brooks was rearrested, together with her husband, on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Ninety people have been arrested in conjunction with illegal acquisition of confidential information since police renewed investigations in 2011, many of them employees or agents of newspapers for which Brooks had responsibilities. Sixteen have been formally charged with crimes. On 15 May 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) charged Brooks and five others with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Charged along with Brooks regarding removal of documents and computers to conceal them from investigating detectives were her husband, her personal assistant, her bodyguard, her chauffeur, and the head of security at News International. These charges were made about 1 year after the Metropolitan Police Service reopened its dormant investigation into phone hacking, about 3 years after the then Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service told the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee that \\"no additional evidence has come to light,\\" five years after News International executives began claiming that phone hacking was the work of a single \\"rogue reporter\\", 10 years after The Guardian began reporting that the Met had evidence of widespread illegal acquisition of confidential information, and 13 years after the Met began accumulating \\"boxloads\\" of that evidence, including information sources for News of the World journalists, but kept it unexamined in trash bags at Scotland Yard. Brooks's trial over the phone-hacking claims began on 28 October 2013.\\"Phone-hacking case judge: British justice on trial\\" BBC News 29 October 2013, accessed 29 October 2013 On 31 October 2013 it was revealed she had had an affair lasting at least six years with Andy Coulson, another key figure in the phone-hacking scandal.Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson had affair, phone-hacking trial hears On 24 June 2014, Rebekah Brooks was cleared of all charges related to the phone hacking.  Reappointed CEO In September 2015, Brooks was reappointed as CEO of the company, now named News UK. Political connections The press have noted social ties between Brooks and various members of the Establishment. In 2008, she borrowed a retired police horse from the Metropolitan Police which she kept on her Oxfordshire farm, where it was ridden by David Cameron. In December 2010, a dinner party was attended by Cameron and James Murdoch. Brooks was once also a friend of Tony and Cherie Blair; and Gordon and Sarah Brown. Her wedding to Charlie Brooks in 2009 was attended by Gordon Brown and David Cameron. Her ex-husband Ross Kemp appeared in the Labour Party party election broadcast for the 2010 UK General Elections. Shortly before her arrest, she had an hour-long telephone conversation with Tony Blair. He offered to act as an unofficial advisor to Brooks and to Rupert and James Murdoch. Blair told Brooks that this arrangement should remain private. He offered her advice on how to deal with the phone hacking scandal. Making reference to the Hutton Inquiry, which had cleared his government of wrongdoing related to the death of a biological warfare expert, Blair advised Brooks to set up an internal inquiry which would clear her of wrongdoing in the phone hacking scandal. Personal life Brooks became engaged to actor Ross Kemp (best known for portraying the character Grant Mitchell in EastEnders) in 1996, and married him in June 2002 in Las Vegas. On 3 November 2005, it was reported that Brooks had been arrested following an alleged assault on her husband. She was released without charge, and the police took no further action. The Sun had been running a campaign against domestic violence at the time. The couple had spent the previous evening in the company of the former Cabinet Minister David Blunkett, who had resigned for the second time on that day. At her trial in 2013, it was revealed that Brooks and her colleague Andy Coulson had an affair between mid-1998 to around 2007, during her marriage to Kemp.Murdoch editors Brooks, Coulson had affair, British hacking trial told Private Eye and The Independent reported the couple had separated; this was not widely reported in the remainder of the British press. The 7 March 2008 issue of Private Eye refers to her \\"paramour\\", former racehorse trainer and author Charlie Brooks. The Guardian reported on 5 June 2009 that she was to marry Brooks. The Independent reported Brooks and her fianc√© had married in a lakeside ceremony in June 2009. The couple are key members of the so-called Chipping Norton set, which includes Jeremy Clarkson, David Cameron, and others. They live in Churchill, Oxfordshire, and London. It was announced by Bell Pottinger that Rebekah and Charlie Brooks were expecting a daughter in early 2012 via a surrogate mother.Vanity Fair, \\"Untangling Rebekah Brooks\\", Suzanna Andrews, February 2012, No. 618 A daughter was born at the private Portland Hospital in London on 25 January 2012.

Roughly half of that town is contained in Crawford Notch State Park. The high point of the notch, at approximately above sea level, is at the southern end of the town of Carroll, near the Crawford Depot train station and Saco Lake, the source of the Saco River, which flows southward through the steep-sided notch. North of the high point of the notch, Crawford Brook flows more gently northwest to the Ammonoosuc River, a tributary of the Connecticut River. The notch is traversed by U.S. Route 302, which closely follows the Saco River southeast to North Conway and less closely follows the Ammonoosuc River northwest to Littleton. History Originally called White Mountain Notch, it became known to European settlers when found by Timothy Nash in 1771. The 1772 boundaries of Hart's Grant reflected its shape. It was named for the Crawford family, who were trail-builders and hostelers there in the 19th century. The Tenth New Hampshire Turnpike from Portsmouth was extended through the notch to Lancaster in 1803.* The turnpike and later Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad through Crawford Notch opened a new route through the White Mountains for settlers of the area to the northwest to reach Conway on the way to the trading ports on the coast.Johnson, Ron Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division p.9 Thomas Hill (1829‚Äì1908), looking north, collection of the New Hampshire Historical Society A well-documented historic event within the notch was a rockslide that killed the entire Samuel Willey family in August 1826. The family fled their home during the storm to a prepared shelter but were buried by the slide and died in a mass of stone and rubble. Their home was untouched. Mount Willey, on the west side of the notch, is named in their memory. The event in part inspired a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne titled The Ambitious Guest.

James. It is noted for its harsh, abrasive sound. James recorded numerous versions of the piece under his Aphex Twin alias. The piece is named after a trade name for the drug Salbutamol, which is prescribed for the treatment of asthma. A reported side effect of this drug is tinnitus, a high pitched ringing in the ears. James utilised this effect in \\"Ventolin\\", incorporating a piercing high- pitched ringing sound throughout the track. The music also incorporates heavily distorted techno beats. The resulting effect has been cited as \\"one of the harshest singles ever recorded\\". The song is sampled by the Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly in the song \\"Retribution\\" on their 1999 album Implode. Album/video version The first recording of \\"Ventolin\\" (the \\"video version\\") appeared on a music video produced to accompany the track. The video consists of a woman being trapped in an elevator with other industrial images interspersed. The \\"video version\\" of the track was released a month later on the 1995 Aphex Twin album ...I Care Because You Do. Single releases In 1995, Warp Records released \\"Ventolin\\" as a single in the United Kingdom, on 12-inch vinyl and CD in two parts, Ventolin and Ventolin Remixes. Between them, these EPs have a further 12 versions of \\"Ventolin\\". (The United States release, by Sire Records, collects all of the tracks on a single CD.) Designed by Dan Parkes (who also designed the artwork for On), the single's artwork has Renaissance-style anatomical drawings of a human head and upper torso, together with an asthma inhaler and the Aphex Twin logo. Notes on the various \\"remixes\\" Whilst all twelve versions of \\"Ventolin\\" on these singles are labelled as ostensible remixes, in many cases they appear to be almost entirely new pieces of music, bearing only nominal relation to the original. The \\"Wheeze\\" mix is the only remix that utilises the high-pitched ringing and sounds from the original \\"Ventolin\\". *The \\"Salbutamol Mix\\" is an extended version of the \\"video version\\". *Several of the apparently bizarre remix names are actually Cornish place names: Praze-An-Beeble, Marazanvose,Map Carharrack and Probus are all Cornish villages. There is a Coppice Inn in the village of Lanner, near Redruth. Plain-An-Gwarry is an area within Redruth and also the generic name for a Cornish medieval amphitheatre used for the performance of mystery plays and sports. *Other mix names refer to the medicinal Ventolin: \\"asthma beats\\", \\"wheeze\\" (a symptom of asthma) and Salbutamol. *The \\"Praze-An- Beeble mix\\" ends with manipulated samples of James' mother Lorna laughing, whilst the \\"Marazanvose mix\\" ends with a child counting in Afrikaans mixed with manipulated animal sounds. *\\"Crowsmengegus mix\\" closes with a speech synthesizer (MacinTalk \\"Whisper\\") intoning an MC's toast to a list of names (\\"Respect going out to...\\"), almost all of whom were collaborators with James.

Structure and appointment The Saskatchewan Order of Merit is intended to honour any Canadian citizen currently or formerly resident in Saskatchewan who has demonstrated a high level of individual excellence and achievement in any field, improving the \\"social, cultural and economic well-being of the province and its residents\\"; the process of finding such individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council. There are no limitations on population, but only ten new members may be created each year. The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor. Posthumous nominations are accepted within one year of the date of death and in 2001 the Provincial Emblems and Honours Act was amended to allow for honorary membership in the order, granted to those who are neither current nor former residents of Saskatchewan; Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, was the first honorary member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, having been appointed on 24 April 2001. The lieutenant governor, who is ex officio a member and the Chancellor of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and remains a member following his or her departure from viceregal office, then makes all appointments into the fellowship's single grade of membership by letters patent bearing the viceroyal sign-manual and the Great Seal of the province; thereafter, the new Members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters SOM and have their portrait added to the Athabasca Gallery at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. Insignia Upon admission into the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, members are presented with the order's insignia at a ceremony held either at Government House in Regina or at a venue in Saskatoon. According to The Provincial Emblems and Honours Act, which stipulates the design of the order's badges and ribbon and how they are worn, the main emblem of the order is a silver medallion in the form of a six pointed star‚Äîan abstract rendition of a western red lilly, the province's official flower. The obverse is coated in white enamel and bears the escutcheon of Her Majesty's Arms in right of Saskatchewan within a circular ribbon that displays the provincial motto‚ÄîMultis E Gentibus Vires (From many peoples strength)‚Äîall topped by a St. Edward's Crown symbolizing the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour. This medallion is hung from a ribbon with a green-gold-green, vertical striped pattern, at the collar for men, and on a bow pinned at the left chest for women. Members will also receive for wear on casual clothing a lapel pin in the form of a stylized western red lily bearing at St. Edward's Crown.

Both species are known from fossils found in China that date to the early Cretaceous period, about 125-123.2 million years ago. R. robustus is one of several Mesozoic mammals for which there is good evidence that it fed on vertebrates, including dinosaurs, though it is not possible to determine if it actively hunted live dinosaurs or scavenged dead ones. R. giganticus is among the largest mammals known from the Mesozoic era.  Classification and discovery  An R. robustus feeding on a Psittacosaurus hatchling. The fossils were recovered from the lagerst√§tte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning province of China, which is renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been specifically dated to 125‚Äì123.2 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous period. Repenomamus is a genus of triconodonts, a group of early mammals with no modern relatives. R. robustus was described by Li, Wang, Wang and Li in 2000, and R. giganticus was described by Hu, Meng, Wang and Li in 2005. The two known species are the sole members of the family Repenomamidae, which was also described in the same paper in 2000. It is sometimes alternatively listed as a member of the family Gobiconodontidae; although this assignment is controversial, a close relationship to this family is well-founded. Description Fossil skull of R. giganticus Individuals of the known species in Repenomamus are the largest known Mesozoic mammals represented by reasonably complete fossils (though Kollikodon may be larger,Clemens et al., 2003 and Schowalteria, Oxlestes, Khuduklestes and Bubodens reached similar if not larger sizes), adults of R. robustus were the size of a Virginia opossum with an estimated mass of while the known adult of R. giganticus was about 50% larger with a total length of around and an estimated mass of . These finds extend considerably the known body size range of Mesozoic mammals. In fact, Repenomamus was larger than several small sympatric dromaeosaurid dinosaurs like Graciliraptor. Features of its shoulder and legs bones indicate a sprawling posture as in most of small to medium sized living therian mammals, with plantigrade feet. Unlike therian mammals, Repenomamus had proportionally longer bodies with shorter limbs. The dental formula was originally interpreted as , though a more recent study indicates instead that it was .Alexey Lopatin, Alexander Averianov, Gobiconodon (Mammalia) from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia and Revision of Gobiconodontidae, First online: 12 July 2014 Paleobiology The R. robustus specimen with Psittacosaurus remains in its stomach, Paleozoological Museum of China Features of the teeth and jaw suggest that Repenomamus were carnivorous and a specimen of R. robustus discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile Psittacosaurus preserved in its stomach represents the second direct evidence that at least some Mesozoic mammals were carnivorous and fed on other vertebrates, including dinosaurs; a recorded attack on an Archaeornithoides by a Deltatheridium predates its description. Speciations towards carnivory are known in eutriconodonts as a whole, and similarly large sized species like Gobiconodon, Jugulator and even Triconodon itself are thought to have tackled proportionally large prey as well; evidence of scavenging is even assigned to the former. Like most other non-therian mammals, Repenomamus had an epipubic bone, meaning that it gave birth to or laid eggs that hatched into undeveloped young like modern marsupials and monotremes.

In this example, it takes light 1.26 seconds to travel from the Earth to the Moon. Due to the vast distances involved, much longer delays may be incurred than in the Earth-bound Internet. The interplanetary Internet is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes that can communicate with each other.The Interplanetary Internet, Joab Jackson, IEEE Spectrum, August 2005. Interplanetary communication is greatly delayed by interplanetary distances, so a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and errors are required. The interplanetary Internet is a store and forward network of internets that is often disconnected, has a wireless backbone fraught with error-prone links and delays ranging from tens of minutes to even hours, even when there is a connection.The Interplanetary Internet: A Communications Infrastructure for Mars Exploration ‚Äì 53rd International Astronautical Congress. The World Space Congress, 19 Oct 2002/Houston, Texas Development Space communication technology has steadily evolved from expensive, one-of-a-kind point-to-point architectures, to the re-use of technology on successive missions, to the development of standard protocols agreed upon by space agencies of many countries. This last phase has gone on since 1982 through the efforts of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), a body composed of the major space agencies of the world. It has 11 member agencies, 28 observer agencies, and over 140 industrial associates. The evolution of space data system standards has gone on in parallel with the evolution of the Internet, with conceptual cross-pollination where fruitful, but largely as a separate evolution. Since the late 1990s, familiar Internet protocols and CCSDS space link protocols have integrated and converged in several ways; for example, the successful FTP file transfer to Earth-orbiting STRV 1B on January 2, 1996, which ran FTP over the CCSDS IPv4-like Space Communications Protocol Specifications (SCPS) protocols.The Space Technology Research Vehicles: STRV-1a, b, c and d, Richard Blott and Nigel Wells, AIAA Small Satellite Conference, Logan, Utah, 1996.Appendix F, CCSDS 710.0-G-0.3: Space Communication Protocol Specification (SCPS) - Rationale, Requirements, and Application Notes, Draft Green Book, Issue 0.3. April 1997. Internet Protocol use without CCSDS has taken place on spacecraft, e.g., demonstrations on the UoSAT-12 satellite, and operationally on the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. Having reached the era where networking and IP on board spacecraft have been shown to be feasible and reliable, a forward- looking study of the bigger picture was the next phase. ICANN meeting, Los Angeles, USA, 2007. The marquee pays a humorous homage to the Ed Wood film Plan 9 from Outer Space, and the operating system Plan 9 from Bell Labs, while namedropping Internet pioneer Vint Cerf using a spoof of a then-current film Surf's Up. The Interplanetary Internet study at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was started by a team of scientists at JPL led by Vinton Cerf and the late Adrian Hooke.CCSDS.org -- CCSDS Hall of Fame -- Adrian Hooke Cerf is one of the pioneers of the Internet on Earth, and currently holds the position of distinguished visiting scientist at JPL. Hooke was one of the founders and directors of CCSDS. While IP-like SCPS protocols are feasible for short hops, such as ground station to orbiter, rover to lander, lander to orbiter, probe to flyby, and so on, delay-tolerant networking is needed to get information from one region of the Solar System to another. It becomes apparent that the concept of a region is a natural architectural factoring of the Interplanetary Internet. A region is an area where the characteristics of communication are the same. Region characteristics include communications, security, the maintenance of resources, perhaps ownership, and other factors. The Interplanetary Internet is a \\"network of regional internets\\". What is needed then, is a standard way to achieve end-to-end communication through multiple regions in a disconnected, variable-delay environment using a generalized suite of protocols. Examples of regions might include the terrestrial Internet as a region, a region on the surface of the Moon or Mars, or a ground-to-orbit region. The recognition of this requirement led to the concept of a \\"bundle\\" as a high-level way to address the generalized Store- and-Forward problem. Bundles are an area of new protocol development in the upper layers of the OSI model, above the Transport Layer with the goal of addressing the issue of bundling store-and-forward information so that it can reliably traverse radically dissimilar environments constituting a \\"network of regional internets\\". Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) was designed to enable standardized communications over long distances and through time delays. At its core is something called the Bundle Protocol (BP), which is similar to the Internet Protocol, or IP, that serves as the heart of the Internet here on Earth. The big difference between the regular Internet Protocol (IP) and the Bundle Protocol is that IP assumes a seamless end-to-end data path, while BP is built to account for errors and disconnections ‚Äî glitches that commonly plague deep-space communications. Bundle Service Layering, implemented as the Bundling protocol suite for delay-tolerant networking, will provide general- purpose delay-tolerant protocol services in support of a range of applications: custody transfer, segmentation and reassembly, end-to-end reliability, end-to-end security, and end-to-end routing among them. The Bundle Protocol was first tested in space on the UK-DMC satellite in 2008.Use of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol from Space , L.Wood et al., Conference paper IAC-08-B2.3.10, 59th International Astronautical Congress, Glasgow, September 2008.UK-DMC satellite first to transfer sensor data from space using 'bundle' protocol, press release, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, 11 September 2008. Deep Impact mission An example of one of these end-to-end applications flown on a space mission is the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP), used on the comet mission, Deep Impact. CFDP is an international standard for automatic, reliable file transfer in both directions. CFDP should not be confused with Coherent File Distribution Protocol, which has the same acronym and is an IETF-documented experimental protocol for rapidly deploying files to multiple targets in a highly networked environment. In addition to reliably copying a file from one entity (such as a spacecraft or ground station) to another entity, CFDP has the capability to reliably transmit arbitrary small messages defined by the user, in the metadata accompanying the file, and to reliably transmit commands relating to file system management that are to be executed automatically on the remote end-point entity (such as a spacecraft) upon successful reception of a file. Protocol The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet telemetry standard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft instrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or other data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more packets.  CCSDS packet definition  A packet is a block of data with length that can vary between successive packets, ranging from 7 to 65,542 bytes, including the packet header. * Packetized data is transmitted via frames, which are fixed-length data blocks. The size of a frame, including frame header and control information, can range up to 2048 bytes. * Packet sizes are fixed during the development phase. Because packet lengths are variable but frame lengths are fixed, packet boundaries usually do not coincide with frame boundaries.  Telecom processing notes  Data in a frame is typically protected from channel errors by error-correcting codes. * Even when the channel errors exceed the correction capability of the error- correcting code, the presence of errors is nearly always detected by the error-correcting code or by a separate error-detecting code. * Frames for which uncorrectable errors are detected are marked as undecodable and typically are deleted.  Handling data loss  Deleted undecodable whole frames are the principal type of data loss that affects compressed data sets. In general, there would be little to gain from attempting to use compressed data from a frame marked as undecodable. * When errors are present in a frame, the bits of the subband pixels are already decoded before the first bit error will remain intact, but all subsequent decoded bits in the segment usually will be completely corrupted; a single bit error is often just as disruptive as many bit errors. * Furthermore, compressed data usually are protected by powerful, long-blocklength error-correcting codes, which are the types of codes most likely to yield substantial fractions of bit errors throughout those frames that are undecodable. Thus, frames with detected errors would be essentially unusable even if they were not deleted by the frame processor. This data loss can be compensated for with the following mechanisms. * If an erroneous frame escapes detection, the decompressor will blindly use the frame data as if they were reliable, whereas in the case of detected erroneous frames, the decompressor can base its reconstruction on incomplete, but not misleading, data. * However, it is extremely rare for an erroneous frame to go undetected. * For frames coded by the CCSDS Reed‚ÄìSolomon code, fewer than 1 in 40,000 erroneous frames can escape detection. * All frames not employing the Reed‚ÄìSolomon code use a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error-detecting code, which has an undetected frame-error rate of less than 1 in 32,000. Implementation The InterPlanetary Internet Special Interest Group of the Internet Society has worked on defining protocols and standards that would make the IPN possible. The Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) is the primary group researching Delay-tolerant networking (DTN). Additional research efforts focus on various uses of the new technology. The canceled Mars Telecommunications Orbiter had been planned to establish an Interplanetary Internet link between Earth and Mars, in order to support other Mars missions. Rather than using RF, it would have used optical communications using laser beams for their higher data rates. \\"Lasercom sends information using beams of light and optical elements, such as telescopes and optical amplifiers, rather than RF signals, amplifiers, and antennas\\" NASA JPL continued to test the DTN protocol with their Deep Impact Networking (DINET) experiment on board the Deep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft in October, 2008.NASA Successfully Tests First Deep Space Internet NASA Press Release 08-298, November 2008. In May 2009, DTN was deployed to a payload on board the ISS. NASA and BioServe Space Technologies, a research group at the University of Colorado, have been continuously testing DTN on two Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payloads. CGBA-4 and CGBA-5 serve as computational and communications platforms which are remotely controlled from BioServe's Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) in Boulder, CO.

These initial experiments provide insight into future missions where DTN will enable the extension of networks into deep space to explore other planets and solar system points of interest. Seen as necessary for space exploration, DTN enables timeliness of data return from operating assets which results in reduced risk and cost, increased crew safety, and improved operational awareness and science return for NASA and additional space agencies.NASA: Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) - Experiment/Payload Overview. September 24, 2010. Retrieved October 2010. DTN has several major arenas of application, in addition to the Interplanetary Internet, which include sensor networks, military and tactical communications, disaster recovery, hostile environments, mobile devices and remote outposts.Home - Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group As an example of a remote outpost, imagine an isolated Arctic village, or a faraway island, with electricity, one or more computers, but no communication connectivity. With the addition of a simple wireless hotspot in the village, plus DTN-enabled devices on, say, dog sleds or fishing boats, a resident would be able to check their e-mail or click on a Wikipedia article, and have their requests forwarded to the nearest networked location on the sled's or boat's next visit, and get the replies on its return. Earth orbit Earth orbit is sufficiently nearby that conventional protocols can be used. For example, the International Space Station has been connected to the regular terrestrial Internet since January 22, 2010 when the first unassisted tweet was posted. However, the space station also serves as a useful platform to develop, experiment, and implement systems that make up the interplanetary Internet. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have used an experimental version of the interplanetary Internet to control an educational rover, placed at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, from the International Space Station. The experiment used the DTN protocol to demonstrate technology that one day could enable Internet-like communications that can support habitats or infrastructure on another planet.Kraft, Rachel (2012-11-08).

An earlier group of witnesses who said they had seen the plates were called the Three Witnesses. Testimony The Testimony of Eight Witnesses was first published at the end of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon and has been printed in nearly every edition since, although most subsequent editions moved the statement to the front of the book and included minor grammatical corrections. > Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this > work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jr., the translatorIn the first edition > of the Book of Mormon, \\"Author and Proprietor\\" appeared in place of > \\"translator\\". of this work, has shewn unto us the plates of which hath been > spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the > said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the > engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of > curious workmanship.

Photograph of the > signatures of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon Christian Whitmer > Jacob Whitmer Peter Whitmer, Jr. John Whitmer Hiram Page Joseph Smith, Sen. > Hyrum Smith Samuel H. Smith Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified that they were shown the plates by Joseph Smith rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses.According to Terryl Givens, Joseph invited the Eight \\"to a family prayer spot in the woods\\" and \\"matter-of-factly displayed to them the golden plates,\\" whereas the Three were shown the plates \\"by an angel of God [who] came down from heaven.\\" Terryl Givens, By the Hand of Mormon (Oxford University Press, 2002), 40. Setting Toward the end of June 1829, at the Peter Whitmer Sr. home in Fayette, New York, Joseph Smith (with Oliver Cowdery as scribe) finished the translation of the Book of Mormon. Near the end of translation process, a prophecy was translated from the Second Book of Nephi that three, and \\"a few\\" others, might see the golden plates. Subsequently, on June 28, 1829, near the Whitmer farm, the Three Witnesses had their experience. Thereafter, the Smith and Whitmer families traveled to the Joseph Smith, Sr. home in Palmyra, New York. On July 2, 1829, near the Smith home, the Eight Witnesses allegedly saw and handled the golden plates. About the witnesses The Eight Witnesses were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith Sr., Hyrum Smith, and Samuel H. Smith. Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph Smith's father, and Hyrum and Samuel were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.Richard Lyman Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005) p. 79: \\"Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive .... The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph‚Äîand God‚Äîanswering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians.\\" Noting the familiar relationship among the witnesses, satirist Mark Twain wrote, \\"I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified.\\" Split with Smith In 1838, the living members of Whitmer family (Christian Whitmer and Peter Whitmer Jr. died in 1835 and 1836, respectively) became estranged from Smith during a leadership struggle in Far West, Missouri, and all were excommunicated along with other dissenters and fled Caldwell County after receiving an ultimatum from the Danites.Bushman, 337, 339, 350‚Äì51. On June 17, Sidney Rigdon \\"preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot .... Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably Danites by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders .... Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled.\\" (355‚Äì51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed Church of Christ founded by William E. McLellin. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should \\"write and keep a regular history\\" of the church. Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995). Following the death of Smith, none of the Whitmers joined the group that was led by Brigham Young and would become The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yet despite the estrangement of the Whitmer family, there is little evidence that any of the Eight Witnesses denied his testimony to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon or the gold plates.; . One third-hand source, the former Mormon leader Stephen Burnett, said in 1838 that Martin Harris had told him that \\"the eight witnesses never saw [the plates] & hesitated to sign that instrument for that reason, but were persuaded to do it.\\" Stephen Burnett letter to Lyman E.

Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Built by the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Tacony ‚Äì the first ship to be so named by the U.S. Navy ‚Äì was launched on 7 May 1863; sponsored by Miss Ellie M. Wells, daughter of Lieutenant Commander Clark H. Wells, the captain of the yard at Philadelphia; and commissioned there on 12 February 1864, Lt. Comdr. William T. Truxtun in command.  Civil War operations   Assigned to the East Gulf blockade  The double-ender was assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron and sailed south from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania soon thereafter, bound for Key West, Florida. She reached Newport News, Virginia, on the 15th and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs to her steering machinery. While the steamer was undergoing this yard work, a dispatch arrived reassigning her to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.  Reassigned to the North Atlantic blockade  She departed Hampton Roads before dawn on the morning of 27 February, bound for the North Carolina sounds to strengthen Union forces afloat in those dangerous waters against the attacks by the Confederate ironclad ram Albemarle, then reportedly nearing completion up the Roanoke River. But for a brief run‚Äîvia Norfolk, Virginia ‚Äì to Washington, D.C. for repair, she served in the sounds until after the destruction of Albemarle on the night of 27 and 28 October. On 31 October 1864, the ship participated in the capture of Plymouth, North Carolina. Four sailors from the Tacony were awarded the Medal of Honor for going ashore and disabling a Confederate artillery gun while under heavy fire during this action. The men were Landsman Henry Brutsche, Landsman Robert Graham, Landsman Michael C. Horgan, and Quarter Gunner James Tallentine.  Supporting the attack on Fort Fisher  In December, Tacony left the sounds to join the force Rear Admiral David D. Porter was assembling to destroy the defenses of Wilmington, North Carolina; and she participated in the abortive attack against Fort Fisher on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. She was part of the powerful fleet which Porter led back to Fort Fisher in mid-January 1865, and she supported the effort which finally compelled that valuable Confederate stronghold to surrender on the 15th. She also participated in the attack against Fort Anderson late in the month. The ship continued blockade duty through the collapse of the Confederacy and then sailed north.  Post-war service and decommissioning  U.S.S. TACONY She was decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts on 21 June 1865 for repairs and Recommissioned on 16 September 1865 and stationed at Vera Cruz, Mexico, to observe the events surrounding the abdication and execution of Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico on 19 June 1867. She was decommissioned for the final time at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Tacony remained in ordinary until 26 August 1868 when she was sold. No trace of her subsequent career has been found.The Fall of Maximilian's Empire: As Seen from a United States Gun-boat  See also  *List of United States Navy ships  References  *  External links  * USS Tacony Ships of the Union Navy Ships built in Philadelphia Steamships of the United States Navy Sassacus-class gunboats American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States 1863 ships ","title":"USS Tacony (1863)"},{"id":"1391836","text":"Sundiata Acoli (born January 14, 1937,\\"Who is Sundiata Acoli?\\" SundiataAcoli.org. as Clark Edward Squire) is a former member of the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army.

Approximately 10x micrograph of a doubled die on a coin, where the date was struck twice. A micrograph or photomicrograph is a photograph or digital image taken through a microscope or similar device to show a magnified image of an object. This is opposed to a macrograph or photomacrograph, an image which is also taken on a microscope but is only slightly magnified, usually less than 10 times. Micrography is the practice or art of using microscopes to make photographs. A micrograph contains extensive details of microstructure. A wealth of information can be obtained from a simple micrograph like behavior of the material under different conditions, the phases found in the system, failure analysis, grain size estimation, elemental analysis and so on. Micrographs are widely used in all fields of microscopy. Types Photomicrograph A light micrograph or photomicrograph is a micrograph prepared using an optical microscope, a process referred to as photomicroscopy. At a basic level, photomicroscopy may be performed simply by connecting a camera to a microscope, thereby enabling the user to take photographs at reasonably high magnification. Scientific use began in England in 1850 by Prof Richard Hill Norris FRSE for his studies of blood cells. Roman Vishniac was a pioneer in the field of photomicroscopy, specializing in the photography of living creatures in full motion. He also made major developments in light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy. Photomicrographs may also be obtained using a USB microscope attached directly to a home computer or laptop. Electron micrograph An electron micrograph is a micrograph prepared using an electron microscope. Magnification and micron bars Micrographs usually have micron bars, or magnification ratios, or both. Magnification is a ratio between the size of an object on a picture and its real size. Unfortunately, magnification can be a misleading parameter as it depends on the final size of a printed picture and therefore varies with picture size. A scale bar, or micron bar, is a line of known length displayed on a picture. The bar can be used for measurements on a picture. When the picture is resized the bar is also resized making it possible to recalculate the magnification. Ideally, all pictures destined for publication/presentation should be supplied with a scale bar; the magnification ratio is optional. All but one (limestone) of the micrographs presented on this page do not have a micron bar; supplied magnification ratios are likely incorrect, as they were not calculated for pictures at the present size. Micrography as art The microscope has been mainly used for scientific discovery. It has also been linked to the arts since its invention in the 17th century. Early adopters of the microscope, such as Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, were excellent illustrators. Cornelius Varley's graphic microscope made sketching from a microscope easier with a camera-lucida-like mechanism. After the invention of photography in the 1820s the microscope was later combined with the camera to take pictures instead of relying on an artistic rendering. Since the early 1970s individuals have been using the microscope as an artistic instrument. Websites and traveling art exhibits such as the Nikon Small World and Olympus Bioscapes have featured a range of images for the sole purpose of artistic enjoyment. Some collaborative groups, such as the Paper Project have also incorporated microscopic imagery into tactile art pieces as well as 3D immersive rooms and dance performances.

Sanchez photographed mineral and gemstone interiors in works referred to as \\"otherworldly.\\" Gallery Image:Colpoda400xm2.jpgMeasurements of a large Colpodium at 400x.

The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth equipped with two longitudinal rows of cusps. Allotheria includes Multituberculata, Gondwanatheria (which may be part of Multituberculata, as the sister group to Cimolodonta), and probably Haramiyida, although some studies show them to be more basal mammaliaforms rather than true mammals, therefore differing from true allotheres significantly. Allotheres also had a narrow pelvis, indicating that they gave birth to tiny helpless young like marsupials or laid eggs and gave milk to feed their young like monotremes do. This is a feature of all non-placental mammals. Interpretations When he first identified Allotheria in 1880, Othniel Marsh regarded this group as an order within Marsupialia. However, in 1997 McKenna and Bell classified Allotheria as an infraclass.  References  Further reading Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L.

The first Lancaster was laid down by the Philadelphia Navy Yard in December 1857; launched 20 October 1858; sponsored by Miss Harriet Lane, niece and official hostess of President James Buchanan; and commissioned 12 May 1859, Captain John Rudd in command. Service history 1859‚Äì1867 Lancaster before 1866 The new screw sloop-of-war departed Delaware Bay on 27 July 1859 for the Pacific, with Jordan Collins at the helm. After rounding Cape Horn she reached Panama Bay on 6 December. Two days later, Flag Officer John B. Montgomery hoisted his flag above Lancaster, and she served as flagship of the Pacific Squadron until 1866, cruising along the coast of South and Central America, Mexico, and California to protect American commerce and the Pacific mail steamers. On 23 February, Rear Admiral Charles H. Bell reported an incident which typified her service during the Civil War: \\"Such is the present state of affairs at Acapulco, that it is believed by both native and foreign populations that the presence of man-of-war alone prevented an attempt to sack and destroy the town by the Indians in the interior, encouraged by governor, General Alvarez ...\\" Far from the main theaters of the Civil War, a U.S. naval vessel was carrying out the traditional mission of protecting U.S. interests and keeping the peace. On 11 November 1864, a secret expedition of boats from the ship captured a party of Confederate officers aboard the passenger steamer Salvador, off the Bay of Panama. They had planned to seize the Salvador for the Confederate Government and convert her into a raider to capture Union gold shipments from California. In the spring of 1866, Lancaster received extensive repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard and on 27 June sailed from San Francisco, California for the east coast, via Panama Bay, Callao, Valpara√≠so, Barbados, and Nassau. She arrived Norfolk Navy Yard on 8 March 1867 and decommissioned on the 19th. 1869‚Äì1889 A cannon from Lancaster that stood in West Park in Stamford, Connecticut from Memorial Day, 1901 until 1942, when it was hauled away as scrap metal during World War II.

Retrieved from Google Books on March 8, 2008 Recommissioned on 26 August 1869, Lancaster sailed for the South Atlantic via Funchal, Madeira. Under the command of William B. Cushing, she arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 6 January 1870 and served as flagship of the squadron until 1875. From January to May 1874, she took part in fleet drills in the North Atlantic and was in the force concentrated at Key West lest war with Spain break out over the \\"Virginius affair\\". Spanish officials at Santiago de Cuba had seized American filibustering steamer Virginius and executed a part of her crew. After diplomatic efforts resolved the controversy peacefully, Lancaster returned to the South Atlantic until she departed Rio de Janeiro on 21 May 1875 for home, arriving at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 12 July. The ship decommissioned 31 July 1875, and laid up for repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. At this time a figurehead of an eagle carved by John Haley Bellamy was installed.Smith (1982), p. 31.Sessions (2005), p. 69. The figurehead is now on display at The Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.The Mariners' Museum (1950), p. 105. Lancaster recommissioned on 26 August 1881 and on 12 September sailed from Portsmouth for Europe. Arrived at Gibraltar November 9, she became flagship of the European Squadron and during the following years cruised extensively in the Mediterranean, northern European waters, and on the coast of Africa, protecting American citizens and commerce and promoting friendly relations with other countries. From 27 June ‚Äì 20 July 1882 the flagship was at Alexandria, Egypt, during a series of riots and was present when the British fleet bombarded the forts July 11. Rear Admiral James W. Nicholson, commanding the U.S. squadron, welcomed on board both American and foreign refugees for protection, and landed a force of 100 men to guard the American consulate and assist in extinguishing fires, in burying the dead, and in preserving order. Rear Adm. Charles Henry Baldwin relieved Rear Admiral Nicholson of command of the squadron 10 March 1883. Acting under instructions from the Navy Department, Admiral Baldwin proceeded in Lancaster to Kronstadt, Russia, and on 27 May he and his staff attended the coronation of Tsar Alexander III at Moscow. On 20 November 1883, while Lancaster was in port in Marseille, France, a young Frenchman who was on a stone pier astern of the ship fell overboard, and disappeared below the water twice. John F. Auer, a sailor on the Lancaster, saw him and, realizing that the boy could not swim, jumped into the water together with Boatswain's Mate Matthew Gillick, and rescued the boy. For this act, both Auer and Gillick were awarded the United States' highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, on 2 February 1884. Early in 1885 Lancaster cruised down the west coast of Africa and arrived in the Congo River April 28 en route to Brazil. She arrived at Rio de Janeiro 1 July and served as flagship of the squadron until 1888, cruising along the coasts of South America and Africa conducting squadron drills and exercises. Lancaster sailed 18 January 1888 from Montevideo for Europe arriving Gibraltar on 6 April. As flagship of the European Squadron she cruised in the Mediterranean until she departed Gibraltar 2 July 1889 and returned to the United States via Funchal, Madeira, arriving at New York 8 August. She decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard 7 September 1889 and was towed to the Portsmouth yard for repairs. 1891‚Äì1897 Recommissioned 19 March 1891, Lancaster proceeded to New York where Rear Adm. David B. Harmony broke his flag in her on 23 June. She departed New York 13 July en route to the Far East via Madeira, Cape Town, and Singapore. She arrived at Hong Kong 4 January 1892 and served as flagship of the Asiatic Squadron until 1894, cruising extensively on the coast of China and in Japanese waters. It was during this time Fred J. Buenzle had served aboard the Lancaster, as noted in Bluejacket; An Autobiography, a part of the Classics Of Naval Literature series. She sailed from Hong Kong 15 February 1894 for the United States, via the Suez Canal, and arrived at New York 8 June. The ship decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 30 June 1894. Lancaster recommissioned 12 September 1895 and was ordered to the South Atlantic Squadron. On 22 October, she proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, and on 4 November stood out for the South Atlantic, via Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. The ship arrived at Montevideo, Uruguay, 13 February 1896. She operated on the coast of South America until the following year, based at Montevideo, and serving part-time as flagship of the squadron. On 5 September 1897 she sailed from base for the United States, arrived Boston 18 November, and decommissioned there 31 December 1897. 1898‚Äì1915 eagle figurehead, now at the Mariners' Museum. After the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Lancaster recommissioned 5 May 1898, sailed on the 19th, and arrived on the 31st at Key West, Florida, where she served as station ship during the conflict. Departing Key West 18 August, the ship arrived at Portsmouth 3 September. Assigned to duty as a gunnery training ship, Lancaster departed Portsmouth 8 January 1899 and cruised along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies. From 3 June 1900 to 4 March 1901 she made a cruise to European waters, returning to the United States via the West Indies and La Guaira, Venezuela. She continued cruising the Atlantic training landsmen until she decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard 1 May 1902. Lancaster served as receiving ship at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, 16 November 1903 to 31 March 1912, and was transferred to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Public Health Service, on 1 February 1913. Her name was stricken from the Navy list on 31 December 1915. Lancaster served the U.S. Public Health Service as a quarantine detention ship at Reedy Island, Delaware, Quarantine Station until 1920, then was transferred to the New York Quarantine Station for similar use. Her hull was broken in 1933. Her gold eagle figurehead is now displayed at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.

From the 1944 film Gaslight. A smoking jacket is an informal men's style of lounge jacket originally intended for tobacco smoking, designed in the 1850s. A classic-styled smoking jacket comes in a shawl collar, turn-up cuffs, toggle or button fastenings, or simply be closed with a tie belt. It is usually made from velvet, silk, or both. Originating in the 1850s, The Gentleman's Magazine of London, England, defined the smoking jacket as a \\"kind of short robe de chambre [i.e. a banyan], of velvet, cashmere, plush, merino or printed flannel, lined with bright colours, ornamented with brandebourgs [i.e. frogs], olives or large buttons.\\" It was out of the smoking jacket that the dinner jacket evolved in 1865, essentially as a dress coat without tail, following the example of the then Prince, later King Edward VII (1841‚Äì1910), preceding the semi-formal black tie in Western dress codes. As such, the smoking jacket has occurred also with this level of formality ever since, particularly when smoking pipes and cigars. Etymology The smoking jacket had its name after its associated tobacco activity. As a false friend, the name carried on to its derivation the dinner jacket in several non-English languages. In Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and other European languages, the term smoking indicates a dinner jacket, that is a tuxedo. History James FitzGerald (1818‚Äì1896) wearing a smoking jacket in 1868. In the 17th century, goods began flowing into Europe from Asia and the Americas, bringing in spices, tobacco, coffee, and silks. It became fashionable to be depicted in one's portrait wearing a silk robe de chambre, or dressing gown. One of the earliest mentions of this garment comes from Samuel Pepys, who desired to be depicted in his portrait in a silk gown but could not afford one, so he rented one: > Thence home and eat one mouthful, and so to Hale's and there sat until > almost quite dark upon working my gowne, which I hired to be drawn (in) > it‚Äîan Indian gown, and I do see all the reason to expect a most excellent > picture of it. ‚ÄîDiary, 30 March 1666 In the 18th century, gentlemen often referred to a specific style of \\"night gown\\" called the banyan, a knee-length robe, a more comfortable in design than the justaucorps, onto which shawl collars became recurrent. 19th century A smoking jacket from the 1860s exhibitioned at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, United States. The short smoking jacket soon evolved from these silk garments. When the Crimean War during the 1850s popularised Turkish tobacco in Britain, smoking gained in popularity. After dinner, a gentleman might put on a smoking jacket and retreat to a smoking room. The jacket was intended to absorb the smoke from his cigar or pipe and protect his clothing from falling ash. 20th century A gentleman in a smoking jacket enjoying tobacco, accompanied by a dachshund puppy (1930). The smoking jacket remained a popular accessory into the 20th century. An editorial in The Washington Post in 1902 gave the opinion that the smoking jacket was \\"synonymous with comfort\\", while a Pennsylvania newspaper opined in 1908 that it would be \\"putting it mildly to say that a new House Coat or Smoking Jacket will give any man reason for elation\\". Famous wearers included Fred Astaire (who was buried in a smoking jacket), Cary Grant, Dean Martin, Jon Pertwee and Frank Sinatra. While smoking jackets declined in popularity from the 1950s, a minority of wearers still persisted; Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner (1926‚Äì2017) was a notable example. In its January/February 1999 issue, Cigar Aficionado stated that it was time the smoking jacket be brought back, perhaps as an \\"alternative type of formalwear\\".

Cooper also admitted in court to the kidnap and rape of an underage female in Pennsylvania during a burglary attempthttp://www.sbcountyda.org/Portals/8/PressReleases/2018/DA%20Response%20to%20Cooper%20clemency%20petition.pdf?ver=2018-05-23-110906-040 and was accused of rape by a second woman in California. Since his arrest, Cooper, who is African American, has become active in writing letters from prison asserting his innocence, protesting racism in the American criminal justice system, and opposing the death penalty. Cooper's habeas corpus petitions have been denied. The evidence in the case has been reviewed during the original trial, by the California Supreme Court, by the United States District Court, and by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2007, two judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that \\"As the district court, and all state courts, have repeatedly found, evidence of Cooper's guilt was overwhelming. The tests that he asked for to show his innocence 'once and for all' show nothing of the sort.\\" In a concurring opinion, however, Judge Margaret McKeown said she was troubled that the court could not resolve the question of Cooper's guilt \\"once and for all\\" and noted that significant evidence bearing on Cooper's culpability has been lost, destroyed or left unpursued. In a dissenting opinion written in 2009, Judge William A. Fletcher began by stating: \\"the State of California may be about to execute an innocent man.\\" Fletcher wrote that the police may have tampered with the evidence and that the Ninth Circuit should have reheard the case en banc and should have \\"ordered the district judge to give Cooper the fair hearing he has never had.\\" Five judges joined in Fletcher's dissent and five more stated that Cooper has never had a fair hearing to determine his innocence.  Early life  Kevin Cooper was born Richard Goodman on January 8, 1958, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When he was two months old, his mother placed him in an orphanage. At the age of six months, he was adopted by Melvin and Esther Cooper, who renamed him Kevin Cooper. As a child, Kevin Cooper was subject to physical abuse and ran away from home numerous times. As an adolescent, he was sent to juvenile custody numerous times.  Previous criminal record  Cooper had an extensive criminal past that included rape and burglary. He was sentenced to a one-to-two year prison term in 1977 for burglarizing a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Cooper later stipulated in court to kidnapping and raping a minor female who interrupted him during a burglary in Pennsylvania. During the crime, he threatened to kill the teen-age victim. Over the next five years, he was convicted and sentenced to jail twice for burglaries and was released on probation in 1982. He escaped from custodial settings in Pennsylvania 11 times. In late 1982, Cooper fled to California after escaping from a Pennsylvania psychiatric facility. In California, Cooper was soon convicted of two burglaries in the Los Angeles area. He began serving a four-year sentence under the alias David TrautmanPeople v. Cooper, 53 Cal. 3d 771 (1991) at the California Institution for Men (CIM) in Chino on April 29, 1983, where he was assigned to the minimum security section. On June 2, 1983, Cooper climbed through a hole in the prison fence and walked away from the prison across an open field.Cooper v. Brown, 565 F.3d 581 (2009), p.582  Chino Hills murders and arrest  On the morning of June 5, 1983, Bill Hughes arrived at a semi-rural home in Chino Hills, California, where his 11-year-old son Christopher had spent the night. Inside, he found Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica and his own son dead. They had been chopped with a hatchet, sliced with a knife, and stabbed with an ice-pick. Josh Ryen, the 8-year-old son of Douglas and Peggy, had survived. His throat had been cut. Mrs. Ryen's purse was in plain sight on the kitchen counter, but no money had been taken. The family station wagon was gone; it was discovered several days later in Long Beach, California, about 50 miles southwest of Chino Hills. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department deputies who responded to the call identified Kevin Cooper as the likely killer. He had admittedly hidden out in the vacant house next door, the Lease house, 125 yards away, for two days. He had made repeated calls from this house to two female friends asking for money to help with his escape, but they had refused. Cooper testified at trial that he had left that house as soon as it got dark on June 4 and had hitchhiked to Mexico. It was established that Cooper checked into a hotel in Tijuana, about 130 miles south of Chino Hills, at 4:30 pm on June 5. There, Cooper befriended an American couple who owned a sailboat. He hitched a ride on the boat with them as a crew member cruising the Baja and Southern California coasts. Seven weeks later, while still staying on the couple's boat, Cooper was accused of raping a woman on a boat docked nearby. While visiting the sheriff's office to report the crime, the rape victim saw a wanted poster with Cooper's photograph and identified him as the rapist. Deputies and coast guard personnel detained him as he tried to swim ashore. Evidence There is disagreement about Cooper‚Äôs guilt and the evidence supporting it. The evidence used to convict Cooper includes the following. * A khaki green button identical to the buttons on CIM jackets was found in the room where Cooper slept. The button had blood on it that could have come from either Cooper or the victims. * A blood-stained rope was found in the closet of the bedroom used by Cooper. The rope was similar to another rope found in the Ryen driveway, but lacked a center cord. * Luminol testing seemed to indicate that there were Bloody footprints in the hallway leading to the bedroom Cooper used and on the shower walls in the Lease house. * Hair similar to that of Jessica Ryen was found in the bathroom sink in the Lease house. * A hair removed from the bathroom shower in the Lease house was similar to Douglas Ryen‚Äôs hair. * A hatchet that went missing from the Lease house was very similar to the hatchet found on the side of the road by a citizen. The hatchet found on the road side contained blood and hairs that were consistent with that of Douglas and Josh Ryen. A sheath was found on the floor near the bedroom where Cooper slept * Buck knives, an 11-inch hunting knife, and ice picks were missing from the Lease house. The strap for one of the buck knives was found on the floor in the bedroom Cooper slept in. * Blood Stain A-41 was identified as belonging to Kevin Cooper, though there are questions regarding the handling of the evidence and whether it was tampered with prior to testing. * ProKed Tennis Shoe prints consistent with the size and pattern of the shoes given to Cooper at CIM were found in the Lease house and in several parts of the Ryen house. * Plant burrs recovered from Jessica Ryen's nightgown were similar to those found on a blanket inside a closet in the Lease house and in the Ryen car. These burs were also similar to burrs from vegetation between the hideout house and the Ryen house. * Role Rite tobacco, the type Cooper used, which is free to CIM inmates and not available at retail, was found in the Ryen‚Äôs car and the bedroom Cooper stayed in. * Cigarette butts with Cooper‚Äôs saliva were found in the Ryen car. Post- conviction DNA testing confirmed that DNA from one of the butts would match one in 19 billion people while the other would match one in 110 million people. * Hair consistent with Cooper‚Äôs was found in the Ryen car. Trial On Cooper's motion, the court changed the venue of the trial from San Bernardino County to San Diego County. Cooper pleaded guilty to the charge of escape from prison. In videotaped testimony, Josh Ryen said that the evening before the murders, just before the family left for the Blade barbecue, three Mexican men came to the Ryen home looking for work. Ryen did not identify the killer, but said in an audiotape with his treating psychiatrist that he saw the back of a single man attacking his mother. Ryen told a sheriff he thought three men had done it because \\"I thought it was them. And, you know, like they stopped up that night,\\" but he did not actually see three people during the incident. Cooper testified in his own defense. He admitted escaping from CIM, hiding out and sleeping at the Lease house, but denied committing the murders or being in the Ryen house. Cooper said he left the Lease house on foot, hitchhiked, stole a purse, and eventually made his way to Mexico. The defense pointed out the inconsistencies in Ryen's testimony, presented evidence of other events apparently not involving Cooper that might have had something to do with the killings, and presented an expert witness that criticized the forensic investigation. A jury convicted Cooper of four counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder with the intentional infliction of great bodily injury, and then imposed the death penalty. There was also a stipulation entered during the penalty phase of Cooper‚Äôs trial that ‚ÄúKevin Cooper was the man who abducted (the female minor) on October 8th of 1982 from the Heath residence, kidnapped her, and later raped her in Frock Park.\\"  Possible manipulation of evidence  Cooper has continuously denied any involvement in the crimes for almost 30 years. Some arguments supporting his innocence include: * Judge Fletcher writes that while a button found in the house came from a green prison jacket, \\"uncontradicted evidence at trial showed that Cooper was wearing a brown or tan prison-issued jacket when he escaped.\\" Deputy Patrick Whelchel would later tell Cooper's defense that he had been asked to acquire a prison issue jacket and shoes from the prison within a day or two of the murders. * Judge Fletcher suggested that since the chemical test used to detect blood also reacted to bleach, and since a previous occupant had admitted at trial to cleaning the shower and sink with bleach just prior to vacating, that the supposed blood in the shower and sink could have potentially been the bleach used by the tenant to clean up. Luminol testing also reacts to coppery substances, plant enzymes and excrement, raising an alternate explanation for the luminol results in the hallway. * The witnesses who identified the hatchet as coming from the hideout house only did so after being spoken to by Mary Ann Hughes, the mother of Christopher Hughes. When the defense sought to question witnesses about this during the trial they were blocked from doing so. * The fingerprints of Officer Stephen Moran were recovered from the interior of the closet where Cooper had his sleeping nest, and were determined to have been left the day before the evidence in the closet was officially found. Moran himself would deny ever entering the closet. * Judge Fletcher suggested that preservatives found in the blood on the tan T-shirt indicated that it may have been planted (arguing that Huff ignored testing which showed that four of the alleged control samples either had DNA or were inconclusive and thus could not be legitimate controls, and that Huff had both failed to test the new sample to see if it was blood and ignored that the EDTA corresponded with the DNA). \\"If the EDTA testing already performed shows that Cooper's blood was planted on the t-shirt, or if further EDTA testing does the same thing, that showing greatly increases the likelihood that much of the evidence introduced at trial was false,\\" Fletcher wrote. Some argue that Gregonis planted Cooper's blood in order to ensure a positive result. *Prosecutors claimed during the trial that a bloody footprint found on the Ryens‚Äô bedsheet and another print on a spa cover outside the Ryen home matched the size and type of the Pro-Ked ‚Äò‚ÄòDude‚Äô‚Äô sneakers Cooper was issued inside the prison, further claiming that the shoe was distributed solely through prisons and other government institutions like the one Cooper had escaped only two days prior to the murders. Cooper‚Äôs attorneys, however, obtained statements from James Taylor, an inmate who said he issued Cooper PF Flyer shoes, and Midge Carroll, the former prison warden, who said the shoes the prison purchased for inmates were widely available to the public through major retail outlets such as Sears. This information was enough to temporarily put a halt to his execution for further examination. Don Luck, a Stride-Rite Executive, would also say that it was possible to acquire the shoes through the company catalog, again impeaching the state's claim that the shoes were unavailable through retail. The state would in turn argue that they had never argued that the shoes were unique. * In the initial search of the Ryen's station wagon, no cigarette butts were found. Judge Fletcher writes, \\"Some of those cigarette butts could have easily been planted in the car. Moreover, after initial forensic testing, paper from a hand-rolled cigarette butt supposedly found in the station wagon was described as consumed. That same paper later \\"reappeared\\" and was offered into evidence. When the paper \\"reappeared,\\" it was significantly larger than the paper in the cigarette butt that had been tested.\\" * Multiple cigarettes recovered from Cooper's hideout were never entered into evidencehttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate- courts/F3/357/1019/615497. The same officers who processed the house (Craig Ogino and David Stockwell) would also be the ones to discover the cigarettes in the car. * The tan t shirt with Cooper's blood on it was not prison issued, and none of the people in the lease house recognized it despite identifying other items of clothing that Cooper had stolen from the house.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/357/1019/615497 *The sole survivor, Josh Ryen, indicated with a communication board to a social worker and deputy in the emergency room that 3 or 4 white men committed the murders. Judge Fletcher wrote, \\"Deputies misrepresented his recollections and gradually shaped his testimony so that it was consistent with the prosecution's theory that there was only one killer.\\" * Records would show that a second, now missing, blue shirt had been recovered near the bar shortly before the tan shirt presented at trial. Judge Fletcher pointed out that the police's own procedures meant that the shirt would have only appeared in the records if it were found by a civilian (since the tan shirt was found by an officer the records could not have been referring to the shirt), which impeached the state's claim that there was only ever one shirt. The records also described the shirt as having what looked like blood on it, and one of the state's witnesses admitted that one of the three men had been wearing a blue shirt. In spite of this, Judge Huff accepted the state's claim and blocked the defense from pursuing the matter. * Donald Gamundoy, a social worker who interviewed Josh prior to the police questioning, stated at trial that Josh had not only identified 3 attackers but specifically stated they were not Mexican or African American. This contradicts the state's claim that Josh confused there being multiple murderers with his memory of three Mexican men that were looking for landscaping work the day before the killing. * Blond hairs were found clutched in Jessica Ryen's hand.KGO Radio, Pat Thurston Show, 8p.m.,12-14-10 Under oath, Dr Ed Blake conceded that most of the hairs had never been tested, and when Judge Huff did order retesting she limited the testing to hairs that were proven not to have Antigen roots (essentially guaranteeing a negative result).  An alternate suspect  Over the years, the defense has raised the possibility that a man named Lee Furrow was the actual killer. Arguments in favor of the alternate suspect theory *Judge Justin Quackenbush, in a 2010 lecture at Gonzaga University, wrote that on June 9, Diana Roper called the Sheriff's Department to tell them that her boyfriend, Lee Furrow, had come home in the early hours of June 4. He changed out of his overalls which he left on the floor of a closet. He was not wearing a tan t-shirt that he had been wearing earlier in the day. He left after five minutes and did not return. [Roper and her father] both concluded that the overalls were spattered with blood. The Sheriff's Department never tested the overalls for blood, never turned them over to Cooper or his lawyers, and disposed of them on the day of Cooper's arraignment. * Phone Logs proved that a deputy sheriff made multiple attempts to give the coveralls to the lead investigator. This contradicted the deputy's claim that he never considered the coveralls of value and seemed to show that he had in fact believed Diana Roper's story. A supervisor admitted to an investigator that he signed off on disposing of the overalls, thereby impeaching deputy Eckley's testimony at trial that he made that decision on his own initiative. *Roper later provided an affidavit stating that a bloody tan t-shirt found beside a road leading from the murder house was Furrow's t-shirt. It was a Fruit-of-the-Loom t-shirt with a breast pocket. Roper stated that she recognized it because she had bought it for him. In addition, no one in the hideout house recognized the tan shirt despite positively identifying other items of clothing that Cooper had stolen. * Roper also stated that a bloody hatchet found beside a road leading from the murder house matched Furrow's hatchet that was now missing from her garage. *A man named Clarence Ray Allen (executed by California in 2006) previously had a disagreement with the Ryens over a horse he purchased from them.Nicholas D.

Accessed 12/25/2018. https://durangoherald.com/articles/224816 Diana Roper's boyfriend, Lee Furrow, was an employee of Allen's security company. In 1977, Furrow pled guilty to murdering in 1974, on Allen's orders as part of a burglary coverup, Mary Sue Kitts, a 17-year-old girlfriend of Allen's son.\\"THE CHARLEY PROJECT: Mary Sue Kitts.\\" THE CHARLEY PROJECT.

He had been part of a murderous gang, but had been given a short sentence in return for turning state's evidence against the leader of the gang [Clarence Ray Allen]. The leader [Allen] was sentenced to death. Furrow told friends that while he was part of the gang he killed a girl [Mary Sue Kitts], cut up her body, and thrown her body parts into the Kern River.\\" * Judge Quackenbush related in his 2010 Gonzaga lecture that in Diana Roper's June 9 call to the Sheriff's Department she told them that when Lee Furrow had come home in the early hours of June 4 he arrived in an unfamiliar station wagon with some people who stayed in the car. * A further investigation revealed that Lee Furrow's stepmother lived less than 5 miles from where the victim's station wagon was ultimately found. Arguments against the alternate suspect theory According to the Ninth Circuit, Roper‚Äôs allegations ‚Äúlack credibility.‚Äù Roper was abusing drugs and hallucinating the night she says she saw Furrow. She also had a motive to disparage Furrow because he left her on the night of the murders and began a sexual relationship with her childhood friend.  Post-trial DNA testing  In 2001, Cooper became the first death row inmate in California to successfully request post-conviction DNA testing of evidence. The results of those DNA tests failed to exonerate him of the 1983 murders and indicated 1) Cooper's DNA was present both at the crime scene and in the stolen station wagon, 2) hairs found on three of the victims were likely their own, and 3) no DNA belonging to other assailants was present. Blood testing DNA testing confirmed that Cooper's blood was at the crime scene. However, it was later found that a blood vial containing Cooper's blood possibly contained a second individual's blood; Judge Huff would block any attempt to pursue the matter during the hearings and the vial itself would later be found empty when the defense won the right to retest it in 2019. More importantly, prosecution expert Daniel Gregonis had checked Cooper's blood out for 24 hours without informing Cooper's attorneys (alongside his saliva and the bloodstain recovered from the house). This is significant because of two key pieces of evidence that relied on blood from Cooper: * Gregonis' initials were on a pillbox that contained A-41 recovered from the house, as well as the date he checked it out. According to lab practice it is common to mark the seal when it is opened. This has caused some to speculate that Gregonis was untruthful when he later claimed that he never opened the vial. * A bloodstain located on a T-shirt that was found beside a road some distance from the Ryen home; the shirt has several blood stains. ** Doug Ryen was the donor of a bloodstain. ** Cooper was the donor of blood on the t-shirt, in particular, two blood smears and possibly of blood spatter. * Cooper's DNA was not on the hatchet, one of the murder weapons. The hatchet had blood from victims Jessica Ryen, Doug Ryen, and Chris Hughes (Peggy Ryen and Josh Ryen cannot be excluded as minor contributors). This has caused some people to argue that Daniel Gregonis planted Cooper's blood on the evidence in order to ensure a positive result EDTA testing After the blood test results came back supporting Cooper‚Äôs guilt he claimed that the blood had been planted and asked that the T shirt be tested for presence of EDTA, a preservative. High levels of EDTA would show that the blood came from a vial rather than directly from Cooper. The EDTA testing was conducted by Cooper‚Äôs chosen expert Dr. Ballard but failed to show elevated levels of EDTA. While Judge Huff would claim that the blood stain had levels of EDTA lower than most controls on the T shirt and ‚Äúdramatically lower than the level of EDTA expected in a tampering scenario involving blood from a purple-topped tube\\", Judge William Fletcher pointed to DNA testing done by the state's expert Terry Lee as proof that the controls actually had DNA in them, and were thus not legitimate controls at all. He also uses a graph to argue that the EDTA corresponded with the DNA in each of the stains. Additional testing by Dr. Gary Suizdak on ten specimens found significant levels of EDTA. However, according to both Suizdak and the state's expert Dr. Terry Lee, the samples were most likely contaminated by EDTA present in Suizdak‚Äôs lab. This claim has been disputed, and when Cooper's attorney's asked to see Dr. Siuzdak's notes to verify his story they were denied. Hair testing According to Dr. Terry Melton, the hairs obtained from Jessica Ryen‚Äôs hand were either animal hairs or human hairs that came from herself or someone maternally related to her. Other hairs selected by Cooper‚Äôs expert Dr. Peter DeForest came from domestic dogs. Nevertheless, Judge Huff had also limited testing to hair without Antigen roots, essentially guaranteeing a negative result. Cigarette Testing When Cooper's hideout was searched multiple cigarettes were not processed into evidence. The Cigarettes were also listed as consumed prior to the trial. According to Dr Ed Blake's notes the Cigarettes were 4 mm long and yellow in color. In 2001, the cigarettes were white and had grown to 7 mm. Notably, when Daniel Gregonis checked out A-41 he also checked out Cooper's saliva as well as a known blood sample.  Assessment by courts, governors, and independent groups   California Supreme Court  The Supreme Court of California upheld Cooper's conviction in May 1991. Cooper was scheduled to be executed on February 10, 2004; on February 8 a three judge panel consisting of Judges Pamela Rymer, Ronald Gould and James Browning heard Cooper's petition and rejected it by a vote of 2‚Äì1. Judge Browning, the lone dissenter, was able to assemble enough judges to get an en banc ruling blocking the execution to allow further DNA testing. Ultimately, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the stay, effectively making it impossible to carry out the death warrant. The postponement followed a campaign by various groups in the Bay Area and around the country, such as the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, the ACLU, Death Penalty Focus, and The Mobilization to Free Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Denial of clemency by California Governor Schwarzenegger  On January 30, 2004, the office of Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger issued the following statement regarding his decision not to grant clemency to Kevin Cooper: On December 17, 2010, Cooper filed a second clemency petition to Governor Schwarzenegger. This petition laid out new developments in the evidence that had not been known when the first petition was denied in 2004.Petition for Executive Clemency, Kevin Cooper, December 17, 2010 The second clemency petition also cited the conclusions and observations of twelve appellate judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, including the fact that blood taken from Cooper after he was arrested was contaminated with the DNA of another person,Cooper v. Brown, 565 F.3d 581, 599 (9th Cir. 2009) that a sheriff's deputy had lied at Cooper's trial about destruction of key evidence,Exhibit 11, 29:22-31 of Petition for Executive Clemency 2010, citing transcript of miscellaneous hearing before the Hon. Marilyn Huff, Friday April 1, 2005 and that three witnesses, never interviewed by the prosecution, had come forward with strong evidence of other possible perpetrators.[Petition, page 2] Just before Governor Schwarzenegger left office in January 2011, his office wrote a letter to Cooper's lawyer stating that the application \\"raises many evidentiary concerns which deserve a thorough and careful review of voluminous records.\\"Letter to Norman Hile from Andrea Lynn Hoch, Legal Affairs Secretary to Governor Schwarzenegger, dated January 2, 2011 The letter further stated that since the Governor had only two weeks left in office, he had decided to leave the matter for Governor-elect Jerry Brown's determination.  U.S. Ninth Circuit Court and U.S Supreme Court deny appeals  Cooper has filed multiple appeals and applications for a writ of habeas corpus, all of which have been denied. On December 4, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Cooper's third federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The panel concluded: \\"As the district court, and all state courts, have repeatedly found, evidence of Cooper's guilt was overwhelming. The tests that he asked for to show his innocence 'once and for all' show nothing of the sort.\\"Cooper v. Brown, 510 F.3d 870 (9th Cir. 2007). On May 11, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied Cooper's request for a rehearing en banc of the 2007 panel decision. Four judges (Fletcher, Wardlaw, Fisher, and Reinhardt) filed dissents, indicating that they disagreed with the decision. Judge Fletcher stated that there was a strong likelihood that the police tampered with the evidence and accused Judge Huff of deliberately ignoring the Court's instructions to perform proper testing, while Judge Wardlaw stated \\"as far as due process is concerned 25 years of flawed proceedings are as good as no proceedings at all.\\" Eleven judges joined the dissents (fourteen votes were required to grant the request for a rehearing), though Judge Stephen Reinhardt hinted that the gap may have been closer. Judge Rymer, who authored the original panel decision, filed a concurrence defending both the original decision and the decision to deny an en banc hearing. Cooper's petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on November 30, 2009.  Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recommends a review  In April 2011 Cooper filed a petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights(IACHR) alleging that his human rights had been violated in multiple respects by his prosecution, conviction and death sentence. The IACHR concluded that the United States had violated Articles I, II, XVIII and XXVI of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. The Commission found eight instances where Cooper's due process rights had been violated, that Cooper had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and that there were serious questions about racial discrimination in Cooper's prosecution. The IACHR recommended that Cooper be granted \\"effective relief, including the review of his trial and sentence.\\"  American Bar Association recommendation for clemency  On Saturday, March 19, 2016, the president of the American Bar Association (ABA), Paulette Brown, submitted a letter to Governor of California Jerry Brown, suggesting that Cooper be granted clemency due to claims of racial bias, police misconduct, evidence tampering and poor- quality defense counsel. \\"We recommend that this investigation include testing of forensic evidence still available to be analyzed to put to rest the questions that continue to plague his death sentence. This is the only course of action that can ensure that Mr. Cooper receives due process and the protection of his rights under the Constitution,\\" Ms. Brown wrote.  New DNA testing order by California Governor Brown  In May 2018, Nicholas Kristof wrote an article in The New York Times highlighting the case, arguing that the truth could be determined by doing advanced testing on the bloodstained t-shirt, the hatchet handle and the hand towel used by the murderer and including diagrams showing both that Lee Furrow's stepmother lived close to where the victim's car was recovered and that Officer Steven Moran most likely planted evidence to frame Cooper. Soon afterward, Kamala Harris (who was at first against the testNicholas Kristof \\"Was Kevin Cooper framed for Murder?\\") and Dianne Feinstein both publicly called for advanced DNA testing. In response, DA Michael Ramos submitted a response to Cooper's petition, calling for the petition to be refused. Ramos would also file to have Cooper executed following his failed attempt to be re-elected. On July 3, Jerry Brown hinted that he would potentially be willing to approve DNA Testing, sending Cooper's attorneys a list of questions. On August 17, the Defense submitted their response, revealing that they had managed to acquire Lee Furrow's DNA for testing. On October 6, Nick Kristof wrote a follow-up in which he reported that Lee Furrow had told him that he was now open for testing to \\"clear his name.\\" In December 2018, outgoing California Governor Brown ordered new DNA testing in the Cooper case.ALENE TCHEKMEDYIAN \\"Gov.

It is the birthplace and one of nine academic divisions of Emory University. The college is located on Emory University's original campus east of Emory's current Atlanta campus. Students who enroll in Oxford College complete an associate of the arts degree there, after which they can continue their studies at Emory's Atlanta campus to pursue a bachelor degree without any additional applications. Oxford College was built one mile north of Covington, Georgia, as \\"Emory College\\" by the Georgia Methodist Conference in 1836, when they granted Ignatius Alphonso Few a charter to open a college named after the late Methodist bishop John Emory. Three years later, the Georgia state legislature incorporated the land around the college into a newly chartered city named after the University of Oxford, the alma mater of the founders of the Methodist movement. In the beginning of the 20th century, Emory College received a monetary and land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, then-president of The Coca-Cola Company, and moved its operations to Druid Hills, adjacent to Atlanta. Afterward, the Oxford campus continued to be used as a college preparatory school, junior college, four-year college, and finally the two- year Emory liberal arts program known today as Oxford College. Oxford College has an enrollment of nearly 1,000 freshman and sophomore students. Campus organizations include various community service groups, interest clubs, and social clubs, the school's replacement for traditional fraternities and sororities. The university-wide unofficial mascot, a skeleton named \\"Lord Dooley\\", has its origins in the Oxford campus. In terms of athletics, the college participates in NJCAA Division III sports, with the men's and women's tennis teams having won national championships multiple times. History Founding and early history In 1833, the Georgia Methodist Conference considered establishing a church-sponsored manual labor school where students would combine farm work with a college preparatory curriculum. Two years later, the Conference opened the Georgia Conference Manual Labor School, but the institution soon faced financial challenges and disbanded. After the labor school's failure, the Conference granted Methodist preacher Ignatius Few a charter to establish a new college named after John Emory, a Methodist bishop who was involved in the labor school's founding but had died in a carriage accident before it opened. In 1836, the new school, Emory College, was established on a tract of land in Newton County, one mile north of Covington, Georgia. The site was chosen because of its distance from the city, which the school's founders feared would be a source of distraction for its students. The campus and the immediate surroundings were planned and built in 1837 by Edward Lloyd Thomas, a Georgia land surveyor who also planned the city of Columbus, Georgia. On 23 December 1839, the state legislature incorporated the city of Oxford, named after the alma mater of the founders of the Methodist movement, Charles and John Wesley, the University of Oxford. Because the college and town were founded only three years apart, many of the town's early residents were involved in the college's founding and continued to be involved in its daily activities. On 17 September 1838, two years after the college's chartering, President Ignatius Few and three faculty members welcomed fifteen freshmen and sophomores into its inaugural class. To raise money to maintain the school, Few began selling lots around the college to local citizens. The founders envisaged a curriculum that would rest squarely on the classics and mathematics, with four years' study of Greek, Latin, and mathematics, and three years' study of the English Bible and the sciences of geography, astronomy, and chemistry. According to historian Henry M. Bullock, the founders intended Emory to be, \\"in the fullest sense of the term, a Christian college\\". =Literary societies= alt=A white, columned structure Sometime in 1837, a year before the inaugural class of students were enrolled, the new student body founded the Phi Gamma literary society on campus. The society adapted the motto: Scientia et Religio Libertatis Custodes (\\"Science and Religion ‚Äì Freedom Guardians\\"). In 1851, Phi Gamma Hall was constructed and remains the oldest structure still standing on Oxford's campus. A few years later, Phi Gamma decided it needed a rival society to compete with. Consequently, fourteen members withdrew from Phi Gamma to establish Few Society, named after Ignatius Few. The facilities and libraries of each debate society were open to members of either society. The two halls oppose each other across the quad, and both buildings are variations of two-story Greek Revival structures with temple form designs and columned porticos. Debate topics included the justifiability of war, women's suffrage, the morality of slavery, and prohibition. In 1850, members of the two literary societies debated whether Georgia should secede from the Union. A vote on the matter by members of both societies resolved for Georgia to remain in the Union. However, when the American Civil War broke out, both debate societies temporarily suspended their activities as members left school to fight in the war. Both Phi Gamma and Few Hall were used as infirmaries for wounded soldiers. Civil War and Reconstruction Financial tension had reduced the college's income and student body prior to the outbreak of hostilities. When war broke out in the summer of 1861, the college's administration decided to temporarily cease all academic operations, and Emory College remained closed for the duration of the fighting. During the war, college facilities were used by both Northern and Southern soldiers as military headquarters and infirmaries, and many deceased soldiers are buried near campus. The school's library and other archives were damaged and later destroyed due to mishandling by military generals. It was not until the summer of 1866 that the campus was able to return to its academic functions, reopening with twenty students and three professors. Emory College continued to struggle with financial hardships after the war, and was only able to continue operations with the aid of a state G.I. Bill. Ignatius A. Few as one of the founders of Emory College.alt=A white marble obelisk In 1880, the school's fortunes reversed when College President Atticus G. Haygood delivered a Thanksgiving Day sermon expressing gratitude for the end of slavery and calling on the South to put the past behind it to \\"cultivate the growth of industry\\". The speech captured the attention of George I. Seney, a Brooklyn banker and Methodist. He initially gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In total, Seney invested more than $250,000 in Emory College, helping to erect the Victorian Gothic-style administrative building in the center of Oxford College that bears his name. The bell in the Seney Hall clock tower is the oldest permanent monument at Emory University today. Cast in 1796, the bell was a gift from Alexander Means, the fourth President of Emory College, who had received it from Queen Victoria. Move to Atlanta By the turn of the 20th century, Emory College had produced several notable graduates. Alben W. Barkley, who graduated in 1900, represented Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives and in the Senate. In 1949, at age 71, he became the oldest Vice President of the United States in history. Thomas M. Rivers became one of the nation's premier virologists at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School, investigating encephalitis and smallpox and later leading the National Science Foundation's quest for a polio vaccine. Dumas Malone went on to become the head of Harvard University Press, one of the nation's leading academic publishers, and completed a Pulitzer Prize-winning six-volume study of Thomas Jefferson when he was over 90 years of age. Wilbur A. Carlton, a student at Emory College in 1910, described his experiences at the school at the time: Soon, the Georgia Methodist Conference began discussing transforming Emory College into a university, with Birmingham and Atlanta bidding to host the proposed institution. Atlanta was chosen as the home of the new Emory University after Asa Griggs Candler, then-president of the Coca-Cola Company, deeded the university of land near the city's downtown and contributed $1 million to the school's endowment. Candler had been reluctant to donate money to a project that he called \\"a crumbling castle\\", but his brother, Warren Candler, convinced him otherwise. Asa Candler served as chair of the Emory University Board of Trustees and his brother later served as university president. The Oxford campus continued to be used after the school's move to Atlanta in 1915. At first, the site was organized into the Emory University Academy, a preparatory school modeled after Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy to respond to the failure of the state's public high schools. By 1921, the academy had reached its peak enrollment of three hundred, doubling its previous enrollment record as a college. Due to financial concerns, including the loss of third-party financial support, Emory University cut programs for all academic divisions at the academy, laid off faculty, and raised tuition. By the mid-1930s, with the introduction of college-level curriculum, the University Academy was renamed Emory Junior College at Oxford and the site was reorganized into a two-year junior college. In 1947, influenced by the experimental models of integrating secondary and post-secondary education at the University of Chicago, Emory and Oxford leaders reorganized the Oxford curriculum into the South's first accredited four-year junior college. The curriculum combined an accelerated program for the last two years of high school with the first two years of college. It ended in 1963 after facing enrollment shortages. In response, Dean Virgil Eady recommended a name change to Oxford College of Emory University and advocated the position that Oxford is part of Emory University and not a \\"quasi- independent college at Oxford\\". The new college was then set up as a two-year liberal arts program, similar in concept to the original Emory College model. Campus Edward Thomas hand-drew this design for the town of Oxford and Emory College in 1837.alt=A hand-drawn map depicting the original plan for the Town of Oxford Oxford College is located on of land in Newton County, approximately east of Emory's Atlanta campus. It is in the center of Oxford, a town located about half a mile north of Interstate 20, and is directly bounded by Georgia State Route 81 (signed as Emory Street) to the east and the Fleming Woods to the west. Emory University's bus routes provide service from Oxford to the Atlanta campus, local shopping centers, and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority stations. The college campus and surrounding city of Oxford was planned by surveyor Edward Thomas with input from Ignatius Few. The original plan included five north-south streets radiating from the campus in the south, although the topography to the west of the campus prevented two of those streets from being developed. Today, much of the college is organized around a pedestrian-only quadrangle in the center, surrounded by a few nearby streets and hiking trails that make up the Fleming Woods. The college also owns and operates an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) organic farm that was established in 2014. It is utilized as both an educational environment for related courses, and as a functioning farm that sells its produce at local farmers' markets. In 1975, the campus and many of its older buildings, such as Phi Gamma Hall and Seney Hall, and other surrounding structures were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as the Oxford Historic District. In 1885, the Grand Masonic Lodge of Georgia erected a white marble obelisk in memory of Few in the center of the quad. Directly south of the monument is Seney Hall, a five-story Victorian Gothic-style building topped by a clock tower and bell. At the end of every academic year, the bell is rung once in honor of each graduating student. Seney Hall is flanked to the west by Hopkins Hall and the Williams Gymnasium, and to the west by Language Hall, which was recently renovated and restored in 2013. Further to the east sits Candler Hall, which was built in the Neoclassical architectural style and served as the school library until 1970. Today it is a student center and houses a bookstore. Phi Gamma Hall and Few Hall, which used to house the college's literary societies, sit across from each other on the quad. The other buildings that stand on the quad are: Humanities Hall, the Jolley Residential Center, Oxford Science Building, Tarbutton Performance Arts Center (which now adjoins Few Hall), Pierce Hall, and a library containing nearly 100,000 volumes. Academics alt=An image of the red-bricked Seney Hall and its clocktower Oxford College, as part of Emory's undergraduate bachelor's program, offers introductory and intermediate courses that contribute to undergraduate degrees in eighty-five majors, the most popular being: economics, psychology, biology, business administration, neuroscience and behavioral biology, and political science. All courses are on a credit hour system. Some classes are designated \\"theory-practice service learning\\" courses, which integrate theory learning in the classroom with real-world application. For example, students enrolled in the Sociology of Food course dedicate certain hours a week working at the school's organic farm. Oxford College's student-to-faculty ratio is 21:1, and the median class size is twenty students. All students receive an associate of the arts degree on completing Oxford's curriculum, before continuing their studies in Atlanta. Faculty Oxford College has sixty-two faculty members in teaching positions, including Nitya Jacob, associate professor of biology who is one of fifteen international recipients of Science Magazines Inquiry-Based- Instruction Prize, Eloise Carter, a former President of the Association of Southeastern Biologists, Susan Ashmore, a historian whose book on the Civil Rights Act in Alabama won an award from the Southern Historical Association, and Fulbright Fellowship recipient Lucas Carpenter, a professor of literature. William Shapiro, a professor of political science who has taught at Oxford since 1979, formerly worked at the American Enterprise Institute and was a registered conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. Oxford College has a visiting scholar agreement with the University of Oxford in England, where a faculty member from each school exchanges places for at least one week and delivers public lectures at their host's location. Visiting professors in the past have included Jane Shaw and Tiffany Stern, a professor who studies Shakespearian works. Admissions For the 2018-19 academic year, Oxford College enrolled 993 students; 24% were Asian American, 14% were African American, 13% were Hispanic, and 13% were international students. These are students who applied to Emory University and chose to begin their studies for four semesters at Oxford College before automatically continuing to the School of Arts and Science in Atlanta. Oxford graduates may also choose to apply for admission to the Goizueta Business School or the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. There were 17,864 applicants for the Oxford College class of 2023, of whom 19.8% were accepted and 475 students enrolled. Admitted students had an interquartile range (25th to 75th centile) GPA of 3.73-3.98 and SAT scores ranging from 680-760 in critical reading, 710-790 in mathematics. Oxford College maintains the same application as Emory College on the Common Application, and applicants must indicate if they wish to apply to one or both schools. In addition to regular decision, students may choose to apply and receive an admission decision early via the restrictive early decision option to either Emory College or Oxford College, or both, but not to another school. All applicants are able to participate in the Oxford Scholar program, the highest tier of which offers a full academic merit scholarship for four semesters at Oxford and four semesters at Emory. In 2017-18, sixty-two percent of undergraduates received an average financial aid package of $36,118. Student life LEED Gold.alt=External photograph of two modern residence halls Residence life All students who live on campus are housed in one of four residential halls: Haygood Hall, Jolley Residential Center, Fleming Hall, or Elizer and Murdy. These buildings range in occupancy from 117 (Haygood) to 348 (Elizer and Murdy). Originally constructed in 1913, Haygood Hall is the oldest residential hall on campus, although it had to be rebuilt after a 1981 fire destroyed the building. The newer residential halls, Elizer, Murdy, and Fleming Halls, are all LEED-certified, with the former two attaining a \\"Gold\\" certification. Students are required to enroll in a dining plan that includes meals in the Oxford Dining Hall, which serves three meals a day with limited service between meals. Fifty percent of all ingredients are sourced locally and ninety percent of waste are diverted from landfills. Some of the food served is sourced from the organic farm on campus. In terms of recreation, Williams Gymnasium houses a hybrid basketball, volleyball, and badminton court, in addition to a track, pool, weight room, and aerobic studio. There are also ten tennis courts and a regulation soccer field on campus. In addition, the nearby Fleming Woods and hiking trails can be used by Oxford students. Activities =Social clubs= The neighboring Oxford- affiliated alt=A church Oxford is different from many colleges in that it does not have traditional fraternities and sororities on campus. In their stead are organizations known as \\"social clubs\\". Historically, some of these social clubs, whose members meet regularly at social functions, were determined by geography, such as the Florida Club, South Georgia Club, and Alabama Club. Today, social clubs use the Greek alphabet system and mimic the functions of fraternities and sororities, with the exception of Dooley's Dolls. =Student organizations= Except for the D.V.S. Senior Honor Society, which was founded in 1902 and remains active today, student clubs at Oxford have not functioned reliably for long periods of time because the two-year structure of the school leads to high membership turnover. To counter this trend, the Leadership Oxford and ExCEL programs were designed by the college in 1988 to help students enhance their leadership skills. , there are over seventy-five registered student organizations which cover a variety of interests, including academic, social, cultural, religious, leisure, arts, and volunteer service. Many of Oxford's student clubs participate in community service, including volunteer-oriented clubs such as Volunteer Oxford, Bonner Leader Program and Circle K. In 2008, Oxford College students' volunteer hours helped Emory University win the Presidential Award for General Community Service, an award given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. According to a survey conducted by the college prior to 2012, ninety-two percent of Oxford students participated in community service, contributing over 10,000 hours in one year. Traditions =Dooley= alt=Dooley, Oxford's skeleton mascot, sits on a wrecked car while surrounded by student bodyguards. Lord Dooley, also known as the \\"Lord of Misrule\\" and the \\"Spirit of Emory\\", originated in Oxford and acts as Emory University's unofficial mascot. Dooley, who borrows his first name and middle initial from the first and last name of the sitting president of Emory University, has two manifestations: one at Emory's Atlanta campus, and one at Oxford. At both campuses, Dooley is represented by a student in a skeleton costume with a black cape, top hat, and white gloves, flanked on all sides by similarly dressed students acting as bodyguards. However, Oxford's Dooley differs from his more modern and lively counterpart at the Atlanta campus. Because Oxford was his original home, Dooley's appearances there tries to symbolize his advanced age, with characteristics such as a crouched stance, slow walk, and his signature bent crane topped with a brown skull. Additionally, his habit of making public appearances at Oxford by emerging out of a coffin differ from the conventions of his counterpart at the Atlanta campus. Dooley was first mentioned in an 1899 article printed in the school newspaper, Phoenix, titled \\"Reflections of a Skeleton\\". The article was purportedly written by a skeleton in a science lab who complained of his dull and silent existence observing the comings and goings of the students. In 1901, the Dooley mythology resurfaced, this time in a second editorial where he claims to have been the son of a wealthy Virginia planter who fought in the Revolutionary War and later died from alcohol abuse. In 1941, Dooley began appearing physically on campus, starting the tradition known as \\"Dooley's Week\\", when he has free rein to let students out of classes. Today, Dooley makes frequent appearances at social functions and other Oxford events, where he passes a message for a designated student to read to the student body. These messages relate to events on campus, ranging from critical rebukes of misdeeds, to praise for individual student accomplishments. =Animals= Students at Oxford used to steal local farm animals such as roosters and coax them into classrooms as pranks. In the 1930s to 1950s, students began bringing larger farm animals such as goats and cows up to the upper floors of Seney Hall. The tradition culminated in 2008 when a group of unidentified students led a local zebra to the third floor of Seney and barricaded the windows, doors, and elevator. Athletics alt=An old black and white photograph of eighteen male student members dressed in football gear Although President Warren Candler was strongly against intercollegiate sports programs, he started Emory's first intramural sports program in 1897. Over the rest of his term, students started intramural football, baseball, and gymnastic teams. For most its history, Emory did not have an athletic mascot. In 1960, The Emory Wheel sports editor thought it was time to adopt a mascot, but the student body was not interested. Frustrated, he arbitrarily adopted the eagle as the mascot because \\"the name [was] simply applicable and [had] obvious decorative advantages\\". Soon after, Oxford also adopted the eagle as its mascot. Today, Oxford's athletic teams are members of the Georgia Junior College Athletic Association and the National Junior College Athletic Association. Oxford College sponsors men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, and men's and women's golf. The men's tennis team won back-to-back NJCAA III National Championships in 2006 and 2007 and a third in 2009, and the women's tennis team won National Championships in 2011. The women's soccer team reached the national finals in 2006. Notable alumni * Alben W.

In popular culture Oxford College and its facilities have served as sets for several movies and television shows. It is featured in the first episode of the television series The Dukes of Hazzard, when General Lee jumps eighty-one feet in front of Seney Hall. This scene remained in the opening credits for the rest of the series. This stunt was recreated by MTV for its series Your Movie Show in July 2005 on the release of The Dukes of Hazzard movie. In addition, the television show In the Heat of the Night also filmed some scenes on campus and in the town of Oxford. Scenes from the television show The Vampire Diaries were shot in the school's library, quad, and theater in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Thereafter, the school served as the on-location college set for the show's fictional Whitmore College. An installment of the National Lampoon's Vacation series, titled Vacation, filmed scenes on campus. Oxford College hosted the Georgia's first showing of 8, a verbatim theatre re-enactment by Dustin Lance Black, on 1 March 2012. The play chronicles the district court trial and proceedings of Perry v. Schwarzenegger. Notes Oxford is a two-year program, so the class of 2018 is also part of Emory University's class of 2020. One such difference between social clubs and fraternities or sororities is that social clubs can be co-ed.

Hegemonic stability theory In his 1973 and 1986 book The World in Depression 1929‚Äì1939 (University of California Press, 1986 [Revised and Enlarged Edition]) Kindleberger advances an idiosyncratic, internationalist view of the causes and nature of the Great Depression, that concludes that a world hegemon is necessary for a generally stable world economy. Blaming the peculiar length and depth of the Depression on the hesitancy of the US in taking over leadership of the world economy when Britain was no longer up to the role after World War I, he concludes that \\"for the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer‚Äîone stabilizer\\", by which, in the context of the interwar years at least, he means the United States. In the last chapter, \\"An Explanation of the 1929 Depression\\", Kindleberger lists the five responsibilities the US would have had to assume in order to stabilize the world economy: # maintaining a relatively open market for distress goods; # providing countercyclical, or at least stable, long-term, lending; # policing the relative stability of exchange rates; # ensuring the coordination of nations' macroeconomic policies; # acting as a lender of last resort by discounting, or otherwise providing liquidity, in a financial crisis. Kindleberger was highly skeptical of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's monetarist view of the causes of the Depression, seeing it as too narrow and perhaps dogmatic, and dismisses out of hand what he characterized as Paul Samuelson's \\"accidental\\" or \\"fortuitous\\" interpretation. The World in Depression was praised by John Kenneth Galbraith as 'the best book on the subject'.

It was recorded in a laudatory poem by Martial ‚Äî Liber Spectaculorum is the only known detailed description to survive of a gladiatorial fight. This laudatory poem was written to honor and to highlight all the events of Titus's games. Their fight marked the beginning of the celebration and concluded in a rare result.

Martial, liber de spectaculis 29: \\"As Priscus and Verus each drew out the contest and the struggle between the pair long stood equal, shouts loud and often sought discharge for the combatants. But Titus obeyed his own law (the law was that the bout go on without shield until a finger be raised). What he could do, he did, often giving dishes and presents. But an end to the even strife was found: equal they fought, equal they yielded. To both Titus sent wooden swords and to both palms. Thus valor and skill had their reward. This has happened under no prince but you, Titus: two fought and both won.\\"Bailey, D.R. Shackleton. Martial Epigrams I. Harvard University Press, 1993. Discussion The Priscus and Verus' fight occurred on the first day of the games that celebrated the opening of the Colosseum. These games consisted mainly of gladiatorial fights, animal spectacles and staged sea battles.Cancik, Hubert, Helmut Schneider, and Manfred Landfester. Brill's New Pauly Online. 2005. Brill Academic Publishers. 10 May 2007 . These games helped placate the Roman masses, and increased Titus' popularity to the end of his reign in 81 AD. Beginning during the time of Julius Caesar, colosseum entertainment tactically satisfied the Roman mobs' pent-up frustrations with their cheering of the entertainment.Brunson, Matthew. Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. 1st ed. Facts on File, 1994. Gladiatorial fights did not always end with death of a participant. A gladiator could raise a finger or surrender his weapon to the opponent to signal his willingness to concede defeat. And imposition of \\"missio\\" would require that the conceding gladiator return to continued fight training. Missio was initiated following the spirit of the attendees with a reprieve from the match ending in a death. The fighters could initiate ending of the match requesting that the match be declared a draw as supported by the crowds. Gladiatorial surrender was not common since it was held in disdain.Coleman, Kathleen. \\"Missio at Halicarnassus.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 100(2000): 487-500 Role in fiction The dramatized documentary by the BBC (2003) about the opening of games at the Colosseum featured the historical Priscus and Verus match. In the program, they were at the time both slaves having developed their skills through the gladiatorial process; Priscus from Gaul was born a slave and Verus was born free. Verus is predominantly known because of his match with Priscus.

Background He is the son of Henrique Patr√≠cio de Balsem√£o (Guarda, Guarda, 9 September 1897 ‚Äì ?) and wife (married Lisbon, 21 May 1922) Maria Adelaide van Zeller de Castro Pereira (Sintra, 11 August 1897 ‚Äì 02 March 1984). Career Being a licentiate in Law from the University of Lisbon, Pinto Balsem√£o's pre-political career was in newspaper publishing. After working as a journalist and then as an administrator of Di√°rio Popular (the People's Daily in English) from 1963 to 1971, he founded the Expresso magazine in 1973 and continued to direct it until 1980. He is one of top managers and owners of Impresa media group. Pinto Balsem√£o was Member of parliament before the revolution (1969‚Äì1973), when, together with Francisco de S√° Carneiro, Joaquim Magalh√£es Mota, Carlos Mota Pinto, Jo√£o Bosco Mota Amaral, Alberto Jo√£o Jardim, Ant√≥nio Barbosa de Melo and Ant√≥nio Marques Mendes, he helped to found the Social Democratic Party (PSD), of which he is currently member number 1. In 1975 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly, which was charged with drafting a new constitution and served as an interim legislature. Pinto Balsem√£o was chosen as a Vice- President of this body. Following the victory of the Democratic Alliance (a coalition led by the PSD) in two parliamentary elections (in 1979 and 1980), Pinto Balsem√£o held senior positions in two cabinets led by Prime Minister S√° Carneiro. When S√° Carneiro was killed in an air accident on 4 December 1980, the Social Democratic Party chose Pinto Balsem√£o to succeed him. Despite his reputation for competence, he was widely perceived as lacking S√° Carneiro's charisma. He had difficulty maintaining the level of support enjoyed by his party, which had been based to a large extent on S√° Carneiro's personal popularity. He also had to cope with friction within the Democratic Alliance, and found the Democratic and Social Centre leader, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a difficult ally. These factors contributed to his defeat in the parliamentary election of 1983. He finally retired from Parliament in 1987 though not from politics. Pinto Balsem√£o currently serves as Chairman of the European Publishers Council and as chief executive officer of Grupo Impresa in Portugal. He was the founder on 6 October 1992 of Sociedade Independente de Comunica√ß√£o (SIC), the first Portuguese private television network. He is also a member of Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, and as such has attracted some controversy. He participated in more than 30 Bilderberg- Conferences since 1981. He is also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State, elected by the Assembly of the Republic and chosen by the current President of the Republic his fellow party colleague and former president of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) An√≠bal Cavaco Silva.

Contemporary scholars believe the Idra dates to the third generation of Zoharic literature, which produced also the Tikunei haZohar, the Ra'aya Meheimna, and other Zoharic material. The main body of the Zohar, or guf ha- zohar, dates to the second generation of Zoharic material. There are actually two texts in Zoharic literature called Idra: the first being the Idra Rabba, or \\"greater Idra\\", and the second being the Idra Zuta, or \\"lesser Idra\\", with these two texts being intimately connected to each other. The story of the Idroth is as follows: * Idra Rabba (Zohar 3:127b-145a): R. Shimon bar Yohai convenes with nine other scholars, and they gather in the sacred ◊ê÷¥◊ì÷∞◊®÷∏◊ê, or threshing field, where they thresh out secrets.Vital ShG, Haqdamah 38, pp. 132-133. \\"I once traveled with my master, may his memory be blessed, to the place where Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai's disciples assembled when they held the Idra Rabba [described in portion] Naso [in the Zohar]. There on the eastern side of the road, there is a cave (lit. \\"great rock\\") in which there are two large openings. In the opening on the northern end was the place where Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, peace be upon him, sat on the occasion of the Idra.\\" Each scholar expounds various configurations of the partsufim, and three of them die in ecstasy while doing so. * Idra Zuta (Zohar 3:287b-296d): Years later, at RASHB\\"I's deathbed, the seven still-living scholars come to his deathbed, along with the whole heavenly host. He alone explains the configurations of the partsufim, so this work is more unified. RASHB\\"I wavers between this world and the next. He directed his students to celebrate his passing that day as a Yom Hillula (wedding),Zohar 3:291a as it would Messianically unite the immanent and transcendent Divine Lights of Creation. The Idra Zuta is considered the deepest teachings of the Zohar.Rectifying the State of Israel, Yitzchak Ginsburgh, Gal Einai.

It is located directly opposite Yio Chu Kang MRT station. History  Li Sun High School  In 1960, under the vision and conviction of founding father, Rev Alan S Moore Anderson, the Presbyterian Synod passed the resolution to start a God-centred institution of learning and Li Sun High School was thus founded in 1965 at Upper Serangoon Road. Li Sun High shared premises with Ming Sin Primary School and was home to 150 students. It was a Chinese-language school but switched to English in 1981 to bring it into line with Singapore's Ministry of Education policies.  Renamed as Presbyterian High School  In 1978 Li Sun High School came under the management of Bethel Presbyterian Church. In 1981 the Synod approved the name change to Presbyterian High School and the school moved to Ang Mo Kio in 1983. Before 2002, PHS occupied a small plot of land located across the road from the Yio Chu Kang MRT station, and shared a field with the neighbouring Li Hua Primary School and Ang Mo Kio North Primary School, even though PHS herself shared no affiliations with either of these. Today, the school stands on 3 hectares of land and is home to over 1,400 students and staff. The new school includes a hall that can accommodate the entire school population, well-equipped computer laboratories and IT-enabled classrooms, an Indoor Sports Stadium consisting of three levels of facilities such as a basketball court, a volleyball court and various rooms for CCAs(co-curriculum activities) such as the Drama Room, the Band Room and a Music Room for students studying the subject, as well as the National Education Stairwell and the Olive Garden. In 2007, PHS was chosen as one of the seven schools to participate in the Sino-Singapore Cultural Exchange Programme in 2007 as well as again in 2016. In the same year, the school accepted the invitation by the ASEAN-Japan Friendship Association for the 21st Century (SAJAFA-21) to participate in the Miyazaki-Singapore Friendship Exchange Programme. Redevelopment In 1997, a proposal to rebuild the school was accepted by the Management Board and the Presbyterian Synod, and in 1999 the school was granted MOE's approval for total rebuilding. In 2002 the school's redevelopment was complete, and students moved into the new buildings. A Homecoming March ceremony was held involving past and present students. The new school campus has an air- conditioned hall and a clock tower, paid for by the alumni and money raised over the years. It has a school field made from an empty plot of land nearby. The plot of land has been replaced by artificial turf. School Identity & Culture  School Crest  The crest is topped by two waves signifying the continuous growth and development of the School from its founding as Li Sun High School to the present Presbyterian High School. The dove with a stalk of olive leaves depicts the development of the spiritual and moral life in the School and guides us in our education which is represented by the Book. The cross represents faith in God. The burning bush with its motto \\"Aflame for Truth\\", which is also the motto of Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, signifies that the school is part of the community of Christians in Presbyterian Churches all over the world. The Latin phrase underneath the bush Nec tamen consumebatur refers to the story of the burning bush and the worldwide Presbyterian church. The white and blue background represents the school colours: white symbolises a quest for truth while blue stands for a pursuit of excellence. The current crest dates back to 1994.  School Discipline  PHS is designed to appeal to parents wishing their sons and daughters to benefit from a tightly structured and very strict school setting in the service of God. The rules for discipline and the code of conduct lay down rigorous behavioural standards, noting that truancy, vandalism, smoking and other serious offences are severely punished.  Affiliations  Presbyterian High School has affiliations with Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, Saint Andrew's Junior College, Ang Mo Kio Presbyterian Church and Bethel Presbyterian Church. Co-Curricular Activities Presbyterian High School has been awarded the Sustained Achievement Award for Uniformed Group for 8 years. In 2005, it was ascribed the Direct Schools Admissions (DSA) for Uniformed Group. In 2007, PHS received its first Sustained Achievement Award for Sports. It was the only school in Singapore with a second DSA through Volleyball. In the 2015 SYF, all of the Performing Arts groups attained the Distinction award, with the Symphonic Band continuing to achieve Dinstinction in the 2017 SYF.

According to them, Conrado Martinez‚Äîan architect from Santa Barbara, California‚Äîcreated a similar image (1931) to show his respect and love for Oaxaca City (Mexico), destroyed because of an earthquake. Interestingly, as happened in NY, after the earthquake, Oaxaca started a process of reorganization of the users and the uses of the space, which later, in the '90s, culminated in a radical gentrification process. The original drawing is held in the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. The song was written by Steve Karmen and its copyright was donated by him to the state. Logo Nick Walker's \\"Love Vandal\\" at 17th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan The logo consists of the capital letter I, followed by a red heart symbol (‚ù§), below which are the capital letters N and Y, set in the rounded slab serif typeface American Typewriter. In 1977, William S. Doyle, Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Commerce hired advertising agency Wells Rich Greene to develop a marketing campaign for New York State. Doyle also recruited Milton Glaser, a productive graphic designer to work on the campaign and create a design based on Wells Rich Greene's advertising campaign. Glaser's initial sketch to accompany the agency's \\"I Love New York\\" slogan was conceived in a taxi. It comprised the letter I and a heart shape followed by NY, all on the same line. As the idea developed he decided to stack the I and heart shape on a line above the NY characters, later stating that he may have been \\"subliminally\\" influenced by Robert Indiana's LOVE pop art image. Glaser expected the campaign to last only a couple months and did the work pro bono. The innovative pop-style icon became a major success and has continued to be sold for years. In the popular mind (though this was not the original intention) the logo has become closely associated with New York City, and the placement of the logo on plain white T-shirts readily sold in the city has widely circulated the appearance of the image, making it a commonly recognized symbol. Glaser's original concept sketch and presentation boards were donated by Doyle to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The image became especially prominent following the September 11 attacks on the city, which created a sense of unity among the populace. Many visitors to the city following the attacks purchased and wore the shirts bearing the I Love New York logo as a sign of their support. Glaser created a modified version to commemorate the attacks, reading \\"I Love NY More Than Ever\\", with a little black spot on the heart symbolizing the World Trade Center site. The black spot approximates the site's location on lower Manhattan Island. The poster was printed in the New York Daily News and was a fundraiser for New York charities supporting those affected by the attacks. Added text at the bottom encouraged people to \\"Be generous. Your city needs you. This poster is not for sale.\\" New York state anthem \\"I Love New York\\" was written and composed by Steve Karmen in 1977 as part of the advertising campaign. In 1980, Governor Hugh Carey declared it as New York's state anthem, although not officially enacted into law. In a move that was remarkable for Karmen, who is well known for retaining the publishing rights to his songs, he gave the rights to the song to the state for free. Imitations Actor Robin Williams wearing a T-shirt with the logo translated into Arabic as \\"I love ‚ù§ New York\\" The logo has become a pop-culture icon, inspiring imitations in every corner of the globe. Merchandise proclaiming \\"I ‚ù§ ...\\" can be found wherever tourists gather. Parodies, such as \\"I ‚ô† My Pets\\" or \\"I ‚ô£ Seals\\", have also appeared. Facetious expressions beginning \\"I heart‚Ä¶\\", are based on a literal reading of the logo (e.g., the 2004 Independent film I Heart Huckabees and the audio conglomerate iHeartMedia). New York has repeatedly attempted to uphold its trademark; by 2005, the state had filed nearly 3,000 objections against imitators, and 100 \\"trademark objections and cease-and-desist letters\\" were filed in 2012 alone. Some objections have been ruled void, such as when a court concluded in 1980 that the producers of Saturday Night Live did not infringe on the copyrights of the ‚ÄúI Love New York‚Äù campaign with its ‚ÄúI Love Sodom‚Äù skit, ruling instead that it was a parody.
