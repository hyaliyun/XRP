Irving was to stage the play repeatedly throughout his career, playing the role of Mathias for the last time the night before his death in 1905. Background The Bells is a translation by Leopold Lewis of the 1867 play Le Juif Polonais (The Polish Jew) by Erckmann-Chatrian. Le Juif Polonais was also adapted into an opera of the same name in three acts by Camille Erlanger, composed to a libretto by Henri Caïn. In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre with an engagement under the management of Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a property which Irving had found for himself. Bateman had been looking for a leading man when he saw Irving in a play, and the two discussed terms and possible roles for Irving, including a new version of The Polish Jew, a play about a man haunted by a murder he has committed. The Lyceum Theatre season opened in September 1871, and the first two plays were box office failures. By late October Bateman was facing financial ruin. Again Irving urged him to stage The Polish Jew, convinced that the play would be a dramatic and financial success. An unsuccessful version of the play was running at the Royal Alfred Theatre in Marylebone to meagre audiences, which failed to convince Bateman that another version could be a success; but Irving persuaded him and gave him a copy of The Bells, by Leopold Lewis. The opening night of The Bells on 25 November 1871 was held before a small audience, and during the performance a woman fainted in the stalls.Irving, Laurence Henry Irving: the Actor and His World Faber & Faber, London (1951) pg 198 The audience sat in stunned silence at the end of the play.Jones-Evans, Eric (editor), Henry Irving and the Bells: Irving's Personal Script of the Play Manchester University Press (1980) pg 6 However, they then gave the play, and Irving's performance, a great ovation. Henry Irving as Mathias in The Bells George R Sims later wrote for The Evening News: > \\"... There were plenty of stalls vacant at the Lyceum, and the author and I > sat in two of them... The first part of The Bells was not very > enthusiastically received, but the audience was undoubtedly held by the big > scene. In the stalls there was a general agreement that Henry Irving had > fulfilled the promise of dramatic intensity which he had shown in his > recitation of The Dream of Eugene Aram. > > The play left the first-nighters a little dazed. Old fashioned playgoers > did not know what to make of it as a form of entertainment. But when the > final curtain fell the audience, after a gasp or two, realised that they had > witnessed the most masterly form of tragic acting that the British stage had > seen for many a long day, and there was a storm of cheers. Then, still pale, > still haggard, still haunted, as it were, by the terror he had so perfectly > counterfeited, the actor came forward with the sort of smile that did not > destroy the character of the Burgomaster or dispel the illusion of the > stage.\\" The critics declared Irving a new star, and he was immediately established at the forefront of British drama. The play ran for 150 nights, which was an unusually long run at the time. It would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. Edward Gordon Craig, who saw Irving perform the play 30 times, described Irving's performance as \\"the finest point the craft of acting could reach\\".Benedict Nightingale, 'Great Moments in Theatre' The Times 11 March 2011 (pg 15) Craig added, > \\"The thing Irving set out to do was to show us the sorrow which slowly and > remorselessly beat him down. The sorrow, which he suffers, must appeal to > our hearts. Irving set out to wring our hearts, not to give a clever > exhibition of antics such as a murderer would be likely to go through. Here > is a strong human being who, through a moment of weakness, falls into error > and for two hours becomes a criminal - does what he knows he is doing - acts > deliberately but acts automatically, as though impelled by an immense force, > against which no resistance is possible.\\" The overture and incidental music for The Bells was originally composed by Etienne Singla, Chef d'orchestre of the Théâtre Cluny in Paris for the opera Le Juif Polonais in 1869. H. L. Bateman brought Singla to the Lyceum to arrange his score for The Bells, and, according to the programme, Singla conducted on the opening night. In future productions Irving deleted many of the musical themes in order to heighten the drama in various scenes. As they drove home from the opening night of The Bells, Irving's wife, Florence, criticised his profession: \\"Are you going on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?\\" (She was then pregnant with their second son, Laurence). Irving got out from their carriage at Hyde Park Corner, walked off into the night and chose never to see her again.Irving, Laurence Henry Irving : The Actor and His World Faber & Faber (1951) pg 200 Original cast Caricature of Irving in The Bells.

Over time Mathias goes insane with guilt, and begins to hallucinate the ghost of the Polish Jew. Only the murderer and the audience, but nobody on stage, could hear the bells on the Jew's sledge jingling or see his ghostly face. Finally, Mathias dreams that he is on trial for the murder and, confessing his guilt, is condemned to death by hanging. Waking, he tries to pull the imaginary noose from around his neck, and dies of a heart attack. Productions Henry Irving produced the play regularly throughout his career. Other actors who have played the Burgomaster Mathias in subsequent productions include Irving's son H. B. Irving, Henry Baynton, William Haviland, Bransby Williams and John Martin- Harvey.

It is located east-southeast of Hughes, Alaska. The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air and Space Operations Center, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. It is one of fifteen Long Range Radar Sites within Alaska maintained and operated by ARCTEC, a subsidiary of Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. History Indian Mountain AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. It was one of the 10 original AC&W; surveillance stations constructed as part of the establishment of a permanent air defense system in Alaska during the early 1950s. Construction of the station, began in September 1950 and was completed in November 1953. The Army Corps of Engineers undertook the project. The location of the station made construction a challenge. Military engineer construction personnel were used to build a 9.1 mile road to the top of the mountain where the radars were located (upper camp) and a base station and airstrip (lower camp). The lower camp , located at the confluence of the Indian River and Utopia Creek, included a runway opened in May 1952 with a 12-percent slope, the steepest remote site runway. The upper camp, at the summit of Indian Mountain (elevation 4,234 feet), could be reached by the road. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The station buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The airstrip was adjacent to the station, a 4,100' gravel/dirt airstrip capable for medium transport (C-119, C-123, C-130) aircraft to fly in supplies, equipment, mail and personnel. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The inaccessibility made the personnel at the site responsible for maintenance if anything went wrong. Water mains occasionally froze and ruptured. The 708th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq), activated in November 1953, provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Murphy Dome AFS near Fairbanks, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Radars operated at the station were an AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20, AN/FPS-6, and an AN/PS-6B. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command (AAC), after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Indian Mountain site was located near the top camp radars and was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm.(Peymann) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Indian Mountain AFS received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 708th AC&W; Sq was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Indian Mountain LRR Site was transferred to Pacific Air Forces' (PACAF)Eleventh Air Force with the redesignation of AAC. In 1998 PACAF initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Current status Today very little of the former Indian Mountain Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by PACAF's 611th Air and Space Operations Center, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is generally unattended; a few civilian contractors that access the site by former support airstrip, now the Indian Mountain LRRS Airport and provide maintenance and support when needed to maintain the radar system. *Site is continuously attended by contractors to maintain the runway, power station, roads, buildings, radar and facilities.

Early life Fr Adolph J. Paschang was born in Martinsburg, Audrain County, Missouri. He grew up on a farm there, studied at Campion College of the Sacred Heart (1916) (later Campion High School), then at St. Louis University High School in St. Louis, then at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis. He joined the newly founded Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, commonly known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, and was ordained a priest on 21 May 1921. After being ordained a priest, Paschang was immediately sent off to Kongmoon (now known as Jiangmen) China. Ministries Fr Adolph J. Paschang preached and worked in southern China, covering Gaozhou, previously known as Kochow. Fr Paschang worked in the Sacred Heart School in Gaozhou, Maoming, the second school ever founded by the Maryknollers in China, by Fr Bernard F. Meyer with inauguration held on 5 October 1923. and first graduation on 1926 August 30. He also worked at Yangjiang (previously known as Yeungkong), Jiaying (previously known as Kaying) Taishan (previously known as Toishan) and Jiangmen. He was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Kongmoon on 17 June 1937, consecrated Bishop on 30 November 1937, and later appointed Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Jiangmen (previously known as Kongmoon) on 11 April 1946. He lived through the Japanese invasion and occupation of China in the Second World War. =Second World War= Japan invaded China in phases in the 1930s, gradually taking southern China towards the end of the decade. Until the attack on Pearl Harbor of 1941, Paschang and his diocese were relatively undisturbed by Japanese forces, given that he possessed American citizenship. In February 1941, Fr Paschang received a pass from the Japanese occupation forces to visit Hong Kong. The real purpose for his move was to leapfrog over into the unoccupied areas of his Diocese of Jiangmen in order to visit the priests and sisters. During his stay in Hong Kong, Fr Joe Sweeney from the Gate of Heaven Leprosarium in Ngaimen arrived, and recounted the adventurous journey he had just made: the motor launch carrying Fr Big Joe and other passengers had been attacked by a Japanese patrol boat towards evening, but they escaped capture as darkness descended and allowed them to slip unsighted past the patrol boat. Bishop Paschang would have to take the same route and the same risks on his return visitations. While Bishop Paschang was in Hong Kong, he performed the ordinations at the Dominican Rosary Hill chapel, in the absence of Bishop Enrico Valtorta. In May 1946, Bishop Paschang arrived at Maryknoll Stanley House in Hong Kong for a conference with more than a dozen Ordinaries of South China, including the four Ordinaries of Maryknoll. He arrived with a van dyke beard – only his Episcopal rank saved him from the customary Stanley practice of insisting on the removal of beards. =Early years of Communist Rule= After the liberation of Mainland China he chose to stay behind. He was captured and torturedPownall Reeves, John (2014). The Lone Flag: Memoir of the British Consul in Macau during World War II. Hong Kong University Press. p. 190. . by the Chinese Communist authorities. *On 5 December 1951, Paschang was forced to contact Stanley House in Hong Kong on three times to relay information that the Chinese Communists were demanding US$22,000. *On 7 December 1951, the ransom price was reduced to US$6,000, but nothing was paid. *On 19 December 1951, similar news was reported in The New York Times: “December 18 An official Roman Catholic spokesman said today that a 56-year-old Bishop, the Most Rev. Adolph Paschang of Kongmoon (now called Jiangmen), Kwangtung Province (now named Guangdong Province), had been beaten again there following the church's refusal to pay \\"ransom money\\" to the Chinese Communists as a means of saving him from the violence of the intensified \\"land reform\\" in that southeastern coastal province.”. *Bishop Paschang was subsequently severely tortured and broken as a person. =Release by the Communist into Hong Kong= Fr. William Downs in his Maryknoll Hong Kong Chronicle recorded on 9 June 1952, “Bishop Paschang, after (being) very badly treated ... was finally expelled from China”. They marched Bishop Paschang “from his mission at Pakkai” (now called Beijie, where the Immaculate Heart of Mary Cathedral, i.e. cathedral of the Diocese of Jiangmen, was located), “placed him on a junk and sailed off – he did not know his destination and the thought of Father Sandy Cairns’ unhappy ending at the hands of the Japanese must have crossed his mind\\". ( available from the University of Hong Kong Library, but for in-library reading only) *On 6 June 1952 Friday night, Paschang crossed the Chinese border into Portuguese Macao. *On 9 June 1952 Mondayand finally reached Hong Kong. Many reporters anxiously awaited him at the Hong Kong Pier. Upon arrival, Bishop Adolph Paschang recalled that he had been made to kneel on broken bricks in the winter of 1951, in a third-degree procedure, but he had no hatred at all. After a long interview, Fr Paschang could finally return to the Stanley House for a very late dinner. Later life After his expulsion by the Communist Chinese government, Bishop Paschang stayed in the Maryknoll Stanley House, headquarters of the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers in Hong Kong, visited the States briefly, but again returned to Hong Kong out of his love of the Chinese people. *In March 1957, Bishop Paschang suffered a severe cerebral thrombosis, and was hospitalized. He was thereafter no longer able to walk. The Canossian Sisters’ St. Francis Hospital in Wan Chai became his home for the best part of a year. *In October 1957, Paschang insisted on leaving the hospital, and returned to Maryknoll Stanley House. Arrangements were made after a meeting with the visiting Superior General, Father John Comber, and a storeroom on the ground floor next to the kitchen was transformed into a “suite” for him. He was in the tender, if non-professional, care of faithful houseboy Ah Fung. *In May 1958, he was finally constrained to use a wheelchair. Despite his delibilities, he continued to attend Mass regularly and assist in church services as far as his ailing body allowed. * On 3 February 1968, Bishop Paschang died in St. Paul's Hospital in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Memorial In memory of Paschang, when a new primary school was founded by the Maryknollers in Ngau Tau Kok, Kowloon, in 1969, it was named Bishop Paschang Memorial School, which is now known as Bishop Paschang Catholic School. In the late 1990s, the Hong Kong SAR Government planned to re-develop the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate, where Bishop Paschang Memorial School was situated. In 1997, the headmaster at that time, Leung Kwok Hung, applied for a new school premises from the government and was given a new school building in a \\"school village\\" in Kowloon Bay. AM section of Bishop Paschang Memorial School moved to the new campus in Kowloon Bay in 2002. The new school was named Bishop Paschang Catholic School. The school building of Bishop Paschang Memorial School was finally handed back to the government of Hong Kong in 2008, in line with the plan of demolishing the then remaining portion of the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate. The remaining classes of the PM section of Bishop Paschang Memorial School were relocated to Bishop Paschang Catholic School in Kowloon Bay as well.

The organization was formed by social activists such as Ahn Changho, Shin Chaeho, Park Eunsik, and Lim Chi Jung. With their belief that the enlightenment can strengthen the national power of Korea to achieve independence, they took in actions on military movement, education, publication, and industrialization. Even after the New People's Association had been dissolved by Governor-General of Korea in 1911, they made a huge contribution to the Korean Independence Movement.Ahn Chang-ho  Background  After the Independence Club (독립협회, 獨立協會) was dissolved on December 25, 1898 as Emperor Gojong officially announced a prohibition on congresses held by people, the Empire of Japan made a treaty with the Korean Empire called the Eulsa Treaty which made the Korean Empire become a protectorate of the Empire of Japan.The history of Korea, pp.461~462, by Homer Hulbert The treaty laid the foundation for the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1907 and subsequent annexation of Korea in 1910.Carnegie Endowment (1921). Even though Emperor Sunjong, who is a son of Emperor Gojong, sent a Hague Secret Emissary Affair to expose the unfairness of the treaty in the Hague Convention of 1907, due to the Great Powers, they were ignored.Eckert, Carter J. et al. (1990). Korea Old and New: A History, p. 245.  History  From the initiation by Ahn Changho in Los Angeles, California, the people who used to be the leaders of the Independence Club decided to organize Korean New People's Association (대한신민회) from Pyeongyang and Seoul in the late 1906. After the establishment, they established branches nationwide, and started to support education, industrialization, and military actions for independence. However, in 1911, the New People's Association was dissolved. Even though they were dismissed, their ideology and main actions were inherited by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea later.  Ideology  Yun Chi-ho The main political ideology of the New People's Association was based on ideals of Democracy and Republicanism, which is far different from the Constitutional Monarchy in which the Independence Club had believed. Also, to strengthen national power, they asserted that citizens should be reformed to become new people (신민, 新民) first. In other words, they believed people should be 'prepared' first for the opportunity of Korean independence.  Actions  = Military School of the New Rising = The New People's Association had supported the Righteous Army movement (militias in Korea) to restore the power of the nation. They established the Military School of the New Rising, which made a huge contribution to the foundation of the Korean Liberation Army (한국 광복군), Korean Independence Army (대한독립군), Korean Revolutionary Army (조선혁명군), and Righteous Patriots Corps (의열단) from 1911 to 1920. = Education = As they believed that the enlightenment is one of the most crucial factors to strengthen national power, the New People's Association also made a huge investment in education in Korea. It is assumed that some hundreds of middle schools were established by the New People's Association.http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=101739 = Publication = The New People's Association also published the Daehan Maeil Sinbo (Korean Daily News, 대한매일신보) At the same time, Sonyeon (Boys, 소년) was published as a monthly magazine for students, and all these publication activities provided a basis of the modern culture of Korea.

Amadeo's theatre was founded in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1797 and lasted until 1834. It was the first continuously operating theatre in Zagreb. Overview Amadeo’s theatre was named after Anton Amade de Varkony, Hungarian count and notable county prefect of Zagreb. Amadeo’s theatre was situated in the former Blatna (Mud) and Kazališna (Theatre) Street, which afterwards got the name Demetrova. The building in which it was situated is the present location of the Croatian Natural History Museum and, from 2000, the home of the Amadeo Theatre and Music Company.http://www1.zagreb.hr/galerijakd.nsf/c31dd4a135787898c1256f9600325af4/734a6a13f4dea561c1257f3e00490a3c?OpenDocument Amadeo’s theatre was a public theatre which was rented by its owner to a contractor – the principal of the theatrical group with the highest offer. Posters, tickets, announcements and advertisements were printed for plays and other events. The earliest preserved poster, dated January 1799, advertised a comic opera by Giovanni Paisiello. After the death of Amade de Varkony in January 1835, his son sold the building, and theatre life in Zagreb moved to the then newly built Stanković's theatre in St. Mark's Square. Repertoire The plays in Amadeo's theatre were performed almost exclusively in the German language. In 1832 and 1833 German actors in Amadeo’s theatre performed the first public and professional plays in the Croatian Kajkavian dialect. Dragutin Rakovac (1813–1854) translated two comedies by Kotzebue to Kajkavian, and Josef Schweigert, director and actor of a German group who was performing at the theatre at the time, portrayed the following plays: * 2 October 1832 Ztari mladosenja i kosharice (by Kotzebue) * 28 January 1833 Vkanjeni Vkanitel (by Florijan) * 23 July 1833 Ztari zaszebni kuchish Petra III (by Kotzebue) A collective German language repertoire with standard features of the Austrian province of the time was portrayed in Amadeo's theatre: dramas, operas, ballets and a special kind of uncomplicated plays with singing sections which later developed into an operetta called Singspiel. At the beginning of the 19th century, the occurrence of writers pertaining to the Vienna circle, who marked the beginning of the Vienna folk theatre with their works, is becoming more and more frequent, and without them it would be impossible to imagine the genesis of the Croatian folk play. In the Croatian theatrical history, Amadeo’s theatre had a primarily educational role.

The company manufactures and supplies vacuum and abatement equipment used in advanced manufacturing processes. As of January 2014, Edwards is a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Copco Group. History Edwards equipment and services business was founded by physicist, F.D. Edwards in 1919 in south London. Initially the business imported vacuum equipment before commencing independent manufacturing in 1939. In 1953 the company relocated its factory and headquarters to Crawley and was later acquired by The BOC Group in 1968. This move prompted international expansion for the business, particularly across Asia. Manufacturing operations continued to expand in the UK with a concentration of design and manufacturing facilities in the Sussex towns of Crawley, Eastbourne, Shoreham and Burgess Hill. From the mid 1990s a programme of outsourcing manufacturing to lower cost economies began, resulting in the eventual closure of all the Edwards facilities in Crawley and Shoreham with Burgess Hill becoming a headquarters and design centre. In 1997 BOC Edwards was formed with the integration of Edwards vacuum business with BOC electronic gases unit before the BOC Group was itself acquired by Linde AG in 2006. Edwards subsequently became independent when it was acquired by CCMP Capital & Unitas Capital in 2007. On 14 May 2012, Edwards became listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as a publicly traded company. In late February 2013 it was announced that Matthew Taylor would be standing down as CEO and was being replaced by independent Board of Directors member Jim Gentilcore effective 1 March 2013. On 19 August 2013 it was announced that Edwards had been wholly acquired by Atlas Copco Compressors, becoming the Vacuum Solutions division of Atlas Copco. and Geert Follens was appointed Divisional president. The acquisition was completed in January 2014.

Birmingham. A confidence trickster convinces a small Irish town that a statue ought to be erected to one of its natives who is claimed to have led the independence movement of a South American country, closely modelled on Bernardo O'Higgins. It premiered at the Apollo Theatre in London on 8 January 1913 where it had a long run. Its American premiere was at the Hudson Theatre in New York on 13 November 1913. It received good reviews from critics, and was commercially successful. When it was first staged at Westport, Ireland it provoked a riot as the crowd objected to the depiction of what they felt was a mocking representation of their town (where the writer served as an Anglican clergyman). Adaptations The play has been adapted to film several times. In 1921 a silent version General John Regan was made.

Anything suffering from Av HaTumah (\\"Father of uncleanness\\"), such as carrion, the blood of a menstruate woman, seminal fluid, etc., can render those persons who touch it defiled at a further remove, known as a \\"first-grade level of uncleanness.\\" A person or object that is a Av HaTumah has the ability to transfer its tumah to another person or object, such as clothing (usually at a downgraded level of tumah), while they, in turn, have the ability to transfer their tumah to both foods and drink (in the case of foods, at a downgraded level, but in the case of drinks, at the very same level). There are two types of Av HaTumah, the first being one textually listed in the Torah (D'Oraita), such as the carcass of any of the eight creeping things named in Leviticus 11:29-30, or a seminal issue (Leviticus 15), inter alia; the second being one of rabbinic origin (D'Rabbanan), such as a grave area that had been ploughed, or any foreign land, or a dead human's bone the size of a barleycorn, among other things.Mishnah (Kelim 1:1 [p. 604 in Danby's edition])  Torah source   Examples  An Av HaTumah is generally a person or object that is listed in the Torah.

FCC was a 1998 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case involving the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the Fifth Amendment. The FCC claimed that the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod had violated the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity requirements by not hiring enough minorities/women and by requiring a knowledge of Lutheran doctrine in order to be hired to work at its two FM and AM radio stations located in Clayton, Missouri. History The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod first began broadcasting religious content on the radio in 1924 on KFUO, which is a daytime non-profit AM station located on the Concordia Seminary campus grounds in Clayton, Missouri. KFUO was founded by Richard Kretzschmar, John Fritz and Dr. Walter A. Maier. It is the nation's longest running religious radio station. They later added a full-time commercial broadcast station in 1948, still with a religious focus, KFUO-FM. According to the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the stations \\"have been dedicated to the task of carrying out in their way the Great Commission which Christ gave to His Church, to preach the Gospel to every creature and to nurture and serve the people in a variety of ways.\\" Background In May 1978 the FCC adopted its Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979. This policy outlined two elements of a minority ownership policy: *1) The Commission pledged to consider minority ownership as one factor in comparative proceedings for new licenses. In comparing mutually exclusive applications for new radio or television broadcast stations, it looked first at six factors, but under the new policy, it must consider minority ownership and participation in management as a \\"plus\\" to be weighed together with the other six factors. *2) The FCC outlined a plan to increase minority opportunities to receive reassigned and transferred licenses through the \\"distress sale\\" policy. This policy would allow a broadcaster whose license had been designated for a revocation hearing, or whose renewal application had been designated for hearing, to assign the license to an FCC- approved minority enterprise. Congress and the FCC selected these minority ownership policies to promote program diversity, which they saw as an important governmental objective. In addition, they would serve as a constitutional basis for the preference policies. The FCC adopted these policies in an attempt to satisfy its obligation under the Communications Act of 1934 to promote diversification of programming. It argued that its past efforts to promote diversification in the broadcast industry had been insufficient, and detrimental to not only the minority audience, but also the listening and viewing public as a whole. =Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC= In the case of Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC (1990) the constitutionality of the two elements of the FCC's Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities from 1978 came under scrutiny. Metro Broadcasting, Inc., sought review of an FCC licensing decision. Rainbow Broadcasting had been given a new television license over Metro because of the FCC's policy on minority ownership; Rainbow Broadcasting was minority owned. Metro Broadcasting claimed that the FCC was violating its equal protection right under the Fifth Amendment in its comparative decision to award Rainbow Broadcasting the license. Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court held : \\"The FCC policies do not violate equal protection, since they bear the imprimatur of longstanding congressional support and direction and are substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of broadcast diversity.\\" Both the Commissioner and Judge concurred that in regards to the Congress' racial classification policies, they need not be subject to \\"strict scrutiny\\". Also, a precedent case, City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., held that, \\"Benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress -- even if those measures are not \\"remedial\\" in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination—are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\\" =FCC Equal Employment Opportunity Regulations 1994= The policy statement released on February 1, 1994 provided clear guidelines by which the Commission would determine and impose sanctions for EEO violations, which in time could create a more consistent body of EEO enforcement precedents. Under this policy a $12,500 base forfeiture (subject to change) would be imposed on license renewal applicants who fail to recruit or attract an \\"adequate\\" pool of minority and female applicants or hires for at least two thirds of all vacancies during the renewal period. However, it was noted that at the time this policy was released, the tern \\"adequate\\" was never clearly defined. The FCC stated that not only would they continue to require licensees to demonstrate that they made adequate efforts to seek minorities and women, but in addition they would be looking at results. Licensees unable to prove that these efforts produced a significant number of minority applicants or interviews would be at greater risk for repercussions. = Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña = In the case of Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña (1995) The United States Supreme Court overturned Metro Broadcasting, Inc v. FCC in which the Court had stated that Congress' benign minority ownership policies need not be subject to strict scrutiny. The case held that racial classifications imposed by the federal government would be analyzed under a standard of \\"strict scrutiny\\". =FCC Equal Employment Opportunity Regulations 1997= The FCC adopted its Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations in 1997, imposing two basic requirements for radio stations. Radio stations are prohibited from discriminating in employment against anyone based on their race, color, religion, national origin, or sex Also, radio stations are required to implement an affirmative action program in order to hire more women and minorities. This EEO program must include a plan for the following: *Disseminating the equal opportunity program to job applicants and employees *Using minority and women-specific recruiting sources *Evaluating the station's employment profile and job turnover against the availability of minorities and women in its recruitment area *Offering promotions to minorities and women in a nondiscriminatory fashion *Analyzing its efforts to recruit, hire, and promote minorities and women. Initial charge The initial charge brought against the Lutheran Church radio stations was initiated by a Hearing Designation Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing for Forfeiture to examine the church's or licensee's compliance with the FCC's equal employment opportunity requirements. The denomination's membership was around 2 percent African American, and because of this, the NAACP challenged the stations' license renewal with the FCC. The Commission questioned the licensee's affirmative recruitment efforts, noting its reasons for failing to recruit had a direct adverse impact on the recruitment of African Americans. In addition to requiring \\"Lutheran training\\", a \\"classical music expertise\\" was required by the church; however, these requirements were suspect because not all persons hired for specified positions at the two stations had said training or expertise. The FCC also found that the Church had made misleading statements about these practices when they claimed to actively seek female and minority referrals to fill vacancies as they occurred. An FCC Administrative Law Judge found the Church's overall affirmative action efforts unsatisfactory during much of its license term, and held that these deficiencies were sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of EEO misrepresentation, but not severe enough to warrant license non-renewal. The Judge, however, did impose an initial forfeiture of $50,000 for the willful and repeated violation of the FCC's EEO minority recruiting requirements. The Church, upon appeal to the Commission, argued that the implication that it did not comply with the Commission's EEO requirements violated its constitutional right to religious freedom by improperly evaluating its recruitment efforts and employment criteria. However, the Court of Appeals had held in the past, that the enforcement of the Commission's EEO rules do not violate a licensee's constitutional rights. The Commission, the Administrative Law Judge, and the Review Board agreed that the Church's recruitment efforts were deficient but because only one of the violations fell within the three-year statute of limitations in effect at that time, the amount of the forfeiture was reduced to $25,000, the maximum fine permitted for a single violation of the Commission's rules. Ruling On April 14, 1998 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity program requirements unconstitutional. The judge presiding over the case, Laurence Silberman, offered an explanation for the court's decision, stating that the FCC based its case on preventing workplace discrimination and promoting diversity of programming. However, the court found that the FCC does not have the authority to declare regulations using an anti-discrimination rationale. This is because the purpose of the FCC is to safeguard the public interest. The court had previously stated that agencies can impose anti- discrimination regulations only when they specifically relate to that agency's statutory charge. Therefore, it holds that the instances in which the FCC has the authority to pass anti-discriminatory measures would be one in which the discrimination in question related to \\"communication services\\" - which, in this case, means programming. Another explanation offered by Silberman is that the phrase \\"diversity of programming\\" is incredibly vague and any further attempts to identify what that means would put it in conflict with the First Amendment. Therefore, such a concept is not meaningful. Response The FCC, the NAACP, and several high-profile civil right leaders voiced strong opposition to the decision, such as in this quote by FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristanion. The FCC initially petitioned the District of Columbia District Court for an en banc rehearing of the case with a full court. In a 6-4 vote, the majority of the D.C. Circuit denied the joint petitions for rehearing, and the FCC eventually accepted the rulings. The Lutheran Church celebrated the decision as a victory for freedom of religious expression. Critics of affirmative action or equal opportunity policies also applauded the decision and subsequent loosening of EEO regulations, claiming \\"The narrowing of affirmative action is not so much the destruction of a time-honored legal mechanism, but rather a return to the original purpose of the policy.\\" Implications This case was one of many that indicated a shift in stance for the federal judiciary, which previously showed deference to the FCC when creating and enforcing EEO and affirmative action policies. As a result, other EEO or affirmative action policies, whether already in place or in the process of being developed, are under a higher level of scrutiny. As a direct response to the case, the FCC proposed several new EEO rules that would require broadcast licensees to inform women and members of minority groups of job vacancies, and to have an opportunity to apply for openings at broadcast stations. The proposed rules would not contain requirements or quotas for employers to meet regarding the makeup of their workforce relative to the composition of the local labor force, and the FCC would not use such comparisons when assessing those types of EEO programs. The case also caused effects in other forms of media when the FCC proposed modifications to its EEO rules for cable and MVPD entities in order to maintain consistency.

The story One of the earliest appearances of the story is in the 12th century, when it was included in Marie de France's rhymed fables, the Ysopet, under the title \\"The man who had a contrary wife\\" (tale 96).1000 Mediaeval Jokes on Google Books Its most concise telling is in Poggio Bracciolini's Facetiae (1450), where it is titled \\"The man who searched in the river for his dead wife\\": :A man, whose wife had drowned in a stream, went up the river against the current to look for the body. A peasant who saw him marvelled greatly at this, and advised him to follow the flow of the current. \\"In that case\\", returned the first, \\"I should never find her, for when she was alive she was always difficult and contrary and went against the ways of others, so I am sure now that she is dead, she will go against the current of the stream.\\"Different translations number the stories differently; in Edward Storer's it is tale 62 Gustave Doré's print of La Fontaine's fable, 1880 The language that Poggio uses is Latin, but there is an English retelling in the early Tudor Merry Tales and Quick Answers (c.1530)Of hym that sought his wyfe against the streme, Tale 55 and another in Geoffrey Whitney's Choice of Emblemes (1586).Uxor morosa, etiam discors, page 158 In Italy there had been the elegant Latin verses of Gabriele Faerno's influential Centum Fabulae (1554)Uxor submersa et vir, Fable 41 and the Italian rhyming version by Giovanni Maria Verdizotti (1570).100 Favole Morali Fable 53 But the most influential telling of all was in La Fontaine's Fables as \\"The drowned wife\\" (La femme noyée, III.16).An English translation In this he deprecates the anti-feminist trend of the story but uses it as an illustration of how a governing nature persists throughout life 'and even beyond, perhaps'. La Fontaine begins his account by protesting that he is not among those who use the contemporary French idiom, 'it's nothing, just a woman drowning', referring to those who lazily subscribed to such societal attitudes. At the end he echoes Faerno's conclusion that a person's nature does not change. Poggio's jest book and the English 'Merry Tales', on the other hand, avoid drawing a moral and end on the popular idiom of 'swimming against the current', used of just such characters as the contrary wife is said to be.

Personal life Støylen was born in Sande in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway on 17 February 1858. He was the son of farmer and fisherman Andreas Olsen Støylen and Margrete Helgesdatter Bringsvor. He was married in Bergen in 1890 to Kamilla Karoline Heiberg. His son was Kaare Støylen, a future bishop, and his brother- in-law was Georg Sverdrup, the Norwegian-American theologian. He died in Bærum, Norway in 1937. Sculpture of Bernt Støylen Career Støylen graduated from a teaching school in Volda in 1875. After some time as a teacher, he took his examen artium in 1879. He then went on to study theology at the University of Oslo, receiving his Cand.theol. degree in 1885. He began his career as a curate in the Johannes Church parish in Bergen from 1887-1890. After that, he served as a priest of the Norwegian Church Abroad at Cardiff in Wales in the United Kingdom. He worked there from 1890 until 1895. After returning to Norway, he was hired to teach at a new seminary in Notodden from 1895-1902. After that, starting in 1902, he taught at the Theological Seminary at the University of Oslo, first as a teacher, and in 1909 he was named a professor. In 1914, Støylen was appointed to be the bishop of the Diocese of Kristiansand. In 1925, when he was Bishop of Kristiansand, the government approved the division of the diocese with all of Rogaland county breaking off from the diocese to form the new Diocese of Stavanger. Støylen continued on as bishop of the newly-renamed Diocese of Agder until his retirement in 1930. Selected works He published a series of readers for primary school, Lesebok for folkeskulen, from 1908 to 1911. In 1925, he was co-editor of the hymnal Nynorsk salmebok together with Peter Hognestad and Anders Hovden. This hymnal was written in the Nynorsk written language, one of the two main written forms of Norwegian.

Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, (TEI), is the transmission of epigenetic markers from one organism to the next (i.e., parent–child transmission) that affects the traits of offspring without alteration of the primary structure of DNA (i.e. the sequence of nucleotides) —in other words, epigenetically. The less precise term \\"epigenetic inheritance\\" may cover both cell–cell and organism–organism information transfer. Although these two levels of epigenetic inheritance are equivalent in unicellular organisms, they may have distinct mechanisms and evolutionary distinctions in multicellular organisms. The environment can induce the epigenetic marks (epigenetic tags) for some epigenetically influenced traits, and some marks are heritable, leading some to view epigenetics as a relaxation of biology's rejection of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism). Epigenetic categories Four general categories of epigenetic modification are known:Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis # self-sustaining metabolic loops, in which a mRNA or protein product of a gene stimulates transcription of the gene; e.g. Wor1 gene in Candida albicans # structural templating in which structures are replicated using a template or scaffold structure on the parent; e.g. the orientation and architecture of cytoskeletal structures, cilia and flagella, prions, proteins that replicate by changing the structure of normal proteins to match their own # chromatin marks, in which methyl or acetyl groups bind to DNA nucleotides or histones thereby altering gene expression patterns; e.g. Lcyc gene in Linaria vulgaris described below # RNA silencing, in which small RNA strands interfere (RNAi) with the transcription of DNA or translation of mRNA; known only from a few studies, mostly in Caenorhabditis elegans Inheritance of epigenetic marks Epigenetic variation typically takes one of four general forms, though there are other forms that have yet to be elucidated. Currently, self-sustaining feedback loops, spatial templating, chromatin marking, and RNA-mediated pathways modify epigenes of individual cells. Epigenetic variation within multicellular organisms is either endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous is generated by cell–cell signaling (e.g. during cell differentiation early in development), while exogenous is a cellular response to environmental cues. =Removal vs. retention= In sexually reproducing organisms, much of the epigenetic modification within cells is reset during meiosis (e.g. marks at the FLC locus controlling plant vernalization), though some epigenetic responses have been shown to be conserved (e.g. transposon methylation in plants). Differential inheritance of epigenetic marks due to underlying maternal or paternal biases in removal or retention mechanisms may lead to the assignment of epigenetic causation to some parent of origin effects in animals and plants. =Reprogramming= In mammals, epigenetic marks are erased during two phases of the life cycle. Firstly just after fertilization and secondly, in the developing primordial germ cells, the precursors to future gametes. During fertilization the male and female gametes join in different cell cycle states and with different configuration of the genome. The epigenetic marks of the male are rapidly diluted. First, the protamines associated with male DNA are replaced with histones from the female's cytoplasm, most of which are acetylated due to either higher abundance of acetylated histones in the female's cytoplasm or through preferential binding of the male DNA to acetylated histones. Second, male DNA is systematically demethylated in many organisms, possibly through 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. However, some epigenetic marks, particularly maternal DNA methylation, can escape this reprogramming; leading to parental imprinting. In the primordial germ cells (PGC) there is a more extensive erasure of epigenetic information. However, some rare sites can also evade erasure of DNA methylation. If epigenetic marks evade erasure during both zygotic and PGC reprogramming events, this could enable transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Recognition of the importance of epigenetic programming to the establishment and fixation of cell line identity during early embryogenesis has recently stimulated interest in artificial removal of epigenetic programming. Epigenetic manipulations may allow for restoration of totipotency in stem cells or cells more generally, thus generalizing regenerative medicine. =Retention= Cellular mechanisms may allow for co- transmission of some epigenetic marks. During replication, DNA polymerases working on the leading and lagging strands are coupled by the DNA processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which has also been implicated in patterning and strand crosstalk that allows for copy fidelity of epigenetic marks. Work on histone modification copy fidelity has remained in the model phase, but early efforts suggest that modifications of new histones are patterned on those of the old histones and that new and old histones randomly assort between the two daughter DNA strands. With respect to transfer to the next generation, many marks are removed as described above. Emerging studies are finding patterns of epigenetic conservation across generations. For instance, centromeric satellites resist demethylation. The mechanism responsible for this conservation is not known, though some evidence suggests that methylation of histones may contribute. Dysregulation of the promoter methylation timing associated with gene expression dysregulation in the embryo was also identified. =Decay= Whereas the mutation rate in a given 100-base gene may be 10−7 per generation, epigenes may \\"mutate\\" several times per generation or may be fixed for many generations. This raises the question: do changes in epigene frequencies constitute evolution? Rapidly decaying epigenetic effects on phenotypes (i.e. lasting less than three generations) may explain some of the residual variation in phenotypes after genotype and environment are accounted for. However, distinguishing these short-term effects from the effects of the maternal environment on early ontogeny remains a challenge. Contribution to phenotypes The relative importance of genetic and epigenetic inheritance is subject to debate. Though hundreds of examples of epigenetic modification of phenotypes have been published, few studies have been conducted outside of the laboratory setting. Therefore, the interactions of genes and epigenes with the environment cannot be inferred despite the central role of environment in natural selection. Experimental methodologies for manipulating epigenetic mechanisms are nascent (e.g.) and will need rigorous demonstration before studies explicitly testing the relative contributions of genotype, environment, and epigenotype are feasible. =In plants= b1 paramutation in maize. The B' allele converts the B-I allele to a B'-like state after interaction in F1 heterozygotes. These converted alleles gain the ability to convert naive B-I alleles in subsequent generations resulting in all progeny displaying lightly pigmented phenotype. Studies concerning transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants have been reported as early as the 1950s. One of the earliest and best characterized examples of this is b1 paramutation in maize. The b1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is involved in the anthocyanin production pathway. When the b1 gene is expressed, the plant accumulates anthocyanin within its tissues, leading to a purple coloration of those tissues. The B-I allele (for B-Intense) has high expression of b1 resulting in the dark pigmentation of the sheath and husk tissues while the B' (pronounced B-prime) allele has low expression of b1 resulting in low pigmentation in those tissues. When homozygous B-I parents are crossed to homozygous B', the resultant F1 offspring all display low pigmentation which is due to gene silencing of b1. Unexpectedly, when F1 plants are self-crossed, the resultant F2 generation all display low pigmentation and have low levels of b1 expression. Furthermore, when any F2 plant (including those that are genetically homozygous for B-I) are crossed to homozygous B-I, the offspring will all display low pigmentation and expression of b1. The lack of darkly pigmented individuals in the F2 progeny is an example of non-Mendelian inheritance and further research has suggested that the B-I allele is converted to B' via epigenetic mechanisms. The B' and B-I alleles are considered to be epialleles because they are identical at the DNA sequence level but differ in the level of DNA methylation, siRNA production, and chromosomal interactions within the nucleus. Additionally, plants defective in components of the RNA-directed DNA-methylation pathway show an increased expression of b1 in B' individuals similar to that of B-I, however, once these components are restored, the plant reverts to the low expression state. Although spontaneous conversion from B-I to B' has been observed, a reversion from B' to B-I (green to purple) has never been observed over 50 years and thousands of plants in both greenhouse and field experiments. Examples of environmentally induced transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants has also been reported. In one case, rice plants that were exposed to drought- simulation treatments displayed increased tolerance to drought after 11 generations of exposure and propagation by single-seed descent as compared to non-drought treated plants. Differences in drought tolerance was linked to directional changes in DNA-methylation levels throughout the genome, suggesting that stress-induced heritable changes in DNA-methylation patterns may be important in adaptation to recurring stresses. In another study, plants that were exposed to moderate caterpillar herbivory over multiple generations displayed increased resistance to herbivory in subsequent generations (as measured by caterpillar dry mass) compared to plants lacking herbivore pressure. This increase in herbivore resistance persisted after a generation of growth without any herbivore exposure suggesting that the response was transmitted across generations. The report concluded that components of the RNA-directed DNA-methylation pathway are involved in the increased resistance across generations. =In humans= A number of studies suggest the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans. These include those of the Dutch famine of 1944–45, wherein the offspring born during the famine were smaller than those born the year before the famine and the effects could last for two generations. Moreover, these offspring were found to have an increased risk of glucose intolerance in adulthood. Differential DNA methylation has been found in adult female offspring who had been exposed to famine in utero, but it is unknown whether these differences are present in their germline. It is hypothesized that inhibiting the PIM3 gene may have caused slower metabolism in later generations, but causation has not been proven, only correlation. The phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Dutch Hunger Winter Syndrome. Another study hypothesizes epigenetic changes on the Y chromosome to explain differences in lifespan among the male descendants of prisoners of war in the American Civil War. The Överkalix study noted sex-specific effects; a greater body mass index (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters, of fathers who began smoking early. The paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons and not granddaughters. The paternal grandmother's food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality risk ratio. When the grandmother had a good food supply was associated with a twofold higher mortality (RR). This transgenerational inheritance was observed with exposure during the slow growth period (SGP). The SGP is the time before the start of puberty, when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body. The ancestors' SGP in this study was set between the ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls. This occurred in the SGP of both grandparents, or during the gestation period/infant life of the grandmothers, but not during either grandparent's puberty. The father's poor food supply and the mother's good food supply were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death. The loss of genetic expression which results in Prader–Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome has in some cases been found to be caused by epigenetic changes (or \\"epimutations\\") on both the alleles, rather than involving any genetic mutation. In all 19 informative cases, the epimutations that, together with physiological imprinting and therefore silencing of the other allele, were causing these syndromes were localized on a chromosome with a specific parental and grandparental origin. Specifically, the paternally derived chromosome carried an abnormal maternal mark at the SNURF-SNRPN, and this abnormal mark was inherited from the paternal grandmother. Similarly, epimutations on the MLH1 gene has been found in two individuals with a phenotype of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and without any frank MLH1 mutation which otherwise causes the disease. The same epimutations were also found on the spermatozoa of one of the individuals, indicating the potential to be transmitted to offspring. In addition to epimutations of the MLH1 gene, it has been determined that certain cancers, such as breast cancer, can originate during the fetal stages within the uterus. Furthermore, evidence collected in various studies utilizing model systems (i.e. animals) have found that exposure during parental generations can result in multigenerational and transgenerational inheritance of breast cancer. More recently, studies have discovered a connection between the adaptation of male germinal cells via pre- conception paternal diets and the regulation of breast cancer in developing offspring. More specifically, studies have begun to uncover new data that underscores a relationship between transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of breast cancer and ancestral alimentary components or associated markers, such as birth weight. da Cruz, R.

Frontiers in nutrition, 7, 93. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2020.0009 A study has shown childhood abuse (defined in this study as \\"sexual contact, severe physical abuse and/or severe neglect\\") leads to epigenetic modifications of glucocorticoid receptor expression which play a role in HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) activity. Animal experiments have shown that epigenetic changes depend on mother-infant interactions after birth. In a recent study investigating correlations among maternal stress in pregnancy and methylation in teenagers and their mothers, it has been found that children of women who were abused during pregnancy were significantly more likely than others to have methylated glucocorticoid- receptor genes, which in turn change the response to stress, leading to a higher susceptibility to anxiety. Additional studies examining the effects of diethylstilbestrol (DES), which is an endocrine disruptor, has found that the grandchildren (third-generation) of women exposed to DES significantly increased the probability of their grandchildren developing attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Kioumourtzoglou M, Coull BA, O’Reilly ÉJ, Ascherio A, Weisskopf MG. Association of Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol During Pregnancy With Multigenerational Neurodevelopmental Deficits. JAMA Pediatr. 2018;172(7):670–677. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.0727 This is because women exposed to endocrine disruptors, such as DES, during gestation may be linked to multigenerational neurodevelopmental deficits. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that endocrine disruptors have a profound impact on germline cells and neurodevelopment. The cause of DES's multigenerational impact is postulated to be the result of biological processes associated with epigenetic reprogramming of the germline, though this has yet to be determined. Effects on fitness Epigenetic inheritance may only affect fitness if it predictably alters a trait under selection. Evidence has been forwarded that environmental stimuli are important agents in the alteration of epigenes. Ironically, Darwinian evolution may act on these neo-Lamarckian acquired characteristics as well as the cellular mechanisms producing them (e.g. methyltransferase genes). Epigenetic inheritance may confer a fitness benefit to organisms that deal with environmental changes at intermediate timescales. Short-cycling changes are likely to have DNA-encoded regulatory processes, as the probability of the offspring needing to respond to changes multiple times during their lifespans is high. On the other end, natural selection will act on populations experiencing changes on longer-cycling environmental changes. In these cases, if epigenetic priming of the next generation is deleterious to fitness over most of the interval (e.g. misinformation about the environment), these genotypes and epigenotypes will be lost. For intermediate time cycles, the probability of the offspring encountering a similar environment is sufficiently high without substantial selective pressure on individuals lacking a genetic architecture capable of responding to the environment. Naturally, the absolute lengths of short, intermediate, and long environmental cycles will depend on the trait, the length of epigenetic memory, and the generation time of the organism. Much of the interpretation of epigenetic fitness effects centers on the hypothesis that epigenes are important contributors to phenotypes, which remains to be resolved. =Deleterious effects= Inherited epigenetic marks may be important for regulating important components of fitness. In plants, for instance, the Lcyc gene in Linaria vulgaris controls the symmetry of the flower. Linnaeus first described radially symmetric mutants, which arise when Lcyc is heavily methylated. Given the importance of floral shape to pollinators, methylation of Lcyc homologues (e.g. CYCLOIDEA) may have deleterious effects on plant fitness. In animals, numerous studies have shown that inherited epigenetic marks can increase susceptibility to disease. Transgenerational epigenetic influences are also suggested to contribute to disease, especially cancer, in humans. Tumor methylation patterns in gene promoters have been shown to correlate positively with familial history of cancer. Furthermore, methylation of the MSH2 gene is correlated with early- onset colorectal and endometrial cancers. =Putatively adaptive effects= Experimentally demethylated seeds of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana have significantly higher mortality, stunted growth, delayed flowering, and lower fruit set, indicating that epigenes may increase fitness. Furthermore, environmentally induced epigenetic responses to stress have been shown to be inherited and positively correlated with fitness. In animals, communal nesting changes mouse behavior increasing parental care regimesCurley, JP, FA Champagne, and P Bateson (2007) Communal nesting induces alternative emotional, social and maternal behavior in offspring. Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology 11th Annual Meeting Pacific Grove, CA, USA. Cited in and social abilities that are hypothesized to increase offspring survival and access to resources (such as food and mates), respectively. Macroevolutionary patterns Inherited epigenetic effects on phenotypes have been documented in bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Though no systematic study of epigenetic inheritance has been conducted (most focus on model organisms), there is preliminary evidence that this mode of inheritance is more important in plants than in animals. The early differentiation of animal germlines is likely to preclude epigenetic marking occurring later in development, while in plants and fungi somatic cells may be incorporated into the germ line. Life history patterns may also contribute to the occurrence of epigenetic inheritance. Sessile organisms, those with low dispersal capability, and those with simple behavior may benefit most from conveying information to their offspring via epigenetic pathways. Geographic patterns may also emerge, where highly variable and highly conserved environments might host fewer species with important epigenetic inheritance. Controversies Humans have long recognized that traits of the parents are often seen in offspring. This insight led to the practical application of selective breeding of plants and animals, but did not address the central question of inheritance: how are these traits conserved between generations, and what causes variation? Several positions have been held in the history of evolutionary thought. =Blending vs. particulate inheritance= Blending inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin pointed out, makes evolution by natural selection impossible. Addressing these related questions, scientists during the time of the Enlightenment largely argued for the blending hypothesis, in which parental traits were homogenized in the offspring much like buckets of different colored paint being mixed together. Critics of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, pointed out that under this scheme of inheritance, variation would quickly be swamped by the majority phenotype. In the paint bucket analogy, this would be seen by mixing two colors together and then mixing the resulting color with only one of the parent colors 20 times; the rare variant color would quickly fade. Unknown to most of the European scientific community, a monk by the name of Gregor Mendel had resolved the question of how traits are conserved between generations through breeding experiments with pea plants. Charles Darwin thus did not know of Mendel's proposed \\"particulate inheritance\\" in which traits were not blended but passed to offspring in discrete units that we now call genes. Darwin came to reject the blending hypothesis even though his ideas and Mendel's were not unified until the 1930s, a period referred to as the modern synthesis. =Inheritance of innate vs. acquired characteristics= In his 1809 book, Philosophie Zoologique, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck recognized that each species experiences a unique set of challenges due to its form and environment. Thus, he proposed that the characters used most often would accumulate a \\"nervous fluid.\\" Such acquired accumulations would then be transmitted to the individual's offspring. In modern terms, a nervous fluid transmitted to offspring would be a form of epigenetic inheritance. Lamarckism, as this body of thought became known, was the standard explanation for change in species over time when Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace co-proposed a theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859. Responding to Darwin and Wallace's theory, a revised neo-Lamarckism attracted a small following of biologists, though the Lamarckian zeal was quenched in large part due to Weismann's famous experiment in which he cut off the tails of mice over several successive generations without having any effect on tail length. Thus the emergent consensus that acquired characteristics could not be inherited became canon. =Revision of evolutionary theory= Non-genetic variation and inheritance, however, proved to be quite common. Concurrent with the 20th-century development of the modern evolutionary synthesis (unifying Mendelian genetics and natural selection), C. H. Waddington (1905-1975) was working to unify developmental biology and genetics. In so doing, he adopted the word \\"epigenetic\\"{{oed  epigenetic to represent the ordered differentiation of embryonic cells into functionally distinct cell types despite having identical primary structure of their DNA. Researchers discussed Waddington's epigenetics sporadically - it became more of a catch-all for puzzling non-genetic heritable characters rather than a concept advancing the body of inquiry. Consequently, the definition of Waddington's word has itself evolved, broadening beyond the subset of developmentally signaled, inherited cell specialization. Some scientists have questioned whether epigenetic inheritance compromises the foundation of the modern synthesis. Outlining the central dogma of molecular biology, Francis Crick succinctly stated, \\"DNA is held in a configuration by histone[s] so that it can act as a passive template for the simultaneous synthesis of RNA and protein[s]. None of the detailed 'information' is in the histone.\\" However, he closes the article stating, \\"this scheme explains the majority of the present experimental results!\\" Indeed, the emergence of epigenetic inheritance (in addition to advances in the study of evolutionary-development, phenotypic plasticity, evolvability, and systems biology) has strained the current framework of the modern evolutionary synthesis, and prompted the re- examination of previously dismissed evolutionary mechanisms. There has been much critical discussion of mainstream evolutionary theory by Edward J Steele, Robyn A Lindley and colleagues, Fred Hoyle and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe, Yongsheng Liu Denis Noble, John Mattick and others that the logical inconsistencies as well as Lamarckian Inheritance effects involving direct DNA modifications, as well as the just described indirect, viz. epigenetic, transmissions, challenge conventional thinking in evolutionary biology and adjacent fields.

Magalios is a multi- disciplinary visual artist who makes works in fields such as painting, photography, sculpture, and performance art. Magalios is an unusual artist because of his use of unique names and identities for each body of work: George Magalioshttp://georgemagalios.net (The Fall Line painting series), Georges Ducharmehttp://georgesducharme.net (sculpture and installation art), Will Swinburne (performance art), Giorgio Fati (photography), and Jorge Griegohttp://jorgegriego.net (Energy Plan for the Florida Man painting series). Magalios bases all of his work and thought on the ground palette, a concept and form he has developed from his research into pre-historic cave painting. The ground palette is both a philosophical foundation and an aesthetic way of thinking that attempts to distill language and ideas down to their essences. In articles and various websites, Magalios lists his influences as Led Zeppelin, Willie Mays, Tim Tebow and his parents, Virginia and Elias Magalios. He has exhibited in exhibitions in New York,http://newyork.field-of-vision.net/raw/pages/George%20Magalios%2001.html Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and other cities across North America as well as in Athenshttp://whitneystolich.com/fournos.htm and across Europe and continues his practice today in West Palm Beach, Florida. George Anastasios Magalios writes art theoretical works and art reviews of contemporary and modern art issues. He is a student of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jean Baudrillard and he incorporates much of the ideas of these thinkers in both his art and his writings. He has presented papers and the College Art Association conference in New Yorkhttp://conference.collegeart.org/sessions2007/sessions2007.html (2007) and at the Subtle Technologies Conference in Toronto (2002). In addition to Montreal, Magalios has lived in Paris, San Francisco, New York, and Pittsburgh. Though he has lived in the United States for most of his life, the artist considers himself a Montrealer, albeit an exiled one. Sometimes referring to himself as a \\"Site-Specific Philosopher\\", Magalios is known for his attempt to fuse an aesthetic practice with a personal one based on virtue, truth, and beauty.  Montreal, 1967–1974  Magalios was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. When Magalios was six years-old in 1973 he built a cave out of a mountain of snow in his backyard. This experience is considered by the artist to be a formative one and he has since called the work \\"Snow Womb\\" and has listed it in various biographies and lists of exhibitions. The artist remembers Montreal winters as being wombs of white and cold comforted by his mother's cooking and his visits to various Greek relatives. Raised in a Greek household, the artist grew up to speak English, Greek, and French and the cosmopolitan cultural environment proved to be a major influence on the artist's political and cultural outlook.  West Palm Beach, 1974–1986  When Magalios was 7 years-old his family moved to West Palm Beach, Florida. The shift from rich and colorful Montreal to provincial South Florida proved to be a dramatic one. The artist's father signed him up for little league baseball as a way to get initiated into American culture and this game would prove to be a formative experience in his relationship to the United States. Around the age of 8 Magalios's mother had him take painting lessons for the first time. The artist was told by the teacher, an established painter of portraits, that he should \\"stick to baseball\\" since his art skills were \\"limited at best\\". The artist first remembers painting a clown portrait based on a magazine photo. During his youth, the artist developed a reputation for pranks and athletic prowess on the baseball diamond. Around the age of 12 the artist is said to have begun a serious study of the music of Led Zeppelin, a band Magalios often lists as an influence on his work to this day. Soon after George A. Magalios discovered the work of Vincent Van Gogh when his mother bought him his first art book, a retrospective of the painter's work that the artist is said to still own and refer to for inspiration today. At Cardinal Newman High School Magalios hovered between athlete and artist and developed a reputation that defied easy classification because of his ability to hit a fastball 400 feet and appreciate the nuances of The Smiths, The Church, R.E.M. and Echo and the Bunnymen.  Gainesville, 1986–1989  Upon graduating from high school Magalios attended the University of Florida where he began to study political theory and art history. It was during this time in Gainesville that he began to paint more seriously as he undertook a series of oils on canvas depicting the chromatic tendencies of the human face as it responded to various emotional stimuli. It is believed that only three of these paintings are extant. It was at the University of Florida where Magalios first developed a reputation as a developing painter and ardent defender of the sublime in art.  Montreal, 1989–1992  In 1988, while still at the University of Florida, Magalios decided to move back to his native Montreal and take a year-long break from studies. Arriving in 1989 Magalios began a series of black and white semi-figurative paintings on masonite panels and ink drawings on paper. None of the paintings are believed to be still in existence as the artist has never mentioned them in any of his lists of works. In 1990, Magalios painted the first, of what would continue to be his most important series of Autumn- themed paintings. The work was a red-orange series of \\"leaves\\" on multiple 2x4 studs of wood that were individually screwed into a wall to become both a sculptural and painterly work. In 1991 Magalios began site-specific installations that consisted of assemblages of street trash from his Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood. The assemblages would take the form of traditional Hindu Siva-Sakti lingam sculptures. This return to sculpture was inspired, in part, by a sense of existential homecoming the artist felt after living away from Montreal for 15 years. It was during the same year that the artist returned to complete his bachelor's degree at Concordia University. While there he was introduced to the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean Baudrillard, two thinkers who would play a strong role in forming Magalios's vision of the world that combined a penchant for a critical approach to perception and politics with an affirmation of the light and darkness of living.  San Francisco, 1992–1997  In 1992 Magalios moved to San Francisco and was instantly influenced by the dramatic landscapes of the Pacific Coast and the Sierra Nevada, as well as by the atmosphere of kindness, friendship, and creativity in the Bay area. During this period he devoted himself almost exclusively to a series of guerilla site-specific installation works in both rural and urban settings. The works were often ephemeral in nature and largely influenced by artists such as Richard Long and Andy Goldsworthy. He also continued experimenting with a series of paintings on cardboard and canvas that explored a minimal use of painterly brush strokes in the earth colors of the ground palette. In 1993 George Magalios enrolled in the Master's program of the Interdisciplinary Humanities Department at San Francisco State University. He would write his thesis on the views of art and technology held by Joseph Beuys and Martin Heidegger. The thesis, entitled \\"Site-Specific Philosophy\\", was an attempt to craft a philosophical way of thinking and living using the paradigms of installation-based sculpture. The thesis was well received and continues to be a foundation for much of the artist's writings.  New York, 1997–1998  After receiving his master's degree Magalios moved to New York in 1998 to pursue a PhD in cultural theory at the New School for Social Research. He dropped out during the first day of classes after experiencing an epiphany on the streets of Greenwich Village. The vision was one of a life of art-making instead of a life of teaching and writing about art. It would prove to be a life-altering moment that allowed Magalios to fully embrace the art practice fully as a way of life rather than a way of theory. New York would also prove to be an important home for George Magalios as he often mentions the importance of seeing so many important exhibitions and works by his heroes first hand. The Robert Rauschenberg retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in 1997 and the Matisse collection at the Museum of Modern art are two examples frequently cited as poignant discoveries.  Pittsburgh, 1998–2005  In 1998 George A. Magalios began studies in the MFA program at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Art, upon a recommendation from Arthur Kroker, a former professor at Concordia University. While at Carnegie Mellon he met Bill Kofmehl and began a series of performance and installation works that explored concepts such as hunting, nature, and technology's influence on perception. It was in Pittsburgh where the artist further refined The Fall Line series of paintings and completed a separate, yet related, group of works called \\"Ground Palette Details\\", that were pictorial riffs of the ground palette form. The time in Pittsburgh was filled with wild experimentation for George Magalios. It included forays into video art, digital media, and stand-up comedy.

Afterward, he engaged in anti-war activism. Background Upon turning 18, Rader registered for the draft, and received his draft card from the Selective Service System. He entered Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, as an undergraduate student of political science. His status as a college student deferred his being drafted into the military. Upon leaving college, in mid-1965 he was re- classified as 1A: available for unrestricted military duty. He signed up for the U.S. Army Reserve, then trained for the Army Special Forces, commonly known as the Green Berets. Of this elite formation, Rader said, \\"I wanted to see what the best was like.\\" Reading Ramparts magazine in February 1966, he was struck by an article, \\"The whole thing was a lie!\\", from ex-Green Beret Master Sergeant Donald Duncan who turned down a field commission to the rank of captain and left the Army. Duncan wrote that a majority of South Vietnamese citizens were in favor of North Vietnamese politics, or against Saigon politics, or both. After realizing this, Duncan said he \\"had to accept also that the position, 'We are in Vietnam because we are in sympathy with the aspirations and desires of the Vietnamese people,' was a lie.\\" Duncan did not think the U.S. should be a part of Vietnam's political disputes, and he opined that \\"anti-communism is a lousy substitute for democracy.\\" He wrote that the U.S. should get out of Vietnam and let them decide their own fate, even though he felt that a united Vietnam would not be better off \\"under Ho's brand of communism.\\" Rader went on active duty in September 1966 and was sent to Fort Bragg in North Carolina; the home of the regular Army Special Forces. Rader said that he spoke to Green Beret soldiers returning from Vietnam and that they reported similar experiences to Duncan's. The responses these soldiers gave were ones Rader classified as belonging primarily to two groups: one group saying they were following orders and the other group saying the Vietnamese did not know what was best for them, that they needed to be \\"trained\\". A much smaller group said that the war was wrong and that they would refuse to go back. Rader finished active duty in mid-January 1967 \\"thoroughly disgusted with the Army\\". Before his active Army Reserve assignment, Rader had been developing with Kenneth Janda at Northwestern a computerized notification system. In January 1967 the two men's work was published as a report on \\"a computerized system for automatically notifying social scientists of new journal articles\\", ones in their area of interest. Draft-card burning Frustrated with his Army experiences in February and March, on April 14, 1967, Rader heard about a large anti-war protest which was to take place the next day in New York City. He contacted the leader of the student protesters coming from Cornell University and said he would join them. At Sheep Meadow, Central Park, wearing his Green Beret uniform covered by a black ski jacket, he assembled with the group of draft card burners and their friends. At around 11:30 am after 60 men began burning their cards, he removed his jacket, placed his beret on his head \\"at the correct angle\\", and burned his draft card. A large number of people were attending or watching this rally, including anti-war activist Abbie Hoffman, New York City policemen, FBI men, newsreel cameramen, reporters, photographers and passers-by. Time magazine estimated 75 total cards burnt; however, participant Martin Jezer wrote that there were about 158 in all. On April 17, he wrote a letter of resignation to his company commander. The 23-year-old Rader was arrested by FBI agents several days later at his home in Evanston. He was held in a Chicago prison cell overnight and released on bail the next day. Penalties he faced included up to five years in prison, up to $10,000 fine, and an additional six-months in jail for wearing his uniform without approval. Of the Sheep Meadow draft-card burners, only Rader was charged with the federal crime. Most of the others, according to Jezer who burned his own card at the rally, were visited by FBI agents but not charged. Rader was arraigned on April 28; seven men burned their draft cards at his arraignment. In May 1967 in response to the Sheep Meadow demonstration, 56-year-old anarchist intellectual Paul Goodman published a piece in The New York Review of Books sympathetic to draft-card burning. The editors printed a handful of responses, including one from Rader who described his motivation for the act. Writing five months after being arrested, he expected that it was not likely that he would be tried for burning his draft card: \\"the Army does not like to court- martial in the glare of publicity.\\" Chicago draft resistance Rader determined that he would devote his time to working against the draft and against U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. For Liberation magazine he wrote about his plans: \\"We are no longer interested in merely protesting the war; we are out to stop it.\\" In September 1967 with anti-war activist David F. Greenberg, he founded Chicago Area Draft Resisters (CADRE), an organization with links to the national protest movement. In association with the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe), Rader helped organize the \\"March on the Pentagon\\" held on October 21, 1967. For this rally, Rader worked with Abbie Hoffman, David Dellinger, Jerry Rubin, William Francis Pepper, Carl Davidson of Students for a Democratic Society, Professor Robert Greenblatt of The Mobe, Lincoln Lynch of the Congress of Racial Equality, and Amy Swerdlow of Women Strike for Peace (WSP). Rader stood up and spoke at the March on the Pentagon; Norman Mailer described the speech he gave as being \\"thought by many to be the best hour of them all.\\" Rader was arrested and put in jail with other protesters. There, he took part in a hunger strike, and was fed intravenously by prison personnel. Rader wrote letters and made public appearances in support of CADRE. In December 1967, he took part in an interview which was broadcast on WAMU, the second part of a series on the Vietnam War; the first part's interview subject had been General William Westmoreland. He wrote a letter seeking funds for CADRE from readers of The Movement, a publication of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He wrote to WSP to ask for bail donations and legal defense resources, urging the women to \\"get behind this fine group of young idealists, working not for themselves, but for the future of the race.\\" CADRE printed original articles as well as reprints of other articles, and made the literature available to young people in the Chicago metropolitan area. CADRE raised funds to bail out any imprisoned for draft resistance, and established a pool of lawyers willing to take such cases. Rader moved to New York in February 1968 but he continued to work for the cause of war resistance. CADRE helped organize Chicago area activities for March 1968 including a week of protest and a day of civil disobedience. During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, CADRE was present at protests outside of the convention. The organization faded after 1973 when President Richard Nixon abolished the draft, and by 1974 or '75, CADRE ceased operation. Rader's CADRE partner Greenberg had been a member of The Mobe, and in 1967 he wrote a monograph for CADRE: Vietnam and the draft. Later he earned a Ph.D. in high-energy physics, then became interested in crime and society. Greenberg is currently a sociology professor at New York University and has published several books. After Rader committed suicide in a Boston psychiatric hospital in November 1973, Greenberg dedicated his 1993 book to him as well as to German Green Party founder Petra Kelly who died in 1992 and prisoner rights activist Fay Stender who died in 1980.

Between 1797 and 1834, that same building was the founding place of the first Croatian public theatre called Amadeo's theatre, named after its founder, the Hungarian count Anton Amade de Varkony, who was also a notable county prefect of Zagreb.Batusic, Nikola History of the Croatian Theatre. Skolska knjiga, 1978. In the period between 2006 and 2009, the company was placed in the Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb. In the summer of 2010, it relocated back to the atrium of the Croatian Natural History Museum. Amadeo Theatre and Music Company is the only polyvalent summer scene in Zagreb with its program going on from July until September. Overall, during one summer there are about 50 plays, concerts and film events with the participation of renowned Croatian and foreign artists. Programme The programme of Amadeo Theatre and Music Company consists of a musical and a theatrical part. In the musical part, Amadeo houses classical music concerts, with great emphasis on the participation of young talented musicians, jazz, world music and popular music. In the theatrical part, there are premieres and re-runs of chamber plays, ballet, monodrama and stand-up comedy. Besides the main program, Amadeo Theatre and Music Company runs theatrical program for pre-school and primary school children called 'Little Amadeo', and the alternative stage dedicated to unconventional and amateur art forms called 'Amadeoff Festival'.  Other programs  In the seasons from 2002 until 2005, 12 works of Croatian contemporary composers have been premiered. In the seasons of 2001 and 2007 Amadeo has displayed a range of movies from the Motovun Film Festival. From the season of 2006 up until today, Amadeo arranges performances of works by Croatian composers presented by chamber bands and orchestras. From the season of 2007 up until today, Amadeo has been cooperating with the Jewish Community of Zagreb within the program of the Israel week. In the season of 2010, Amadeo has displayed a range of movies from the Pula Film Festival.  Projects  Situated in the historic site of the Croatian Natural History Museum, Amadeo Theatre and Music Company has given a number of contributions to its revitalization. In 2001, on the facade of the building of the Croatian Natural History Museum in Zagreb, Amadeo Theatre and Music Company revealed a memorial with a historic bilingual name from the beginning of the 19th century: Kazaliscna Vulicza – Theater Gasse (Theatre Street). In 2003, Amadeo Theatre and Music Company refurbishes the derelict atrium of the Croatian Natural History Museum guided by the idea of the museum adviser Jakov Radovcic. The “Kamenopisna karta Hrvatske” (a map of Croatia made out of stone tiles) dominates in the newly refurbished atrium. The map is made out of 2500 stone tiles of Croatian stone, collected in situ from all over Croatia, and the atrium itself is covered in characteristic Croatian stone. There is also a unique geological pillar in the atrium, floor and side illumination by the idea of maestro Ivo Pogorelic.  Programme board  The founders of the Amadeo Theatre and Music Company are: Nenad Jandric, Rada Vnuk, Zvonimir Zoricic, Bozidar Oreskovic (1942–2010), Neven Franges and August Faulend Heferer.

It is now integrated as line 32 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn.  Route  Unteröwisheim station The Kraich Valley Railway runs from Bruchsal in the Kraichgau. Its name is derived from the Kraichbach stream, whose course it follows from Ubstadt to Gochsheim, as well as the town of Kraichtal, to which all the settlements on the line belong apart from Bruchsal and Ubstadt. It lies entirely within the district of Karlsruhe. Because the railway line largely follows the aforementioned river valley there are no large structures like tunnels or noteworthy bridges. History =Planning and opening of the line= During the time up to 1874 when the city of Bruchsal became a railway hub, the municipalities along the Kraichbach were interested in obtaining a connection to the railway. Therefore, Bruchsal sought a railway in the Kraichbach valley through the towns of Ubstadt, Unteröwisheim, Oberöwisheim, Münzesheim and Gochsheim to Eppingen. However, the opening of the Kraichgau Railway on the Karlsruhe–Bretten–Eppingen route in 1879 delayed the construction of such a line. In 1888, Bruchsal took the initiative in 1888 to build, along with the municipalities in the Kraichbach and the Katzbach valleys, a narrow gauge branch line with two branches, separating in Ubstadt. The northern line would run through Odenheim to Elsenz and the southern branch up the Kraichbach valley to Gochsheim. Originally planned to run only as far as Gochsheim, it was finally decided to extend the line out of the Kraichbach valley to Menzingen. At the same time, it was also decided that the line would be built at standard gauge. On 5 March 1896, the Kraich Valley Railway was opened together with the Katzbach Railway. The line was initially operated by the Westdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West German Railway Company, WeEG). Gochsheim station after its reconstruction as a crossing station =The years under the BLEAG (1898–1931)= In October 1898, the WeEG operations on the Katzbach and the Kraich Valley Railways were transferred to its subsidiary, the Badische Lokal-Eisenbahnen Aktiengesellschaft (Baden Local Railway Company, BLEAG). In the first years of operations, there was a high level of passenger traffic and some growth in freight traffic. The Kraich Valley and the Katzbach Railways were the two most profitable lines operated by BLEAG in the early years of the twentieth century. After the First World War, both lines were caught in a crisis because BLEAG had run out of funds for the maintenance of its lines. After the district of Karlsruhe agreed to contribute to the funding of various BLEAG routes, the lines were temporarily saved. In subsequent years, normal operations were restored. In 1931, BLEAG had to file for bankruptcy during the Great Depression. =The years under the DEBG (1931–1963)= Bahnbrücken station In the wake of the bankruptcy, both of the BLEAG lines in the Kraich Valley and the Katzbach were taken over by the German Railway Operating Company (Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebs-Gesellschaft, DEBG) on 1 January 1932. DEBG managed to restore operations on the two lines. It also procured a diesel railcar, which was mainly used on the Kraich Valley Railway, since the most distant part of the Katzbach Railway between Odenheim and Hilsbach were too steep for this vehicle. The outbreak of the Second World War meant that the passenger numbers increased significantly since private transport was restricted due to the war. Because of the fighting, however, operations had to be closed on 2 April 1945. Unlike the experience of many other rail lines, war damage on the two lines was limited. This allowed operations on the Kraich Valley Railway to be resumed on 7 June 1945. The steam locomotives and passenger carriages on the line, which were up to fifty years old, were gradually replaced by diesel haulage from the mid-1950s. Thus, in 1955, DEBG operated a diesel locomotive and, in 1956, six diesel railcar formerly owned by Deutsche Bundesbahn and built in 1936 and 1937. However, the DEBG applied on 7 July 1958 to close all of its tracks in southern Germany. This was resisted by the state of Baden-Württemberg, in particular. =The years under the SWEG (1963–1994)= DEBG transferred, with effect from 1 May 1963, both lines to the Südwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (Southwest German Railway Company, SWEG), which had been founded on 10 December 1962 by the state of Baden-Württemberg to preserve a number of private lines before they were closed. The SWEG sought to modernise the line. Thus, the remaining steam trains were replaced by diesel locomotives after the takeover. It also introduced improvements to the line, which also shortened the travel time significantly. As a result, a trip from Bruchsal to Menzingen took only 37 minutes compared to 47 minutes previously. Menzingen station In 1980, several new factories were established in Gochsheim, which led to a marked increase in freight traffic on the Kraich Valley Railway. The SWEG even had to buy a diesel locomotive to serve this market in 1982. From October 1981, services were reinforced on the Kraich Valley Railway by class NE 81 diesel multiple units, which had been built by Waggon Union. However, the modernisation of the line by the SWEG did not increase traffic on the line. In the 1980s, the workshop facilities in Menzingen were expanded and modernised at a cost of millions of Deutsche Marks. In the following years the Kraich Valley Railway was increasingly under threat of closure, as was the outer section of the Katzbach Railway from Odenheim to Hilsbach, which was closed in stages between 1960 and 1986. =Acquisition by the AVG and upgrade for the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn (since 1994)= AVG locomotive 462 with an Esslingen carriage In order to preserve the line from closure, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG) took over the line from the SWEG in 1994. Originally it operated the line with class NE 81 diesel multiple units that it had taken over from the SWEG or acquired from Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. Initially the AVG services was operated under the most recent timetable of the SWEG, six months later improvements were made that resulted in a regular interval timetable, which had not previously existed. As part of the founding of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV), the service on the Katzbach Railway was named line R 32. At the same time as the line was acquired by AVG, it was decided to upgrade the line to Stadtbahn standards. This included, among other things, the modernisation and electrification of the line and the construction of new stations. In March 1996, the Kraich Valley Railway and Katzbach Railway celebrated the centennial of the two lines. At this time, the Bruchsal–Ubstadt Ort section was already electrified, so Stadtbahn sets were operated between Bruchsal and Ubstadt as part of the celebrations. Unteröwisheim Martin-Luther-Str. station In September 1996, the Kraich Valley Railway was finally incorporated into the operations of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. The Karlsruhe Stadtbahn line S 3, which has operated since 1994 from Karlsruhe Central Station to Bruchsal, was extended to Menzingen at the end of the Kraich Valley Railway. In preparation, the station platforms were raised and some of the station crossing loops were extended. In addition, a total of four new stations were established at Bruchsal Schlossgarten, Bruchsal Stegwiesen, Ubstadt Salzbrunnenstr. and Unteröwisheim Martin-Luther-Str. At the opening of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn at the end of 2003, the Mannheim–Karlsruhe section of the Rhine Valley Railway was integrated into the S-Bahn network and has since been called line S 3. To avoid confusion, the former line S 3 serving the Kraich Valley Railway was renamed line S 32 at the same time. Gochsheim station was rebuilt with a crossing loop at the same time. Operations =General= Ubstadt Ort station Crossing opportunities exist in Ubstadt Ort and in the stations of Unteröwisheim, Münzesheim, Gochsheim and Menzingen, although these are rarely used in Unteröwisheim. The stations of Bruchsal, Münzesheim and Gochsheim have a platform height of 55 cm, the others are 38 cm high. Gochsheim station building was demolished around 2000 during the construction of the crossing loop at the station. The same happened at Menzingen. Only the station building of Oberöwisheim still exists and it is now used as a residence. =Timetable= Oberöwisheim station Services on the line are integrated as part of line S 32 (Menzingen–Bruchsal–Karlsruhe–Achern) of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network. It is operated at peak times at 20-minute intervals, otherwise, there are services at least hourly. Services run through Karlsruhe Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) to Baden-Baden and Achern or to Freudenstadt over the Murg Valley Railway. The trains to the Murg Valley change their line designation in Ubstadt Ort station to line S 31, since this designation covers services on the Bruchsal–Freudenstadt route, whereas the designation S 32 applies to services to Achern. It is operated by dual-system Stadtbahn vehicles of the AVG. Services running to Freudenstadt only use the AVG’s GT8-100D/2S-M vehicles (numbered 837 to 922 and allowing level access at their central doors to 55 cm high platforms), since only they are allowed to operate over the steep route between Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt. =Freight= On the Kraich Valley Railway freight traffic runs to Gochsheim. The local freight siding branches off the line about five hundred metres west of the station. Another freight siding exists at Münzesheim Ost. The siding in Unteröwisheim is now closed. Until the conversion to Stadtbahn operations, Oberöwisheim station also had a freight siding, but this has now been removed. AVG locomotive 462 near Menzingen The freight traffic is hauled by AVG diesel locomotives 462 and 464, which were built by Maschinenbau Kiel. Locomotive 462 was originally owned by the SWEG and was taken over by the AVG with its takeover of the line. During the time of the SWEG it had the number of 101 and sometimes it was also hauled passenger trains. =Buses= Along the Kraich Valley Railway there are four short bus routes connecting localities to the railway: line 135 Oberöwisheim–Neuenbürg, line 136 Münzesheim–Oberacker, line 137 Bahnbrücken station–Bahnbrücken Ort and line 138 Menzingen–Landshausen.

The CONEX box was developed during the Korean War and was used to transport and store supplies during the Korean and Vietnam war. It was reinvented by Malcom McLean to form the standard Intermodal shipping container (often called an ISO box, after ISO 6346) that is used widely by container shipping companies today. History The use of standardized steel and aluminum shipping containers began during the late 1940s and early 1950s, when commercial shipping operators and the US military started developing such units.Intermodal Marine Container Transportation: Impediments and Opportunities, Issue 236 // National Research Council: The container revolution (page 18): \\"This [Army] box in turn served as a model for the small containers that most major ship operators began using during the late 1940s and early 1950s. These however, were mainly loaded and unloaded at the docks, and not used intermodally..\\" During World War II, the US Army began experiments with containers to ship supplies to the front lines. Cargo was being delayed at ports due to the time required by break bulk loading and offloading of ships. In addition the supplies suffered from pilferage and in- transit damage. In 1948 the U.S. Army Transportation Corps developed the \\"Transporter\\", a rigid, corrugated steel container, able to carry . It was long, wide, and high, with double doors on one end, was mounted on skids, and had lifting rings on the top four corners. After proving successful in Korea, the Transporter was developed into the Container Express (CONEX) box system in late 1952. Based on the Transporter, the size and capacity of the Conex were about the same, but the system was made modular, by the addition of a smaller, half-size unit of long, wide and high.Development of Containerization // J. van Ham, J. Rijsenbrij: Steel containers (page 8) CONEXs could be stacked three high, and protected their contents from the elements. By 1965, the US military had some 100,000 CONEX boxes, and by 1967, over 100,000 more had been procured to support the escalation of the Vietnam War, making this the first worldwide application of intermodal containers. More than three quarters were shipped only once, because they remained in theatre. The CONEX boxes were as useful to the soldiers as their contents, in particular as storage facilities where there were no other options. The term \\"CONEX\\" remains in common use in the US military to refer to the similar but larger ISO-standard shipping containers.

In 1960 services between Tiefenbach and Hilsbach were withdrawn, in 1975 the section between Odenheim Ost and Tiefenbach followed and, in 1986, the 600-metre-long section from Odenheim station to Odenheim Ost was closed. Since 1994 the line has been operated by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), who electrified it in 1998 and integrated it into the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. The line follows its namesake, the Katzbach stream, from Stettfeld to Odenheim. Together with the neighbouring Kraich Valley Railway from Bruchsal to Menzingen, with which it shares a common trackbed as far as Ubstadt Ort, it has formed a single operating unit since its inception. Route Stadtbahn train of the S31 in Odenheim station After Bruchsal station the Katzbach line runs together with the Kraich Valley Railway as a single track parallel with the Rhine Valley Railway through the stations of Bruchsal Schlossgarten and Bruchsal Stegwiesen before it leaves the main line for Ubstadt Ort, where it separates from the Kraich Valley Railway. The Katzbach Railway continues straight on to Ubstadt Uhlandstraße station and runs to Stettfeld next to the Kraichbach. At Stettfeld it turns to climb beside the Katzbach and passes through the hilly landscape of the Kraichgau. After it has passed through Zeutern, it reaches the current end of the line at Odenheim. The current line follows two river valleys, while the topographical conditions of the closed section to Hilsbach was much more difficult, which is the reason it was built later. Before the Baden-Württemberg administrative reform of 1973, the towns along the railway line from Bruchsal to Odenheim were in the district of Bruchsal, while the remaining municipalities (Tiefenbach, Eichelberg, Elsenz and Hilsbach) were part of the district of Sinsheim. The line was ultimately closed because the connection to Sinsheim was never completed and patronage on the last section of the line was rather low. Since the administrative reform both the municipalities and the districts that include the places along the line have become a bit more complicated: from Ubstadt to Zeutern the Katzbach line is within the municipality of Ubstadt-Weiher; Odenheim, Tiefenbach and Eichelberg are now municipality of Östringen, Elsenz is now part of Eppingen and Hilsbach is part of Sinsheim. Thus, the historic Katzbach line passes through three districts: the district of Karlsruhe from Bruchsal to Eichelberg, the district of Heilbronn in Elsenz and the former section to its terminus Hilsbach is part of the Rhein-Neckar district. =The route of the disused Odenheim–Hilsbach section= Cycle path on the closed Odenheim- Hilsbach section A cycle path that runs on the route of the old line begins on the other side of the street immediately after the current end of the line at Odenheim. Only a few metres after the start of the closed section there is a train signal, which was forgotten during the dismantling of the line. Near the next level crossing was the location of Odenheim Ost station, which was the end of the line from 1975 to 1986. At the eastern edge of Odenheim, the line was demolished over a length of about three hundred metres for the realignment of state highway 552. In Tiefenbach, the former line has also been converted into a cycle path. The railway viaduct over the Katzbach valley in Eichelberg is still preserved. It was renovated in 1988 by the City of Östringen at a cost of 155,000 Deutsche Marks and converted into a hiking and biking trail. The Elsenz station building has now been converted into residential accommodation; elsewhere in Elsenz the route of the line has been built on, but some sleepers still exist in Elsenz. Between Elsenz and Hilsbach the line climbs almost entirely through meadows and fields. There are also other smaller bridges over streams, including in Tiefenbach and Hilsbach, which are now used for hiking trails. History Stadtbahn train from Odenheim at the entrance to Ubstadt Ort station =Planning, construction and opening of the line (1870–1898)= In the 1870s, Bruchsal campaigned unsuccessfully for a rail link with the towns on the Kraichbach: Ubstadt, Unteröwisheim, Oberöwisheim, Münzesheim and Gochsheim. More than a decade later, the city took the initiative in 1888 to build, together with the municipalities in the Kraichbach and the Katzbach valleys, a narrow gauge branch line with two branches, separating in Ubstadt. The northern line would run through Odenheim to Elsenz and the southern branch up the Kraichbach valley to Gochsheim. Originally planned to run as far as Elsenz, it was decided that the line would initially run only as far as Odenheim because of the hilly terrain between Odenheim and Elsenz. At the same time, it was also decided that the line would be built at standard gauge. On 5 March 1896, what is now called the Katzbach railway was opened from Bruchsal to Odenheim together with the Kraich Valley Railway between Bruchsal and Menzingen. The line was initially operated by the Westdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West German Railway Company, WeEG). In the first years of operation, there was a high level of passenger traffic and some growth in freight traffic. Therefore, the municipalities of Tiefenbach, Eichelberg, Elsenz and Hilsbach were also interested in being connected to the line. In the longer term, the line was to be extended even towards Sinsheim. Former route of the line in Odenheim =The years under the BLEAG (1898–1931)= In October 1898, the WeEG operations on the Katzbach and the Kraich Valley Railways were transferred to its subsidiary, the Badische Lokal- Eisenbahnen Aktiengesellschaft (Baden Local Railway Company, BLEAG). An extension to Hilsbach was approved on 7 September 1899. However, the work required was very difficult because the terrain there was much hillier than between Bruchsal and Odenheim. Between Tiefenbach and Elsenz alone there was a height difference of about seventy metres. It was therefore necessary, for example, to build a three-span viaduct between Elsenz and Eichelberg. It was also necessary to demolish some houses in Odenheim for the extension. On 3 September 1900, the Katzbach line was extended from Odenheim to Hilsbach, with the intention of continuing the line to Sinsheim, but this was never implemented. The Kraich Valley and the Katzbach Railways were the two most profitable lines operated by BLEAG in the early years of the twentieth century. After the First World War, both lines were caught in a crisis because BLEAG had run out of funds for the maintenance of its lines. After the district of Karlsruhe agreed to contribute the funding of various BLEAG routes, the lines were temporarily saved. In subsequent years, normal operations were restored. In 1931, BLEAG had to file for bankruptcy during the Great Depression. Ubstadt Uhlandstr. station =The years under the DEBG (1932–1963)= In the wake of the bankruptcy, both of the BLEAG lines in the Kraich Valley and the Katzbach were taken over by the German Railway Operating Company (Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebs-Gesellschaft, DEBG) on 1 January 1932. DEBG managed to restore operations on the two lines. The outbreak of the Second World War meant that the passenger numbers increased significantly since private transport was restricted due to the war. Because of the fighting, however, operations had to be closed on 2 April 1945. Unlike the experience of many other rail lines, war damage on the two lines was limited. This allowed operations between Bruchsal and Odenheim to be resumed on 7 June 1945 and two weeks later to Hilsbach. The steam locomotives and passenger carriages on the line, which were up to fifty years old, were gradually replaced by diesel haulage from the mid-1950s. Thus, in 1955, DEBG operated a diesel locomotive and, in 1956, six diesel railcar formerly owned by Deutsche Bundesbahn and built in 1936 and 1937. However, the DEBG applied on 7 July 1958 to close all of its tracks in southern Germany. This was resisted by the state of Baden-Württemberg, in particular. Odenheim Ost station in 1986 There was little passenger and freight traffic in the postwar years, especially between Tiefenbach and Hilsbach. On 1 October 1960, therefore passenger services were discontinued between Tiefenbach and Hilsbach and twelve days later, following a derailment, freight traffic was abandoned. The weak track meant that continued operations no longer made sense and in subsequent years the tracks were dismantled on the section. =The years under the SWEG (1963–1994)= DEBG transferred, with effect from 1 May 1963, both lines to the Südwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (Southwest German Railway Company, SWEG), which had been founded on 10 December 1962 by the state of Baden-Württemberg to preserve a number of private lines before they were closed. The SWEG sought to modernise the line. Thus, the remaining steam trains were replaced by diesel locomotives after the takeover. They also introduced improvements to the line, which also shortened the travel time significantly. As a result, a trip from Bruchsal to Tiefenbach took only 39 minutes compared to 48 minutes previously. In 1968, Odenheim Ost station was opened to the east of Odenheim. Other additional stations that were opened on the Katzbach line in the following years were Ubstadt Nord (from the mid-1990s: Ubstadt Uhlandstraße), mainly serving the education centre in Ubstadt, Zeutern Ost and Odenheim Weberei (from 1977: Odenheim West). Odenheim West station On 31 January 1975, the eastern section from Odenheim Ost to Tiefenbach was closed. Odenheim Ost station, which had only been established in 1968, thus became the new terminus of the line. Two platforms were built with at the opening of the station, which were on opposite sides of a level crossing, so the outer platform towards Tiefenbach was abandoned and the remaining platform was provided with a buffer. From October 1981 services on the Katzbach line were strengthened by the introduction of class NE 81 diesel multiple units, which had been built by Waggon Union. However, the line was more and more under threat of total closure despite the modernisation carried out by SWEG. On 1 June 1986, the Odenheim–Odenheim Ost section was closed. =Acquisition by the AVG and upgrade for the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn (since 1994)= In order to preserve both the Katzbach and the neighbouring Kraichtal lines from total closure, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG) took over both sections from the SWEG in 1994. The line was originally operated with DMUs, including the class NE 81s that had been taken over from the SWEG. As part of the founding of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV), the service on the Katzbach line was named line R 31. The accident in 1998 involved a NE 81 Initially the AVG services was operated under the most recent timetable of the SWEG, but six months later the AVG introduced a regular interval schedule, which had not existed previously. At the same time as the line was acquired by AVG, it was decided to upgrade the line to Stadtbahn standards. After the Stadtbahn operations were opened in 1996 on the Kraich Valley Railway, a few improvements were made to services on the Katzbach Railway, because more rolling stock was now available. Also associated with the opening of Stadtbahn services on the Kraich Valley Railway between Bruchsal and the Ubstadt Ort stations, two new stations were opened at Bruchsal Schlossgarten and Bruchsal Stegwiesen, which were then also included in the services on the Katzbach Railway. In the summer of 1998, just months before the start of Stadtbahn operations, two diesel railcars (AVG VT VT 453 and 454) collided in Zeutern as one of the drivers had overlooked a signal. Zeutern Sportplatz station On 26 September 1998, Stadtbahn operations commenced on the Katzbach Railway, which were then integrated into the network as line S 31 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Just two weeks earlier, Stadtbahn sets were deployed for student transport. Zeutern Sportplatz station was opened along with Stadtbahn operations. Above all, Odenheim station was completely rebuilt for the Stadtbahn: the station building was torn down and a depot was built. Since not enough sets were available at the time of the opening of Stadtbahn operations for all services, a pair of services had to be operated by an Esslingen railbus, which was purchased from the SWEG; this was replaced after several years by Stadtbahn vehicles. Operations =Timetable= Stadtbahn service to Odenheim in Karlsruher Hbf. The Katzbach Railway is operated as line S 31 (Odenheim–Bruchsal–Karlsruhe Central Station—Malsch–Rastatt–Freudenstadt) of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Trains running instead to Forbach via Baden-Baden or Achern change line number to S 32 in Ubstadt Ort. During peak hours trains run at twenty-minute intervals, at other times they generally run hourly. Crossing opportunities exist in Ubstadt Ort, Stettfeld, Zeutern and Odenheim, while actual train crossings take place mainly in Zeutern and rather rarely in Stettfeld. All other stops on the Katzbach line are request stops. It is served by dual-system Stadtbahn vehicles operated by AVG. Fares on the entire route are set by the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund. =Platforms and station building= Bruchsal station and all stations from Ubstadt Uhlandstr. to Odenheim except Zeutern have a platform height of 55 centimetres, the other stations at Bruchsal Schlossgarten, Bruchsal Stegwiesen, Ubstadt Ort and Zeutern have a height of only 38 centimetres. The station building in Odenheim was demolished during the upgrade of the line for the Stadtbahn. The station building in Zeutern has been preserved and is now used as a residence. In Stettfeld the old platform, the freight loading dock and goods shed were demolished along with the station building during the construction of a large residential complex.

It was first defined by Kiparsky as a measure of the context or the consequences of a phonological process that may be determined only by examining the surface structure. Kiparsky defined it in the following way: A phonological rule P, A rightarrow B / C underline{quad} D, is opaque only if all of the following surface structures exist: * instance of A in the C underline{quad} D environment; * instance of B created by P in an environment other than C underline{quad} D; * instance of B not derived from P that occur in the context C underline{quad} D. A common example is the interaction of the flapping of // and the raising of // in Canadian English and other dialects. Before voiceless consonants such as [], the diphthong // is raised to sound more like [], so the word write is pronounced []. In some contexts between vowels, // is replaced by the (voiced) flap [], so (for example) patting is pronounced [], similar to padding. In words like writing, where // is followed by // between vowels, both rules apply and the result is []—with // raised to [] and // flapped to []. This output therefore has [] immediately followed by a voiced consonant, even though the rule that produces [] only applies before voiceless consonants. The interaction is thus opaque: [] is present on the surface in an environment that differs from the environment in which the rule that creates it applies. Counter-feeding and counter-bleeding opacity Phonological opacity is often the result of the counterfeeding or counterbleeding order of two or more phonological rules, which is called \\"counter-feeding opacity\\" or \\"counter-bleeding opacity\\". An example of both can be seen in the future- marking suffix -en in the Yokutsan languages. Its vowel is supposed to be an underlying high vowel, though it surfaces as a mid vowel. Vowel rounding always applies before vowel lowering. Due to this order of phonological rules, the interaction of the suffix vowel with rounding harmony is opaque. There is still vowel harmony between the suffix vowel and a preceding high vowel as these vowels agree in roundedness, while a vowel with the feature [-high] would usually be exempt from rounding harmony. As a result of counter-bleeding opacity, the apparent motivation for the vowel harmony has disappeared here. Moreover, as a result of counter-feeding opacity, it cannot be told from the surface structure of the suffix vowel why it fails to harmonize in rounding with preceding mid vowels.John A.

Background Director and screenwriter of this adaptation is Maciej Wojtyszko. The story =Three layers= The film is an adaptation of the novel The Master and Margarita written by the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov. Three storylines are interwoven. * The first one is a satire of the ‘30s in the 20th century, the period during which Joseph Stalin is in power in the Soviet Union. The demon Woland comes to Moscow to have his annual Spring Ball of the Full Moon. Together with his demonic suite, he challenges the corrupt lucky ones, bureaucrats and profiteers of that period in an hilarious way.. * The second one is set in the biblical Yershalaim, and describes the inner struggle of Pontius Pilate before, during and after the conviction and execution of Yeshua Ha Nozri. * The third one tells the love story between a nameless writer in Moscow in the ’30s and his lover Margarita. The Master has written a novel on Pontius Pilate, a subject which was taboo in the officially atheistic Soviet Union. =Differences with the novel= This series follows faithfully the storyline of Bulgakov’s original novel, except for the nighttime scenes. While many scenes in Bulgakov’s novel are playing in the dark, it's always daytime in this adaptation. Due to the limited budget, Wojtyszko said he had focused on good acting rather than on special effects. At least one character was 'added' by the staff of Mr. Wojtyszko to the number appearing in the original novel by Bulgakov - i. e. a 'Ms. Karaulina' (featured by Ms. K. Sienkiewicz [1935-2017]) - a 'mother' (as she describes herself at the Griboyedov) and a writer, who 'wrote five kolkhoz novels in sixteen years with no leave', whose 'windows face a WC' and who is 'chased around the flat by a lunatic with axt'. As well, Anna Richardovna (featured by Ms. M. Zawadzka, b. 1944) is falsely described at the end of Part 2 as 'the secretary to Proleshnev' actually being one to Prokhor Petrovich. Episodes 1.

This is software enabling a computer which hasn't been specifically made to be a router into a wireless access point. It is often used interchangeably with the term \\"virtual router\\". History on Windows The first SoftAP software was shipped by Ralink with their Wi-Fi cards for Windows XP. It enabled a Wi-Fi card to act as a wireless access point. While a card was acting as a wireless access point, it could not continue to stay connected as a client, so any Internet access had to come from another device, such as an Ethernet device. Following Ralink's card innovation, a number of other Wi-Fi vendors, including Edimax, later released SoftAP software for their devices. Neither Ralink nor Edimax updated their software to work with Windows Vista, due to the installation of its new driver model, bringing an effective end to this software category until the release of Windows 7 in 2009. Microsoft added a feature called \\"Virtual Wi-Fi\\" to Windows 7 and later operating systems, which enabled a Wi-Fi card to act as both a Wi-Fi client and a wireless access point simultaneously. Although a relatively fresh concept, new computers with Windows 7 and above were now being released with \\"Virtual WiFi\\" as a default program, making personal computing less complicated without the need for a second device. With this \\"technological advancement\\", the \\"virtual\\" Wi-Fi feature allows desktop computers to create a wireless hotspot / portable hotspot / Wi-Fi hotspot that other wireless devices in the vicinity can use. The feature was ultimately considered \\"unfinished\\", as it never received a user interface. Unfortunately, \\"Virtual WiFi\\" was not enthusiastically promoted amongst the industry, either on its own merit, or with the help of marketing materials at launch. Purpose SoftAP is a common method of configuring Wi-Fi products without a display or input device, such as a Wi-Fi enabled appliance, home security camera, smart home product or any other IoT device. The process typically involves these steps: # The headless device turns on a SoftAP Wi-Fi hotspot. # The user downloads a product-specific app on a smartphone, and the app then either uses the underlying Android or iOS operating system to connect to the SoftAP hotspot, or directs the user to connect the phone manually. # The app then asks the user for the user's private Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and passkey # The app sends the SSID and passkey to the headless device over the SoftAP connection. # The headless device then falls off the SoftAP network and joins the user's private Wi-Fi network. This process can work well, but there are two core problems. First, the process often requires the user to manually connect to the SoftAP network, which can be confusing for mainstream users. Second, if the user enters the passkey incorrectly, or if the phone gets disconnected from the SoftAP network for any reason, it is difficult for the app and device to smoothly recover, so the user is often left having to factory reset the device and start over. Third, different phones (hardware and OS versions) handle SoftAP differently, so the user experience varies dramatically -- especially with the wide variety of Android hardware and software. Because of these complexities, many companies making Wi-Fi connected products are now adding BLE, ZipKey, data- over-sound, or another technology to facilitate a better out-of-box experience for users. http://www.ti.com/lit/wp/swry011/swry011.pdf https://blog.cirrent.com/challenges-soft-ap https://www.zipkey.net/ Wi-Fi Internet of things Platform support Various operating system platforms support SoftAP, including: * Linux * Windows 7 * Windows 8 * Windows 10 * Android * Windows Phone 7.5 * Windows Phone 8 * Windows 10 Mobile * iOS Commercial vendors * Connectify * Edimax * Ralink See also * Wi-Fi Direct * Connectify References Network access ","title":"SoftAP"},{"id":"31182941","text":"Pougues-les-Eaux is a railway station in Pougues-les-Eaux, Bourgogne-Franche- Comté, France.

The highway runs between intersections with US 1 in Arbutus and in Baltimore. US 1 Alternate serves the southwestern Baltimore County community of Halethorpe and connects US 1 with full-access interchanges with Interstate 95 and I-695. The Washington Boulevard portion of the alternate route was the original road southwest from Baltimore in the 18th century and was part of the turnpike southwest to Washington for much of the 19th century. The highway was paved in the early 1910s, expanded in the late 1910s and late 1920s, and became part of US 1 in 1926. The Caton Avenue portion of the alternate route was improved and expanded in the 1930s to serve as a rerouting of US 1 in southwest Baltimore. US 1 Alternate was created in 1949 when US 1 was moved to its present course through Arbutus and southwest Baltimore. The alternate route's interchanges with I-695 and I-95 were constructed in the late 1950s and mid-1970s, respectively. Route description View south along US 1 Alternate in Halethorpe US 1 Alternate begins at a partial interchange with US 1, which heads north as Southwestern Boulevard through Arbutus and south as Washington Boulevard toward Elkridge. There is no access from southbound US 1 Alternate to northbound US 1 or from southbound US 1 to northbound US 1 Alternate. US 1 Alternate heads northeast as Washington Boulevard, a four-lane undivided highway that immediately crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and Herbert Run. The highway passes through Halethorpe, where the route temporarily expands to a divided highway through its three-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no ramp from eastbound I-695 to US 1 Alternate; that movement is made via a ramp from eastbound I-695 to Sulphur Spring Road, which intersects US 1 Alternate at the I-695 junction, at the I-95–I-695 interchange to the west. US 1 Alternate continues northeast to an intersection with Caton Avenue and Hammonds Ferry Road just south of the Baltimore city limits. The alternate route leaves Washington Boulevard to turn north onto four-lane divided Caton Avenue and enters the independent city. US 1 Alternate then meets the western end of Patapsco Avenue at a directional intersection from which the latter avenue heads southeast. There is no direct access from Patapsco Avenue to the southbound alternate route or from the southbound alternate route to eastbound Patapsco Avenue; those movements are made via Washington Boulevard. US 1 Alternate heads north as a six-lane divided highway through a seven-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway reduces to a four-lane undivided highway and passes by Seton Keough High School, the former Cardinal Gibbons School, and St. Agnes Hospital before reaching its northern terminus at US 1 (Wilkens Avenue). Caton Avenue continues north through West Baltimore toward MD 144 and US 40. All of US 1 Alternate is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial. History Washington Boulevard was first laid out as the highway southwest from Baltimore in 1741 and was improved by the Baltimore and Washington Turnpike Company starting in 1812. After the state condemned the turnpike in 1865, maintenance of the highway became the responsibility of the counties. In 1906, the state took over maintenance as the road as part of its construction of State Road No. 1. The highway from west of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) to the city limits of Baltimore at Gwynns Falls was reconstructed as a concrete road by 1915. The work included a bridge across the Pennsylvania Railroad at Winans. Washington Boulevard was widened to with a pair of concrete shoulders and resurfaced with sheet asphalt in 1918, part of a project to expand the entire highway from Washington to Baltimore to . The highway, which was marked as US 1 in 1926, was widened to with the addition of a pair of concrete shoulders and resurfaced with sheet asphalt in the late 1920s. Caton Avenue was paved as a concrete road from Washington Boulevard to Wilkens Avenue starting in 1930. Caton Avenue was widened and repaved, along with Wilkens Avenue east from Caton Avenue, in 1936 as part of plans to create through-traffic streets through Baltimore for US 1 and US 40 traffic. That same year, Washington Boulevard's modern bridge across the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed. US 1 originally followed Washington Boulevard and Monroe Street in southwest Baltimore, but the highway was rerouted along Caton Avenue and Wilkens Avenue by 1939. After US 1 was moved to its present course along Wilkens Avenue and Southwestern Boulevard in 1949, the old route of the U.S. Highway along Washington Boulevard and Caton Avenue became US 1 Alternate. Further expansion of US 1 Alternate occurred as a result of Interstate highway construction. The alternate route was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with I-695 when that interchange was constructed between 1956 and 1958. This interchange included all of the ramps on the east side of the interchange, but on the west side it also included ramps from southbound US 1 Alternate to westbound I-695, from southbound US 1 Alternate to eastbound I-695, and from eastbound I-695 to Sulphur Spring Road, which passed closer to the Interstate than it does now. The I-695–US 1 Alternate interchange was reduced to its present ramps after the I-95–I-695 interchange, including that interchange's ramp to relocated Sulphur Spring Road, was completed in 1971. Most of the Caton Avenue portion of US 1 Alternate was expanded to a divided highway in 1972 in conjunction with the completion of the western half of I-95's interchange with US 1 Alternate. The eastern half of the I-95 interchange was completed in 1977 when I-95 was extended east to Russell Street.

The bus was returning to Chinatown, Manhattan, from the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. It swerved and collided with a metal sign pole, which ripped through it and tore off most of its roof. Thirteen passengers died at the scene, two died at hospitals, and all seventeen others on board were injured. Cause =Conditions of the crash= Some surviving passengers have said that the driver, Ophadell Williams, fell asleep at the wheel. He was not charged initially, pending investigation. Williams said that he was awake and sober at the time of the accident. The bus driver blamed the accident on a tractor-trailer that he swerved to avoid, causing the bus to flip on its side and crash into an overhead highway sign which split the bus in half. He said the two possibly hit each other. The crash triggered an investigation by the New York State Police and National Transportation Safety Board. =Preliminary NTSB findings= A preliminary report by the NTSB in April 2011 found that the bus was going at the time of the crash, 14 miles per hour faster than the posted speed limit. The report found that the bus had been exceeding the speed limit on I-95 45 seconds before it veered off the highway. The report said that there was no evidence of contact between the bus and a passing truck, as claimed by the driver. The truck driver was located by authorities, denied the bus driver's account and was cleared of responsibility. State officials revoked the bus driver's driving privileges after reports became public of Williams's criminal record, which includes having served time for convictions of manslaughter and larceny. Prosecution of Ophadell Williams The driver, Ophadell Williams, was charged by the Bronx County District Attorney's office with 54 felony and misdemeanor counts, including charges of criminally negligent homicide and manslaughter. Prosecutors argued that Williams was too tired to get behind the wheel, and was so sleep-deprived that his actions were no different than someone driving under the influence. Williams was held in custody from September 2011 until the end of his trial due to being unable to meet his $250,000 bail. On December 7, 2012, the jury found Williams not guilty of all charges except one count of misdemeanor aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Due to spending over a year in jail, his sentence was commuted to time served.

He painted from nature, en plein air, and used favorite motifs in abstract paintings, referred to as \\"studio paintings\\". He, also, enjoyed woodcuts which were predominantly printed in black and white. Known for his humor, love of jazz, and his upbeat approach to painting, “his work expresses the joy of life and love of place”.Lois Katz, Interview with George Sheridan, page 74  Biography  Born in Malden, Massachusetts, Berger was the son of first-generation Jews from Lithuania and Latvia, on his mother’s side, and from Russia and Lithuania on his father’s side. Speaking only Yiddish till the age of three, he grew up in the Boston suburbs and attended Roxbury Memorial High School. Encouraged by his mother and uncle, J.P.Savel, illustrator for the Boston Post, Berger’s interest and passion in painting were evident very early. As a teen in the mid-nineteen thirties, he painted en plein air regularly emulating the influences he saw in Boston. His love of the old masters, the immediate approach of the watercolors of John Singer Sargent and Winslow Homer, and the current trends of Modernism, Cubism and Abstraction were the influences that would stay with him throughout his life.Lois Katz, Interview with Jason Berger, page 89, 4th paragraph. At a young age, he frequented the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston and haunted the Boston Public Library, reading all he could on painting and painting techniques. His focus on painting was recognized during high school by acceptance to the “Vocational Art Classes”Lois Katz, page 29. at the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston where he studied drawing and composition in the afternoons. With this preparation, he received a full scholarship to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston in 1941. Karl Zerbe, the principle painting teacher at the school, thought Berger and his classmates, Reed Kay, Jack Kramer, David Aronson, and George Sheridan were among best students.Lois Katz, Interview with Jason Berger, page 38. Karl Zerbe, a German citizen, received his position at the Museum School in 1937 after a year at Harvard University. Like Hans Hofmann, who immigrated in the 1930s to New York City, Karl Zerbe brought the tenets of European Modernism to Boston. “For eager young Americans, most of whom had traveled little—and constrained in the 1930s by the Depression and in the 1940s by World War II and its aftermath—contact with Hofmann (and Zerbe) served as an invaluable alternative for direct contact with the European sources of Modernism”.Hans Hofmann Biography, www.hanshofmann.org, Biography-4th paragraph Unlike Hoffman, whose emphasis was in abstraction and initiated the Abstract Expressionists, Zerbe was well rooted in the expressionismLois Katz, page 39, 2nd paragraph and spawned the Boston Expressionists. Associated with the Boston Expressionists are Jack Levine, Hyman Bloom, Khalil Gibran,Lois Katz, page 63 as well as, Zerbe’s students-Jason Berger, David Aronson, Reed Kay, Jack Kramer, Bernie Chaet, Arthur Polonsky, and George Sheridan. In the 1940s, the Expressionist enthusiasm in Boston would materialize in exhihibitions of Max Beckmann, Chaim Soutine, Oskar Kokoschka, Marc Chagall, and James Ensor before they were exhibited in New York City.Lois Katz, Interview with Jason Berger, page 39, 2nd paragraph World War II interrupted Berger's college education with three years in the Army, 1943-1946. Returning from the war, he graduated from college in 1948. Afterwards, with a traveling scholarship awarded by the School of the Museum of Fine Art, Boston, Berger went to Europe with his first wife, the painter Marilyn Powers. In addition to the European Traveling Fellowship, Berger received several awards, including the Grand Prize for Painting from Jacques Lipchitz at the Boston Arts Festival in 1956 and the Clarissa Bartlett Traveling Award in 1957.Katherine French, Catalogue; Danforth Museum, page 12 While in France, Berger studied with cubist sculptor Ossip Zadkine in Paris and frequented Georges Braque's studio. He also met MatisseLois Katz, Interview with Jason Berger, page 59 and absorbed the direct influences of Bonnard, Dufy, Picasso and Soutine.Lois Katz, Interview with Jason Berger, page 49, 2nd paragraph Upon his return to the United States, Berger began teaching first at Mount Holyoke College (1955), and then enjoyed a long tenure teaching at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1956–69). He taught briefly at Wellesley College (1957–59), The State University of New York at Buffalo (1969–70) and The Metropolitan College at Boston University (1971–72). Until his retirement, he taught at The Art Institute of Boston (1973–88). During the summers, the Bergers traveled and painted en plein air in France, Mexico and Portugal. After his wife, Marilyn Powers, died in 1976 of cancer, he returned to Portugal where he met Estela Cuoto who became his second wife in 1978. They eventually moved to Portugal in 1994. Berger lost his second wife, Estela, in 1997. Berger remained in Portugal, where he eventually married the painter Leena Rekola in 1999. The couple moved back to Boston in March 2008. He died in October 2010. Berger continued to work directly from nature until his death, always putting the \\"picture first and feeding nature into it\\".Lois Katz, Interview with Reed Kay, page 35, 1st paragraph This focus on combining the formal elements of color, shape and compositional scheme to make a good picture, never interfered with an overall joy of discovery through the act of painting. His approach was direct, his vision clear, and his paintings full of structural elegance, with the results a positive and optimistic expression.

The episode, hosted by Ling, profiles several people as they seek to reconcile their homosexuality with their Christianity. It originally aired on OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network on March 8, 2011. Speaking for those who believe that Christianity and homosexuality are incompatible was Alan Chambers, president of Exodus International, an ex-gay organization. Also interviewed were Janet Boynes, a woman who states she \\"walked away\\" from lesbianism eleven years earlier and who now runs her own ex-gay ministry, a man named Christian whom Janet has been counseling for the last four years and another man named Ethan, whom Ling met at an Exodus conference. Each of the men acknowledged that they still had feelings of attraction to the same sex. Only Boynes said she had no such feelings. Ling also interviewed several people who had reconciled their sexuality and their faith. Among them was Michael Bussee, who had co-founded Exodus International in 1976 only to leave the group in 1979 when he found himself falling in love with another male founding member. Ling spotlighted The Naming Project, a summer camp program for gay and questioning Christian young people. Gay Lutheran and Naming Project co-founder Jay Wiesner was interviewed along with campers Chelsea, who went from being a closeted cheerleader to an openly lesbian prom queen, and Julian, who had been fired as a counselor-in-training at a Christian camp just two weeks before filming when his homosexuality was discovered. Ling's examination of these two \\"paths\\" led her to conclude, \\"I'm not sure which path is more difficult, but while they couldn't be more different, I think they're both traveling in the same direction.\\" Following the broadcast, Gayle King hosted Ling for a one-hour live program called \\"Pray the Gay Away? The Conversation Continues\\" featuring follow-up interviews with some of the participants and telephone calls from the public. Also appearing was Rashad Robinson from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) who questioned Ling's decision not to place the individual stories she reported into the larger context of anti-gay discrimination in the United States and psychologist Andrea Macåri who noted that there is no reputable medical evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Critical response GLAAD Media Strategist Justin Ward criticized \\"Pray the Gay Away?\\" for asking \\"a question that's already been answered\\". Noting that it has been almost 40 years since the American Psychological Association concluded that homosexuality is not a disorder, Ward called OWN \\"irresponsible\\" for broadcasting a program that he said had the potential to do harm to young people who may be enduring bullying and harassment for being gay. Ling, he added, should have included more information on the Christian denominations that accept LGBT people and that literal interpretation is only one of many ways to interpret the Bible.\\"GLAAD's Media Strategist Lashes Out Against Lisa Ling's 'Pray The Gay Away (2011) Instinct Wayne Besen, founder of Truth Wins Out and a vocal critic of the ex-gay movement, faulted \\"Pray the Gay Away?\\" and Ling for an apparent lack of research into Exodus. He noted in particular the statement that \\"Exodus no longer promises to make you straight\\", which he disputed, and the failure to note that Janet Boynes is listed as a resource on Exodus's website. Besen called on OWN to refrain from re-broadcasting the episode.\\"Lisa Ling's 'Ex-Gay' Puff Piece\\" (March 17 2011) The Advocate A reviewer for gay-interest website AfterElton.com took Ling to task for presenting the ex-gay movement and the gay people of faith movement as morally equivalent. Noting a quote of Ling's from an earlier episode of Our America in which she deplores the manipulation of peoples' faith, he expressed disappointment at Ling's failure to expose the manipulations perpetrated by Exodus.\\"Lisa Ling's 'Our America' Asks Can You 'Pray the Gay Away?' Forcing Us to Ask, 'Seriously? (March 2011) AfterElton Conversely, a reviewer for AfterElton's sister site, the lesbian-interest AfterEllen.com, called the episode \\"balanced and moving\\". Finding the episode to be less of a full exploration of the subject and more of a starting point for dialogue, she hoped that Ling would revisit the topic in a future episode and focus on whether sexual orientation is biologically based or behavioural.Lisa Ling’s Our America' asks 'Can you pray the gay away? (March 2011) AfterEllen Follow-up On August 21, 2012, OWN aired a follow-up to \\"Pray the Gay Away?\\" entitled \\"Pray the Gay Away? — Breaking News\\". In it, Ling interviews Alan Chambers again about supposed changes in both his positions and the stances of Exodus International on the ex-gay subject. She also catches up with Christian, whom Ling describes as having \\"lost a little bit of light in his eyes\\".\\"Lisa Ling Revisits Exodus In 'Pray The Gay Away' Tonight On OWN's 'Our America (August 21, 2012) The Backlot OWN aired a third, special episode of Our America on June 20, 2013.

A milieu of hormones simultaneously affects development of the fetus during embryogenesis and the mother, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone (P4).  Embryogenesis  Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, 17β-estradiol, endorphins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis are rapidly upregulated by the developing embryo following fertilization of the ovum.Zhuang, L., & Li, R.

Biochemical characterization and modulation of LH/CG-receptor during human trophoblast differentiation. Journal of Cell Physiology, 212, 26–35. During early embryonic development, paracrine/juxtacrine signaling of hCG induces blastulation and neurulation. An in vitro model of early human embryogenesis (human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)) has demonstrated that hCG promotes cell proliferation via the LH/hCG receptor (LHCGR). hCG signaling upregulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-mediated cholesterol transport and the synthesis of progesterone in hESC. The production of progesterone at this time induces embryroid body (akin to blastulation) and rosette (akin to neurulation) formation in vitro. Progesterone induces the differentiation of pluripotent hESC to neural precursor cells.Gallego, M. et al (2009). Opioid and progesterone signaling is obligatory for early human embryogenesis. Stem Cells Development, 18, 737–740.Gallego, M. et al (2010). The pregnancy hormones human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone induce human embryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation into neuroectodermal rosettes. Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 1, 1-13 Suppression of P4 signaling following withdrawal of progesterone, or treatment with the progesterone receptor antagonist RU-486 (mifepristone), inhibits the differentiation of hESC colonies into embryoid bodies (blastulation) or rosettes (neurulation). RU-486, a drug commonly used to terminate pregnancy in its early stages, acts not only to abort the embryo, but also to inhibit normal embryonic development.  Influence of Maternal Hormones  Pregnancy-associated hormones such as hCG and sex steroids regulate numerous biological processes in the maternal system prior to and during pregnancy. The embryo orchestrates biological changes that occur in both the embryo and the mother. The embryo upregulates hCG, drives growth of the cell, and upregulates P4 production driving development. hCG and P4 direct changes in the mother to enable successful pregnancy (see below) via upregulation of specific hormones that act to direct both endocrinological and biological changes within the mother for successful pregnancy. = Maintenance of the endometrial lining = The early embryo has 1–2 weeks in order to produce sufficient hCG in order to stabilize the endometrial lining to allow for blastocyst attachment.

Jr. County Labor Council, AFL-CIO, (MLKCLC) is the central body of labor organizations in King County, Washington. The MLKCLC is affiliated with the national AFL-CIO, the central labor organization in the United States, which represents more than 13 million working people. Over 125 organizations are affiliated with the MLKCLC, and more than 75,000 working men and women belong to Council-affiliated organizations. Not only does the MLKCLC support labor organizations, but it acts as a voice for the interests and needs of the working people in King County, WA.  Mission statement  The core responsibilities of the MLKCLC are to assist workers and their unions in the struggle for social and economic justice; support efforts to organize and bargain fair contracts; lobby, endorse and involve working people in the political process; advocate and support laws that protect working people; support community services outreach work; and unite with community allies who are also struggling for justice.  Early years 1888-1903  In 1888, the West Central Labor Union (WCLU) was organized by its first president, O.F. Wegener, in Seattle, Washington. The WCLU is the first of many names the Council has adopted over the years. Despite being a union itself, the WCLU represented almost every trade and labor union in the area including the Knights of Labor Assembly and the Miners Unions of Newcastle, Cedar Mountain and Renton. One of the many ways the WCLU promoted their cause of workers’ rights was through Labor Day Parades held on Labor Day. The parades represented every trade union of Seattle with AFL and Knights of Labor leaders’ pictures displayed throughout the parade.[Central] Along with Labor Day Parades, the WCLU advocated for workers by obtaining direct control over its newspaper the Union Record in 1903 by buying it from its publisher. The Union Record was the \\"official organ\\" of the WCLU and it strived to exclude politics, emphasizing that it was \\"not a socialist paper.\\" In 1891 Oregon Improvement Co. brought in hundreds of black laborers from the South into various mining towns in King County to break labor disputes. The Miners Unions responded by appealing to the WLCU for moral and financial support. In spite of strong support the mine owners prevailed in large part due to the economic depression at the time. [Central] As a result of this defeat, the Knights of Labor and trade unions in the WLCU went into a period of decline. Although the WCLU aimed at promoting fair labor by operating its own employment referral \\"hiring hall,\\" in 1893 public criticism of this effort arose centered around complaints of excessive fees and fictitious jobs. This criticism prompted the WCLU to collaborate with the unorganized workers which, along with W.G. Armstrong of the Typographers Union, worked to pass an ordinance by the city council which established the free employment bureau. [Central] The bureau was solidified by the charter provision and consolidated with the Civil Service Department in 1895. During this time, the charter reelected 15 freeholders from organized labor and addressed eight-hour work days and safety inspection of boilers in the work place. The late 1800s and early 1900s saw a growth in the organization and an increase in union memberships. In 1900 several new unions – Cooks and Waitresses Union, Barbers Union, Leather Workers Union and Telephone Operators Union – were organized and joined the WCLU. Due to the growth, $14,000 was raised to build a new Labor Temple in Seattle, WA. [Central] Mainstay unions of the WCLU at this time were the Sailors, Brewery Workers, Cigarmakers, Tailors, Stonecutters, Typographers, Iron Molders, Stage Employees, Musicians, Bricklayers, Printing Pressmen and Newsboys unions.  SCLC 1905-1919  In 1905 the WCLU changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity, which was often called the Seattle Central Labor Council (SCLC) or simply the Central Labor Council. The council was a key supporter of the Populist movement, as represented by the organizing of the People's Party during the rise and fall of the progressive coalition from 1909 to 1917. In 1914 there labor shortages prompted unions to organize much of Seattle's workforce. The SCLC went through a radical phase which manifested itself as strong support for the progressive coalition. This momentum was lost with the ending of World War I in 1918 and the resulting layoff and economic depression. [AFL-CIO] The layoffs and regressive bargaining by employers post war led the SCLC to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919. The strike had over 65,000 Seattle workers walk out, and was heavily supported by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Fears that the strike was a radical effort to destabilize and overthrow the government doomed the strike, causing the AFL to pressure leaders to end the strike. A lack of common vision in terms of the goals of the strike is typically credited as the reason the strike failed to achieve the progressive reforms envisioned by the organizers. After the end of the Strike, employers organized an open-shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. The rise of more centrist labor elements post-strike led to power struggles within the SCLC that culminated in a vote to expel several of the more radical IWW activists. The Council became more conservative and eventually began to \\"tread the line of Craft Unionism\\". This resulted in a decline of membership. = Conservative influence 1920-1955 = From 1920 to 1955 only AFL-affiliated unions were represented by the SCLC. During this phase there was a considerable conservative influence from Dave Beck, a prominent Teamster on the West Coast and eventual President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). Although he was instrumental in rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle, his conservative business unionism approach was very different from the Council's previous radical ideologies. During the Great Depression, many workers favored Beck's conservative style over the more progressive politics of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). As a result, Seattle was an anti-radical, closed shop, AFL town. Throughout Beck's influence, the SCLC stayed away from politics and only endorsed \\"moderate pro- labor Democrats,\\" rejecting leftist coalitions.  Reentry into local politics 1955-1960s  In 1955 the AFL and CIO merged, which greatly expanded the SCLC bringing the CIO's more politically active approach to the council. During this time, the council combated statewide \\"Right-to-Work\\" open shop efforts enabled by passage of the national Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. The SCLC was a leading player in the defeat of these measures. [AFL-CIO] In response to Right to Work attacks the SCLC started a \\"pro-labor public relations campaign\\" in 1959. The campaign was a way for labor leaders to get their voice heard by using radio and television medians. It also donated to many charities and became involved in other civic activities. [AFL-CIO] By 1968, the Seattle Central Labor Council changed its name to King County Labor Council (KCLC). In 1961, Chet Ramage, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the King County Labor Council led an effort to allow Sunday liquor sales by banning the Washington 1909 \\"blue law\\", which outlaws the sale of liquor on Sundays. In spite of a robust campaign, the legislature took no action based on opposing letters and telegrams. The proposal raised awareness about race, collective bargaining and politics. Although the KCLC had reentered more progressive local politics, there was still some remnants of business unionism facilitating a no-strike agreement for the construction and operation of the facilities for 1962 World's Fair. [AFL-CIO] There were threats to strike the Fair, dubbed the Century 21 Exposition, because the concessionaires, exhibitors and departments resisted protected labor activism among their employees. In 1964 the KCLC's political arm, the \\"Committee on Political Education\\", was very effective in local elections. The growth of the public sector unions and the addition of progressive CIO unions saw it back expanded social services and public housing proposals. Seattle civil rights groups were eventually supported by the Council in the 1960s, as well. [AFL-CIO] The Scanner, a biweekly labor newspaper, was born on August 30, 1968. The KCLC published the newspaper and distributed it to its 138 AFL-CIO affiliated unions and reached about 75,000 people on average. Its purpose was to keep members informed on union actions and it was known for advertising union businesses. A special feature of the newspaper included the KCLC's regular list of businesses to boycott. The Scanner was heavily involved in politics and often endorsed candidates from the Democratic Party. With the emergence of the electronic communication age, publication of The Scanner ended in 1992.  1970s  During the 1970s the KCLC grew more and more pro-active on progressive labor rights. They urged and sanctioned many strikes throughout the King County area. In 1971 a radical resolution was passed by the delegate body empowering the KCLC to call for a national one-day strike against President Richard Nixon because of what it believed to be his unfair and unworkable labor policies. Although that proposal did not result in a national work stoppage, the KCLC moved to address a festering local issue by sanctioning the first teachers strike in Washington, led by American Federation of Teachers (AFT) members at Seattle Community College in 1972. In 1974 the Arab Oil Embargo and subsequent worldwide oil shortage spurred then Executive Secretary Treasurer James K. Bender to threaten a citywide strike because unregulated gasoline distribution could lead to shortages that would prevent workers from getting to work. The KCLC continued to be involved in various strikes for workers’ rights such as the Custodians strike of 1975, and the sanctioning of the second Seattle Community College strike of 1976. = 1980s = The KCLC strengthened their stance on pro-labor rights when they actively supported the Hotel and Restaurant Employees strike of 1981. Twenty-one restaurants and hotels were affected around the greater Seattle area. The Council urged all of its members to honor picket lines, while offering strike benefits, as well. An estimated 2000–3000 restaurant employees and 5000 hotel employees walked out in a demand for higher wages. In 1984, the Council's 50,000 union members were asked to oppose levies proposed by the Seattle School District to show support for school custodians and other union workers who had been working for two years without a contract. The proposed levies included a $69.5 million two-year operating levy and a $64 million, six-year levy for capital improvements. The KCLC supported the players strike against the National Football League in 1987. Then Executive Secretary Treasurer Dan Bickford urged a protest against NFL Seattle Seahawks games that used strike replacement players. Bickford affirmed that the same issues other unions face: \\"worker rights, fair treatment, fair share of revenues and the right to bargain and speak without reprisal\\" were issues that every working person faced. In July 1989 the media highlighted KCLC's refusal to make a political candidate endorsement based on the pro-choice abortion issue. Women's rights advocates urged organized labor's support for the upcoming elections. However, the KCLC took a more conservative position that pro-choice issues were not labor issues. That same month, the KCLC asked its members to not cross picket lines of nurses belonging to Washington's largest health care provider, Group Health. The strike centered on pay and proper staffing levels. It was reported that 95% of the hospital's nurses went on strike.  1990s  In 1991 the KCLC, and its 85,000 members, opposed a project by the Seattle School Board called Step Forward. The project's purpose was designed to promote school leadership and public education which was established by CEOs from Safeco, Boeing and other large corporations. However, KCLC President Dale Daugherty deemed Step Forward as \\"the attempt of business to seize control of the School Board and turn it into a board that functions like boards of directors of corporations.\\" The KCLC stated that many of those same corporations, like Boeing, have been against tax laws that would benefit public education. A coalition in opposition to this effort was formed by the KCLC, called \\"Public in Public Education\\". Its focus emphasized funding for schools and education reform. Two months later, the KCLC threatened a boycott of Nordstrom, a popular local clothing store seeking to expand out of its Seattle base, after an internal battle between the company and United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1001'. The union instituted a negative publicity campaign against Nordstrom based on unfair worker treatment that included a class-action lawsuit claiming that workers were forced to work \\"off the clock\\" – uncompensated hours. However, the union was decertified in an election when Nordstrom employees voted against union representation. In 1993, during the KCLC's Labor Day picnic, a yearly institution that had replaced the annual Labor Day Parade, Washington Governor Mike Lowry expressed his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA was widely opposed by the U.S. labor movement and Lowry's announcement was not well received. The agreement proposed to allow the free movement of goods, services and investments between the United States, Canada and Mexico without restrictions. Labor's position in opposition centered on concerns relating to a wage \\"race to the bottom\\" if the higher wage U.S. economy was forced to compete directly with the relatively low wages of Mexico. In 1997, the KCLC sponsored a rally by the Washington apple workers with a demand for higher wages and better working conditions. The Teamsters and the United Farm Workers unions were heavily involved in the rally. Other sponsors included Jobs With Justice, the Washington Association of Churches and the Washington Alliance for Immigrants and Refugee Justice. In the summer of 1998, the KCLC, along with help from its affiliates created a Seattle Organizing Center (SOC) that aimed at recruiting and training workers looking to organize. The teachers of First Hill Day Care center hoped to use the SOC as a way to finally unionize. While this effort was ultimately unsuccessful, it signaled a growing emphasis by the central labor council in grass roots organizing. The KCLC developed a Right to Organize Plan in 1999 for the Seattle Unions Now (SUN) program. SUN was a KCLC sponsored organization dedicated to capacity-building, multi-union efforts, ambitious unions and labor campaigns. The Right to Organize Plan focused on mobilizing, community and religious outreach, political accountability and organizing contingent workers. In November 30, 1999 the KCLC was a key player in a nationwide historical event, the protests of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference (WTO). The protests set for the Washington Trade and Convention Center in Seattle sought to emphasize 21st century free trade as promoted by the supporters of economic globalization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A broad coalition of progressive activists protested the larger effects of globalization in terms of issues like environmental protection and animal rights issues. The KCLC, along with many other pro-labor groups, voiced its concerns on \\"forced labor and substandard working conditions in developing countries, where increasing numbers of U.S. corporations were relocating to take advantage of cheap labor.\\" The environmentalists and pro-labor activists protested side by side facing very aggressive law enforcement tactics that included the used tear gas and curfews. Then KCLC Executive Secretary Treasurer Ron Judd, established a \\"Hate Free Zone\\" at the Seattle Labor Temple in the downtown Belltown neighborhood as a place where protesters would not be harassed by law enforcement.  2000-2020  The first major labor action in the new century occurred in 2000 when the KCLC actively supported aerospace giant Boeing's striking engineers and technicians as represented by the then unaffiliated Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA). The KCLC's affiliated AFL-CIO unions joined together with SPEEA during a 31-day strike against Boeing. As a result of the success of the strike SPEEA affiliated with the International Professional and Technical Employees Union and the KCLC. By 2003 the issue of immigrant rights came to the fore with then KCLC Executive Secretary Steve Williamson, voicing his support of the \\"Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride\\"' – a bus trip of immigration activists from all over the U.S. to Washington D.C. The KCLC by then had helped establish the nonprofit \\"Hate Free Zone Campaign of Washington\\" leveraging the success associated with the Hate Free Zone WTO effort into a new organization devoted to advocating for immigrant rights. In 2005 the KCLC joined a Seattle protest against the War in Iraq. This 5,000-strong protest mirrored a much larger protest in Washington D.C. on September 24, 2005. The nation's capitol protest included tens of thousands of anti-war activists. In 2005 the KCLC changed its name to the \\"Martin Luther King, Jr. County Labor Council\\" (MLKCLC). In 2006 the MLKCLC elected the current Executive Secretary, David Freiboth, who formerly served as the national president of the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific for 12 years and had served as the Maritime Trades representative to the MLKCLC Executive Board. Prior executive secretary, Steve Williamson left the council to join United Food and Commercial Workers Local 21. The MLKCLC's 2006 Labor Day picnic was covered by Seattle P-I reporter who interviewed labor leaders on the declining membership of unions, not only nationwide, but statewide, as well. Although 19% of Washington's workforce is unionized, across the nation only 12.5% of workers belong to a union. Labor leaders expressed a need for the renewal of organized labor tactics. In 2009 the MLKCLC supported the Metropolitan King County Council's decision to enact a \\"don’t ask\\" immigration law that prevents illegal immigrants from being forced to tell their immigration status when seeking public-health services or when dealing with sheriff's deputies. The King County Council said it was to discourage racial profiling and decrease the fear of seeking health care. On June 17, 2020, MLKCLC delegates voted to expel the Seattle Police Officers Guild from the organization.  References  = Print sources = *AFL-CIO, King County Labor Council of Washington. Guide.

He is associated with the Shakta tradition and viewed as a perfect spiritual master of tantra, gyan, yoga and prema or bhakti. His followers idealized him as their worshipped and beloved thakura. Nigamananda was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in the hamlet of Kutabpur in Nadia district (at present Meherpur district Bangladesh). He was a sannyasi from Adi Shankar's dashanami sampradaya. After his ordination as a sannyasi, he came to be known as Paribrajakacharya Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Deva. Nigamananda achieved siddhi (perfection) in four different sadhanas (spiritual disciplines): tantra, gyan, yoga and prema. Based on these experiences, he wrote five Bengali language books: Brahamcharya Sadhana (ब्रह्मचर्य साधन), Yogi Guru (योगिगुरु), Gyani Guru (ज्ञानीगुरु), Tantrika Guru (तांत्रिकगुरु), and Premik Guru (प्रेमिकगुरु).List of Books-Page:102, Brahamcharya Sadhana, Yogi Guru, Gyani Guru, Tantrika Guru, Premika Guru, (Ami ki Chai) at Religious movements in modern Bengal By Benoy Gopal Ray Visva- Bharati, 1965Premika Guru, Bangla 4th Edition By West Bengal Public Library Network Nigamananda reportedly experienced the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. After retiring from Saraswata Matha, Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in Puri. Durga Charan Mohanty, a school student, met him at Nilachala Kutir in 1930 and recognized him as sadguru. Mohanty became Nigamananda's disciple and wrote books for Nigamananda's establishment Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and translated Nigamananda's Bengali books into Odia. Under Mohanty's encouragement, more than 100 ashrams operate in Odisha. Mohanty continued to spread the message of Nigamananda until his death on 7 December 1985.  Life  = Childhood, studies and service life (1880–1901) = कुतबपुर-Kutabpur(Gurudham), the birthplace of Swami Nigamananda in dist. Nadia At his birth, Nigamananda was named Nalinikanta (নলিনীকান্ত, ନଳିନୀକାନ୍ତ, नलिनीकान्त - in Hindu meaning is: Lotus, water), per the wishes of his father, Bhuban Mohan and the advice of his father's guru, Swami Bhaskarananda Saraswati. At the age of thirteen (1893) Nalinikanta lost his mother Manikya Sundari Devi to cholera, pushing him into depression. In 1894-95 he passed the student scholarship examination and studied at Meherpur High School. In 1895 he entered Dhaka Asanulla Engineering College. In 1897 his father married him to a thirteen-year-old girl named Sudhansubala Devi of Halisahar. He completed his study in 1899 and joined a service in the District Board of Dinajpur, the estate of Rani Rashmoni. At the end of Vadra, 1901 (approximately five years after marriage) when he was serving as the supervisor of the Narayanpur Estate (Zamindari), Nalinikanta saw the shadowy image of his wife standing at the table glowering and silent while she was away at Kutabpur (Nalinikanta's village). He went to Kutabpur to inquire and learned that she had died just an hour before his vision. He unsuccessfully attempted to reach his wife through occult science. = Turning point = Until he lost his wife, Nalinikanta had seen death as the ultimate end. Losing her led him to believe that there must be life after death. Nalinikanta became obsessed with this question. His inquiry took him to Madras (now Chennai) to study theosophy at the Theosophical Society at Adyar. Through a medium, he was able to talk to his wife, but remained unsatisfied. His discussions at the society led him to search for a yogi who could fulfill his desire to meet his dead wife and educate him in the true philosophy of \\"life after death\\". = Spiritual experience (1902–1905) = \\"Nalinikanta\\" took to asceticism and named after Nigamananda in 1904 (on the 11th Vadra in 1309 BS) One night Nalinikanta dreamed of a sadhu with a brilliant aura. He woke up to find the sadhu standing beside his bed. The sadhu handed him a bael leaf with a mantra written on it and then vanished. Nalinikanta asked many to help him understand its meaning. Finally he met Bamakhepa, a famous tantrik of Tarapith, Birbhum district. Nalinikanta took initiation (dikhshya) from Bamakhepa and was directed to chant his mantra for 21 days. Under Bamakhepa's guidance he had physical darshan of Tara Devi in the form of his wife. This darshan led him to another mystery. He saw Tara Devi coming out of his body and mingling with him. To solve this mystery, Bamakshepa advised Nalinikanta to attain the knowledge of Advaita from a vedantic guru. In 1902 he searched for a jnani guru. He met guru Satchidananda Saraswati at the holy place of Pushkar in the Indian state of Rajasthan. He realized that Satchidananda Saraswati was the sadhu who had given him the Tara mantra in his dream. Nalinikanta became his disciple, and learned the theories of Brahma (god as the formless one), Brahma sutras and vedanta. He was initiated by the Satchidananda into renunciation and according to that principle changed his name to Nigamananda.Religious movements in modern Bengal Author-Benoy Gopal Ray, Visva-Bharati, 1965,His name was changed to \\"Nigamananda\\" .... Page -101 Satchidananda directed Nigamananda to undertake pilgrimages to the four institutions (Char Dham) of religious seats and realize for himself the significance of each, as the Hindus held these places of worship sacred.Mahadham Orissa Review, June 2006 By Govt. of Orissa After these pilgrimages, he returned to the ashram. On his arrival at the ashram, Sachidananda reviewed Nigamananda's pilgrimages and said: \\"My boy! You have travelled widely and seen the religious places and acquired knowledge and experience. All that I had to teach you has been accomplished but it is for you now to put my teachings into practice. You have to experience for yourself the truth of your being and this can only be done through concerted efforts as well as the practice and observance of yogic principles. Thus you now have to seek out a guru who will provide you the proper guidance in this line. Gauhati(Assam)-Kamakhya Hill: This is the place, where Nigamananda experienced Nirivikalpa Samadhi (निर्बिकल्प समाधि)and the place is identified by government of Assam in 2012.Seven Sisters Post - Swami Nigamananda's Nirbikalpa Sidhia Sthal(निर्विकल्प सिद्धि श्थल )at Guwahati identified. Again Nigamananda went out to seek a guru. In 1903 he met a \\"yogi guru\\" (yoga master) - whom he called \\"Sumeru Dasji\\" (otherwise known as Koot Hoomi Lal Singh or Kuthumi). Nigamananda was accepted as his disciple. Under Das's guidance he learned yoga.Religious movements in modern Bengal Author- Benoy Gopal Ray, Visva-Bharati, 1965,After continuous search he found a Yogi Guru Sumeru Das ji.... Page -101 After hard practice, in the month of Poush 1904, Nigamananda was able to master Savikalpa samadhi (the trance in which the yogi loses his body consciousness and acquires a transcendental consciousness while retaining his individual identity). Soon after Nigamananda desired to experience the state of Nirvikalpa - the most advanced of yogic samadhis at Kamakshya, Guwahati Assam (Nilachal Hill). Nigamananda followers believe that he did enter by way of this samadhi and was returned into his body with the residual consciousness of \\"I am the master or guru\\" and in yoga he had visualized and practically understood in his own body his guru's vedic knowledge. (The place \\"Nirvikalpa samadhi\\" experienced by Swami Nigamananda has been identified. Assam Governor Janaki Ballav Patnaik inaugurated the Nirbikalpa Sidhi Sthal of Swami Nigamananda at Nilachal Hills in Kamakhya Dham, Guwahati on 20 December 2012.The Times of India - Swami Nigamananda's Nirbikalpa Sidhia Sthal(निर्विकल्प सिद्धि श्थल )at Guwahati identified.The Assam Tribune - Swami Nigamananda's Nirbikalpa Sidhia Sthal(निर्विकल्प सिद्धि श्थल )at Guwahati identified.) In 1904, he was in Kashi (now known as Varanasi), when goddess Annapurna appeared in another dream and told him that his knowledge was limited to formless god and not gone beyond that, hence he was still incomplete. He accepted her challenge and traveled to Gouri devi (a siddha yogini) to learn bhava sadhana. Gouri devi accepted him as disciple and taught him bhakti or prem (eternal nature of divine love play) to understand the physical world as the transformation of god in bhava sadhana. Nigamananda's long and continued search for his guru, resembled the search undertaken by his future disciples to find him.Stories By Sri Chinmoy = Recognition as paramahansa (1904) = In 1904 Nigamananda went to Allahabad to see kumbha mela and learned that his master Sachidandand was in the area, staying with Sankaracarya of Sringeri Matha. He found Sankaracarya (mahant or superior) sitting on an elevated throne surrounded by 125 monks, including his guru. Seeing him, Nigamananda went first to pay his respects to his guru, and then to the higher-ranking mahant. The sadhu were upset by this perceived disrespect in not honoring the \\"mahant\\" first, but in response Nigamananda quoted the scripture: \\"Mannatha shri jagannatha madguru shri jagadguru madatma sarvabhutatma tasmai shri gurave namaha (मन्नाथ श्री जगन्नाथ मदगुरु श्री जगदगुरु मदात्मा सर्वभूतात्मा तस्मै श्री गुरवे नमः)\\", meaning, \\"My guru is highest in whole world, hence I should respect my guru first\\". Nigamananda further explained to the sadhu assemblies that \\"on the basis of the vedanta philosophy there was no difference between his 'Guru' (Shri Sachidanand Saraswati) and 'Jagadguru' (Shri Shankarcharya)\\". Jagadguru Sankaracarya endorsed this response and recognized Nigamananda as one who had achieved spiritual enlightenment. Jagadguru conferred him with the title \\"paramahansa\\" and came to known as \\"Paribrajakacharay Paramahansa Shree Mad Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Deva\\" (परिब्राजकचार्य परमहंस श्री मद स्वामी निगमानंद सरस्वती देव).Shree Shree Thakur Nigamananda-Oriya Jeevani, See-\\"KUMBHA MELA\\" Writer: Durgacharan Mohanty, Banmali Das, Nilanchala Saraswata Sangha, Puri = Death (1935) = Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in Puri. He died in Calcutta on 29 November 1935. Nigamananda's followers honor his memory, and gather at annual congregations (sammilani), and other ceremonial occasions. His ashram at Halisahar,Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math and Cemetery of Swami Nigamananda Saraswata Matha (previously Shanti Ashram) in Jorhat and Sundarbans are places of pilgrimage.  Mission  Nigamananda's mission was to propagate sanatana dharma (सनातन धर्म), the spiritual foundation of the Hindu religion, to spread the \\"right kind of education\\" (सत् शिक्षा बिश्तार) among people, to publish spiritual literature with emphasis on character building and to provide \\"service to all created beings\\" (नर देहे नारायण सेवा), with the attitude of serving the indwelling God. In order to realize these objectives he enjoined his devotees to \\"lead an ideal family life\\" (आदर्श गृहस्थ जीवन गठन), to combine the power of spiritual associations (संघ शक्ति प्रतिष्ठा) and \\"to share or exchange spiritual feelings among the disciples\\" (भाव बिनिमय).Religious movements in modern Bengal Author-Benoy Gopal Ray, Visva-Bharati, 1965,Ideals, Lead an ideal householder's life. Nigamananda laid great stress on the spirit of unity and co-operation(combined power, shangha shakti).... Page 101  Jayaguru (जयगुरु ଜୟଗୁରୁ জয়গুরু)  To achieve the above objectives, he initiated thousands of interested men and women of all walks of life and taught them his spiritual practices. They were devoid of sectarian bias in that they did not provide a complete package of worship, prayer and meditation. He encouraged his disciples to meet periodically in groups (sangha) of three or more to offer prayer and worship to the guru, to exchange spiritual experiences and to chant \\"jayaguru\\" (जयगुरु ଜୟଗୁରୁ), a non-sectarian word he invented, meaning \\"Glory of, by, and for the Master\\". He instructed them to read spiritual books and devise ways and means for managing matha and ashrams and pledging to lead the life of a spiritually inspired ideal householder. He advised his disciples that the glory of God or Guru is experienced through the medium of the word \\"jayaguru\\". One can reach at God through this name since God is the Guru or Master of the Universe. People belonging to any sect or creed can accept this name without any risk to their progress in the religious life.An article published in www.geocities.com from Swami Chetanananda Saraswati  Philosophy and teachings  Krishna had told Arjuna about the relationship between Guru and God during the course of His teaching. He had used the word \\"AHAM\\" when He meant Himself as Guru and \\"TAT\\" when He meant God. He mentioned God in the following verses: tat- prasadat param santim sthanam prapsyasi sasvatam (Bhagvad Gita 18.62). Nigamananda was a sanyasi of the Adi Shankara cult. He studied vedanta philosophy due to Shankaracharya after he was initiated as a sanyasi of that order. Nigamananda's core-teachings were that guru and istha are identical and that disciples should adopt ideals of Lord Shankar (i.e. the principles of gyan) and ideals of Lord Gaurang (i.e. the path of bhakti). He indicated that Shankar's disciplines were difficult and that Lord Gaurang offered an easier path. According to Nigamananda, Shankar and Gaurang provide a sweet combination of Gyan and Bhakti to lead the world in the right way. Nigamananda's philosophy and teachings as per Chetanananda Saraswati are explained here: = Avatar and Sadguru = Nigamananda never admitted that he was God-incarnate or an Avatar (अवतार) although many disciples fancied him as one. He stated that an incarnation is an exclusive descent of God on earth to uphold spiritual order. Although he could, the Avatar ordinarily does not enlighten or guide individuals. Through his agency righteousness is established and demonic forces are destroyed. Nigamananda wanted to be treated as a Sadguru (a perfect spiritual Master) who, on account of his quest over a succession of births and deaths, attained the knowledge of his Swaroop स्वरुप (true or potential nature, i.e., supreme universal consciousness). Scriptural evidence shows that Gautam himself had to pass through many births before realising the truth and becoming the Buddha. Nigamananda further pointed out that an Avatar does not always remain in the state allowing leela (divine play.)Nobody should call me an Avatar collection at srichinmoylibrary.com = Sadguru, Jagadguru and God = According to Nigamananda the disciple should take his Guru to be the Jagadguru (or the World Master, the Purushottama) and not an ordinary human being, in tune with Krishna's statement in the Bhagavadgeeta: > Patanjali's aphorism expands this idea: \\"By contemplating on the form of one > who has no attachments, concentration of mind is attained\\", Nigamananda > advised his disciples to meditate on his physical form such that all the > admirable qualities and attributes in him would get automatically > transferred into their beings and fashion their souls. Further he assured > that because he had, by employing three modes of spiritual practice, > simultaneously experienced the nature of Brahman (ब्रह्म), Paramatma > (परमात्मा) (supreme universal self) and Bhagawan (भगवान) (personal and > universal Godhead.) He proclaimed that his disciples would simultaneously > have such an experience. That, he said, \\"was his only expectation from his > disciples and he would love to wait for the day to see that fulfilled\\". = > Order of Spiritual Attainments = According to Nigamananda, the theory of > self-realization requires expanding the individual self to the status of the > supreme universal self. The expansions can be directly practiced only by the > most competent among the aspirant samyasis by means of precise intellectual > inquiry, analysis and deep meditation, although service to the Master is the > key to success in such pursuits as well.Swami Nigamananda's JIVANMUKTA > UPASANA (realisation of truth or liberation in the present life)THEORY, > Book: Sadguru Swami Nigamananda (Page:207) By NSS Puri (India).

Nigamananda pointed out that the path > shown by Gauranga, who practiced and preached unconditional devotion and > love for God, was rather narrow, inasmuch as it was directed to Sri Krishna > as the only God. In order to broaden that path, Nigamananda suggested taking > the master as an embodiment of Sri Krishna (or any other deity whom the > aspirant loved), in which case the guide himself becomes the goal. In this > way Nigamananda convincingly reconciled the two apparently contradictory > creeds of Shankaracharya and Gauranga who advocated the principle and > practice of apparent duality between the devotee and God. After all, > Nigamananda pointed out that in the path of devotion and love the aspirant > has to subdue or tame his ego adequately and hence he attains to the same > stage as that of the monastic aspirant whose ego loses its identity on > attaining to his goal. In the former case, the devotee's individuality is > reduced to a trifle, overpowered by personal god-consciousness, whereas in > the latter the aspirant loses his self-consciousness in the ocean of > impersonal universal consciousness. ; Jnanachakra Nigamananda pointed out > that although the doctrine of monastic vedanta philosophy treats the supreme > reality in terms of oneness of individual and universal consciousness, it > does not systematically explain the structure of the material creation that > is addressed by Samkhya philosophy. This latter does not treat the supreme > reality as well. Similarly, whereas Christianity emphasizes service and > surrender as means to God realization, the Indian philosophy of Poorva > Mimamsa prescribes various rituals for the attainment of personal and > collective happiness despite cycles of birth and death. By means of a > Jnanachakra (ज्ञानचक्र) chart (the spheres of spiritual cosmology) which he > presented in a pictorial form, Nigamananda identified different layers of > consciousness inter-woven in the microcosm (body) and the macrocosm (the > universe) and pointed out the levels that aspirants ultimately attain. In > this chart he placed Sri Krishna and Sri Radha (or the Guru-गुरु and > Yogamaya-योगमाया) in the transition between the non qualified (Nirguna) > Brahman (निर्गुण ब्रह्म) and qualified (Saguna) Brahman (सगुण ब्रह्म), which > he called Nitya or Bhavaloka (भाव लोक).

He who has attained the ultimate reality (Paramatman or > Brahman) as one and the same as himself (the Atman) is the Guru. * The Guru > cannot be equated in importance to formal learning, pilgrimage or divinity. > No other is more worthy of respect. * The Guru is the embodiment of what the > Vedanta teaches – the individual self (the Atman) is one and the same as the > cosmic self (Paramatman or Brahman). * A Sadguru never curses anyone. Even > his anger helps the disciple. The advantage of depending on a Sadguru is > unique and is superior to depending on God because God never materializes to > give instructions. * The Guru and the disciple are inseparable in a way. The > Guru cannot exist without being a part of a true disciple's personality or > character. * The two pathways to liberation are by initiation into and > observation of the austerities of sannyasa yoga or by service to a Sadguru. > The former is extremely arduous – the disciple must in a sense die. In other > words, he must lose body consciousness. But if one unconditionally loves the > Guru by way of rendering service to him sincerely, spiritual liberation may > be obtained relatively easily. * Nothing substantial can be achieved without > Guru's grace. * The mantra that Guru gives during initiation and the > disciple's chosen divinity (or Ista) are the same.

This new way to manage informal financial transactions has been enabled by advances in social media and peer-to-peer online platforms. The wide variety of collaborative finance resources may vary not only in their organizational and operational aspects, but also by geographical region, share of the financial market etc. It is precisely this heterogeneity that enables the informal savings and credit activity to profitably reach those income-groups not served by commercial banks and other financial institutions. It is their informality, adaptability and flexibility of operations – characteristics which reduce their transactions costs and confers upon them their comparative advantage and economic rationale. Collaborative Finance is characterized by highly personalized loan transactions entailing face-to-face dealings with borrowers and flexibility in respect of loan purpose, interest rates, collateral requirements, maturity periods and debt rescheduling. Following are the features of collaborative finance that make it attractive to low income households: * It does not require a license – most informal suppliers work without an operating license to supply money. * It is non-profit motivated – profit, if any, is ploughed back into the community and its members. * It has multiple proprietorship – proprietorship lies not with one or two persons, but the group as a whole. * It does not need collateral – collateral and guarantees of repayment is ensured by, for example, peer pressure. * It has specific borrowers identified – most of whom are members of the community. * It has close informational links – between members that ensure repayment. * It facilitates reciprocation of credit disbursal – there is a give-and-take attitude, where borrowers and lenders interchange their roles. * It is not regulated by the central bank – with respect to limits and restrictions, reporting requirements etc. * It encourages community participation in other fields of development – the participatory approach of informal initiatives is easily replicable to a wide range of other community development issues.

Williams, MacroWikinomics: rebooting business and the world, Portfolio Hardcover, 2010 Development =Rotating Saving Associations= A Rotating Savings and Credit Association or ROSCA is a group of individuals who agree to meet for a defined period of time in order to save and borrow together. \\"ROSCAs are the poor man's bank, where money is not idle for long but changes hands rapidly, satisfying both consumption and production needs.\\"F.J.A. Bouman, Indigenous savings & credit societies in the developing world in Von Pischke, Adams & Donald (eds.) Rural Financial Markets in the Developing World World Bank, Washington, 1983 Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are essentially a group of individuals who come together and make regular cyclical contributions to a common fund, which is then given as a lump sum to one member in each cycle. For example, a group of 12 persons may contribute US$35 per month for 12 months. The US$420 collected each month is given to one member. Thus, a member will lend' money to other members through his regular monthly contributions. After having received the lump sum amount when it is his turn (i.e. 'borrow' from the group), he then pays back the amount in regular/further monthly contributions. This explains the name rotating savings and credit associations' for such groups. Depending on the cycle in which a member receives his/her lump sum, members alternate between being lenders and borrowers. That is, there is a mutual give-and-take involved in ROSCAs. There is also a growing interest in peer-to-peer lending and neighbourhood service systems: rather than consumers renting services from businesses, platforms are emerging to facilitate shared usage with each other. =Collaborative lifestyles= This system is based on the sharing and exchange of resources and assets such as space, skills, time and money. Such a system, while on- trend and sensible, will further dampen demand for and purchase of new products making economic growth very difficult.

Background Although the film was made in 1994, it was not released until April 4, 2011, and played only in Russia. Despite its large budget and a well-known cast, the producers decided not to release it because they found the director's cut to be unacceptable. The soundtrack, recorded by Alfred Schnittke, was released on CD. When journalist Valeriy Kitshin of the Rossiyskaya Gazeta saw the film in a private screening at the Moscow International Film Festival in 2005, he tried to convince the producers to release it. However, Sergey Shilovsky, the grandson of Mikhail Bulgakov's third wife Elena Sergeevna, claimed to have the copyright on Bulgakov's literary inheritance, and asked for payment. Shilovsky eventually sold the rights to producer Scott Steindorff of Stone Village Productions, who commissioned Caroline Thompson to write the script. On November 15, 2010, the Russian film distributor Luxor announced that they had bought the rights to the film. It was on April 4, 2011. Luxor shortened the film to 118 minutes from the original director's cut, which was 240 minutes long. Copies are available on bootleg disks of low image quality. Plot The film is an adaptation of the novel The Master and Margarita by Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov. Three storylines are interwoven. The first is a satire of the 1930s, the period during which Joseph Stalin is in power in the Soviet Union. The devil Woland comes to Moscow to have his annual spring ball of the full moon. He and his companions challenge corrupt bureaucrats and profiteers. The second story, set in Jerusalem, describes the inner struggle of Pontius Pilate before, during, and after the conviction and execution of Jesus. The third part tells the love story between a nameless writer in Moscow in the 1930s and his lover, Margarita. He has written a novel on Pontius Pilate, a subject which was taboo in the officially anti-religious atheistic Soviet Union.

Fossils found in the Artois region of northern France were first described as Zosterophyllum artesianum, but a later review by Edwards showed that they did not fit the circumscription of that genus. Description Compressed fossils were found in the Artois region of northern France, in rocks which were originally thought to be of Pragian age (around ) but more recently have been considered to be probably of Emsian origin (around ). Plants consisted of smooth leafless stems (axes) up to 1.5 mm wide and were at least 85 mm high. They branched at right angles. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne on all sides, spaced irregularly on stalks up to 3 mm long which held them horizontally, and not forming a distinct 'spike'. Individual sporangia were elliptical in shape, around 3 mm wide by 2 mm high, splitting into two 'valves' along a line opposite to the stalks in order to release their spores. Since the sporangia were at right angles to the stem, the split was vertical. Taxonomy Specimens were first attributed to Zosterophyllum cf. myretonianum by Corsin in 1933. In 1956 Danzé-Corsin constructed a new species, Z. artesianum to accommodate this plant, arguing that it resembled Z. llanoveranum but had its sporangia arranged in a much laxer spike. Edwards notes that since then, reviews of the genus Zosterophyllum have clarified its circumscription. All species of Zosterophyllum have a compact spike of sporangia, arranged helically with some degree of regularity. The sporangia are bivalved as in this plant, but they have short stalks which turn upwards, so that the sporangia are vertically aligned and hence split (dehisce) along a horizontal line. No other genera within the zosterophylls has the features of the French specimens, so that Edwards assigned them to a new genus, Danziella, named after Danzé-Corsin. Phylogeny Edwards considers the placement of Danziella to be uncertain. It has a simpler organization than most of the genera assigned to the zosterophylls, somewhat resembling taxa such as Cooksonia caledonica and Renalia. Renalia is placed outside the zosterophylls as one of a set of sister taxa in the cladogram for the polysporangiophytes which Crane et al. published in 2004. Edwards agrees that Danziella may be part of the stem group of the zosterophylls and hence the lycophyte clade, but says that it could also belong elsewhere and show convergent evolution of the mechanism by which the sporangia split to release spores. Hao and Xue in 2013 listed the genus as a zosterophyll.

A formative figure in the history of the club was the journalist and radio broadcaster Alberto Damasceno, who was president of the club for 23 years before he passed on the office to his son Gian Paolo Damasceno in the mid of the first decade of the 2000s. The most remarkable player in the history of the club was José Ribamar de Oliveira \\"Canhoteiro\\", sometimes considered the left wing pendant to Garrincha. He played for América from 1949 until his move to São Paulo FC in 1953. Other modalities The basketball team of the club dominated in Ceará during the 1960s and won the state championships of 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966 and 1967. The futsal team was similarly dominant and won altogether eight state championships in the years 1957, 1958, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969.

Introduction SLinCA@Home is based at the G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics (IMP) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) in Kiev, Ukraine's capital city. It runs on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software platform, the SZTAKI Desktop Grid platform, and the Distributed Computing API (DC-API) by SZTAKI. SLinCA@Home hosts several scientific applications dedicated to research into scale-invariant dependencies in experimental data and computer simulation results. History The SLinCA@Home project was previously launched in January 2009 as part of the EGEE project in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for the funding of research and technological development in Europe. During 2009–2010 it used the power of a local IMP Desktop Grid (DG), but from December 2010 it has been using the power of volunteer-driven distributed computing in solving the computationally intensive problems involved in research into scale-invariant dependencies in experimentally obtained and simulated scientific data. It is now operated by a group of scientists from IMP NASU in close cooperation with partners from IDGF and the 'Ukraine' Distributed Computing team. From June 2010 SLinCA@Home has been under the framework of the DEGISCO FP7 EU project. Current status SLinCA@Home – last 4 weeks performance, as of March 16, 2011 Currently, SLinCA@Home is considered to be in alpha-test, due to gradual upgrades of the server and client parts. By informal statistics at the BOINCstats site (as of 16 March 2011), over 2,000 volunteers in 39 countries have participated in the project; it is the second most popular BOINC project in Ukraine (after the Magnetism@Home project, which is now inactive). About 700 active users contribute about 0.5–1.5 teraFLOPSSLinCA@Home Server Status of computational power, which would rank SLinCA@Home among the top 20 on the TOP500 list of supercomputers – if this were June 2005. Currently, one application (SLinCA) is running publicly using IMP Desktop Grid (DG) infrastructure (SLinCA@Home); three others (MultiScaleIVideoP, CPDynSG, and LAMMPS over DCI) are being tested internally at IMP. Scientific Applications The SLinCA@Home project was created to perform searches for and research into previously unknown scale-invariant dependencies using data from experiments and simulations. =Scaling Laws in Cluster Aggregation (SLinCA)= The SLinCA (Scaling Laws in Cluster Aggregation) application was the first one ported to the DG infrastructure by the Physics of Deformation Processes Lab at IMP NASU. Its goal is to find scale-invariant laws in kinetic scenarios of monomer aggregation in clusters of different kinds in multiple scientific domains. The processes of agent aggregation into clusters are investigated in many branches of science: defect aggregation in materials science, population dynamics in biology, city growth and evolution in sociology, etc. Experimental data exist confirming evolving structures, which tends to be hierarchical on many scales. The available theories give rise to many scenarios of cluster aggregation and the formation of hierarchical structures, and predict various scaling properties. However, there are huge databases of experimental data, which require powerful computational resources for hierarchical processing. A typical simulation of one cluster aggregation process with 106 monomers takes approximately 1–7 days on a single modern CPU, depending on the number of Monte Carlo steps (MCS). Deploying SLinCA on a Grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to undertake simulations on a larger scale and in a much shorter timeframe. Running the simulations and analysing the results on the Grid provides the required significant computational power. The technical characteristics of running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the SLinCA application based on the IMP Desktop Grid infrastructure (SLinCA@Home) are: * One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4 GHz) usually requires ~2–4 hours, less than 60 MB of memory, and less than 40 MB of hard drive space. * Checkpointing is not available, but is under test. * The timing of work-unit progress is nonlinear. SLinCA: Scientific Results The previous scientific results of the SLinCA application were obtained on EGEE computing resources at CETA- CIEMAT and XtremWeb-HEP Laboratoire de l'accélérateur linéaire test infrastructures were reported on March 29–30, 2009 during the poster session at the 4th EGEE training event and 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop, in Almere, Netherlands. SLinCA: Plans Current plans for the SLinCA application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make SLinCA from 50% to 200% faster. =Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiScaleIVideoP)= Optical microscopy is usually used for structural characterization of materials in a narrow range of magnification, a small region of interest (ROI), and without changes during microscopy. But many crucial processes of damage initiation and propagation take place dynamically in a timescale ranging from 10−3 s to 103 s and distance scales from micrometers (solitary defects places) to centimeters (for correlated linked networks of defects). Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiscaleIVideoP) is designed to process the recorded changes in materials under mechanical deformation in a loading machine (e.g., a diamond anvil cell). The calculations include many parameters of the physical process (e.g., rate, magnification, illumination conditions, and hardware filters) and image processing parameters (e.g., size distribution, anisotropy, localization, and scaling parameters); thus, the calculations are very slow, requiring more powerful computational resources. Deploying this application on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to perform image and video processing on a larger scale and in a much shorter timeframe. The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the MultiScaleIVideoP application at the IMP are: * One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4 GHz) usually requires ~20–30 minutes, less than 200 MB of memory, and less than 500 MB of hard drive space. * Checkpointing is not available, but is under test. * The timing of work-unit progress is linear. MultiScaleIVideoP: Scientific Results The scientific results of the MultiScaleIVideoP application were obtained on EGEE computing resources at CETA-CIEMAT and XtremWeb-HEP Laboratoire de l'accélérateur linéaire test infrastructures were reported on March 29–30, 2009 during the poster session at the 4th EGEE training event and 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop, in Almere, Netherlands. In January 2011, further scientific results for experiments on cyclic constrained tension of aluminum foils under video monitoring were reported. MultiScaleIVideoP: Plans Current plans for the MultiScaleIVideoP application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make MultiScaleIVideoP from 300% to 600% faster. =City Population Dynamics and Sustainable Growth (CPDynSG)= In the social sciences, it has been found that the growth of cities (or municipalities, lands, counties, etc.) can be explained by migration, merges, population growth, and similar phenomena. For example, from the literature one can found that the city population distribution in many countries is consistent with a power law form in which the exponent t is close to 2. This finding is confirmed qualitatively by data on the populations of various cities during their early histories. The population of essentially every major city grows much faster than each of their countries as a whole over a considerable timespan. However, as cities reach maturity, their growth may slow or their population may even decline for reasons unrelated to preferential migration to still-larger cities. Different theories give varying growth rates, asymptotics, and distributions of such populations. It is important to compare the various theories with each other, compare the theories with observations, and make predictions of possible population dynamics and sustainable growth for various subnational, national, and multinational regions. The City Population Dynamics and Sustainable Growth (CPDynSG) application allows investigating the correspondences between model predictions and the vast volume of available long-term historical data. The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the CPDynSG application at the IMP are: * One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4 GHz) usually requires ~20–30 minutes, less than 20 MB of memory, and less than 50 MB of hard drive space. * Checkpointing is not available, but is under test. * The timing of work-unit progress is linear. CPDynSG: Scientific Results In June–September 2010 some results from porting CPDynSG to the Distributed Computing Infrastructure (DCI) using BOINC and the SZTAKI Desktop Grid were obtained, specifically analyses of city size distributions in several Central and Eastern European countries. The distinctive isolation of the city size distribution in Hungary was noted. A very high similarity in the evolution of city size distributions in Ukraine and Poland was discovered. These results were reported during the Cracow Grid Workshop'10 (October 11–13, 2010) in oral and poster presentations. The poster presentation was awarded the \\"Best Poster of the Cracow Grid Workshop'10\\" prize. CPDynSG: Plans Current plans for the CPDynSG application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make CPDynSG from 50% to 200% faster. =Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) over DCI= One important topic in materials science currently is the development of new nanoscale functional devices. However, controlled fabrication of such requires careful selection and tuning of the critical parameters (e.g., elements, interaction potentials, and external influences such as temperature) of atomic self-organization in designed patterns and structures for nanoscale functional devices. Thus, molecular dynamics simulations of nanofabrication processes with brute-force searches through different combinations of parameters are of interest. For this, the very popular open-source package \\"Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator\\" (LAMMPS) by the Sandia National Laboratories was selected as a candidate for porting to DCI using the Desktop Grid. In other words, LAMMPS with \\"parameter sweeping\\" parallelism can be ported to DCI on DG. Usually, it requires powerful computational resources to simulate nano-objects with many parameters. The typical simulation of an investigated nanostructure under one set of physical parameters — for instance, a single crystal of metal (such as aluminium, copper, or molybdenum) with 107 atoms using embedded atom potentials for as little as 1–10 picoseconds of simulated physical process — takes approximately 1–7 days on a single modern CPU. Deploying LAMMPS on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to undertake the simulations in a wider range of physical parameter configurations and a much shorter timeframe. The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of LAMMPS at the IMP are: * One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4 GHz) usually requires ~2–48 hours, less than 500 MB of memory, and less than 1 GB of hard drive space. * Checkpointing is not available, but is under test. * The timing of work-unit progress is linear. LAMMPS over DCI: Scientific Results In September–October 2010 results were obtained and reported in an oral presentation during the International Conference on “Nanostructured materials-2010”, in Kiev, Ukraine. LAMMPS over DCI: Plans Current plans for the LAMMPS over DCI application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make LAMMPS over DCI from 300% to 500% faster. An additional goal is migration to the OurGrid platform for testing and demonstrating potential mechanisms of interoperation between worldwide communities with different DCI paradigms. The OurGrid platform is targeted at the support of peer-to-peer desktop grids; these are in nature very different from volunteer computing desktop grids such as the SZTAKI Desktop Grid. Partners SLinCA@Home collaborates with: * Partners in FP7 EU projects:  DEGISCO  EDGeS * Volunteer communities participating in distributed computing:  'Ukraine' Distributed Computing team * Professional communities of experts in distributed computing:  International Desktop Grid Federation (IDGF). Awards IDGF member Yuri Gordienko receives the 2nd best poster award at CGW'10 * 2009 – For the Best Poster of the Krakow Grid Workshop'09, Kraków, Poland (October 12–14, 2009) – the report on the concept and results of porting the MultiScaleIVideoP application with 4GL MATLAB-libraries to DCI on the basis of the BOINC SZTAKI Desktop Grid platform and the XtremWeb-HEP platform, in which the applicability of integrating MATLAB objects and code in a Desktop Grid for high-performance distributed computing is demonstrated on the example of image and video processing in solid state physics and microscopy. * 2010 – For the Best Poster of the Krakow Grid Workshop'10, Kraków, Poland (October 11–13, 2010) – the report on the concept and results of porting the CPDynSG application to DCI on the basis of the BOINC SZTAKI Desktop Grid platform, with comparisons of various theories' predictions with experimental observations, and typical scenarios of population dynamics and sustainable growth for different countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

The RC Graz Rugby Sevens team are the current Austrian 7s champions, as well as winning from 2013 to 2015 and finishing second in 2016. History The club was founded in 1995 following a rise in interest in rugby due to the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, which was the first rugby world cup to be shown on German-speaking free television. The same year, the club was initiated to the Austrian Rugby Federation (ÖRV) (now Rugby Österreich). While initially there were struggles to be able to consistently field 15 players, the team was able to compete in the B-Division of the Austrian League. They improved over several years and were crowned champions from 1999/2000 to 2001/02. While there has been some shifting in the league formats in the subsequent years, the team has mostly played at this level, winning the second division again in 2015 and even at times adequately competing at a higher level. The team also performed well in the Austrian Challenge Cup, winning three times, and has performed well in the Austrian 7s Championship, winning three times in a row from 2013 to 2015. In the short Autumn season in 2015, Graz was also the leading team in the ARC Championship Süd. The season was cut short due to a re-organisation of the Austrian league system, and due to this, no winner was crowned. In 2016, RC Graz ascended into the ARC Premiership once again to compete at the highest level of domestic rugby.

Members of the group are Kostya Leontovich (vocals, guitar), Michael Orlov (bass guitar), Danil Kalashnikov(drums). The group has developed a so- called \\"PICK-UP Sound\\" — a combination of many musical styles, heavy guitar sound and drive, decorated with beautiful electronic improvisations. In their songs the band raises themes of love, relationships, emotions, beliefs, and social problems. The name of the band is not just a combination of words, but the idea that their songs can lift the spirit of the people. In autumn 2009, they released the song \\"Bilshe Positiva\\" (More Positive), which hit the rotation of many radio stations in Ukraine, including Radio NRJ, and Europa Plus. In April 2010 the band signed with an American company iUA Music and releases EP \\"Closer\\" worldwide. While remaining an independent artist, PICK-UP organized something that is the epitome of creativity of each participant. History =Formation and early years (2005–2010)= PICK-UP was founded in 2005, consisting of Kostya Leontovich and his friend Alexey Ignatusha and Andrey Kropolnitsky, along with Sergei Pankratiev on drums. Title PICK-UP come spontaneously, when the boys had to write something on the booklet of their first concert. Before the end of 2007 the band managed to play at more than thirty Ukrainian festivals and concerts. But PICK-UP paved the way to fame on their own, and not everything was so cloudless: the group had to play in a small dirty clubs, to carry equipment on their shoulders and to go on tour by old trains at their own expense. Not all participants seen in this perspectives and at the end of 2007 the band remained with only 2 members Kostya Leontovich (vocals, guitar) and Alexey Ignatusha (bass). In 2008 the band PICK-UP took new musicians Alexandr Tarasov (drums), Taras Rudenko (piano) and recorded their debut EP titled \\"Closer\\". And this album was released only in 2010. But in September 2008, Kostya Leontovich temporarily left the band due to start of a new project, in this connection PICK-UP was frozen and musicians also quit the band. But at the end of this year, PICK-UP was recreated. Throughout 2009 the band played dozens of concerts with the new participants in the face of Valentin Oleinik, Nikita Rusakov, Vasya Dmitriev and Kostya Leontovich. But the views, especially on Christianity and development began to disperse. The year 2010 meant the time for change, Kostya Leontovich begins to engage in his solo career. But the thought of a successful rock band did not let him go. And he decided to invite a new musicians. Thus PICK-UP had cut its long journey of formation. New members Michael Orlov (bass guitar), Danil Kalashnikov (drums, back vocals) had been fully supported the idea of the group development, and after several months of rehearsals luck turned toward them. =Closer - EP (2010)= In 2010 the band signed with an American company iUA Music and released their first EP Closer which was recorded back in 2008 in their native Ukrainian language. All the tracks on this EP were composed by the band’s lead Kostya Leontovich (guitar/vocal). In an interview about the album, Kostya commented “love that can move the mountains, can save and bring heat in a heart - these are the main message and idea of the whole album. Extended plays “Closer” included four original songs and one bonus track of acoustic version of the main song “Bilshe Positive\\" (More Positive). PICK-UP was releasing an EP full of mix up which they use and spread out throughout the whole disc, modern rock sound, fascinating melodies, strong vocals and stunning lyrics, and their notable precise songs. =\\"Childhood Lost\\" (2011)= In autumn 2011, PICK-UP released the single \\"Childhood Lost\\" in English and in Ukrainian (\\"Bezpritulnyj Svit\\"). This song was devoted to the plight of homeless children and those suffering from broken homes. The lyrics of this song are particularly touching and the music is very powerful. \\"Weeping in silence, the only shelter is the sky....the rules of the street are the rules of push and shove, they teach us to fear and we forget that there is love.\\" The band called everyone to find the strength and courage from this song to lend a helping hand. =\\"Goodbye My Fear\\" (2012)= January 3, PICK-UP released a new single, entitled \\"Goodbye My Fear\\". This track talks about the renewal of the heart. The band's composer and lyricist, Kostya Leontovich, commented \\"only through faith is it possible to feel truly alive. And when your faith is strong, it is easy to forget about all of our fears. As St. Paul offered in his letter to the Romans 'If God is for us, who can be against us?' [Romans 8:31]. This same message of hope can be applied to all of life's problems, so this song was written as a message of encouragement to people.\\" In addition to releasing this single on iTunes and other digital store, PICK-UP shot a music video directed by Ekaterina Bereza. The video was filmed in just two days. The storyline was filmed in an art studio with the real Ukrainian artist at work, so the video had the present look and feel. =\\"The Acoustic Christmas EP\\" (2013)= During the New Year and Christmas holidays the band PICK-UP has prepared a special gift for all fans. 2 January 2013, the world saw the release \\"The Acoustic Christmas EP\\", which everyone could download for free from the official website of the band. The holiday EP album included three well-known songs of the group that were performed in an acoustic versions. =Реальність (2013)= PICK-UP demonstrated to the world a full-fledged debut album - \\"Реальність\\" - on May 20, 2013. The band worked in their own studio \\"Musicball\\" over the year to produce this album. The disc contains 12 tracks, including two instrumentals. The album was released on CDs, as well as digitally on iTunes and Google Play. By the way, the digital release of the album contains 3 additional bonus tracks. \\"We walked a long way for this album and for me,\\"Реальність\\"- is an example of honest hard work on the creation of PICK-UP's original sound,\\" commented the band’s lead Kostya Leontovich. - \\"Every song is a peculiar story with unique plot. We did not have much experience in studio recording, but we tried to find creative approaches to the quality and relevance of the material. So first of all, it's an honest album!\\" The first single from the album \\"Реальність\\" - the song \\"Дівчина З Голлівуду\\" - was presented at the beginning of May, and its music video, filmed by director Katerina Bereza, received airplay on Ukrainian music channels.

In the United States, governments have taken a number of legal and regulatory approaches to controlling NPS effluent. Nonpoint water pollution sources include, for example, leakage from underground storage tanks, storm water runoff, atmospheric deposition of contaminants, and golf course, agricultural, and forestry runoff. Nonpoint sources are the most significant single source of water pollution in the United States, accounting for almost half of all water pollution, and agricultural runoff is the single largest source of nonpoint source water pollution. This water pollution has a number of detrimental effects on human health and the environment. Unlike point source pollution, nonpoint source pollution arises from numerous and diverse sources, making identification, monitoring, and regulation more complex. Basis for controls and regulations The basis for nonpoint source pollution regulation is the negative direct and indirect effects on both human health and the environment caused by the pollutants in NPS effluent. =Human health= Human health is most directly affected when polluted water is ingested into the body. Nonpoint source pollution can often have toxic contaminants and chemicals present in the water. Additionally, there can be both bacteria and viruses (aka pathogens) found in the water. Toxic contaminants and chemicals Effluent from nonpoint sources may include toxic contaminates and chemical compounds including heavy metals like lead, mercury, zinc, and cadmium, organics like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other substances resistant to breakdown.Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. \\"Nonpoint Source Pollution.\\" . There are many health effects associated with many of these toxic substances. *Lead – can cause damage to the nervous connections as well as blood and brain disorders. Specific diseases include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and anemia. *Mercury – Studies have shown effects such as chronic effects including tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbances. Acute exposure has shown to cause chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of damage to the lung tissue. *Zinc – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, which can cause loss of the sense of smell. Additionally, zinc toxicosis can occur in high doses of zinc. *Cadmium – Exposure to cadmium-containing substances can result initially in metal fume fever but can progress to chemical lung damage, pulmonary edema, and even death. *PCBs – People exposed to high levels of PCBs can exhibit skin conditions, such as rashes and liver damage. Common symptoms include dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses.Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo...[Environ Res. 2001]  PubMed ResultPCB Baby Studies Part 2 Other symptoms include fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. *PAHs – The EPA has classified seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. Pathogens Pathogens are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include: * Cryptosporidium parvum – Primary symptoms of C. parvum infection are diarrhoea. Other symptoms can include anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain.\\"Cryptosporidiosis.\\" Laboratory Identification of Parasites of Public Health Concern. CDC. 5 Sept 2007. * Giardia lamblia – Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, malaise, excessive gas, steatorrhoea, epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diminished interest in food, and weight loss. * Salmonella – Symptoms are usually gastrointestinal. This can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea with mucus, headache, and fatigue. * Parasitic worms (helminths) – Conditions associated with intestinal helminth infection include intestinal obstruction, insomnia, vomiting, weakness, and stomach pains. =Environment= The environment is impacted by nonpoint source pollution through the input of sediment and nutrients from multiple sources directly into the water system. Toxic contaminants and chemicals Toxic chemicals and contaminants, like motor oil, fuel, and industrial facility waste can enter the water system by storm water runoff. These chemicals, many of which can contain heavy metals, can enter the water system and coat the species present in the water.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Washington D.C. \\"Nonpoint Source Pollution\\" September 2007. This can lead to death of the aquatic organisms which can cause increases in the amount of nutrients in the system from the decaying animals. Sediment Sediment or suspended sediment in the water is soil that would not normally be present in the water column. When the sediment is suspended up in the water column, it blocks out the sunlight which is needed by bottom dwelling plants. If these plants, called submerged aquatic vegetation, are deprived of sunlight for a significant amount of time, they will die. These plants are a significant source of food for many aquatic organisms as well as trap oxygen and sediment. When there is an excess of dying plants in an aquatic ecosystem, it can lead to eutophic or hypoxic conditions in the water body. Nutrients The primary nutrients found in water due to nonpoint source pollution are nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers. An influx of these nutrients can lead to eutrophication within the water. This is when there is an excess of nutrients in water, thus leading to an explosion in the growth of algae. The algae can cover the lake and block sunlight from reaching the organisms below, typically killing them. Legal framework NPS water pollution is regulated at the federal, state, and local level. Yet, the pollution persists and remains a significant problem. There are a number of reasons why current regulations have failed to stem the flow of pollution. NPS water pollution comes from numerous and diverse sources, and control measures are expensive to implement. Also, local governments are generally responsible for implementing NPS regulations. Coordination among localities can be difficult, and, furthermore, localities often lack the incentive to rigorously enforce NPS regulations because their NPS pollution is exported downriver, where other towns and cities must deal with the consequences. This section will introduce the laws currently in place at the federal, state, and local level that regulate NPS water pollution. It will also discuss some of the successes and failures of those regulations. =Federal laws= There are two principal federal laws effecting NPS water pollution: the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act. In addition, EPA's \\"Clean Water Action Plan\\" (2009) outlines a strategy for enforcing CWA requirements, some of which are applicable to nonpoint sources. Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act (CWA) was the first federal law designed to directly address water pollution. The CWA has been amended many times, but the 1972 amendments provide the core statutory basis for the regulation of point source water pollution and created the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program. The 1972 amendments were also the first instance where Congress acknowledged the problem of NPS water pollution by requiring the states to prepare areawide water quality management plans under Section 208.CWA section 208. Areawide Waste Treatment Management. Congress passed additional amendments to the CWA in 1987 that address NPS water pollution. This section will chronologically address the parts of the CWA that regulate NPS water pollution. =Defining NPS water pollution in the CWA= The definition of NPS water pollution is open to interpretation. However, federal regulation under the CWA provides a specific legal definition for the term. A \\"nonpoint source\\" is defined as any source of water pollution that is not a \\"point source\\" as defined in section 502(14) of the Clean Water Act. That definition states: \\"The term 'point source' means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged. This term does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.\\" There are important differences between point source pollution and NPS pollution. There are many more nonpoint sources than there are point sources, and they are more discrete than nonpoint sources. Furthermore, nonpoint source discharges are not always easily observed, and monitoring nonpoint pollution can be costly. Another difference is that NPS pollution will vary over time and space based on different weather and geographic conditions. All the above factors make nonpoint pollution more difficult to regulate than point sources. =Section 208= Section 208 was Congress' first attempt to address NPS water pollution, and it directed states and local governments to create management plans that identified future waste treatment needs and identify and control NPS water pollution. The section notes that any areawide management plan must discuss how to identify \\"agriculturally and silviculturally related nonpoint sources of pollution,\\" and \\"runoff from manure disposal areas, and from land used for livestock and crop production.\\" Section 208 is in essence a federal funding mechanism for state programs that attempt to control NPS pollution, but its meager funding was completely used up by 1980. Section 208 was widely considered a failure because it did little to actually reduce NPS pollution. It created a voluntary provision that directs states to study whether regulatory controls are needed. The law left decisions to the states about whether to regulate NPS water pollution. There was no process or mechanism to develop standards or enforce them. =Section 319= After section 208's failure to control NPS water pollution, in 1987 Congress passed the Water Quality Act which included a new section 319 to address the problem of nonpoint sources.CWA section 319. Nonpoint source management programs. This provision, also non-regulatory, authorizes EPA to fund demonstration programs and provide technical assistance to state and local governments. Some critics have argued that section 319 provides little improvement over section 208. The section requires states to identify water bodies that cannot meet water-quality standards without control of nonpoint sources. The states must then identify best management practices and measures for those impaired sources, along with an implementation plan. The EPA approves these plans, and if a state fails to develop a plan, the EPA must do so for the state. However, there are a number of problems with these provisions. Funding to develop the plans has been scarce. The section does not actually place limits on NPS pollution, and states are not even required implement the plans they create. Another problem with 319 (and 208) is that there is no enforcement mechanism In the case Natural Resource Defense Council v. EPA, 915 F.2d 1314, 1318 (9th Cir. 1990), the court held that \\"Section 319 does not require states to penalize nonpoint source polluters who fail to adopt best management practices; rather it provides for grants to encourage the adoption of such practices.\\" =Section 404= Section 404 of the CWA requires that a permit be obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the \\"discharge of dredged and fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.\\"CWA section 404(a). The 404 permit process is frequently used to protect wetlands, which are essential to the control of nonpoint pollution because they slow the rate of surface water runoff and remove sediment and other pollutants before they reach lakes and streams. While these permitting procedures may result in decreased NPS water pollution to wetlands, developers may simply relocate to an alternative location and still cause the release of NPS water pollution. =Total maximum daily loads= CWA section 303(d)(1)(C) requires states to identify waterbodies that do not meet water quality standards after application of the technology- based standards for point source pollution. States must then establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for those water bodies to bring them into compliance with water quality standards. The standards are submitted to EPA for approval. As TMDLs are looking at the total amount of loading, this by definition includes nonpoint sources, so if nonpoint sources are impairing a body of water, the TMDL would have to address a way to reduce those nonpoint sources. TMDLs are required even if a body of water fails to meet quality standards entirely due to nonpoint sources.Pronsolinoz v. Nastri, 291 F.3d 1123 (9th Cir. 2002) =Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations= Depending on the number of animals at a particular site, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) may generate significant amounts of manure. One method to remove the manure is to apply it to land for fertilization. However, in an effort to dispose of manure at a reduced costs, some CAFOs have applied excess amounts of manure to land areas. The excess amounts of manure may then be washed away by rain into surface waters. This practice was a key feature in the U.S. Court of Appeals case Waterkeeper Alliance, et al. v. EPA, 399 F.3d 486 (2d Cir. 2005). Based on that case, the EPA created its 2008 CAFO Rule. The Rule notes that the CWA specifically exempts agricultural storm water runoff from being considered a point source, but, based on the Court of Appeals' decision in the Waterkeeper case, the EPA may treat land applications of excessive amounts of manure as a point source. So while in general agricultural storm water runoff from CAFOs is a nonpoint source, CAFOs may end up requiring a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit under the CWA. Clean Water Action Plans There have been two \\"Clean Water Action Plans\\" offered by federal authorities that would affect NPS water pollution. They are both executive orders, not legislation from Congress. The first was issued by President Bill Clinton in 1998. The second, and more recent strategy was issued by Obama Administration in 2009. Both plans provided funding and guidance to address NPS water pollution. Coastal Zone Management Act The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was passed in 1972 and provides for the management of the nation's coast lands and the Great Lakes. When Congress reauthorized the CZMA in 1990, it identified NPS water pollution as a significant factor in the degradation of coastal waters. To address NPS water pollution in coastal areas, the 1990 amendments to the CZMA created the Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants (CZEG) Program. The states must submit information on their programs to the Secretary of Commerce and the EPA Administrator, who are in charge of approving the plan. The plan is to be implemented in conjunction with the states NPS water pollution plan under section 319 of the CWA and through changes in the overall coastal zone management program. If a state does not submit an approved program, the state may lose a percentage of the grant money provided under the CZMA and under section 319 of the CWA. The EPA is also to provide some guidance to states in developing their NPS coastal management plans through the publication of national guidelines on management measures. These management measures must be economically achievable for new and existing NPS water pollution and must reduce pollution to the greatest extent achievable through the current best management practices. =State & local laws= States have primary responsibility for implementing NPS water pollution regulations. Both the CZMA and the CWA direct the states to draft and implement NPS plans, and the federal government plays a limited role. As noted in the previous section on federal regulations, the CWA and CZMA provide financing for states to implement NPS programs, and those NPS programs have taken a variety of forms. The majority of state plans rely on education and technical assistance, including the development of best management practices, to reduce NPS water pollution. Local governments also have an important role to play in NPS regulation. Local municipality, water conservation districts and other entities with land management responsibility provide planning, zoning, and technical and informational assistance to control NPS pollution. While the approaches states and local governments have taken to regulating NPS water pollution are perhaps too numerous to count, a survey of a few state approaches can provide insight on common NPS implementation plans. Indiana Indiana uses a common approach to address NPS pollution known as the watershed approach. A watershed includes \\"the total geographic area that drains storm water (and pollutants) to a particular stream, lake, aquifer, or other water body.\\" The watershed approach to addressing NPS water pollution attempts to address all the relevant water bodies holistically in the context of their watershed while also considering all the potential sources of pollution within a watershed. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) was required under section 303(d) of the CWA to create a list of impaired waters for which TMDLs would be required. IDEM's NPS and watershed efforts concentrate on these impaired water resources. Implementation of TMDLs is managed by local watershed organizations, and NPS pollution controls are only voluntary. Watershed groups use funding from IDEM to create incentive programs for the use of best management practices, as well as provide public information and education. Funding sources for NPS pollution regulation in Indiana include CWA 319(h) grants; CWA 205(j) grants; grants from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; and a wide variety of foundations and individual fundraising. Zoning ordinances may also be structured in a way that limits NPS water pollution. California California's NPS plan requires coordination from 28 different state agencies, which reveals the institutional challenges NPS regulation may encounter. The State Water Resources Control Board's Division of Water Quality and the California Coastal Commission (CCC), designed California's NPS plan pursuant to the CWA and the Federal Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. California's NPS plan for 1998–2013 is available here: http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/nps/docs/planvol1.pdf. The plan notes that California, like Indiana, uses a watershed management approach to controlling NPS pollution. The plan began by identifying roughly 1,500 water body-pollutant combinations that would require a TMDL under the CWA section 303(d). The plan takes a three tiered approach to implement management measures for NPS pollution. The first tier considers \\"self-determined implementation of best management practices.\\" This essentially considers voluntary programs, grants, and education. California has a number of educational programs designed to help alert local policymakers to the problems associated with NPS pollution, including the California Water and Land Use Partnership and the Model Urban Runoff Program. Incentive programs under this tier include measure like financial assistance for local watershed stewardship projects through grants from the CWA section 319 and environmental quality incentives programs for implementation cost-sharing. The first tier is less stringent than tiers two or three. The second tier of the plan is called the \\"regulatory-based encouragement of management practices.\\" The second tier essentially works by allowing polluters to adopt certain managements measures that discourage NPS pollution rather than go through various permitting procedures. Regional water quality control boards may work with landowners and resource managers to waive the adoption of waste discharge requirements (WDRs), a type of effluent limitation, if a polluter adopts certain BMPs. The third tier is called \\"effluent limitations and enforcement.\\" The effluent limitations may be set at a level where the only realistic manner of compliance is the adoption of BMPs. These limitations are command and control requirements for some activities, including for example WDRs for commercial nurseries, WDRs for selenium for the San Joaquin River, permitted storm water programs, erosion Control for Lake Tahoe, and WDRs for dairies. A number of these regulations are derived from California's Porter-Cologne Act, which established the State Water Resources Control Board, along with nine regional boards that are tasked with implementing the Porter Cologne Act. The Act created state water quality standards that the boards must enforce. WDRs are one direct regulation California government agencies use under the Act to regulate NPS pollution. California has a number of other pieces of legislation that address NPS pollution, like the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. Policy instruments and regulatory approaches There are five primary stakeholders involved in NPS water pollution regulation: government agencies, environmental advocacy groups, potentially regulated entities, and the public. Government stakeholders are government agencies responsible for regulating NPS pollution. In addition to scientific results, agencies are concerned with how new regulations may influence their funding. Environmental advocacy stakeholders are organizations that aim to solve environmental problems, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council. These groups focus on the involvement of concerned citizens. The potentially regulated entities are the industries that will be regulated under new regulation.Policy Options for Addressing Nonpoint Source Surface Water Pollution.2009. The public is a key stackholder group, and various measures have been taken to engage the public on NPS water pollution, including the publication of citizen handbooks on NPS water pollution and online information. Environmental regulations for nonpoint sources must be expressed in directives that are specifically understandable by the regulatory target and enforceable by subsequent government intervention. The legal section above noted a number of policy options that have been used for regulating NPS water pollution. Some of the options include: volunteerism, command and control regulations, incentive based instruments, design standards, emissions limits, product bans, trading systems, subsidies, liability rules, and other options. =Volunteerism= Volunteerism mainly depends on polluters' moral constraints and social pressure. Public education and information about nonpoint pollution provide control mechanism. This is a weak, but common, option for NPS regulation when compared to other regulatory options. It is weak because it doesn't require any action be taken; it relies on polluters taking action themselves. = Command and control = Command and control policies are direct government regulations. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is designed with this kind of direct command and control regulation for point source pollution. However, command and control regulations through the CWA apply to nonpoint source pollution a lesser extent. Total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) are one tool in the CWA that directly regulates NPS effluent. As noted earlier, the CWA requires state governments to set TMDLs based on both point source and NPS effluent. However, conventional command and control policies could potentially influence industry structure and cause political reluctance in the event that it could bankrupt businesses.David Letson. Point/Nonpoint Source pollution reduction trading: an interpretive survey. Natural Resources Journal =Economic incentives= Incentive based instruments include performance incentives, like taxes on nonpoint pollution sources; design incentives, like subsidies on inputs and control technology; market-based approaches, like trading and/or abatement allowances. Economic incentives are frequently used to control NPS pollution, and include things like the CWA section 319 and 208 grants. Below, different economic incentives are listed along with explanations and how they apply to NPS pollution. Design standards or technology specifications These types of regulations specify how a certain plant, piece of machinery, or pollution control apparatus should be designed. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have written numerous design standards on the assumption that a particular technology exists whose performance can meet the regulations. A regulatory target may prudently decide its safest course to compliance is to install that technology. Design-based standards are widely applied to agricultural nonpoint sources, including Best Management Practices (BMPs) on cropland. For example, there can be a mandatory establishment of riparian buffer strips between the cropland and neighboring water bodies. There are also restrictions on where and at what rates agricultural chemicals can be applied to crops. Design based standards require an effective measurement approach, like Best Management Practices, while performance standards require polluters to emit only a specified amount.Ribaudo, Marc; Richard D. Horan and Mark E. Smith (1999). \\"Economics of water quality protection from nonpoint sources: theory and practice\\". Resource Economics Division, Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Agricultural Economic Report: 782.Larson, Douglas; Gloria Helfand, Brett House (1996). \\"Second-Best Tax Policies to Reduce Nonpoint Source Pollution\\". American Journal of Agricultural Economics: 1108-1117. Performance standards or emission limits Performance standards or emission limits are types of regulations that set an objective or performance level for the regulatory target to meet. What makes these regulatory approaches unique is that they do not specify how the polluter must meet the standard. These regulations can include emission limits that specify the rate, amount, and kinds of pollutants that may be emitted from a given source over a specific period. The EPA's various effluent limitations for water pollution under the Clean Water Act are simply a few of the many environmental regulations that are nominally performance standards. Product bans and use limitations These prohibit a product or activity or limit its use. Product bans and limitations apply to NPS pollution through restrictions on things like chemicals, pesticides, and food additives. For example, farmers were banned from using the insecticide DDT in 1972 for their crops because it was found to be harmful to humans and wildlife. Marketable allowances and trading system Marketable allowances are a regulatory approach that allows companies to buy and sell pollution rights. This type of regulation uses market forces to ensure that pollution is reduced in the least costly manner to the polluter. Under a marketable allowance system, there is a presumption that permits will be traded to those companies which have the highest pollution abatement costs. These companies would then sell their allowances to other companies for whom such reductions would be more expensive. Auctions to effectively allocate resources, like public pollution control expenses, could increase competition and maximize revenues in private markets for pollution control. This mechanism could also used to improve the efficiency and cost- effectiveness of government programs. This mechanism provides better market- based information to allocate resources effectively with lower cost. The societal goal is to reduce pollution rather than to avoid paying for unsuccessful pollution control projects. Auctions for public pollution control expenses could be a way to deal with some of the most intractable sources of pollution including nonpoint pollution sources. The government could accept bids based on units of cost per units of pollution reduced and it could pay based on proof of actual pollution reductions based on a performance measurement.Harrington, Winston; Alan J. Krupnick, Henry M. Peskin (1985). \\"Policies for nonpoint-source water pollution control\\". Journal of Soil and Water Conservation: 27-32 An optimal economical trading ratio for tradable permits, like through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which defines allowable emissions or loading amount for polluters that hold a permit. The number of polluters then becomes the key factor for this instrument. Based on the stochastic nature of nonpoint pollution, NPDES permit system for point sources can not simply be used on nonpoint sources. Although many literature reviews mention tradable permits between point sources and nonpoint sources, unfortunately, current economic literature provides little guidance as to how to set trading ratios. Important factors like environmental risk and relative contributions to ambient pollution are critical to designing the appropriate ratio.Horan. Differences in social and public risk perceptions and conflicting impacts on point/nonpoint trading ratios. American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Vol.83, No. 4. Nov 2001 Pollution taxes or emission charges Typical policy remedies such as Pigouvian taxes cannot address the issue of non-point source pollution. Such policies require direct monitoring of pollution at the individual polluter level. This is, by definition of pollution being non-point source, infeasible. The economics literature has many alternative policy remedies however. These alternative policies try to apply the polluter pays principle but basing the tax on what can be observed. Things that a tax can be based on include, the use of dirty inputs, a proxy for individual emissions, or some measure of ambient pollution level. In the case of agriculture, one basis for NPS controls would be to tax farmers based on the amount of erosion they cause. However, measuring erosion and topsoil is expensive. Another way is to impose special purpose district property taxes on farmland that does not adopt best management practices or employ methods to reduce nonpoint source pollution.Zaring, D. Agriculture, Nonpoint Source Pollution, and Regulatory Control: The Clean Water Act's Bleak Present and Future. Originally published in Harvard Environmental Law Review 1996. Another option is to tax farmers based on the amount of fertilizer and pesticides they use. Taxes on pesticides, however, would be limited by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) which takes into account economic impacts. However, a tax on pesticides would only reduce one source of agricultural NPS pollution and would ignore other important sources, such as livestock waste runoff from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Research done by Segerson \\"demonstrated that taxes-based approaches on ambient water quality can achieve an efficient level of nonpoint pollution, with a uniform tax appropriate for heterogeneous farmers only when marginal benefits of abating pollution are constant.\\" Larson, et al. Second-best tax policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution. American journal of agricultural economics, vol. 78, no. 4, Nov 1996 When marginal damages from pollution are uncertain, a cost-effectiveness approach is often the most useful framework. The most cost- effective policy is one that has the smallest deadweight loss in achieving certain policy goals. One case study in Salinas Valley in California shows a water-only tax at about $0.21/mm-ha would achieve a 20% reduction, cost roughly $138 in tax payment; a nitrogen-only tax at $0.76/kg associated with a tax bill of $79 could also achieve a 20% reduction. Subsidies Subsidies are the converse of taxes. Corporate investments beneficial to the environment can be encouraged by providing companies with public funds, tax breaks, or other benefits to subsidize such activities. In the past, subsidies frequently promoted environmentally destructive activities. Elimination of such subsidies can be a means to promote environmental protections. However, subsidy programs are not without problems. They are often difficult to revise or abandon, may result in a freerider effect, and may have unintended effects that negate some benefits Harrington, et al. Policies for nonpoint-source water pollution control. Soil and water conservation society. 1985 The federal government has provided a number of subsidies to state NPS programs. The CZMA, for example, provides funds for state coastal NPS programs.Malik, et al. Economic Incentives for Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Control. Water Resources Bulletin, American Water Resources Association. Vol. 30, No. 3. June 1994 Deposit refund systems A deposit-refund system for contaminants like pesticides, which is similar to current programs for beverage containers could potentially reduce uncontrolled disposal, over-use, and recycling for pesticides. For example, the retail dealer could pay a deposit when purchasing pesticides, and pass the deposit to consumers, who could receive a refund when he or she returned the container to dealers. =Liability rules and insurance requirements= Some statutes strengthen common law rules imposing liability for environmental damage. Regulations issued under other statutes are intended to increase the effectiveness of liability rules by requiring that facilities seeking permits to handle hazardous materials have sufficient insurance or other resources to pay for potential damage caused by their activities. Liability guides compensation when polluters are sued. Liability could be strict (pay for any damages), or negotiable with the victims. However, private lawsuits are a difficult way to resolve nonpoint source pollution because it is difficult to prove NPS pollution was the proximate cause of damages. The inability to trace nonpoint sources could greatly weaken the effectiveness of liability. Agriculture is a major source for nonpoint pollution sources, including nutrients, sediments, pesticides and salts, etc. Disaster insurance for agricultural sector could be necessary for preventing nonpoint pollution based on its characteristics. The uncertainty associate with nonpoint pollution may demand an \\"insurance policy\\" to protect water quality. =Information and education= A number of policies have been developed that are intended to inform regulators and private citizens as to how NPS effluent can be better controlled. One example is with the CZMA mentioned earlier, the EPA is required to provide states with a listing of best management practices (BMPs) for controlling NPS coastal pollution. BMPs are state-of-the-art methods to treat NPS pollution. There is no shortage of BMPs to reduce NPS pollution. For agriculture, examples of BMPs include: conservation easements, cover crops, drainage management, grid sampling, manure injection, manure staging, reduced tillage practices, rotational grazing, and two stage ditches. Additional examples are offered in the nonpoint source pollution page. The obvious problem with educational and informational tools, however, is there is no guarantee they will be implemented. =Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution= To evaluate these tools' potential, some economic, distributional and political characteristics should be considered: economic performance, administration and enforcement costs, flexibility, incentives for innovation and political feasibility. Challenge regulation or environmental contracting could also be applied. With challenge regulation, the government could establish a clear environmental performance target, while the regulated community could design and implement a program for achieving it. Environmental contracting involved an agreement between a government agency and a source to waive certain regulatory requirements in return for an enforceable commitment to achieve superior performances. Challenges for regulation Nonpoint source controls are difficult to coordinate because they are usually administered by local rather than state government. Local governments do not have an incentive to adopt nonpoint source controls because their nonpoint pollution usually is exported elsewhere. Another problem is the pervasiveness of nonpoint pollution. A major strategy controls nonpoint pollution at the source by reducing surface runoff through the use of best management practices (BMPs). But BMPs are fragmented and difficult to coordinate because of the great variety in nonpoint sources and because they are administered by local governments. Another obstacle to control nonpoint pollution is that the nonpoint source may be unable to internalize the cost of the control or pass it on to consumers. Besides, policy instruments and policy combination should have strong legal enforcement like liability to insure transparency in transaction and prevent failure in market based instruments. Characteristics of NPS and the differences from point source pollution indicated stricter and powerful control mechanism should be applied. Market-based approaches, design- based approaches, and command and control could be useful, and a policy tool combination or best suit tool depends on particular problem, local condition and policy goal, as well as costs and budget would be desired. The ultimate goal for controlling nonpoint pollution is to maximize environmental benefits, especially in some environmental sensitive areas, degraded areas, critical habitats for endangered species. The baseline for nonpoint pollution abatement should be attending acceptable water quality. Collaboration among agencies is necessary. Federal agencies involved in nonpoint pollution control include Soil Conservation Service, US Forest Service, Office of Surface Mining, Bureau of Land Management, US Army Corps of Engineers, etc. Effective management of NPS pollution requires a partnership among state, federal, local agencies as well as private interests and the public. Coordination among existing programs, especially governmental spending programs, should be performance objectives. Examples of coordination include the federal construction grant program under title II of the 1972 FWPCA Amendments, which reduce municipal sewage pollution by providing necessary funds, as well as governmental spending programs like the CWA and the Farm Bill and other programs provided funding on a large number of discrete sources of nonpoint pollution sources could get a better connection to allocate funding resource effectively.

Pownoll was born the son of a leading shipwright, and entered the navy in the last year of the War of the Austrian Succession. After several years service he rose through the ranks to his own command in time for the outbreak of the Seven Years' War. Commanding a sloop he took part in the capture of one of the most valuable prizes taken in the entire conflict, and became immensely wealthy overnight from his success. He married and settled on his estate, but despite his riches, chose to return to active service on the outbreak of the American War of Independence. During his time as a frigate captain he acted as a mentor to future star captains Edward Pellew and John Borlase Warren. His service in North America was marked with successes in supporting and conveying troops, and engaging in larger fleet actions such as the relief of Gibraltar. He took part in a hard-fought action against a French privateer in 1779, and received a musket ball to the chest, which remained with him for the rest of his life. He again engaged a heavily armed privateer the following year, and this time was killed by a cannonball in the heat of the action, which was brought to a successful conclusion by his first lieutenant. His death was marked with tributes from the leading naval figures of his age, including Admiral John Jervis and Edward Pellew. Family and early life Pownoll was born in Plymouth circa 1734, the son of master shipwright Israel Pownoll (d.1779), who had built a large number of warships for the Royal Navy over his career. Israel Pownoll served as master shipwright of the dockyard at Plymouth between 1762 and 1765, and of Chatham from 1775 until his death. He owned property in the Shadwell and Clerkenwell areas of London, suggesting that the family descended from the Independent seamen and merchants who were numerous in the Shadwell and Wapping area at the time, and had connections with New England. The naval antiquary Edward Hawke Locker later described Philemon as ‘a Gentleman of American extraction’. Philemon Pownoll entered the navy in about 1748, joining the 64-gun . He passed his lieutenant's examination on 7 April 1755, at which point his age was recorded as ‘upwards of twenty’, and was promoted to lieutenant on 7 October 1755. He was at first appointed to be second lieutenant of the 60-gun , and was later moved to the 100-gun . Pownoll continued to serve in the Navy with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, and in 1758 was moved to the 74-gun . Namur was at this time the flagship of Admiral Edward Boscawen, who became Pownoll's patron and rapidly promoted him from fourth to first lieutenant, and then on 6 August 1759 to commander of the sloop . Command Pownoll commanded Favourite for the next two years, and in mid-1761 was sailing as part of a squadron off Cadiz under Captain Charles Proby, consisting of the 74-gun ships and and the 44-gun . Two French ships, the 64-gun Achille and the frigate Bouffonne escaped the port on 16 July, but were chased down and brought to action the following day by the British squadron. After a fierce fight, both ships were captured. Pownoll was still in command by May 1762, when Favourite was one of the ships sent by Admiral Sir Charles Saunders to guard Cape St Vincent. On 15 May Favourite was sailing in company with Captain Herbert Sawyer's frigate off Cape St Mary, when a Spanish ship was sighted and chased down. Once captured she was found to be the Spanish register ship Hermione, which had sailed from Lima on 6 January bound for Cadiz with a valuable cargo of bags of dollars, gold coin, ingots of gold and silver, cocoa, and blocks of tin. The Hermione was taken into Gibraltar and eventually condemned as a prize, with her contents, hull, and fittings valued at £519,705 10s. 0d., approximately £ at today's prices. Pownoll and Sawyer each received captain's shares of the prize money of £64,872, approximately £ at today's prices, amounting to one of the largest individual sums obtained in the period. The ordinary seamen received £480 each, equivalent to thirty years' wages. Coincidentally Sawyer and Pownoll had been courting two sisters, the daughters of a Lisbon merchant, but had been rejected for their lack of funds. Now suddenly extremely wealthy, the two captains married the sisters. Pownoll used his money to buy an estate at Sharpham in the parish of Ashprington in Devon, where he built a large mansion house, surviving today, designed by Robert Taylor, with gardens designed by Capability Brown. It was about this time that he commissioned a portrait from Sir Joshua Reynolds. Continued service Despite his immense wealth Pownoll returned to naval service in late 1774, shortly after the outbreak of the American War of Independence. For this he was praised by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich in the House of Lords. Pownoll was given command of the 32-gun in December, and prepared her for a voyage to North America. While mustering his crew, a young midshipman was recommended to him by Hugh Boscawen, 2nd Viscount Falmouth, the brother of Pownoll's old patron, Admiral Edward Boscawen. Possibly out of consideration to his debt to the admiral, Pownoll agreed to take him on. The young midshipman was Edward Pellew, who had been turned out of his previous ship, , after a quarrel with her captain, John Stott, but went on to become one of the great naval commanders of his age. Pownoll and his officers oversaw the fitting out of their ship, which almost ended in disaster when a storm in February 1775 swept Blonde from her moorings at Chatham and nearly wrecked her, the ship being saved by Pownoll's prompt action. Blonde sailed for North America in April that year, in company with the frigate , and via St Helen's, where they collected a convoy of twenty transports carrying troops under General John Burgoyne. During the voyage Burgoyne was alarmed to see a midshipman on a yardarm balancing on his head. Pownoll reassured him that it was just one of Pellew's antics, and that 'should [he] fall, he would only go under the ship's hull and come up on the other side.' Later in the voyage Pellew jumped overboard to save a man's life, and was reprimanded for his actions by Pownoll, though he later shed tears when talking about it with his fellow officers and called Pellew 'a noble fellow.' Pellew and Pownoll served at the relief of Quebec. Pownoll returned to North America in April 1776, and was active against American shipping, capturing the privateer Freedom on 16 September 1777, and the privateer True Blue on 27 January 1778. In January 1777 Pownoll was appointed to command the 32-gun HMS Apollo, and brought Pellew with him to his new command. By now a popular figure with his men, Pownoll was able to write to Lord Sandwich that he was '...happily situated in a fine ship & exceedingly well manned with all volunteers except 15 landsmen I received from Admiral Amherst to complete my compliment not having time to do it myself.' Apollo served for a time as Lord Howe's flagship from August 1778, and had returned to be refitted and coppered at Plymouth in December that year. Returning to active service in January, on 31 January 1779 she engaged the 26-gun French frigate Oiseau off the Brittany coast in a hard-fought action that left both Pownoll and the French commander wounded. Pownoll was hit in the chest by a musket ball, which remained lodged there for the remainder of his life. Apollo was repaired at Plymouth, and returned to sea later in 1779, joining the fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Hardy. Pownoll captured the 14-gun Mutine on 2 October 1779, and joined Reynolds's squadron later that month. He sailed the following year in support of George Brydges Rodney's mission to relieve Gibraltar, and was present at the attack on the Caracas convoy on 8 January 1780, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 16/17 January, and the eventual relief of Gibraltar on 19 January. In the Battle of Cape St. Vincent Pownoll distinguished himself by engaging the Spanish ship of the line Monarca in an unequal engagement for over an hour, compelling the Monarca to strike her colours just as Rodney's flagship arrived on the scene.Syrett, p. 241 On 2 March 1780 the privateer Victoire was captured by Apollo, and in mid June Apollo was cruising in company with the 32-gun , under Captain the Hon. George Murray. Last fight On 15 June a cutter was sighted while cruising in the North Sea and Murray was sent to investigate it. After closing to within gunshot of the cutter by 10.30am, a large sail was observed standing off the land. The two ships closed, tacking about to gain the weather gauge, and eventually opening fire. Apollos opponent was the 26-gun French privateer Stanislaus, and after a period of tacking, the two engaged in broadsides while running for Ostend. After nearly an hour of intense cannonading Pownoll was hit by a cannon ball and killed. Command of Apollo devolved to Pellew as the first lieutenant, who continued the fight, eventually driving the Stanislaus on shore. Apart from her captain, Apollo lost five men killed and had twenty wounded. The Stanislaus was later recovered and brought into the navy as . Legacy Memorial engraving entitled 'Capt Philemon Pownoll of his Majesty's Ship Apollo slain in Fight On 15 June 1780' Pownoll's death was widely mourned, Pellew writing in his report to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be severely felt. The ship's company have lost a father. I have lost much more, a father and a friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that we all feel for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of him that he was ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and went on to become a leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family. Notes a. Variants of the surname include Pownall and Pownell.

Born in Paddington, London, Maudslay was the son of Athol Edward Maudslay, \\"gentleman\\", and Kate, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucas, founder of a large firm of building contractors. Maudslay was educated at St David's School in Moffat, Scotland, followed by Marlborough College. After leaving school he attended the Crystal Palace School of Engineering, trained as a civil engineer under Sir John Wolfe-Barry, during which time he worked on a number of major engineering projects such as Barry Docks. Maudslay abandoned his civil engineering career in 1902 and with financial support from Wolfe-Barry moved to Coventry, where he leased a small workshop; his cousin, Cyril Maudslay, was by then managing director of the nearby Maudslay Motor Company. In 1903 Reginald Maudslay established the Standard Motor Company in larger premises in Much Park Street. Unable to use the family name to brand his vehicles, Maudslay appears to have been influenced in his adoption of the \\"Standard\\" marque by the Roman standard on display in the lounge of his house. 1913 Model S 2-seater tourer In 1914 the Standard Motor Company went public, for a \\"comparatively modest\\" £50,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Production was increased and soon reached 750 cars per year. Maudslay was reported to be a designer of \\"considerable ability\\", and reputedly invented the side-entrance car body so familiar today, but his contribution to the development of Standard after the First World War is \\"difficult to assess\\". He relied heavily on the engineering skills of others such as John Budge and later John Black, who by 1933 was joint managing director with Maudslay. Maudslay's enthusiasm for the export market drove the company's finances into the doldrums during the 1920s, particularly in 1927 after an anticipated large Australian order, to which most of the company's production had been diverted, failed to materialise. Maudslay married Susan Gwendolen, née Herbert, on 30 January 1908; the couple had two sons and a daughter. One of the sons, Henry, flew with the Royal Air Force in World War II, and was killed on the famous Dam Busters' Raid in May 1943. Little is known of his private life, but \\"he acquired the reputation of a country gentleman and was fond of inspecting the shop floor wearing a deerstalker hat and matching overcoat.\\" Contemporaries described him as \\"a gentlemanly engineer of the old school who found it difficult to adjust his ideas to the post-1918 industry\\". He died in Marylebone, London, on 14 December 1934 after a short illness.

Separated into defensive and supportive techniques, the categories provide a framework for effective communication. The categories are outlined by Jack Gibb. Gibb categories point out six defensive behaviors used during interpersonal communication. Gibb has six opposing viewpoints that are known as supportive behaviors. Defensive behaviors are carried out when a person feels threatened during communication and hence the need to defend him or herself.Adler, R.B., & Proctor II, R.F. (2011). Looking out, looking in (13th ed.). Boston, MA: Wadsworth Supportive communication is important as humans interact, as people need to feel a connection with other people.Reference 2 Gibb believes that there are times and places when to use his methods of communication. He states that his ideas are better created for cultures like the United States where communication is more direct.Gibb, J.R. (2007). Defensive communication. In C. D. Mortensen (Ed.), Communication theory (2nd ed.), (p. 201- 212). New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers. Also, there are times when supportive behaviors should be considered the wrong type of communication. It is important to know which type of communication is needed in a given situation. The first form of defensive behavior is evaluation.Reference 3 These are known as \\"you\\" statements and put all the focus on the other person. This kind of behavior is about judging the other communicator. In return the supportive behavior is description.Reference 3 This focuses on the communicator's ideas rather than putting blame on someone else. Description behavior is about the feelings of the speaker and can be described as \\"I\\" statements.Reference 3 The second defensive behavior is control, which is when one person is forcing a solution upon the other person.Reference 3 This means that the speaker is making a decision that affects both the speaker and the listener without considering what the listener wants or needs.Reference 3 The supportive behavior that contrasts control is problem orientation.Reference 3 This is when a person looks for a solution that will satisfy both people. Finding a solution that will please both people is more important than one person winning and the other person losing.Reference 1 Strategy is another form of defensive behavior, which can be used when a person feels threatened.Reference 3 This form is about manipulating the other person in order to come out on top. Strategy can be very hurtful as the speaker is being deceitful. Spontaneity is about being honest and truthful with the listener.Reference 3 There are times when the truth should not be so direct but knowing when to be direct and when to be subtle is key to good communication.Reference 1 The fourth type of defensive behavior is neutrality.Reference 3 This is when the speaker has little concern or interest in the conversation. Neutrality makes the listener feel unwelcome and unimportant. The opposite of this is empathy.Reference 3 Empathy allows for acceptance of the other person and their feelings. This can be taken as both verbal and non-verbal messages as communication is not linear and both communicators are giving and receiving messages at all times.Reference 1 Another form of defensive behavior in communication is superiority.Reference 3 This is when a person believes that they are better than the listener and can be shown by the way the speaker delivers the message. Equality is the contrasting behavior and shows that all people have self-worth.Reference 3 There are times when a speaker may be smarter or be better at something than the listener but speaking to them at the same level is important.Reference 1 The final defensive behavior is certainty.Reference 3 When communicators believe they are right and that the other person is wrong and will not listen to the other person's ideas they are demonstrating certainty behavior. Provisionalism is the supportive behavior that contrasts certainty.Reference 3 This is when one person feels they are correct but is willing to listen to the other person and is prepared to change their mind or opinion if the other idea is more reasonable.Reference 1 Conclusion The six different defensive and supportive behaviors are used during interpersonal communication. There are times when both types of communication should be used and times when they should not be used. Understanding when to use the different communication skills is key to effective interpersonal communication.  References  * Adler, R.B., & Proctor II, R.F. (2011).

This market begat in the 1950s as part of efforts to urbanize the markets in the area. The market is located on the corner of Congreso de la Union and Avenida Morelos, just southeast of the historic center of the city. Although it is one of the main markets for souvenirs, produce and meat, it is best known for its flowers and ornamental plants. There are 1,150 stands dedicated to the selling of cut flowers, flower arrangements, ornamental plants and accessories such as flowerpots. The market offers about 5,000 types of flowers and plants, mostly foreign, but there is a number of native Mexican species available, including some gathered directly from the wild. In Spanish, jamaica means the hibiscus flower (as well as the island nation of Jamaica). Description This market is housed in three large naves covering a city block on the corner of Congreso de la Unión and Avenida Morelos in the Venustiano Carranza borough. The Metro Jamaica station on Line 9 is directly in front of the building. The market is one of the principal ones for fruits, vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants in the city and is bustling to chaotic, especially on weekends. The market is best known for the sale of flowers and ornamental plants. There are 1,150 stands dedicated to flowers, flower arrangements and ornamental plants and associated accessories. 25.5% sell cut flowers, 26% sell flower arrangements, 4.3% sell flower pots and other accessories, 40.9% of the stalls are reserved for the trucks of flower producers and sellers and 3.2% sell ornamental plants, including those from the wild. The market sells about 5,000 types flowers and ornamental plants from the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Chiapas, Oaxaca, State of Mexico and Michoacán. The variety of flowers is wide from roses to those from the various tropics. There are both retail and wholesale sales, mostly to florists in Mexico City, but sales are also made to some of the surrounding states. There are even exports to the United States and Haiti. One of the aisle in the cut flowers section The market also sells a number of species of plants which are native to Mexico and not commonly appreciated as ornamental plants. Between this market and the flower market in Tenancingo, State of Mexico, a 2007 study identified 131 species from 93 genera and 42 families, with orchidaceae best represented. There are five main types: Briopsida, Pteridopsida, Pinopsida, Magnoliopsida and Liliopsida, with the last two accounting for 93% of all species. However, these 131 species are only a fraction of the 434 native Mexican species which have been identified as having ornamental potential. 95% of the species sold are on no or little risk of extinction or need of any special protection. Exceptions to this are Coryphantha elephantidens, Nymphaea odorata, Tillandsia imperialis, Campyloneurum phyllitidis, Cupressus lusitanic and Barkeria scandens. Many of these species are taken directly from the wild with little or no monitoring. However, the vast majority of the flower and plant species sold at the market are not native to Mexico, a situation reflected in the rest of the country. One reason for this is that most of the plant sellers here do not know the taxonomy of the native plants. Halloween piñatas for sale at the market The market sells a number of other products besides plants and flowers. There are 312 stands dedicated to other merchandise such as produce, meat, groceries and other items, as a major supplies of basic staples in the area. Most of the meat sold is common, but unusual animals such as frogs and chichicuilotes (a type of native bird) can be found as well. The market is also one of the major sellers of Christmas trees in the city. Most of the species sold are not native to Mexico and many are imported as they are considered to have better foliage and are usually cheaper. There is a section dedicated to piñatas, most made with cardboard and covered in crepe paper, although more traditional ones with a clay pot in the center can still be found. Designs range from traditional stars to those based on recent figures from popular movies and television shows. The busiest time of year for this section of the market is December, before Christmas, when a tradition called “Las Posadas” often involves the breaking of one or more piñatas. While traditional to that season, the breaking of piñatas is no longer confined to December and can be found at various types of celebrations year round, which helps to support this section’s permanent presence. History Today, the area is part of the highly urbanized center of Mexico City, just south east of the historic center. In the past, this area was on the eastern edge of the Aztec island city of Tenochtitlan, facing Lake Xochimilco. The area was filled with artificial islands called “chinampas” for farming and docks to service the thousands of canoes and barges that passed through here on their way to city markets, especially the main market at Tlatelolco. Trade traffic diminished somewhat after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, but it still remained very important. However, during the colonial period, the lake and chinampa areas here slowly dried as the lakes were drained. By the 19th century, the area had only canals, with the main one, Canal de la Viga limited the water traffic through here. By the mid 20th century, these too would be dried and filled in. Traffic would shift to the various major roads constructed here. Through the area’s history, there had been a number of markets and tianguis here. The market was established along with a number of others such as Mercado de Sonora, to modernize the markets of the east end of town in the 1950s. Mercado Jamaica was inaugurated on September 23, 1957, and along with the Mercado de Sonora, was the first to offer parking for cars. In 2007, the market celebrated its 50th anniversary along with the then head of the borough of Venustiano Carranza, Julios César Moreno Rivera, which includes cultural activities and shows with popular music.

Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA) : Class: RG 9; Piece: 9; Folio: 40; Page: 21; GSU roll: 542555 he was the fourth son of Commander John Elliott, R.N. (1759–1834), who as a midshipman had sailed on the second voyage to the Pacific of Captain Cook, and his wife Isabella Todd (1762–1841). Career He entered the army as an ensign in the 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot on 6 December 1809. In January 1811 the 5lst joined Lord Wellington's army while encamped within the lines of Torres Vedras, and Elliott's first battle was Fuentes de Oñoro. He was present at the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and of Badajoz, and at the battle of Salamanca, and was promoted lieutenant on 13 August 1812. During the retreat from Burgos he acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Mitchell, commanding the first brigade of the seventh division, and was wounded in conveying despatches under fire. In June 1813, he was appointed acting aide-de-camp to Major-General Inglis, and served with him at the Battle of the Pyrenees, when he was again wounded, and at the battles of the Nivelle and Orthez. He was then appointed brigade-major to the first brigade, seventh division, in which capacity he served until the end of the war. Elliott was next present with the 51st at the Battle of Waterloo, and he had charge of the scaling-ladders at the storm of Cambrai. He was promoted captain on 9 November 1820. From 1821–34, the 51st was stationed in the Ionian Islands, and Elliott, who never left his regiment, was promoted major on 12 July 1831. On 27 June 1838 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and he commanded the 51st in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and at Bangalore, until 1852. In that year his regiment was ordered for service in the Second Anglo-Burmese War, and Elliott was detailed to command the Madras brigade in the first campaign. Under the superintendence of General Godwin, Elliott's brigade led the way in the fierce fighting of 10, 11, and 12 April 1852, in which Rangoon was captured, and in the storming of the Shwedagon Pagoda on 14 April. In the second campaign, which began in September 1852, Elliott again had command of a brigade, consisting of his own regiment and two battalions of Madras native infantry, and he co-operated successfully in the capture of Donabyu, the stronghold of the outlaw Nya Myat Toon, who had a short time before defeated Captain Granville Gower Loch. For these services he received a medal and clasp, was made a C.B., and made commandant at Rangoon. While there he discovered and suppressed on 20 November 1853 a plot which had for its aim the destruction of all the British in Rangoon, and thus saved the British hold on the city. In 1855 he gave up the command of the regiment with which he had been so long associated and on 20 January 1857 he was promoted major-general. He never again went on active service, but he was made a K.C.B. in 1862 and was appointed colonel of the 51st Foot on 1 June in that year. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 July 1863, full general on 25 October 1871 and G.C.B. on 24 May 1873.

It was first published in French in 1949, titled L'Enracinement. The first English translation was published in 1952. Like all of Weil's books it was published posthumously. The work diagnoses the causes of the social, cultural and spiritual malaise which Weil saw as afflicting 20th century civilisation, particularly Europe but also the rest of the world. 'Uprootedness' is defined as a near universal condition resulting from the destruction of ties with the past and the dissolution of community. Weil specifies the requirements that must be met so that peoples can once again feel rooted, in a cultural and spiritual sense, to their environment and to both the past and to expectations for the future. The book discusses the political, cultural and spiritual currents that ought to be nurtured so that people have access to sources of energy which will help them lead fulfilling, joyful and morally good lives. A leading theme is the need to recognise the spiritual nature of work. The Need for Roots is regarded as Weil's best known work and has provoked a variety of responses, from being described as a work of \\"exceptional originality and breadth of human sympathy\\" to \\"a collection of egregious nonsense.\\" Background Free French Resistance movement. Weil was stationed here while she wrote Need for Roots. The book was written in the early months of 1943. Its initial form was a report which Weil had been asked to write for the Free French Resistance movement concerning the possibilities for effecting a regeneration in France once the Germans had been driven back. The work was originally submitted along with a shorter companion essay called Draft for a statement of human obligations. \\"Spirituality of work\\", a leading theme in the book, was a concept that had occupied Weil throughout her career. According to biographer Richard Rees, her whole life's work can be viewed as an attempt to elucidate the concept, which she saw as the one great original idea of the West.The other great ideas that have occupied Western minds were in Weil's opinion borrowed mainly from the Greeks. Weil presented physical labour as the type of work most suited to develop a direct connection with God. Her analysis was informed by a year-long stretch as a factory hand and by several periods working as an agricultural labourer. Synopsis The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 is subdivided into fourteen sections, each dealing with a specific human need. Collectively these are referred to as 'needs of the soul'. Part 2 is subdivided into three sections, dealing with the concept of uprootedness in relation to urban life, to rural life and to nationhood. Part 3 is undivided and discusses the possibilities for inspiring a nation. Only a small part of the book discusses the specific solutions that were of unique applicability to France in the 1940s. Most of the work discusses the general case and is of broad and lasting relevance. =Part 1: The Needs of the Soul= Part 1 begins with a discussion of obligations and rights. Weil asserts that obligations are more fundamental than rights, as a right is only meaningful insofar as others fulfil their obligation to respect it. A man alone in the universe, she says, would have obligations but no rights. Rights are therefore \\"subordinate and relative\\" to obligations. Weil says that those directing the French Revolution were mistaken in basing their ideas for a new society on the notion of rights rather than obligations, suggesting that a system based on obligations would have been better. Weil claims that while rights are subject to varying conditions, obligations are \\"eternal\\", \\"situated above this world\\" and \\"independent of conditions\\", applying to all human beings. The actual activities which obligations require us to perform, however, may vary depending on circumstances. The most fundamental obligation involves respecting the essential needs of others - the \\"needs of the soul\\". Weil backs up her ideas on the needs of the soul by mentioning that Christian, ancient Egyptian and other traditions have held similar moral views throughout history, particularly on the obligation to help those suffering from hunger. This, Weil says, should serve as a model for other needs of the soul. Weil also makes a distinction between physical needs (such as for food, heating and medical attention) and non-physical needs that are concerned with the \\"moral side\\" of life. Both kinds are vital, and the deprivation of these needs causes one to fall into a state \\"more or less resembling death\\". Weil goes into some detail on collectives.\\"Collectives\\" meaning all kinds of human groups and organisations, from local clubs to national parties. She says that obligations are not binding to collectives, but to the individuals of which the collective is composed. Collectives should be respected, not for their own sake, but because they are 'food for mankind'. Collectives that are not 'food for mankind' - harmful or useless collectives - should be removed. The remainder of Part 1 is divided into sections discussing the essential needs of the soul, which Weil says correspond to basic bodily needs like the requirements for food, warmth and medicine. She says such needs can mostly be grouped into antithetical pairs, such as the needs for rest and activity, or for warmth and coolness, and that they are best satisfied when a balance is struck allowing both needs to be met in turn. In communities where all essential needs are satisfied there will be a \\"flowering of fraternity, joy, beauty and happiness\\".In Draft for a statement of human obligations Order Order is introduced as a preeminent need. Weil defines order as an arrangement of society which minimises the situations one encounters where a choice has to be made between incompatible obligations. Liberty Liberty is described as the ability to make meaningful choices. It is recognized that societies must inevitably have rules for the common good which restrict freedom to a certain degree. Weil argues that these rules do not truly diminish one's liberty if they meet certain conditions; if their purpose is easily grasped and there aren't too many, then mature individuals of good will should not find the rules oppressive. This is illustrated by describing the habit of \\"not eating disgusting or dangerous things\\" as not being an infringement of liberty. The only people who would feel restricted by such rules are characterized as childlike. Obedience Obedience is defined as an essential need of the soul as long as it's the sort of obedience that arises from freely given consent to obey a given set of rules or the commands of a leader. Obedience motivated by a fear of penalties or a desire for reward is mere servility and of no value. The author writes that it's important that the social structure has a common goal, the essence of which can be grasped by all, so people can appreciate the purpose of the rules and orders. Responsibility Weil says that everyone has a need to feel useful and even essential to others. They should ideally make at least some decisions and have opportunity to show initiative as well as carrying out work. She says the unemployed person is starved of this need. Weil advises that for people of a fairly strong character this need extends to a requirement to take a leadership role for at least part of their lives, and that a flourishing community life will provide sufficient opportunities for all to have their turn commanding others. Equality Equality is an essential need when defined as a recognition that everyone is entitled to an equal amount of respect as a human being, regardless of any differences. Weil advises that an ideal society ought to involve a balance of equality and inequality. While there should be social mobility both up and down, if children have a truly equal chance for self-advancement based purely on their own abilities, everyone who ends up in a low grade job will be seen as being there due to their own shortcomings. Weil says an ideal social organisation would involve holding those who enjoy power and privilege to a higher standard of conduct than those who don't; in particular a crime from an employer and against employees should be punished much more severely than a crime from an employee against his or her employer. Hierarchism Weil writes of the importance of a system of hierarchy in which one feels devotion towards superiors, not as individuals, but as symbols. Hierarchism represents the order of the heavenly realm, and it helps one to fit into their moral place. Honour Honour is the need for a special sort of respect over and above the respect automatically due to every human being. An individual's honour relates to how well their conduct measures up to certain criteria, which vary according to the social milieu inhabited by the individual. The need for honour is best satisfied when people are able to participate in a shared noble tradition. For a profession to satisfy this need, it should have an association able to \\"keep alive the memory of all the store of nobility, heroism, probity, generosity and genius spent in the exercise of that profession\\". Punishment Two sorts of necessary punishment are discussed. Disciplinary punishments help to reinforce an individual's good conscience, by providing external support in the battle against falling into vice. The second and most essential sort of punishment is the punitive. Weil considers that in a sense the committal of a crime puts the individual outside of the chain of obligations that form the good society, and that punishment is essential to re-integrate the individual into lawful society. Freedom of Opinion Weil says it's essential for people to be free to express any opinion or idea. However she advises that very harmful views should not be expressed in the part of the media that is responsible for shaping public opinion. Security Security is described as freedom from fear and terror, except under brief and exceptional circumstances. She says that permanent fear causes a \\"semi-paralysis of the soul\\". Risk Weil argues that risk, in the right amount, can be enough to protect one from a detrimental type of boredom and teach one how to appropriately deal with fear, but not be so much that one is overcome with fear. Private Property Weil writes that the soul suffers feelings of isolation if deprived of objects to call its own, which can serve as extensions of the body. She advises that where possible people should be able to own their own homes and the tools of their trade. Collective Property The need for collective property is satisfied when people, from the richest to the poorest, feel a shared sense of ownership as well as enjoyment of public buildings, land and events. Truth Weil asserts the need for truth is the most sacred of all needs. It is compromised when people don't have access to reliable and accurate sources of information. Because working people often lack the time to verify what they read in books and the mass media, writers who introduce avoidable errors should be held accountable. Propaganda should be banned and people who deliberately lie in the media should be liable to severe penalties. =Part 2: Uprootedness= Weil conceives uprootedness as a condition where people lack deep and living connections with their environment Weil later says people need multiple roots with different environments - their county, their professional milieu and their neighbourhood. It is aggravated if people also lack participation in community life. Uprooted people lack connections with the past and a sense of their own integral place in the world. Uprootedness has many causes, with two of the most potent being conquest of a nation by foreigners and the growing influence of money which tends to corrode most other forms of motivation. =Uprootedness in Towns= Sisteron in south east France. Weil considered that the nascent civilisation which existed in the Provence region before the Albigensian Crusade had a culture where labour was free from all \\"taint of slavery\\" and the spiritual dimension of work was recognised. Weil asserts that in 20th century France and elsewhere the condition of uprootedness is most advanced in towns, especially among the lower paid workers who have a total dependence on money. Weil writes their uprootedness is so severe it's effectively as though they had been banished from their own country and then temporally reinstated on sufferance, forced by oppressive employers to have almost their entire attention taken up with drudgery and piecework. For the urban poor without work it's even worse, unemployment is described as \\"uprootedness squared.\\" The gulf between high culture from the mass of the people that has been widening since the renaissance is another factor contributing to up rootedness. Education now has only limited effect in helping to create roots as academic culture has lost its connection both with this world and the next. Many academics have become obsessed with learning not for a desire for knowledge for its own sake but due to the utility it offers for attaining social prestige. Weil discussed how uprootedness is a self- propagating condition, giving the example of the Romans and Germans after World War I as uprooted people who set about uprooting others. Whoever is rooted doesn't uproot others - Weil opines that the worst examples of misconduct by the Spanish and English during the colonial age were from adventurers who lacked deep connections with the life of their own countries. Both the left and right include activists who want the working class to be rooted again, but on the left there is sizeable contingent who merely want everyone to be reduced to the same level of unrootedness as the proletariats, and on the right a section who want the workers to remain unrooted the better to be able to exploit them. Disunity prevents good intentioned activists from having much effect. Another factor hampering reform efforts is the tendency of human nature not to pay attention to misfortune - she discusses how unions often spend most of their energies looking out for relatively well off special interests, neglecting the weak who were being most oppressed, such as youth, women and immigrant workers. Weil proposes various measures to address urban uprootedness. She says little can be done for uprooted adults, but it would be easier to rescue the next generation. One of her first suggestions is to eliminate psychic shock experienced by young workers when they transition from school where authority figures care about their wellbeing to the world of work where they're effectively just a \\"cog in a machine.\\" Another ill to remedy is the exclusion of workers from an imaginative share in their companies's strategy. Machines should be designed with the needs of the workmen in mind, not just the demands of cost efficient production. The author suggests that if people have a suitable introduction to work as children, who tend to see the workplace as an intriguing world reserved for adults, then their future experience of work would forever be \\"lit up by poetry\\". Weil also advises that a revival of apprenticeships and the original Tour de France would be of great value. Weil says that many of the workers' complaints arise from obsessions created by distress and that the best of way of reacting is not to appease the obsessions but to fix the underlying distress - then all kinds of problems in society just disappear. Reforms in education would also be needed. Weil says providing workers with high culture in a form they can suggest is much simpler than objectors expect. There is no need to try and relay large volumes of literature, as a little pure truth lights the soul just as much as a lot of pure truth. The relationships between various educational topics and everyday life as experienced by the workers should be explored. Without watering down high culture, its truths should be expressed in a language \\"perceptible to the heart\\". Weil says that to abolish urban uprootedness it will be essential to establish forms of industrial production and culture where workers could feel at home, and she discussed various reforms that she advised for France after the war =Uprootedness in the Countryside= Weil writes that though uprootedness is not as far advanced in the countryside as in towns, the needs of the peasants should receive equal attention to the need of industrial workers: firstly because it is contrary to nature for the land to be worked by uprooted individuals and secondly as one of the causes of the peasant's distress is the feeling that progressive movements ignore them in favour of industrial workers. A peasant's requirements include a strong need to own land, which is important for them to feel rooted. Boredom can be a problem as many peasants do the same work throughout their lives, starting from about age 14. Weil suggests a tradition should be established for peasant youths take a few months out for travel in their late teens, similar to the tour de France that used to exist for apprentice artisans. Those who desire it should also be able to return to education for a year or two. Rural communities require different teaching methods compared to towns. Religious teaching should be made relevant to the countryside, with emphasis on the pastoral scenes in the Bible. Science should be presented in terms of the great natural cycles, such as the energy from the sun being captured by photosynthesis, being concentrated into seeds and fruit, passing into man and then partly returning to the soil as he expends energy working the land. Weil writes that if peasants have both well tailored scientific and religious ideas at the back of their minds while they work the fields, it will increase their appreciation of beauty and \\"Permeate their labour with poetry\\" In the last few pages of this section the author dwells on her central theme - that the great vocation of our times is to create a civilisation which recognises the spiritual nature of work. She draws further parallels between spiritual mechanism and physical mechanism, referring to parables in the Bible concerning seeds and then discussing our scientific understanding about how plants reach the surface by consuming the energy in their seeds and then grow upwards towards the light. Weil suggests similar parallels could be targeted for urban workers. She says if people can have both spiritual and scientific ideas converging in the act of work, then even the fatigue associated with toil can be transformed for good, becoming \\"the pain that makes the beauty of the world penetrates right into the core of the human body.\\" Weil deplores the tendency for education to train workers so they only think intellectually in their leisure hours. She says that while fundamental ideas need not be given conscious attention while workers are busy, they should always be present in the background. Weil presents the case of two women both engaged in sewing; one being a happy expectant mother, the other being a prisoner. While both have their attention occupied by the same technical problems, the pregnant women never forgets the life growing inside her while the prisoner is always in fear of punishment. Weil says the whole social problem is mirrored in the women's contrasting attitudes. She discusses the two principal forms of greatness, the false greatness based on world conquest Also discussed at length later in the book 155 - 182 and esp. p216 – 241 and true greatness which is spiritual. Like any elevated idea, care should be taken when promoting the union of work and spirituality lest it become discredited due to cynicism and suspicion, and thereby impossible to achieve. But Weil suggests it wouldn't need over selling by the authorities as it would be a solution to the problem on everyone's lips concerning the lack of balance created by rapidly developing material science that hasn't been matched with social or spiritual progress. She also suggests the movement towards recognising the spirituality of work could be embraced by all section of society - it would be welcomed by progressives and conservatives alike, with even atheist communists not opposing the idea, as certain quotes from Marx deplored the lack of spirituality in the capitalist world of work - so the movement could create unity. =Uprootedness and Nationhood= At the start of this section Weil regrets the fact that the nation has become the only collectively accessible to most people which is still at least partially rooted. She discusses how institutions both larger and smaller than the nation have been uprooted, such as Christendom, regional and local life, and the family. With regards to the family for example, for most people it has contracted just to the nuclear unit of man, wife and children. Brothers and sisters are already a little bit distant, with very few ever giving the slightest consideration to relatives that died more than 10 years before they were born, or to those who will be born after they have died. Weil discusses the particular problems affecting the French that result from their unique history: the hatred of kings and distrust of all forms of central authority due to the succession of mostly cruel kings that followed Charles V; the trend instigated by Richelieu which saw the state \\"sucking out all forms of life\\" from regional and local institutions; the distrust of religion caused by the Church siding with State; the revival in workers' spirits after the Revolution being undone by the 1871 massacre; the counter reaction that set in after World War I, because during the War the French people had exerted themselves beyond the extent provided for by the limited energies they could draw from their diminished patriotic feelings.Problems resulting from actions going beyond the energy supplied by their motivations are also discussed in p 208 - 210. Various problems relating to patriotism are discussed: how some lack any patriotism at all, while for others patriotism is too weak a motivation for the demands of wartime. Yet another problem is that for some patriotism is based on a false conception of greatness, on the success one's nation has had in conquering others - this sort of patriotism can lead people to turning a blind eye to whatever evils their country has committed. Weil suggests the ideal form of patriotism should be based on compassion. She compares the often antagonised and prideful feelings resulting from a patriotism based on grandeur with the warmth of a patriotism based on tender feeling of pity and an awareness of how a country is ultimately fragile and perishable. A patriotism based on compassion allows one to still see the flaws in one's country, while still remaining ever ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. =Part 3: The growing of Roots= The final section is concerned with the methods by which a people might be inspired towards the good, and how a nation can be encouraged to re-establish its roots. Weil discussed how in contrast to the explosion in knowledge regarding methods for working with materials, folk have begun to think that there is no method for spiritual matters. She asserts that everything in creation is dependent on method, given the spiritual methods advised by St John of the Cross as an example. Inspiring a nation is therefore a task that ought to be undertaken methodically. To accomplish the task it's essential to simultaneously point people in the direction of the good while at the same time providing the necessary motivation, so as to provide energy for the required effort. Accordingly, the methods available for inspiring a nation centre around public action by the authorities as a means of education. Weil writes this is a very difficult idea to grasp, as at least since the renaissance public action has been almost solely a means of exercising power. Weil enumerates five ways in which public action can serve to educate a nation: * By raising hopes and fears with promises and threat. * By suggestion. * By the official expression of previously unstated thoughts already in the minds of the people. * By example * By the modality of the actions. Weil considers that while the first two ways are well understood, they are unsuitable for breathing inspiration into a people. The remaining three methods could be much more effective, but at present no administration has much experience of employing them. The third method, although not without superficial similarities to the suggestive power of propaganda, can in the right circumstances be a highly effective tool for good. Weil wrote that at the current time (writing in 1943), the French resistance authorities have a rare opportunity to inspire their people as while their actions have an official character, they are not the actual state authorities and so don't arouse the cynicism the French traditionally hold for their rulers. Four obstacles are listed that make it difficult to inspire a people towards genuine goodness. First and foremost a false conception of greatness, based on the prestige of might and conquest. Weil opines that France was essentially still motivated by the same sense of greatness that drove Hitler. The other obstacles are idolisation of money, a degraded sense of Justice, and a lack of religious inspiration. Only the first and last problem are discussed at length. Weil asserts that prior to about the 16th century religion and science were united by the search for Truth, but have since become separated and in some cases even mutually hostile, with religion often the loser in the battle for public opinion. She suggests religion and science could become reconciled if the spirit of truth is breathed into both; despite the assertions of some scientists to the contrary, the thirst for truth is not a common motivation for science. As an example she discussed the habit of mathematicians who deliberately obscure proofs for their discoveries, showing that they were motivated by competitive instincts and the desire to be recognised above their peers. Weil suggests that the highest study of science is the beauty of the world. In the book's last few pages Weil returns to a discussion of the spirituality of work, presenting the case that physical labour is spiritually superior to all other forms of work such as technical planning, command, art or science. Assessment and reception General de Gaulle was Weil's ultimate boss in the Free French Movement, but he had little time for her work and refused to read the whole of Need for Roots Weil's first English biographer Richard Rees has written that Need for Roots can be described as an investigation into the causes of unhappiness and proposals for its cure. Writing in 1966 he says it contains more of what the present age needs to understand and more of the criticism it needs to listen to than any other writer of the 20th century has been able to express. According to Dr Stephen Plant, writing in 1996, Need for Roots remains just as relevant today as it was in the 1940s when the majority of European workers were employed by heavy industry. T. S. Eliot praised the work's balanced judgement, shrewdness and good sense. The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book is about politics in the \\"widest Aristotelian understanding of the term\\" and that is displayed \\"exceptional originality and breath of human sympathy\\". For Weil scholar Sian Miles the book is the most complete expression of Weil's social thought. Albert Camus was so taken with the work he wrote it seemed to him \\"impossible to imagine the rebirth of Europe without taking into consideration the suggestions outlined in it by Simone Weil.\\" General De Gaulle on the other hand was less impressed, dismissing her recommendations and only half reading most of her reports. For the most part very few of Weils idea's were put into practice during the operations that followed the liberation of France, with one of few direct signs of her influence being that a list of obligations was included along with a list of rights in a French free press release of August 1943. Poet and critic Kenneth Rexroth took a negative view of the book, writing in 1957 that it \\"was a collection of egregious nonsense\\" and \\"a weird, embarrassing relic of a too immediate past.\\" Simone Weil by Kenneth Rexroth (1957) Notes and citations References  External links 1949 non-fiction books Books published posthumously Political books Works by Simone Weil ","title":"The Need for Roots"},{"id":"31184468","text":"Ričardas Bartkevičius (born 1959 in Vilnius) is a prominent Lithuanian painter and educator.  Biography  Bartkevičius demonstrated artistic talent in his early childhood. His art studies began in Vilnius (the School of J. Vienožinskis). The first personal exhibition was held in 1979. In 1986 he graduated from the Painting Department of Vilnius Academy of Arts. During the years of the studies he got to know and he was acquainted with such leading figures of Lithuanian art as Sofija Veiverytė, Algimantas Švėgžda, Antanas Gudaitis, Augustinas Savickas, Jonas Čeponis. Looking for his own painting style he admired and drew under the inspiration of El Greco, Tintoretto, and Peter Breigel works. Later he was interested in German, French, Lithuanian representatives of Expressionism. In 1982, 1984 he visited Armenia and Georgia. The medieval coloring of these countries paintings, the primitive art traditions have found resonance in the further works. Since 1990 he became a member of the Lithuanian Artists' Association, in 1994 he initiated an artists' group \\"E\\" creation, also he became a member of the group \\"Individualists\\" (1996). In 1999 he was awarded by the annual prize from Lithuanian Artists' Association and he got the State Grant of the Highest Degree. In 2004 he again earned the State Grant of the Highest Degree. From 1990 he teaches at Vilnius Pedagogical University (Professor), he was a Head of the Department of Fine Arts for a long time. He is actively involved in Lithuanian cultural life, he had many solo exhibitions. His works are welcomed not only in the European continent, but also in Asia, American art lovers. The fact that this particular artist is admired by foreign evaluators paintings are well reflected by the fact that in 2008 he was invited to participate in the international project \\"Art Meeting East Europe\\", yet such call received only two Lithuanians - Stasys Eidrigevičius and R. Bartkevičius.  About paintings  According to the famous Polish art critic Krzysztof Stanislawski, R. Bartkevičius with the aid of the colors and forms, which often just run over the frames, is telling different stories, he is not afraid to use the traditional motives, he creates landscapes, often depicts flowers in pots, animals, also he paints portraits.Lietuvos menas šiandien (Lithuanian art today). Vilnius, 2007, . The painter is managing the bright, pure colors, the spontaneous expressive stroke of the brush. He is not only an expressionist in the soul (colors), but also physically by the whole body and the painting style. As remarked the leading Lithuanian art critic Alfonsas Andriuškevičius, R. Bartkevičius is painting not only by the hand, but one hundred percent by the movement. His works are pulsing of vital and dynamic sense of life. Joan Vastokas, an art historian, writes that Bartkevičius on the other hand although verging on the abstract are in fact figurative and expressionist in style, closely akin to and likely influenced by DeKooning or recent trends in postmodern German painting.Baltic Art during the Brezhnev Era: Nonconformist Art in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, p. 28-30. New Jersey, Rutgers University, USA. An abstract expressionist, his works feature a lot of action, broad gestures and brushstrokes and color. He juxtaposes tradition and modernity.

The Solitaire was declared the winner of the contest and its unusual layout attracted a great deal of attention. For a time in the 1980s the aircraft was available as plans and as a kit.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 126. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development Like many Rutan designs, the Solitaire uses a canard layout, with a lifting foreplane with elevators for pitch control at the nose, and a rudder at the rear of a tail boom. The pilot sits under a bubble canopy and the electro-hydraulically retractable gasoline engine occupies the space between the pilot's feet and the canard. The aircraft is constructed from fiberglass on Nomex honeycomb and urethane foam. The wing has a built-in mid-span twist to offset the effects of the canard's downwash, with the inboard having 2 degrees less twist than the outboard portion of the wing. The wing is equipped with very effective trailing edge spoilers, consisting of a flap that deploys down while also protruding its leading edge upward into the airflow. The canard configuration is designed so that the forward surface stalls before the main wing, making the aircraft unstallable, and also unspinnable. This does not mean, however, that the aircraft cannot be maneuvered into a flight regime where a high rate of descent is achieved. When it was in production, the kit included all the hardware to assemble the prefabricated fiberglass parts. The fuselage halves came with Nomex honeycomb cores and a special film adhesive to bond the halves together. The main wing spars supplied used S-glass roving spar caps that had been molded in metal molds. The kits also included many molded parts, including the seat pan, canopy pre-mounted in its frame, turtledeck, fuselage bulkheads, wing root fairings, wheel fairings, wingtips and the foam cores used in the wings and the canard. The initial engine was the Zenoah G-25, but this was changed to a Robin engine and then later the Cuyuna 215. The KFM 107e engine has also been used. Operational history Within two months of the aircraft's introduction in 1982, 50 to 60 sets of plans had been sold. In March 2011 there were seven Solitaires registered in the United States, including one in the EAA AirVenture Museum.

It won the first Phoenix Award in 1985. It takes place in Roman Britain and tells the tale of a gladiator who becomes involved with the Dal Riada of Earra-Ghàidheal. Like many Sutcliff novels, the plot is driven by a crisis of leadership, hinging on acceptance of the ultimate responsibility of a sacrificial king. Plot summary The story revolves around slave-gladiator Red Phaedrus, a red haired half Roman, half Celt. He receives his wooden-foil, i.e. his freedom after winning a fight-to- the-death in the arena of Corstopitum (the most northerly town in the Roman Empire). He is soon after approached by representatives of the Dal Riada, who ask him to impersonate their king in an effort to win back tribal leadership from a usurper queen. Phaedrus is persuaded, accepts the role of Midir, the original prince whose eyes were put out by the queen, preventing him from ruling, and receives a signifying tattoo on his forehead, the eponymous Mark of the Horse Lord. The stage is then set for a struggle between King and Queen, between Dal Riada and Caledones, between the Sun God and the Great Mother; a theme used in many Sutcliff novels.Article about Rosemary Sutcliff at the Historical Novels Info website; paragraph 15. Phaedrus spends time in a town on the Northern Wall, learning his role from the original prince Midir and the culture of the Celts. Several historical subjects are discussed, including Lollius Urbicus and the laying-waste of Valentia after subjugation, the Pax Romana and its effects, Calgacus's battles against General Agricola, and the viewpoints of Tacitus on all of this. A revolt ensues against the Queen, and the Dal Riada capital of Dun Monaidh is retaken, but the queen escapes to her kin amongst the Caledones. Phaedrus is crowned king in a ceremony where he places one foot on the carved footprint of previous kings. He lives among the Dal Riada, developing trust and understanding with some who recognise him for an impostor, most who do not. A war ensues between the Dal Riada and the Caledones, who are portrayed as Picts. The fighting occurs across the countryside around Cruachan (described as the Shield boss of the World), as the Dal Riada struggle to defend their frontier. Other geographical features encountered include Loch Abha, Loch Fhiona, the Cluta, the Firth of the War Boats, and Glen Croe. The Dal Riada eventually win, the Caledones are dispersed, but the Queen flees and finds refuge in a Roman frontier fort. An attempt to assassinate the Queen is made with the help of the true Midir, in which both die, and Phaedrus is captured by the Romans. He is offered freedom at a great cost to the Dal Riada, referencing back to the discussions of Pax Romana and Roman treatment of the native tribes. Phaedrus instead opts to sacrifice himself for the survival of his adopted people, punctuating the concept of responsibility and the sacrificial king developed throughout the novel. The theme of the novel is built around an individual struggling to find identify and belonging, similar to Sutcliff novels such as Outcast and Dawn Wind, revolving around conflicting cultures, and the duties assumed and performed by individuals within those cultures. The duties of a king are shown in many of her novels, including Sword at Sunset and Sun Horse, Moon Horse, and have been credited as being influenced by James Frazer's The Golden Bough.Historical Novel Society: Rosemary Sutcliff The novel also contains elements of Anthony Hope's earlier Ruritanian novel of a substitute prince, The Prisoner of Zenda. The red hair of both substituting heroes is just one of the resemblances. Awards The Mark of the Horse Lord won the inaugural, 1985 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major contemporary award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.

The apse of the church is visible behind some rocks. The Church of St John the Baptist (, tsarkva „Sveti Yoan Krastitel“), also known as the Church of St John the Precursor or, locally, Sveti Yani or Sveti Yan, is a small medieval Eastern Orthodox church in the town of Asenovgrad in Plovdiv Province, south central Bulgaria. The church is located on a cliff west of the town and dates to the 12th–14th centuries. Its exterior is decorated with many blind arches, while its interior features mostly frescoes from the 18th century, with some fragments of 14th-century murals. Its high position and the arrowslits on the north wall made the church suitable as a defensive outpost. Location and history The Church of St John the Baptist, known to the locals as Sveti Yani or Sveti Yan, is located on a high cliff on the western outskirts of Asenovgrad, which belong to the old town. To allow its construction, the terrain around its foundations had to be reinforced. The church lies close to several less ancient chapels, such as Saint Barbara's, Saint George's and Chapel of the Entry of the Most Holy Mother of God into the Temple. Nearby are also a 17th-century water fountain and remains of medieval fortifications which date to the 11th–13th century. Together, these buildings contribute to that part of Asenovgrad's medieval atmosphere. The church has not been conclusively dated. Art historian André Grabar placed it in the 14th century, scholar Nikola Mavrodinov dated it to the 13th century, while archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev is of the opinion that both theories are equally likely. Architecture writer Stefan Stamov gives a possible range from the 12th to the 14th century. The Church of St John the Baptist belonged to the northern fortifications of medieval Asenovgrad (then known in Greek as Stenimachos). It was in continuous operation until the late 18th or early 19th century, when it suffered significant damage, perhaps during Ottoman brigand raids. During the reconstruction works which were carried out soon thereafter, the roof and the upper parts of the church were modified. The interior was also repainted at the time. The church has been protected as a national antiquity since 1940; in 1970, it was enlisted among Bulgaria's monuments of culture of national importance. The church was reconstructed in the 2000s by a team under architect Stoycho Maronov. The restoration efforts restored the windows, the interior frescoes and the iconostasis, and took 42 days. Architecture and decoration The Church of St John the Baptist is relatively small, measuring or , with a height of around . In terms of design, it follows the Byzantine cross-in-square style. The church lacks a narthex and features a single triangular apse with three small windows in its eastern part. The wall which carries the iconostasis clearly divides the interior into a cella and an altar. The altar includes a prothesis and a diaconicon, which are housed in bays in the east wall. The church was built out of interchanging rows of stones and brickwork, without any ceramic facing. Blind arches form an important part of the church's exterior decoration: there are five each on the north and south walls, with an additional three on the west wall. The walls are around thick. In its architecture, the church closely resembles other medieval religious buildings in its close surroundings, most notably the Church of the Holy Mother of God in Asen's Fortress south of Asenovgrad and the ossuary of the Bachkovo Monastery. However, the Church of St John the Baptist is unique in that it is the only one of the three to feature arrowslits. Six arrowslits on the north wall enabled the church to be quickly converted into a defensive tower. Most of the surviving frescoes on the church's interior walls date from the 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, all painted as part of the church's first reconstruction. However, restoration works carried out in the 2000s have uncovered 14th-century murals depicting the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary as well as John the Baptist.

Its world premiere was at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women. The film grew out of an initiative by the FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, with additional support from the Rockefeller Foundation and UNICEF. The film's purpose was to address, as Robertson puts it, \\"the elephant in the room\\" about girls in school and allow for discussion of attitudes about the effect of education on African girls and their societies. It is currently used for training within the Peace Corps who, in statements, have described the film as \\"rich in its learning opportunities as well as being beautifully filmed.\\"  Synopsis  \\"A film about men and women, about marriage... families... having babies, about tradition, and the modern world... about who goes to school in Africa... and why girls are missing.\\" - Official tag-line. Every year, girls in African schools \\"go missing,\\" from school classrooms. This film analyzes the stories of five schoolgirls and examines the causes and consequences of the high dropout rates among girls. The stories are told directly by Malawian and Guinean girls and their families.http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/810ee710-87ef-4011-8786-f006a9f30c65-1995.pdf * Part I: Nadouba and Bintu in the West-African village of Gbonko, Guinea. * Part II: Ethel and her mother, in Muluma village, Malawi. * Part III: Taz and Patricia from elite St. Mary’s Secondary School in Zomba, Malawi. Also presented is a group of elders from a Malinké village conversing about the issue. Release These Girls Are Missing was initially commissioned by FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, and premiered at the United Nations’ 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Because of its wide range of intended audiences, the film is available in seven languages: English, French, Malinké, Susu, Poular, Ki-Swahili and Chichewa. Since its release, the film has been distributed widely by the Ministries of Education in both Guinea and Malawi, and used in focus groups and workshops promoting girls’ education. FAWE also distributed the film unto associate members in Ministries of Education in Zanzibar, Angola, Cameroon, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Seychelles, Botswana, São Tomé e Principe, Mozambique, Uganda and Ghana.http://www.epidavros.org/ss/our_work/projects/these_girls_are_missing?page=2 The film has also screened at Cinema du Reel, Paris; CIES (Comparative and International Education Society) Conference, Buffalo, NY; Marymount Manhattan College, NY; and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University. It has also been screened for the U.S. State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, Inter-American Development Bank, World Council for Comparative Education Societies and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The Girls Know it The filmmakers also produced a shorter version of the film called The Girls Know It, released in 1997. It is hosted, on screen, by The Honorable Aicha Bah, Minister of Education in Guinea. The film is shorter, at 47 minutes and was released in 1997. It is available in seven languages as well. This 47-minute cut is available in the same seven languages as the 60-minute film. Educational Use UNICEF, USAID, and the Peace Corps have made extensive use of These Girls Are Missing as a training and education tool. Critical reception The film received the Cine Golden Eagle under the Documentary Feature categoryhttp://www.cine.org/archives/winner-archives/pdfs/1996-CINE-Winner- Directory.pdf and a Silver Plaque as part of the 31st annual Chicago International Film Festival.

Since social capital is built of trust, rules, norms and networks, it can be said that the social capital of communities has grown. The lower entrance barriers to the community have made it easier to be a part of many different communities. This goes hand in hand with Don Tapscott's theory of how the digital society has changed collaboration and innovation to a world of co- creation.Tapscott (2007) From birth to death, people are shaped by the communities to which they belong, affecting everything from how they talk to whom they talk with.Preece (2000) Just like the telephone and the television changed the way people interact socially, computers have transformed communication and at the same time created new norms for social capital. \\"A virtual community is a group of people who may or may not meet one another face to face, who exchange words and ideas through the mediation of computer bulletin board systems and other digital networks\\".Encyclopædia Britannica (2011) Along with the fact that computer usage has spread, the use of virtual communities have grown. Rheingold defines virtual communities as \\"social aggregations that emerge from the Net when enough people carry on those public discussions long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace\\". Michael Porter describes a virtual community as \\"an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least partially supported and/or mediated by technology and guided by some protocols or norms\\".Porter (2001) Virtual communities consist of \\"people with shared interests or goals for whom electronic communication is a primary form of interaction\\" and have created new forms of collaboration.Dennis, Pootheri, Natarajan (1998) \\"The most skilled and experienced members of the community provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community as a whole. This way, virtual communities can use the voluntary motivations that exist in a community to assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional forms\\". According to Benkler, we can \\"see a thickening of the preexisting relations with friends and family, in particular with those who were hard to reach earlier\\".Benkler (2006) \\"Also, we are beginning to see the emergence of a greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships. Although these may not fit the ideal model of virtual communities, they are effective and meaningful to their participants\\". The heightened individual capacity that actually is a driving social force have raised concerns by many that the Internet is further fragmenting the community, making people spend their time in front of their computer instead of socializing with each other. Empirical studies show, however, that we are using the Internet and communities on the expense of television, and that is an exchange that promotes social ties. Social capital Social capital is a concept built from the premise that some value emanates from social networking sites due to the social interaction which may have positive influence in the society of the individuals who belong to the group by facilitating coordinated actions (Putnam et al., 1993).Putnam et al. (1993) Simply put, social capital is “the ability of people to work together for some common purpose” (Rosenfeld, 1997). Trust, rules, norms and networks create social capital (Barr, 2000), Narayan (1997).Barr (2000) =Evaluation= A number of innovative ways have been employed to measure social capital, however, there is not a one true way of measuring it. First, the most comprehensive definitions of social capital are multidimensional, incorporating different levels and units of analysis. Second, any attempt to measure the properties of inherently ambiguous concepts such as \\"community\\", \\"network\\" and \\"organization\\" is correspondingly problematic. Third, few long-standing surveys were designed to measure \\"social capital\\", leaving contemporary researchers to compile indexes from a range of approximate items, such as measures of trust in government, voting trends, memberships in civic organizations, hours spent volunteering. New surveys currently being tested will hopefully produce more direct and accurate indicators. Measuring social capital may be difficult, but it is not impossible, and several excellent studies have identified useful proxies for social capital, using different types and combinations of qualitative, comparative and quantitative research methodologies . Knack and Keefer (1997) used indicators of trust and civic norms from the World Values Survey for a sample of 29 market economies.Knack and Keefer (1997) They used these measures as proxies for the strength of civic associations in order to test two different propositions on the effects of social capital on economic growth, the \\"Olson effects\\" (associations stifle growth through rent-seeking) and \\"Putnam effects\\" (associations facilitate growth by increasing trust). Inglehart (1997) has done the most extensive work on the implications of the WVS's results for general theories of modernization and development.Inglehart (1997) Narayan and Pritchett (1997) construct a measure of social capital in rural Tanzania, using data from the Tanzania Social Capital and Poverty Survey (SCPS).Narayan (1997) This large-scale survey asked individuals about the extent and characteristics of their associational activity, and their trust in various institutions and individuals. They match this measure of social capital with data on household income in the same villages (both from the SCPS and from an earlier household survey, the Human Resources Development Survey). They find that village-level social capital raises household incomes. Temple and Johnson (1998), extending the earlier work of Adelman and Morris (1967), use ethnic diversity, social mobility, and the prevalence of telephone services in several sub-Saharan African countries as proxies for the density of social networks. They combine several related items into an index of \\"social capability\\", and show that this can explain significant amounts of variation in national economic growth rates.Temple (1998)Adelman and Morris(1967) Measuring social capital may be difficult, but it is not impossible, and several excellent studies have identified useful proxies for social capital, using different types and combinations of qualitative, comparative and quantitative research methodologies (Woolcock and Narayan, 2000).Woolcock and Narayan (2000) How we measure social capital depends on how we define it. The most comprehensive definitions of social capital are multidimensional, incorporating different levels and units of analysis. Trust, civic engagement, and community involvement are generally seen as ways to measure social capital. Depending on the definition of social capital and the context, some indicators may be more appropriate than others. Once it has been decided which how social capital is to be measured, for example by measuring civic engagement through household surveys, cultural factors may be taken into account in designing the survey instrument. Newspaper readership may be a better indicator of civic engagement in Italy (Putnam, 1993) than in India because of the varying literacy rates. Measuring social capital among the poor, particularly studying the same households over time, is difficult because the poor are often involved in informal work, may not have a long-term address or may move. Robert D. Putnam (2000) suggested a social capital concepts of bonding and bridging. Bonding is viewed as relations among members of the same community. Bridging is viewed as relationships between members among different communities.Putnam (2000) =Influences on communities= Business 'cluster' is “used to represent concentrations of firms that are able to produce synergy because of their geographic proximity and interdependence” (Rosenfeld, 1997).Rosenfeld (1997) Steinfield, C. et al. (2010) found, that “the amount of perceived social capital significantly predicted market exposure” of company performance in a knowledge-intensive business cluster. Social capital strengthens regional production networks.Steinfield, et al. (2010) The rate of networking (defined as various forms of strategic alliances and joint ventures) generally reflects the levels of social capital and trust that exists (Rosenfeld, 1997). Robert Putnam (1993) found that stock of social capital predicts economic performance. There is some evidence suggesting that social relationships play an important role in the survival of small businesses (Granovetter, 1984), yet the relative contribution of other factors, such as managerial skills and environmental context are unknown.Granovetter (1984) At the institutional level, disciplinary climate and academic norms established by the school community and the mutual trust between home and school are major forms of social capital. These forms of social capital are found to contribute to student learning outcomes in East Asian countries such as Singapore, Korea, and Hong Kong. They have been shown to have a significant impact, not only on creating a learning and caring school climate, but also on improving the quality of schooling and reducing inequality of learning outcomes between social-class groups. Information and communication technologies (ICT) affect various aspects of communities, including communications, social capital, friendships and trust. Internet has the most influence on communities due to its interactive nature and wide usage. According to Katz, Rice, Aspden (2001) “Internet has unique, even transformational qualities as a communication channel, including relative anonymity and the ability to easily link with others who have similar interests, values, and beliefs”.Katz, Rice, Aspden (2001) Internet, and computer-mediated communication supports and accelerates ways how people operate at the centers of partial, personal communities, and switching rapidly and frequently between different groups (Wellman, 1996).Wellman (1996) Internet usage is associated with positive and negative aspects for communities. For example, Bargh and McKenna (2004) claim that “Internet use does not appear to weaken the fabric of neighborhoods and communities”. Galston (1999) claims, that Internet is “capable of promoting a kind of socialization and moral learning through mutual adjustment”.Galston (1999) Kavanaugh and Patterson (2001) did not find that increased Internet usage increased community involvement and attachment. According to Gilleard, C. et al. (2007), “ownership and use of domestic information and communication technology reduces the sense of attachment to the local neighborhood among individuals 50 and older in England.” But they continue that “domestic information and communication technology may be more liberating of neighborhood boundedness than destructive of social capital.”Kavanaugh and Patterson (2001) Anonymity is often mentioned in popular media as a possible cause for negative effects. But according to Bargh and McKenna (2004), anonymity also associated with positive effects: “research has found that the relative anonymity aspect encourages self-expression, and the relative absence of physical and nonverbal interaction cues (e.g., attractiveness) facilitates the formation of relationships on other, deeper bases such as shared values and beliefs.”Bargh and McKenna (2004) Pigg and Crank (2004) suggest how Internet can facilitate interaction within members of community.Pigg and Crank (2004) They suggest a concept of “reciprocity transaction”, that implies that “one person provides something of value to another in expectation that, at some point in time, the other person will act similarly”. It is suggested that ICT supports reciprocity transaction by providing social support or valuable information not available to public, and share meaning. Shared presence combined with depth of information provides shared meaning (Miranda and Saunders, 2003).Miranda and Saunders (2003) Internet usage is generally not associated with decline in social contact. For example, Katz, Rice, Aspden (2001) found that Internet users were more likely to communicate with others through other media (especially telephone) more than do nonusers, and Internet use was associated with greater levels of social interaction (although this was more widely dispersed). Thy claim, that “Internet use does not appear to weaken the fabric of neighborhoods and communities.” Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) claim that online interactions do not necessarily remove people from their offline world, but support relationships, especially when life changes move them away from each other. They say, that Internet “seems well- suited to social software applications because it enables users to maintain such ties cheaply and easily”.Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) Internet- based communications is usually cheaper than phone, fax and letter-based communications, and are regarded as cheap to keep up with family and friends abroad (Foley, 2004), to keep up with business friends (e.g. Molony, 2009).Foley (2004)Molony (2009) Galston (1999) suggested an approach to analyze virtual communities based on entry and exist costs: “when barriers to leaving old groups and joining new ones are relatively low, exit will tend to be the preferred option; as these costs rise, the exercise of voice becomes more likely.” He suggested, that “exit [from community] will be the predominant response to dissatisfaction”. Also, “virtual communities do not promote the development of voice; because they emphasize personal choice, they do not acknowledge the need for authority”, and do not foster mutual obligation. =Influences on family, friends and neighbors = Positive Internet usage on relationships between family members and friends were found. For example, Bargh and McKenna (2004) wrote that “Internet, mainly through e-mail, has facilitated communication and thus close ties between family and friends, especially those too far away to visit in person on a regular basis”. ICT helps to create friendships. “When Internet-formed relationships get close enough (i.e., when sufficient trust has been established), people tend to bring them into their “real world”—that is, the traditional face-to-face and telephone interaction sphere” (Bargh, McKenna, 2004.) “Internet facilitates new connections, in that it provides people with an alternative way to connect with others who share their interests or relational goals” (Ellison, Heino, & Gibbs, 2006).Ellison, Heino, & Gibbs(2006) Cummings, Lee and Kraut (2006) found that students who move off to college “communicating with these friends prevents the relationships from declining as swiftly as they otherwise would. Communication seems to inject energy into a relationship and prevents it from going dormant.” Email and instant messaging are found to be especially useful.Cummings, Lee and Kraut (2006) Hampton and Wellman (2001) found that, in a wired community, many neighbors got to know each other better through the use of a local computer network.Hampton and Wellman (2001) But according to Katz (2001), “use of the Internet per se is not associated with different levels of awareness of one’s neighbors”. =Influences on social network= Social networks play increasingly larger role for Internet users. According to Castells (1999), “social networks substitute for communities, with locally based communities being one of the many possible alternatives for the creation and maintenance of social networks, and the Internet providing another such alternative.”Castells (1999) Social networks provide possibilities to create new relationships, and to maintain existing ones. According to Lampe, Ellison, Steinfield (2007), users of a popular social network Facebook mainly use the network to learn more about people they meet offline, and are less inclined to initiate new connections: “Facebook members seem to be using Facebook as a surveillance tool for maintaining previous relationships, and as a “social search” tool by which they investigate people they've met offline”. Connections formed online sometimes are transformed to off-line personal relationships. Parks and Floyd (1996) report that 60% of their random sample “reported that they had formed a personal relationship of some kind with someone they had first contacted through a newsgroup”, and that “relationships that begin on line rarely stay there”.Parks and Floyd (1996) Privacy issues are commonly reported in popular media. According to Gross and Acquisti (2005), “many individuals in a person’s online extended network would hardly be defined as actual friends by that person; in fact many may be complete strangers.Gross and Acquisti (2005) And yet, personal and often sensitive information is freely and publicly provided.” Therefore, users potentially expose themselves to physical and cyber risks. =Influences on social capital= Internet usage can cause multiple effects for social capital, and its effects are not yet clear. For example, Pigg & Crank (2004) suggest that studies of relationship between online networks and social capital is still too much in their infancy to reach any useful conclusions. Although it is generally thought that Internet affects social capital, “mechanisms are unclear” (Hampton, Wellman, 1999).Hampton, Wellman (1999) Internet usage can both increase and decrease social capital: “people engage in social and asocial activities when online” (Hampton, Wellman, 1999). For example, Nie (2001) claims that social capital can be decreased: “Internet use may actually reduce interpersonal interaction and communication”.Nie (2001) He also claims, that “Internet users do not become more sociable; rather, they already display a higher degree of social connectivity and participation”. Hampton, Wellman (1999) claims, that “increased connectivity and involvement not only can expose people to more contact and more information, it can reduce commitment to community”, because “immersiveness can turn people away from community”. Some researchers claim that social capital can be increased by Internet usage. For example, Ellison, Heino, & Gibbs (2006) claim that “Internet facilitates new connections, in that it provides people with an alternative way to connect with others who share their interests or relational goals”. Hampton, Wellman (1999) state that Internet supplements network capital “by extending existing levels of face-to-face and telephone contact.” Reduction of communication costs increase the frequency and duration of communication, and increase social capital's bonding and bridging. The Net is particularly suited to the development of multiple weak ties (Castells, 1999), thus expanding sociability beyond the socially defined boundaries of self-recognition. Internet supports weak ties between individuals, which can the foundation for bridging social capital (Ellison, Steinfieldm, Lampe, 2007). Resnick (2001) suggests that with the help of new technologies (e.g. distribution lists, photo directories, search) new forms of social capital occurs in online social network sites.Resnick (2001) Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) suggest that intensity of Facebook use is positively associated with individuals’ perceived bridging social capital: for undergraduate students, there is a “strong association between use of Facebook and the three types of social capital, with the strongest relationship being to bridging social capital. According to Williams (2006), because of the low costs of communication, there might be more of the bridging function online than offline.Williams (2006) \\"The social capital created by these networks generates broader identities and generalized reciprocity\\". Williams (2006) suggested Internet Social Capital Scales (ICST) to measure social capital bridging and bonding. Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) assessed social capital bonding by using ICST, and found, that “Facebook is indeed implicated in students’ efforts to develop and maintain bridging social capital at college, although we cannot assess causal direction.” Intensity of Facebook use was positively associated with individuals’ perceived bonding social capital (Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, 2007). But they also found, that bonding social capital was also predicted by high self-esteem, satisfaction with university life, as with use of Facebook. Therefore, high self-esteem, and satisfaction with university life are likely causes of perceived bonding social capital, and heavier Facebook use. Friends use the Internet to maintain ties. “Internet is particularly useful for keeping contact among friends who are socially and geographically dispersed. ... Distance still matters: communication is lower with distant than nearby friends” (Hampton, Wellman, 1999).

George Thomas d'Aguilar having secured a commission on the Bengal Establishment of the Honourable East India Company's service, left England and was posted to the 13th Madras Native Infantry and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 29 May 1800. He eventually died in Calcutta on 9 October 1839.

Rugby union career D'Aguilar played rugby for the Royal Engineers within the army and made his international debut on 5 February 1872 in front of 4,000 spectators at The Oval in the England vs Scotland match. This was the second time the teams had met and in fact the second international match, as well as being the first time England had hosted an international rugby match. England won the match, a reversal of the previous year's result in Scotland. In this 1872 meeting Scotland opened the scoring with a drop goal from Cathcart. England responded through Hamersley touching down for a try. In itself, the try was not worth any points, but afforded England a \\"try at goal\\" and this was converted by Francis Isherwood. England then scored a dropgoal from the boot of Freeman in the second half. England continued to dominate and Francis d'Aguilar himself scored a try but Isherwood failed to convert d'Aguilar's try, thus no points were scored. Finney's try for England was also not converted. However, England prevailed by two goals to one, with two extra tries.Francis Marshall, Football, the Rugby Union game, p144-146, (Cassell:London), 1892 Shortly after his international appearance he was posted to India and spent much of his life there.

Facts Mr Holland set up several composite companies that paid salaries and dividends to its contractors as if they were employees and nonvoting shareholders, so as to reduce the amount of tax they paid, but not load them with the administrative burdens if they set up themselves as companies. However the tax scheme failed because the result of the share structure was that Holland was in control of them and they were associated for tax purposes, each was liable for high corporation tax and the companies went insolvent. Holland was the director of another company which itself was the director of those companies, and the Revenue was the sole remaining creditor. It claimed Holland was liable under Insolvency Act 1986 section 212 to account for dividends as they were misapplied or Holland was guilty of misfeasance or breach of fiduciary duty, and for that Holland needed to be treated as a de facto director. Judgment Lord Hope, Lord Collins and Lord Saville held that because the parent company and Holland were separate legal persons, simply acting as a director of a corporate director was not enough to make Holland a de facto director. Holland needed to have assumed responsibility in relation to the subject companies, but he had only discharged his duties as director. If he was the \\"guiding mind\\" then that would be true in all cases of corporate directors. Lord Walker and Lord Clarke dissented and would have held that if Holland deliberately procured dividend payments he was a de facto director of the composite companies and owed them a fiduciary duty.

Gowsell hit the men's competitive curling world by storm in the late 1970s with his unorthodox antics. Playing career Gowsell was the first skip to win two World Junior Curling Championships. He won his first World Junior championship in 1976, defeating Sweden's Jan Ullsten. He repeated in 1978 by defeating Sweden again, this time skipped by Thomas Håkansson. Gowsell was the third skip to win two Canadian Junior Men's Championships which he did in 1975 and 1978. After juniors, Gowsell was very successful on the cash 'spiel circuit, but played in just one Brier. When he was in his early 20s, Gowsell took his Alberta championship team to an 8-3 record at the 1980 Labatt Brier, and lost to Al Hackner's Northern Ontario team in the semi-final. Gowsell to date has not returned to the Brier, but has played some competitive events since, most recently at the Alberta provincial seniors curling championship in 2010. On January 5, 2013, Gowsell made a return to men's playdown curling, qualifying for the Alberta Southerns (a qualifier for the Boston Pizza Cup) for the first time in numerous years. He teamed up with former Junior Alberta Provincial Champion, Mike Sali, his son, Sam Gowsell, and young up and coming lead Jamie Cochrane.http://apps.saca.ca/pdm/Playdowns/ViewTreesWrapper/38 Antics Gowsell was considered the \\"rebel of the curling world\\" in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Rumour has it that he never washed them.\\" In those days, he sported long hair and a beard; Hec Gervais once commented about Gowsell that, \\"with a shave and two haircuts, he'd be alright.\\" In a game against Saskatchewan's Larry McGrath, Gowsell was known to have ordered a pizza to the game. Gowsell's team ate the pizza on the ice, and according to legend, McGrath's last stone picked on an olive from the pizza, losing him the game. Gowsell's teams were also credited with popularizing the use of the \\"pushbroom\\" in the sport. His teams revolutionized sweeping techniques in the sport, taking advantage of the chaff left on the ice by most of their competitors who had been using the \\"Blackjack\\" style of corn brooms prior to the Gowsell successes at the championship levels.

Hendon Publishing offers four distinct business-to- government publications: LAW and ORDER, Tactical Response, Public Safety IT and Police Fleet Manager – and two expositions – Police Fleet Expo and Police Fleet Expo-West. History Law and Order Magazine, the company's flagship publication, was started in 1953 on Long Island, New York, at the Copp Organization. From the very first issue, William Copp tried to produce a publication that would be useful to the police department administrator of the day. Not a theoretical discussion of what policing should look like in the future. This was truly a how-to magazine for police department administrators who had little or no formal education in Criminal Justice. Most police officers in the 1950s did not graduate from high school and advanced by moving up the ranks from patrolman. Under the guidance of Editor-in-Chief Lee Lawler, Law and Order was able to produce useful content from experts in the field. The first issue of the publication even carried a guest editorial from then Georgia Governor Herman Talmadge, who was embroiled in controversy over his segregationist policies. The civil rights demonstrations from those days continue to affect policing today. In the early 1960s, Lawler left the company and was replaced by Frank G. MacAloon. MacAloon, who used a wheelchair, continued to guide the publication successfully until 1979. During his tenure, Mr. MacAloon continued to seek out editorial guests to comment on issues of the day. The protests of the sixties brought policing into a specific light as never before. Television news brought nightly pictures of protesters engaged with police both violently and non-violently. Law and Order magazine was there to guide police departments on how to properly train their officers and avoid nasty confrontations. Mr. MacAloon also oversaw the explosion of illicit drugs in America during the 1970s, when police had to utilize many new techniques to combat the massive influx of illegal narcotics. Again, Law and Order Magazine was there educating administrators on new tools and techniques to combat a problem that had not existed 20 years prior. At one point in the late 1970s, Law and Order carried a guest editorial from then Arkansas Governor William J. Clinton who eventually became President of the United States. From the very beginning in 1953, H. Scott Kingwill, the eventual founder of Hendon Publishing Company, was working as an advertising salesman at the Copp Organization focusing primarily on Law and Order Magazine. During those early years, the publication carried advertising from Metcalf Uniform, Federal Signal and Midland Radio to name a few. In 1978, Mr. Copp, who was looking to retire, sold Law and Order Magazine to Kingwill. At the time, Kingwill was also running a successful forensic equipment supply business, Ace Fingerprint Company, on Elston Avenue in Chicago, IL. In early 1979 Mr. Kingwill moved the magazine headquarters from Long Island to Chicago. At that same time Mr. Kingwill hired Bruce Cameron, a Public Relations executive with Bell & Howell, to become the new Editorial Director of Law and Order. Currently, Hendon is headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois and is under the co-ownership of Peter C. Kingwill and Henry S. Kingwill.

An example of this is the use of social media in the 2011 Wisconsin protests over public unions that occurred during February and March 2011. Both sides of this debate used various social media networks to get their message out, in an attempt to convince others to join their cause. Many organizations around the country joined this use of social media to voice their own opinions about labor issues in Wisconsin. With the use of these mediums, this issue quickly went from a state issue to one on the national and even international stage. Positions =Pro-union= The Pro-Union side used many forms of social media, attempting to sway public opinion and to organize protests. The group called \\"Wisconsin Students for Solidarity\\" organized a national student walkout, via a Facebook page, to take place on March 11. An attorney named Bill Mahler decided to close his law firm early on March 11 as well, to show support for the Unions. With the use of his blog, and Twitter account, he was able to get the message out in an attempt to convince other law firms to do the same. The interesting part was that Mahler's firm was not located in Wisconsin, but in Seattle, Washington. This shows that the internet, and social media, allow issues confined to geographic areas, the ability to take a national or world-wide stage. These protests, and actions, have had positive effects in other states for opponents of the bill in Wisconsin. Indiana Republicans recently dropped a similar bill, under pressure from Indiana Democrats and other union supporters. =Governor Walker and supporters = Governor Scott Walker used Twitter to state his ideas, communicate with those who agreed with him and allow those who did not, to respond. Some of the tweets have even been looked at as actively negotiating with the Unions, by some writers. His supporters used the same types of social media to drum up support, around not only Wisconsin, but the entire nation, just as the opposition had done. One website, \\"americansforprosperity.org,\\" had a petition set up on their website, available for those who agreed with Walker, to sign. This site also had Twitter updates and a link to a Facebook page. Other major political figures have also used the internet to voice their support for the governor. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty posted a video and started a petition on his website. Also, former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, posted a public appeal on a conservative website.

Lynn. \\"Designing Services that Deliver\\", Harvard Business Review, vol. 62, no. 1 January - February 1984, pp 133–139 The service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The service blueprint has become one of the most widely used tools to manage service operations, service design and service positioning. Elements A simple way to think about blueprints is as a process chart which consists of inputs, process and outputs. ::: Inputs (raw materials) → Process (transformation) → Outputs (finished goods) Service blueprints include actions and the amount of discretion for varying each step A service blueprint is always constructed from the customer's perspective. A typical service blueprint identifies:Zeithmal, V. A. and Bitner, M.J., Services Marketing, Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996 *Customer Actions: The steps that customers take as part of the service delivery process. *Front-stage (Visible Contact Employee) Actions: Steps taken by contact employees as part of the face-to-face service encounter. *Back-stage (Invisible Contact Employee) Actions: (The 'line of visibility' separates the front-stage and back-stage actions). Non-visible steps taken by contact employees behind the line of visibility. e.g. taking a hotel or restaurant reservation by telephone. *Support Processes: Activities carried out by employees who are not contact employees, but whose actions are required for the service to be delivered. *Physical Evidence: Tangible elements associated with each step that has the potential to influence customer perceptions of the service encounter e.g. uniforms, delivery vans * Inventory (if required): the amount of inventory build up required for each step * Line of Visibility: Line that separates front-stage and back-stage actions Optional inclusions – depending on intended application:Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M. (2004) \\"Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently,\\" Journal of Business Research, vol. 57, no. 4, pp 392-404 * Line of Interaction which separates customer actions from service provider actions * Line of Internal Interaction which separates the back office and the support process * Line of Implementation which separates management zone from the support zone. That is management are responsible for planning and controlling while support activities include preparation. Yet other scholars and practitioners have recommended adding different lines including * Line of Order Penetration which separates customer-induced activities from customer-independent activities * Minimum expected wait times * Potential bottlenecks and/or fail pointsZeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D., Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm, 4th ed, McGraw-Hill Irwin, Boston, Mass. 2006  Evolution  The service blueprint has become one of the most useful tools in the services marketer's repertoire. Since its original development, a number of scholars have sought to increase its usefulness by adding various modifications that provide additional information and more demarcations. Zeithaml and Bitner recommend adding four lines to the map. (1) the Line of Visibility (as in the original); (2) the Line of Interaction which separates customer actions from service provider actions (3) the Line of Internal Interaction which separates the front office and the back office and (4) the Line of Implementation which separates management zone from the support zone.Zeithmal, V. A. and Bitner, M.J., Services Marketing, Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996 The addition of these lines helps to separate the functions of planning and controlling from support activities including preparation. Yet other scholars and practitioners have recommended adding different lines including (5) the Line of Order Penetration which separates customer-induced activities from customer-independent activities.Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M., \\"Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently,\\" Journal of Business Research, vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, pp 392-404 Lovelock, Patterson, and Walker (2001) suggest that the service blueprint may also be useful for specifying the level of variation from standards that would be tolerated at each step of the process without affecting customers' perceptions of quality and timeliness.Lovelock, C.H., Patterson, P.G. and Walker, R.H., Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, French's Forest, NSW, Prentice-Hall, 2001, p. 226 Zeithaml, Bitner and Gremler (2006) also recommended adding bottlenecks and fail points to the map. A bottleneck is a point in the system at which consumers waiting time is likely to exceed average or minimum tolerable expectations. A fail point is any point within the encounter that has potential to affect customer satisfaction or quality.Zeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D. (2006), Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm, 4th ed, Boston, MA, McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2006 These additions increase the diagnostic value of the service blueprint. Applications Service blueprinting has three main applications: simple representation; diagnosing operational deficiencies and service design (planning for structural change or new service development). : (1) Simple Representation : A basic application for blueprints is as a simple form of representing or codifying what is actually occurring in the current operation. In visual form, the blueprint can be used in training programs, employee manuals to help clarify service processes. Blueprints may be used in market research as a means of helping respondents to visualise aspects of a service that may be the focus of an investigation.Shostack, G.L> \\"How to Design a Service\\", European Journal of Marketing, vol. 16 no. 1, 1993, pp. 49–63 Blueprints can also be used in employee training programs and manuals to assist staff to visualise the service process and the relationships between steps in the process. : (2) Diagnosing Operational Deficiencies : Blueprints have also found widespread applications as diagnostic tools designed to uncover operational weaknesses. A number of scholars have championed the diagnostic value of blueprints.Lovelock, C. H., \\"Managing Interactions Between Operations and Marketing and their Impact on Customers,\\" in Bowen, D.E. Chase, R.B. and Cummings, T.G. (eds), Service Management Effectiveness. Balancing Strategy, organization and Human Resources, San Francisco, 1990, pp 343-69Swank, C. K., \\"The Lean Service Machine, Harvard Business Review, vol. 81 no, 10, 2003 : The blueprint can be analysed in terms of the appropriateness of physical evidence provided at each contact point as well as the suitability of contact personnel in relation to activities. In the event that any deficiencies are identified by the blueprinting process, management can develop operational standards for critical steps in the process.Womack, J. P. and Jones, D. T. , \\"Lean Consumption,\\" Harvard Business Review, vol. 83, no. 3, 2005, pp 58–68 : (3) Service design: Planning for Structural Change/ New Service Development : Shostack's original intention was that blueprinting be used as a planning tool.Shostack, G. L., \\"Service Positioning through Structural Change,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43 Using a simple diagrammatic representation of the process, management could pose \\"What if?\\" type scenarios and reconfigure the service process in the blueprint form, without causing major disruptions in real time. For example, a planner might ask, What if we give employees wider latitude? What if we reduce latitude by scripting every step? What if we reduce complexity by combining two or more steps into a single procedure? What if we add complexity by having different contact staff take responsibility for each step? Building a blueprint The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact – whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process. A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight. Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process. The process of structuring a blueprint involves between five and seven steps, depending on the intended application.Wilson Alan/ Zeithaml, Valerie A./ Bitner, Mary Jo/ Gremler, Dwayne D. (2008): Services Marketing: Integrating Customers Focus Across the Firm, Glasgow, 2008. (p. 203-206) From the outset, the blueprint was designed to be seen from the customer's perspective while simultaneously providing insights for management. Accordingly, the starting point should be to imagine the customer's step-by- step contact points, indicating, where known, customer's expectations in terms of minimum tolerable waiting times for each step. Symbols typically used in service blueprints Basic Service Blueprint # Identify activities, sequence of activities and linkages between activities. Activities include #: (a) customer actions #: (b) front stage contact personnel actions #: (c) back stage contact personnel actions #: (d) support activities # Identify line of visibility and add to blueprint. # Identify standards and tolerances, scripts, operating procedures, supporting services and inventory for each step and add to blueprint. # If required, draw additional lines such as line of physical interaction and line of IT interaction (optional, but recommended for complex services). # Specify timeframes. Show average timing or minimum tolerable customer expectations for each step and indicate responsible personnel. Diagnostic Information (optional) # Identify and note fail points and excessive waits. # Manipulate divergence and complexity. Traditionally, service blueprints have been depicted with lines and text boxes to depict anything from user actions to support processes. Fail points, bottlenecks and average time taken for each step can also be added at the analyst's discretion. The amount of information included in the service blueprint largely depends on how it is to be used. Over the years, a system of commonly accepted symbols associated with service blueprints has been developed. Although blueprints are not difficult to prepare, there is no universal agreement about how to present the finished process map. Interpretation When interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence. Complexity refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. A complex service process is one that has many steps. Divergence refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. The number of call-out signs attached to steps is an indicator of a service process that allows wide latitude to vary steps in the service delivery process. A self-service cafeteria accommodates volume operations by reducing divergence. Patrons must select from a range of pre- prepared dishes and opportunities for customisation are minimal or non- existent Manipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:Shostack, G.L., \\"How to Design a Service,\\" in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds), Marketing of Services, [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29 : Reduced Complexity: Specialisation strategy : Reduced Divergence: Volume-operations : Increase Complexity: Product development : Increased Divergence: Niche market strategy  Managerial actions for service design or structural change Fine dining operations typically allow for increased divergence. Patrons can request special dishes, cooked to order, special ingredients or accompaniments The examination of service blueprints 'may suggest opportunities for product improvement that might be achieved by reconfiguring delivery systems, adding or deleting specific elements, or repositioning the service to appeal to other segments'.Lovelock, C.H. and Wirtz, J., Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy, 5th ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ., Prentice Hall, 2004, p. 242 By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage service process improvements, service product improvements or new service innovations. Reduce divergence: Reducing divergence typically requires substituting equipment for labour, involving customers in self-service and introducing standardised operating procedures. The outcome is uniformity which reduces costs and improves productivity. This approach usually involves a shift to high-volume/low margin positioning and requires access to mass markets to be successful. The vulnerability of this approach is that it reduces customisation and flexibility. Increase divergence: Increasing divergence results is effectively a niche market strategy. Higher levels of customisation and flexibility require significant investments in human resources, recruitment and training all of which adds to costs. The approach usually involves a shift towards the prestige market segment and requires access to customers who are willing to pay a premium for customised services. The vulnerability of increased divergence is that processes are more difficult to manage, control and distribute. Reduce complexity: Reduced complexity usually involves a specialisation strategy. As steps are removed from the process, the service firm concentrates on a narrower range of offerings. Examples include an obstetrician, radiologist. The advantage of this approach is that the service provider can develop high levels of expertise and that distribution and control are facilitated. The vulnerability of this approach is that it exposes the service firm to risk, especially if competitors continue to offer the convenience of full-service alternatives. Increase complexity: Increased complexity is the service-product development option (i.e. sell different products to existing markets). Under this option, the service firm has an increased opportunity to maximise the revenue generated from each customer. The vulnerability inherent in this approach is that the firm's market positioning may become confused. Managing a broader array of products may also expose the firm to risks of spreading its effort too thin to the detriment of overall service quality.  Managerial actions for improvements to operational efficiency While blueprints draw attention to operational deficiencies, the blueprint, per se, cannot suggest solutions. In order to identify potential solutions to operating problems, the analyst must examine the service process and consider the factors that are likely to cause the problem. In addition, the range of possible solutions may be constrained by organisation's mission, current market position and access to resources. A very substantial body of marketing literature has addressed the question of possible solutions to problems identified through blueprinting. It is difficult to do justice to the wealth of studies using blueprints to gain managerial insights. A short summary of key managerial actions follows: Most fast food outlets use clearly articulated systems to process customers seamlessly. The blueprint is designed to support volume operations while allowing customers some flexibility to customise the offering Standardize Procedures Variable performance in service delivery is largely attributable to inseparability and human factors. Even in the back office, lack of standardisation can indirectly influence the customer process. In many organisations employees chose their own systems for storing files. Swank (2003: 125) cites an example of an insurance company where some employees filed according to policyholder (alphabetical), others by policy number (chronological) while others by date received. When employees were absent, substitutes sometimes found it hard to figure out where files were stored, so the process of retrieving files was delayed.Wener, R.E., \\"The Environmental Psychology of Service Encounters,\\" in Czepiel, J.A., Solomon, M.R. and Suprenant, C.F. (eds), The Service Encounter: Managing Customer Interactions in Service Businesses, Lexington Books, 1985 To reduce this variation, the service firm has several options. ::Production-lining – The production-line approach utilises a combination of hard and soft technologies to facilitate production, standardise procedures and minimise deviations arising from human error. This approach is typically characterised by simplification of tasks, clear division of labour and low levels of employee latitude.Van Looy, B., Gemmel, P. and Van Dierdonck, R., Services Management: An Integrated Approach, 2nd ed., Esse, UK, Prentice Hall, p.231 :: Introduce Standard Operating Procedures – In services where it is neither possible nor desirable to replace human labour with equipment, standardization may be achieved through soft technologies alone. Standards may include specifying the scripts for a technically correct performance, prescribing a uniform or dress code for employees, codifying operating procedures. Wherever possible, standards should include measurable components. :: Isolate the technical core – Deviations can also be reduced by decoupling the technical core from other aspects of the service system. For example, a theatre may elect to use a ticketing agent for all reservations and do away with the box-office. This approach may need to be accompanied by customer education programs to ensure seamless implementation. Standardization is clearly designed to provide tighter control over service delivery with a view to improving consistency of quality and making it easier for management to assess processes. Other benefits include reductions in costs and improved productivity. However, gains in operational efficiency achieved through standardization usually involve sacrificing flexibility and customisation. For the analyst, there is a constant trade off between improved operational efficiency and customised delivery. Identify and Manage Critical Incidents Some deviation is a normal aspect of service interactions; however any deviation that is likely to affect the customer's perceptions of value directly impacts on satisfaction. Those incidents which have the potential to become especially satisfying or dissatisfying are known as critical incidents and may benefit from standardised procedures.Bitner, M.J., \\"Evaluating Service Encounters: The Effects of Physical Surroundings and Employee Responses,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 54, no. 2, 1990, pp 69-82 Customer waiting time is often considered to be a critical incident and may also need to have standards and tolerances developed. Self-service technologies replace labour with equipment and deliver a standardised service efficiently Reduce the Number of Contact Points It is often suggested that a reduction in the number of contact points in the service processes can lead to greater efficiency since it reduces the total number of points where failure can creep into the system.Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M. \\"Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently,\\" Journal of Business Research, vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, p. 395 To simplify the delivery process, the most common way is to delegate activities to the customer through self-service technologies or self-guided processes. However, replacing technologies for humans contributes to inflexibility of service processes and may ultimately lead to fewer opportunities to differentiate a service offering in the marketplace. Planners may need to balance competing interests of controlling the process with the overall positioning strategy. Increase customer participation Customer participation should not be confused with customer contact. Customer participation is the degree of effort and involvement, both mental and physical, required to produce and deliver the service.Bove, L., 'Service Delivery: The Role of Personnel and Customers', in McColl-Kennedy, J., (ed.) Services Marketing: A Managerial Approach, Milton, Qld, Wiley, pp. 296–329. Examples of services high in customer participation include do-it-yourself car washes, salad bars and buffets, and distance (off-campus) education services. The level of customer participation varies from providing simple information to the service provider, to joint-production with the assistance of service staff, to instances where the customer is the sole producer (i.e. self- service). Customer participation focuses on reducing the costs associated with delivering the service product.Lovelock,, C. and Young, R.F., \\"Look to Customers to Increase Productivity,\\" Harvard Business Review, in Bateson, J., Managing Services Marketing: Text and Readings, Dryden, 1992 pp 178-188 For example, it costs approximately $3 for a bank to serve a customer over-the- counter as opposed to 1c via the Internet. Although the additional 'work' customers have to perform may be associated with such benefits as extended service hours, time-savings and in some instances monetary savings, these benefits may not be immediately obvious—they must be promoted. Segregate Complexity Anyone who has stood in line at a bank while a single teller assisted a customer with a lengthy transaction understands this principle. One solution is to cluster tasks with similar levels of difficulty into separate groups with their own procedures and performance. For example, a bank branches with large numbers of retail customers (with relatively simple transactions) and commercial customers (making large deposits and withdrawals) might want to introduce separate teller windows for each group of customers. Place Linked Processes in Close Physical Proximity Complex services involve many steps and may require paperwork or customer files to be shuffled between contact staff, back office and support departments. The time taken to move paperwork or customers is very costly in terms of time and efficiency. Tertiary student enrolment provides a great example of complex processes that are often not very customer-friendly. Students must firstly see an academic advisor to ensure that their course progress in on track, then see an administrative advisor to check that paperwork is in order and finally see a cashier to pay tuition fees and pay any fines, such as overdue library books before they can finalise their enrolment. In many institutions, this enrolment process can take half a day – and requires students to run from pillar to post as they complete each step. Locating each stage in close proximity has many advantages. Not only does it improve operational efficiency, it has the potential to allow service staff to focus on the total process and gain a better understanding of the ways that their actions impact on other parts of the system. In short, it forces employees to focus not just on the activities for which they are directly responsible. Eliminate Loop-Backs In manufacturing, a loopback occurs when work is returned to a previous step for further processing. Loop-backs typically create delays because they cause consequential problems along the production line. Given that service processes involve humans, rather than machines, processing may be complicated by employees' choices concerning which tasks to undertake and how to schedule them. If loop-backs present a problem, management can assist employees to clarify roles and tasks by focusing on their place within the overall service process. When systems have been poorly designed, lengthy queues or overcrowding may result. Control Fail Points Failures in service process may be attributed to either the service provider or the customer. It is possible that the service provider did not utilise resources in a way that best serves the customers needs. Alternatively, service provider failures may be caused by mismanagement. For example, an employee, who chooses to deviate from the script, may fail to serve the customer correctly. Finally, failures can be caused by customers who do not understand the process and do not know what they should be doing. For example, a customer might fail to provide appropriate documents to an appointment with a bank manager or lawyer.Fließ, S. & Kleinaltenkamp, M., \\"Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently,\\" Journal of Business Research, vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, p. 398 It is important to spend time diagnosing the reasons for fail points before implementing solutions. Failures attributable to customers are often due to misinformation. In such cases, the service firm could, for instance, provide customers with information checklists at the time when they make an appointment. Failures due to lack of resources may require short-term solutions to alleviate the immediate problem while long-term solutions including resource acquisition can be pursued.

History John T. and Anna Bredow were both born in Schleswig-Holstein in 1825. Their eldest son, John F., was born there in 1853. The family immigrated to Kiel, Wisconsin about the same time. Their sons Frank and Gerhard were born in Wisconsin. In 1870 the family moved to Davenport, where John T. operated a tavern. He built the family home on Gaines Street around 1876. His son John F. married Bertha Krieger in 1883 they had a daughter, Rhoda, who was born the following year. The three lived with John T. and Anna in the house on Gaines Street. The other sons had moved elsewhere. John F. worked for the German Savings Bank for 25 years. He became president of Iowa Mantle Manufacturing Co. and then president of Hydraulic Concrete Construction Co. The elder Bredow died around 1896, and John F. and his family continued to live in the house until 1920 when they moved to West Fourth Street. At some point, after they moved the house, it was divided into apartments. By 2005 the house had been vacant for 20 years; it was boarded up, part of its roof was missing and it was slated for demolition by the city.

The name derives from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate over the course of the reaction, and thus selection of a single product is equivalent to selection of one direction of rotation (i.e. the direction of torque on the substituents). The concept was originally developed by Kendall N. Houk. For ring closing reactions, it is an example of enantioselectivity, wherein a single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material. In a typical electrocyclic ring closing, selection for either conrotatory or disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers. Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction. Conrotatory and disrotatory modes of rotation each showing two possible directions of rotation that result in pairs of enantiomers for a generic hexatriene system. Note: in the case shown, there is no reason for the reaction to be torquoselective and both products would be expected for any particular set of conditions. Torquoselectivity is also used to describe selective electrocyclic ring openings, in which different directions of rotation produce distinct structural isomers. In these cases, steric strain is often the driving force for the selectivity. Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. Thermal electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene giving selectivity via steric strain Other mechanisms by which torquoselectivity can operate include chiral Lewis acid catalysts, induction via neighboring stereocenters (in which case the torquoselectivity is a case of diastereoselectivity), and axial-to- tetrahedral chirality transfer. An example of the latter case is shown below for the torquoselective Nazarov cyclization reaction of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone.

Gameplay Gameplay was team-based with players choosing to fight on behalf of the Autobots or Decepticons. The game offered both PVP and PVE gameplay, with the emphasis placed on PVP combat between the two factions in 4v4 matches. ;PVP Missions On loading into the game players were automatically placed in to a PVP queue where they could be assigned one of 2 different game modes, across 5 different maps. ;Elimination This game mode operated along traditional team-death match rules, players were placed into the game in two teams of four. The winner was determined by the first team to secure 20 kills. ;Meteor Storm This game mode shared common threads with \\"king-of-the-hill\\" game modes. Players operated in two teams of four, who needed to secure and hold meteor crash sites that appeared across the map. These points were captured by standing on the crash zone and waiting for the capture sequence to complete, taking damage during these capture moments would result in slowed acquisition of the site. During the course of gameplay the crash sites disappeared and respawned at different locations. The winner was the first team to score 1000 points. ;PVE Missions There were two type of PVE missions offered by the game, the first was open world missions that players encountered once they have left their respective home bases, and the other was a player invoked encounter. ;Open World Missions These took place in the zone immediately outside of the base, it was an open world in which players could engage in dynamically generated missions and events that spawned at numerous locations throughout the open world. Players could choose to take on these missions alone or in conjunction with other players around the environment. ;Energon Quests A four player mission that would pit players against increasingly difficult AI enemies as they progressed through a series of objectives before taking on a final boss. The core game objective was to gather and collect energy that was used throughout the game for Transformer repair and crafting. =Classes= Players utilised a squad of different Transformers, on starting the game players had 3 different Transformers to pick from, further Transformers could be unlocked through playing the game but could also be purchased using the in-game currency Relics. Whilst all the Transformers seemed to differ, there was three core character types. Healers were characters who were equipped with healing ‘weaponry’ and associated healing equipment.

It incorporates a medieval farm complex, with a main old barn dating from the 13th century and a farm house from the 16th. Nearby are the remains of a motte-and-bailey castle believed to date from shortly after the Norman conquest of England. Original groundwork on the site has been dated to the 9th century. Ownership of the site passed to the King's College, Cambridge in the 15th century. The Great Barn and Little Barn were recognised by a member of the Royal Society of Arts in 1930 as in need of conservation, and in 1931 Manor Farm was included in the sale of Park Wood as a gift to the people of Ruislip. The site continued as a working farm until 1933, and is now run as a community resource by the London Borough of Hillingdon. Throughout 2007 and 2008, the site was restored with funding from the National Lottery, and has become a heritage area for the London Borough of Hillingdon. Manor Farm is within the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. Events are regularly held within the 13th-century Great Barn and around the rest of the site. History =Origins= The remains of the motte-and-bailey castle What remains of the motte-and-bailey castle can be seen today in part of the moat and bank on the site. Today, the moat on the site is a scheduled monument, believed to have been extended to create an oval area upon which a wooden castle covering by was built, presumably for the landowner, Ernulf de Hesdin. He was given control of the manor of Ruislip shortly after the Norman conquest, in recognition of his loyalty to William the Conqueror. The castle is believed to have been built between 1066 and 1087, but does not appear in the 1086 Domesday Book and so could have been demolished or changed significantly. It may never have been finished. Ruislip parish was owned by the Benedictine Bec Abbey of Normandy between 1096 and 1404 during which time the prior built a home for himself on the site, surrounded by a moat. During the 16th century, the remains of the motte-and- bailey site were used as the gardens of the Manor Farm House when it was built. In 1888 the moat extension was filled in by Henry James Ewer, who farmed on the site. The moat's shape and the presence of traces of a fortified building have allowed this part of the site to be dated to the 11th century. However, the castle is believed to have been built around 1066 then either demolished or changed significantly as it does not appear as a castle in Domesday Book.Bowlt 1994, p.12 The farm buildings date back to the 13th century with the Great Barn the most prominent. The barn is the second largest such structure in Middlesex after another in Harmondsworth.Bowlt 1994, p.14 The Great Barn is constructed of English oak from the nearby Ruislip Woods. It was built to a design known as an aisled barn, whereby smaller out-shoots run alongside the main supports underneath one main roof. =Ownership= The Manor Farm House was built in the 16th century Great Barn interior Studies by English Heritage have found that the site originally functioned not only as the manorial court hall for Ruislip, but also as a working farm. The main building was built over two existing structures, possibly to accommodate the new lessee of the manor, Robert Drury, a former Speaker of the House of Commons. The study concluded this was most likely achieved by a team of masons and carpenters. Manor Farm was also known as Ruislip Court until the 19th century.Bowlt 1994, p.16 In 1451, ownership of the farm passed with the rest of Ruislip to King's College, Cambridge who remain titular Lords of the Manor. King's completed two surveys of the manor during their ownership, in 1565 and 1750. The Farm House was built from locally produced bricks, tiles and timber in the 16th century, and served as the manorial court until 1925 when the last court was held. Work in the 18th and 19th centuries saw the windows and doorways replaced, while an extended kitchen was installed. The kitchen extension was replaced in 1958 as part of a general refurbishment of the house. Manor Farm and Park Wood were nearly demolished in the early 1900s to make way for a new development planned in partnership with King's College and the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. A town planning competition was won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who suggested a symmetrical design across the parish which would have seen a total of 7,642 new homes built.Bowlt 1994, p.96 St. Martin's Church would have been the only example of historical architecture left in Ruislip. An outline map of the new development proposal was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A Local Board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914. Three roads with residential housing, Manor Way, Windmill Way and Park Way were completed before the outbreak of the First World War when all construction work was halted. It was not resumed until 1919, though the plan was substantially scaled back as work slowed throughout the next decade.Bowlt 1994, p.100 Manor Farm Library opened in 1937 The protection of Manor Farm and the local woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit by a member of the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931. Park Wood was sold for £28,100 with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip.Bowlt 2007, p.35 King's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new buildings were constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.Bowlt 1994, p.115 In 1932, the two cart sheds on either side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker purchased a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued as a working farm until the following year, when the local council began to sell off much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use. The council obliged and the Winston Churchill Hall was built in 1965.Bowlt 1994, p.119 A smaller barn built in the 16th century, the Little Barn, was converted to a library and opened on 2 November 1937. The original cowbyre was destroyed by fire in 1979 and was rebuilt as an exhibition centre. An archaeological excavation was carried out by the Museum of London Archaeological Service in 1997 around the Farm House. This discovered the remains of the old priory were beneath the house, as this had been the bailey, surrounded by the motte. =Restoration= The site was refurbished with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund in April 2007 with the work completed in June the following year. This included the renovation of the Grade II listed Manor Farm library as part of a borough-wide programme by the London Borough of Hillingdon. The Duck Pond Market began in the Great Barn in December 2008, following the refurbishment, and runs twice a month. Winston Churchill Theatre, not included in the original restoration work, received a £370,000 grant from Hillingdon Council in March 2011 to enable its refurbishment. The other buildings on the site are used as an Exhibition venue (the Cow Byre Gallery), community spaces (The Stables and the Manor Farm Community Hut) and as a small interpretation centre and base of the Hillingdon Music Service (Manor Farm House). Since 6 September 1974, all the buildings on the site are Grade II listed, except for the Great Barn, which is Grade II*. =Comparable structures= Other moated medieval farm complexes survive in the nearby area at Headstone Manor and (without a surviving moat) at Pinner Park. Traces of a moat survived at Harmondsworth Great Barn until 1968. References ;Citations ;Bibliography * Bowlt, Eileen. M. (1994) Ruislip Past. London: Historical Publications * Bowlt, Eileen. M.

The episode was written by show runner Steven Moffat and directed by Toby Haynes. It was first broadcast on 23 April 2011 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, the United States on BBC America and in Canada on Space. It also aired in Australia on ABC1 on 30 April 2011. The episode features alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), and is the first of a two-part story, which concluded with \\"Day of the Moon\\" on 30 April. In the episode, the Doctor, Amy, Rory and the archaeologist River Song (Alex Kingston) are summoned together by a version of the Doctor from 200 years in his future. Trying to understand the enigmatic hints about \\"Space 1969\\" the older Doctor mentioned and a man they meet in 2011 called Canton Evrett Delaware III (Mark Sheppard and William Morgan Sheppard), they travel to the United States in 1969 and discover a scared girl (Sydney Wade) who is trapped inside a spacesuit. The team deals with the Silence, a religious order of aliens which has members who can make people forget their encounter with them when they look away. The Silence was created to compete with other past aliens in terms of \\"scariness,\\" including the Weeping Angels. The episode was partially filmed on location at Lone Rock, Utah, the first time in Doctor Who that principal photography took place in the United States. The episode was seen by 8.86 million viewers in the United Kingdom, and received generally positive reviews from critics. \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" gained an Appreciation Index of 88 - considered excellent. The episode was dedicated to Elisabeth Sladen, known for playing former companion Sarah Jane Smith, who died from cancer on 19 April 2011. Plot =Prequel= On 22 March 2011, a short scene serving as a prequel for the first episode was released on the programme's website. In the prequel, Richard Nixon receives a phone call from the little girl who keeps calling him in the episode. She begs for the President to look behind him, but he asks how she got that number, which the \\"spaceman\\" told her. She tells him it is about monsters, to which he replies \\"Young lady, there are no monsters in the Oval Office.\\" He then hangs up and leans back. Behind him stands an out-of-focus member of the Silence. =Synopsis= Buzz Aldrin during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. A replica of this suit was created for the episode. During a break from their travels with the Eleventh Doctor, his companions Amy and Rory are sent envelopes summoning them to Utah at a specific time and location. They arrive to meet River Song (who also received an envelope) and the Doctor, who is nearly 200 years older than he was when he last saw Amy and Rory. He offers them a picnic, and then a trip to \\"space 1969\\". During the picnic, a figure from the lake in an American astronaut suit shoots the Doctor multiple times and his body falls. A man with a can of gasoline called Canton Everett Delaware III arrives, telling Amy, Rory, and River that the dead man is the real Doctor. The Doctor's body is burned in a Viking funeral. Amy, Rory, and River talk at a diner when they discover the fourth envelope was sent to the Doctor, alive and 200 years younger than the one at the lake. The Doctor's companions tell him about space 1969 and Canton, but refuse to tell him about his death or that the sender is the Doctor himself. The Doctor and his companions travel back to 8 April 1969, where the younger Canton, a former FBI operative, is briefed by President Richard Nixon about a series of phone calls Nixon received from a young girl asking for help. The Doctor arrives in Washington, DC and convinces Nixon to give him a few minutes to locate the girl. Based on the phone call and the girl's mention of a \\"spaceman\\", he tracks down the Florida intersection where the girl is located. Meanwhile, Amy meets and takes a photograph of one of the leaders of the Silence, a group she also saw by the lake which people forget about any time someone stops looking at them. Canton follows the Doctor and the others into the TARDIS as they depart for Florida. Upon arrival at the building where the girl is held, they find pieces of a space suit and alien technology. River and Rory explore a vast network of tunnels that have apparently spread across the planet for centuries, unnoticed by the human population and populated by the Silence. Finding Canton unconscious near a figure in a space suit, Amy picks up Canton's gun and shoots at the suit. However, she realises too late that the helmet's visor has opened to reveal the little girl. =Continuity= The TARDIS had been previously turned invisible by damage to its visual stabiliser in the Second Doctor story The Invasion (1968). When Canton first leaves the TARDIS, the Doctor remarks, \\"Brave heart, Canton,\\" a reference to the Fifth Doctor's recurrent statement to his companion Tegan Jovanka, \\"Brave heart, Tegan.\\" When Amy asks the younger Doctor to trust her, he asks her to swear to him on something that matters. After some thought, she smiles and says \\"Fish fingers and custard,\\" referring to events in \\"The Eleventh Hour,\\" when Amy first meets the Doctor as a little girl. Production =Writing= Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat (pictured) created the Silence to compete with other creatures in the past in terms of \\"scariness.\\" The episode was written by Steven Moffat, who took charge of the show in 2010. Moffat wanted the 2011 season to start with a two-part story in an attempt to begin with more gravity and a wider scope in plot, as well as wanting the episodes to be one of the darker ones in the series. \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" / \\"Day of the Moon\\" was the first two-part episode to open a series since the 1985 Sixth Doctor story Attack of the Cybermen. In the Doctor Who Confidential episode following the broadcast of \\"The Impossible Astronaut,\\" Moffat stated that in his view, it was one of the darker episodes of the series, but still maintained the same level of humour. The inclusion of the Doctor's death felt like a series ender for some of the producers, but was actually there to \\"kick it off.\\" In writing the death scene of the older version of the Doctor, Moffat wanted to acknowledge to the audience that Time Lords are not invincible, and could still die permanently if killed before regeneration. In creating the Silence, the alien antagonists of the episode, Moffat wanted them to challenge past monsters in terms of \\"scariness.\\" He felt these creatures are a \\"much bigger deal.\\" The aliens' design was partially inspired by the figure from the Edvard Munch painting The Scream. =Casting= In October 2010, it was announced that Mark Sheppard, who had appeared in other past science fiction series, including Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, Supernatural, and Warehouse 13, would make a guest appearance on Doctor Who. Sheppard described playing Canton as a \\"dream job,\\" and said he wished to appear in another of Moffat's works, including Sherlock. Even though Sheppard is an English actor, it was his first appearance in a British-made television show. For the scene depicting the older Canton Delaware, the producers originally planned that Sheppard would appear older using makeup effects. However, Sheppard suggested instead that his father and actor, William Morgan Sheppard, play the role, a suggestion that was accepted. American actor Stuart Milligan was cast as President Nixon, which he said he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland as the voice of Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke. =Filming and effects= Karen Gillan (centre) was reportedly genuinely upset filming the death scene of the older version of the Doctor. Matt Smith at filming in Utah. This pair of episodes marks the first time that Doctor Who has filmed principal photography footage within the United States; the American-produced TV movie of 1996 was filmed in Canada, and some second unit establishing shots of New York and the Statue of Liberty were filmed on Liberty Island for the episode \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\", but none of the cast of the episode were involved in the shoot. Filming took place in the state of Utah. For the opening shot for the location, director Toby Haynes wanted it to be epic so that the audience could recognise where the episode was set. Scenes on the roadway were filmed on U.S. Route 163 (several miles east of the coordinates listed on the Doctor's invitations). The crew wanted to add as many American icons as they could into those shots, including a Stetson hat, a 1950s Edsel Villager, and a yellow school bus. Moffat, having enjoyed writing episodes featuring River Song, wanted to give her an impressive entrance. Haynes had actress Alex Kingston block the sunlight from the camera angle and blow smoke from her revolver. The scenes involving the picnic and the future-Doctor dying took place on the shore of Lake Powell. The suit worn by the future-Doctor's killer was a fabricated replica of an Apollo space suit. In filming the death scene the filming crew noticed that Karen Gillan was genuinely upset and \\"was acting her heart out.\\" In filming the \\"Viking funeral\\" scene, Haynes wished to film it during the sunset. However, the sun set over the desert, so was instead filmed during sunrise, as the sun rose over the water. Kingston had to genuinely slap Matt Smith several times in a scene because it was difficult to fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen. Broadcast and reception =Pre-broadcast leak= At some point before the broadcast of the episode, it and \\"Day of the Moon\\" were released in a press screening, where a number of fans were invited to attend. The production team present asked them not to give away any spoilers. However, following the screening a fan gave away the entire plot of the two episodes on an internet forum. News of this angered Moffat. In an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, Moffat stated; Despite this he added that the majority of Doctor Who fans are \\"spoiler-phobes,\\" who refused to go online to be spoiled. =Broadcast and ratings= The episode begins with a still-caption tribute to former Doctor Who actress Elisabeth Sladen (pictured) following her death from cancer. \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" was first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2011 at 6 pm. It began with a still-caption tribute to actress Elisabeth Sladen, who died from cancer on 19 April 2011. Sladen had previously appeared in the series as companion Sarah Jane Smith, and as the same character on the spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures. After the broadcast \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" received preliminary, overnight figures of 6.52 million viewers. Final consolidated ratings for the episode increased to 8.86 million, with a 43.2 per cent audience share. This made the episode the second highest rated programme of the day, behind Britain's Got Talent on ITV1. The episode was the third most watched on BBC One, and sixth overall for the entire week ending 24 April. An additional 300,000 viewed the episode from BBC iPlayer within two days of its original broadcast. It received an Appreciation Index of 88, one of the higher scores for the weekend. In the United States the episode aired on BBC America on the same day it was released in the United Kingdom, as was the case in Canada for Space. 1.3 million viewers saw \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" on BBC America, making it the highest rated telecast in the history of the channel. It was reportedly up by 71,000 from \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". When Live + 7 day DVR ratings were added, the total rose to 1.8 million. In Canada, the episode was seen by 538,000, making it the most watched Who episode for the channel, and its most watched telecast in 2011. It was shown on ABC1 in Australia on 30 April 2011, and was viewed by 860,000 from the five capital cities, matching the ratings from \\"A Christmas Carol\\" on Boxing Day 2010. Audience measurement service Kantar Media reported that \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" is the most recorded television event of all time. Analysis of BARB data revealed that 4.11 million people recorded and viewed the programme within a week of broadcast, accounting for 46% of the episode's total viewers. A total of 1.38 million requests were placed on iPlayer for the month of April, placing it at number one for the month. =Critical reception= The episode was met with generally positive reviews from television critics. Dan Martin of The Guardian reacted positively towards the episode, believing the cast performed better than the previous fifth series. He stated \\"Steven Moffat has thrown away the rule book and made Doctor Who as, you imagine, he's pictured it should be his whole life. Killing the Doctor leaves the shape of the series mapped out, raises the bar so that no one is safe, and sees Amy, Rory and River facing a terrible dilemma.\\" Martin liked that \\"Amy's numbed horror ramps things up to a series-finale level on intensity from the off,\\" and then switches \\"into an Oval Office comedy of manners,\\" and \\"morphs into gothic horror and finally flings you to the ground with its cinematic cliffhanger.\\" He was also positive towards the American setting, and \\"our eccentric British foursome bumbling through it,\\" believing the series raised its game with this. With regards to the Silence, Martin believed it was \\"a standard Moffat psychological trick, but the most refined to date.\\" Martin later rated it the second best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Silence creatures as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy called the episode \\"a fantastic launch for the sixth series,\\" adding \\"the Doctor Who team's US location shooting has certainly paid off, lending these early scenes a grand scale that the series could scarcely have expected to achieve in 2005, let alone in 1963.\\" Commenting on the future-Doctor's death, Jeffery said \\"seven minutes in, a nation's collective jaw dropped as The Doctor — this show's lead — is mercilessly gunned down. This plot twist is simply stunning, and it's difficult to imagine even casual viewers not sitting up to pay attention at this point.\\" Jeffery also believed that the series regulars were on \\"top form,\\" adding \\"the more abrasive aspects of Amy Pond's personality seem to have been toned down this year, and Karen Gillan responds with her best, most sympathetic performance to date. Arthur Darvill also lives up to his recent promotion to full-time companion. His comic timing is simply superb, but he excels too in the episode's darker moments.\\" Jeffery rated the episode five stars out of five. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph believed it was \\"a cracking start to the first part of the 2011 series, with the shocking ending of Amy seemingly shooting a girl making one keen wait for the conclusion next week to see how it all resolves itself,\\" as well as enjoying the concept of the Silence. Rick Marshall of MTV believed that \\"Steven Moffat and the Doctor Who crew offer up yet another great episode,\\" but also said the \\"big cliffhanger will likely cause more than a few fans' heads to explode.\\" In addition, Marshall believed the alien antagonists \\"give the Weeping Angels a run for their money in scare factor.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the episode was \\"a triumphant return for Doctor Who, bubbling with confidence and throwing down story strands that hint at an engrossing series.\\" Brew liked Sheppard's performance as Delaware and Darvill's increasing presence as Rory. Brew also complimented Haynes' work in the United States, saying it was an improvement from \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\", which featured British actors attempting to play with American accents. Tom Phillips of Metro said the 1969 US setting were \\"beautifully used,\\" and enjoyed the \\"spookiness\\" of the Silence. However Phillips felt the episode would be \\"a bit hard to get into\\" for new viewers. Kevin O'Sullivan of The Sunday Mirror was more negative towards the episode, stating it was \\"impossible to understand,\\" and for \\"strictly sci-fi nerds only,\\" adding that Smith \\"remains a derivative Doctor who brings nothing new to the party.\\" References External links 2011 British television episodes Eleventh Doctor episodes Television episodes written by Steven Moffat Cultural depictions of Richard Nixon Fiction set in 1969 Fiction set in 2011 Doctor Who pseudohistorical serials Doctor Who stories set on Earth Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Since 1997, all full-power and Class A low-power television stations have been required to broadcast at least three hours (or more if they operate digital subchannels) per-week of programs that are specifically designed to meet the educational and informative (E/I) needs of children aged 16 and younger. There are also regulations on advertising in broadcast and cable television programming targeting children 12 and younger, including limits on ad time, and prohibitions on advertising of products related to the program currently airing. Early regulations on educational programming were implemented by the FCC in 1991, as ordered by the Children's Television Act—an Act of Congress passed in 1990. They included a requirement for television stations to document their broadcasting of programs which \\"[further] the positive development of children 16 years of age and under in any respect, including the child's intellectual/cognitive or social/emotional needs\\", and a requirement for the FCC to use this as a factor in license renewals. Stricter regulations were implemented in 1997, requiring all stations to broadcast at least 3 hours of programming per-week that is designed to educate and inform viewers aged 16 and younger, and introducing requirements regarding on-air identification of these programs, and more stringent reporting requirements. The E/I regulations had a major impact on U.S. television; the syndication market was bolstered by demand for compliant educational programming, while the Saturday morning cartoon blocks traditionally aired by major networks began to increase their focus on educational programming. This factor, however, alongside the growth of cable channels (such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon) and other platforms serving youth demographics (which were not subject to the rules), contributed to an overall decline in broadcast television airings of non-educational children's programming. The educational programming regulations have faced mixed reception. There have historically been concerns over whether these mandates constitute a violation of broadcasters' rights to free speech. The FCC's initial regulations faced criticism for being too broad in its definition of children's educational programming, with stations attempting to classify various non-educational programs as containing educational elements. In the years following the CTA's implementation, the Annenberg Foundation observed that the amount of \\"highly educational\\" programming on television had dropped, citing its allowance of programming discussing social issues to be counted, as opposed to programming dealing in traditional academic fields. The regulations have been described by current FCC commissioner Michael O'Rielly as \\"onerous\\" and outdated due to the cable and new media platforms that have emerged since their introduction, which led to changes in 2019 to provide more flexibility in compliance.  Background  Concern over the impact that television had on children began when television was still a new entertainment medium. During the 1950s, many individuals, particularly parents, asked their legislators to do something about the potential effects of television viewing on young people. Academic research was initiated since this time to monitor, analyze and explain the relationships between television and children, although the impact of television on academic performance continues to be debated in scholarly research. The first attempt to address these concerns were during Congressional hearings in 1952 that addressed violence. Besides Congress, there were government commissions that also pursued this agenda. Included in these discussions were the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission, and advocacy groups formed by concerned citizens. The FCC intended to change a number of policies regarding children's programming. Research demonstrated that young children had difficulty distinguishing between the program they were watching, and commercials broadcast during them. Most children had little or no understanding of the persuasive intent of commercials, and as such, were highly vulnerable to claims and appeals by advertisers. Advertisers, especially those related to junk food, were interested in youth as consumers because of their spending power through their parents, their influence, and their brand awareness as adult consumers in the future.  History  The lobbying group Action for Children's Television (ACT), which was founded by activist Peggy Charren, actively campaigned for higher-quality children's programming to be broadcast by television stations. The group was critical of the lack of educational programming on television—believing that it was part of broadcasters' obligations to serve the public interest, and accusing cartoons such as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and My Little Pony of being merely a promotional tie-in for associated toylines rather than legitimate entertainment. The cancellations of ABC's Animals, Animals, Animals and CBS's children's newsmagazine 30 Minutes, were cited by ACT as examples of the major networks' decreasing commitment to educational programming. In 1982, the Reagan administration's FCC chairman Mark S. Fowler lamented upon CBS's decision to move its long-running children's series Captain Kangaroo, from its historic weekday morning timeslot, to weekends, in order to accommodate an expanded morning newscast. CBS had already shortened the program from a full hour to 30 minutes in 1981 for the same reason. At the time, the big three networks scheduled the majority of their children's programming, including cartoons, during Saturday morning lineups, along with occasional late- afternoon \\"after school specials\\"—anthologies of made-for-TV movies focusing on issues affecting youth. Captain Kangaroo had to compete not only with news- based morning shows such as Good Morning America and Today (which CBS sought to compete with), but local and syndicated offerings also targeting children. Fowler was against mandating the broadcast of educational programming by commercial stations, arguing that it was within their First Amendment rights to choose the programming they wish to broadcast, and adding that \\"it's too bad Captain Kangaroo is gone, but the Government should not be issuing directives about what should be on the air.\\" Fowler suggested that, if the FCC felt there was not enough children's programming on television, it could mandate that commercial stations contribute funding to support the production of educational children's programming by public broadcasters. The idea was criticized by NBC's vice president as being a \\"tax\\" on commercial broadcasting, while ABC argued that commercial television (including networks and their affiliates) was doing a better job at serving children than public broadcasters. On the other hand, Captain Kangaroo creator and host Bob Keeshan disagreed, arguing that children were \\"just too important to be left to the networks and their profit motives.\\" Citing the recent New York v. Ferber decision, he told The New York Times that \\"despite the guarantee of free speech, our children are so precious that the free speech of the [child] pornographer had to give way to allow us to protect children from exploitation.\\" = Children's Television Act = No serious action took place until the 1990 enactment of the Children's Television Act (CTA), an Act of Congress which ordered the FCC to implement regulations surrounding programming that serves the \\"educational and informational\\" (E/I) needs of children, as well as the amount of advertising broadcast during television programs aimed towards children. This included that a station's commitment to airing and supporting educational children's programming had to become a factor in license renewals, and that limits had to be imposed on the amount of advertising that can be aired during television programs targeting children. The CTA also called for the Secretary of Education to establish a National Endowment to help support the production of educational children's programming. The FCC met its statutory obligations by introducing new regulations effective October 1, 1991. Television stations and cable providers would be required to maintain and publish summaries of the children's educational programming that they broadcast, defined as \\"programming that furthers the positive development of children 16 years of age and under in any respect, including the child's intellectual/cognitive or social/emotional needs\\". As ordered, commercial time during children's programming was limited to 12 minutes per half-hour on weekdays and 10.5 on weekends. Advertising during children's programs for products associated with the program currently airing (\\"program-length commercials\\"), or containing \\"program talent or other identifiable program characteristics\\" (host-selling), was also banned. The rule was intended to prevent children's programs that were tie-ins with toy franchises (such as, for example, G.I. Joe) from airing ads for the toys themselves during their associated programs. Broadcasters were also encouraged to establish a clear separation between program and advertising content on-air during children's programming, so that younger viewers are able to distinguish between them. The CTA was passed despite objections by the Bush administration, who believed that requiring the broadcast of educational programming by all television stations was a violation of their rights to free speech. The restriction on \\"program-length commercials\\" was also considered to be too narrow; critics (such as Charren) had demanded that it apply to any program targeted towards children that was primarily designed to promote products associated with them, rather than only applying if advertising for said products were broadcast during the program. The 1990 regulations were considered to be ineffective; many stations failed to keep the required records or had any method for accurate recording. More than 25% of television stations in the U.S. failed to record the time, date, or length of programming considered to be educational in content. The FCC did little to regulate these logs up until 1993, but later on, came up with certain rules and regulations such as the safe harbor provision in order to regulate content for younger audiences. Due to the weak definition used (and in particular, the allowance for programs meeting social and emotional needs to possibly be considered educational), many stations attempted to interpret programs not specifically- designed to be educational—such as The Flintstones, G.I. Joe, Hard Copy, The Jetsons, and Leave It to Beaver—as containing discussion of social and moral issues that made them \\"educational\\". = 1996 regulations = In 1995, FCC commissioner Reed Hundt began campaigning for stricter children's educational programming regulations, arguing that broadcasters were not displaying a sufficient commitment to the 1990 regulations. His proposal included that stations be required to air a minimum of three hours of children's educational programming per-week. Jeff Bingaman issued a letter of support for the proposal, signed by 24 Democratic senators and 1 Republican. Fox Kids president Margaret Loesch denied Hundt's arguments that broadcasters were not following the rules, stating that most Fox affiliates aired an average of four hours of children's educational programming per-week (which already exceeded the proposed minimum). Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, accused Hundt of being \\"obsessed\\" with the proposed quota. In regards to reports that Hundt was struggling to receive FCC majority support for the proposal and was repeatedly \\"stalling\\" a final vote, Fritts stated that Hundt was that \\"acting like a regulatory referee wanting to push the game into overtime even though the final score is lopsided.\\", and that he \\"made up his mind long ago that broadcasters were to be castigated on children’s TV, without reservation, and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\\" Following a push for support from Congress and the Clinton administration, the FCC adopted the Children's Programming Report and Order in August 1996. The new regulations were intended to provide clearer regulatory obligations for television stations, and promote public awareness of educational programming offered by television stations. The order and regulations defined \\"core educational programming\\" as regularly-scheduled programs, of at least 30 minutes in length, that are \\"specifically designed\\" to meet the educational and informative needs of children 16 years old and younger. The FCC ordered that by September 1997, all commercial television stations must broadcast at least three hours of core educational programming per-week, regularly scheduled between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Beginning January 2, 1997, television stations were required to use an \\"E/I\\" label to promote these programs on-air and in programming information supplied to TV listings providers. Commercial stations are also required to compile, publish, and publicize a quarterly Children's Television Programming Report in their public file, detailing the children's educational programming aired during the past quarter, what programs it plans to air during the next, and providing a point of contact for viewer inquiries about the educational programs aired by a station. As they are not under the jurisdiction of the FCC, this regulation does not apply to cable channels. While Non-commercial educational stations are also required to comply with the regulations, they are not subject to its monitoring and reporting rules. PBS member stations typically devote a large portion of their weekday, daytime lineup to children's educational programming under the PBS Kids brand. = 2006 changes = An example E/I \\"bug\\", which must be displayed on-screen during core educational programming. In September 2004, the FCC announced revisions to the regulations to account for the then- upcoming digital television transition. An additional half-hour of E/I programming must be broadcast for every increment of 28 hours of additional free video programming the station offers via digital subchannels. The regulations also stipulate that an \\"E/I\\" logo must be displayed on-screen throughout such a program, that a regularly-scheduled E/I program may only be rescheduled 10% of the time, and that if rescheduled or moved to a different multicast channel, the station must announce the new scheduling on-air. The FCC also introduced new rules regarding promotion of websites during children's programming aimed at viewers 12 and younger on broadcast and cable channels; they may only be for pages that do not contain any commercial or e-commerce content, must offer \\"a substantial amount of bona fide program- related or other noncommercial content\\", and that pages containing imagery of characters from the program must be \\"sufficiently separated\\" from commercial areas of the site. The implementation of the advertising rules were deferred from February 2005 to January 2006, following concerns by broadcasters over the amount of time given to become compliant. Disney, NBC Universal, and Viacom issued a joint filing to the FCC in September 2005 to urge against the \\"far-reaching, burdensome and expensive\\" advertising rules, with Disney also suing over the regulations as being a violation of freedom of speech. On December 16, 2005, the FCC chose to delay the new regulation to March 6, 2006, in order to allow time for further discussion. They were ultimately implemented in September. = 2019 changes = Current FCC commissioner Michael O'Rielly has considered the educational programming regulations to be outdated. Citing the wider variety of platforms available (including cable networks and digital platforms), he stated that \\"with today's dynamic media marketplace there are very little, if any, additional benefits provided by the Kid Vid rules\\". O'Rielly also argued that the \\"onerous\\" nature of the regulations were also making stations reluctant to air other, more viable programs on Saturday mornings, such as newscasts and sports. In July 2018, the FCC issued proposals regarding changes to the rules, including removing the requirement that a program must be regularly scheduled and at least 30 minutes in length, providing the option for all of a station's E/I programming to air on a subchannel rather than the main signal, allowing stations to organize or sponsor \\"non-broadcast\\" initiatives in lieu of airing educational programming, and replacing the quarterly report with an annual report. O'Rielly felt that the 30-minute minimum length \\"killed off shorter, high-quality programs that were once popular and educational\\", and does not reflect current viewing habits. A group in favor of maintaining the existing policies, which included the Benton Foundation, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and Common Sense Kids Action, among others, issued a letter of opposition to the FCC. They disagreed with O'Rielly's assessment that non-broadcast platforms \\"provide significant educational programming for children\\", and argued that broadcast television was still widely viewed by children, and that not all families have access to non-broadcast media. On June 19, 2019, the FCC issued its proposed rule changes: while the basic minimum will remain intact, the earliest time allowed for E/I programming will move up an hour earlier, to 6:00 a.m. local time (which, prior to the tightening of the rules, was a common start time for children's programming on many American television stations). Furthermore, a limited amount of public service announcements and short-form programming will be allowed to count as E/I, and stations will be allowed to schedule up to a third of the required programming on its digital subchannels. As a consequence of the latter aspect of the rule changes, the requirement to place E/I programming on every subchannel will be removed. Enforcement of the subchannel compliance with the E/I rules had resulted in incongruency of the required programming with the formats of many subchannels, particularly with the rise of niche multicast networks that rely on a specific genre of programming (e.g., classic television, movies, etc.) or focus on news, weather or sports (whether nationally distributed or locally originated) as few subchannel services target a general audience or children. The rules were officially approved on July 10, and went into effect on September 16.  Effects on programming  Following the implementation of the regulations, many television stations began to cut locally produced children's programs due to budgetary concerns, and largely replaced them with educational programs acquired from the syndication market. Studios such as Litton Entertainment have benefited from the resulting demand. The Annenberg Foundation found that the number of network television shows deemed to be \\"highly educational\\" from 1990 to 1998 fell from 43% to 29%. A research report from Georgetown University said that one issue contributing to this was that what constituted \\"educational television\\" programming was defined too broadly, as programming that was only academic or that covered pro-social issues, for example, counted towards station requirements. Another issue was that traditional ideas of what should be taught to children, such as the alphabet or number systems, were lost. There was also a reported increase in the number of programs focusing on social issues. Writers for these programs wrote stories that often were not academically sound for young viewers, because they were not trained in writing for this audience. One show that was an exception to this rule is The Magic School Bus, as it combined effective writing and educational content for children. Networks picked up series more often when they were related to a well-known pop culture icon, or could be marketable as toys. Owing to the success of PBS's Barney & Friends from both a critical and commercial standpoint, Disney and Nickelodeon saw a greater interest in making preschool programming that was more engaging and had educational value to its target audience. However, they also leveraged techniques designed to bolster the programs as a brand when merchandised, such as close-up \\"money shots\\" of key characters designed to encourage recognition of them by viewers. = Saturday morning blocks = In the wake of the stricter regulations, the big three television networks began to retool their Saturday morning lineups for the 1997-98 television season in order to include more educational programming. ABC, which had recently been acquired by Disney, introduced One Saturday Morning for the 1997–98 season. It featured a mix of Disney animated series, educational interstitial segments (including a history-oriented segment starring comedian Robin Williams, reprising his role as the Genie from Aladdin), the new educational series Science Court, and a flagship wraparound program (Disney's One Saturday Morning). ABC stated that four of the block's five hours would be branded as E/I programming. One Saturday Morning quickly became the top Saturday morning block in terms of viewership, until competition from Fox Kids and Kids' WB began to erode its audience. In 2002, the block was rebranded as ABC Kids, which drew from the programming of Disney's cable networks Disney Channel, ABC Family (which Disney had recently acquired from Fox), and Toon Disney; the block would be reduced to four hours in 2004 (with Power Rangers being the only non-compliant program on the block). CBS relaunched its Saturday morning block for the 1997–98 season as Think CBS Kids, with a focus on live-action educational series such as The New Ghostwriter Mysteries, The Weird Al Show, and Wheel 2000—a children's version of the game show Wheel of Fortune. CBS relaunched the block again the following season as the CBS Kidshow, with a focus on cartoons that were adapted from children's books, and produced by Canadian animation studio Nelvana. In 2000, following the network's acquisition by Viacom, CBS replaced Kidshow with a block programmed by its new corporate sister Nickelodeon; the block initially focused exclusively on preschool programming from the Nick Jr. brand, but from 2002 to 2004, the block targeted a broader youth audience. In 2006, after CBS and Viacom split back into separate companies, CBS partnered with DIC Entertainment to launch KOL Secret Slumber Party (in conjunction with AOL's children's vertical KOL). The block was re-branded as KEWLopolis the following season as part of a new sponsorship with American Greetings, and Cookie Jar TV in 2009 following the acquisition of DIC by Cookie Jar Group. NBC had removed cartoons from its Saturday morning lineup in 1992 in favor of TNBC, which featured live-action sitcoms aimed towards a teen audience. After declining ratings, TNBC was replaced in 2001 with Discovery Kids on NBC, which was programmed by the cable channel Discovery Kids and featured factual entertainment programming and educational cartoons (including the first animated programs aired by NBC's Saturday morning lineup since the TNBC era). In September 2006, it was replaced by Qubo, a joint venture with Ion Media Networks, Nelvana owner Corus Entertainment, Scholastic and Classic Media that was focused on educational programming. Following Comcast's purchase of NBC Universal, the network pulled out of Qubo and replaced it with the preschool- targeted NBC Kids in 2012, which was programmed by new sister network Sprout. The growing regulatory scrutiny, increasing competition from cable channels such as Cartoon Network, Disney Channel and Nickelodeon (which benefited from synergy and cross-promotion with The WB, ABC and CBS's children's blocks respectively), as well as video on-demand services, made non-educational Saturday morning programming less viable for networks. In June 2014, The CW, whose Vortexx block (programmed by Saban Brands) made it the last major U.S. network to still program non-educational programming on weekend mornings, announced that it would replace it with an E/I-centric block for the next television season. = Notable fines = In 2007, Univision agreed to a record $24 million fine for violations of the educational programming regulations across 24 of its stations, after falsely asserting that several youth-targeted telenovelas (such as Cómplices Al Rescate) were educational in nature. Airings of anime on Kids' WB induced notable violations of the program-length commercial restrictions. The network aired several commercials during the Pokémon anime for products with Pokémon-related tie-ins (such as Eggo waffles, Fruit by the Foot, and the Nintendo e-Reader accessory for the Game Boy Advance). The FCC fined individual affiliates of The WB and upheld the fines on appeal (despite WCIU-TV trying to defend itself by arguing that the references were \\"fleeting\\"), even though it was the network which transmitted the content. In 2010, KSKN in Spokane, Washington was similarly fined $70,000 for having, on multiple occasions, aired an advertisement for a local collectibles shop during Yu-Gi-Oh!, which contained references to its eponymous trading card game as among products sold there. In 2004, Disney and Viacom were respectively issued $1 million and $500,000 fines for violating the limits on advertising during children's programming on ABC Family and Nickelodeon. The fines were levied by the Federal Trade Commission, not the FCC, because the two channels were cable-exclusive and outside the FCC's purview. = Shift in demographics and content = In the early 2010s, broadcasters began to change the manner in which they addressed their E/I obligations, shifting to blocks of factual, documentary- and reality-style series aimed at a teen (13–16 years old) audience, in lieu of conventional children's programs (such as cartoons). Throughout the decade, ABC (Litton's Weekend Adventure), CBS (CBS Dream Team), The CW (One Magnificent Morning), and NBC (The More You Know) all leased their weekend morning blocks to Litton Entertainment to air such programming. After dropping 4Kids TV in 2008 (which by then, had only scheduled a single half-hour of E/I programming within) in favor of programming a national block of infomercials under the internal title \\"Weekend Marketplace\\", Fox entered into a similar arrangement with Steve Rotfeld Productions to produce the STEM-based block Xploration Station for its affiliates. It premiered in September 2014. As they are only applied to programs targeting viewers 12 and younger, these programs are not subject to the advertising restrictions prescribed by the Children's Television Act. Litton faced criticism from Peggy Charren's daughter Claudia Moquin, for including product placement from \\"underwriters\\" in some of its programs (such as Electronic Arts, Norwegian Cruise Line, and SeaWorld), which, when combined with the lack of restrictions on commercial time, were described as a contravention of the spirit of the CTA. Litton defended its practices, stating that its programming was designed to meet \\"child psychologist-developed standards that did not exist prior to 1990\\", and considered them to be a preferential alternative to airing ads for junk food and toys instead. PBS member stations have been an exception to this trend, with the network's PBS Kids block continuing to largely air animated, educational series catered towards a preschool audience.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The monument, which was built from 1880 to 1881, was individually listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. History A movement to erect a monument began in 1865 when an association was created to establish a monument to President Abraham Lincoln after his assassination. The Lincoln Monument Association of Scott County, Iowa was incorporated on May 25, 1865. After six years the association collected $529.25, with the accumulated interest of $148.50, the total amount they had for the monument amounted to $707.40. Nicholas Fejervary offered to donate $1,300 if the monument would be erected to Scott County's Civil War dead instead. After accepting the offer, donations to the monument fund increased. The association hired R.J. Carver of South Rydate, Vermont to design the monument. The monument association approved the design on June 5, 1880. A site was chosen in the middle of Main Street between Grace Cathedral, now Trinity Cathedral, and Griswold College, now the campus of Davenport Central High School. The monument was built for $8,000. It was constructed 1880-1881 and dedicated on July 4, 1881. The monument was given to the city of Davenport on January 15, 1906. At one time patriotic exercises were held at the monument each Memorial Day by the local Grand Army of the Republic post, the Loyal Legion, the Sons of Veterans, the Woman's Relief Corps and other patriotic organizations. Architecture The monument is an obelisk of English Granite that rises . It is topped by a statue of a Union soldier, which faces south towards the Mississippi River in the valley below. He measures tall. The base for the monument is square, with buttress extensions at the corners. The monument's foundation is at least in the ground and is composed of Nauvoo stone and it rests on a cement floor. There are four panels with inscriptions on each side of the monument. The south panel reads: \\"Erected by Grateful Citizens of Scott County In Memory of the Fellow Citizens who Died in Defense of the Union 1861-5\\". The west panel bears a quote from General H. W. Halleck: \\"Proved themselves the Bravest of the Brave\\". The panel on the north bears a quote taken from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: \\"They died, that the government of the People, by the People and for the People might not perish from the Earth.\\" The east panel's quote is from Inspector General W. E. Strong: \\"An Honor to their Friends at Home, to their State and their Country a Terror to their Foes.\\" The lower section of the shaft features bas reliefs of the following emblems: the coat of arms of the United States (south); heavy crossed sabers, belt, cartridges and revolvers, which represent the cavalry (west); crossed cannon, which represent the artillery (north); and an anchor and shot, which represent the navy (east). On the first plinth above the lower section of the column, are emblematic wreaths. Over the U.S. coat of arms is the laurel-representing joy; over the cavalry symbols, the ivy-representing lasting remembrance; over the artillery symbols, the oak- representing strength; and over the naval symbols, the olive-representing peace. The two plinths above the second and third sections of the column have the names of the battles in which local soldiers fought engraved on each side of the column. The battles listed are: Shilo, Donelson, Iuka, Wilsons Creek, Fort Blakely, Corinth, Prairie Grove and Vicksburg. The capstone at the top of the column features a shield and carving on each side. Above the capstone is a pedestal for the statue of a soldier who represents the infantry. At one time the monument was surrounded by an iron fence.

The inability of these axons to cross the midline results in anomalous axonal guidance and front-to-back projections within each hemisphere, rather than connecting between the hemispheres in the normal corpus callosum.

Early history The FBI Atlanta Field Office was formed in 1911 under the control of Special Agent Lewis Josiah Baley, who was the first and longest serving head of the field office in its history. He left the field office in 1919 when he was appointed the Chief of the bureau of Investigation. The Atlanta division played a key role in investigating the domestic terrorism case held in Atlanta in 1919. The office also played a role in the investigation on Alexander Berkman. First Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Atlanta Field Office The pressing matter of corruption within the Atlanta detention system had arisen once more. J Edgar Hoover, the then FBI director, ordered the division to find evidence of these allegations. They were also told to investigate the prison warden, in which they received reports that he was running the prison in a laid-back manner. A conspiracy was quickly uncovered by Atlanta officers which included bribery for special treatment. The Bureau's 1925 report led to a series of arrests of prison management officers. In the 1920 and 1930s, the office investigated and charged a number of white collar criminals. Post-9/11 In the post September 11 period, The Atlanta office—as with the rest of the Bureau—made terrorism a top priority. In order to prevent more attacks on the United States, the division increased terrorism efforts by expanding the divisions terrorism force, improving the inner machination of the office's information collection methods by initiating the Field Intelligence Group. In the case of Ehsanul Sadequee and Syed Ahmed, two men residing in Georgia who had ties to terrorists around the globe, these efforts were put to great use. The division helped investigate the matter. The subsequent investigations of these terrorists unraveled a conspiracy of terrorists in other parts of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bosnia and several other countries around the world. Currently the office handles a number of matters including child pornography, health care fraud, violent prison gangs, drug trafficking and many more areas of crime.

Life  Gunhild remained in England after her father's death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and received her education at Wilton Abbey. This was a centre of learning, which attracted many high-born women, both English and Norman. Matilda of Scotland was educated here, with her sister Mary. It was also the home of the poet Muriel. According to the Vita Wulfstani, while still living at Wilton as an adult, Gunhild began to go blind. St Wulfstan heard about her while visiting and made the sign of the cross before her eyes, at which she was healed. She once met Anselm of Canterbury and afterwards wrote to him that she intended to follow a religious life. However in 1093 she eloped with Alan the Red, then in his middle 50s. According to Danelaw, Gunhild was the heiress of her mother's claims to some counties, properties which had been acquired by Alan the Red, and it may be for this reason that she attracted Alan's attention. Other possibilities include political reasons, or love: Anselm, in a letter addressed to her at this time, stated that she and Alan the Red loved each other. In his letter to her, Anselm argued that although she had not been consecrated as a nun, she had stated her intention to lead a religious life and so should now return \\"the nun's habit\\". She apparently replied that she had stated this intention because she had been promised an abbacy, and that this promise not being fulfilled, she was under no obligation to return. The historian Richard Sharpe has argued that Alan the Red and Gunhild had a daughter named Matilda, who was the wife of Walter D'Aincourt. After Alan the Red's death shortly after the elopement in 1093, Gunhild settled with his brother Alan the Black, who was heir to his brother's vast estates. Anselm wrote to her again to refute her previous arguments and urge her again to return to Wilton. Some say she married Alan the Black, and she may have predeceased him.Honeycutt, p. 24 References Anglo-Norse women Anglo-Saxon women House of Godwin 11th-century English people 11th- century English women ","title":"Gunhild of Wessex"},{"id":"31185494","text":"Melody Aflam was a Canadian pay television channel that was owned by Ethnic Channels Group.

They are said to derive their name from the Hindi word pind-kattana, which means to cut the flour balls, an important ritual in Hindu funerals. Little is known about the origin of this community, and their status as Brahmin is barely recogonized by other Brahmin grouping. The Kuthaliya Bora are a strictly endogamous community, and practice clan exogamy. Their three main clans or gotras are the Kashyap, Bharadwaj and Sandilya. They live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own quarters and hamlets.  Present circumstances  The Kattaha are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, with special concentrations in the districts of Sitapur, Hardoi, and Unnao in Awadh, and the districts of Shahjahanpur and Bareillyin Rohilkhand. They speak various dialects of Hindi, such as Awadhi.

The plan was advocated by the French and German governments as one of many needed political responses to strengthen the EMU in areas which the European sovereign-debt crisis had revealed as being too poorly constructed. The pact was constructed as an attempt to incentivize increased implementation of structural reforms by each participating EU member state, to improve their performance within the four focus areas of the pact, through: (1) A regular bottom-up inter-governmental political dialogue (learning best practices from each other) and (2) A commitment for each state to include reform measures (freely chosen from a broad list of potential policy action responses) in their annual National Reform Programme for those of the areas found in critical need of improvement. It also featured a commitment to transpose and operationalize one of the Stability and Growth Pact fiscal rules directly into national legislation – to make it more effectively working, and a commitment to perform regular \\"structured dialogue\\" for enhanced tax policy coordination in EU. In May 2015, the European Political Strategy Centre (in-house think tank of the European Commission) upon its analysis of the latest set of submitted National Reform Programmes, declared the pact was in a dormant state (not being actively used or referred to by the majority of participating states), and recommended it should be revived by moving it from its current intergovernmental state to become an integrated part of the European Semester in the EU framework law. In the latest approved plan for reforming the EMU, this recommendation was adopted with a target for its transposition to take place at the latest in June 2017. Euro-Plus Pact The Euro-Plus Pact came with four broad strategic objectives along with more specific strategies for addressing these objectives. The four objectives are: *fostering competitiveness *fostering employment *contributing to the sustainability of public finances *reinforcing financial stability. An additional fifth issue is: *tax policy coordination Although for tax policy coordination, there is no requirement to achieve certain improvements or implement specific measures, as member states only more vaguely: > \\"commit to engage in structured discussions on tax policy issues, notably to > ensure the exchange of best practices, the avoidance of harmful practices, > and consideration of proposals to fight against fraud and tax evasion.\\" The four key objectives listed above are intended to be addressed with individualized measures by all member countries of the pact, unless a Member State can \\"show that action is not needed\\" in a specific area. While the pact comes with specific strategies, these are not compulsory. Specifically the pact states: > \\"The choice of the specific policy actions necessary to achieve the common > objectives remains the responsibility of each country, but particular > attention will be paid to the set of possible measures mentioned below.\\" Each member state commits at an annual frequency to \\"agree at the highest level on a set of concrete [policy] actions to be achieved within 12 months\\". The actions and initiatives taken by each member state across the four common key objectives, shall after having been agreed, then be noted as an explicit part of their \\"National Reform Program\\" and/or \\"Stability/Convergence Program\\" reports, being published annually in March/April. Finally, in addition to this: > \\"Member States also commit to consult their partners on each major economic > reform having potential spill-over effects before its adoption\\". =Competitiveness= This area of the pact, is the same as several European countries had to address in the 1980s by abolishing Wage Indexation. The need for competitiveness improvements will be evaluated for each country upon analysis of its national Unit Labour Cost (ULC), a quantitative measure of wage costs per unit produced or serviced, and is to be addressed by measures that will reduce the cost of labour and/or measures that will increase productivity. Each country will be responsible for the selection of its own specific policy actions to improve competitiveness, but should mainly pick and choose between the following reform types: ;Labour cost reducing measures: * Reforming the \\"wage setting arrangements\\", and where necessary adjust the \\"degree of centralisation in the bargaining process\\" and \\"wage indexation mechanisms\\". * Ensure wages in the public sector only increase at a modest pace (equal to or below the inflation rate), as this has a strong signaling effect on the wage setting in the private sector. ;Productivity increasing measures: * Deregulating industries by removing unjustified restrictions on professional services and the retail sector, so that competition and efficiency will increase. * Improve infrastructure. * Improve education systems. * Promote and/or invest in Research & Development and innovation initiatives. * Improve the business environment, notably by removing red tape and improving the regulatory framework (i.e. bankruptcy laws, commercial code). =Employment= This objective will be evaluated on basis of measured figures for the long-term unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate and labour participation rates. Beside of full employment being an objective by itself, a flexible all-inclusive labour market with security arrangements removing barriers for employees to conduct an increased amount of job shifts throughout their working career, also positively spill-over into improving the competitiveness. Each country will be responsible for the selection of its own specific policy actions to improve employment, but should mainly pick and choose between the following reform types: * Labour market reforms to promote the \\"flexicurity\\" model, reduce undeclared work, and increase labour participation. * Reforms to support lifelong learning of the already employed/educated working force. * Tax reforms: \\"lowering taxes on labour\\" and \\"taking measures to facilitate the participation of second earners in the work force\\". =Sustainability of public finances= This objective will be assessed on basis of the sustainability gap indicators (S0 for the short-term, S1 for the medium-term and S2 for the long-term), which the Commission already publish every third year in their fiscal sustainability report (as part of their work to calculate appropriate minimum Medium-Term budgetary Objectives for each EU member state). If the composite S0 indicator is above 0.43, it signals existence of too high risk for fiscal stress in the short-term, which call on implementation of immediate counter measures. If the fiscal gap indicators S1 and/or S2 indicators are positive, it means debt levels are forecast to become unsustainable in the medium-term and/or long-term under a no-policy-change assumption, because of increasing public expenditures caused by demographic factors. If such S1 or S2 sustainability issues arise, they are to be addressed through implementation of fiscal consolidation leading to sufficient annual improvements for the structural budget balance and/or by increasing the sustainability of pensions, health care and social benefits systems through the following expenditure saving reforms: * Aligning the effective retirement age with life expectancy, so that the pension system better can shoulder the demographic situation. * Limiting early retirement schemes, and using targeted incentives for older workers in the age tranche above 55 still to be employed. * Implement reforms to increase employment participation rates. * Healthcare system reforms, focused either on reducing overall costs through implementing more cost efficient systems, or alternatively introducing certain level of privately paid healthcare contributions. To further safeguard fiscal sustainability, one of the most stringent conditions of the pact is given with respect to also implementing national fiscal rules: > \\"Participating Member States commit to translating EU fiscal rules as set > out in the Stability and Growth Pact into national legislation.\\" When implementing a balanced budget amendment, Member States are free to choose the type of legislation instrument (i.e. constitutional law or framework law), as long as it impose a \\"sufficiently strong binding\\" condition and a \\"durable nature\\". The law-enforced rule, needs to be fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact rules, but the exact formulation of the rule is up for each country to decide, as it could either be a \\"debt brake rule, or a rule related to the primary balance or an expenditure benchmark rule.\\" Additionally, in case sub-national levels of the general government have autonomy to issue debt or other liabilities, the rule should ensure enforcement of fiscal discipline both at the national and sub-national levels. =Financial stability= The Financial stability will be measured quantitatively for each country with respect to its \\"level of private debt for banks, households and non-financial firms.\\" With assistance from the President of the European Systemic Risk Board, the countries will be regularly informed on their present state of macro-financial stability, and will be expected to put into place \\"national legislation\\" to resolve potential problems. In addition, all participating Member States commit to adopt a fully community acquis compliant national legislation for banking resolution. =Tax policy coordination= The Euro Plus Pact does not entail any specific commitments on tax policy initiatives, other than to briefly outline that member states commit to engage in discussions about it through a regular \\"structured dialogue\\". Tax policy coordination is expected to help strengthen the sharing of best practices and fight against tax fraud and evasion. Direct taxation remains a national competence for each Euro Plus Pact member to decide upon individually. The European Commission had presented a proposal to introduce a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) with appliance for all EU member states already back in March 2011, which if agreed could be a revenue neutral way to ensure consistency among national tax systems, while respecting national tax strategies - as it refrain to set a common tax rate. The Euro Plus Pact explicit mentioned, that its featured \\"structured dialogue\\" for \\"tax policy coordination\\", should also be used for the purpose to try and reach a future CCCTB agreement. The CCCTB proposal had still not reached any final agreement as of June 2015, which prompted the commission to announce they will now submit a relaunched less ambitious CCCTB proposal in 2016 - leaving out the more difficult \\"consolidation part\\" for later agreement - so that the core CCTB can be adopted more rapidly in the short-term. In November 2011, the Finance ministers of all 23 participating states agreed on the content and format of the regular \\"structured dialogue\\" on tax policy coordination. The dialogue was decided to focus on: Avoidance of harmful practices, fight against fraud and tax evasion, exchange of best practices, prospects for International Coordination, and other potential issues (including taxation challenges related to digital economy, stronger alignment of national tax systems in specific areas like the recently proposed CCCTB, financial transaction tax, environmental and energy taxation, sustainability of tax systems, and empirical analysis of the impact of tax changes on growth). It was agreed, to set up a regular monitoring and reporting to the highest political level (European Council meetings) by the end of each future Council presidencies, on the following issues: \\"progress within the structured dialogue, concrete results in the field of tax coordination, avenues explored and specific issues on which agreement could be reached\\". Status reports for the structured dialogue on tax policy coordination, were subsequently published in: June 2012, November 2012, June 2013, December 2013, June 2014, December 2014, and June 2015. These regular specific reports which focus on Euro Plus related taxation dialogues, supplement those being simultaneously published by the ECOFIN council - which produce status on all relevant tax dialogues conducted between all EU member states. The ECOFIN tax dialogue reports were also published in June 2012, November 2012, June 2013, December 2013, June 2014, December 2014, and June 2015. Participation On 25 March 2011 the proposal for economic measures and cooperation was adopted by the European Council and included as participants without any caveats the Eurozone member states as well as Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. The EU members which did not participate are Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden and the United Kingdom, all for different reasons. Croatia subsequently acceded to the EU in July 2013. Progress Eurozone economic health and adjustment progress according to Euro Plus Monitor Report 2011 The pact did not set up any structures or agreement for an independent monitoring of reform progress among its participating members. However, as a third party independent initiative aimed to keep institutional investors informed, the annual Euro Plus Monitor report conducts a comparative competitiveness ranking for all eurozone states and selected EU member states, as per the joint analysis and opinion of Berenberg Bank and the Lisbon Council. According to the Euro Plus Monitor report 2011, many eurozone member countries were found to be rapidly reforming to increase the competitiveness of their economies as of November 2011. The report also found that \\"Many of those countries most in need to adjust [...] are now making the greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness\\". Greece, Ireland, Malta and Spain are among the top five reformers among 17 countries included in the report. The monitor report was also published in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The original plan: The Competitiveness Pact The original plan was announced by Germany and France in February 2011 and called for six policy changes to be set as well as for a monitoring system to be implemented to ensure progress. The four objectives are: abolishing wage indexation, raising pension ages, creating a common base for corporate tax and adopting debt brakes. In the following sections the motivation for and criticism of each objective is summarized. ;Abolishing wage indexation Wage indexation is the process of adjusting wages to compensate for inflation, which reduces the value of money over time. Abolishing indexation would allow for real wages to decrease increasing the competitiveness of countries as it becomes less expensive to employ people. Understandably this policy objective has been called into question by some governments such as Belgium as it reduces people's purchasing power. ;Raising pension ages In countries with \\"pay as you go\\" pension systems, as most European countries have, raising pension ages has a very profound impact on government revenue as people who continue working will also pay taxes instead of requiring them. This too is a controversial proposal as can be seen in the 2010 French pension reform strikes. ;Creating a common base for corporate taxes Creating a \\"common base\\" is perceived by some as a first step in a process of unifying tax rates and as such has been opposed by countries such as Ireland, which have low corporate tax rates. The opinion of the European Commission is that having a common rules for calculating of the base amount over which the different national tax rates are applied is beneficial for the enterprises since it will reduce the administrative burden and costs of maintaining compliance with 27 different rule sets for corporate bookkeeping. ;Adopting debt brakes The word \\"debt brake\\" comes from the German \\"Schuldenbremse\\", an amendment to the constitution legally limiting the size of sovereign debt countries are allowed to run. These have been implemented in Switzerland in 2003 and in Germany in 2010.Schuldenbremse – Wikipedia, Retrieved 26 April 2011 Debt brakes can vary in strictness and details of the intended implementation are not yet clear, but the motivation for this rule is to create a legally binding policy instead of the current budget guidelines on deficits which have been not been implemented by member countries. Criticism The plan has been criticised for impinging on the sovereignty of countries, due to its authority to set policy in areas that were previously under national sovereignty. The reforms that the pact contain have also been criticised as being too harsh, or conversely called into question for not being strict enough in its requirements to implement reforms. On the other hand, some leaders agree that in order to avoid dangerous nationalisms and have fiscal and economic governance, it is necessary to transfer sovereignty.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 11th-century. The manuscript is written in gold and contains Gospel lessons for selected days. It was named as \\"Gospel of Theodosius\\".  Description  The codex contains lessons from the Gospel of John, Matthew, and Luke (Evangelistarium) on 204 parchment leaves measuring (). The text is written in large golden letters described by at least one observer as beautiful. It contains breathings (rough breathing and smooth breathing) and accents and some images. The text is divided into verses as in modern editions of the Bible. The text is written in Greek uncial letters in two columns per page and 16 lines per page. The manuscript contains lessons for selected days, opening with the Gospel lessons for the first five days of Easter week and followed by 65 more lessons from other parts of the yearly services.  History  According to tradition it was supposedly written by the Emperor Theodosius († 395). However, in 1864, J. Dury Geden called this absurd and suggested that Theodosius III (716) was probably intended. Today, it is now dated on palaeographical grounds as much later still. Scrivener dated the manuscript to the 9th-11th century, Gardthausen and C. R. Gregory dated it to the 10th or 11th century. It is presently assigned by the INTF to the 11th century. The manuscript was probably seen in 1761 by the Italian traveller, Vitaliano Donati, when he visited the Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai.

West also funded most of the cost of building the new Caversham Baptist Free Church a decade later, also by Waterhouse, which stands on the opposite side of the road. After the new church opened, the Memorial Hall was used as a school. In 1911 it was extended \\"...to find rooms for wholesome recreation and moral improvement for the young men of Caversham, and to increase the space available for religious teaching on Sundays in connection with the Caversham Free Church, of which the late Mr Ebenezer West was so generous a supporter.\\"Quoted in Malpas, p.34.

These changes prompted many to emigrate to Nova Scotia. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, thousands of Scots settled in eastern Nova Scotia. Through a pattern of chain emigration, settlers often chose to create new communities based on family connections, religious or political beliefs. The settlers faced new hardships such as a vastly different climate, however they persevered and began clearing land, building homes and outbuildings, cultivating their land and establishing new lives and communities.  Interpretation and collections  Highland Village Museum Spinning Wool Highland Village Museum depicts 4 distinct eras in the history of Nova Scotia’s Gaelic settlers. Gàidhealtachd na h-Albann, Gaelic Scotland 1770-1830s is depicted in the Black House (an Taigh dubh). Coille Mhór na h-Albann Nuaih, The Forests of Nova Scotia 1770-1850s is depicted in the Log House (an Taigh Logaichean), the Centre Chimney House (Taigh an t-Similer), and the Barn (an Sabal).

Visitors to Highland Village explore these 4 distinct eras of Nova Scotia’s Gaelic history while interacting with costumed animators throughout the historic buildings. The interpretation of this aspect of Nova Scotia’s history is enhanced by the inclusion of farm animals, traditional gardening and farming techniques, and other aspects of the life of the Gaels in this part of the world.

The current district attorney is John T. Chisholm, who has served since 2007.  History  The first Milwaukee County District Attorney was Charles James, who served a two-year term beginning in 1848. District attorneys from then until 2008 also served two-year terms in office. Since that year, the district attorney serves for four years. The position is not, and has never been, subject to term limits. In the first decade of the 1900s, district attorney Francis E. McGovern and his office investigated and prosecuted corrupt city officials. The administration of Mayor David Rose was notorious for this, often ignoring illegal activity. Rose, although termed by McGovern \\"the self- elected, self-appointed attorney general\\" of local crime, was not indicted but was defeated in the 1910 mayoral election by Socialist Emil Seidel.  Responsibilities  The district attorney's office is responsible for prosecuting state-level criminal offenses committed in Milwaukee County. The office also prosecutes county ordinance violators. Separate units within the office prosecute offenses such as violent crimes, sexual assault, domestic violence, white-collar crimes, and drug-related crimes, among others. The office also contains a unit devoted to prosecuting misdemeanor offenses.  Notable district attorneys  *Charles James was the first district attorney, serving for two years (1848–1850). *Francis E. McGovern was responsible for the investigation and indictment of corrupt City of Milwaukee officials during David Rose's mayoral administration. McGovern was elected governor of Wisconsin in 1910. *Herbert Steffes, a Progressive in office from 1936 to 1944, was appointed by Governor Philip La Follette after his victorious election opponent died before polls closed on Election Day. Steffes later broke from the Progressives after prosecuting La Follette's executive secretary. *William J. McCauley, district attorney from 1945 to 1964, was the longest-serving district attorney at the time of his death in office, a record since exceeded by E. Michael McCann, who McCauley hired. *Hugh R. O'Connell, who served from 1964 to 1968, later served as a Milwaukee County circuit judge. *David J. Cannon, district attorney from 1968 to 1969, later served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. *E. Michael McCann, district attorney from 1969 until 2007, prosecuted serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and off-duty police officers who battered Frank Jude, Jr..  Employees  The district attorney's office is composed of about 125 assistant district attorneys, who are supervised by four deputy district attorneys and a chief deputy district attorney.

To produce the film's musical soundtrack, McLaren photographed rectangular cards with lines on them. He arranged these shapes in sequences on the analog optical sound track to produce notes and chords. He then reproduced the sequence of shapes, colorized, in the image portion of the film, so that audiences see the shapes that they are also hearing, as sound. McLaren had experimented with this technique for creating notes through patterns of stripes on the soundtrack area of the film in the 1950s, working with Evelyn Lambart. Their technique was based on earlier work in graphical sound by German pioneer Rudolf Pfenninger and Russian Nikolai Voinov. The creation of Synchromy was documented by Gavin Millar in 1970 in a film called The Eye Hears, The Ear Sees. In McLaren's production notes, he stated that \\"Apart from planning and executing the music, the only creative aspect of the film was the “choreographing” of the striations in the columns and deciding on the sequence and combinations of colours.\\" The film received eight awards, including a Special Jury Mention at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

In December 2009 he was arrested in Cuba while working on a program funded under the 1996 Helms–Burton Act, which explicitly called for overthrow of Castro's government. He was prosecuted in 2011 after being accused of crimes against the Cuban state for furtively bringing military-grade communication equipment designed to evade detection to members of Cuba's Jewish community. After being accused of working for American intelligence services in January 2010, he was convicted of spying and for \\"acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the state\\" in March 2011. US sources widely rejected the idea that Gross was a spy, though some noted the \\"covert\\" nature of Gross's work. Gross noted in his field reports his awareness of the risks he was taking in his mission. He was released from Cuban prison on December 17, 2014 and returned to the US in exchange for the release and return of three Cubans convicted of espionage.Elise Labott, \\"Cuba releases American Alan Gross in prisoner swap\\", CNN (December 17, 2014). While serving his prison sentence, his wife Judy Gross, sued Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI) and USAID for $60 million in federal court. The company settled for an undisclosed sum. Whatever the amount, it's in addition to $3.2 million that USAID agreed to pay Gross and DAI in November before he was released. Life and career Gross was born in Rockville Centre, Long Island, New York state into a Jewish family to Fred Gross (1921–2006) and Evelyn H. Gross (née Kessel; 1922–2014). He was raised at his hometown and in Baltimore. He studied sociology at the University of Maryland and social work at Virginia Commonwealth University, before moving to Potomac, Maryland. He had a long career as an international development worker who had been active in some 50 countries and territories across the Middle East, Africa and Europe, including Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was setting up satellite communications systems to NGOs. In 2001, he founded JBDC LLC, a small company that earned less than $70,000 in 2009, which supported \\"Internet connectivity in locations where there [is] little or no access,\\" according to The New York Times. Gross and his wife Judy lived in Potomac, Maryland, a Washington, D.C. suburb. The couple have two daughters, Shira and Nina. Arrest and trial =Background= Gross was working with Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI), a contractor working with USAID, which had won a $6 million U.S. government contract for the program in which Gross was involved, a controversial \\"democracy-promotion program\\" that ballooned under the George W. Bush administration, to provide communications equipment to break the Cuban government's 'information blockade.' Gross received less than $300,000. He spoke little Spanish and had not worked in Cuba before. USAID's $20 million Cuba program, authorized by a law calling for regime change in Cuba, has been criticized in congressional reports, which called it wasteful and ineffective and accused it of putting people in danger. Funding was held up briefly in 2010 over concerns following Gross's arrest. According to American officials, Gross visited Cuba four times in five months in 2009 on a tourist visa before his arrest to deliver computer and satellite equipment to three Jewish community groups. In December 2009, according to DAI, he was on a follow-up trip researching how the groups were making use of the equipment he had previously distributed to them. As reported by The Jewish Daily Forward, Cuba's small Jewish community, numbering fewer than 2,000 people who mainly live in Havana, enjoys full religious freedom, the possibility to emigrate to Israel and fairly good relations with the government under Raúl Castro, but has little influence, making observers wonder why the United States provides material to them under a USAID program that usually targets dissidents. According to a Latin America specialist for the Council on Foreign Relations, it is possible that Gross’s mission was useful only inasmuch as it satisfied Congressional demands to take action in Cuba. In January 2012, it was reported that Cuban authorities claimed that Gross has visited Cuba as early as 2004, delivering a video camera to a leading Freemason who later declared that he had been a Cuban intelligence agent since 2000. Gross filed reports for DAI of his four visits to Cuba in 2009. The report of the fifth and final trip was written by DAI. A review of the reports was revealed on February 12, 2012, by the Associated Press (AP). According to the reports, Gross was aware of the risks he was taking. AP reports that Gross did not identify himself as a representative of the U.S. government, but claimed to be a member of a Jewish humanitarian group [this is inaccurate- this is accurate. Statement from a very reliable source that Gross was part of a humanitarian group]. To escape Cuban authorities' detection, he enlisted the help of American Jews to transport electronic equipment, instructing them to pack items a piece at a time in carry-on luggage, and also traveled with American Jewish humanitarian groups undertaking missions on the island so he could intercede with Cuban authorities if questions arose. Gross declared that he was thoroughly inspected by the customs officials at Jose Marti International Airport when entering the country and that he declared all of the items in his possession. The equipment he brought to Cuba on his fourth trip, most but not all of which is legal in Cuba, included 12 iPods, 11 BlackBerry Curve smartphones, three MacBooks, six 500-gigabyte external drives, three satellite modems known as BGANs, three routers, three controllers, 18 wireless access points, 13 memory sticks, three VoIP phones, and networking switches. In his report on this trip, marked as final, he summarized: “Wireless networks established in three communities; about 325 users”. However, he went to Cuba for a fifth time in late November 2009 and was arrested 11 days later. When he was arrested, he was carrying a high-tech chip, intended to keep satellite phone transmissions from being located within . The chip is not available on the open market. It is provided most frequently to the CIA and the United States Department of Defense, but can also be obtained by the United States Department of State, which oversees USAID. Asked how Gross obtained the card, a USAID spokesman said that the agency played no role in helping Gross acquire equipment. =Arrest= Gross was arrested on December 3, 2009, at the Havana airport. He was jailed first at Carlos J. Finlay Military Hospital, then Villa Marista prison, a detention center. According to classified U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, the arrest came amid heightened tensions between Cuba and the U.S. Gross spent 25 days in jail before receiving his first visit from a U.S. diplomat, but was visited by a Cuban attorney earlier and was allowed to telephone his wife four days after his arrest on December 6 for the first time and again on December 23. During the one-hour visit by the representative of the United States Interests Section in Havana on December 28, 2009, Gross stated that Cuban officials were \\"treating him 'with respect,\\" though his interrogation had been \\"very intense at first,\\" lasting an average of two hours a day. According to the cable, the cell Gross had to share with two other men had a TV and a fan. The attorney who visited Gross in jail, Armanda Nuria Piñero Sierra, was hired as Gross's lawyer and handled his trial and appeals. She also represented the families of five Cubans held in U.S. prisons after being convicted in 2001 on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage against U.S. military installations, leading to the immediate speculation after Gross's arrest that Cuba wanted to swap him for the five. In October 2011, it was revealed that the U.S. State Department had offered to let one of them who had been released from prison in the U.S. on probation serve the remainder of his probation in Cuba in exchange for Gross's release. U.S. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said Gross's treatment was an attempt by Cuba to get a \\"concession.\\" Many Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the American Jewish Committee, protested against his detention. =Charges= In January 2010, Ricardo Alarcón, the president of the Cuban National Assembly, said that Gross was \\"contracted to work for American intelligence services,\\" which was denied by both the U.S. government and Gross's attorneys. More than a year later, in February 2011, Gross was charged not with espionage but with \\"acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the state\\" (\\"Actos Contra la Independencia o la Integridad Territorial del Estado\\"), a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Gross's trial was set for March 4, 2011. =Sentencing= On March 12, 2011, Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison. According to the Cuban News Agency, he had been part of a \\"subversive project of the U.S. government that aimed to destroy the Revolution through the use of communication systems out of the control of authorities.\\" Gross's wife attended the trial with her attorney. Three U.S. officials also attended as observers. Gross's case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Cuba, which affirmed the sentence in August 2011. =Reactions and advocacy= Alan Gross with his wife Judy, attorney Scott Gilbert, Rep.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. watch television on board a U.S. government plane headed back to the U.S. as the news breaks of his release, Dec. 17, 2014. After the sentence was passed, Gross's American attorney, Peter J. Kahn, said in a written statement: \\"The Gross family is devastated by the verdict and harsh sentence announced today by the Cuban authorities. Having already served a 15-month sentence in a Cuban prison, Alan and his family have paid an enormous personal price in the long-standing political feud between Cuba and the United States.\\" Kahn pledged to \\"continue to work with Alan's Cuban attorney in exploring any and all options available to him, including the possibility of an appeal.\\" He also called for Gross's immediate release on humanitarian grounds. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor responded to the ruling, saying that it \\"adds another injustice to Alan Gross's ordeal,\\" and that \\"he has already spent too many days in detention and should not spend one more,\\" and asked for \\"the immediate release of Mr. Gross so that he can return home to his wife and family.\\" United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Gross had been \\"unjustly jailed for far too long…He needs to be able to leave Cuba and return home,\\" adding \\"this is a matter of great personal pain to his family and concern to the U.S. government.\\" Several members of Congress visited Cuba to see Gross. The Jewish community and others called on Pope Benedict XVI to appeal to Raul Castro during his visit to Cuba in March 2012 to release Gross. Gross's wife, after fighting to persuade the organized Jewish community to rally behind a humanitarian campaign to free her husband, publicly criticized President Barack Obama and U.S. policy toward Cuba. In a March 13, 2012 interview with \\"Politico,\\" after having hired the public relations company Burson-Marsteller on the State Department′s recommendation, she called her husband a \\"pawn\\" in a \\"failed policy\\" between the Cuban and American governments, adding \\"the trial wasn’t about him. It was about USAID and U.S. policy towards Cuba.\\" Gross reportedly insisted that his \\"goals were not the same as the program that sent [him],\\" and called on the Obama administration to meet Cuba at the negotiating table to solve bilateral issues between the two states, including his case. Incarceration In April 2014, he went on a hunger strike for nine days. In August 2014, his wife reported on their official website, www.bringalanhome.org, that Gross refused to see her or their daughter when they went to see him in Cuba, and also refused to see visitors from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, such as U.S. diplomats. In August 2014, his wife and daughter wrote on their official website that Gross told them not to visit him again and in December 2014 it was reported that they had not. Gross was housed in the Carlos J. Finlay Military Hospital with two other inmates who spoke Spanish. Gross reportedly spoke some Spanish. It was reported in December 2014 that Gross refused to be treated by doctors in Cuba and had threatened to go on hunger strikes if he was not unconditionally released. During the course of Gross's incarceration, he was visited on several occasions by persons traveling to Cuba on behalf of the American government. On one occasion, he was visited by Senator Bernie Sanders, and recalled Sanders saying that he didn't understand why people were so critical of Cuba. This later led Gross to oppose Sanders' campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. =Health= When arrested, Gross weighed . From the start of his incarceration, he lost considerable body weight. Gross refused medical and dental care. According to his wife and attorney, Gross's health had deteriorated during his incarceration and this was a reason to release him immediately. They also claimed he had degenerative arthritis and had difficulty walking. In May 2012, a mass developed on his right shoulder, which was diagnosed by Cuban doctors as a hematoma (collection of blood). Gross's family hired a U.S. radiologist who claimed that the mass was improperly diagnosed, and that Gross could be suffering from cancer so Gross should be released on that basis. Gross's former lawyer, Jared Genser, issued a press release saying he had filed a petition with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. At the same time, \\"extremely concerned about Alan Gross's health,\\" the U.S. State Department called for Gross's immediate release. Meanwhile, the president of the Hebrew Community of Cuba (Spanish: \\"Casa de la Comunidad Hebrea de Cuba\\"), Adela Dworin, who visited Gross in jail several times, claimed that Gross \\"looked very agile\\" and was not particularly worried about the mass on his shoulder. In November 2012, the Miami Herald reported that New York Rabbi Elie Abadie, who is also a physician, told the Associated Press that “Alan Gross does not have any cancerous growth at this time, at least based on the studies I was shown and based on the examination, and I think he understands that also,\\" after personally examining Gross and receiving a briefing from a team of Cuban physicians who attended him. The Cuban Foreign Affairs Ministry, in a statement detailing a meeting between diplomats of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, a doctor and nurse from the U.S. mission, and members of the Cuban medical team that presented the results of the biopsy performed on the lesion behind Gross's right shoulder, confirmed that the hematoma was not cancerous. The Cuban Government also maintained that Gross's health was normal for a man his age and that he was being properly treated after having stated a few months earlier that Gross, who was held at a military hospital, \\"could be held at any prison facility,\\" meaning that he was in good and stable health. In December 2014, Gross released a statement complaining that his teeth had fallen out and that he had lost weight while at the same time stating that he was refusing all medical and dental care because he wanted to be immediately released from prison. Lawsuits In November 2012, Gross and his wife Judith sued DAI and USAID for failing to adequately prepare, train and supervise him given the dangerous nature of the program's activities. Reportedly, they were seeking $60 million compensatory damages. In November 2013, it was announced that DAI and Gross and his wife had reached a confidential settlement. Gross and his wife filed another lawsuit, reportedly seeking $10 million from Gross's insurer, the Federal Insurance Company, for benefits they say the company had denied. Release In November 2014, The New York Times called for the United States to engage in a prisoner swap with Cuba. On December 17, 2014, the Cuban government released Gross on humanitarian grounds and allowed him to return to the United States on a U.S. government plane. Some members of the Cuban Five were also released on December 17, 2014, although the governments characterized the two releases as being unconnected. This exchange was part of the larger Cuban thaw, which occurred for a brief period towards the end of the Obama administration, and which saw improvements in diplomatic and trade relations between the United States and Cuba.

Green runs MSSL's public engagement programme and sits on the board of the European Solar Physics Division (ESPD) of the European Physical Society and the advisory board of the Science Museum. In 2013 Green became the first ever female presenter of The Sky at Night following the death of Sir Patrick Moore. Green's research focuses primarily on the atmospheric activities of the Sun, particularly coronal mass ejections and the changes in the Sun's magnetic field which triggers them. Early life and education Green studied at Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedfordshire, gaining 9 GCSEs and 4 A-levels. After completing her A-levels, Green took a year out during which time she studied art, before deciding to pursue physics and completed her undergraduate Master of Physics degree in Physics with Astrophysics at the University of Sussex, graduating with a 2:1. Green completed her PhD in solar physics at the MSSL at UCL in 2002. She returns to her old school to discuss her research. Fiona Clements, Green's former physics teacher at the school, has said, “She is a great advocate for young women in science and we are proud that she continues to remember the school by returning to talk about her research to pupils.\\" \\"I always liked physics from an early age while I was at school.

It is believed they were made for Anne Drury, Lady Drury, wife of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead and Hardwick, who died in 1624. They were removed to Hardwick House, probably by Sir Robert, before 1615; and when the Hardwick House contents were sold in 1924, they were purchased for and installed in Christchurch Mansion when it had already become the home of the Fine and Decorative Arts collections of the Ipswich Museum. The panels contain a series of emblems of the kind associated with emblem books—images fashionable throughout Europe for private religious meditation in that age. The original sequence of the emblems is unclear, although the panels as arranged under their Latin \\"headings\\" are as originally devised. In addition to their importance for the study of emblems in general, they are significant because the Drurys were patrons of the poet and divine John Donne, who wrote his two Anniversaries following the death in 1610 of their daughter Elizabeth Drury—namely, An Anatomy of the World and The Second Anniversarie or the Progresse of the Soule. The epigrammatic and verbally or visually paradoxical themes of the paintings are, however, linked more directly to the themes and techniques of meditation developed in the writings and sermons of the preacher Joseph Hall, who was chaplain and spiritual advisor to Lady Drury at Hawstead.

He was the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team from 1980 to 1984. Early years Giordano attended Notre Dame High School, a Catholic high school located in the Detroit suburb of Harper Woods, Michigan. He graduated in 1961 and later graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit. Hockey coach at Harper Woods Notre Dame Giordano returned to Harper Woods Notre Dame High School as a teacher and hockey coach. He was the hockey coach at Notre Dame from 1969 to 1979. He led the Notre Dame hockey team to a Michigan state championship in 1972. While at Notre Dame, he coached future NHL player John Blum. Actor Dave Coulier also played hockey for Giordano in the 1970s. Coulier later recalled: \\"Giordano wasn't real happy when I made the guys laugh. He was very serious. Not a great combination with my constantly goofing-around personality. We had team curfews, haircuts, and if you didn't wear a suit to the games, you were benched.\\" Hockey coach at Michigan In 1979, Giordano was hired as an assistant hockey coach at the University of Michigan working under head coach Dan Farrell. Giordano was reunited at Michigan with John Blum, who had joined the Wolverines after graduating from Notre Dame High School. During the 1979-1980 hockey season, Giordano was in charge of the Wolverines' power play. Giordano was credited with molding the unit into \\"the most potent power play in the country,\\" scoring on 40% of power play opportunities. In the spring of 1980, Farrell resigned as Michigan's head coach and was replaced by former Wolverine hockey star Wilf Martin. In the fall of 1980, the Michigan hockey team became embroiled in two major controversies. First, a hazing scandal dominated press coverage of the team in October. Veteran players reportedly forced a freshman player to drink large quantities of gin, vodka and beer, stripped him of his clothes, shaved his body from the neck down, covered him with jam, eggs and cologne, dumped him in the trunk of a car, and left him nearly unconscious in freezing weather. This was later found not to be true and the players actually returned the player, (J T Todd) to his dorm. Todd, who was walk-on from Detroit left the team. Second, head coach Martin developed health problems, reported in the press to be an emotional disorder, during the exhibition season. Martin coached only two games during the 1980-1981 season, and announced his resignation in late November 1980. Giordano took over, initially as interim head coach, for a Michigan hockey team in crisis. Giordano was praised for his efforts in leading the team to a 23-17 record during the 1980-1981 season. The Michigan Daily noted: > \\"The Wayne State graduate was faced with a very adverse set of circumstances > from the outset, including the loss of Michigan's top three scorers, being > picked to finish last in the WCHA by pre-season pollsters, and extremely > negative publicity surrounding the hazing incident.\\" Athletic director Don Canham added, \\"He took over in a bad situation and he's done a remarkably good job.\\" Giordano was named permanent head coach in early February 1981. At the end of the 1980-1981 season, he was named collegiate Coach of the Year by The Hockey News, WCHA Coach of the Year by The Denver Post, and WCHA Co-Coach of the Year with John MacInnes by the vote of WCHA coaches. In Giordano's second year as head coach, the Michigan hockey team moved from the highly competitive Western Collegiate Hockey Association (\\"WCHA\\") to the less-competitive Central Collegiate Hockey Association (\\"CCHA\\"). With the change in conferences, \\"the conventional wisdom was that the Wolverines would dominate the new circuit behind their successful young coach.\\" Instead, the Wolverines finished in fourth place in the CCHA during the 1981-1982 season with a record of 18-15-5.; The team continued to move in the wrong direction in Giordano's third and fourth years as head coach, finishing in ninth place in the CCHA both years with records of 14-22-0 and 14-22-1. Giordano's position as head coach was further undermined by lagging attendance (Michigan averaged approximately 3,000 fans per game during Giordano's final two years as head coach) and a players' mutiny. Giordano had a reputation as a disciplinarian. Among other things, he strictly enforced curfews and ordered extra 6 a.m. practices when the team failed to perform. He was also alleged to have stripped seven players of their scholarships. In the spring of 1984, all 22 Michigan hockey players signed a petition listing their grievances and stating that Giordano was \\"an embarrassment to all of us in front of other coaches and players.\\"Bacon 2001 at 232-233. Athletic director Don Canham later recalled: > \\"I never talk to players about their coaches. I coached myself, and I know > enough not to do that. But when all 22 players walked into my office the > second time with a signed petition to say this situation is intolerable – > well, I just had to let him go. He just never could get along with the > players.\\" In his history of the Michigan hockey program, historian John U. Bacon noted: \\"In reporting the decision, the Michigan Daily described Giordano as being 'very unpopular with the players, parents, fans and alumni' – which didn't leave many in his corner.\\" Giordano was replaced as the head coach of the Michigan men's ice hockey team by Red Berenson, who retired from the position in 2017 after 33 seasons.

As of 2006 there were approximately 3,000 Muslims in New Hampshire. Origins The society originated among the Muslim Student Association at Southern New Hampshire University. They initially held their Friday prayers in a room on campus that the school allocated to them. Southern New Hampshire University economics professor Mahboubul Hassan was the advisor to the organization. After SNHU sold the part of campus that hosted the meetings, the group began planning to build a mosque, working with Muslim immigrants who settled in New Hampshire. In 1998 the Islamic Society of Greater Manchester was created to pursue this task, and the society has been engaged in efforts to build a mosque in Manchester ever since. Mahboubul Hassan then became the president of the society. While the mosque is being built, they hold prayer meetings in the headquarters of the society. Their offices have been located in several different places, including a dance studio and the basement of a beauty school. Mosque In 1999 the society was twice denied permits to build a mosque in a rural area of east Manchester by the city of Manchester's Zoning Board of Adjustment and filed a lawsuit in response. The city of Manchester allowed the group to re-submit their plans in 2003. City officials had opposed the building plans because the road leading to the building site was of very poor quality, parking was limited, and blasting would be required. After the planning board approved the plans, neighboring residents individually sued to stop the construction, claiming that they owned a portion of the land. In 2005 a judge ruled in favor of the society, and they were able to begin construction. New Hampshire state representative Saggy Tahir has been a vocal supporter of the planned mosque. Siraj Wahhaj of Al-Taqwa mosque in Brooklyn traveled to New Hampshire to speak at a fundraiser for the project. After construction began, local pastors and the Greater Manchester Interfaith Council called on local churches to volunteer to help with the construction. The move caused some controversy among local residents, some of whom were vocally opposed to allowing the construction of a mosque. Construction commenced, however, though it often proceeded slowly due to unexpected costs. The society plans to build a three- level domed octagonal building. It will not have a minaret or loudspeakers. The building site has been regularly vandalized, although vandalism was an issue for the previous owners as well. Other activities Leaders of the society engage in efforts to build tolerance for Muslims among New Hampshire residents and participate in interfaith activities. Some of them met with New Hampshire law enforcement officials and hosted gatherings with FBI officials designed to combat harassment of local Muslims. Such gatherings have been hosted in the wake of the September 11 attacks and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Organisms capable of living in such harsh conditions are referred to as extremophiles. Desiccation resistance The ability of Chroococcidiopsis to resist desiccation in arid environments is due in part because it colonizes the underside of translucent rocks. The underside of these rocks provides enough condensed moisture for growth while the rock's translucent nature allows just enough light to reach the organism for photosynthesis to occur. Mars colonization Due to its resistance to harsh environmental conditions, especially low temperature, low moisture, and radiation tolerance, Chroococcidiopsis has been thought of as an organism capable of living on Mars. Scientists have speculated about the possibility of introducing Chroococcidiopsis to the Martian environment to aid in the formation of an aerobic environment. In addition to oxygen production, Chroococcidiopsis could aid in the formation of soil on the Martian surface. On Earth, soil is formed by plant, microbial, and geophysical activity on a mineral substrate. The soil produced by chemical weathering of rocks and oxygen produced by photosynthesis could one day provide the conditions necessary for humans to grow food on Mars, possibly allowing for permanent human civilizations on the planet. On a shorter time scale, cyanobacteria such as Chroococcidiopsis could be used in closed systems to produce resources for manned outposts on Mars without altering the planet's surface or atmosphere. A space mission called EXPOSE-R2 was launched on 24 July 2014 aboard the Russian Progress M-24M, and was attached on 18 August 2014 outside the ISS on the Russian module Zvezda.

Soot, Eyolf (Nordisk familjebok Uggleupplagan . 26. 417-418) Biography Eyolf Soot was born in Aremark in Østfold, Norway. He was the grandson of engineer and canal builder, Engebret Soot. Large parts of childhood were spent in New York City where his father, Even Soot, worked as an engineer. His father died when Eyolf Soot was 17 years. Subsequently his mother left with her the children for Norway. They first lived in Lillehammer before they moved to Christiania (now Oslo) where Soot continued his artistic education at the Royal Drawing School and at the painting school of Knud Bergslien. Engebret Soot, Kanalbygger (Jan Wiig,forfatter. Norsk biografisk leksikon) In 1878, he spent five months at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe in Berlin under Karl Gussow and three months later in 1881 under Gyula Benczúr at the academy in Munich. Later, he was a pupil of Léon Bonnat in Paris. In 1882, he debuted at the first Autumn Exhibition in Oslo. He later participated at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers in Antwerp. Endowments gave Soot the opportunity to establish residence in Paris, where he was featured at the Exposition Universelle where he was honored with a silver medal. The decade 1885-1895 was generally recognized as his most productive period. From 1887 to 1888, Soot worked in Paris. From 1888 to 1890, Soot settled on a farm south of Lillehammer where he captured local images and landscapes. Among Soot paintings from this period is Velkommen (‘’Welcome’’), now owned by the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, perhaps the most widely recognized of his works.

Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October. Out of the ten tropical storms, seven reached hurricane intensity, of which four made landfall on the United States. The strongest hurricane was a Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity, one of four storms to do so. It left heavy damage, killing at least twelve people. The most notable hurricane of the season was the Saxby Gale, which was predicted nearly a year in advance. The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane-force winds in Maine, where it left heavy damage and flooding. The Saxby Gale left 37 deaths along its path, with its destruction greatest along the Bay of Fundy; there, the hurricane produced a 70.9 ft (21.6 m) high tide near the head of the bay.

Its entire track was unknown, and its existence was only confirmed for 24 hours, based on three ship reports. The second, a barque, the Prinze Frederik Carl, sustained damage to all of its sails. The Hurricane Research Division (HRD) assessed the storm to have moved northeastward in its limited duration, and based on the ship reports estimated peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h); this would make it a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. =Hurricane Two= The Lower Texas Coast Hurricane of 1869 Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 182-183 By August 16, a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana. With estimated winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), it tracked westward and struck Texas on Matagorda Island before passing near Refugio. The hurricane quickly weakened over land and dissipated late on August 17. Damage from the hurricane was heaviest in Refugio and Indianola. In the latter city, strong waves damaged wharves and boats while the storm surge flooded the streets with about of water. Intense winds knocked down several houses as well as a church, and many buildings lost their roofs. In Sabine Pass, the winds ruined a variety of fruit crops. =Hurricane Three= The third hurricane of the season was only known due to it affecting one ship. A vessel in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company reported a hurricane on August 27, about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. The storm was estimated to have been moving north-northwestward with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), although its entire track is unknown. =Tropical Storm Four= A tropical storm was first observed on September 1 to the east of the Bahamas. There, it left heavy damage to a brig sailing from Nassau to New York City. The storm tracked generally northeastward, damaging another ship on September 2 near Bermuda. =Hurricane Five= On September 4, a hurricane was located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, moving north-northwestward. The next day, it moved ashore in southeastern Louisiana with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h), passing west of New Orleans. It dissipated early on September 6. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path that caused flooding. In addition, strong winds uprooted trees and damaged fences. High tides flooded Grand Isle with of water. =Hurricane Six= The New England Gale of 1869 On September 7, three ships observed hurricane-force winds over the western Atlantic Ocean, between the Bahamas and Bermuda. The storm moved northward, impacting several other ships as it paralleled the east coast of the United States; one of them reported a pressure of 956 mbar (28.24 inHg), which indicated the system was an intense hurricane. Late on September 8, it reached a peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) with a pressure of 950 mbar (28.05 inHg). After brushing Long Island, the hurricane weakened slightly and made landfall on southwestern Rhode Island at peak intensity. It was one of three hurricanes, along with the 1938 New England hurricane and Hurricane Carol in 1954, to strike New England as a major hurricane, or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the hurricane was compact, estimated around wide. However, less than 10 miles (16 km) west of the center, there were no strong winds. The hurricane produced a storm surge of , which was lessened due to it moving ashore at low tide. In Providence, Rhode Island, high waves damaged coastal wharves and left flooding. The hurricane weakened quickly over land, passing just west of Boston early on September 9 as a minimal hurricane. There, the winds downed many trees and left severe damage. All telegraph lines between New York and Boston were cut, although the storm did produce beneficial heavy rainfall. Shortly thereafter it dissipated over Maine. There was one confirmed death in Massachusetts. Offshore Maine, a schooner capsized, killing all but one of the twelve crew. The storm also caused at least $50,000 (1869 USD) in damage in Maine alone.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 103-107 =Hurricane Seven= A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September 11. The storm tracked generally west- northwestward, affecting several other ships with damaging winds. On September 15, a ship traveling from St. Thomas to England encountered the hurricane and observed a minimum barometric pressure of 979 mbar (28.90 inHg); this suggested peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). By September 16 the hurricane had weakened slightly as its track turned to the north and northeast. It was last observed on September 18 to the west of the Azores as a tropical storm. =Tropical Storm Eight= The only basis for identifying the eighth tropical cyclone of the season was from a report by the bark Crescent Wave. On September 14, the ship encountered strong winds and heavy rainfall about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. At the time, the storm was at least east of the previous hurricane. =Tropical Storm Nine= On October 1, the brig Jenny observed \\"a revolting gale lasting 3 days\\" off the south coast of Puerto Rico, which indicated a tropical storm in the region. Despite being located near several islands in the Caribbean, no land stations experienced any effects from the storm. =Hurricane Ten= Saxby Gale The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October 4 by a ship off the southeast coast of North Carolina. With winds estimated at 105 mph (165 km/h), the storm tracked northeastward, passing just east of Martha's Vineyard before moving across Cape Cod late on October 4. As it moved along the coast, the storm produced heavy precipitation, reaching 12.25 in (311 mm) in Canton, Connecticut. The strongest winds did not affect Massachusetts, although a few hours later the hurricane struck just east of Portland, Maine at peak intensity. This made it one of six storms to produce hurricane-force winds in Maine, along with Hurricane Carol in 1953, Hurricane Edna in 1954, Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane Gerda in 1969, and Hurricane Gloria in 1985. In Maine, the high rainfall caused widespread flooding, while the high winds destroyed at least 90 houses. The hurricane quickly weakened over land, and after turning northeastward into Atlantic Canada dissipated on October 5 near the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The hurricane was referred as Saxby's Gale after Lieutenant S.M. Saxby of the Royal Navy predicted in November 1868 that an unusually violent storm would produce very high tides on October 5; he did not specify the location, however. Although heavy damage occurred in New England, the devastation was greatest in Atlantic Canada along the Bay of Fundy. The hurricane produced a storm surge of around , which, in combination with the winds, the low pressure, and being in a region of naturally occurring high tides, produced a 70.9 ft (21.6 m) high tide near the head of the bay. The high tides surpassed the dykes across New Brunswick and left widespread flooding, killing many cattle and sheep and washing away roads. In the Cumberland Basin, the floods washed two boats about 3 mi (5 km) inland. In Moncton, water levels rose about 6.6 ft (2 m) higher than the previous highest level. There were 37 deaths between Maine, New Brunswick, and New York.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 108-111  See also  *List of tropical cyclones *Atlantic hurricane season *Tropical cyclone observation *Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project References Atlantic hurricane seasons Articles which contain graphical timelines 1869 natural disasters 1860s meteorology ","title":"1869 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"31186294","text":"Charleston High School is a public high school in Charleston, Illinois, United States.

Research shows that illegal immigrants increase the size of the U.S. economy/contribute to economic growth, enhance the welfare of natives, contribute more in tax revenue than they collect, reduce American firms' incentives to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods, and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services. Economists estimate that legalization of the undocumented immigrant population would increase the immigrants' earnings and consumption considerably, and increase U.S. gross domestic product. Undocumented immigrant population Both the population of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. and southwestern border apprehensions have declined significantly over the past decade. According to the Pew Research Center, there were 11.3 million illegal immigrants living in the United States in 2016, statistically unchanged from the previous year. The number peaked at 12.2 million in 2007, following a steady increase that began in 1990. An estimated 5.6 million unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico in 2015 and 2016, down from 6.4 million in 2009. Non-Mexicans numbered 5.7 million, indicating Mexicans are no longer the clear majority of unauthorized immigrants. The U.S. civilian workforce includes 8 million unauthorized immigrants, accounting for 5% of those working or looking for work in 2014. This number has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging between 8.0 and 8.3 million. Unauthorized immigrants represent 26% of farming and 15% of construction labor. They are primarily concentrated in six states: California, New Mexico, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. About two- thirds have been in the U.S. for more than a decade. The reduction has been driven mainly by a decrease in the number of new immigrants from Mexico, the single largest source. Net immigration from Mexico to the U.S. has stopped and possibly reversed since 2010. At its peak in 2000, about 770,000 immigrants arrived annually from Mexico; the majority arrived illegally. By 2010, the inflow had dropped to about 140,000—a majority of whom arrived as legal immigrants. At its peak in August 2007, the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. was 12.5 million. This decreased by 1.3 million to 11.2 million by July 2008 (11%) due to either increased law enforcement or fewer job opportunities. Based on the Department of Homeland Security estimates in 2009, unauthorized immigrant population living in the United States decreased to 10.8 million in January 2009. On the whole, between 2000 and 2009, the unauthorized immigrant population grew by 27 percent. Immigrants to the U.S. are concentrated at both the high and low-income ends of the U.S. labor market, determined largely by their educational attainment. In 2004, at the low end, half of workers age 25 and older who lacked a diploma were from Mexico and Central America. These workers were employed in jobs that required little formal education, such as construction labor and dishwashing, and on average they earned much less than did the average native worker. Economic impact of undocumented immigrants =Consumer demand= An employer may benefit from the undocumented status of a migrant who is desperate for work and therefore prepared to accept poor pay, usually below local norms. If paid under the table rather than using an ITIN, the employer will have an advantage of various non-wage benefits like saving the bonus and overtime payment including the advantage of paying the undocumented worker at the minimum rate. Nearly every dollar earned by undocumented immigrants is spent immediately, and the average wage for US citizens is $10.25/hour with an average of 34 hours per week. This means that approximately 8 million US jobs are dependent upon economic activity produced by undocumented immigrant activities within the US. =Budgetary impact= A 2007 review of the academic literature by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that \\"over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use.\\" While the overall fiscal impact on the US is beneficial, unauthorized immigrants have an adverse impact on the budgets of state and local governments. While cautioning that the reports are not a suitable basis for developing an aggregate national effect across all states, they concluded that: * \\"State and local governments incur costs for providing services to unauthorized immigrants and have limited options for avoiding or minimizing those costs\\"; * \\"The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions\\"; * \\"The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants\\"; and * \\"Federal aid programs offer resources to state and local governments that provide services to unauthorized immigrants, but those funds do not fully cover the costs incurred by those governments.\\" IRS estimates that about 6 million unauthorized immigrants file individual income tax returns each year. Research reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that between 50 percent and 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes. Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about $7 billion per year into Social Security. In addition, they spend billions of dollars per year, which supports the US economy and helps to create new jobs. The Texas State Comptroller reported in 2006 that the 1.4 million unauthorized immigrants in Texas added almost $18 billion to the gross state product, and contributed $1.6 billion in state revenue, while costing the state about $1.6 billion in services used.Special Report – December 2006 Illegal Immigrants in Texas:A Financial Analysis of the Impact to the State Budget and Economy, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller The Social Security and Medicare contributions of illegal immigrants directly support older Americans, as illegal immigrants are not eligible to receive these services, although their children born in the United States are eligible for such benefits.“illegal Workers: Impact on Missouri’s Economy,” The Missouri Budget Project, June 21, 2006 and “Replacing the illegal Work Force,” Center for American Progress, March 2006. Illegal immigrants pay social security payroll taxes but are not eligible for benefits. During 2006, Standard & Poor's analysts wrote: \\"Each year, for example, the U.S. Social Security Administration maintains roughly $6 billion to $7 billion of Social Security contributions in an \\"earnings suspense file\\"—an account for W-2 tax forms that cannot be matched to the correct Social Security number. The vast majority of these numbers are attributable to undocumented workers who will never claim their benefits. For 2010, the Social Security Administration estimated that unauthorized immigrants and their employers paid $13 billion in required social security payroll taxes. The Social Security Administration has stated that it believes unauthorized work by non-citizens is a major cause of wage items being posted as erroneous wage reports instead of on an individual's earnings record.Administrative Challenges Facing the Social Security Administration. Congressional Testimony – March 14, 2006 When Social Security numbers are already in use; names do not match the numbers or the numbers are fake, or the person of record is too old, young, dead etc., the earnings reported to the Social Security Agency are put in an Earnings Suspense file. The Social Security spends about $100 million a year and corrects all but about 2% of these. From tax years 1937 through 2003 the ESF had accumulated about 255 million mismatched wage reports, representing $520 billion in wages and about $75 billion in employment taxes paid into the over $1.5 trillion in the Social Security Trust funds. As of October 2005, approximately 8.8 million wage reports, representing $57.8 billion in wages remained unresolved in the suspense file for tax year 2003. Estimates indicate that about 4% of the school-age population is made up of children who are illegal immigrants.The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local Governments,” Congressional Budget Office, Dec. 2009, p. 8. Many require remedial assistance in language skills, which increases costs to the public schools. During April 2006, Standard & Poor's analysts wrote: \\"Local school districts are estimated to educate 1.8 million undocumented children. At an average annual cost of $7,500 (averages vary by jurisdiction) per student, the cost of providing education to these children is about $11.2 billion.\\" Other estimates of the costs to educate unauthorized children and US-born children of unauthorized immigrants reached $30 billion in 2009.“S&P; Study: Costs and Benefits of illegal Immigrants,” Hispanic News, May 1, 2009, p. 2. Congressional Budget Office (2015) reports that “policies designed to improve verification of a person’s legal status at the workplace would target the estimated 8 million unauthorized residents who work.” Under the Administration’s deferred action programs, certain percentage of people have already received or will be receiving an authorization to work. There is the requirement saying that every new employee need to have the proof of the work authorization and their worker identity. However, there are still some workers left without the authorization. =Price levels= NPR reported in March 2006 that when the wages of lower- skilled workers go down, the rest of America benefits by paying lower prices for things like restaurant meals, agricultural produce and construction. The economic impact of unauthorized immigration is far smaller than other trends in the economy, such as the increasing use of automation in manufacturing or the growth in global trade. But economists generally believe that when averaged over the whole economy, the effect is a small net positive. Harvard's George Borjas says the average American's wealth is increased by less than 1 percent because of unauthorized immigration. According to the report presented by Eleanor Chelimsky and the team, hiring an illegal immigrant can have both negative as well as positive effects. For instance, if a restaurant hires a cheap labor of unauthorized workers, it will reduce the employer’s cost eventually leading them to reduce the price for the foods served in the restaurant. The illegal workers are hired by the employers in the companies, competing in the same market with similar businesses that are hiring the legal workers. Due to the competition on the products sold in that free market, increase in illegal immigration may decrease the wage rate of the legal workers. In case of the inflow of unauthorized workers reducing the costs of operation leading to the reduction of prices on a product/services provided, the demand for the services of legal workers with low-skill jobs (such as fast food restaurants, agricultural sectors and construction) will decrease. However, on a positive note, the reduced price on the menu will attract more customers increasing their volume of sales. As a result, this will “increase the demand for the noncompeting category of workers, such as chefs or waiters”. =Impact on wages= Protesters of Proposition 187 in Fresno, California in 1994 Economists have different conclusions regarding the impact on wages from immigration, both legal and illegal. It is challenging to separate the impact of illegal immigration (generally workers with lower educational attainment) from immigration overall. Studies generally conclude there is a small adverse impact on the wages of lower-skilled workers from immigration and some benefit for higher-skilled workers: *Research by economist David Card (University of California-Berkeley) indicated the effect of immigration on native born workers without high school degrees is limited, perhaps reducing the wages of high school dropouts by 5.1% over 20 years. *Harvard economist George Borjas wrote in 2007 that: \\"Economic theory implies that immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers. For example, an influx of foreign-born laborers reduces the economic opportunities for laborers — all laborers now face stiffer competition in the labor market. At the same time, high-skill natives may gain substantially. They pay less for the services that laborers provide, such as painting the house and mowing the lawn, and natives who hire these laborers can now specialize in producing the goods and services that better suit their skills.\\" Borjas' other research also indicated that \\"high-school dropouts experience a substantial wage loss from immigration of 6.3% in the short run and 3.1% over the long haul as labor markets adjust to the increased number of workers.\\" *A 2015 National Academy of Sciences report concluded that native-born workers who are substitutes for immigrants (e.g., lower-skilled workers in the case of illegal immigrants) \\"will experience negative wage effects.\\" The report continues: \\"In summary, the immigration surplus [overall net benefit from immigration] stems from the increase in the return to capital that results from the increased supply of labor and the subsequent fall in wages. Natives who own more capital will receive more income from the immigration surplus than natives who own less capital, who can consequently be adversely affected.\\" *The Brookings Institution reported in 2012 that: \\"[T]he most recent economic evidence suggests that, on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans. Based on a survey of the academic literature, economists do not tend to find that immigrants cause any sizeable decrease in wages and employment of U.S.-born citizens, and instead may raise wages and lower prices in the aggregate.\\" However, certain groups may be adversely affected. Brookings pointed to two studies at the opposite ends of the impact spectrum, one (Borjas-Katz 2007) indicating a 4.5% reduction in the wages of native workers that were high-school dropouts and a roughly 1.6% reduction for native college graduates, with another (Ottaviano- Peri 2008) indicating a small positive for all education levels. In 2008, Gordon H. Hanson at University of California–San Diego and National Bureau of Economic Research performed a study to see if illegal immigration affects native workers employment. From the study was concluded that unauthorized immigrants provide a source of manpower in agriculture, construction, food processing, building cleaning and maintenance, and other low-end jobs. Cities with a high percentage of illegal immigration were examined in this study and data showed that illegal immigrants overall impact on the US economy is small. On the other hand, US employers gain from lower labor costs and the ability to use their land, capital, and technology more productively. =Health care= Reuters reported that illegal immigrants, as well as legal immigrants in the country less than five years, generally are not eligible for Medicaid. However, they can get Medicaid coverage for health emergencies if they are in a category of people otherwise eligible, such as children, pregnant women, families with dependent children, elderly or disabled individuals, and meet other requirements. The cost of this emergency care was less than 1% of Medicaid costs in North Carolina from 2001–2004 and the majority was for childbirth and related complications. USA Today reported that \\"Illegal immigrants can get emergency care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor and people with disabilities. But they can't get non-emergency care unless they pay. They are ineligible for most other public benefits.\\" Because of the U.S. Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 (), most hospitals may not refuse anyone treatment for an emergency medical condition because of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. An example of the cost conflict between federal government, state and local government, and private institutions, the Immigration and Naturalization Service brings injured and ill unauthorized immigrants to hospital emergency rooms but does not pay for their medical care. Almost $190 million, or about 25 percent, of the uncompensated costs Southwest border county hospitals incurred resulted from emergency medical treatment provided to illegal immigrants. At least two research studies have been done which attempt to discover the cost of health care for illegal immigrants by asking the illegal themselves. * A phone survey in which Alexander Ortega and colleagues at the University of California asked illegal immigrants how often they receive medical care reported that illegal immigrants are no more likely to visit the emergency room than native born Americans. * A RAND study concluded that the total federal cost of providing medical expenses for the 78% illegal immigrants without health insurance coverage was $1.1 billion, with immigrants paying $321 million of health care costs out-of-pocket. The study found that illegal immigrants tend to visit physicians less frequently than U.S. citizens because they are younger and because people with chronic health problems are less likely to migrate. Moreover, studies have also shown that not providing illegal immigrants with a decent healthcare might actually cost the country in the long-run rather than save expenses. In 2000, researchers compared the perinatal outcomes and costs of illegal women with and without prenatal care and inferred the impact of denial of prenatal benefits to illegal immigrants in California. Nearly 10% of illegal women had no prenatal care. These women were nearly 4 times as likely to be delivered of low birth weight infants and more than 7 times as likely to be delivered of premature infants as were illegal women who had prenatal care. For every dollar cut from prenatal care, an increase of $3.33 in the cost of postnatal care and $4.63 in incremental long-term cost were expected. Elimination of publicly funded prenatal care for illegal women could save the state $58 million in direct prenatal care costs but could cost taxpayers as much as $194 million more in postnatal care, resulting in a net cost of $136 million initially and $211 million in long-term costs. Although their parents are illegal immigrants, these children are actually U.S citizens.Lu, M. C., Lin, Y. G., Prietto, N. M., & Garite, T. J. (2000). Elimination of public funding of prenatal care for illegal immigrants in California: a cost/benefit analysis. American journal of obstetrics and gynecology, 182(1), 233–239. =Effect on income inequality= Economist David Card wrote in 2009 that immigration (legal and illegal) has a minor impact on income inequality and wages: \\"Together these results imply that the impacts of recent immigrant inflows on the relative wages of U.S. natives are small. The effects on overall wage inequality (including natives and immigrants) are larger, reflecting the concentration of immigrants in the tails of the skill distribution and higher residual inequality among immigrants than natives. Even so, immigration accounts for a small share (5%) of the increase in U.S. wage inequality between 1980 and 2000.\\" =Overall benefits and costs= Members of the IGM Economic Experts Panel were asked in December 2013 whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: \\"The average US citizen would be better off if a larger number of low-skilled foreign workers were legally allowed to enter the US each year.\\" Fifty-two percent either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, with 28% uncertain and 9% disagreeing. Regarding a second statement, that low-skilled American workers would be \\"substantially worse off\\" if more low-skilled immigrants were allowed entry, 50% agreed or strongly agreed, with 30% uncertain and 9% disagreeing or strongly disagreeing. In other words, despite an overall benefit for the average American, some low-skilled workers already in the U.S. would probably be adversely impacted by a greater supply of low-skilled labor.IGM Experts Panel-Low Skilled Immigrants-December 10, 2013 Cost-benefit analysis Aviva Chomsky, a professor at Salem State College, states that \\"Early studies in California and in the Southwest and in the Southeast...have come to the same conclusions. Immigrants, legal and illegal, are more likely to pay taxes than they are to use public services. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most public services and live in fear of revealing themselves to government authorities. Households headed by illegal immigrants use less than half the amount of federal services that households headed by documented immigrants or citizens make use of.\\"Chomsky, Aviva. They Take Our Jobs! And Twenty Other Myths about Immigration (2007), 40 National Public Radio (NPR) wrote in 2006: \\"Supporters of a crackdown argue that the U.S. economy would benefit if illegal immigrants were to leave, because U.S. employers would be forced to raise wages to attract American workers. Critics of this approach say the loss of illegal immigrants would stall the U.S. economy, saying illegal workers do many jobs few native-born Americans will do.\\" Professor of Law Francine Lipman writes that the belief that illegal migrants are exploiting the US economy and that they cost more in services than they contribute to the economy is \\"undeniably false\\". Lipman asserts that \\"illegal immigrants actually contribute more to public coffers in taxes than they cost in social services\\" and \\"contribute to the U.S. economy through their investments and consumption of goods and services; filling of millions of essential worker positions resulting in subsidiary job creation, increased productivity and lower costs of goods and services; and unrequited contributions to Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance programs.\\" =Relative contribution by income tax bracket= PEW studies on unauthorized immigrants estimates that the average household of 3.1 persons earns about $36,000 per year. This average wage is consistent with the PEW estimate that 49% of illegal immigrants have not graduated from high school. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that people in this salary bracket (the second quintile) pay about 6.8% of their income in Federal taxes. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household in the bottom quintile received $29,015 in benefits and paid $4,251 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the second quintile the average household received $24,709 in benefits and paid $9,524 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the top quintile, the average household received $21,515 in benefits and services and paid $69,704 in Federal, state and local taxes. However, it is unclear how much benefit the average unauthorized immigrant household is eligible for. =Heritage Foundation Study= In 2013, Robert Rector and Jason Richwine of The Heritage Foundation released a study concluding that as of 2010, the \\"average unlawful immigrant household\\" had a net deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $14,387 per household. Critics of the Rector-Richwine report \\"questioned several assumptions made by the report’s authors—everything from the amount that legalization could boost earnings for immigrants to the amount of welfare they may use.\\" The Heritage report purported to project costs over a 50-year period and assumed no changes to Social Security or Medicare, which prompted criticism that the study was overly speculative. The report also counted \\"the cost of benefits paid to the children of those living in the U.S. illegally, even though many of those children by law are citizens.\\" The methodology and conclusions of the 2013 Heritage Foundation study were sharply criticized as flawed by, among others, Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, Doug Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum, and Tim Kane at the Hudson Institute. Nowrasteh wrote that the Heritage report's refusal to account for GDP growth and increased economic productivity from immigration led to \\"a massive underestimation of the economic benefits of immigration and diminishing estimated tax revenue.\\" Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also criticized the report. =Income Taxes and Eligible for These Tax Credits= Income taxes and eligibility for tax credits are determined based on people’s status of lawful permanent residency. Or else, it is based on the fact, how long anyone has been staying in the United States, despite them being here legally or not. The Congressional Budget Office does not have the estimation of the amount of federal taxes paid by the undocumented people in the country. =Eligibility for Other Benefits= Those people who have the permanent legal status are eligible for most of the government benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, Refundable tax Credits, Unemployment Insurance, and Pell Grants and Student Loans. The undocumented people staying in US, however, are not eligible for these federal programs except for the Child Nutrition Programs. Although few exceptions may apply regarding the Medicare, Social Security, Child Health Insurance Program and Refundable Tax Credits. Karoly and Perez-Arce (2016) did the case study on college tuition and came to the finding of a policy-relevant results. The policy to provide in-state tuition benefits to the undocumented immigrants resulted with direct and secondary economic and fiscal effects. This policy provided incentives to the people born outside of the United States to come to the country to take the advantage of the benefit. This direct cost, in a long run creates more high-skilled workers, who would raise wages, in no time, and tax revenues, improving the overall fiscal picture.

It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley and Toby Jones. story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem, where a boy and a girl from each of the nation's 12 Districts are chosen annually as \\"tributes\\" and forced to compete in The Hunger Games, an elaborate televised fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games. Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force, which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011, with filming taking place in North Carolina. The film was released on March 21, 2012, in some European countries and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012, in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters. Japan received it last, on September 28. When the film was released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel. At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5 million) was the third-largest of any film in North America.Biggest Opening Weekends at the Box Office It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends. The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $694 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and ninth-highest-grossing film of 2012. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 18, 2012. With 7,434,058 units sold, the DVD was the best-selling DVD of 2012. The second installment, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, was released on November 22, 2013, in the United States. The Hunger Games received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its themes and messages, as well as Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss; some criticism was levelled at the film's reliance on shaky cam, especially in the action sequences, and its similarities to other works. The film's soundtrack featured the song \\"Safe & Sound\\", which was sung by American singer Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars; it won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Actress and was also nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Plot Sometime in the future, the world experienced a cataclysmic ecological disaster resulting in rising sea levels, killing most of Earth's population. The former North America remained as the only habitable landmass on the planet, thus forming the nation of Panem. The Capitol (located somewhere in the Rockies) divided Panem into 12 districts under an authoritarian dictatorship. This causes the 12 districts to rebel, which ultimately failed. Throughout the years, as punishment for the failed rebellion, the 12 districts are forced by the Capitol to select two tributes each, one boy and one girl between ages 12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. The mayor's daughter, Madge, gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the Games' only currently living winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \\"Careers\\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine. At the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of tracker jackers, genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee. Rue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest. Haymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. Thresh, District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight. While hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \\"Foxface\\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta. Crane then unleashes genetically modified beasts which kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering. Crane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.

Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller, president and senior vice president of motion picture production at Lionsgate, took charge of overseeing the production of the film, which they described as \\"an incredible property... a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate\\". The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000—one of its largest ever—for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \\"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\\" to help secure the franchise. Lionsgate subsequently acquired tax breaks of $8 million for shooting the film in North Carolina. Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he \\"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\\", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, \\"In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game centre and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was totally important.\\" Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that \\"I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is\\". The Gamemakers' control center, about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, \\"so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\\" Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \\"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that.\\" =Casting= Josh Hutcherson also dyed his hair for the role of Peeta Mellark. Lionsgate confirmed in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chloë Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, Kaya Scodelario and Troian Bellisario. On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence (who was at the time filming for X-Men: First Class) had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having \\"an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that before in my life. It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you.\\" Though Lawrence was 20 when filming began, four years older than the character, Collins said that the role demanded \\"a certain maturity and power\\" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the \\"only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book\\" and that she had \\"every essential quality necessary to play Katniss\\". Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. Contenders for the role of Peeta other than Hutcherson included Alexander Ludwig (who was later cast as Cato), Hunter Parrish, Lucas Till, and Evan Peters. Other actors considered for the role of Gale included David Henrie, Drew Roy, and Robbie Amell. In April 2011, John C. Reilly was in talks with Lionsgate to portray Haymitch Abernathy. The following month Lionsgate announced that the role had gone to Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson. The casting of Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, and Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith, soon followed. Both got the role at the time they were promoting Captain America: The First Avenger. Multiple-Golden Globe Award winner Donald Sutherland was cast as President Coriolanus Snow in late May 2011. =Filming= Bridal Veil Falls in DuPont State Forest. Gary Ross, Sam Mendes, David Slade, Andrew Adamson, Susanna White, Rupert Sanders, and Francis Lawrence were listed as possible directing candidates, but in the end Ross was announced as the film's director in November 2010. Fireman's Fund Insurance Company insured the production, but as part of the underwriting process insisted on a thorough risk analysis of hazards as diverse as wayward arrows, poison ivy, bears, bugs, and a chase across fast-running water.Janet Morrissey (March 24, 2012). \\"Insuring Hollywood Against Falls (but Not Flops)\\" . The New York Times. BU1. Lawrence dyed her blond hair dark for the part of Katniss. She also underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga, and had an accident on the last day of her six-week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Lionsgate hired Olympic bronze medal-winning archer Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot. With an initial budget of $75 million, principal photography began near Brevard in Transylvania County in Western North Carolina in May 2011 and concluded on September 15, 2011, with a final budget reported as between $90 and $100 million, reduced to $78 million after subsidies. Steven Soderbergh served as a second unit director, and filmed much of the District 11 riot scene. The movie was shot on film as opposed to digital due (in part) to the tightness of the schedule; as Ross said in an interview with The New York Times, \\"I didn't want to run the risk of the technical issues that often come with shooting digitally—we simply couldn't afford any delays.\\" Virtually all production photography took place in North Carolina, with Lionsgate receiving tax credits of around $8 million from the state government to do so. It was estimated that the state economy gained up to $60 million from the production, with over 5,000 people employed as extras, crew and support staff. Most outdoor scenes, both from the arena and from the outskirts of District 12, were filmed in DuPont State Forest; the Little River, with its multiple waterfalls, provided several locations for shooting the river running through the arena. To run across Triple Falls, Lawrence was attached to wires and ran on a board. Many of the urban and interior locations, in the Capitol and elsewhere, were filmed in Shelby and Charlotte; other scenes also took place and was filmed in the Asheville area. Ross and production designer Phil Messina drew on the buildings of the 1939 New York World's Fair and symbols of political power including Tiananmen Square and Red Square, when designing the Capitol architecture, which they wanted \\"to be set in the future but have a sense of its own past... it's festive and alluring and indulgent and decadent but it also has to have the kind of might and power behind it\\". For Katniss' neighborhood in District 12, the production team found Henry River Mill Village, an abandoned mill town which Ross said \\"just worked perfectly for the movie to evoke the scene\\"; Messina explained that \\"originally we talked about maybe building one house and the facade of the house next door and redressing it, and maybe doing some CG extensions... we ended up finding a whole abandoned mill town... it was absolutely perfect\\". For the costume design, Judianna Makovsky and her crew looked at a lot of photographs of coal mining districts from the 1950s in the search of a very American feel. The idea was to create clothing unique for every character and to differentiate strongly the people in Capitol and in districts Grey and blue prevailed in the color palette for the district, while the people in Capitol were chosen to look bright in theatrical hats, flowers, ruffles, with powdered and eyebrowless faces. =Music= Soundtrack The soundtrack album for The Hunger Games contains songs inspired by the film; only three of them (\\"Abraham's Daughter\\", \\"Safe & Sound\\", and \\"Kingdom Come\\", respectively) appear in the film itself, during the closing credits. The first single from the film's companion album, \\"Safe & Sound\\" by Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, was released on December 23, 2011. It reached number one on the iTunes overall charts in 12 hours. The music video for \\"Safe & Sound\\" was released on February 13, 2012. Along with separate songs from Swift and The Civil Wars, the soundtrack also features songs by The Decemberists, Arcade Fire, The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies, Neko Case, Kid Cudi Academy Award winner Glen Hansard, The Low Anthem, Punch Brothers, Birdy, Maroon 5, Jayme Dee, and Carolina Chocolate Drops. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012. The soundtrack track list was revealed on iTunes on February 13, 2012, and on the 14th \\"One Engine\\" was released as the second single. Jennifer Lawrence singing \\"Rue's Lullaby\\" was not included on the soundtrack. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, having sold 175,000 copies in its first week. It is one of just 16 soundtracks to grace the top slot in the history of the Top 200 and the first since Michael Jackson's This Is It to debut at #1. Score Lionsgate originally announced that Danny Elfman and T-Bone Burnett would score The Hunger Games, with Burnett also acting as the film's executive music producer to produce songs for the soundtrack. Due to scheduling conflicts, Elfman was replaced by James Newton Howard. The score album was released on March 26, 2012. Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score. The group composed the fascistic-inspired Panem national anthem, entitled \\"Horn of Plenty\\", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. \\"We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,\\" Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. \\"And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically.\\" He further added that \\"it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.\\" Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin, \\"'Horn of Plenty' pulls off the neat feat of sounding both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem. It still has one foot in the band's uncorrupted neighborhoods, but another is up on the podium at the end of Star Wars accepting an Olympic gold medal or something. Horns blare, a choir booms, strings swell, the martial percussion steals the show, and we just realized how much we love Big Brother.\\" The film also features a rather obscure analog track from the 1970s composed by Laurie Spiegel for its \\"cornucopia scene\\", as well as music by Steve Reich, Ólafur Arnalds, and the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble. These do not appear on the soundtrack or score releases. Reception =Critical reception= The Hunger Games received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 84% approval rating, based on 309 reviews, and an average rating of 7.27/10. The site's consensus states, \\"Thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100 score, based on reviews from 49 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A. Many critics praised Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen, as well as most of the main cast. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence embodies Katniss, \\"just as one might imagine her from the novel\\". Empire magazine said \\"Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, there's very little softness about her, more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things.\\" Several critics have reviewed the film favorably and compared it with other young adult fiction adaptations such as Harry Potter and Twilight. Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as \\"[e]xcellent\\" and stated: \\"Move over Harry Potter. A darker, more mature franchise has come to claim your throne.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday referred to The Hunger Games as being \\"darker than 'Harry Potter,' more sophisticated than 'Twilight'.\\" David Sexton of The Evening Standard stated that The Hunger Games \\"is well cast and pretty well acted, certainly when compared with Harry Potter juvenile leads\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the movie as \\"effective entertainment\\" and Lawrence's performance. Despite a largely positive review, he criticized the film for being too long and noted that the film misses opportunities for social criticism. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy gave the film four stars out of five, calling it \\"enthralling from beginning to end, science fiction that has depth and intelligence to match its pulse- racing entertainment value\\". Reynolds also spoke highly of Lawrence's performance and director Gary Ross, whose \\"rough and ready handheld camerawork\\" meant that viewers were \\"with Katniss for every blood-flecked moment of her ordeal in the combat arena\\". However, film critic David Thomson of the magazine The New Republic called it a \\"terrible movie\\", criticizing it for a lack of character development and unclear presentation of the violence, describing the latter as \\"un-American\\". Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the film four out of five stars, stating that director Gary Ross \\"gets the tone of The Hunger Games right. This is a grounded, thoughtful and sometimes quite emotional film, with its dark scenario given due weight. Ross doesn't give the film a glossy, romanticized 'Hollywood' feel, but rather plays everything very realistically and stark, as Katniss must endure these outrageous and horrible scenarios.\\" The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style, but it was said to \\"add to the film in certain ways\\". The violence drew commentary as well. Time critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children, even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel, while critic Théoden Janes of the Charlotte Observer found that \\"[...] the violence is so bland it dilutes the message\\". Also writing in Time, psychologist Christopher J. Ferguson argued that parents' fears of the effect of the film's violent content on their children were unnecessary, and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed. =Box office= The Hunger Games earned $408 million in the US & Canada, and $286.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $694.4 million. It made the largest worldwide opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or the holiday period, earning $211.8 million, which was just ahead of Alice in Wonderland's previous record ($210.1 million). In North America, The Hunger Games is the 22nd-highest-grossing film, the highest- grossing film released outside the summer or holiday period, and the highest- grossing film distributed by Lionsgate. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 50 million tickets in the US. The film set a midnight- gross record for a non-sequel ($19.7 million), which is also the tenth-highest midnight gross overall. On its opening day, it topped the box office at $67.3 million (including midnight showings), setting opening-day and single-day records for a non-sequel. The film also achieved the sixteenth-highest opening-day and nineteenth-highest single-day grosses of all time. For its opening weekend, the movie retained the No. 1 spot and grossed $152.5 million, breaking Alice in Wonderland's opening-weekend records for a film released in March, for any spring release, and for a non-sequel. Its opening weekend gross was the third highest of 2012 behind The Avengers ($207.4 million) and The Dark Knight Rises ($160.8 million) as well as the largest for any film released outside the summer season and the eighth-largest overall. The film held the March and spring opening weekend records for four years until they were broken by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It remained in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avatar to achieve this. On June 10, 2012 (its 80th day in theaters), it became the 14th movie to pass the $400-million-mark. On April 20, 2012, Lionsgate and IMAX Corporation announced that due to \\"overwhelming demand\\", The Hunger Games would return to North American IMAX cinemas on April 27 for a further one-week engagement. Outside North America, the film was released in most countries during March and April 2012, with the exception of China, where it was released in June 2012. On its first weekend ( March 23–25, 2012), the film topped the box office outside North America with $59.25 million from 67 markets, finishing at first place in most of them. The largest opening weekends were recorded in China ($9.6 million), Australia ($9.48 million), and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($7.78 million). In total earnings, its highest-grossing markets after North America are the UK ($37.3 million), Australia ($31.1 million) and China ($27.0 million). With regard to ticket sales, The Hunger Games broke the record for first-day advance ticket sales on Fandango on February 22, 2012, topping the previous record of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. The sales were reported to be 83 percent of the site's totals for the day. According to first tracking, unaided awareness for The Hunger Games was 11%, definite interest was 54%, first choice was 23% and total awareness was 74%. In the week leading up to its release, the film sold-out over 4,300 showings via Fandango and MovieTickets.com On Fandango alone it ranks as the third-highest advance ticket seller ever behind The Twilight Saga: New Moon and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. Finally, according to Fandango it broke the site's single-day sales record (March 23), the mobile sales record for a weekend ( March 23–25, 2012) and the site's highest share of a film's opening weekend (Fandango sold 22% of the film's opening weekend tickets). =Themes= Interpretations of the film's themes and messages have been widely discussed among critics and general commentators. In his review for The Washington Times, Peter Suderman expressed that \\"[m]aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. Maybe it's a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. Maybe it's a feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. Maybe it's a bloody satire of reality television\\", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion. Reviewers and critics have differing views on whether the film represents feminist issues. Historically, among the \\"top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350 million and up), not one has been built around a female action star\\". Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of \\"archetypal figures in the literature of the American West\\" such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" traits equally. Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: \\"Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful—and, I suspect, what makes her so important to a lot of girls and women—is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story.\\" Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of \\"athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting\\" are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless. Mahvesh Murad of The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is \\"a young female protagonist with agency\\", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers. The film has drawn varying interpretations for its political overtones, including arguments in favor of left-wing, right-wing, and libertarian viewpoints. Bob Burnett of The Huffington Post observed the film displays a general distrust of government, regardless of the audience's political party affiliation. Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Dallas Morning News, also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about The Hunger Games as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity. The Huffington Post reported that Penn Badgley, a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, saw the film as a social commentary on the movement. Burnett also states that \\"Collins doesn't use the terms 1 percent and 99 percent, but it's clear that those in the Capitol are members of the 1 percent and everyone in the Panem districts is part of the 99 percent\\". Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning News reported that, among other disparate interpretations, some viewers saw The Hunger Games as a Christian allegory. Jeffrey Weiss of Real Clear Religion, published in the Star Tribune has remarked on what he saw as the intentional absence of religion in The Hunger Games universe, and has commented that while the stories contain no actual religion, people are \\"find[ing] aspects that represent their own religious values\\" within it. =Battle Royale and other precedents= David Sexton of The Evening Standard compared The Hunger Games unfavourably to Kinji Fukasaku's Japanese film Battle Royale, as did several other critics; the novel had earlier faced criticism for its similarities to the novel Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. Jonathan Looms of The Oxford Student argues that it is \\"unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with Battle Royale\\" but that it \\"is a veritable pastiche of other movies\\" as well, comparing it to The Truman Show, Death Race, the Bourne films, and Zoolander, and that it is common for artists to borrow from and \\"improve on many sources. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle.\\" The Hunger Games is considered to be part of a wider battle royale genre, which had earlier been defined by Battle Royale. Prior to The Hunger Games, the battle royale genre was largely limited to Japan, where Battle Royale had inspired a wave of manga, anime and visual novel works, such as Gantz (2000), Higurashi: When They Cry (2002), Future Diary (2006), Btooom! (2009), Zero Escape (2009) and Danganronpa (2010). Wheeler Winston Dixon, a film professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, listed several precedents: Battle Royale, Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Death Race 2000, and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Manohla Dargis in The New York Times compares it to Battle Royale, Ender's Game, and Twilight, but contrasts The Hunger Games in terms of how its \\"exciting\\" female protagonist Katniss \\"rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim\\". Steve Rose of The Guardian refers to the film as \\"think Battle Royale meets The Running Man meets Survivor. Charles McGrath, writing for The New York Times, said that the film will remind viewers of the television series Survivor, a little of The Bachelorette, and of the short story \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson published in 1948 by The New Yorker. It reminded an author at Salon of the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. The Hunger Games has also been conceptually compared to Robert Sheckley's 1953 short story \\"Seventh Victim\\" and its 1965 Italian film adaptation by Elio Petri, The 10th Victim, as the story and film feature a government-endorsed, televised (in the film's case) \\"Big Hunt\\", featuring contestants from around the world acting as \\"hunters\\" and \\"victims\\". Writing in The Atlantic, Govindini Murty made a list of touchstones the film alludes to, from the ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian civilizations to modern references such as the Great Depression, the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and reality television. For her part, author Collins cites the myth of Theseus, reality television and coverage of the Iraq War as her inspiration. =Controversies= During the film's opening weekend, controversial statements about various members of the cast arose, sparking open dialogue about issues of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. Comparisons were also made between The Hunger Games premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, Thresh and Cinna by African American actors. In a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in \\"a time period where hundreds of years have passed\\" and there would be \\"a lot of ethnic mixing\\", she explains \\"there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described\\", and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American. Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online, \\"the racist 'Hunger Games' tweets, because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet, have kicked up a storm\\". Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all reiterate the fact that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins's assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans. Adewunmi remarked that \\"it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: you may be a racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!\\" Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, \\"racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight.\\" Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: \\"As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I want to thank all of my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty.\\" Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying \\"I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet\\" and \\"It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I try not to think about stuff like that.\\" A number of critics expressed disappointment in Lawrence's casting as Katniss because her weight was not representative of a character who has suffered a life of starvation. Manohla Dargis, in her review of the film for The New York Times stated \\"[a] few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that in certain scenes, Lawrence displays \\"lingering baby fat\\". These remarks have been rebuked by a number of journalists for pushing unrealistic body image expectations for women. L.V. Anderson of Slate states that \\"[j]ust as living in a world with abundant calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, I daresay, would be even bigger than Lawrence's.\\" Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist. MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight \\"misguided\\". One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads: \\"I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that \\"[t]he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate\\". The film has been rated 12A by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in the UK for \\"intense threat, moderate violence and occasional gory moments\\". To achieve that rating, Lionsgate had to cut or substitute seven seconds of film by \\"digitally removing blood splashes and the sight of blood on wounds and weapons.\\" The uncut version was ultimately released on Blu-ray in the UK with a 15 certificate. In the United States, the film was granted a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for \\"intense violent thematic material and disturbing images—all involving teens\\"; as Collins had originally anticipated. Screening of The Hunger Games was delayed indefinitely in Vietnam. The film was to be released on March 30, 2012, but, according to a member of the Vietnamese National Film Board, the Board considers the film to be too violent and unanimously voted for the indefinite delay. It was later banned. =Accolades= Home media The film was released in North America and the Netherlands on DVD and Blu-ray Disc August 18, 2012, and in the rest of Europe on September 3, 2012. Extras include The World is Watching: Making The Hunger Games, numerous featurettes, the propaganda video in its entire form, a talk with the director Gary Ross and also Elvis Mitchell and a marketing archive. In its first weekend on sale, Lionsgate reported that 3.8 million DVD/Blu-ray Disc copies of the movie were sold, with more than one- third in the Blu-ray Disc format. Three weeks after the release of the movie to home media formats in the US, over 5 million DVD units and 3.7 million Blu- ray Disc units have been sold. With 10,336,637 sold, it became the top-selling video of 2012. The entire Hunger Games series was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on November 8, 2016. Sequels On August 8, 2011, while still shooting the film, Lionsgate announced that a film adaptation of the second novel in The Hunger Games trilogy, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, was scheduled to be released on November 22, 2013. In November 2011, Lionsgate entered negotiations with screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to adapt the novel for screen, since the post-production schedule for The Hunger Games was too crowded for Ross and Collins to adapt the next film as originally planned. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began production in the summer of 2012. Gary Ross did not return for Catching Fire, and instead Francis Lawrence directed the film.\\"Director Francis Lawrence Chosen For ‘Catching Fire’ Sequel To ‘Hunger Games’\\" . Deadline Hollywood. Retrieved April 28, 2012. On May 6, 2012, it was reported that Michael Arndt was in talks to re-write the script for Catching Fire. Arndt officially signed on as the new script writer on May 24, 2012. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began filming September 10, 2012, and concluded December 21, 2012; it premiered in London on November 11, 2013, before premiering on November 22, 2013 in the US as was originally scheduled. In July 2012, release dates were confirmed for two films based on the last book Mockingjay. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 was released November 21, 2014, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 was released November 20, 2015.

In 1882, the family moved to Drammen, where Bernhard grew up in the borough of Strømsø. After graduating at Drammen Latin School in 1896, he started as an apprentice in decoration discipline in Christiania (now Oslo) before he went to Copenhagen in 1902. Here he spent a time with Kristian Zahrtmann.

Folkestad debuted in 1905 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo with a painting which was purchased for the National Gallery. Folkestad went on a study trip to Lübeck , Hamburg and Amsterdam during 1907. In 1909, Folkestad was in Paris at Académie Colarossi with Christian Krogh. From 1910-1911, he was in Berlin, returning in 1913 to Paris. In 1916, the family moved to Oslo. About the same time, he bought a cottage on Brøtsøy in Tjøme where he built a studio. Starting in 1921, Folkestad first published an essay. Subsequently writing took more time away from his easel.

Levasseur (or Le Vasseur), known in her day as Mademoiselle Rosalie,Not to be confused with another \\"Mlle Rosalie\\" (whose complete name was Rosalie de Saint-Évreux) who was active in much the same period at the Comédie Italienne as an opéra-comique soprano. and later commonly referred to as Rosalie Levasseur (8 October 1749 - 6 May 1826) was a French soprano who is best remembered for her work with the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck. Biography Born in Valenciennes in 1749, she first appeared at the Paris Opéra in a revival of Campra's L'Europe galante in 1766. After an undistinguished beginning to her career, when she appeared only in minor roles, such as Cupid in Berton and Trial's, Théonis (1767), and La Borde's Ismène et Isménias, (1770) her status in the company rapidly improved following Gluck's arrival in Paris in 1774. The new maestro and the primadonna in office, Sophie Arnould, could not stand each other,To Mlle Arnould who insisted upon new great arias to sing in Iphigénie en Aulide instead of perpetual recitative, cantankerous Gluck is reported to have once replied that, first of all, one was supposed to be able to sing (Antonia Fraser, Maria Antonietta. La solitudine di una regina, Milan, Mondadori, 2004, p. 130, ). while Levasseur was the mistress of the Austrian ambassador and Gluck's countryman Florimond de Mercy-Argenteau, who exerted moreover a strong influence on the Dauphine Marie Antoinette, herself a former singing pupil of the German Kapellmeister.. Marie Antoinette ascended the throne, as the Queen consort, in May 1774 upon her grandfather-in-law Louis XV's death, which caused the French theatres to be closed and the first run of Iphigénie en Aulide to be interrupted after its fourth performance. At first 'Mlle Rosalie' was given again an insignificant role (a Greek woman) at the premiere of Iphigénie en Aulide in April, but four months later she performed the much more important part of Cupid in Orphée et Eurydice, being endowed with a second additional aria. The following year she took over from Arnould the leading roles of Iphigénie and Eurydice in the new version of the former opera and in the revivals of the latter, after which she was promoted to the company's top soprano being entrusted with the creation of the title roles in the subsequent main operas by Gluck, Alceste on 23 April 1776, Armide on 23 September 1777, and Iphigénie en Tauride on 18 May 1779. She also appeared in operas by Gluck's rival Niccolò Piccinni, as well as Johann Christian Bach, André Grétry, and Antonio Sacchini. In 1783 she handed over to Antoinette Saint-Huberty the role of Armide in Sacchini's Renaud after its third performance, and she is not known to have tried to resume her leading position at the Paris Opera thereafter, just making rarer and rarer appearances in revivals. In June 1784, she performed one last time at Court in the gala entertainment in honour of the King of Sweden, Gustav III, and retired officially in 1785. Julian Rushton describes Levasseur as a \\"powerful rather than flexible singer, with a good stage presence if unattractive features.\\" She died in Neuwied am Rhein in 1826.

It is based on a novel by Blai Bonet. The plot, set in Mallorca, follows the fates of three childhood friends traumatized by the violence they witnessed during the Spanish Civil War. Ten years later, they are reunited as young adults in a sanatorium for TB patients. The film won the Manfred Salzgeber Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Plot In the summer of 1936, the violence of the Spanish Civil war reaches a small village in Mallorca. Four children: Andreu Ramallo, Manuel Tur, Pau Inglada and a girl, Francisca, are witness to the execution of leftists at the hands of pro-Franco villagers. In a desperate act of revenge, Pau, whose father has been killed the previous day by the lead executioner, plans to avenge his father's murder torturing Julià Ballester, the son of his father's killer. His idea is to force the boy to drink castor oil. However, things go wrong when the boy, Julià Ballester, taunts them and Pau becomes enraged. He brutally kills Julià by bashing his head against a rock and then stabbing him in the throat. Unable to deal with what he has just done, Pau commits suicide jumping inside a hole on a cave. The remaining children: Andreu, Manuel, and Francisa are witnesses to these tragic events. Over a decade later, Ramallo, now a cocky young man, is sent to a tuberculosis sanatorium on Mallorca to recuperate from the initial stages of the disease. Ramallo, like all the tubercular and lung diseased patients, has to live in a large room, dormitory style. However, as a patient's health dwindles and they are expected to die, they are sent to a private room numbered 13 for their final days. Ramallo with his boastfulness and stories of sexual prowess attracts the admiration of the other patients, particularly from Galindo, the youngest of the group. Ramallo is shocked to find that Manuel Tur, his childhood friend, is also a patient. A pale and drawn man, Manuel has found solace to his health predicament in religion. Even more shocking is the sight of the beautiful Francisca, now a selfless nun, nursing the sick at the hospital. Alcantara, the brutal caretaker and Carmen, his unhappy wife, run the place. Shortly after his arrival, Ramallo receives the unwanted visit of Don Eugeni Morell, his former boss, in smuggling contraband. The well-to-do middle age Morel, has also sexually exploited him for long time. Morell's visit makes Ramallo furious and from then on, he tries to disassociate himself from the crime lord. As a reminder than he can count only on himself, Ramallo gets his own name tattooed on his chest by Alcántara, the hospital's maintenance guy. In the clinic, Manuel has a pet cat that he dotes on. In a fit of anger Ramallo kicks the cat almost to death. Manuel gives the dying animal back to Ramallo to put it out of its misery. They bury the animal together and reconcile remembering their childhood friendship. Ramallo wants to get rid of Morell for good, but his first attempt to steal some money from the church of the sanatorium fails when he is discovered by Francisca. As a child, Francisca had a crush on Ramallo and now she is glad to see him again, but she assures him that she is perfectly happy in her life as a nun. Ramallo starts scheming to hijack smuggling goods from Morell. He recruits Manuel in helping him to steal the keys of Alcántara's car in order to go to the nearby port. In the middle of this dealing, Galindo's death affects Ramallo deeply. Carmen has a soft spot for Manuel and seduces him. At first, Manuel tries to resist the temptation because she is a married woman, but she assures him that she is unhappy in her marriage and only feels disgust for her husband. They have sex, but when Manuel finds out that she came to visit him on Ramallo's suggestion, he tells her to leave him alone. Manuel angrily confronts Ramallo accusing him of being jealous of his purity. Ramallo leaves him silent telling him that his anger comes because he is secretly in love with him. In fact, attracted to his friend, Manuel steals Ramallo's clothes but, in his morbid religious fervor, fights his desires that he believes are diabolical. Manuel's sexual panic turns into self-inflicted stigmata. Francisca accidentally discovers Ramallo's schemes but does not turn him in, instead she travels with Manuel to the cave in which Pau committed suicide in order to recover from it the items Ramallo stole from Morell. Ramallo escapes the sanatorium and returns to Morell's home. When Morell tells him that Manuel betrayed him, giving away the location of his purloined goods, Ramallo murders Morell with an axe. Ramallo returns to the sanatorium to take revenge on Manuel. Manuel tells Ramallo that he loves him and that he gave the goods to Morell to fight his attraction for him. Ramallo begins to rape him, claiming that the pleasure will get Manuel torture for the rest of his life. Manuel plunges a knife into Ramallo's throat before slitting his own wrist. Francisca lays out the two bodies in the mortuary and removes her nun's coif.

The novels have all been developed into films starring Jennifer Lawrence, with the film adaptation of Mockingjay split into two parts. The first two books in the series were both New York Times best sellers, and Mockingjay topped all US bestseller lists upon its release.

The Hunger Games universe is a dystopia set in Panem, a North American country consisting of the wealthy Capitol and 13 districts in varying states of poverty. Every year, children from the first 12 districts are selected via lottery to participate in a compulsory televised battle royale death match called The Hunger Games. The novels were all well received. In August 2012, the series ranked second, exceeded only by the Harry Potter series in NPR's poll of the top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young adult books. On August 17, 2012, Amazon announced The Hunger Games trilogy as its top seller, surpassing the record previously held by the Harry Potter series. , the trilogy has sold more than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone (more than 28 million copies of The Hunger Games, more than 19 million copies of Catching Fire, and more than 18 million copies of Mockingjay). The Hunger Games trilogy has been sold into 56 territories in 51 languages to date. A prequel novel, titled The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, about the early days of Panem and The Hunger Games was released on May 19, 2020. Setting The Hunger Games trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, located in North America. The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in Appalachia, where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the \\"Dark Days\\"), in which District 13 was destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called \\"tributes\\", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his/her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and lack of remorse, forgetfulness, and forgiveness for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors. =Structure= Each book in The Hunger Games trilogy has three sections of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which taught her to write in a three-act structure; her previous series, The Underland Chronicles, was written in the same way. She sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions \\"act breaks\\". =Origins= Collins says she drew inspiration for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of inspiration is the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, in which, as a punishment for past crimes, Minos forces Athens to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast labyrinth. Collins says that even as a child, she was stunned by the idea since \\"it was just so cruel\\" to force Athens to sacrifice its own children. Collins also cites as a classical inspiration the Roman gladiator games. She feels three key elements create a good game: an all powerful and ruthless government, people forced to fight to the death, and the game's role as a source of popular entertainment. A contemporary source of inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with reality television programs. She says they are like The Hunger Games because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel- surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq War. She described how the two combined in an \\"unsettling way\\" to create her first ideas for the series. Novels =Trilogy= The Hunger Games The Hunger Games is the first book in the series and was released on September 14, 2008. The Hunger Games follows 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her younger sister Primrose Everdeen. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta Mellark. They are mentored by their district's only living victor, Haymitch Abernathy, who won 24 years earlier and has since led a solitary life of alcoholism. Peeta confesses his longtime secret love for Katniss in a televised interview prior to the Games. This revelation stuns Katniss, who harbors feelings for Gale Hawthorne, her friend and hunting partner. Haymitch advises her to feign feelings for Peeta in order to gain wealthy sponsors who can provide crucial supplies to the \\"star-crossed lovers\\" during the Games. In the arena, Katniss allies with Rue, a young tribute from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her kid sister. When Rue is killed, Katniss places flowers around her body as an act of defiance toward the Capitol. Then the remaining tributes are alerted to a rule change that allows tributes from the same district to win as a team. Katniss finds a seriously wounded Peeta and nurses him back to health. When all of the other tributes are dead, the rule change is abruptly revoked. With neither willing to kill the other, Katniss comes up with a solution: a double suicide by eating poisonous berries. This forces the authorities to concede just in time to save their lives. During and after the Games, Katniss develops genuine feelings for Peeta and struggles to reconcile them with what she feels for Gale. Haymitch warns her that the danger is far from over. The authorities are furious at being made fools of, and the only way to try to allay their anger is to pretend that her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception. Catching Fire  Catching Fire is the second installment in the series, released on September 1, 2009. In Catching Fire, which begins six months after the conclusion of The Hunger Games, Katniss learns that her defiance in the previous novel has started a chain reaction that has inspired rebellion in the districts. President Snow threatens to harm Katniss' family and friends if she does not help to defuse the unrest in the districts and marry Peeta. Meanwhile, Peeta has become aware of Katniss' disingenuous love for him, but he has also been informed of Snow's threats, so he promises to help keep up the act to spare the citizens of District 12. Katniss and Peeta tour the districts as victors and plan a public wedding. While they follow Snow's orders and keep up the ruse, Katniss inadvertently fuels the rebellion, and the mockingjay pin she wears becomes its symbol. District by district, the citizens of Panem begin to stage uprisings against the Capitol. Snow announces a special 75th edition of the Hunger Games—known as the Quarter Quell—in which Katniss and Peeta are forced to compete with other past victors, effectively canceling the wedding. At Haymitch's urging, the pair teams up with several other tributes, and manages to destroy the arena and escape the Games. Katniss is rescued by the rebel forces from District 13, and Gale informs her that the Capitol has destroyed District 12, and captured both Peeta and their District 7 ally, Johanna Mason. Katniss ultimately learns—to her surprise—that she had inadvertently been an integral part of the rebellion all along; her rescue had been jointly planned by Haymitch, Plutarch Heavensbee, and Finnick Odair, among others. After some hesitation Katniss joins the rebels. Mockingjay Mockingjay, the third and final book in The Hunger Games series, was released on August 24, 2010. Most of the districts have rebelled against the Capitol, led by District 13 and its President Alma Coin. The Capitol lied about the district being destroyed in the Dark Days. After a Mexican standoff with the Capitol, the District 13 residents took to living underground and rebuilding their strength. The District 12 survivors find shelter with them. Katniss, after seeing first-hand the destruction wrought on her district, agrees to become the \\"Mockingjay\\", the symbol of the rebellion. She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, Annie Cresta, and Enobaria, fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor. For her sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie. However, Peeta has been brainwashed to kill Katniss, and he tries to choke her to death upon their reunion. He undergoes experimental treatment to try to cure him. After she recovers, Katniss and a team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta, Finnick, a camera crew, and various other soldiers, are assigned to film propaganda in relatively quiet combat zones. Katniss, however, decides to go to the Capitol to kill Snow, pretending that Coin gave her that mission. Most of the squad are killed along the way, including recently married Finnick. As Katniss approaches Snow's mansion, she sees a group of Capitol children surrounding it as human shields. Suddenly a hovercraft drops silver parachutes on the children, who reach for them, hoping they bear food. Some of the parachutes explode, creating carnage. The advancing rebels send in medics, including Prim. Then the rest of the parachutes blow up, killing Prim, just as she spots her sister. Later, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a coma to learn that the rebels have won, and Snow is awaiting execution at her hands. When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high- ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies. Katniss is tried, but the jury believes she was mentally unfit, and she is sent home to District 12. Both Katniss' mother and Gale take jobs in other districts. Peeta regains his sanity. Katniss settles down with him, and after many years of persuasion by him, she finally agrees to have children. They have a girl and then a boy. =Prequel= The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes Set 64 years before The Hunger Games events, it tells the story of the 'Dark Days' which led to the failed rebellion in Panem. Collins stated that the book would explore the 10 years after the end of the war where the people of Panem try to get back on their feet and figure out how to go on within their new reality. The book was released on May 19, 2020. Themes Major themes of the novels include distrust of authority (of adults and the government), and feminism. Social inequality, unaccountable governance and violence against children have also been suggested as prominent themes. \\"In the world of the 'Hunger Games', the Capitol lives a life of extravagant wealth and consumption. Meanwhile, out in the 'districts', millions of people work dangerous jobs with low pay. As the Capitol wallows in excess, the districts can barely afford to feed their children.\\" Author Suzanne Collins also mentions the themes of \\"just war\\", gladiatorial combat and hunger. War as a result of climate disaster, and the power and illusions of television have also been cited as themes. Others have mentioned revolution and rebellion as themes. \\"Although it’s... aimed at young adults, it presents potentially quite subversive ideas of mass revolution, economic sabotage and the populist fight against oligarchy.\\" Popular culture =Critical reception= All three books have been favorably received. Praise has focused on the addictive quality, especially of the first book, and the action. John Green of The New York Times compared The Hunger Games with Scott Westerfeld's The Uglies series. Catching Fire was praised for improving upon the first book. Mockingjay was praised for its portrayal of violence, world building, and romantic intrigue. The series received criticism regarding its reality TV \\"death game\\" theme being derivative of earlier works, particularly Battle Royale, as well as The Running Man, The Long Walk, The 10th Victim, and Series 7: The Contenders. The series was also criticized for the romantic plotline: Rollie Welch of Ohio's The Plain Dealer criticized the characters' lack of resolute behavior, and Jennifer Reese of Entertainment Weekly stated that there was little distinction between Peeta and Gale and the series lacked the \\"erotic energy\\" seen in the Twilight series. J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters stated, \\"While the film saga does capture the action of The Hunger Games, the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves.\\" In his review Mike Ruiz argues that The Hunger Games film does not have the first-person narrative that is in the original novel. As a result, Ruiz contends the novel is better than the film. The last book, Mockingjay, was criticized by Dan Shade of SF Site, who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.Shade, Dan (2010). \\"Mockingjay\\". SF Site. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed The Hunger Games on its list of the 100 most influential novels. =Adaptations= ;Film adaptations Lionsgate Entertainment acquired worldwide distribution rights to a film adaptation of The Hunger Games, produced by Nina Jacobson's Color Force production company. Collins adapted the novel for film herself, along with director Gary Ross. The cast included Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Lionsgate announced that the trilogy will be made into 4 movies. The first film began production in Spring 2011, and was released in March 2012. For Catching Fire, Ross was replaced as director by Francis Lawrence; the film was released in November 2013. Lawrence then directed Mockingjay, parts 1 and 2, released in November 2014 and November 2015. There is a film version of the prequel that is in progress with Francis Lawrence as the director. =Culture= ;Influence in Thailand A gesture (a raised up hand with three middle fingers pressed together) used in The Hunger Games trilogy to express unity with people striving to survive, was used in 2014 by anti- government protestors in Thailand, at least seven of whom were arrested for it. It was later used in 2020 Thai protests.

Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882), is a 5-to-4 ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that the Constitution's prohibition on lawsuits against the federal government did not extend to officers of the government themselves. The case involved the heir of Mary Anna Custis Lee, wife of Confederate States of America General Robert E. Lee, who sued to regain control of Arlington House and its grounds. Arlington had been seized by the United States government in 1861 and eventually converted into Arlington National Cemetery. The estate had been sold to pay outstanding taxes, but the lawsuit contested the tax sale as improper. A jury found in favor of the Lees.Chase, 1930, p. 191. The Supreme Court, too, concluded that the tax sale was illegal.Meyer, 1998, p. 140.Amar, 1987, p. 1512.On this point, the Court was unanimous. See: Grant, 1996, p. 203, note 254. In stripping the federal officers of their sovereign immunity, the Supreme Court agreed that suit against them was proper.Jackson, 1969, p. 96; Stephenson, 2003, p. 74. The jury verdict returned Arlington to the Lee family, but only temporarily. The family never returned to Arlington, but rather sold the estate to the United States government in 1883 for $150,000 ($ in dollars).Holt, 2010, p. 336. Background =History of the Arlington estate= John Parke Custis, son of Martha Washington and stepson of George Washington, purchased of forest and farm land in 1778 and called it \\"Arlington.\\"Silber, 2003, p. 125.\\"Arlington National Cemetery,\\" 2009, p. 77. The estate was located directly across the Potomac River from the future site of Washington, D.C., in what was then Alexandria County (now known as Arlington County). John Custis died in 1781, and his son, George Washington Parke Custis, inherited the property. G.W.P. Custis hired George Hadfield, then supervising construction of the United States Capitol, to design and build a two-story Greek Revival house atop the most prominent hill on the property, a mansion Custis named \\"Arlington House.\\" G.W.P. Custis' daughter, Mary Anna, married Robert E. Lee in 1831. Custis died in 1857, leaving his estate and Arlington House to his daughter.Silber, 2003, p. 126. =Seizure of the estate= In April 1861, Virginia seceded from the United States and Robert E. Lee resigned his commission in the United States Army on April 20, 1861, and joined the military forces of the Confederate States of America. On May 7, troops of the Virginia militia occupied Arlington and Arlington House.Hansen, 2001, p. 69. With Confederate forces occupying Arlington's high ground, the capital of the Union was left in an untenable military position.Chase, 1930, p. 173. Although unwilling to leave Arlington House, Mary Lee believed her estate would soon be invested with federal soldiers. So she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sister's estate at Ravensworth in Fairfax County, Virginia, on May 14.McCaslin, 2004, p. 79-80.Atkinson, 2007, p. 25. On May 3, General Winfield Scott ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to clear Arlington and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, of all troops not loyal to the United States.Chase, 1930, p. 175-176. McDowell occupied Arlington without opposition on May 24.Chase, 1930, p. 176. Union troops pose in front of Arlington House during the American Civil War. On June 7, 1862, the U.S. Congress enacted the Act for the Collection of Taxes in the Insurrectionary Districts (12 Stat. at L. 422), legislation which imposed a property tax on all land in \\"insurrectionary\\" areas of the United States.\\"Arlington,\\" 2000, p. 77. The 1863 amendments to the statute required these taxes to be paid in person.Poole, 2009, p. 54-55. Congress knew that few Confederate sympathizers would appear in person to pay the tax, thus allowing the federal government to seize large amounts of property and auction it off to raise money for the war effort. A tax of $92.07 ($ in dollars) was levied on the Arlington estate in 1863. But Mary Lee, afflicted with severe rheumatoid arthritis and behind Confederate lines in Richmond, Virginia, gave the payment to her cousin, Philip R. Fendall (who lived in Alexandria). The tax collectors refused to accept his payment.Poole, 2009, p. 55. On January 11, 1864, the entire estate was auctioned off to pay the tax due. (With a 50 percent penalty for nonpayment, the total of tax and fine was $138.11 ($ in dollars).)Chase, 1930, p. 180. Although the auction was well-attended, the U.S. government was the only bidder and won the property for $26,800 ($ in dollars) (less than its assessed value of $34,100 ($ in dollars)). With local cemeteries in Alexandria County and Alexandria filling rapidly with war dead, Quartermaster General of the United States Army Montgomery C. Meigs proposed using of the Arlington estate as a cemetery. The first burial there was made on May 13, 1864. United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton approved the establishment of a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, creating Arlington National Cemetery.McCaslin, 2004, p. 82. By the end of the war in April 1865, more than 16,000 people had been buried at Arlington. In September 1866, a memorial and a burial vault (containing the remains of 2,111 U.S. and Confederate soldiers who died at the First Battle of Bull Run, Second Battle of Bull Run, and along the Rappahannock River) were buried in Lee's former wildflower garden on the mansion's east side beneath the Civil War Unknowns Monument, a memorial to honor unknown soldiers who had died during the American Civil War.Atkinson, 2007, p. 26. =Suit by Lee's heirs= Robert E. Lee made no attempt to restore his title to Arlington before his death in 1870. Mary Lee died in 1873, having returned to the house a few months before her death. Too upset at its condition, she refused to enter and left after just a few moments. In April 1874,Chase, 1930, p. 182. Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress for payment for the Arlington estate.Randall, 1913, p. 35. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire property (rather than just that portion needed to pay the tax debt) amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept payment made the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted that the federal government should only be able to secure a life interest in the property (in other words, seize it only as long as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on. George Washington Custis Lee in 1865, in his Confederate general's uniform. In April 1877, Lee filed suit in Alexandria County circuit court to eject the U.S. government from Arlington.Chase, 1930, p. 183. His suit named, among others, Frederick Kaufman (a civilian in the United States Department of War who oversaw Arlington National Cemetery) and R.P. Strong (a U.S. Army officer who supervised the portion of Arlington which had become an Army post).Chase, 1930, p. 183-184. Almost a thousand others were named in the suit, all of them former African American slaves who had been allowed to form a settlement known as Freedmen's Village on part of the estate.Chase, 1930, p. 184. On July 6, United States Attorney General Charles Devens filed a writ of certiorari asking that the case be transferred to the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a request which the federal court approved three days later. On July 16, Devens filed a motion to have Lee's suit dismissed on the grounds that the Constitution made the federal government immune to suits at law (unless it gave its consent).Chase, 1930, p. 184-185. Lee filed a demurrer, pointing out that the government had taken the contradictory position of being a private buyer in a tax sale and yet asserting sovereign immunity as if its purchase were a governmental act.Chase, 1930, p. 185. On March 15, 1878, the circuit court held that not only did the court have jurisdiction to decide the issue but that the lawsuit presented a controversy over facts which should be decided by a jury.Chase, 1930, p. 187-188. A jury trial was held January 24–30, 1879, in Alexandria.Chase, 1930, p. 189. The jury found for Lee, concluding that the demand to accept payment only in person violated the Constitution's due process guarantees. The federal government asked on April 6, 1879, that the jury verdict be set aside on the basis of the Supreme Court's ruling in Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, (a decision handed down on March 3, after the jury's verdict had been reached). Carr v. United States involved a case where the city of San Francisco, California, transferred title to property within the city to the federal government even though a private citizen claimed title to the land. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Carr that the federal government cannot be sued without its consent, that a suit against an officer or agent of the federal government does not bind the government itself, and that courts do not have jurisdiction over title suits against the federal government's officers and agents.Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433. Only when property has been transferred by the courts does a private citizen establish a right to establish or reclaim rights to title. But the circuit court in Lee held that much of the decision in Carr was dicta, and reaffirmed the jury decision.Chase, 1930, p. 192. Two appeals were made to the U.S. Supreme Court. The first was by the United States government itself, while the second was made by the government on behalf of Kaufman and Strong.Chase, 1930, p. 193. The question was whether the title actually transferred to the federal government. If yes, then Lee had no claim; but if not, then Lee had standing to sue to reclaim his title to the land. To determine this, the Supreme Court first had to rule out all other grounds for a suit, and then determine whether the tax sale actually transferred the title.Chase, 1930, p. 193-194.  Opinion of the Court  Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller wrote the decision for the majority, joined by Associate Justices Stephen Johnson Field, John Marshall Harlan, Stanley Matthews, and Samuel Blatchford. Most of Miller's ruling was technical.Randall, 1913, p. 36. After reviewing the facts of the case,United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 196-199. Miller presented the two critical questions in the case: 1) Were there other grounds for a suit other than transfer of title in error, and 2) whether the tax sale had actually transferred title.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 199. The members of the Court were agreed that there no errors regarding interpretation of the law by the circuit court, in the jury instructions, or in the documents of the tax sale.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 199-200. But, citing Bennett v. Hunter, 72 U.S. 326 (1869), (which had involved the nearby Abingdon estate); Tacey v. Irwin, 85 U.S. 549 (1873); and Atwood v. Weems, 99 U.S. 183 (1878), the majority reaffirmed that a tax collector's refusal to accept payment was the equivalent of payment.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 200. The majority considered whether a rule had been properly adopted by the tax commissioners to accept payment only from the title holder him or her self, and found that it had properly been adopted.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 200-202. However, the majority found that denial of a taxpayer's right to pay through an agent was improper:United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 202, citing Hills v. Exchange Bank, 105 U.S. 319 (1881). :...[T]he commissioners, having in the execution of the law acted upon a rule which deprived the owner of the land of an important right, a right which went to the root of the matter, a right which has in no instance known to us or cited by counsel been refused to a tax-payer, the sale made under such circumstances is invalid, as much so as if the tax had been actually paid or tendered. The government claimed that prior Court rulings on tax payment regulations were not applicable because the 1862 the law specifically required payment to be made in person, but the Court disagreed and distinguished its previous decisions as being based on the 1862 law and its 1863 amendments.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 202-203. The government also claimed that the law did not permit payment to be made between the announcement of the tax sale and the date of the sale if the government were the purchaser.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 203. But the majority pointed out that this created a contradiction: How could the title holder know that the government was the purchaser until the actual purchase had occurred? This made no sense, and subsequently that section of the law was invalid. Justice Samuel Miller, who wrote the majority opinion in Lee. The Court next considered whether payment had been attempted. Relying on Cooley v. O'Connor, 79 U.S. 391 (1870), the majority noted that nothing in the law or the Constitution indicated that the government's title to land \\"should have any greater effect as evidence of title than in the case of a private purchaser, nor why it should not be subject to the same rules in determining its validity, nor why the payment or tender of the tax, interest, and costs, should not be made by an agent in the one case as in the other.\\"United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 204. Since there was uncontested evidence that Lee had attempted to make payment in full, the tax should have been considered paid. But did sovereign immunity bar any challenge to the government's title, once title had been transferred? Justice Miller engaged in a lengthy historical review of the privilege of sovereign immunity, its roots in English and common law, its acceptance in Colonial America, its enshrinement in the Constitution, and its growing acceptance by the courts of the United States.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 205-210. But the Lee lawsuit was against Kaufman and Strong as individuals, not just the United States government. The government argued that title in the Arlington estate was held by the government, not these officers, and thus was immunized against suit.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 110. The Court, citing Meigs v. M'Clung's Lessee 13 U.S. 11 (1815), concluded there was no difference whether the officers were in possession of the land themselves or whether they held the land as agents of the government.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 210-211. The Court relied heavily on Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), in which officers of the state of Ohio (rather than the state itself) were sued but the actual party affected was the sovereignly immune state.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 212-213. The majority reaffirmed the statement of principle in Davis v. Gray: \\"Where the State is concerned, the State should be made a party, if it can be done.\\"United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 215, citing Davis v. Gray, 83 U. S. 203 (1872) at 221. The Court agreed that much of the holding in Carr v. United States was dicta, and could not be relied upon by the government.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 216-217. The government also claimed that since Arlington had been put to a lofty public use (a cemetery and a fort), Lee should not be able to disturb title to it after so long a period of time. But the Court strongly disagreed, arguing that the Fifth Amendment made no such distinction.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 217-220. In ringing language, the majority upheld Lee's right against deprivation of property without due process of law:United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220-221. :The defence stands here solely upon the absolute immunity from judicial inquiry of every one who asserts authority from the executive branch of the government, however clear it may be made that the executive possessed no such power. Not only no such power is given, but it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the legislative, to deprive any one of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compensation. ... No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives. Courts of justice are established, not only to decide upon the controverted rights of the citizens as against each other, but also upon rights in controversy between them and the government; and the docket of this court is crowded with controversies of the latter class. Shall it be said, in the face of all this, and of the acknowledged right of the judiciary to decide in proper cases, statutes which have been passed by both branches of Congress and approved by the President to be unconstitutional, that the courts cannot give a remedy when the citizen has been deprived of his property by force, his estate seized and converted to the use of the government without lawful authority, without process of law, and without compensation, because the President has ordered it and his officers are in possession? If such be the law of this country, it sanctions a tyranny which has no existence in the monarchies of Europe, nor in any other government which has a just claim to well-regulated liberty and the protection of personal rights. The decision of the circuit court was affirmed.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 223. = Dissent = Associate Justice Horace Gray wrote a dissent, which was joined by Chief Justice Morrison Waite and Associate Justices Joseph P. Bradley, and William Burnham Woods. Justice Gray extensively reviewed the facts of the case.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 224-226. Then Gray asserted the critical principle in the case: \\"The sovereign is not liable to be sued in any judicial tribunal without its consent. The sovereign cannot hold property except by agents.\\"United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 226. Like the majority, the dissenters also provided a lengthy history of the right of sovereign immunity, but underscoring the uniform inviolability of the right.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 226-239. Citing United States v. Clarke, 33 U.S. 436 (1834), the dissent reasserted that a lawsuit against the United States must be brought under the explicit authority of an act of Congress or the courts have no jurisdiction over it.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 239. Gray also reviewed the authority of private citizens to bring suit in the United States Court of Claims.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 239-241. To permit Lee's suit, Gray argued, would open the United States to a multitude of suits over title to land it held.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 242. The cases cited by the majority (such as United States v. Peters, Osborn v. Bank of United States, Meigs v. M'Clung, and Davis v. Gray) were improperly cited, Gray argued, as in each case \\"either the money was in the personal possession of the defendants and not in the possession of the State, or the suit was to restrain the defendants by injunction from doing acts in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\\"United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 242-243. It was one thing for the Court to eject or dispossess officers or agents of the United States from land or funds; such actions, Gray concluded, continued to immunize the United States government from suits.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 244-248. Carr v. United States reaffirmed this principle, he concluded.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 248. To blur the distinction between officer and state or to assume or imply it without the state's consent, as the majority does, Gray said, would leave the sovereign immunity right in shambles.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 249. Once the United States asserted that it was a party to the case, Gray concluded, the courts had no jurisdiction and should not have heard the case.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 249-251. Once the United States interposed itself between Kaufman and Strong and the plaintiff, the courts should not have ordered trial to proceed against them, either.United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 251. Because the courts had no jurisdiction, the dissenters refused to address the issue of the validity of the title.  Subsequent developments  Arlington House at Arlington National Cemetery in 2005. The U.S. government faced the daunting prospect of having to disinter 17,000 bodies and transfer Arlington back to the Lee family. Additionally, much of the estate had been developed into the new Army post of Fort Myer. After several months of difficult negotiations, Lee and the government settled on a sale price of $150,000 ($ in dollars). Congress enacted legislation funding the purchase on March 3, 1883; Lee signed over the title on March 31; and the title transfer was recorded on May 14, 1883. United States v. Lee is one of three important federal sovereign immunity cases, and the most important doctrinally.Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 80; Jaffee, 1963, p. 25. The case showed just how sharply divided the Supreme Court was over the scope and legitimacy of sovereign immunity in the United States.Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 81. The majority opinion questioned whether sovereign immunity was appropriate in a republic, and suggested that it had been adopted in an unprincipled and careless way by previous court decisions. The decision was the first to refuse to extend sovereign immunity to officers of the state acting as individuals,Durchslag, 2002, p. 53. a principle which would later become known as the \\"stripping doctrine\\".Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 81-82. The decision also revised the Supreme Court's \\"nominal party rule,\\" first enunciated in Osborn and Davis. In those cases, the Court had salvaged federal and state sovereign immunity by creating a bright-line legal fiction that the suits were against government officers in their capacity as individuals and not acting on behalf of the state. The Court in Lee reaffirmed this \\"nominal party rule\\" but only with five votes—which proved to be the last time it was invoked.Jacobs, 1972, p. 16. In Louisiana ex rel. Elliot v. Jumel, 107 U.S. 711 (1882), a majority of the Court upheld the \\"nominal party rule\\" but refused to invoke it on a technicality.Durchslag, 2002, p. 54. In New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76 (1883), the Court abandoned the \\"nominal party rule\\" in favor of a \\"real party interest test.\\"Durchslag, 2002, p. 55. The Court openly rejected the rule (without necessarily overturning its previous decision) in In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443 (1887).Durchslag, 2002, p. 57. Nevertheless, the Court did not overturn Lee but rather distinguished it narrowly and continued to affirm its basic principles in Jumel and Ayers.Seamon, 1998, p. 173-174. United States v. Lee also sharply limited the sovereign immunity doctrine by implying that it could be subordinated to other, more fundamental rights such as the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against \\"takings\\" without just compensation and due process.Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 82. Justice Miller's ringing endorsement of the rights of individuals is seen as endorsing the concept that, in the United States, the people are the sovereign—not the government.Pfafflin, 1992, p. 657. In Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204 (1897), the Supreme Court expressly extended the Lee decision to \\"takings\\" suits against states (which had previously been barred by the Court's constitutional interpretations).Rosenblatt, 2000, p. 732; Seamon, 2001, p. 1081.Berger, 2006, p. 543. Although Lee seemed to invite a full-scale reconsideration of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, subsequent Supreme Court decisions in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corporation, 337 U.S. 682 (1949) and Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643 (1962) sharply limited the impact of the Lee Court's decision.Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 82-88.Meyer, 1998, p. 141. Larson and Malone specifically carved out only two areas in which an officer of the United States may be sued: 1) If the officer acts outside her or his legally prescribed scope of authority, or 2) If the officer acts in a way that is unconstitutional.Sisk, Noone, Steadman, and Lester, 2006, p. 89. At least one legal historian has concluded that Lee also laid an early foundation for the doctrine of executive immunity.Williams, 1997, p. 976. In many ways, the Lee decision is also more famous for its defense of the rights of citizens than its sovereign immunity jurisprudence. Miller's defense of the rights of the individual (\\"No man...is above the law...\\") is considered \\"elegantly elaborated\\" by lawyer Lawrence Walsh.Walsh, 1998, p. 1379. Constitutional law scholar Louise Weinberg called the language \\"ringing\\".Weinberg, 2001, p. 1171. Another legal scholar called the language \\"remarkable\\" and emphatic.

Later he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and then refined his technical skills with François-Édouard Picot, who followed the same lineage of contemporaneous artists such as Léon Perrault, Bouguereau, and Alexandre Cabanel. Afterwards he spent some time in Italy searching for inspiration; he may have also studied in Berlin. After five years abroad, he returned to Paris, where he made his debut at the Salon in 1850. In subsequent Salons he showed works in many media: oil paintings, drawings, pastels and watercolors. His painting Innocence shows his romantic view of the peasant children and their environment. He painted mythological and religious subjects, as well as commissioned portraits. Zuber-Buhler exhibited in the United States at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and achieved considerable success. He exhibited at the Salon (Paris) until 1891, by which time the European academic tradition he represented was past its heyday.Fada, fine art dealers association .

The highest level of league play in Palau in represented by Palau Major League (PML), which is overseen by the Belau Baseball Federation.http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=2-3853-0-0-0&sID;=40261&&news;_task=DETAIL&articleID;=9668642&sectionID;=40261 The country is represented in international play by the Palau national baseball team. The PML plays its games at the Asahi Field in Koror during a season lasting from January to April. No admission fee is charged for games.Hollywood, Mike. Papa Mike's Palau Islands Handbook. (Lincoln: iUniverse, 2006), 49. As of 2002 there were seven teams in the PML in one division. History =1914-1944: Japanese Occupation= Baseball was first brought to Palau by the Japanese, who annexed the islands from Germany in 1914 and controlled them until losing the Battle of Peleliu in November 1944. One noted early promoter of baseball on the islands was Motoji Kono, who worked for the Imperial Japanese government on Palau from 1922 to 1929. He is credited with a foundational role in Palauan baseball for his work teaching Palauan men the basic skill sets and rules necessary to play the game, as well as being an energetic promoter of the sport, primarily from 1925 onwards.Shuster, Donald. Baseball in Palau: Passion for the Game From 1925-2007. (Guam: University of Guam, 2008), 5-6. Most Palauan players in the 1920s were employed with the Japanese administration on the island.Shuster, 8. In 1927 and 1928, a team of top Palauan players dubbed the All Palau Team played an annual series against a team composed of Japanese administrators. Although the Japanese won the first series, the All Palau team took 1928 match, leading the Japanese to segregate baseball on the island so that Palauans and Japanese players competed amongst themselves but not against each other.Shuster, 7-8. =1945-1959: PML's Early Years= American soldiers who occupied Palau at the end of and following World War II further promoted the game on the island. American soldiers provided endurance training and helped develop the islanders' pitching and fielding, particularly working to cultivate their infield skills.Shuster, 16, 18. The PML was founded in 1947,Shuster, 20. with the league culminating in the All-Palau Baseball Championship. A team from Peleliu was dominant in the postwar years, winning seven titles between 1947 and 1957. Peleliu suffered a notable defeat in the 1955 All-Palau Baseball Championship to a team of students from Koror Intermediate School.Shuster, 18-20. =1960-1969: First International Success= Peleliu won three championships in the 1960s: in 1960, 1961 and 1969. The team hasn't won a PML championship since 1969. In 1962, the Airai Comets won the PML championship for the first time, defeating the Ngardmau Cardinals.Shuster, 20. In the same year, a team of Palauan all-stars secured the nation's first success in international competition, winning a three-game set against a team of Guamanian all-stars 2-0. Palau was the visiting team for the series, which was held at Chief Quipuha Park.Guam Daily News. July 9, 1962, 13. Included in Shuster, 20-21.Guam Daily News, July 10, 1962, 13. Included in Shuster, 21. The team was a sensation upon its arrival in Palau, where they were hosted at the Kebtol'l Bai (double bai) in Koror. Bai is the local Palauan name for the steep-roofed shelter built as a meeting place for the village elders. Chiefs from all the clans in Palau were present for a feast held in the team's honor.Shuster, 24. In 1963, Palau Vocational School defeated Ngardmau to become the first student team to win the All-Palau Championship since 1955. The 1963 trophy is still kept in the trophy case at Palau Community College (PCC).Shuster, 25. A team of Palauan all-stars participated in further international competition in 1963, defeating a team from Xavier High School on Chuuk and winning a three-game series against a team of Pohnpei all-stars, two games to one. The final game narrowly avoided a rainout that would have led to a Pohnpei victory as Palau only pulled ahead in the late innings. As such, much credit for the victory was given to the Palauan team magician for overcoming the spells of the Pohnpeiian magician.Shuster, 26-29. For the 1966 season, the PML contained ten teams divided into two, five team leagues. The Palau League contained Palau High School, Melekeok, Ngaremlengui, Peleliu A, and Airai. The Territorial League contained the Ngaraard Red Torch, Ngiwal, Koror, Aimeliik, and Peleliu B.Shuster, 29-31. However, the number and identity of the teams that participated in the PML varied significantly from year to year. The Ngardmau Cardinals won the 1967 All Palau Baseball Championship, defeating team Asahi. The team won again in 1968, and went on to defeat a team of Palauan all-stars in the same year. The PML had seven teams in one division for the 1968 season. The competing teams were the Cardinals, Asahi, the Red Torch, Ngarametal, Ngarabelod, Ngarchelong and Peleliu.Didil A Chais, Vol 1, No 7, June 24, 1968, 24. Included in Shuster, 36-37. Peleliu won the 1969 championship, going 8-2 over the course of the regular season.Shuster, 43-45. The Palauan National Baseball Team participated in the 1969 Micronesian Olympic Games in Saipan.Shuster, 45-46. =1970-1979: Red Torch Dominate= There are few existing records chronicling the PML in the 1970s,Shuster, 50. but the Red Torch appear to have dominated the decade. The team won the All-Palau Baseball Championship in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. Meyuns won the championship in 1971, and Palau High School won in 1972. Meyuns repeated in 1975. Asahi field also underwent a renovation at some point the 1970s that included covered bleachers.Shuster, 50-51. In 1973, a lawsuit was brought by the team from Ngaremlengui against the Aimeliik team for a game that Ngaremlengui won in the bottom of the ninth that the manager of the Aimeliik team felt should have concluded in the top of the ninth due to time limitations. The Parks Board ruled in favor of Aimeliik, leading Ngaremlengui to file suit against the decision.Shuster, 48-49. =1980-1989: Rise of the Airai Aces= The 1981 PML season was canceled to allow the Palauan national team time to prepare for the 1981 Ambassadors Memorial Baseball Tournament in Guam. The tournament was played from May 22 to May 31, and in addition to the team from Palau included the Ponape All-Stars, who represented all the Federated States of Micronesia, Athletes in Action Ambassadors, the University of Guam Tritons, and the APL Los Amigos, that year's champions of the Island Baseball League in Guam. Palau's team lost in the semi-finals, with Los Amigos winning the tournament.Shuster, 51-54. The Airai Aces won every championship between 1982 and 1989 save for 1986.Shuster, 55. Peleliu opted to forfeit the third game of the 1982 championship after dropping the first two games, and lost to Airai in the 1982 championship as well. Ngerbeches overcame Airai in the 1986 PML championship series, winning the set 3-2.Shuster, 76. As of 1989, there were five teams in the PML in one division.United States Department of State, United States Navy Department, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, United States Office of Territories. Report to the United Nations on the administration of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. [U.S.] United States Department of State, United States Navy Department, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, United States Office of Territories, 1989. 49. =1990-1999: Aces Continue to Dominate= The Airai Aces' success continued into the 1990s, with the team taking the PML Championship outright in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, and splitting the championship with Ngerbeched in 1991. Ngerbeched won the PML Finals in 1993 and 1997. A joint Ngerbeched- Ngerbeches team was the 1998 PML champion.Shuster, 81-93. Palau's national team took the gold medal for baseball in the 1990 Micronesian Games in Saipan, beating Guam 8-0 in the final,Shuster, 82. and in the 1998 Games held in Palau.Shuster, 91-93. Palau took the bronze in baseball in the 1994 Micronesian Games.Shuster, 131. The 1999 PML season was cut short to allow Palau's athletes to train for the South Pacific Games, in which Palau finished 5th in baseball.Shuster, 93. =2000-Present: Koror wins First Title= The PML had seven teams in one division for the 2000 season.Shuster, 93. Ngerbeched was the 2000 PML champion, the team's third title in a row (not including the shortened 1999 season for which no champion was announced). Ngerbeched repeated in 2001, narrowly defeating Aimeliik in the finals.Shuster, 94-96. Airai returned to form to take the 2002, 2003 and 2004 titles,Shuster, 100-112.

The company was co- founded in 2010 by Patrice Wilson, who partnered with producer/composer and multi-instrumentalist Clarence Jey. In May 2011, Jey left Ark Music Factory to focus on his own production company Music Intersection. Later in 2011, Patrice Wilson established his own enterprise, Pato Music World. Business Patrice Wilson co-founded Ark Music Factory in 2010; Wilson was also the CEO of the company. Ark's business centered on the recruitment/discovery of new young singers. The artists paid a $2,000 to $4,000 fee to Ark, and Ark then wrote and produced music in collaboration with the artists, often producing music videos and promotion of the songs. The singer owned the master recording, while Ark retained the publishing rights to the songs and all the sales from the song. They stated that their main objectives were to bring aspiring acts to the musical fore: \\"We at Ark make it possible for an emerging artist to be discovered, defined and delivered, to advance in their chosen career and be successful.\\" Ark was predominantly based in the US, although they claimed that artists they had supported have had success in different regions across the globe. Ark's Facebook page claimed to be creating a community where artists from all fields can come together to build connections and interact. Their website also claimed that their dedicated team had industry professionals who have worked with Miley Cyrus, the Backstreet Boys, and Ashley Tisdale. Wilson also rebuffed claims of exploitation, claiming that the company provided a relatively inexpensive entry into the pop market for artists: > \\"I'm getting a lot of criticism saying I'm exploiting rich kids and their > parents,\\" says Wilson, \\"but find me another company that would do all this > at a cost this low. I don't promise anyone fame. In fact, if someone > approaches me with their only goal to ‘get famous,' I tell them they're not > in this for the right reasons.\\" The staff of Ark Music Factory included Patrice Wilson (also known with the name Pato for his various acts) who was the founder of the company, CEO and Sri Lankan / Australian record producer, songwriter and co-founder and producer, Clarence Jey. At Ark, Jey wrote the music and Wilson wrote the lyrics. Ian Hotchkiss and Chris Lowe were the video directors. Rebecca Black and Friday In March 2011, Ark gained notoriety through a viral video when one of their songs, Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\" (which also includes raps by Wilson) unexpectedly became an Internet meme. According to the British newspaper The Independent, Black trended high on Twitter, after the release. The original video gained 167 million views until June 2011 when it was removed from YouTube due to copyright claims from Black's family. It has been reinstated in September 2011 on Black's personal YouTube channel and has been viewed over 140 million times as of March 2020. Wilson posted two music responses about \\"Friday\\" and the controversy it created. The first was posted on March 13, 2011 entitled \\"Friday (Rap Remix)\\" written and produced by Wilson and Jey, the second on April 4, 2011 entitled \\"Say What You Wanna Say\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bus6a5oHqhM written by Wilson and Kustom. Both songs addressed some of the most common grievances against the song and the way Ark runs its business. Both these postings received negative attention as well.

She has also used the stage name Fella Soltana.  Biography Fella Ababsa was born in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis, France, then moved to Algeria with her family a couple of years later. She comes from a well- known Algerian artistic family. Her father Abdelhamid Ababsa was a poet, musician and singer. Her brother Najeeb is a popular singer and so is her sister Naima. From a very young age she was surrounded by Andalousian and Algerian music, and learnt the piano and the Oud as well as other musical instruments. At 15 years old, she joined musical groups in the capital, then aged 20 she left for a series of shows in London where she had built up publicity and stayed for several years and perfected her knowledge of oriental music. She also performed in the United States in the early 1990s. Though she's Algerian, she often sings in Egyptian-Arabic, as she never could get popularity in the Maghreb, she went later on to Egypt and the Middle-East and with success. However Ababsa's first songs were sung in Algerian-Arabic, she also sings occasionally in English, like in 'Rani Jay'. Probably the most remarkable point about her is that she never sung in French, which is widely used by North-African singers. The first single on Lama ra Eato, Enta Habibi (You are my honey), ranked No. 5 on the official Pepsi Top Ten on the Rotana charts Fulla stated at a news conference she held in Dubai that Syrian singer Assala Nasri and her husband Tarek Al Eryan helped her enter Egypt. Fulla is signed to Rotana the biggest record company in the Middle East. Personal life She was married to an Algerian at age 16/17, and had with him her daughter, Saida, where they lived together in the United Kingdom, then they divorced and she came back to Algeria. Later on, she married Kuwaiti businessman Najeeb Al-Mutawa, and a man who was 15 years younger than her. In 1996, she was accused of \\"adultery\\" when she was engaged to Egyptian footballer Gamal Abdel-Hamid in Egypt, thus she was sentenced for three years in prison and to be banned from entering Egypt afterwards. She later accused Tunisian singer Latifa, and Egyptian lawyer Mortada Mansour, of being behind that false accusation. In 2011, she tried to enter Egypt but she was denied entry.

History San Diego's Chinatown began in the area in the 1860s, settled by abalone fishermen. The area was once a thriving Chinatown full of Chinese and Chinese-Americans. However, in present day, the area no longer has an especially large Chinese population. After returning from service in World War II, Chinese-Americans moved to other areas of San Diego. The area was finally concluded as a Historic District during the redevelopment of the Gaslamp Quarter in the 1980s and 90s, when eventually dozens of Chinese owned businesses closed and the majority of the Chinese population began to dissipate. The area was not only home to the Chinese community in San Diego, but was also shared by the Japanese and Filipino communities. The City of San Diego designated the area a historic district in 1987.

It is the only standard test methodology that allows for complete validation of Ethernet service-level agreements (SLAs) in a single test. Purposes ITU-T Y.1564 is designed to serve as a network service level agreement (SLA) validation tool, ensuring that a service meets its guaranteed performance settings in a controlled test time, to ensure that all services carried by the network meet their SLA objectives at their maximum committed rate, and to perform medium- and long-term service testing, confirming that network elements can properly carry all services while under stress during a soaking period. ITU-T Y.1564 defines an out-of-service test methodology to assess the proper configuration and performance of an Ethernet service prior to customer notification and delivery. The test methodology applies to point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connectivity in the Ethernet layer and to the network portions that provide, or contribute to, the provisioning of such services. This recommendation does not define Ethernet network architectures or services, but rather defines a methodology to test Ethernet-based services at the service activation stage. Existing test methodologies: RFC 2544 The Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2544 is a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices. This request for comments (RFC) was created in 1999 as a methodology to benchmark network devices such as hubs, switches and routers as well as to provide accurate and comparable values for comparison and benchmarking. RFC 2544 provides engineers and network technicians with a common language and results format. The RFC 2544 describes six subtests: * Throughput: Measures the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device/system under test (DUT/SUT). This measurement translates into the available bandwidth of the Ethernet virtual connection. * Back-to-back or burstability: Measures the longest burst of frames at maximum throughput or minimum legal separation between frames that the device or network under test will handle without any loss of frames. This measurement is a good indication of the buffering capacity of a DUT. * Frame loss: Defines the percentage of frames that should have been forwarded by a network device under steady state (constant) loads that were not forwarded due to lack of resources. This measurement can be used for reporting the performance of a network device in an overloaded state, as it can be a useful indication of how a device would perform under pathological network conditions such as broadcast storms. * Latency: Measures the round- trip time taken by a test frame to travel through a network device or across the network and back to the test port. Latency is the time interval that begins when the last bit of the input frame reaches the input port and ends when the first bit of the output frame is seen on the output port. It is the time taken by a bit to go through the network and back. Latency variability can be a problem. With protocols like voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), a variable or long latency can cause degradation in voice quality. * System reset: Measures the speed at which a DUT recovers from a hardware or software reset. This subtest is performed by measuring the interruption of a continuous stream of frames during the reset process. * System recovery: Measures the speed at which a DUT recovers from an overload or oversubscription condition. This subtest is performed by temporarily oversubscribing the device under test and then reducing the throughput at normal or low load while measuring frame delay in these two conditions. The difference between delay at overloaded condition and the delay and low load conditions represent the recovery time. From a laboratory and benchmarking perspective, the RFC 2544 methodology is an ideal tool for automated measurement and reporting. From a service turn-up and troubleshooting perspective, RFC 2544, although acceptable and valid, does have some drawbacks: * Service providers are shifting from only providing Ethernet pipes to enabling services. Networks must support multiple services from multiple customers, and each service has its own performance requirements that must be met even under full load conditions and with all services being processed simultaneously. RFC 2544 was designed as a performance tool with a focus on a single stream to measure maximum performance of a DUT or network under test and was never intended for multiservice testing. * With RFC 2544's focus on identifying the maximum performance of a device or network under test, the overall test time is variable and heavily depends on the quality of the link and subtest settings. RFC 2544 test cycles can easily require a few hours of testing. This is not an issue for lab testing or benchmarking, but becomes a serious issue for network operators with short service maintenance windows. * Packet delay variation is a key performance indicator (KPI) for real time services such as VoIP and Internet protocol television (IPTV) and is not measured by the RFC 2544 methodology. Network operators that performed service testing with RFC 2544 typically must execute external packet jitter testing outside of RFC 2544 as this KPI was not defined or measured by the RFC. * Testing is performed sequentially on one KPI after another. In today's multiservice environments, traffic is going to experience all KPIs at the same time, although throughput might be good, it can also be accompanied by very high latency due to buffering. Designed as a performance assessment tool, RFC 2544 measures each KPI individually through its subtest and therefore cannot immediately associate a very high latency with a good throughput, which should be cause for concern. Service definitions The ITU-T Y.1564 defines test streams (individually called a \\"Test Flow\\") with service attributes linked to the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) 10.2 definitions. Test Flows are traffic streams with specific attributes identified by different classifiers such as 802.1q VLAN, 802.1ad, DSCP and class of service (CoS) profiles. These services are defined at the UNI level with different frame and bandwidth profile such as the service's maximum transmission unit (MTU) or frame size, committed information rate (CIR), and excess information rate (EIR). A single Test Flow is also able to consist of up to 5 different frame sizes called an EMIX (Ethernet Mix). This flexibility allows the engineer to configure a Test Flow very close to real world traffic. Test rates The ITU Y.1564 defines three key test rates based on the MEF service attributes for Ethernet virtual connection (EVC) and user-to-network interface (UNI) bandwidth profiles. * CIR defines the maximum transmission rate for a service where the service is guaranteed certain performance objectives. These objectives are typically defined and enforced via SLAs. * EIR defines the maximum transmission rate above the committed information rate considered as excess traffic. This excess traffic is forwarded as capacity allows and is not subject to meeting any guaranteed performance objectives (best effort forwarding). * Overshoot rate defines a testing transmission rate above CIR or EIR and is used to ensure that the DUT or network under test does not forward more traffic than specified by the CIR or EIR of the service. Service configuration test Forwarding devices such as switches, routers, bridges and network interface units are the basis of any network as they interconnect segments. If a service is not correctly configured on any one of these devices within the end-to-end path, network performance can be greatly affected, leading to potential service outages and network-wide issues such as congestion and link failures. The Service configuration test is designed to measure the ability of DUT or network under test to properly forward in different states: * In the CIR phase, where performance metrics for the service are measured and compared to the SLA performance objectives. * In the EIR phase, where performance is not guaranteed and the services transfer rate is measured to ensure that CIR is the minimum bandwidth. * In the discard phase, where the service is generated at the overshoot rate and the expected forwarded rate is not greater than the committed information rate or excess rate (when configured). * In the CBS (Committed Burst Size) phase, performance metrics are measured while changing traffic from the CIR to the line rate. * In the EBS (Excess Burst Size) phase, performance metrics are measured while changing traffic from the EIR to the line rate. Service performance test As network devices come under load, they must prioritize one traffic flow over another to meet the KPIs set for each traffic class. With only one traffic class, there is no prioritization performed by the network devices since there is only one set of KPIs. As the number of traffic flows increase, prioritization is necessary and performance failures may occur. The service performance test measures the ability of the DUT or network under test to forward multiple services while maintaining SLA conformance for each service. Services are generated at the CIR, where performance is guaranteed, and pass/fail assessment is performed on the KPI values for each service according to its SLA. Service performance assessment must also be maintained for a medium- to long-term period as performance degradation will likely occur as the network is under stress for longer period of times. The service performance test is designed to soak the network under full committed load for all services and measure performance over medium and long test time. The time frame to complete this section of the test is recommended to follow ITU-T M.2110 which mentions intervals of 15min, 2hour or 24hour allowing network availability to be determined. Metrics The Y.1564 focuses on the following KPIs for service quality: * Bandwidth or Information rate (IR): This is a bit rate measure of available or consumed data communication resources expressed in bits/second or multiples of it (kilobits/s, megabits/s, etc.) * Frame transfer delay (FTD): Also known as latency, this is a measurement of the time delay between the transmission and the reception of a frame. Typically this is a round-trip measurement, meaning that the calculation measures both the near-end to far-end and far-end to near-end direction simultaneously. * Frame delay variations (FDV): Also known as packet jitter, this is a measurement of the variations in the time delay between packet deliveries. As packets travel through a network to their destination, they are often queued and sent in bursts to the next hop. There may be prioritization at random moments also resulting in packets being sent at random rates. Packets are therefore received at irregular intervals. The direct consequence of this jitter is stress on the receiving buffers of the end nodes where buffers can be overused or underused when there are large swings of jitter. * Frame loss ratio (FLR): Typically expressed as a ratio, this is a measurement of the number of packets lost over the total number of packets sent. Frame loss can be due to a number of issues such as network congestion or errors during transmissions. * Frame loss ratio with reference to the SAC: Typically expressed as a Pass / Fail indication. SAC (Service Acceptance Criteria) is the part of the network operators SLA which references the FLR requirement for the network path under test. * Availability (AVAIL): Typically expressed as a % of up time for link under test for example does the network pass the 5 \\"9's\\" 99.999% up time.

MAP grew out of a 1960s lawsuit against the United Church of Christ and was eventually formed in 1972 in order to advance the rights of the public wanting to participate in the democratic process. Some of their first cases involved two TV stations in Mississippi not catering to the African American Community, resulting in the stations almost being shut down. From that era and cases came the thought \\"that members of the viewing and listening public have the legal right, derived from the First Amendment, to participate in FCC proceedings.\\" Their most common way of fighting cases was through lobbying. The group suspended operations on May 1, 2012. Issues addressed =Comcast NBC-Universal deal= On January 18, 2011, cable and internet giant Comcast acquired NBC Universal in a blockbuster deal. At the time, Comcast was the largest distributor of video services in the United States. The FCC voted in favor of it by a 4-1 count. The deal gave Comcast a 51% ownership of NBC Universal, and \\"For Comcast, the purchase is the realization of its long-held ambition to be a major producer of television shows and movies\\". There was some concern about media consolidation, as expressed by Michael J. Copps, commissioner of the FCC. \\"Every citizen has a stake here,” given the size of the combined entity. “The lodestar for this review must be the public interest\\". The Media Access Project is concerned that the terms of the deal prevent competition, and could result in price gouging due to fewer media sources. Critics fear that \\"Comcast will act as a gatekeeper by limiting the ability of independent voices to get a slot on cable distribution systems, or by withholding NBC-Universal content from other platforms and providers\\". =Media ownership= The issue revolves around the idea that those who control the media control what information people do and don't have access to. If you have an ownership group that is biased toward, or against a certain argument, or cause, then the media that they own will only give one side of the story. According to Free Press \\"But these massive conglomerates — like General Electric, Time Warner and News Corporation — only care about the bottom line, not serving the public interest. And allowing these few firms too much control over the flow of news and information is dangerous for our democracy\\". In 2003, the Media Access Project's lawyers filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals, trying to nullify the FCC's media ownership rules that were going to take effect. The case was filed on behalf of Prometheus Radio Project of Philadelphia and the Media Access Project wanted to prevent the new media ownership rules until the judicial review was completed. The court ended up siding with the Media Access Project and struck down the FCC's new media ownership regulations. On March 23, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals lifted a ban that had prevented media companies from owning both a TV station and newspaper in the same region, or market. Part of the media ownership debate includes that of media concentration. Media concentration is when a large amount of media outlets are owned by a small number of companies. According to the MAP website, media concentration not only limits diversity, but also \\"threatens an outlet’s accountability to local communities, since big companies are often unfamiliar with a community’s specific needs.\\" In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration started deregulating the broadcasting industries, which led to the trend of media consolidation. Media Access Project Director Andrew Scwartzman commented: \\"Deregulation has brought a new breed of broadcaster to whom public service matters less.\\" =Net neutrality= One of the larger issues that Media Access Project concerns itself with is the concept of Net Neutrality. However a concern that still comes up quite often is that ambiguity in network management may diminish opportunity and innovation within the internet business which in turn may lead to unfair competition. For MAP the main focus with net neutrality is urging the FCC to ensure that network operators do not block or slow down the transmission of certain types of online content. One of the bigger cases that lead to current net neutrality rules was in 2007 when internet service provider Comcast was caught directly manipulating or blocking their subscriber's access to the popular file sharing service BitTorrent. MAP filed a petition with the FCC stating that Comcast had violated several of the agencies policies. A more recent court case dealing with the current net neutrality rules being challenged by cellular giant Verizon Wireless was thrown out because the company supposedly filed the lawsuit prematurely. Specifically Verizon Wireless was challenging the Open Internet Framework and felt that the FCC had too broad of an authority for the new regulation of broadband network. However MAP senior vice president Andrew Schwartzman hinted that Verizon was trying to exploit the system saying “It was a blatant effort to steer the case to a sympathetic court, but the judges agreed that the appeal was prematurity was incurable.” =Spectrum access= Spectrum access refers to the electromagnetic spectrum, which is a set of frequency bands that transmit electronic communications. According to their website, the Media Access Project has three principles involving spectrum management: “Spectrum belongs to the public, and the law prevents the FCC from turning it into private property; those with exclusive rights to use spectrum must also serve the public interest; and the public is best served by allowing as many people, institutions, and other entities to use spectrum space as technology will permit, the FCC should therefore expand unlicensed uses to the extent technology allows.” The MAP argues that allowing greater public access to the spectrum would allow greater social and economic growth. In 2002, the FCC granted additional flexibility for spectrum use, which led to many public interest groups and wireless carriers to send comments about the policy change. The comments covered a variety of topics from redefining harmful interference and rural spectrum management. There was also a debate between whether or not there should be an increase in usable spectrum between public interest groups and wireless service providers. The FCC allowed a new portion of high-frequency spectrum to be allocated for WiFi networks in 2003. The spectrum was open to any company and did not require the purchase of a license, but was limited by how much power a device could use to transmit the signal. Associate Director of the MAP, Harold Feld, claimed that combining a high frequency and low power limits would mean that the allocated spectrum would be too weak its intended purpose. In 2007, the Media Access Project was a part of the Save Our Spectrum Coalition, whose goal was to allow consumers to use any equipment, content, application or service without interference or discrimination from network providers. The group wanted network providers to bid on the spectrum through separate affiliates operating under open access conditions. Later, the Media Access Project claimed that the incumbent companies that already owned spectrum access blocked new competitors from entering the market. The group stated that if the auction had been anonymous, smaller companies would be more likely to bid against the incumbent companies. Notable staff =Andrew Jay Schwartzman= Andrew Schwartzman is a media attorney who has worked with MAP since June 1978. He is currently the Senior Vice President and Policy Director, and previously held the position of President and CEO. He has worked with MAP since He now holds the title of Senior Vice President and Policy Director. Andrew represents MAP before \\"Congress, the FCC and the courts on issues such as cable TV regulation, minority and female ownership and employment in the mass media,“equal time” laws and cable “open access”. The Media Access Project's policy director Andrew Schwartzman developed an idea and filed a petition with the FCC in March 2011 “arguing that it should force political groups to disclose information about their top donors when they run political ads.” Schwartzman noted that the FCC had the ability to put this policy into act for several decades under the Communications Act of 1934. Previous rules only required disclosure from the group claiming responsibility for the advertisement. The specifics of the petition are that it “asks the FCC to revise its rules to require groups to disclose financial backers who contribute more than 10% of the group’s budget and on-air disclosures from donors who provide more than 25% of a television commercial’s budget or more than 33% of the cost of a radio commercial.” Sources Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Early life and background James Malcolm was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, on 13 January 1767, and died in Milnholm, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, on 27 December 1849. James was the second son of George Malcolm of Burnfoot, and his wife, the former Margaret Paisley. James was thus the older brother of Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm RN; Major- General Sir John Malcolm, Madras Army; and Vice Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm, RN. The boys' maternal uncle was Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley, 1st Baronet. Royal Marine officer Malcolm was commissioned in what would later become known as the Royal Marines in 1779 at the age of twelve. During the American Revolutionary War he was assigned to the Channel Fleet. In October, 1782, the fifteen-year-old Marine Lieutenant participated in Howe's final relief of the British forces in the Great Siege of Gibraltar, and the subsequent Battle of Cape Spartel, under the orders of Admiral Lord Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe. Royal Marine Captain James Malcolm fought at sea under the command of Vice Admiral Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet in the Battle of San Domingo. In the course of the fighting, in which Royal Marines played an important role, all of the enemy's ships of the line were either captured or destroyed. For his valour in that action, Captain Malcolm was brevetted a Major on the Army List with seniority in that grade dating 6 February 1806. Seaborne, shore, and amphibious operations In July 1812 Brevet Major Malcolm was named to command the 2nd of the two Royal Marines Battalions which were then in service. He led the battalion in Spain until January 1813. In the spring of 1813 he sailed with his command to the North American and West Indies Station. Participating in operations on the Chesapeake in the summer of 1813, he was rewarded by a second brevet promotion, this time to Lieutenant Colonel, on the British Army List. In October 1813 he accompanied his battalion to Canada. Together with a 200-man detachment of the Canadian Fencibles, the Marines formed a corps of observation and reconnaissance watching the American forces under Major General James Wilkinson. In May 1814, Malcolm's 2nd battalion of Royal Marines served together with a mixed British expeditionary force of veteran Scotsmen, Swiss, Canadian militiamen, and armed sailors, which probed American outposts on Lake Ontario in the Battle of Fort Oswego. Malcolm's Royal Marines battalion made up about half of the actual landing force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Karl Victor Fischer (1766–1821) of the De Watteville regiment, (a veteran Swiss regiment in British pay), which assaulted and carried the American positions. Both Fischer and Malcolm were praised for their active role in the action.http://www.napoleon- series/military/Warof1812/2006/Issue3/c_oswego.html Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm commanded another battalion on the Chesapeake in the Battle of Bladensburg; the burning of Washington; and the Battle of Baltimore. Malcolm and his Marines continued to operate on the Atlantic coast, as far south as Georgia's Sea Islands and Spanish Florida, until the peace was established in May 1815. In addition to the brevet promotions on the Army List, Sir James Malcolm was knighted in 1815 as a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) for his valour and merit on the North American Station. Later career and retirement Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Sir James Malcolm continued to serve in the peace establishment until 1827. He advanced to the substantive rank of Major in the Royal Marines in 1821. In 1826 he was confirmed in the substantive rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Corps of Royal Marines. Sir James then retired to Dumfriesshire, Scotland, where he figured among members of his household on the 1841 Scotland Census.

Written by business professional and former U.S. Air Force Captain Glen R. Sondag, the book was originally intended as a guide for Sondag's four sons. It instead turned into an illustrated guide on fashion basics, such as dressing for body type, choosing suits and accessories, fabrics, rules of office fashion, and clothing brand selection. As of March 2011 it is available in paperback and as an eBook. Overview =History= Sondag claims he first developed his fashion sense and love of clothes from his mother, a skilled seamstress who made all her own clothes, and many of his. At a young age she taught him about fabrics, tailoring, fit, clothing construction, and dressing appropriately. Sondag, who graduated with a B.A. from the University of St. Thomas, worked at a men's clothing retailer while attending graduate school. While there he spent most of his earnings on clothing. Following service as a Captain in the U.S. Air Force, Sondag joined Merrill Lynch as a financial advisor in 1972, and formed The Sondag Group in Northbrook, Illinois with his son Michael in 1997. Sondag, who has been married to the same woman since 1969, claims he originally began writing Anything Other Than Naked as a \\"do's and don'ts\\" dressing guide for his four sons. =Content= The book contains illustrated chapters on clothing tips for men, such as selecting and wearing each clothing item, matching suits, coats, shirts, and ties, choosing accessories, laundering, grooming, flattering your individual body type, and basic rules of office fashion (shoes should be darker than the suit, etc.). The book also covers what fashions are appropriate for different situations. Sondag, who is unsponsored by any clothing institutions, recommends a number of clothing brands, clothing stores, and catalogs that sell high-quality clothing at different price ranges. Sondag acknowledges in the book that men often get little fashion guidance from each other, distrust fashion articles for men, ignore girlfriends' tips, and are often confused by terms such as \\"business casual.\\" He has stated that \\"men rely on their instincts or whatever feels comfortable to them, often with disastrous results.\\" =Publishing history= The book was first made available in an eBook format on January 25, 2011 by book retailer Barnes & Noble. A paperback version was published by Langdon Street Press (English only) on February 14, 2011. The paperback is available on Amazon.com, where it is also sold in eBook form for the Kindle. On January 18, 2011 Sondag was interviewed by Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino of Best Ever You on the book in a special one-hour show. He is also a regular fashion columnist for Best Ever You, a fashion and well-being blog. The book was reviewed in Crain's Chicago Business on March 14, 2011.

The drama aired in 2003 on SETTV. Plot Legend has it a dolphin once helped to reunite a pair of tragic lovers. From then on, the well-adored animal became the guardian of love. At Dolphin Bay, a tale of love and myth continues. Two children, Zerya and Xiao Pin Gai, met at an orphanage. Seeing the latter was often bullied by the other kids, Zerya rose to the occasion to become her gallant protector. Alas, the young couple parted ways when the director of a big company Hsu Ruogu arrived to bring his ‘grandson’ home. Zerya promised to come back for Xiao Pin Gai but as he was returning a few days later, Xiao Pin Gai was already leaving the orphanage with her new adoptive mother. He returns again 20 years later to fulfill his promise, but his childhood friend is nowhere to be found. At Dolphin Bay, Zerya meets a young woman Tianbian. Her strong and optimistic character draws him to her, and Tianbian is touched by all that Zerya does for her. Tianbian actually is Xiao Pin Gai, Zerya's good friend back at the orphanage. Just like Zerya, Tianbian was adopted by her current mother. Zerya who was adopted by the Hsu family is currently an important leader in the company, SET. He lived with his grandfather, his step-mother and his half- sister, Shan-Ni. While Zerya lived in a well-to-do family, Tianbian and her mother were frequently harassed by a loan shark to pay back the money they borrowed from them. Touched by Tianbian's determination Zerya helped Tianbian to attend singing audition to select new talent in SET. Upon listening to Tianbian's singing, the music director Hsiao Kang instantly liked her voice and decided she will be SET's new voice for SkyWalk project, much to the dismay of SET's current singer, Mandy Chen. Being Hsiao Kang's lover during their working period, she viewed TianBian as a rival and vowed to challenge her. While working together, attraction blossoms between Zerya and Tianbian. However, Zerya soon found out that Tianbian was the real child his grandfather was looking for in the orphanage. Realizing that he had robbed Tianbian the opportunity of having the life he shouldn't, Zerya made a deal with the grandfather to marry Shan-Ni in return of acknowledging TianBian as his granddaughter. The situation was further complicated when Hsiao Kang fell for TianBian and Mandy became unreasonably jealous of this relationship. When Shan-Ni agreed to a fake marriage with Zerya, she actually fell in love with him and asked him to love her instead. As Zerya realized he could only love Tianbian, they found out Shan-Ni suffered from leukemia and had less than a year to live. He finally agreed to marry Shan-Ni out of pity while Tianbian decided to try loving Hsiao Kang who had helped her a lot. Meanwhile, Skywalk project ran into a dead end when Mandy decided to use all resources and her promotion to deprive Skywalk from being covered by media and public. Tianbian's single slumped in the market and was scoring low for the season. Hsiao Kang did not give up and tried his best to support Tianbian out of his love to her to the extent that he mortgaged his house to finance the album promotion. Luck turned to their sides when two foreigners who watched their performance in the street were actually two executives of internationally renowned perfume looking for brand ambassador in Taiwan. Tianbian was signed up for the advertisement and soon, her album picked up the market. The fact that they looked like Tianbian and Zerya had decided to live separate lives improved Tianbian's relationship with Hsu family. She even grew closer to Shan-Ni and really took her as an elder sister. Realizing that Tianbian was also his granddaughter, the grandfather grew warmer and acknowledged her fully. They even came as a family to support Tianbian's concert. In this concert, Hsiao Kang finally realized he did not want to lose Mandy and they rekindled their romance. During the concert, Shan-Ni collapsed and was in critical condition. She finally died in Zerya's arms after asking him to find happiness. A few years later, Zerya was seen as the top leader in SET interviewed by a foreign journalist. Tianbian was coming back after a world concert. She visited the old orphanage where she met Zerya for the first time. She received a purple shell sent by Hsiao Kang to the orphanage. Apparently, Zerya received another purple shell and was heading to the orphanage at the same time. As she is walking away, they pass each other. Although Zerya does not see her, he realizes it and asks for the car to stop. When he calls out to her with the name Xiao Pin Gai, TianBian turns around and runs into his arms. They hug and then share a kiss.

Pollination Because it is self-incompatible, flowers of one cactus require pollen from another individual of the species for fertilization; when plants are rare and spread apart, the likelihood that a pollinator will stop at the plant and deliver the correct pollen is lower. When fruits are successfully produced, they are often taken by jackrabbits and rodents for food. Dry conditions may increase this herbivory and decrease pollinator abundance.

Is located three miles from Zalamea de la Serena in the direction of Quintana de la Serena Quintana, in a small valley along the stream Cagancha. Cancho Roano is the best preserved Tartessian site. It dates back to at least the sixth century BCE, although the building was expanded and modified in later centuries. Based on the dating of objects found on the site, Cancho Roano is estimated to date from 550 BCE. The site was destroyed in a fire no later than 370 BCE. The building appears to have been ritually burned and sealed in rammed earth in a manner similar to Etruscan ceremonies.

Interior of the archaeological site The main body of the building is square and oriented toward the east. The building is surrounded by a deep moat, which was permanently filled with water. Although Cancho Roano's exact function is unknown, the religious character of the site is undeniable due to the presence of altars; however, the site may be a palace-shrine, judging from its defensive system. Excavations of the site, directed by John Maluquer de Motes, began in 1978 and continued through 2001. It was declared a National Monument in 1986. The site, along with an interpretation center, is open to the public. Richard Freund theorizes that Cancho Roano was a \\"memorial city\\" designed to serve as a ceremonial representation of the lost city of Tartessos, which, in Freund's theory, was also Atlantis.

It was there that sailing, surfing, the ocean, and the beach began to fill all available time. As a boy riding his bicycle through town, he noticed surf posters with artwork by Rick Griffin stapled to the telephone poles, an early influence on the young artist.Jackson, Devon, “The Long and The Short Of It,” Southwest Art, December 2003 A family move to Albuquerque, New Mexico became a formative influence in Short’s work: as a profound melancholy set in, he would find respite in painting and drawing the ocean. During these years, his feelings of being trapped in the desert began to change.Pezman, Steve “Trestles Suite,” The Surfers Journal, Vol. 11, number 3 Becoming a Hot Air Balloon Pilot and viewing the New Mexico desert from above gave Short a whole new appreciation for his new home.”California artist’s trip down historic Route 66 resulted in work showing nitty, gritty reality” American Art Collector, January, 2006 Though his parents were supportive of their son’s early artistic interests and obvious talent, Short’s desire to follow in his father’s footsteps as a scientist was his original vocational goal. This resolve was soon dashed, however, by conflicts with a High School Chemistry teacher. At the encouragement of Dorothy Black, a student of Lorser Feitelson, Short decided to reset his goals and study at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, CA. First, Short studied Painting at the University of New Mexico from 1978 to 1980, exploring Modernism, and Abstract Expressionism. Outside of classes, he painted murals and worked for the US Department of Defense, generating artwork for the Airborne Laser Laboratory’s Boeing NC-135. In 1980, Short moved back to California to study at Pepperdine University in Malibu as a stepping-stone to entrance at the Art Center College of Design. Before graduating from Art Center, Short introduced himself to his childhood hero, Rick Griffin, and requested an apprenticeship. Griffin responded instead with an offer of friendship. Griffin became a source of guidance and influence from this point in Short’s life.Weikel, Dan, “Surf Art Catches a Break” Los Angeles Times, January 31, 2006 In 1984, Short graduated and began a career painting advertisements for PepsiCo, Microsoft, Xerox, IBM, The Walt Disney Company, and various newspapers and magazines.Bellah, Suzanne, “Diffusion: Paintings of Blinding Light by Kevin Short,” Carnegie Art Museum, June 2013 Moving back to the beach inspired Short to resume painting the ocean and other subject matter relating to the surf subculture.

Du Bois and Herbert Aptheker, introduced to him by a white communist friend, Mark Hanson.Cox (2019), p. 23 He became affiliated with the Congress of Racial Equality, and in 1964 and 1965 he was involved in the series of protests directed against the Bank of America, San Francisco hotels, rental agencies and the automobile industry, who were discriminating against African- Americans. Cox joined the Oakland, California-based Black Panthers in 1967 in response to a civilian-shooting-by-police incident in the Hunters Point section of San Francisco a year earlier. Along with Eldridge Cleaver, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale and others, Cox was a member of the \\"central committee\\" of the Panthers. Initially Cox did not have a formal title within the Black Panther group, but his role was understood to relate to the usage of firearms. Cox had been taught to use firearms and hunt during his upbringing in Missouri, and as such was able to train other fellow members in proper usage of a weapon. Cox was also far more aware than fellow members of the laws regarding firearms and knew how to legally purchase them. He would eventually receive the title of \\"Field Marshal\\" in 1968, and would later use the moniker \\"Field Marshal DC\\" while campaigning for the BPP.Bukhari, S. (1992), Page 3 Cox became a national organizer and spokesperson for the group, which was involved in multiple legal cases and a target of the COINTELPRO project of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. In January 1970, Cox was invited to speak to several dozen guests of composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia at their penthouse apartment in the wealthy Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The gathering was an effort to raise funds for the defense of twenty-one Black Panther members who were charged with conspiracy to bomb buildings and other crimes. Cox was famously photographed along with the Bernsteins for a cover story essay by Tom Wolfe in New York magazine, published in June 1970 and entitled \\"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's\\". The article led to the popularization of \\"radical chic\\" as a critical term. Cox, along with the Bernsteins, vehemently dismissed Wolfe's notion that the New York upper class was dabbling in radical politics as a fashion statement at the event, vouching for their sincerity. Up to this point, Cox had been mainly based in his adopted home town of San Francisco but in the aftermath of the Panther 21 trial he moved to New York City in order to try and rebuild the party there, as well as provide some leadership for the East Coast-based chapters of the party.Cox (2019) p. 101, 102, 103 During this period when he was based on the East Coast, Cox was accused along with several others of conspiracy to murder a Panther who was an informant in Baltimore named Eugene Anderson. Cox fled the United States to avoid trial, living first in Algeria (where Eldridge and Kathleen Cleaver had already set up a base for exiled Panthers following their own escape from the US) and later in the Languedoc- Roussillon region of southern France. Cox did not return to the United States, although he married an American from Philadelphia, Barbara Easley. Cox resigned from the Black Panther Party in mid-1971. Amongst other things, the reasons he cited for leaving the party in his autobiography were his disappointment and frustrations with the main leaders of the party: Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, and David Hilliard. Cox suggests that Cleaver and particularly Newton became egomaniacs in light of the intense media spotlight the Panthers often found themselves under. Cox accuses Hilliard of becoming an unbearable autocrat in his role as BPP Chief of Staff, claiming Hilliard had embraced the practices of \\"Stalinism\\" and Marxism–Leninism upon reading Stalin's book Foundations of Leninism. Furthermore, Cox suggests that Hilliard began placing loyalty to the party above all else and that the slightest infraction would be cause enough for punishment, denouncement or expulsion from the Black Panther Party under his watch, with his orders being carried out by internal enforcers known as the \\"Black Guard\\" and \\"Buddha Samurai\\". Simultaneously, Cox says, Hilliard dismantled the power and authority of all other members of the Black Panther's central committee aside from himself, and that of Huey Newton, in a vicious drive for power.Cox (2019) p. 87, 88, 90, 96, 97 He died in exile in Camps-sur-l'Agly, France in February 2011. His daughter, Kimberly Cox-Marshall, had his autobiography published posthumously in 2019. Works * Cox, D. (2019) Just Another Nigger: My Life in the Black Panther Party Heyday Books.

The 45 minute episode was filmed in New York City.  Summary  A mother kills her own son, who has schizophrenia and issues with his medication. She kills him as she feels compelled to stop him from killing anyone else.  Setting  The episode is set in Washington Heights. Contextually, Washington Heights is considered an area with a low socioeconomic level in America. The demographics consist of immigrants; making up 48% of the population as of June 2015. Although, there has been a 'steep reduction in crime' it is still an issue of 'concern.' Rent is low in the area relative to the rest of Manhattan. Despite this affordability is an issue due to the relatively low household income level. Furthermore, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the unemployment rate for the area is 4% higher than the citywide range.  Plot  Alexander, J. Diamond, J. 2003. Law & Order: Mother's Day. Episode 10, season 13. NBC TV Network. Briscoe and Green are called to the scene of a hit-and-run accident in Washington Heights. When arriving at the scene; the victim is identified as high school student Emily Milius. From the tire marks on the road, the detectives suspect Ms. Milius was deliberately run down. The Miliuses are a wealthy family and when Briscoe says Emily Milius may have been deliberately targeted, the victim's father Ronald Milius reveals he is CFO of a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company and a witness in an FBI fraud investigation into the company's directors. This is significant considering the context of the setting. Furthermore, the Fortune 500 is a list of the largest US industrial corporations. In 2017, those the list represented two-thirds of U.S GDP. He thinks his daughter was killed as threat to him. A suspect green Saturn is discovered and forensic evidence proves the car struck Emily Milius. The car is registered to single mother Diane Payton, who tells Briscoe and Green she lent her car to her son Danny a few days earlier. The detectives are forced to break into Danny Payton's apartment where they discover his body. He has been stabbed to death. At this stage, the detectives think Danny Payton was hired to kill Emily Milius. The detectives speculate he took the job to support a suggested drug habit, and then killed himself, as directed by the hirer. But the medical examiner, Dr. Rodgers, reports no drugs in Danny Payton's system. When Green and Dr. Rodgers establish Danny's likely time of death, the detectives realize Diane Payton lied to them about the morning after the victim's death. Diane Payton is brought down to the 27th precinct, the police station for the detectives featured on Law & Order, for further questioning. Briscoe and Van Buren play good cop / bad cop with Mrs. Payton. Briscoe aggressively questions her. Van Buren timely enters the room and admonishes Briscoe for his rudeness, before inviting Mrs. Payton for a coffee and a private chat. Van Buren empathizes with Mrs. Payton over the difficulties of being a mother (\\"You're only as happy as your unhappiest kid\\"). Eventually, Diane Payton admits she stabbed her own son to death. She is arrested, and later arraigned to the court and enters a plea of not guilty. Mrs. Payton's attorney, Kay Hartley, approaches Southerlyn and identifies herself as an old college friend. Later, in a discussion with McCoy, Southerlyn reveals she remembers Hartley as a highly competitive student set upon becoming a high-earning Wall Street lawyer. Hartley says her firm has asked her to take on Mrs. Payton's case pro bono. McCoy is surprised a tax lawyer would be asked to try a criminal case. Later, Southerlyn is approached by Hartley while exercising in Central Park. Hartley reveals Danny Payton was her cousin and Diane Payton is her aunt. Hartley has taken a leave of absence from her firm to defend her aunt. Danny Payton had schizophrenia and Hartley wants to introduce his medical records into evidence, but Diane Payton refuses to allow this. Hartley wants to make a motion to enable this new evidence to come to life. Partially through sympathy, the DAs agree not to oppose the motion, which is granted. In the trial, psychiatrist Dr. Trask testifies Danny Payton was diagnosed with schizophrenia several years earlier and was held in a psychiatric hospital, but was eventually released, as medication proved effective in controlling his condition. He confirms Mrs. Payton recently requested her son be re-admitted to the hospital as his condition had worsened. However, Dr Trask refused his readmission once he established Danny had stopped taking his medications. When Diane Payton takes the stand to be questioned by Hartley, she admits her son had stopped taking his medication as it made him feel extremely depressed and nauseous. Subsequently, he began hearing voices urging him to kill. Following the refusal of the hospital to take Danny in, Mrs. Payton lent Danny her car (\\"long drives calmed him down.\\") It was on this drive he hit Emily Milius. This was the final straw. Diane Payton felt compelled to murder her son to prevent him from killing more people. McCoy demands a hearing in chambers. He is outraged the defense is effectively changing their plea from not guilty to guilty by justification. He demands the defense case be thrown out, but the judge refuses. McCoy's position begins to look weak. Southerlyn confronts Hartley, angry that Hartley played on her sympathy to get the medical records introduced. She accuses Hartley of being less motivated by love for her family and more by the boost it would provide to her career. The next day McCoy cross-examines Diane Payton and asks why she didn't inform the police of her son's suspected actions, or call the police herself after she killed him. Finally, McCoy asks that if Diane Payton knew her son was a homicidal man with schizophrenia, why did she willingly give him the keys to her car? The jury finds Diane Payton guilty of second-degree murder, but the jury foreperson asks if any jail time is necessary.

Plot In this film, William Murdoch is introduced, as a man of strong principles, who uses his unique abilities to solve crimes, sometimes using advanced science for his time. On the street of Toronto, in the 1890s, the naked body of a young chambermaid is found murdered, in a back alley. Inspector Brackenreid decides that this is an accidental death, but Murdoch feels there's more to the situation at hand. As Murdoch digs deeper into the death, he discovers that there is something more sinister going on and that the young girl was employed by a very rich and prominent family in Toronto. Her autopsy, conducted by forensic scientist Dr. Julia Ogden, working as coroner, reveals she was pregnant and had opium in her system, which makes Murdoch even more suspicious of her death.

He played and coached college baseball for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in the early 1900s. He also briefly coached and played minor league baseball from 1905 to 1906. After retiring from baseball, Utley had a successful career as a contracting engineer on building projects in Detroit. From 1931 to approximately 1948, he had an ownership interest in the Hotel Playa Ensenada, later renamed the Hotel Riviera del Pacífico, a luxury hotel in Baja California, Mexico.

After receiving his degree in 1903, Utley returned to Michigan as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1904. The Wolverines had a 10–5 record in Utley's only season as the head coach.

Utley was a member of the First Congregational Church, a Mason, and a member of the Detroit Athletic Club. Hotel Playa Ensenada In his later years, Utley was best known for his role as the owner of the Hotel Playa Ensenada, later renamed the Hotel Riviera del Pacífico. The hotel was a luxury resort built in the late 1920s during Prohibition, included a casino, and was located approximately 75 miles south of Tijuana. Jack Dempsey, the world heavyweight boxing champion, was one of the original owners, and guests included Marion Davies, William Randolph Hearst, Johnny Weissmuller and Myrna Loy. By 1931, the hotel's debt burden had become a problem, and Utley made a substantial investment in the hotel. Following Utley's investment, the hotel's business dropped off, as Prohibition was repealed in the United States and gambling was outlawed in Mexico. Utley became the hotel's principal owner in the 1930s, and the hotel was closed in 1938. Utley also formed a brief partnership with Dempsey to promote boxing matches. Dempsey and Utley were the promoters of the June 1933 heavyweight championship match between Max Schmeling and Max Baer. During World War II, the hotel as used as a military headquarters to guard against a Japanese attack on the United States through Baja California. After the war, Utley re- opened the hotel. Described as \\"a seventy-year-old bachelor,\\" Utley fell in love with Marjorie King Plant, described as \\"an attractive blond woman in her early forties.\\" Utley gave the hotel to Plant in approximately 1948, but later learned that she had married a Mexican lawyer. Utley filed a lawsuit against Plant, and she sold her interest in the hotel and returned to California. Utley died in 1959.

She is considered to be \\"one of the most important female figures of the Islamic West in the modern age\\". The life of Sayyida al Hurra can be understood within geopolitical and religious contexts. The Ottomans had just captured Constantinople in 1453 marking the end of the Roman Empire. She was two years old when the Portuguese started their colonial conquest by capturing some ports at the western coast of Morocco starting the year 1487. A few years later, Granada was falling into the hands of the Catholic Monarchs (los Reyes Católicos) Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon and with that, forced conversions of Muslims in Spain followed. Allied with the Turkish corsair Barbarossa of Algiers, al Hurra controlled the western Mediterranean Sea while Barbarossa controlled the eastern. She was also prefect of Tétouan. In 1515, she became the last person in Islamic history to legitimately hold the title of al Hurra (Queen) following the death of her husband, who ruled Tétouan. She later married the Berber King of Morocco, Ahmed al-Wattasi, but refused to leave Tétouan to do so. This marriage marks the only time in Moroccan history a king married away from the capital, Fez. Etymology The title Sayyida al Hurra means \\"noble lady who is free and independent; the woman sovereign who bows to no superior authority\\". Hakimat Tatwan means governor of Tétouan. Early life Sayyida al Hurra was born around 1485 (Hijri around 890) to a prominent Muslim family of Andalusian nobles who fled to Morocco after the fall of Grenada in 1492. She is a descendant of Sharif Abd as-Salam al-Alami, who is a descendant of Hasan ibn Ali. She fled with her family to Morocco when Ferdinand and Isabella conquered the Muslim kingdom of Granada in 1492, at the end of the Reconquista and settled in Chefchaouen. Sayyida's childhood was happy and secure, yet clouded by constant reminders of the forced exile from Granada. During her childhood, she was given a first-class education. She was fluent in several languages which included Castilian Spanish and Portuguese. The famous Moroccan scholar Abdallah al-Ghazwani was one of her many teachers. She was married at age 16 to a man 30 years her senior, a friend of her father and refounder and governor of the city of Tétouan, himself an Andalusian Moorish refugee, Ali al-Mandri, to whom she was promised when she was still a child. Some sources state she was married to al-Mandri's son, al-Mandri II. As Governor of Tétouan An intelligent woman, she learned much assisting her husband in his business affairs. She was a de facto vice-governor, with her husband entrusting the reins of power to her each time he made a trip outside the city. When the latter died in 1515, the population, who had become accustomed to seeing her exercise power, accepted her as a governor of Tétouan, giving her the title of al-Hurra. Spanish and Portuguese sources describe al-Hurra as \\"their partner in the diplomatic game\\". Some historians believe that the unusual \\"degree of acceptance of al Hurra as a ruler\\" could be attributed to \\"Andalusian familiarity with female inheriting power from monarch families in Spain such as Isabella I of Castile. Others believe that al Hurra succeeded as governor because she was \\"the undisputed leader of pirates of the western Mediterranean\\". In 1541, she accepted a marriage proposal from Ahmed al- Wattasi, a Sultan of the Moroccan Wattasid dynasty, who traveled from Fez to Tétouan to marry her. Her marriage with him was the only recorded instance of a Moroccan king marrying outside of his capital. This occurred because she was not ready to give up her role as queen of Tétouan or even to leave the city for the marriage ceremony, forcing al-Wattasi to come to her. It is believed that Sayyida insisted on this to show everybody that she was not going to give up governing Tétouan despite being married to the Sultan. Sayyida al Hurra lived a life of adventure and romance. She concurrently appointed her brother Moulay Ibrahim as vizier to Ahmed al-Wattasi, Sultan of Fez, and this placed the Rashids as major players in the effort to unify Morocco against the fast- growing powers of Spain and Portugal.. As a corsair Sayyida could neither forget nor forgive the humiliation of being forced to flee Granada. In her wish to avenge herself on the \\"Christian enemy\\", she turned to piracy. She made contact with the Ottoman pirate Barbarossa of Algiers. Piracy provided a quick income, \\"booty and ransom for captives\\", and also helped to keep alive the dream of returning to Andalusia. She was well respected by Christians as a queen who had power over the Mediterranean Sea. She also was the one with whom one had to negotiate the release of Portuguese and Spanish captives. For example, in The Forgotten Queens of Islam Fatima Mernissi mentions Spanish historical documents of 1540 according to which there were negotiations \\"between the Spaniards and Sayyida al-Hurra\\" after a successful pirating operation in Gibraltar in which the pirates took \\"much booty and many prisoners\\". Later life After she had ruled as queen for 30 years, her son- in-law Muhammad al-Hassan al-Mandri overthrew her in October 1542. According to the Yemen Times, \\"she was stripped of her property and power\\". Accepting her fate, she retired to Chefchaouen, where she lived nearly 20 years more.

The Corpus Christi Massacre or El Halconazo (The hawk strike, so called because of the participation of a government-trained paramilitary group known as Los Halcones) was a massacre of student demonstrators during the Mexican Dirty War in Mexico City on 10 June 1971, the day of the Corpus Christi festival. Nearly 120 protesters were killed, among them a fourteen- year-old boy. Background From his earliest days in office, President Luis Echeverría Álvarez announced intentions to reform democracy in Mexico. He immediately allowed some leaders of the 1968 student movement to return from exile in Chile and released many prisoners over the course of two years. In April 1971, the press spoke of coming reforms in education and soon figures such as José Revueltas and Heberto Castillo, both jailed for two and a half years, resurfaced in the political arena. Students were excited and thought they would have the opportunity to return to the streets to demonstrate discomfort against the government. The conflict at the University of Nuevo León gave them a reason to do so: At the end of 1970, teachers and university students presented a basic law that proposed a joint government, and in March 1971 Héctor Ulises arrived at the rectory under the new law. The state government disagreed and slashed the budget, which angered university officials and led to the University Council's passage of a new bill that virtually abolished the autonomy of the institution. The university went on strike and called for solidarity with other universities. The National Autonomous University of Mexico and National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) immediately responded and the students called for a massive rally in support of Nuevo León on June 10, 1971.Canal 6 de Julio, Halcones: State Terrorism On May 30 the governor of Nuevo León, Eduardo A. Elizondo Lozano, resigned as part of the settlement of the Ministry of Education. With the governor's resignation, by June 5, a new law came into force that resolved the conflict. Nevertheless, students decided to march even if the demands were not clear. The committee coordinating committee control (CoCo) was divided as there were those who thought that the march was useless and would only provoke the government. However, most people supported the law, arguing that there were many unresolved problems. It was also an opportunity for the government to show that it would not be as repressive as before. Days before the demonstration many police vehicles and cars started making regular runs near the Casco de Santo Tomás (one of the IPN's main campuses). June 10 The march started at the Casco de Santo Tomás, and proceeded through Carpio and Maestros Avenues so the protesters could take the Mexico-Tacuba Causeway, and eventually end up at Zócalo. The streets leading to the Maestros Avenue were blocked by police officers and riot police, who did not allow the students to pass. There were tankettes parked along Melchor Ocampo Avenue, near the military school, and riot police trucks in a large police contingent at the intersection of the Melchor Ocampo and San Cosme avenues. A shock group trained by the Federal Security Directorate and the CIA, known as \\"los Halcones\\", who came in grey trucks, vans, and riot trucks, attacked students from streets near Maestros Avenue after the riot police opened their blockade. The shock group first attacked with bamboo and kendo sticks so the students easily repelled them. Los Halcones then attacked the students again, with high-caliber rifles, while students tried, unsuccessfully, to hide. The police did not intervene because they had been ordered not to. The shooting lasted for several minutes, during which some cars gave logistical support to the paramilitary group. The support included extra weapons and makeshift transports, such as civilian cars, vans, police vehicles and an ambulance from the Cruz Verde (an organization similar to the Red Cross). The injured were taken to the general hospital Rubén Leñero, but to no avail, as the Halcones reached the hospital and killed them, while many were still in the operating room, and took the opportunity to scare the inmates. Nearly 120 protesters were killed, among them a fourteen-year-old boy. That night army elements guarded the National Palace and Luis Echeverría announced an investigation into the killing and said he would punish the guilty. Alfonso Martínez Domínguez, then-Mexico City governor, and , attorney general, denied that there were Halcones and police chief Escobar blamed the students for creating extremist groups within their movement. A week passed before Escobar accepted that there were Halcones, but denied their involvement in the massacre. The high number of journalists and photographers hit and arrested by Halcones managed to contradict the government's official version. Martínez Domínguez tendered his resignation on June 15 to Echeverría because he was convinced that the protesters had been provoked, among other things, so the government had an excuse to get rid of him. Despite this, Martínez Domínguez was known for many years as \\"Halconzo\\", in reference to the Corpus Thursday Massacre. The number of dead in the demonstration discouraged many students, but also led others to be radicalized, some of whom later formed urban guerrilla organizations. Students in 1971 especially demanded the democratization of education, control of the university budget by students and teachers, and that it represent 12% of the GDP. They also demanded political freedom wherein workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals could enjoy real democratic freedoms and control the social system; quality education for everyone, especially farmers and workers; greater respect for cultural diversity; strict democratic transparency; and support for the political union of the workers. Los Halcones Los Halcones (The Falcons) was a black operations army group that was trained by Federal Security Directorate. The group was created in the late 1960s to repress demonstrations and prevent other large popular movements such as the student movement of 1968 from rising again. Their first attack against the students took place on October 2, 1969, a year after the Tlatelolco Massacre. Their ostensible duty, as the government informed the public, who were not aware of their name or purpose, was to ensure the security of the recently inaugurated Metro. Members of Los Halcones were identified with nicknames and were of various backgrounds, including sports clubs, the police, and thugs for hire (known as \\"porros\\") who were provocateurs created to counter and watch universities. After the Halconazo, the number of Los Halcones members increased exponentially in the UNAM and IPN militaries, who were referred to with the nicknames \\"maestros\\" (teachers) or \\"paisanos\\" (countrymen). These militaries had at their command dozens of halcones, the vast majority of whom had participated in the Tlatelolco massacre, as well as gang members and criminals. The latter were released from jail under the condition that they form part of the new shock group with payment. Legal case In 2005, there was discussion in Mexico as whether the statute of limitations for the crimes committed in the Corpus Christi Massacre had expired or the criminals could still be judged responsible. On 29 November 2006, Luis Echeverría Álvarez pleaded guilty and was put on house arrest. In 2009 he was exonerated on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence against him to support the charge of genocide. In fiction Mexican filmmaker Gabriel Retes produced, directed, and acted in a film titled El Bulto (The lump), where he portrays Lauro, a photojournalist, who was attacked by a Los Halcones member and left in a coma. The massacre is featured in the 2018 film Roma.

It is one of the tractates forming Seder Kodashim (Hebrew סדר קודשים, \\"Order of Holy Things\\"). The primary focus of the tractate relates to the ritual sacrifice (or slaughter) of first-born animals. Priests were required to inspect the first-born for blemishes prior to consecration. These blemishes are enumerated in both the Mishnah and Tosefta. An exemption is made for the first-born son, who is \\"redeemed\\" in the Pidyon haben ceremony. Mishna The tractate contains nine chapters: * Chapter 1 on the first-born donkey (Petter Chamor) * Chapters 2-6 on the first-born of kosher cattle (calf, lamb, or kid): cases of exemption through partnership with a non-Jew (chapter 2); cases of doubt whether an animal is first-born or not (3); on first-born cattle having a blemish (4); on cases of blemishes willfully caused by the owner (5); a list of blemishes (6). * Chapter 7 on the first-born son and laws of his redemption (Pidyon haben). * Chapter 8 on blemishes that disqualify a priest for the sacrificial service * Chapter 9 on laws concerning the animal tithe—a subject which has many things in common with the \\"first-born\\" (see Zevahim 5:8). Besides chapters 7 and 9, there are a few digressions in the tractate. 1:7 speaks of the option between redeeming the first-born donkey and killing it, and recommends the former course; a few parallels are then introduced of option between two courses, of which one is recommended. The examination of the blemishes of the first-born animal had to be done gratis (4:5,6), but an exception is made in favor of a professional veterinary surgeon, such as Ila (or Ayla; in Tosefta Bekhorot 4:11, Amlah). In the same chapter another veterinary authority is named: Theodos the physician (4:4). To take payment for giving a decision in religious matters was considered unlawful and it rendered the decision invalid (4:6). When unqualified persons caused loss through their decision, they had to compensate for the loss; not so in the case of qualified persons (4:4). Transfer of property is generally reversed in the Jubilee year; but what the first-born obtains by his birthright remains his forever. Parallel cases are given in 8:10. Tosefta In the Tosefta the treatise Bekorot has likewise the fourth place, and is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 corresponds to the first chapter of the Mishnah; chapter 2 to 2-3; chapter 3 to 4-5; chapter 4 to 6; chapter 5 to 7; chapter 6 to 8; chapter 7 to 9. The Tosefta differs greatly from the Mishnah in the enumeration of the blemishes and in their names. In addition to names of blemishes, the Tosefta expands on different scenarios in which a Kohen may find himself when determining the status of a first-born, for example when a creature gives birth to an animal resembling another species. Talmud The Jerusalem Talmud does not contain a tractate Bekhorot. The Babylonian Talmud contains such a tractate, where it has the third place in the Seder. In addition to the common theme of purity, the Babylonian Talmud expands on the exemption of the first-born Levite, or Kohen. The child of a Levite mother, or Kohenim, regardless whether or not the father is a Levite or Israelite, is automatically exempt from the \\"toll\\". This exemption is due to the notion that first-born males are already born in the service of God thus redemption is not needed.

Spring (July 25, 1800 – January 17, 1892) was an American merchant and religious leader. He had a profound impact on Presbyterianism in the Northwest Territory, helping to establish at least six churches in Iowa and Illinois, and acted as a delegate in the General Assembly of 1861, which voted on the Gardiner Spring Resolutions and thus gave the assent of the Presbyterian Church to Abraham Lincoln's moves to keep the Union together. Early life in the East Charles A. Spring was the second youngest of the children of the Rev. Samuel Spring, Sr., the Revolutionary War chaplain of Benedict Arnold's army. Born in the Manse of the Congregationalist Church in Newburyport, Massachusetts on July 25, 1800, he was a descendant of Rev. Solomon Stoddard, a brother of Rev. Gardiner Spring, and a relative of Rev. Jonathan Edwards and Vice-President Aaron Burr. After his father's death in 1819, Charles moved south to Boston, and went to work as a merchant, dealing in silk goods and textiles. In 1823, he married Dorothy B. Norton of Maine. Three of their children were born in Boston: Frances Eliza, Charles A. Spring, Jr., and Winthrop Norton. Sometime before 1830, the family moved to Brooklyn, where daughters Edwina and Gertrude, as well as son George Hopkins, were born. Life in the Old Northwest In 1837, the Springs went west as part of the Great Migration, and settled first at Rock Island, Illinois on the Mississippi River. At the time, the journey from New York to Illinois took one month, and was made by the way of the Erie Canal and then the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Charles helped lay out and survey the town of Rock Island, where he settled into farming. By the 1840s, he was an elder in the Presbyterian Church in Rock Island, and was the sole layman on the committee that organized, in November 1844, the First Presbyterian Church of Sterling, Illinois. The Spring farm at Rock Island, in 1850, was spread over 100 acres, and had in the way of livestock 2 horses, 16 milch cows, 20 other cattle, and 20 swine, which produced 400 lbs of butter. The produce included 1600 bushels of Indian Corn, 100 bu. of oats, 100 of Irish potatoes, 20 of sweet potatoes, and 50 tons of hay. By 1851, Charles Spring and family had moved to Chicago; in November of that year, his wife Dorothy died. Charles pere et fils went into the boot and shoe business under the name C. A. Spring & Sons, locating at 188 Lake St. They lived in Hyde Park for a time, but by 1855 were in West Chicago, living on Fulton between Union and Halsted. By 1858, Charles took to farming again in Manteno, just south of Chicago. Relationship with Cyrus McCormick and church work While in Chicago, Charles Sr. became superintendent of the Sunday school at the North Presbyterian Church, and there met the inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick, whose mechanized reaper did for the Midwest what the cotton gin had done for the South. The two remained close friends and kept up an extensive correspondence until McCormick's death in 1884. Spring and McCormick established the South Church in what is now The Loop in Chicago, although they returned to the North Church when they were able to retain their favoured pastor, Rev. Dr. Nathan Rice. During the 1850s, Charles was instrumental in the founding of what eventually became the McCormick Theological Seminary. McCormick was a conservative Democrat who had been born in Virginia, and although he was no apologist for slavery, was intent on holding together both the Old School Presbyterian Church and the Union (he considered the Presbyterian Church and the Democratic Party to be the “two hoops that hold the barrel of the Union together.\\" McCormick thus set his sights on securing a seminary which would advance orthodox Presybyterian doctrine. An Indiana seminary was in dire straits, and when the General Assembly met in Indianapolis in 1859 to discuss its future, McCormick, acting through Spring (who was a delegate), offered the seminary an endowment of $100,000 on the condition that the Seminary locate in Chicago and that the General Assembly take control of it from the synods. This was an offer that the General Assembly couldn't refuse, and so the Seminary found its new home in Chicago. Charles A. Spring was also instrumental in gaining the donation of some of the land for the seminary, from the brewers Lill & Diversey. He sat on the Seminary's Board of Directors from 1859 to 1876 (when he relocated to Western Iowa). In an 1872 letter, McCormick gave his friend Spring the credit for the founding of the seminary, referring to Spring as “the most aged and experienced of us all, and to whom I was myself indebted for the original suggestion and advice to make the donation to this cause\\", the seminary. In 1859, Charles guided the creation of the First Presbyterian Church of Manteno, Illinois, securing a donation from McCormick which funded nearly half of the amount necessary for the building of the church. In 1866, he gave the parsonage as a gift (it burned down soon after his death, in 1895). In 1861, Charles was a delegate to the Presbyterian General Assembly in Philadelphia which considered the Gardiner Spring Resolutions propounded by his brother, Rev. Gardiner Spring, of New York City. The assembly finally approved the resolutions, which meant the church would stand behind Abraham Lincoln's attempts to keep the Union intact. In 1865, Spring cared for William Sanderson McCormick, the inventor's brother and partner, during his long illness. When William died that fall, Charles A. Spring, Jr. took over the management of the McCormick Co., as well as McCormick's extensive real estate holdings. The elder Spring often helped his son in this, especially during the busy spring leasing season. Charles Sr. repeatedly tried to convince McCormick to carry out one of William's last wishes, which was to found a home for young girls (age 5-10) to save them from “destructive Parental & other influence” and to clothe, feed, and educate them in a religious environment. Charles himself had successfully petitioned the Chicago City Council to set aside funds to establish the Chicago Reform School for Boys, one of the first of its kind in the nation. According to Hutchinson, McCormick's biographer, Charles believed that “too much emphasis was placed upon punishment, and not enough upon the prevention of crime. Later life By 1868, Charles's eyesight was failing, but he was still farming, living most of the year with his daughters Edwina and Frances and sons George and Winthrop in Manteno. As he wrote C. H. McCormick in May 1865, he spent his days “raising strawberries and grandchildren.\\" In 1877–1878, Charles retired and moved to Le Mars, Iowa, where his son Winthrop worked as a McCormick reaper agent, his son George owned a hardware company, and where his daughter Edwina soon married Byron Mudge, a Civil War pensioner. He lived with the Mudges for the last 15 years of his life. He stayed quite active in his old age. In 1884, at the age of 84, Charles caught a white Pacific crane on the Arkansas River which measured 6 feet and 4 inches from beak to toes. It was reported by the Le Mars Sentinel, and went on exhibition in Le Mars. Charles A. Spring, Sr., died on January 17, 1892, at the age of 91, from complications of 'la grippe' (influenza). His obituary in the Le Mars Sentinel spoke of his many passions. He was a member of the American Sunday School Union, and labored for many years for the American Tract Society, “building school houses as places of worship in different needy localities.” Descendants Charles's eldest son, Charles A. Spring Jr., was Cyrus McCormick's most trusted adviser, and general manager of the McCormick plant for many years. His second eldest son, Winthrop, along with Winthrop's wife, daughter, and daughter-in-law, all died in the catastrophic Iroquois Theatre Fire in Chicago in 1903. His grandson, Dr. Samuel Newton Spring, was a noted forestry professor at Yale and Cornell, Dean of the New York State forestry department, and was a correspondent and friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His great-great-grandson, Charles A. Spring IV, was a bridge engineer for United States Steel in Pittsburgh.

The battle itself took place as part of the larger IDF- launched Operation Abiray-Lev, in an attempt to seize Ismailia and thereby sever the logistical and supply lines of most of Egypt's Second Field Army across the Suez Canal. Breaking out of their newly established bridgehead west of the Canal at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake, the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia. A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle, falling back upon defensive positions further north under increasing pressure from IDF infantry and armor. By October 22, they were occupying a last line of defense, including positions along the Ismailia canal. Though outnumbered, they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed, bringing the battle to an end. The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia, stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open. Background Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal at the beginning of the war On October 6, 1973, Egypt launched Operation Badr, which started the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads on the east bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front had come to a lull.Hammad (2002), pp.85–200Gawrych (1996), pp.27–55 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians. The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.Hammad (2002), pp.237–276Gawrych (1996), pp.55–57Dupuy (2002), pp.485–490 The failed Egyptian offensive gave the initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in what became known as the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.Hammad (2002), pp.293–412, 435–436Gawrych (1996), pp.59–65 Prelude Ariel Sharon, commander of 143rd Armored Division and future Prime Minsiter The west bank of the canal was lined with a series of ramparts up to high, which the Egyptians referred to as \\"strong points\\". These were used during the opening days of the war to allow Egyptian forces to directly fire on the Israelis on the east bank. There were five strong points between the Great Bitter Lake and the Ismailia Canal, from north to south: a pumping station at Deversoir, the village of Serabaeum, Touscan, Heneidac and Jebel Mariam.Hammad (2002), pp.426–428 The area was largely agricultural, intersected with dikes and irrigation ditches, although these did not present significant obstacles. There were several villages and numerous farms, especially orchards of mango and orange trees. The density of foliage made the terrain unsuitable for vehicles. The Israelis called it the \\"jungle\\" or \\"Vietnam\\".O'Ballance (1997), p.229 West of the Suez Canal, and running parallel to it, was the Sweetwater Canal, which distributed freshwater to the inhabitants of the canal zone and its cities. It branched from the Ismailia Canal, running east from the Nile River near Cairo to Lake Timsah at Ismailia. There were four bridges across the Ismailia Canal. The first was the Abu Gamus Bridge at Ismailia. Two bridges, one railroad and one vehicular, were located at the village of Nafisha, on the western outskirts of Ismailia. Further west was the Upper Bridge, as it was called.Hammad (2002), p.559 Engineers had wired the bridges with demolition charges for destruction should they fall to the Israelis. Second Army's reserve included the 10th and 118th Mechanized Infantry Brigades, with the latter occupying a series of fortified defenses on the northern bank of the Ismailia Canal.Hammad (2002), p.438 Ismail Azmy, commander of the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade The 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, comprising the 81st, 85th and 89th Battalions (each composed of three companies) under the command of Colonel Ismail Azmy, was assigned responsibility for defending the area south of Ismailia against an Israeli offensive. Azmy arrived at Nafisha with the bulk of his brigade at midnight on October 17, where he was briefed by Brigadier General Abd el-Munim Khalil, commander of Second Army. Khalil identified the west bank strong points as objectives for the paratroopers to secure, as the ramparts could be used to provide fire support to Egyptian forces on the east bank. The paratroopers would also hold Serabaeum and the bridges there over the Sweetwater Canal.O'Ballance (1997), p.235 The 85th Paratrooper Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel 'Atef Monsif, had been involved in a recent counter-attack against Deversoir. Despite breaking through in certain areas and even seizing part of the airstrip at Deversoir, the paratroopers and their supporting armor were greatly outnumbered and the counter-attack failed. The battalion suffered around a hundred dead, missing or wounded, and by dawn on October 18 it had been pulled back to Inshas Military Base for reorganizing. The only other Egyptian forces in the area were commandos, the 73rd Battalion of the 129th Sa'iqa (lightning) Group. The Sa'iqa had also been engaged in heavy fighting at Serabaeum, Deversoir and the nearby military base of Abu Sultan. By late October 17, the battalion's two companies had been ordered to withdraw from the vicinity of Deversoir northward to defend Serabaeum.Hammad (2002), pp.429–430, 432–433Gawrych (2000), p.220O'Ballance (1997), p.236 On October 18, Sharon's division across the canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez. Sharon, wanting to expand the Israeli bridgehead northward, received permission to cross a third unit, an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef, to the west bank, and did so on October 19. The paratroopers and part of the armor had been holding the Israeli bridgehead since October 16, facing little resistance, while Reshef's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements.Hammad (2002), p.436Dupuy (2002), p.527 Battle =First day= IDF tanks from Sharon's division during the battle. The battle was mostly fought over agricultural areas and farmlands, as opposed to the desert terrain of the Sinai. On the morning of October 18, Israeli paratroopers began their first push northward. Sharon ordered the attack, even though he had not yet received permission to launch an offensive in that direction. An Israeli battalion moved toward Serabaeum, spearheaded by a company mounted in half-tracks. The village was then occupied by a company of the 73rd Sa'iqa battalion, and the defenders received a platoon of reinforcements to compensate losses. The Israelis began receiving fire as they approached the town, but the battalion commander decided to push ahead. As they entered the village, they encountered heavy resistance, and the lead half-track was cut off. Fourteen men including the company commander, Captain Asa Kadmoni, managed to take cover in one of the houses. Kadmoni took up a position covering several approaches and, with ammunition passed on to him by others, held his position for over three hours, engaging the Egyptians at ranges of to , hitting their positions with his LAW anti-tank weapon. Other paratroopers with armor managed to reach the unit and retrieve them, before the Israelis withdrew under Egyptian pressure. The paratroopers suffered 11 killed and 27 wounded in the attack. Kadmoni would be awarded the Medal of Valor for his performance that day.Dupuy (2002), pp.527–528Hammad (2002), pp.429–430O'Ballance (1997), p.238 The Sa'iqa battalion's other company was occupying positions just north of Abu Sultan. Despite receiving the order to retreat during the night of October 17–18, the Egyptians were heavily outnumbered and the intensity of the fighting prevented them from withdrawing from their positions. Consequently, Heikal ordered artillery barrages on the area, including the Sa'iqa company's position, inadvertently leading to friendly-fire casualties. Soon after the firing subsided, Israeli paratroopers attacked at morning, and severe fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, ensued. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but the Sa'iqa held its position. At night, both companies retreated. The 73rd Battalion sustained 85 casualties, including 11 officers, throughout the fighting on October 18, and subsequently was withdrawn to be reconstituted.Hammad (2002), pp.430–431 An Israeli soldier on the road to Ismailia That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved south to their objectives, reaching them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station. The commander made the mistake of separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being directed against the bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis until the end of the war.O'Ballance (1997), pp.235–236Hammad (2002), pp.428–429 The accuracy of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.Hammad (2002), p.429 During the afternoon that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought to assess the situation and to work with Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti-tank weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking anti-tank weapons; it had been stripped of its anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the east bank.Hammad (2002), pp.433–435Gawrych (2000), pp.220, 223 Several measures decided upon were not implemented however. =Second day= Israeli soldiers during the battle. One of them has the Soviet-made RPG-7 by his side. Amnon Reshef's armored brigade completed its crossing that morning, and joined Sharon's division, just as the latter received actual approval to begin an offensive toward Ismailia. In the meantime, the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at Inshas Base and returned to Ismailia, where it was placed under Azmy's command once again.Hammad (2002), pp.544, 436Dupuy (2002), p.528 The 129th Sa'iqa Group retreated to Abu Suweir, north of Ismailia, to reorganize, and Heikal was also informed of his group's new area of operations, with the objective of defending the Upper Bridge, and the crucial Cairo-Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge.Hammad (2002), pp.552–553 Sharon ordered Matt to push northward to Serabaeum again, where paratroopers of the 81st Battalion were occupying defenses. The attack failed once more, and Sharon now sent Reshef on Matt's left flank. Using a battalion of some thirty tanks with mechanized infantry, Reshef used his superior maneuverability to flank the Egyptian position. There was heavy, close-quarter fighting in the trenches, and extra units were brought up against the Orcha position. The paratroopers reported their defenses to have been penetrated during the afternoon, and they later withdrew after detonating the bridges over the Sweetwater Canal at Serabaeum. The Israelis captured Egyptian positions in the area, and discovered that Orcha Hill contained a major Egyptian radio intercept station. The capture of Orcha caused the collapse of Egyptian defenses in the area; the paratroopers pulled back to the village of Ain Ghasin five kilometres north, and Azmy ordered the 89th Battalion to withdraw to the adjacent Touscan strong point, abandoning the ramparts at Serabaeum. These were occupied by the Israelis, which they used to fire on Egyptian positions across the canal. The Egyptians hastily organised defenses at Touscan.O'Ballance (1997), p.243Hammad (2002), pp.545-546 This new line of defenses was just over 12 kilometres south of Ismailia.Hammad (2002), p.558 Meanwhile, Egyptian General Headquarters (GHQ) in Cairo, sent the 139th Sa'iqa Group with its two battalions to Ismailia. They were given the objective of eliminating Israeli forces up to the Deversoir area and destroying Israeli bridges across the Suez Canal. A team of frogmen was attached for that end, and the group had no armor or heavy weaponry, and their only transports were large military trucks. GHQ did not include Second Army command in any of the planning, and in fact only notified Second Army of the operation on the morning of October 19, when the Sa'iqa Group had already begun moving to Ismailia from Cairo. This alarmed Second Army command, and Khalil ordered military police to stop the 139th Sa'iqa Group's vehicles at Abu Suweir, and have its commander, Colonel Osama Ibrahim, arrive at his headquarters in Ismailia. Ibrahim arrived that evening and met Khalil and Shazly. Both men were shocked when they learned of Ibrahim's objectives, imaginary as they were and impossible to achieve, an indication of the state of confusion in GHQ at the time. Khalil canceled the entire operation and placed the Sa'iqa unit under Second Army's command instead, and Ibrahim in turn notified GHQ of his new orders. By midnight he was at Khalil's headquarters once more, where he was informed GHQ's reply: Ibrahim would proceed with his original mission.Hammad (2002), pp.554–556 =Third and fourth days= Sa'iqa Group. Starting at sunrise on October 20, the Israeli Air Force launched aerial attacks for the duration of the day, targeting Ismailia, the nearby al-Galaa' army base, and Jebel Mariam. Close air support was also provided to advancing ground forces. Israeli aircraft employed ordnance fitted with time fuses, as well as napalm to demoralize Egyptian troops.Hammad (2002), p.557 Shazly left Ismailia that evening, returning to Cairo where he presented a grim evaluation of the military situation to GHQ. His recommendation to withdraw armored forces to counter the Israeli threat on the west bank created a serious command crisis, and ultimately no withdrawal took place.Gawrych (2000), pp.223–224 Sharon renewed his division's attack that day, moving north from Serabaeum on a three brigade front, with Matt on the right, Erez in the center, and Reshef on the left. The advance spanned the entire area between the Suez Canal on the east and the Sweetwater Canal on the west. By dawn, both Touscan and Ain Ghasin were under attack. The 89th Battalion had concentrated all its forces at the Touscan strong point, where it was hard-pressed by superior Israeli armored and mechanized forces. Azmy reported the situation to Second Army headquarters, and requested permission to detonate a nearby bridge on the Sweetwater Canal and flood the area before the advancing Israelis. Khalil however issued strict orders not to do so, since the canal was a crucial source of drinking water to civilians all the way up to Suez city. The situation was deteriorating for the paratroopers however, and Azmy soon had the bridge destroyed and broke down sections of nearby irrigation canals, flooding the entire area and submerging Israeli tanks up to their hulls in muddy water. This led to the paratroopers of Matt's brigade spearheading the advance in the center instead, while the armored brigades were forced to have their mechanized infantry push ahead on foot. The Touscan position remained under heavy air and artillery attack, and by midday it was surrounded. Losses due to death and injury left the battalion with some 120 paratroopers still able to fight.Hammad (2002), pp.550–551O'Ballance (1997), p.242 Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion was able to hold Ain Ghasin until the afternoon, when it retreated to Nefisha. As for the reconstituted 85th Battalion, it was ordered to occupy Jebel Mariam, Heneidac and Touscan. The battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Monsif, found during a reconnaissance that Touscan was surrounded by large Israeli forces and under heavy fire, and so limited his battalion's defenses to Jebel Mariam and Heneidac only, occupying the former with the battalion's main forces, including two companies of paratroopers, and placing a single company at Heneidac.Hammad (2002), pp.551–552 The 139th Sa'iqa Group, having had its mission confirmed by GHQ, began moving southward from Ismailia at sunset. Both battalions advanced in columns, each pushing a company ahead as a vanguard. Col. Ibrahim sent four patrols ahead to reconnoitre, and only one returned; the rest were considered missing. As the Sa'iqa group moved south, they encountered groups of Egyptian paratroopers from the 81st and 89th Battalions, retreating northward under Israeli pressure. When the unit neared Ain Ghasin they were ambushed by an Israeli force. An intense firefight took place as the vanguard engaged the Israelis, after some of their transports had been hit. Soldiers disembarked their vehicles and took cover in nearby farms and orchards. The vehicles and transports were turned back with great difficulty, and the entire Sa'iqa group soon began to retreat to a position south of the village of Abu 'Atwa, itself roughly 3 kilometres south of Ismailia. Ibrahim called for artillery support, but the Israelis were jamming and interfering his radio net, and communicated with him in Arabic. This led to Israeli artillery fire falling on his forces instead. The Egyptians suffered few casualties though, due to the density of the mango trees, which minimized the hit radius of artillery rounds and provided cover from shrapnel.Hammad (2002), pp.556–557 Retreat to Ismailia Canal An Israeli Mirage, shot down over the west bank of the canal during the battle. Meanwhile, Heikal was able to contact Ibrahim and asked him to arrive at headquarters in Ismailia due to a change in orders, and he arrived sometime after midnight. Khalil had managed, after a lengthy and drawn-out conversation, to convince GHQ to cancel the operation and place the 139th Sa'iqa Group under his command to assist in fortifying Ismailia instead of sacrificing the elite force in a suicidal mission, and GHQ finally acquiesced. Ibrahim was now tasked with occupying and defending Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. He reorganized his force, and occupied both villages with a battalion each by dawn on October 21. Despite the near-debacle, the commitment of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.O'Ballance (1997), p.247 Azmy lost contact with the 89th Battalion during the night, due to the intensity of Israeli bombardment on Touscan. At morning on October 21 the Israelis attacked again, and the paratroopers managed to repulse the attack again, before falling back. By dusk the battalion had abandoned the Touscan strong point and managed to retreat northward. Azmy had the 81st and 89th Battalions pulled back to the Ismailia Stadium, where they were to be reconstituted. The Israelis also attacked Heneidac at dawn that day using armor and infantry with air and artillery support, and captured the position before noon. The paratrooper company there pulled back north and joined the rest of the 85th Battalion at Jebel Mariam, now the only defensive position occupied by the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, and the last position on the Suez Canal before Ismailia. Israeli command conflict During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, the heads of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, continued to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He retorted with the claim that had it not been for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by now. When his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the east bank. As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.Gawrych (2000), p.226Dupuy, pp.528–529Hammad (2002), pp.558-559O'Ballance (1997), pp.248–249 =Fifth day= Egyptian preparations An Egyptian Sa'iqa looks at a group of knocked out Israeli Pattons in the village of Abu 'Atwa, near Ismailia. With Egyptian forces occupying a final line of defense, Khalil focused on preventing any Israeli crossing of the Ismailia Canal. To this end, he concentrated a large amount of firepower from various artillery units. Following the Israeli crossing, Brigadier General Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala, commander of Second Army artillery, had managed to reorganize around ten artillery battalions in fire bases north of the Ismailia Canal, and incorporated the divisional artillery of Egyptian units on the east bank of the Suez Canal – an additional eight battalions. Abu Gazala thus had at his disposal between 12 and 16 battalions available for a single barrage incorporating a total of some 280 artillery guns. He also organized anti-tank defenses, emplacing eight Sagger launchers at the easternmost Upper Bridge, and allocating six BRDMs with Sagger launchers.Hammad (2002), pp.561–563 The 118th Mechanized Infantry Brigade was assigned positions occupying the bridges of the Ismailia Canal, and was to defend the city and nearby al-Galaa' army base. The 85th Paratrooper Battalion was directly ordered by Khalil to \\"hold Jebel Mariam to the last bullet and the last man\\", due to its critical importance and dominance, overlooking Ismailia itself and the main approaches to the city. In addition to Second Army's supporting artillery, the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade's 120 mm mortar battalion, with eighteen mortars, was attached to the paratroopers at Jebel Mariam, significantly increasing their firepower. As for the 139th Sa'iqa Group, its two battalions occupied Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha, and a company from the battalion at Nefisha was kept in reserve. While preparing defenses, the Sa'iqa were confronted with huge numbers of civilians, mainly farmers, fleeing northward with as many belongings and livestock as possible, cluttering and blocking roads.Hammad (2002), pp.563–564 Final Israeli attack Egyptian soldiers gather Israeli soldiers' bodies killed during the Battle of Ismailia. Throughout the night of October 21/22, the large artillery forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis. The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack, especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin, as well likely routes of attack, and continued to provide a withering fire support during the Israeli attack.Hammad (2002), pp.562, 564 At morning, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, concentrating on Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa, Nefisha, and al-Galaa' base, and at noon they destroyed the Abu Gamoos Bridge at Ismailia. At this time, company- sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were repelled by Sagger missiles.Hammad (2002), p.566 At around 10:00 am, the Israelis renewed the attack, moving toward Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense fighting but, with their advantageous position, were able to repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00 pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks. At the same time, two tank companies and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support. The Egyptian commando battalion in charge of Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed to very short distances. The Israelis lost three tanks, two half-tracks, and a large number of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal.O'Ballance (1997), p.249 The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed.Dupuy (2002), p.529 Aftermath The Battle of Ismailia Monument in Ismailia, Egypt, a concrete monument in the form of an AK-47 with bayonet, a gift from North Korea to Egypt commemorating the casualties of the Battle of Ismailia in which North Korea allied with Egypt against Israel. With nightfall, the ceasefire imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 came into effect at 6:52 pm, ending the battle. A large number of Israeli wounded were still on the battlefield. Sharon requested helicopters to evacuate the wounded, but Bar-Lev replied in the negative, as it was dark and too risky to land helicopters near the battlefield. The Israelis worked to extract the wounded from the battlefield anyway, and the rescue operations took some four hours before most of the wounded were finally evacuated. When sunrise arrived, Israeli paratroopers and Egyptian Sa'iqa sometimes found that there were no more than 20 meters separating their positions, but the ceasefire held.Hammad (2002), p.567O'Ballance (1997), p.262 The combined Egyptian paratrooper-commando force managed to achieve a tactical and strategic victory at a time when Egypt's general situation on the battlefield was deteriorating, and GHQ was in a state of confusion. Sharon's advance toward Ismailia had been halted, and Second Army's logistical lines remained secure.Gawrych (1996), p.73Gawrych (2000), pp.220, 231 While the Egyptians attribute their successful defense of the city to their staunch resistance, Sharon would remain adamant after the war that he had failed to capture Ismailia due to Southern Command's interference. Sharon – who was a member of the political opposition in Israel – insisted that political issues played into hampering his advance against Ismailia. Sharon would frequently encourage his men by telling them \\"The secretary of the Likud Party is here with you.\\" Ismail Azmy's decision to detonate a bridge over the Sweetwater Canal on October 20 in order to stall an Israeli attack, in violation of direct orders not to do so, led to him being relieved of his command on October 25, three days after the ceasefire.Hammad (2002), p.551 Captain Asa Kadmoni, who was awarded Israel's highest military decoration for his actions on October 18, later returned his medal as a protest against his government's defense policy. =Post cease-fire reconciliation= Israeli journalist Abraham Rabinovich, in his account of the Yom Kippur War, writes that despite being involved in intense fighting for several days, the Egyptian and Israeli soldiers in the Ismailia sector who survived the battle were among the first to reconcile, even when the first ceasefire was broken in the south and fighting resumed. On the morning of October 23, an Israeli paratroop company under Captain Gideon Shamir was deploying near the Ismailia Canal, when Shamir saw Egyptian commandos, probably from the unit he had engaged the night before, encamped in an orchard less than 100 meters away. Wishing to ensure there would be no more killing in his sector, Shamir instructed his men to cover him and, taking a soldier who spoke Arabic, went to the commandos, shouting \\"Cease-fire, peace\\" so as not to surprise the Egyptians. The commandos held their fire as the two Israelis presented themselves, and soon summoned their company commander, who identified himself as Major Ali.Rabinovich (2004), pp.513–515. Both men agreed to avoid shooting, and to avoid getting anyone on either side hurt. Ali even surprised Shamir by predicting that Sadat wanted peace with Israel, not just a cease-fire. In coming days, soldiers from both sides would come out to the clearing between their positions and fraternized. When shooting erupted in nearby sectors, they would return to their respective positions. Initially, the Egyptians would fire if it was nighttime, but the Israelis held their fire, and soon the Egyptians stopped firing as well. Soon, the commandos and paratroopers would meet daily, drinking coffee, playing backgammon and soccer, getting to personally know each other, and occasionally holding a kumzits, with the Egyptians slaughtering a sheep and the Israelis presenting food parcels sent from home. The example set by the Egyptians and Israelis here was soon emulated in other sectors, and even Sharon came to see for himself the \\"local armistice\\" that had taken place. At one point, two officers came with Ali to meet with Shamir and said they hoped relations between Egypt and Israel would come to match the relations between Shamir's and Ali's men.

Cup with the Wanderers in 1872 and played for the English XI against Scotland in the representative matches between 1870 and 1872. By profession, he was a merchant in India. Family and education Crake was born in Madras, India where his father had been in business. He was educated at Harrow School between 1866 and 1870. At Harrow, he was a member of the school football team in 1868 and 1869; he also played cricket for the school in his last two years. On 2 April 1881, he married Emily Noble Chase in Madras; they had two sons: *Ralph Hamilton Crake (1882–1952), who became a Lieutenant Colonel in the King's Own Scottish Borderers and was awarded the D.S.O.. He played two first- class cricket matches, the first in 1901 and the last in 1921. *Eric Hamilton Crake (1886–1948), who made one first-class cricket appearance for M.C.C. in 1912. Football career He played football for several clubs, including the Barnes Club, Harrow Chequers and the Wanderers. He played as a forward and was described in the 1873 Football Annual as \\"a very neat dribbler, slow but certain\\" and \\"very useful on the side\\". He made his debut for the Wanderers on 5 January 1870 at Crystal Palace, having been introduced to the club by E. E. Bowen, a master at Harrow School. In March 1870, he and Bowen were selected for the first unofficial international match between an English XI and a team representing Scotland, which had been arranged by another Old Harrovian, C. W. Alcock. One match report said that Crake \\"deserved no little praise for the energy of [his] following-up throughout the game\\". He also played for England in the matches played in November 1870 and February 1871 (listed as a member of the Barnes Club) and November 1871 (now with Harrow Chequers). In 1871, Wanderers were one of 15 clubs who entered the inaugural FA Cup competition. Wanderers reached the final where they met a side from the Royal Engineers. Crake played as one of eight forwards as Wanderers claimed the trophy for the first of five times, with the single goal coming from Morton Betts. Crake continued to play for the Wanderers until 1874, making a total of 23 appearances with three goals. Cricket career Crake was a keen cricketer who played for various clubs, including M.C.C. and the Free Foresters. In June 1868, aged 16, he played for the M.C.C. against his own school. Professional career By the end of the 1870s, Crake had returned to India and set up as a merchant. Following his retirement in 1892, he returned to England to live in Norfolk Crescent, near Hyde Park, London where he died on 1 December 1921, aged 69. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

History In February and March 1857, the towns of Crailsheim, Heilbronn, Künzelsau and Weinsberg petitioned the King and the Estates of Württemberg to be linked by a railway. In April, the Wurttemberg Chamber of Deputies recommended the construction of a railway line on the Heilbronn–Crailsheim–Nuremberg route. In May 1858, the Estates supported a route via Weinsberg and Öhringen to Crailsheim. This variant, proposed at a formal meeting of the Oberamt (district) of Weinsberg and by the people of the Weinberg valley, was the longest of three considered and, because it required the construction of the 891 m long Weinberg tunnel between Heilbronn and Weinberg, was much more expensive but had the advantage that all the major places in the Weinberg valley, including importantly Weinberg, could be connected to each other. The Heilbronn–Schwäbisch Hall section was opened on 4 August 1862 and the Schwäbisch Hall–Crailsheim section was opened on 10 December 1867. Planning and construction of the line were supervised by Carl Julius Abel. The original single-track line was duplicated between 1887 and 1890. In 1879 the Murr Valley Railway was connected to the Kocher Railway in the then neighboring town of Hessental rather than to Schwäbisch Hall station. This was disadvantageous for Schwäbisch Hall as a trip to Stuttgart required a detour via Hessental. As a result, Hessental station became more important than Schwäbisch Hall station, although it is 4 km from the city centre. Development as a Stadtbahn route  Since December 2005, the Heilbronn Stadtbahn has run on the Hohenlohe line to Öhringen-Cappel. This service operates as line S4 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. This section of the line was electrified for this service and eight new stations were built. To carry out this work at a lower cost the whole line between Öhringen and Heilbronn was closed between June 2003 and December 2005 and replaced by a bus service, avoiding the expenditure of €4 million, according to the DB. Despite this measure, there were repeated unplanned additional costs and delays in rebuilding the line. Even after the development of the line for the Stadtbahn, Deutsche Bahn still operates the route, through its subsidiary Westfrankenbahn, with Regional-Express services between Heilbronn and Crailsheim, as well as Regionalbahn services between Öhringen and Crailsheim (with a change in Schwäbisch Hall-Hessental). The Stadtbahn between Heilbronn and Öhringen is operated by Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft, using Stadtbahn electric multiple units of GT8-100C/2S and GT8-100D/2S-M classes. The Regional-Express services have used railcars of class 642 since December 2008 and Regionalbahn services between Öhringen and Schwäbisch Hall-Hessental continue to use class 628 diesel multiple units, which previously also ran between Heilbronn and Öhringen. Between Heilbronn and Öhringen there is and additional pair of locomotive-hauled trains in the morning rush hour. Freight  Since the re-opening of the line between Öhringen and Heilbronn in December 2005, wagons are shunted daily between the factory of the Öhringen packaging manufacturer Huber and Heilbronn. In addition, freight trains run between Crailsheim and Hessental on the Nuremberg–Kornwestheim marshalling yard (Stuttgart) route.  Heilbronn Stadtbahn inner city line  Between Heilbronn Trappensee and Heilbronn Karlstor stations the ramp to the Heilbronn Stadtbahn inner city line branches off. After the Stadtbahn stop in the forecourt of Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof, the Stadtbahn runs over a level crossing of the Franconia Railway on to the Kraichgau Railway to Karlsruhe. Patronage  According to surveys of Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft in 2008, 13,400 passengers use the Stadtbahn daily on the route between Heilbronn and Öhringen. The patronage of DB Regio was around 700 passengers a day; in 2002, before the launch of the Stadtbahn, it was 585. Future  An extension of Stadtbahn from Öhringen-Cappel to Waldenburg or Schwäbisch Hall is being considered. A connection to Künzelsau via Waldenburg was being examined in 2008.

Cheras was also known as Kothai. The capital of the Chera kingdom was Karur. This led historians such as Professor Joseph Mundasseri and Kanakasabhato to claim that Thrikkariyoor, a village 3 km north of Kothamangalam, could have been the ancient capital of Cheras. However, this claim did not receive wide support. It is believed that until the 8th century followers of Lord Buddha lived in Nellikuzhi area.

Ullíbarri marsh is the largest in the Basque Country (220 Hm 3) and plays a triple role, supplying water to Álava and Vizcaya, regulating river flow and serving as a recreational area, one of the most frequented in summer. The dam of the reservoir (gravity) is located between the villages of Ullíbarri and Arroyabe.  Construction dates  The construction of the dam between 1947 and 1950 completely changed the life and appearance of the people, because even if the center of the town (the church) and most of the houses narrowly escaped the reservoir, the majority of farmland was flooded, and residents had to reorient their activities mainly to farming or being forced to migrate to the city of Vitoria.

The view of the Basque Country from the landsat satellite The main natural limits of the Basque Country are the Cantabrian Sea (south Bay of Biscay) in the north and in the west side, and in the south side, the Ebro river. The highest point in the Basque Country is the Hiru Erregeen Mahaia peak (2438 m high). Coast The Butroe river joins the sea in Plentzia The coast of the Basque Country has three sides. The coast of Biscay is rough but in general there are big beaches. There are also at least two big estuaries, that of Ibaizabal (known also as the Ría de Bilbao) and Urdaibai. The coast of Gipuzkoa shows a more rugged terrain and in general the slopes are steeper. From the limit of Biscay to Zumaia there are smaller beaches and they are more rocky. East of Zumaia, they are larger and longer. When different rivers join the sea, small estuaries can be found (Oria), and in the others, maritime branches (Urumea, Bidasoa). The coast of Lapurdi is flatter. The beaches are longer and the slopes gentler. The rivers Bidasoa and Adour join the ocean in Lapurdi. Mountains The Aliutz mountain (Biscay) The Basque country is mountainous. Most of the mountains are along an east- west axis, at the west of the Pyrenees. The most important rock there is limestone, but there are also mountains composed of other materials. For example, Aiako Harria is composed of granite. The highest mountain is Hiru Errege Maila. The south of Álava and Navarre is the middle east limit of Cantabrian Mountains. There are mountains like Kodes and Toloño. Between those importants mountains there are Euskal mendiak: Urbasa, Andia, Aralar, Anboto, Ordunte or Aizkorri. Rivers The Ebro is the largest river which crosses the Basque Country. It is 910 km long, and flows along the southern boundary of the Basque Country before it joins the Mediterranean sea. On its way east, the Ebro harvests the water of a string of tributaries, such as Zadorra, Baias, Ega and Aragon. Aragon's course is the longest, at 192 km. The river rises in Astun, located in Aragon; it flows down past the Esa reservoir, and crosses thereafter eastern Navarre until it joins the river of Ebro. Aturri, which joins the sea in the coast of Basque Country, is the largest river and has the biggest water flow. Its source is in Tourmalet and it joins the sea in Baiona, crosses 335 km of land, the last 30 km of which are in Basque Country. It has several tributaries from the Pyrenees, including the Biduze, Errobi, and Aran. Like Aturri, other Basque rivers join the sea in the Bay of Biscay, such as Nerbioi, Bidasoa, Oria, Deba, Urola, and Urumea. The Nerbioi is the longest such river in the Basque Country, with a length of 75 km. Forests The forest of Irati is the largest in the Basque Country, and one of the main beech forests in Europe. It covers parts of Lower Navarre, Zuberoa and Spanish Navarre. Otherwise, from Sakana to Aezkoa extending all over the north of Navarre, deciduous forests abound. These breed of trees can be also found on the east of Álava, in the region called Mendialdea and Araialdea, and in Zuberoa and Lower Navarre. They exist in Gipuzkoa too, in the middle of Urola and in Aralar. In Biscay, there are evergreen forests throughout 66% of the province. The main exceptions of this are some places of Enkarterri and in Durango (Urkiola Natural Park). In Gipuzkoa, 56% of the trees there are conifers, but in Álava they consist of only 28% of the trees. Currently, 55% of Basque Country is covered by trees, and in Navarre the figure is 45%. Desert The natural park of Barde is the biggest desert, and is located in the south east of Navarre. It is 41.845 hectares in area. It is 45 km from north to south, and 24 km from west to east.

The electric car was to be the commercial implementation of the CityCar project developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab since 2003. The name Hiriko comes from the Basque word for \\"urban\\" or \\"from the city\\". Three versions were to be developed: the Fold microcar; the Alai, a convertible; and the Laga, a small truck. The Hiriko was to be designed specifically for short-distance urban carsharing programs and municipal fleets. A manufacturing trial aiming for 20 pre-production cars began in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, in July 2012. A pilot program was scheduled to take place in Germany in 2013 to integrate the Hiriko Fold into Deutsche Bahn's railway service to allow their customers the possibility of using a vehicle parked at the station with which to complete the last mile of the journey to their final destinations. Production was planned for the second quarter of 2013 with retail deliveries initially scheduled to begin in 2014, at a price starting at () plus battery leasing fees. In May 2013 the Hiriko consortium announced the project was having difficulties to continue with the commercial development phase due to lack of financing. Sixteen months after the January 2012 debut of the Hiriko the firm collapsed before the start of any production. Only one test vehicle and two semi finished ones were ever produced. In 2015 public prosecutors in Spain accused six businessmen involved in the project of fraud. History The concept behind the Hiriko urban electric car was originally conceived by William J. Mitchell and his Smart Cities Research Group at the MIT Media Lab in 2003 as the MIT Car and later the CityCar project. Upon William Mitchell's death, the project was led by Kent Larson, director of the Changing Places Research Group. The commercial development of the Hiriko began in 2010 in the Science park of Alava, Basque Country, by the Spanish consortium Hiriko Driving Mobility in collaboration with the Changing Places Group and the Spanish government, which provided about million ( million) in financial support. The Hiriko Driving Mobility consortium included seven Spanish companies under the promotion and leadership of the Association for the Development and Promotion of Industrial and Sport Activities from Alava (Afypaida), the Basque Center for Innovation Denokinn, and the Entrepreneurship and New Business Development Epsilon Euskadi. A production prototype of the Hiriko Fold was formally unveiled by the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durão Barroso in January 2012. The variable wheelbase concept of the Hiriko first featured in the 1992 Renault Zoom concept car. The folding city car was invented in 1929 by Engelbert Zaschka, a three-wheeler with a single cylinder engine on the rear, which could be disassembled into three pieces. Specifications The Hiriko car is a two-seat all-electric microcar designed to be used for short-distance urban trips intended for car sharing. The microcar is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack that allows a range of . The drive motors are located inside each of the four wheels, and has an electronically controlled maximum speed of . The consortium had plans to develop three versions: the Fold microcar, of which one demonstration car was completed; the Alai, a convertible; and the Laga, a small truck. The Hiriko Fold weighs less than , has an extended length of and its hinged body allow the microcar to retract its front and rear modules, enabling the Hiriko to fold upwards to for parking. This feature allows three and a half Hiriko Folds to fit in a typical urban parking space. Each of the four wheels can turn 60 degrees left or right, enabling the car to travel sideways, which makes parallel parking a very easy maneuver to accomplish, and this flexibility allows the car to spin on its central axis. Furthermore, the battery pack is placed on the vehicle's floor producing a low center of gravity. The driver and the passenger enter and exit the car through the front hatch that houses the windshield. The conventional steering wheel and the brake and throttle controls were replaced with a device similar to an airplane's yoke. When the driver pushes the control stick forward the car speeds up, while when pulled back the car slows down. Turns are made by moving the yoke control left or right.  Demonstration projects  Production aiming for 20 test pre-production cars began in July 2012 in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. These demonstration vehicles were supposed to be used for display and testing. In December 2012, Hiriko and Deutsche Bahn announced an agreement to start a carsharing pilot program in Germany in 2013 to integrate the Hiriko Fold into Deutsche Bahn's railway service to allow their customers the possibility of using a vehicle parked at the station with which to complete the last mile of the journey to their final destinations. The electric car sharing system is called eFlinkster, and Deutsche Bahn operates several of such car sharing fleets. The agreement also included an initial phase in 2013 in which the Hiriko folding was to be tested and adapted for public use in Berlin, and an official and broader roll out was planned for 2014. Production and sales The Hiriko Fold was unveiled in March 2013 at the Geneva Motor Show, and production was scheduled to begin during the second quarter of 2013. Retail deliveries were scheduled to begin in 2014. Pricing was to start at () plus battery leasing fees. The consortium's plan was to sell the Hiriko to municipalities, including Barcelona, Berlin and San Francisco. The company also planned to promote the cars for cities across Europe to expand their carsharing programs. Among others, transport managers from the Basque biosphere reserve of Urdaibai, Ibiza, Hong Kong and Florianópolis in Brazil expressed interest in using the Hiriko in carsharing systems. In June 2013, the Hiriko was formally registered in the Brazilian national registry of intellectual property. In May 2013 the Hiriko consortium announced that they were having difficulties to continue with the commercial development phase due to lack of financing. For the research and development phase, the consortium was granted million (~ million) from the Minister of Industry, and additional million (~ million) from the Basque Government. A government spokeswoman said that Hiriko had fulfilled its research objectives, for which they provided financial support. The government stated that financing for commercial development must come from the private sector and that the Basque Government was willing to continue participating with venture capital funds once the Hiriko obtained official industrial approval for production. The entire project was shut down and its participants laid off, some of whom were suing for severance pay and unpaid wages. The project's assets were frozen in 2015, and some former employees revealed that some parts of the car debuted in 2012 were glued with Velcro and superglue.

Though there are some vegetarians among the populace, a majority of the people use agro, meat and fish products. Fish caught in the seas around the district during the night or early morning hours reach the markets in the interior towns and villages in the early morning. The food is spicy, and the people in the district tend to use more grated coconut in their curries and food-preparations, like neighbouring Kerala. As coconut trees are abundant in this place, the place might have derived its name from them. This village had, in ancient times, trade relations with foreign countries like Arabia.

George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. In this book Hudson synonymised O. similis with O. semifasciata despite Philpott providing distinguishing features for these two species. In 1988 John S. Dugdale disagreed with this synonymising and separately listed the two species. The holotype specimen of O. semifasciata is held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.  Description  The wingspan is 16–18 mm. The head, palpi, and thorax are white mixed with brown and the abdomen is grey. The forewings are elongate, the costa gently arched, the apex subacute, the termen rounded and oblique. They are white, irrorated with shining dark brown, especially on dorsal half. The markings are shining dark brown. The hindwings are light fuscous-grey.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Along with the type locality of Queenstown this species has also been collected near Lake Hakapoua in Fiordland National Park, on Mount Titiroa in Fiordland, at Rastus Burn Basin in The Remarkables at an altitude of 1640m, and around Aoraki/ Mount Cook.

The first issue appeared on 31 May 1910 and the last in February 1922. The magazine played an important role in the development of Afrikaans literature in the aftermath of the Boer War. It promoted a lively interest in the country's history through articles such as those written by Preller on the Voortrekkers. Informative essays on painting and sculpture appeared, with covers designed by artists such as Pierneef and Frans Oerder. For its time it maintained a high literary standard with contributions coming from the foremost Afrikaans poets and writers. These included Jan Celliers, Louis Leipoldt, Totius, Leon Mare and Jochem van Bruggen. From March 1920 'Die Banier', a scientific literary monthly, was issued as a supplement to 'Die Brandwag' and continued to appear for some years after 1922 when 'Die Brandwag' itself had ceased publication. Die Nuwe Brandwag (The New Brandwag) was published over the period 1929 - November 1933 and was edited by Prof. M. L. du Toit and Pierneef. The place of its now defunct predecessor had largely been taken over by another magazine, Die Huisgenoot, so that the focus of Die Nuwe Brandwag was on literature and art of a high standard. Articles on music, sculpture and painting appeared regularly, with a large section devoted to art reproductions. It became a forum for original Afrikaans work in prose, poetry and drama, as well as hosting critiques on Afrikaans, Dutch and English literature, and is regarded by many as one of the best Afrikaans literary publications ever produced.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa (NASOU 1970) On 6 February 1937 Die Brandwag (1937-1965) reappeared as a weekly magazine, published by Afrikaanse Pers Bpk. as a supplement to the daily, Die Vaderland. In August 1937 it became independent under Otto Schwellnus as editor. Its first members of staff included well-known literary figures such as Elisabeth Eybers, Uys Krige and S. Ignatius Mocke. Among its first contributors were the household names of C. M. van den Heever, J. R. L. van Bruggen, N. P. van Wyk Louw, I. D. du Plessis, P. J. Nienaber and Sita de Kock. A. M. van Schoor succeeded Schwellnus, and was in turn replaced by Rud. P. Visser in 1945. The magazine began to feature mainly short stories and popular reading matter, and served as a nursery for thriller writers. In September 1948 the readership topped the 100 000 mark and the magazine had obviously come of age. Nonetheless, changes in editor and format led to its eventual demise in 1965.

It is thought that when adults sit at rest its white head, thorax, and basal portion of wings are of protective value by reason of their resemblance to an opening manuka-bud. Larvae have been found feeding on bird nest debris.

Downtown Whitehorse is a neighbourhood in Whitehorse, Yukon. The downtown area serves as Whitehorse's city centre and central business district. History Downtown Whitehorse originally encompassed the entirety of Whitehorse prior to the Second World War. After the war, the periphery was developed, with residents beginning to move into the Riverdale subdivision on the east bank of the river, and to suburbs outside the city limits such as Porter Creek, then to the Takhini and Hillcrest subdivisions after the military withdrew from the city in 1968. In 1971, the city limits were extended beyond downtown, officially establishing a larger city with the original area now merely the downtown area of a much larger municipal area. Layout The Yukon Legislative Building is located in Downtown Whitehorse. Downtown Whitehorse is the commercial centre of the city. The Yukon Legislative Building is located in this area. It is generally considered to extend from the narrows between the clay cliffs and the Yukon River just south of Taylor Street, north to the east-west leg of the Second Avenue extension, and from the Yukon River to the base of the clay cliffs. Business activities are mainly confined to 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th avenues, as well as adjacent sections of the cross streets, and mainly north of Hanson Street (third street south of Main). The remainder of the downtown is primarily residential. Parks Canada maintains the S.S. Klondike national historic site in the southeast corner of downtown next to Second Avenue and the river; just to its north is Rotary Peace Park; together, these properties historically were squatter areas cleared in the late 1960s, known as Whiskey Flats South. North of this along the river were the waterfront properties most of which were concerns of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway until 1986, when railway interest in retaining these properties waned; most of it is now owned by the city and the territorial government which are focusing on making the area a public area with some businesses and trails; it also has the \\"waterfront trolley\\" operating through the area. Beyond the present extent of Front Street (1st Avenue), there was a second squatter area known as Whiskey Flats North extending to the approximate location of the Wal-Mart store built in 2000; part of this was also where riverboats were moored in the winter, and where two riverboats were lost to fire in 1974. Transportation =Roads= As well as the numbered avenues 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th and the parallel Front Street (officially known for many years as 1st Avenue), the named streets, which also delineate addresses along the avenues, are: Storefronts on Elliott Street.

Association Domà Nunch was founded in 2005 as a spin-off project of the Moviment Spiritual Riformaa Nativ d'Insubria (Reformed Spiritual Movement of Insubria's Natives), previously created in 2003 by Lorenzo Banfi, renewing and reissuing El Dragh Bloeu (The Blue Dragon), which then became the official magazine of the new association.http://www.eldraghbloeu.eu Website closed in 2013 Lorenzo Banfi, linguist and author, led Domà Nunch as president as soon as the organisation got expanded in 2007. Domà Nunch believed in self-determination and independence of Insubria as way to preserve the heritage, history, language and environment of the region. It also promotes the re-unification of portions of Insubria presently split among Lombardy, Piedmont, and Switzerland. Though, Domà Nunch never or limitely defined itself to belong the traditional independentist political area, rather outlining to be \\"national\\" movement. Domà Nunch was opposed to the urbanization and concreting of the land. Particularly, their members had been against new highway projects, such as the Pedemontana Lombarda proposed by the Regional Council of Lombardy. Also, Domà Nunch aimed to maintain taxation locally in Insubria in order to reclaim the land. Temporarily cooperations led to merge Domà Nunch's actions with major campaigning environmentalist organisations, such as WWF, Italia Nostra, Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano and Legambiente. In the first activity period, Domà Nunch had published a number of books on ecology and local language, as well as organised events. These included: * The National Day of Insubria, every 5 September, according to the date of foundation of the Duchy of Milan; * Commemoration of the ICMESA disaster in Seveso; * The Forum on Environmental Emergencies in Insubria, in 2007, Uboldo; * The Forum on the Milanese Language, in 2007, Nerviano, attended by the major linguistic associations of the region; * The conference Olona: A Valley at Its Crossroad, in 2008, Gorla Minore; * Olona: A Valley Festival in 2008; * Street rallies against the A36 (Autostrada Pedemontana Lombarda) project, in 2009 and 2010. In 2010 Domà Nunch replied to the Enlargement of Switzerland motion proposing an integration between Switzerland and Insubria in order to join into a new confederation. Political movement =First Period= In December 2011, Domà Nunch actually ceased its activity as a cultural association and changed into a political movement with the target to run for the 2013 Lombard regional election, though this never actually happened. In February 2012, Domà Nunch provoked the public opinion by issuing a local currency called FranchThe word is equivalent to Lira in Lombard language. stating this would be \\"the money of the people, to save our economy\\". Issued banknotes were portraying hystorical lombard characters like Francesco II Sforza. In September of the same year, Domà Nunch activists had been attacked by individuals linked with left-wing social center and Italian General Confederation of Labour while the econationalists rallying in Desio against Mafia presence in Insubria and Pedemontana motorway construction Domà Nunch claimed CGIL to have responsibility in the tempted assault. After this stage, in April 2013 Domà Nunch signed a cooperation agreement with Terra Insubre, a cultural association based in Varese and Milan that shared most of Domà Nunch's objectives. This led to a convention in Milan on 4 May to remember the Bava- Beccaris massacre. In December 2013 Domà Nunch communicated to put on hold its political activity. =Second Period= At the end of 2014 the movement published and presented the booklet Appunti per una Repubblica Sacra (Notes for a Sacred Republic) stating the \\"felt need to consolidate the definition of the political and spiritual vision\\" and \\"with the intend to outline the peculiarity of the argumentations proposed, and claim in a more official way the paternity of the ideas expressed in the last years\\". In 2015, Domà Nunch announced to take part at the elections for the municipality of Saronno in alliance with Lega Nord The coalition eventually won and the econational movement was assigned a Councillor for Ecology and Sport.. In January 2020 the movement announced to adhere to Fratelli d'Italia both at local and national level \\"being convinced to bring into Giorgia Meloni's party the experience of an econationalist right, radicated in Insubria and for the interest of Italy\\".

Biography In the early 20th century, entrepreneurs and national governments staked claims in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, to develop resources and mining. Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark-Norway all had interests there, soon followed by the Russian Empire. The Earl of Morton had several Arctic interests. He and Alexander Bruce Hugh, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh had major shares in the little-known Spitzbergen Coal and Mineral Ltd of London. In 1906 Morton became involved, with his son Rory, in the Spitzbergen Mining and Exploration Syndicate (SMES). Together with other major investors, they claimed land on the island of Spitsbergen, now Svalbard, Norway, and that year opened a coal mine at Camp Morton.

His name is Melanie Martinsson and he started out as an artist in the year 2000 and is currently signed to Wormfood Records. His music has a mixed style including rap, punk rock, alternative rock, electronica, techno and industrial. He has released 4 mixtapes, 4 EPs and 5 albums, though due to the current music industry's lack of tangible/physical record production/sales, he coined the term 'Dement-O-Vision' to describe the recent digital releases. With a lack of genres to compare his music to, he has also coined the term \\"skräckno\\" as a genre, which is a play of words in Swedish which can be translated into \\"horror-techno.\\" In 2010 Melanie Martinsson and freelance photographer Alexander Donka worked on a photoproject depicting the recording of the latest album. In 2011 the album was successful on a zero marketing budget and sold Gold (20k), on ESC season, and also received the Impala Sales Award. Melanie is Demented has music featured in various films, such as the Truckfighters movie. Melanie has extensively used social networking to build a fanbase. In 2014 Melanieisdemented releases the album Blind, which is a soundtrack to a book with the same title and pseudonym. It is the most costly DIY-project in Sweden to date. The album is a themealbum which accompanies the book. The book is about what would happen if all of the worlds firearms were exchanged with oranges. In 2015 Melanie Is Demented plays a sold-out European tour together with Portuguese indielabel Chili Com Carne, and all profits go to charity. The promoted mixtape get recognised as top five of the year by various papers. In 2016 he releases a critically acclaimed album called We Split Up Searching For You, a project describing the horrors his neighborhood suffered during 2015, with all proceeds going to charity. He is currently working on the followup album Ulsa, a sequel to Blind entitled Kyle's Apartment, a clothing line entitled KKCCBB, and a machine that can only fire human teeth at armor-piercing velocity entitled Grief MK 1.

It is located east-southeast of Fort Yukon, Alaska. It was the former Fort Yukon Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-14, LRR ID: A-01), a General Surveillance Radar station. The ground control intercept (GCI) station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was redesignated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air and Space Operations Center, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. History Fort Yukon AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. The station was opened in 1958 as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station, operated by the 709th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq). The squadron operated AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20, and AN/FPS-6 radars. As a GCI station, the squadron's initial role was to guide interceptor aircraft based at Ladd AFB near Fairbanks toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Later, the station was redesignated as a radar surveillance station, with the squadron providing information 24/7 the Direction Center at Murphy Dome AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The station was known to be the coldest radar station in Alaska, with temperatures sinking as low as -70 degrees Fahrenheit during the winter. Due to the extreme temperatures, most of the site's operations were housed indoors, in a large composite structure consisting of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The inaccessibility made the personnel at the site responsible for maintenance if anything went wrong. Water mains occasionally froze and ruptured. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Fort Yukon site was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Fort Yukon AFS received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program . It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 709th AC&W; Sq was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re- designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Fort Yukon LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Current status Today very little of the former Fort Yukon Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the PACAF's 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is supported by a few civilian contractors who access the site by the Fort Yukon Airport and monitor the system.

Requirement  In 2005, several experts recommended e-governance to develop agriculture and provide services to livestock owners, farmers, and NGOs. The services suggested included timely information during disasters to minimize loss of life and material. The information provided can also help make decisions with data about the market. The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) had several e-governance initiatives in the field of agriculture. States have also implemented such projects. The Agriculture MMP aims to replicate the agricultural e-governance projects being carried in different states at a national level and provide the services through multiple delivery channels such as the centralized agricultural portal, Kisan Centres, touch screens, and mobiles. This project stresses on using IT in all stages of the agricultural crop cycle including the crop selection stage, the pre-cultivation stage, the crop management stage, the pre-harvest stage, the harvesting stage and the post-harvest stage. The project focuses on providing informational services to farmers on a variety of farm-related issues including seeds, soil test-based information, fertilizers, pests, government schemes, and weather.  Work in States  It is proposed to complete the project over a period of 32 months after the approval of the project.

Joseph-Désiré Court (September 14, 1797 – January 23, 1865) was a French painter of historical subjects and portraits. Court was born at Rouen. He became a pupil at the École des Beaux-Arts under Gros, and after carrying off the principal honours there pursued his studies still further at Rome. High expectations were formed of him when he exhibited in 1827 The Death of Caesar, a work manifesting earnest thought, and a conscientious handling of the facts of history. It is now in the Musée Fabre in Montpellier. Having shown himself in this and other works a vigorous painter, capable of seizing a subject with a masterly grasp, and having also in the region of portrait painting proved himself an artist of no common merit, he eventually dissipated his talents in the production of a series of empty official pictures painted by order of Louis Philippe. He died in Paris in 1865. The Bordeaux Museum has a portrait of Henri Fonfrède by him; that of Lyons, a Scene from the Great Flood; that of Rouen, Boissy-d'Anglas saluting the head of Féraud.

He was known for his city views, history paintings, Christian religious scenes and portraits. He spent a substantial part of his early career in Italy before returning to his native Leiden. He was the teacher of the young Rembrandt.Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg was born in Leiden as the son of Isaac Claesz. van Swanenburg. His father was a painter and designer of prints, stained glass windows and other objects and also served multiple times as Leiden's mayor.Willem Isaacsz. van Swanenburg at the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoR.E.O. Ekkart, Isaac Claesz. Van Swanenburg, 1537-1614, Leids schilder en Burgermeester, Zwolle 1998, p. 10 His father had been a pupil of the leading Flemish history Frans Floris in Antwerp and received major civil and religious commissions in Leiden where he was the leading history painter of his time.Jacob van Swanenburg Biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 Amy Golahny, Rembrandt's Reading: The Artist's Bookshelf of Ancient Poetry and History, Amsterdam University Press, 2003, p. 59-64 Jacob had two younger brothers who also became artists: Claes (1572-1652) was a painter while Willem (1580-1612) was a printmaker.Claes Isaacsz. van Swanenburg at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The van Swanenburg family was largely of the Arminian faith and after 1618-1619, Remonstrant. The Last Judgment and the Seven Deadly Sins Van Swanenburg left Holland for Italy but information about his sojourn is scarce. The artist was in Venice around 1591. In Italy he also spent time in Rome as is demonstrated by his View of St. Peter's Square in Rome. He had settled in Naples around 1598. He married on 28 November 1599 Margaretha De Cardone, the daughter of a local grocer. He sold his paintings directly from his workshop in Naples. In 1608 he ran foul of the Neapolitan Inquisition for displaying paintings depicting scenes of witchcraft in his shop. The accusation related to a large canvas depicting a number of witches and devils engaging in perverse acts, which he had displayed outside his shop. During the proceedings van Swanenburg explained that he had only taken out the picture which he had begun three years earlier for cleaning and varnishing. He declared to have studied the art of painting in Venice without a master. He was able to convince the inquisitor of his good character and got off with a severe reprimand. Had the inquisitor known that van Swanenburg was a non- Catholic the punishment would likely have been more severe. The siege of Bethulia Van Swanenburg returned to his native Leiden without his family in 1615. His return may have been related to the death of his father the year before. He travelled back to Naples in 1617 to move his household permanently to Leiden. On 6 January 1618 the artist along with his wife and three surviving children arrived in Leiden. Here van Swanenburg achieved success as a painter and received commissions from local and non-local patrons. He was registered as a master of the young Rembrandt in 1620. While the subjects of van Swanenburg (mainly cityscapes and hell scenes) did not leave a noticeable mark on Rembrandt's work, Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and his interest in artificial lighting may have their roots in van Swanenburg's fiery hell scenes. Rembrandt may also have continued in his work a technique of producing paintings which starts with laying out the composition upon the support in stages, building up the picture from the background to the foreground and applying glazing or finishing layers. He died in 1638 while on a trip to Utrecht. He was buried in the St. Pieter's Kerk in Leiden next to his father. Work The Sibyl showing Aeneas the Underworld, Charon's boat Only about 11 works have been attributed to van Swanenburg. These works deal with two principal subjects: three are city views while eight depict scenes of hell. He is reported to have painted portraits but none have come down to us. The hell scenes deal with different subjects: one sets out all the tortures of inferno, two deal with the story of Pluto and Proserpina from Ovid's Metamorphoses and two include a depiction of the seven deadly sins. Four pictures show the entrance to hell and two of these include the story of Aeneas with the Cumaean Sibyl from Virgil's Aeneid. These references to Ovid and Virgil were not original and were clearly derived from the work of the Flemish painter Jan Brueghel the Elder who had been a pioneer of the hell scene. An example of a hell scene is The Sibyl showing Aeneas the Underworld, Charon's boat (circa 1620, Museum De Lakenhal). The picture shows the god of the underworld, Pluto, steering a chariot across the sky. On the left the boat of Charon carries the souls of the dead to the underworld. In a huge mouth the seven deadly sins are represented through various characters: a reclining woman is the personification of laziness, a love couple of lust, a woman who pulls out her tongue is slander, a woman with a pouch represents avarice, a dressed up lady with a mirror depicts vanity and an eating man intemperance.Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg, Onderwereld met de boot van Charon at the Museum De Lakenhal The scene is further completed with crowds of naked people and monsters engaged in perverse acts, fantastic ships and an eerie background with ancient ruins, flames and clouds of smoke. St. Peter's Square in Rome with a papal procession Van Swanenburg's city views include a biblical scene of The siege of Bethulia (Museum De Lakenhal), which the artist completed in Naples in 1615. It depicts the apocryphal biblical story of the siege of the Jewish mountain town Bethulia by the Babylonians. The most important scene in the lower right corner is barely noticeable. There lies the lifeless body of the Babylonian general Holofernes. He was beheaded by the Jewish heroine Judith, who had cunningly entered his tent, plied him with drink, and then beheaded him.

The reserve has a rich natural and historical life consisting of native plants, a wide range of wildlife consisting of 47 different bird species, local reindeer herds, arctic foxes, and more than 80 archaeological sites. Skálanes works as an independent, non-profit natural science research station and a member of INTERACT - International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic. Skálanes is collaborating with a wide range of International and Icelandic researchers and natural science institutes, hosting week-long excursions for university students and professors, developing educational material for young learners, and engaging with non-scientific communities and crowds offering guided hikes and talks on the local landscape and the natural fauna. The intention of Skálanes is to create an experimental platform for scientific, social and cultural exploration focusing on practical solutions in sustainability and species diversity. Today, Skálanes is collaborating with educational institutions such as: Southern Connecticut State University, Earlham College, Liverpool John Moores University, Wellesley College and University of Glasgow, providing the foundation for a variety of research topics in the fields of natural history, biology, archaeology, anthropology, conservation and ecology. Location Skálanes is located 17 km to the east of the town of Seyðisfjörður in eastern Iceland at 65° 18' 0\\" North, 13° 43' 0\\" West. The Reserve The reserve is roughly 1250 ha in size. The site is bounded by the sea on the north and east and by a continuation of similar land to the south and west. The majority of the land slopes from the skyline (945m) in the south to the sea at the northern edge of the reserve. The coastline along the northern edge of the reserve makes up the southern side of the mouth of the fjord called Seyðisfjorður, whilst the eastern section of coastline consists of sheer sea cliffs reaching up to 600 meters in height. Below is list of the main habitat types found in the reserve: * Marine * Intertidal- rocky sea shore and pebble beach * Cliffs * Riparian * Fresh water wetlands- pools, scrapes, flushes, bogs * Wet pasture * Meadow * Dwarf scrub/woodland communities * Scree slopes * Bare ground * Various stages of successional habitats found upon eroded soils This wealth of habitats provide niches for a wide variety of life. There are at least 150 species of plants, 47 bird species and the 4 Icelandic mammals. Example of collaboration =The University of Glasgow= The Exploration Society (ExSoc) at the University of Glasgow supports young minds to travel, explore and research new environments. The first Iceland Expedition to Skálanes was set up in 2008 and since then a group of around six students has spent the summer months carrying out both individual and group research projects around the reserve. Skálanes provides a landscape and environment ideal for the development of research skills in a broad range of disciplines. Past Projects * The impact of Alaskan Lupin on ground nesting birds * Topographical surveys of archaeological sites * Distribution and shell colour of periwinkles * The impact of nature based tourism on environmental awareness * The breeding success of fulmars, kittiwakes and Arctic terns * The distribution, size and abundance of microplastics Planning The Iceland Expedition is an entirely student-led trip, with each team member having an individual role within the group. The expedition team work in conjunction with Skálanes director Ólafur Örn Pétursson in order to arrange research projects that will both benefit the University of Glasgow and the Skálanes Reserve. The planning process begins in early October with the expedition beginning in the summer the following year. A full report of each expedition is published in the University of Glasgow Library. Many of the expeditions to Skálanes have had financial support from charitable institutions including: Royal Geographical Society, Glasgow Natural History Society and Gilchrist Educational Trust. The expedition is also financed by private fundraising and personal contribution. Projects at Skálanes There are many long term projects that are currently being undertaken in the reserve. =Turf wall / -building construction= The method of using turf for creating boundaries and structures can be seen in many places throughout Iceland and is being used at Skálanes due to its heritage significance and unobtrusiveness when placed in natural environments. The work entails cutting and stacking turf in two lines and filling the centre with soil. The turf is overlapped in each layer similar to bricks in a house and tied together with pieces of turf which bridge the central cavity. The top is then capped with large pieces of turf. =Path work= Essential to present and future visitor management is the creation and upkeep of various paths within the reserve. Staff are currently designing a specification for path construction and starting to lay paths in the most heavily used areas of the reserve. =Re-forestation= Skálanes has an ambitious re-forestation plan covering 111 ha of the site. The tree species used in these plantings are predominantly birch, rowan and willow all of which are Icelandic native species. Various planting methods are being trialed and monitored so that planting efforts are well targeted and efficient. One of the largest areas of planting is located in an area where many fragments of relic woodland and associated ground flora remain. Supplementary planting in this area will hopefully accelerate the process of natural regeneration and encourage the remaining scrubby trees to expand into contiguous woodland. =Lupin control= In recent years there has been some debate surrounding the Nootka lupin (Lupinus nootkatensis) in Iceland. An introduced species used to combat soil erosion, lupin grows well on exposed, eroded soil areas however there is growing concern that in some places it is creeping away unchecked and out competing the native flora which consists of many delicate herbs, wild flowers, grasses and sedges. The lupin at Skálanes is being studied using various methods to help develop a landscape scale plan for the control and removal of this plant. It appears from direct observation within the reserve that there is a considerable loss of biodiversity in the areas that surround the lupin as it encroaches upon and out competes with other species. =Stone wall construction= Using a specification written by a Scottish volunteer from a previous student excursion, the Skálanes staff use stone from the surroundings to create boundary walls and walls for various structures. =Sustainable agriculture= The staff are increasingly looking at making Skálanes more sustainable and is therefore introducing low-impact agriculture to the area around the centre such as vegetable garden and rearing chickens and pigs. =Monitoring & Survey Work= Monitoring and survey work is an important part of the conservation work at Skálanes. There are a wide variety of bird and plant species on the reserve which staff and volunteers surveys and monitor each year.

The garden is currently under construction. When it opens it will showcase all of the native plant species of Oman in a series of created, naturalistic habitats from the dry deserts to the rich monsoon cloud forests. The garden will also showcase the traditionally cultivated crops and the many ways that people use plants in Oman. With this concept, the Oman Botanic Garden is the first of its kind – no other botanic garden is representing the entire flora of one country in habitat settings. It will present an opportunity for visitors to experience the flora and vegetation of Oman while learning about the agricultural heritage, rich cultural traditions and legendary hospitality of the country. The design concept is based on four basic principles: * The native flora is represented in naturalistic habitats * The garden reflects and honours Oman's rich botanical heritage * The garden demonstrates a sustainable approach * The displays are interactive and apply a modern and exciting way of education and interpretation Situated in Al Khoud, about 20 kilometers from the capital Muscat, the Oman Botanic Garden is being developed on 423 hectares. The garden will be the largest botanic garden in the Arabian Peninsula and one of the largest in the world. The garden will consist of the following key components: nursery, visitor center, research center, field study center, outdoor habitat gardens, northern mountain biome, southern mountain biome, and nature reserve area. The Oman Botanic Garden project is built upon a foundation of environmental sensitivity and sustainability. All aspects of the project must support this approach. The project is being built within the limits of a large nature reserve, and as such a “tread lightly” approach must be followed, both in concept and in construction. As a part of its main objective, Oman Botanic Garden is helping to create a more sustainable world, throughout its design, construction and operation. The project is applying for certification for some of the buildings through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), operated by the US Green Building Council. This places stringent criteria on energy efficiency, sourcing and use of materials, minimising the use of resources and communicating best practice. Flora and vegetation of Oman The Sultanate of Oman in the southern Arabian Peninsula is mainly characterised by arid habitats, with much of the region occupied by sand dunes or rock and gravel desert. However, and often in stark contrast to the deserts, the country also contains a seasonal cloud forest, open juniper woodlands and other habitats supporting high species diversity with many endemic plants. Oman lies in the transition zone between the Holarctic and Palaeotropical kingdoms, as well as between subtropical and tropical climate zones. This position is reflected by the presence of plant species from several biogeographical regions as demonstrated by the comparatively high number of vascular plants in Oman. A period of intensified botanical research in Oman has taken place over the last two decades. There has been good progress extending our knowledge of the flora of Oman, resulting in the description of 103 new range-restricted species since 1980 and the documentation of new records for the country (Patzelt, 2014). However, detailed studies of the vegetation and plant communities are still scarce and current knowledge ranges from no documentation at all to brief descriptions of the vegetation types or to characterisation of the vegetation units by their complete floristic composition and arranged in a hierarchical system of floristic similarity. Data are also lacking regarding the population parameters and ecology of individual plant species. Oman has a total of 191 range-restricted species, representing 13.6% of the total flora (Patzelt, 2014). This high proportion of range-restricted species (endemics, near endemics and regional endemics) in the Sultanate can be explained by a unique combination of ecological factors that restricted the range of species in the past. Endemics are found in all vegetation types throughout the country. However, some habitats are particularly rich in range-restricted species and are of special interest, encompassing sites of maximum biodiversity. Significant species-rich habitats include the monsoon-affected mountains in southern Oman, the northern Hajar mountains, and the coastal areas of the central desert; these areas represent local centres of plant endemism. History and development of Oman Botanic Garden Following a Royal Decree in 2006 by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, the Oman Botanic Garden project was initiated. The scale and complexity of the project is such that the design and construction work has been divided into multiple phases. Construction of the Oman Botanic Garden started in 2007 with the construction of a native plants nursery on site. The on-site nursery was constructed in 2008 and has been fully functional since then. The nursery now houses one of the largest documented collections of Arabian plants in the world, with ca. 70,000 plants in cultivation. The garden also houses a seed bank with currently ca. 5 million seeds. Most seeds are collected from the wild, with verification levels close to 100%. Many of the architectural, landscape architectural and infrastructure components of Oman Botanic Garden are currently under design or construction, at varying levels of completion, while the plant collection is being grown. The Oman Botanic Garden is not only Oman's leading institution of National Plant Collections, but is already regarded as one of the world's most interesting botanic gardens. Oman Botanic Garden staff The current staff structure consists of five departments: Botany and Conservation, Living Collections, Education and Communication, Operations, and Corporate Services. To date, the garden employs 80 staff, including four international experts and 76 Omani nationals. Several of the team are recruits from the local village, enabling the involvement of the local community with the project and helping to ensure that the benefits and information about the project are shared - an important aspect of the project's sustainability focus. Plants collections in Oman Botanic Garden The plant collections of the Oman Botanic Garden include living plants in the nursery, seeds in the seed bank and preserved plants in the herbarium. The plants currently grown in the nursery represent the largest scientific and documented collection of Arabian Plants on earth. Only very few of the plants of Oman have been propagated or cultivated before, so the work of the nursery is greatly increasing the knowledge and understanding of the country's flora. The Oman Botanic Garden botanist and horticulture teams collect plants as seeds and cuttings through regular field trips; hundreds of expeditions have taken placeto all areas and habitats of the country to collect, monitor and record invaluable data about Oman's plants and habitats. The majority of the native plants of Oman which will be planted in the Oman Botanic Garden are not available commercially. Therefore, the botany team has spent thousands of days on field expeditions to collect seed and other plant material to build up the collection. Seeds are collected and the plants are propagated for the first time ever at the Oman Botanic Garden nursery. The overall vision of the habitat gardens is to represent a specific habitat at its best. A habitat design is not a formal design, but rather provides a true representation of the plants in their natural environments. The native plants of Oman will also be used in the amenity areas of the garden, outside of the habitats, to showcase the design potential of using native Omani plants in the landscape. Research in Oman Botanic Garden Oman Botanic Garden conducts active research in the areas of flora and vegetation of Oman, propagation and cultivation of native plant species, ethnobotany, plant pests and diseases, and designing with native species. The garden helps to protect the plant diversity of Oman through botanical and horticultural research and conservation. The Oman Botanic Garden Herbarium currently 1800 holds plant vouchers, which are arranged systematically. The herbarium is open to visitors. The garden will also conduct plant genetics research once the research facilities are constructed and ready to use. The Oman Botanic Garden will form a key part of Oman's response to the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, part of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Education and communication in Oman Botanic Garden Environmental education is at the heart of the garden and one of its key functions. Through the work of the Oman Botanic Gardens, visitors will be encouraged to respect and care for the country's indigenous natural environment and learn more about the fascinating cultural connection that exists between plants and people and value all that Oman stands for. Oman Botanic Garden currently develops tests and runs school programmes, programmes for university students, and for other visitor groups. Course material is being developed and further refined. The garden works together with the relevant Ministries, to ensure that the programme of the garden ties in the country's curricula. A temporary visitor centre is used for pre-booked visiting groups and school parties. The garden's website can be accessed at www.omanbotanicgarden.com. Global botanic garden context There are currently 2,200 botanic gardens known in the world in nearly 150 countries, but there are very few in the Middle East and South-West Asia, although the area is home to an estimated 60,000 plant species. The flora of the Arabian Peninsula has so far been poorly represented in any botanic garden on a global scale. Botanic gardens worldwide do not adequately reflect the Arabian plant diversity and number of collections is the smallest of all botanic garden living plant material. Oman has a rich and unique botanical heritage and has taken regional leadership in environmental issues. The garden will be the first in the world to grow only the native species of a region, planted in scientifically accurate, natural habitat gardens. The respect and value for plant diversity conservation fostered by the Oman Botanic Garden represents a major global step forward in global plant conservation efforts.

(2005). Grant is the founder of MAMA Film Worx and the WSFF film festival and brand.  Career  In the late 1970s Grant was an influential figure on the London and New York club scene, where he worked as an actor and singer. In the early 1980s Grant became a part of the New Romantic movement in London, and in 1984, at the age of 23, was named “London's youngest club entrepreneur” by Time Out magazine for establishing the new concept of ‘One Nighters’ at Legends in Mayfair. By 1986 Grant had moved into property and project development. In 1993 Grant started working with Thompson Holdings overseeing several of the group's main interests, such as Windsor Racecourse, Queens Park Rangers F.C. premier league football club and the Portuguese luxury resort Quinta Do Lago. Grant and Thompson then co-founded the film production company Pagoda (1998), which in 2000 saw its first commercial success with the film Gangster No. 1 starring Paul Bettany and Malcolm McDowell. Grant left Thompson Holdings in 2004, to become an independent filmmaker and to establish the independent film production company Shipwreck Film, where he shot four short films, as well as his first feature What's Your Name 41? (2005) starring Con O'Neill and Ann Mitchell. The film was shown at several international film festivals, including Raindance Film Festival, the Berlin International Directors Lounge and the California Independent Film Festival. Grant subsequently wrote, directed and produced three further feature films: Just Inès (2010); Coffee Sex You (2014); and Open My Eyes (2016). Just Inès starring the French actress Caroline Ducey was premiered at the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival (2010) and was subsequently screened at the Cairo International Film Festival and FEST Belgrade, Serbia.

They did not acquire their WH classification until 1908 when WMR was nationalised and incorporated into the New Zealand Government Railways (NZR). A total of five locomotives were purchased by the WMR but two had been sold by the time NZR took over the company.  Introduction  The first locomotives purchased by the WMR were five 2-6-2T light tank locomotives, to be used for construction work and then for local traffic. The WMR engineer in charge of construction Harry Higginson sent his requirements to the WMR’s agent in London Sir Julius Vogel in 1883. Mr Bromley drew up detailed drawings and specifications, and a tender was awarded in January 1884 to Manning Wardle of Leeds, England. The first locomotive was tested at Leeds by Mr Bromley, who was killed in a railway accident at Bulhouse while returning to London.  Service  No. 1 & 2 arrived at Wellington on the SS Aorangi on 15 September, and Nos. 4 & 5 on the SS Ionic arrived on 28 January 1885. No. 1 was tested at the Petone NZR workshops, and found to have tight bearings, with Higginson rebutting rumours printed in the Evening Post that it was of unsatisfactory design and manufacture.. At least one locomotive arrived fitted with Howell’s copper coated steel tubes which were a failure and had to be replaced with copper tubes (according to WMR annual reports). Their centre drivers were flangeless; and the smokeboxes were too short (possibly because of the coal used) so were extended within a couple of years. The extension improved their performance, if not their appearance. The first engine was eagerly awaited in September 1884, as the formation to Johnsonville was ready for tracklaying and ballasting, but the WMR had unsuccessfully tried to hire a locomotive from the Government in August 1884. The last two were shipped to Wanganui after erection at Wellington to provide much-needed motive power at the isolated Longburn end. These engines were expected to haul 70 tons up the 1 in 40 grade to Johnsonville; and two in tandem could be used to Johnsonville, with only one proceeding to Paekakariki. For the easier run to Longburn a faster tender locomotive was required, and three engines similar to the NZR V class were ordered in 1883. The tank engines were averaging about 24,000 miles each in 1887-88 but about 17,000 miles each in 1889. By 1892, half of the running of Nos. 2, 3 & 5 was for track maintenance work (some 25,000 miles) and half for shunting and Wellington-Paekakariki banking. No. 5 required repairs in 1887-88 and 1892.  Disposals  Two locomotives, WMR Nos. 3 and 5 (Manning Wardle Nos. 922 and 924), were sold to the Timaru Harbour Board in 1901. No. 5 was sold for £1000, and arrived in Timaru on 26 February 1901. No. 3 was reassembled at Addington, and reached Timaru on 22 April 1901. They were written off by WMR at the end of the 1900-01 financial year (No. 5) and in the 1901-02 financial year (No. 3). The mileage to 29/2/1908 (but presumably only for WMR service) is given as 219,999 miles (No. 3) and 211,602 miles (No. 5). Later, one was sold to the Mount Somers Tramway in the 1930s, and the other scrapped.  Later service  Three remaining locomotives, WMR Nos. 1, 2 and 4 (Manning Wardle Nos. 920, 921, and 923) were taken over by the NZR in 1908, and classified as the WH class. The NZR numbers were Nos. 447 (305,825 miles), 448 (319,724 miles), and 449 (346,162 miles) respectively; with the WMR mileage to 29 February 1908 given in brackets.

History The castle was built in the 13th century by Theodoric, a knight in the service of Countess Ermesinde of Luxembourg. It was captured and burnt down by the Burgundians. In 1574, Paul von der Veltz transformed the building into a comfortable castle in the Renaissance style. The keep had large windows and the property was surrounded by a protective wall with seven towers. Finely vaulted ceilings were erected over the rooms on the ground floor and the first floor. The Knights' Hall on the second floor has a magnificent chimney. The arms of 16 noblemen decorated the walls. In 1603, the castle was again destroyed by the Dutch. In 1635, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle and the village were left in a sorry state. However, around 1700, it was once again repaired, this time by Johann-Friedrich von Elter who rebuilt the gate and appended his coat of arms. The chapel was restored in 1717 by von Elter. The altar bears the arms of the castle's heiress, Charlotte von Elter.\\"Mersch Castle\\", Commune de Mersch. Retrieved 15 March 2011. In 1898, the Sonnenberg- Reinach family sold the castle to a businessman called Schwartz-Hallinger. In 1930, restoration work was carried out by the owner M. Uhres. In 1938, a youth hostel was housed in a new building adjacent to the castle. From 1957, the commune acquired the building but sold it to the State of Luxembourg in 1960. As a result of an exchange agreement, the commune finally regained ownership in 1988 and undertook substantial renovation work for the needs of itse administrative services which now occupy the building.

He was selected because of his thoughtful demeanor and supposed wisdom, but the Pennsylvania Gazette frequently painted the man as deranged ostensibly because of the editor's daughter being rejected for a marriage proposal. Until the session of 1714, harmony prevailed between the assembly and the governor, but the remainder of his term of office was stormy. On 15 February 1714, the day for the convening of the assembly, the weather was severe, and a quorum failed to assemble. This embittered him, and when, on the following day, an organization was effected, he roundly abused the committee sent to him, and drove them from his door. He once removed all the chief justices of New Castle County for doing their duty in an action against his brother-in-law, leaving the county without a magistrate for six weeks. At another time, when the judges of the Supreme Court at New Castle refused to permit a certain commission of his to be published in court, he sent for one of the judges and kicked him. These events had upset many citizens in the areas under Gookin’s jurisdiction. Lawyer Andrew Hamilton was indicted before the Governor’s Grand Jury for cursing and arguing against Gookin. The case would later be dismissed. The breach made by his eccentricities widened until 1717, when, on petition of the council, he was removed.

The new patriarch formally requested and received ecclesiastical communion from Pope Benedict XVI on 24 March 2011 pursuant to Canon 76 § 2 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. The Mass for the inauguration of his Patriarchate took place on 25 March 2011, in Bkerké, the see of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate. As is customary for all Maronite Patriarchs, Patriarch al-Rahi took the additional name Boutros, that of Saint Peter, who briefly held the See of Antioch before moving to Rome to become Bishop there. On 7 March 2012, Patriarch al-Rahi was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.

Cardinal al-Rahi is also the first Maronite Cardinal Patriarch ever to participate in a papal conclave. He was named a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education by Pope Francis on 30 November 2013.http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2013/11/30/0795/01791.html On 18 March 2015 al-Rahi became the sole cardinal-elector from the order of cardinal-bishops when Cardinal Naguib turned 80. He remained the sole cardinal-bishop elector until 28 June 2018 when four Latin church cardinals of voting age from the priestly and diaconal orders were elevated by Pope Francis to cardinal-bishop by having their titular churches co-opted to suburbicarian rank and Louis Raphaël I Sako, Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church was created a cardinal-patriarch. Cardinal al-Rahi ceased to be a cardinal-elector on his 80th birthday in 2020. Political views In April 2011, al-Rahi said that, for the sake of communion and love, he would work \\"to establish a sincere and complete dialogue\\" with Muslims \\"and build together a future in common life and cooperation.\\" He said his predecessor \\"struggled with insistence to free both the national decision-making and the land of Lebanon from all forms of tutelage and occupation, worked for reconciliation in Mount Lebanon and realized needed church reforms. All of these constitute an extension of the church's springtime started by the Second Vatican Council.\\" Patriarch al-Rahi does not use the term \\"Arab Spring\\", but \\"Arab Winter\\" to express his unenthusiastic reaction. =Syria and Hezbollah= In September 2011, some of the Christian supporters of the March 14 alliance were upset over his controversial comments in Paris, France where he supported Hezbollah's right to hold arms in defense against Israel, and stated that the 2011 Syrian protests could awaken the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood if President Bashar al-Assad was removed from office. 14 March supporters stressed how his predecessor had very different views and was almost fanatically supportive of the Lebanese Forces. Christian supporters of the March 8 alliance welcomed his comments. Prime Minister Najib Mikati also supported his stance saying \\"The Maronite patriarch spoke about a part [of the problem]. No one is against the resistance’s arms as long as Israeli occupation continues. There is Lebanese unanimity on the resistance’s arms in the face of Israeli occupation.\\" Mikati said after his meeting with al-Rahi that he was \\"very relieved and reassured by the Patriarch’s wisdom.\\" President Michel Suleiman said that \\"the Patriarch is not in need of anyone to defend him and his positions emanate from his central role as a person in charge of Lebanon's and the Middle East's Christians and that of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty;\\" and that \\"the patriarch does not need to be defended, and his stances represent his way of taking responsibility for Lebanon's Christians.\\" Parliament speaker Nabih Berri said that al-Rahi's \\"comments in Paris protect Lebanon from danger and I agree with what he stated and affirm his vision that is rooted in both a religious and national background\\" and that \\"If the situation further deteriorated in Syria and we reached a more radical rule than the current rule, like the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood, Christians there would pay the price, either in the form of killings or displacement. Here is the picture of Iraq in front of us.\\" Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun expressed support for al-Rahi: \\"Rai’s statements express the concerns of the minorities because he is entrusted with the Synod for the Middle East. Gradual changes doesn’t harm stability and wouldn’t get Syria into the [same] troubles as Palestine, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. [As some of the Syrian demonstrators are armed and are destroying the country] the Syrian government cannot but bring order to the country.\\" Former 14 March Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt criticised al-Rahi's assessment on the grounds that \\"Lebanon cannot remain hostage to regional conflicts\\", and denied that regime change in Syria was posing a threat to Christians in the country. In an interview with Reuters on 4 March 2012, al- Rahi said: \\"All regimes in the Arab world have Islam as a state religion, except for Syria. It stands out for not saying it is an Islamic state...The closest thing to democracy [in the Arab world] is Syria.\\" =Visit to the Holy Land= On 26 May 2014, the patriarch decided to join Pope Francis on parts of the pontifical three-day Holy Land pilgrimage. The Maronite patriarch arrived late Sunday in Jerusalem after accompanying Francis in the West Bank, but he departed from the parts of the Catholic leader's itinerary that involved meetings with Israeli officials. After visiting a monastery outside the city on his way to Jaffa, al-Rahi joined the Pope again in the afternoon for Mass at Jerusalem's Cenacle. The patriarch then returned to the West Bank for a visit to Beit Sahour, toured the north, the Galilee region, Nazareth, Acre and Haifa, where many of the country's Arab Christian minority live. The visit was criticized at home. The patriarch maintained that he was misunderstood and that his journey was celebrating the roots of Christianity in the region.

Both sexes have four discal spots which are usually visible dorsally as well as ventrally. Adults have been recorded year round, except June on the North Island. The main flight period is October to March. There seem to be two generations per year, but may breed continuously during mild winters. The eggs are usually deposited in January and February. They are almost hemispherical, slightly ovate, flattened, pale bluish-green in colour, covered with numerous very slight hexagonal depressions. As the enclosed embryo develops, small irregular reddish-brown patches appear on the surface of the egg-shell. The larvae have been recorded feeding on Cyathea and Dicksonia species. First- instar larva are very pale ochreous brown, with two wavy orange-red subdorsal lines. Full-grown larvae are about 32 mm long and pale rusty brown with an obscure pale-brown dorsal line.

History In 1491 the old temple was built but in 1997 the temple was redeveloped by villagers. With the Bramhlin Param Pujya Shree Gagangiri Maharaj the Suvarna kalash is placed on Champashasti. Thus Champashasti has been celebrated as a festival since 1997. Programs of Satsangs used to be arranged on that day. Nearly 15 laks people visit the temple every year. One can see part of District Ahmednagar, and Pune can be seen from temple. Roads from these two districts come here. Under Pradhanmantri Gramsadak Yojna street-lights, toilets, Sambhamandap and Dharmashala are being built. The movie named Korthancha Khanderaya was produced here, which also helped to make Devasthan popular. The temple has its own Audio & Video cassettes too. The government of Maharashtra awarded the temple into group \\"B\\" (\\"B\\" group temple foundation gave Khandoba Devasthan 70 laks for doing work on temple), so more facilities and management may be possible. About Devasthan From ancient times Lord Khandoba has been worshiped in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Goa of India. His deity is a form of Lord Shiva. On Hindu month Margashish and the day of \\"Shukla 6\\", Champashasti is celebrated as \\"Shree Khandoba Avtaar Diwas\\". On Paush poornima Shree Khandoba wed with Mhalsabai; thus we celebrate grand Yatra Mohotsav. On this day many people from Maharashtra as well as Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Goa come. The statue of Khandoba is thought to not have been made by anyone, but rather is self-generated; thus it is called Kor than, here. Kor means \\"untouched\\". Yatra This temple has a grand yatra of the god Khandoba every year on the Hindu month of Paush and the day of the poornima. This grand celebration lasts three days. The second day of yatra has a very popular bullock cart race locally called the Gaade. This racing generally consists of a pair of bullocks with Bhandara on their whole body. Sometimes the bullocks are led by a horse and a man sitting on it. A specially dedicated track is made for this event on the right side of the temple. Then, the second new track is made at Bhandara Doongar (hill), but in 2011 this race was carried out at the far left of the temple. The third day of the yatra is called Kathya. Kathya generally stands for the long wooden stick (nearly 35–50 feet), covered by various colored cloths, which is roped to give support. The first kadthi to arrive at the temple is of Brahmanwada kathi' it is called as \\"Manachi Kathi\\". The other villages kathya (from Belhe and Aale) follows it. When this kathya touches the top of temple (Kalash), the yatra of the God Khandoba is declared finished.

It is the oldest Czech Presbyterian congregation in the US, having been founded in 1877, and the church building was opened in 1888. The church is named for Jan Hus, a Bohemian priest who was a theologian and reformer. The church is in the area that was once known as Little Bohemia. Once a center of the Czech community, the church now has a diversified inclusionist congregation. The church ran an active Neighborhood House that promoted music, theater, and culture and operated a homeless outreach program. The church basement includes a 150-seat theatre that was home to Gilbert and Sullivan performing groups almost continuously from 1952 to 1975. Chicago City Limits performed there throughout the 1980s. Since then, several arts organizations have been based at the theatre. In 2019, the Session of Jan Hus Presbyterian sold the church building located at 351 East 74th Street, New York City, New York, in Manhattan's Upper East Side to purchase a more modern facility to meet the growing needs of the congregation and their large community outreach missions. Their new property, located at 1745 First Avenue, New York City, New York, is scheduled to open in early 2020. History The church was founded in 1877 when Gustav Alexy, a Hungarian missionary, wanted to work among the Czech community. The building was designed by R.H. Robertson and built in 1888, and bears the inscription \\"Truth Prevails\\", a famous Jan Hus saying. The church sits down the block from the Byzantine Moderne-style Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. When Pastor Alexy died in 1880, the newly official Presbyterian Church asked 21-year-old Vincent Pisek to take over as leader. At the turn of the century Czech families immigrated to America in large numbers settling in New York. The followers of Jan Hus had been persecuted or forced out of Bohemia. Pisek was \\"free-thinking\\" and performed marriages between men and women from different ethnic groups. His enthusiasm to help make these marriages was a part of what helped to build his church. With thousands of Czech parishioners when the church started, the congregation has changed greatly with the Czech community dispersing over the years. By the 1950s, Jan Hus Church was no longer predominantly Czech. Jan Hus Church has not had a Czech pastor since the 1960s. Ray Bagnuolo became the pastor August 2, 2009. Jan Hus was among the first churches to become an Open and Affirming congregation for the full inclusion of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender people in church life The church is now one of many congregations associated with More Light Presbyterians. Jan Hus Neighborhood House Through the efforts Vincenc Pisek of Malesov, the successor of Gustav Alexy of Roznov, the new modern Czech Brethren Presbyterian House was built in 1888. Among its many community efforts Jan Hus Church organized a homeless outreach program called HOAP. The program HOAP assists more than 50 guests with immediate responses to their physical needs. The program also allows the homeless to use the church's address for their mailing address, and receives mail for over 500 people. In 1888, the J.H. & C.S. Odell Company installed a \\"Size No. 9\\" organ in the church, The Odell Size 9 organ had a case of \\"appropriate and approved design, made of Walnut, Chestnut, or Ash,\\" with \\"the large speaking pipes displayed in front to be gilded, silvered, or richly ornamented in gold and colors.\\" The organ measured high, 11 feet, 3 inches wide, and 7 feet, 3 inches deep. This organ was removed in 1969 by Alan Laufman and Guy Henderson, but the organ case and display pipes were left in the church.Dunlap, David W. From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004. Like many churches in New York City, Jan Hus rents out its space for community and artistic events; however, Jan Hus has been dedicated to this mission for its community for decades. In 1914, Atherton Pisek and the Jan Hus community raised funds to open the Neighborhood House and in 1915, the church built its Neighborhood House to celebrate Czech culture: the folk music, the dance, marionette theatre, and music. Located on the easternmost portion of our building, the Neighborhood House was to be a cultural and social center for the Bohemian people, a place for art and music, job training, a dental clinic, clubs, athletics, language classes and more. While expanded beyond the Czech community, the Neighborhood House continues to promote music, theater, and culture. Jan Hus Playhouse Theater The Jan Hus theater has presented and housed several art events and organizations. *From 1952 to 1967, the 150-seat theater served as the home of the American Savoyards. *In May 1960, The Actors' Co-op performed a revival of the Insect Comedy, with Barbra Streisand in her first New York role. *From 1969 to 1975, the theater became the home of LOOM (Light Opera of Manhattan), which was an Off-Broadway repertory theater company performing 52 weeks per year. Both LOOM and the American Savoyards employed comedian Raymond Allen. *From 1981 to 1992, Chicago City Limits (a New York City improv comedy troupe) made Jan Hus their home. Chicago City Limits performed seven nights a week, with Friday night serving as Stand-Up Comedian Night, hosting Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart, Paul Reiser, Brett Butler, Larry Miller, and Bill Irwin. *The Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theatre Company was also based at Jan Hus in the 1990s. The puppets that helped found the marionette theater company were discovered at Jan Hus Church. *Since 2006, The Remarkable Theater Brigade used Jan Hus as their home for several productions. In 2007, Remarkable Theater Brigade brought Vox Novus and its Composer's Voice Concert Series to Jan Hus Church where the two organizations in collaboration with Jan Hus have a monthly concert performance since June of that year. In 2008, Remarkable Theater Brigade produced GLORY DENIED, an opera by Tom Cipullo adapted from a book by journalist Tom Philpott about Jim Thompson, the longest-held American prisoner of war in Vietnam. * Several other art performances and art organizations have performed at Jah Hus Playhouse, including: Kenny & The Virgin Mary, 2006 international Electro-Acoustic Music Festival, and the Jan Hus Homeless Theatre Troupe.

John Martin Harvey had been playing Carton in the play since 1899 and it was his most popular work. It cost £24,000 to make and was shot at Twickenham Studios.Low p.134 The film was a commercial success and reportedly took over £53,000 in its first two years on release. It was a particularly notable achievement given the collapse in British film production between the Slump of 1924 and the passage of the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 designed to support British film making. Synopsis In 1770s France Doctor Manette is witness to the rape of a young woman Jeanne Defarge and the murder of her and brother Jacques by the powerful Marquis d'Evremonde. In order to silence Manette, d'Evremonde arranges to have him locked away in the infamous Bastille Prison where he remains for over a decade. Manette's young daughter is able to be spirited out of the country to England by her guardian the British banker Jarvis Lorry, where she is brought up by Miss Pross. Ernest Defarge swears vengeance on d'Evremonde and will not rest until the entire family has been wiped out. Many years later Doctor Manette is released. His time in the Bastille has left him institutionalised and he initially finds it hard to adjust to life outside the prison. Jarvis Lorry and Manette's now-grown daughter Lucy come to Paris to escort him to England. On the journey back they encounter a young man named Charles Darnay, who is the son of Marquis d'Evremonde, fleeing France because his liberal views clash with those of his father. Darnay and Lucy soon fall in love, but their hopes of marriage are threatened when Darnay is arrested on his arrival in England for espionage and high treason as an alleged French spy. Darnay's accuser is the unscrupulous Barsad, who is himself in the pay of the French government. Darnay's defence case is worked on by an dissolute Englishman, Sidney Carton, whose young idealism has given away to a self-loathing cynicism. Carton bears a striking resemblance to Darnay and uses this in court to discredit Barsad's evidence in court, by raising doubts over Barsad's claims that he clearly saw and heard Darnay talking treason. Darnay is acquitted, and he plans to marry Lucy. Carton is befriended by Lucy, and developing an unrequited attachment for her, he tries to mend his ways and give up his heavy drinking. In France, the oppression of the poor finally drives them to breaking point and the French Revolution breaks out. Evremonde, who has been particularly exploitative of his tenants, is murdered in his bed by Ernest Defarge and Charles Darnay inherits his title as Marquis. Desperate to get their hands on the new aristocrat, Defarge and his colleagues trick Darnay into returning to France to assist an old faithful family servant who is now in trouble. Darnay is arrested and accused of being both an aristocrat and a British spy. Carton has traveled to Paris with Lucy, Lorry and others to try to help Darnay. He pleads Darnay's case and points out how liberal his views are and how he hated his father. He adds by pointing out that Darnay had been accused of treason in Britain and was hated there, to discredit the accusation of espionage. Darnay is released, but Defarge is determined to wipe out the last of the d'Evremondes. He has Darnay re-arrested after producing an ancient letter written by Doctor Manette condemning all Evremondes and this shifts the court against Darnay, who is sentenced to be executed by guillotine. Realising that Darnay is now facing almost certain death, Carton hatches an outlandish plan to switch places with him based on their facial similarities. He bribes his way into the prison, smuggles Darnay out and takes his place in the condemned cell. In sparing Darnay's life, and securing Lucy's happiness, Carton is able to restore his long vanished sense of self-worth. The following day, while Lucy and Darnay escape safely from Paris, he goes to his death calmly and at peace with himself and the world The film, like the play, adds a character named Mimi who is a young waif who is rescued by Carton and works in his house. She becomes devoted to him and elects to die on the guillotine with him after killing Ernest Defarge in self-defence.

In 1999, she gained a prize from the Académie des Beaux-Arts and in 2000 the music prize of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques for her numerous lyric pieces. Life and work Isabelle Aboulker was born in the Parisian suburb of Boulogne- Billancourt. Her father was the Algerian-born film director and writer Marcel Aboulker and her maternal grandfather was the composer Henry Février. While following a course in composition and keyboard studies at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris, she started composing for the theatre, the cinema and television. She then worked for the Conservatoire as their chief accompanist and voice teacher and authored several educational works. In 1980, she turned to composing operas and subsequently many other vocal works. Because of her work with children, Isabelle Aboulker made a particular speciality of composing pieces, which would appeal to them or in which they could participate, as they do in Les Fables enchantées, based on the work of Jean de la Fontaine.Sound files from this work are on the Benzekry Musico- Collège site Other subjects have included Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella and Tom Thumb (Petit Poucet). Among her work for adults are two operas based on plays by Eugène Ionesco and settings of poems by Guillevic and Charles Cros. In 1998, she was commissioned by the Orchestre de Picardie to write the oratorio L'Homme qui titubait dans la guerre to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the ending of World War I and this was subsequently chosen to represent France when Weimar became European city of culture in 1999.

It played a minor and relatively unremarkable part in the campaign: whilst passing through the Bay of Biscay the fleet was hit by a tempest, forcing the four lightly built ships of the galley squadron to take shelter in French ports. One galley, the Diana, ran aground in the harbour entrance at Bayonne, but the crew, including the galley slaves who rowed the ship, were rescued; the Bazana and the other two ships took around ten days to repair their storm damage, and subsequently returned to Spain. The Bazana owes its fame to a highly fictitionalized account of its fate associated with David Gwynne, a Welsh prisoner who was forced to serve in the Armada as a galley slave. According to this version, the Diana sank with the loss of all hands when the squadron were still far from port, and the captain of the Bazana appealed to Gwynne's skill as a seaman in the hope that he could save the ship; Gwynne exploited the situation to get the slaves freed from their shackles, enabling them to kill the Spanish crew and seize the ship using homemade stilettos. Next, this version claims, another galley, the Royal (i.e. the Capitana or flagship), attempted to attack them, but Gwynne and the other freed slaves boarded the larger ship, massacred the second Spanish crew and sailed both ships to Bayonne. Gwynne's story was popularized as a propaganda in the Dutch Revolt, and came to be treated as fact by many English historians of the nineteenth century, inspiring Theodore Watts-Dunton in, The Jubilee Greeting at Spithead to the Men of Greater Britain.Shippen pp. 90-91Beeton p. 456Hake p. 285 The reality was exposed in the 1880s by the Spanish naval historian Capitan de Navio Cesáreo Fernández Duro, who argued that Gwynn was even aboard the Diana rather than the Bazana: he and some other English galley slaves simply absconded, or were allowed to depart, after the squadron reached harbour in France. Duro's findings were communicated to the English audience by Prof. Sir John Knox Laughton in 1894.Laughton, Introduction, pp. lxxvii-lxxix, citing Duro i. 65, ii. 279.

It was established on the Ebana River, a tributary of the Abukuma River, west of the city office of Sukagawa City. Construction on the dam commenced in 1937 and it was completed in 1949 after construction was halted due to World War II. The dam's primary purpose was irrigation. It failed on 11 March 2011 after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Failure Empty reservoir and dam after collapse On 11 March 2011, the dam failed 20 to 25 minutes after the Tōhoku earthquake as the nearly full reservoir overtopped the dam's crest. Locals reported hearing a loud burst before seeing a flood. The flood washed away five houses while damaging others, disabling a bridge and blocked roads with debris. Eight people were missing and four bodies were discovered after searches began at dawn. On 12 March 252 dams were inspected and seven dams were found to be damaged. Six embankment dams had shallow cracking on their crests and the reservoir at one concrete gravity dam had a slight slope failure. Four dams, including the Fujinuma, were inaccessible and could not be inspected. A preliminary survey of the dam and facilities conducted in April 2011 noted that the breach occurred at the tallest section of the dam. Within the dam's fill, there were layers of organic residual soil that in one area contained a tree stump. The residual soil was used as foundation and in layers as well – above alluvium. This suggests that the foundation for the dam was not prepared properly, according to the study. In addition, the reservoir's auxiliary dam suffered a severe slope failure on its upstream face while areas around the rim of the reservoir had mild slope failures or distress. It could not be confirmed whether the earthquake or a quick draining of the reservoir was the cause of this. Design The dam was a tall and long embankment-type with a structural volume of and crest width of . About to the south, there is an auxiliary dam with a height of about and length of approximately . The auxiliary dam helped the reservoir maintain it designed levels given the topography wouldn't allow the single main dam to do so.

The document is classified and stamped as secret. The resolution of the Comintern of January 11, 1934, was an official political document, in which for the first time, an authoritative international organization has recognized the existence of a separate Macedonian nation and Macedonian language.Duncan Perry, \\"The Republic of Macedonia: finding its way\\" in Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parrot (eds.), Politics, power and the struggle for Democracy in South-Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 228-229.  Background  At that time there were few historians, ethnographers or linguists who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation and language existed.Dennis P. Hupchick states that \\"the obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the communist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian\\". Dennis P. Hupchick, Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe, Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, p. 143.Loring M. Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Princeton University Press, 1997, , p. 65. In early 20th century among the majority of the Slavs in the region of Macedonia coexisted pro-Bulgarian ethnic sentiments and regional Macedonian identity.During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift. \\"Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe\\", Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, , p. 127 The partition of the Ottoman Macedonia between Balkan nation-states after the conclusion of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia). As result part of the Slav inhabitants of the region emigrated to Bulgarian Macedonia. Under Serbian control in Vardar Macedonia the locals faced with the policy of forced Serbianisation.Dejan Djokić, Yugoslavism: histories of a failed idea, 1918–1992, University of Wisconsin Press, 2003 , p. 117. The Greek governments also began promulgating a policy of persecution of the use of Slavic dialects both in public and in private, as well of expressions of any ethnic distinctiveness. In 1919 and 1927 population exchange agreements were signed and the bulk of the Slavic-speaking population in Greece left for Bulgaria. In this way the Bulgarian community in most of the area began to reduce, either by population exchanges or by change of its ethnic identity.Ivo Banac, The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 33.  Resolution  In June 1931 the registrar of the Comintern Otto Kuusinen in his report on the national question to the Executive Committee, suggested that the main weakness of the Comintern was the insufficient appreciation of the national questions.К у у с и н е н, О. Слабият участък от фронта на Коминтерна. — Комунистическо знаме, VIII. 1931, № 9, с. 19. Kuusinen called to discuss the national question in order to develop a new national program for each of the parties. Meanwhile, to the Balkan communist parties a directive was provided, for the gradual abandonment of the slogan of the Balkan Federation, highlighting in its foreground the \\"right of the distinct peoples of self-determination to a full separation\\". The reason for this political turning, was the rising of Nazism in Germany. Thus in 1932 a members of the Comintern sponsored IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation.Произходът на македонската нация - Стенограма от заседание на Македонския Научен Институт в София през 1947 г. This question was discussed among them, however, there was a split when Vasil Hadzhikimov and his group, refused to agree that the Macedonians are a separate people from the Bulgarians. Nevertheless, the highest institutions of the Comintern were informed about this issue from Dino Kyosev who gave a lecture in Moscow in 1933 on the distinct Macedonian national consciousness. As result in the autumn of 1933 the Macedonian Dimitar Vlahov - leader of the IMRO (United) and former Bulgarian diplomat, was summoned in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings.Мемоари на Димитър Влахов. Скопје, 1970, стр. 356. At one of them the Executive Committee ordered the leading cadres of the Balkan Secretariate, Valecki - a Pole, and Šmeral - a Czech, to draw up a special resolution on the issue. Because they had no concept of this problem, using Vlahov's help the resolution yet had been prepared.Balkan Studies: Biannual Publication of the Institute for Balkan Studies, Hidryma Meletōn Chersonēsou tou Haimou (Thessalonikē, Greece), 1994, p. 363. Vlahov claims, before the convening of the consultation the leadership had already its stand that the Macedonian nation exists.Dimitar Vlahov, Memoirs, Skopje, Nova Makedonija, 1970, str. 357. So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Comintern adopted its final decision on the Macedonian Question about the existence of a Macedonian nation.Who are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, , p. 98. The basis of the new concept was the common view that the region of Macedonia is one of the pivots of future imperialist war and therefore the Comintern seeks an option to blunt the contradictions between the countries that possess it. This decision by the Comintern was the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation.Палешутски, Костадин. Югославската комунистическа партия и македонският въпрос, 1919–1945, Издателство на Българската Академия на Науките, София 1985, стр. 223. According to Vlahov, that was precisely what happened in Moscow in 1934: > \\"I mentioned earlier that the Comintern itself wanted the Macedonian > Question to be considered at one of the consultations of its executive > committee. One day I was informed that the consultation would be held. And > so it was. Before the convening of the consultation, the inner leadership of > the committee had already reached its stand, including the question of > Macedonian nation, and charged the Balkan Secretariat with the drafting of > corresponding resolution... In the resolution, which we published in the > Makedonsko Delo in 1934, it was concluded that the Macedonian nation > exists\\".The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics, Ivo > Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 328. He also mentioned that the resolution had a hostile reception both from members of the Bulgarian Communist Party and of the IMRO (United), residing in Moskow.Balkan Currents: Studies in the History, Culture and Society of a Divided Land, Basil P. Caloyeras, Lawrence A. Tritle, Loyola Marymount Univ, 1998, , p. 108. Vlahov himself was a member of both organizations and a Soviet spy,Разведка и контрразведка в лицах: энциклопедический словарь российских спецслужб, Анатолий Валентинович Диенко, Клуб ветеранов госбезопасности (Руссия), Издател Русскій міръ, 2002 стр. 97. who declared himself until then as a Bulgarian.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 105.According to the Macedonian historian Academician Ivan Katardzhiev all left-wing Macedonian revolutionaries from the period until the early 1930s declared themselves as \\"Bulgarians\\" and he asserts that the political separatism of some Macedonian revolutionaties toward official Bulgarian policy was yet only political phenomenon without ethnic character. This will bring even Dimitar Vlahov on the session of the Politburo of the Macedonian communist party in 1948, when speaking of the existence of the Macedonian nation, to say that in 1932 (when left wing of IMRO issued for the first time the idea of separate Macedonian nation) a mistake was made. Katardzhiev claims all this veterans from IMRO (United) and Bulgarian communist party remained only at the level of political, not of national separatism. Thus, they practically continued to feel themselves as Bulgarians, i.e. they didn't developed clear national separatist position even in Communist Yugoslavia. Академик Катарџиев, Иван. Верувам во националниот имунитет на македонецот, интервју за списание „Форум“, 22 jули 2000, број 329. He accepted the decision without any personal reaction or substantive comment, that confirms he was operating in fact as a Communist agent.Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2008, , p. 142. However, the Resolution didn't ever mention the ineffectual Vlahov as a leader of the IMRO (United).Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Archon Books, 1971, , p. 48. The Resolution was published for the first time in the April issue of the IMRO (United) magazine \\"Makedonsko Delo\\".Македонско дело, бр. 185, IV. 1934. Following the decision of the Comintern, IMRO (United) took as its slogan \\"the right of the Macedonian people to self- determination up to secession\\" and formation of \\"Macedonian Republic of working masses\\". Despite the fact that this was formally a Resolution of IMRO (United), it was a document adopted by the Comintern, which was immediately published in all the mouthpieces of this international communist centre. Afterwards the mainstream Bulgarian public opinion has maintained that the Comintern is the \\"inventor\\" of the idea about the existence of a separate Macedonian nation.Macedonia: Warlords and Rebels in the Balkans, John Phillips, I.B.Tauris, 2004, , p. 37.  Significance  Prior to the Second World War, this views on the Macedonian issue had been of little practical importance. During the War the macedonist ideas were further developed by the Yugoslav Communist Partisans, although some researchers doubt that even at that time the Macedonian Slavs identified themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world, Loring M. Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, , pp. 65-66. After the Red Army entered the Balkans in the late 1944, new communist regimes came into power in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and their policy on the Macedonian Question was committed to the Resolution of supporting the development of a distinct ethnic Macedonian identity. A separate Macedonian language also was codified in 1945.

He was of Welsh origin, and in February 1704, became deputy governor of the province, under the proprietor, William Penn. He was not a Quaker, and was doubtless selected out of deference to the court party, who did not believe in the peace principles of that sect. His administration was marked by quarrels with the assembly, and especially with the speaker of the house, David Lloyd, who headed the popular party. Disregarding the convictions of the Quakers, Evans, for the first time in the history of the colony, made a public call for troops, with the desire of assisting the other colonies against the French and Indians. The call met with no response, whereupon the governor, resorting to a discreditable ruse, arranged to have a messenger ride into Philadelphia on the day of the annual fair, announcing, with apparent consternation, that the French had arrived in the Delaware and were marching on the city. Evans then rode through the street with drawn sword, entreating the people to arm, and for a time great excitement prevailed. Valuables were hastily thrown into wells, and many people fled to the forests; but the Quakers, on whom Evans had wished to make an impression, continued quietly at their devotions, as it was the day for their \\"weekly meeting.\\" The governor also built a fort at Newcastle, and unlawfully demanded tribute of all vessels passing up the river. One of his tax enforcers was captured by a ship he had been trying to tax and carried off to the Jersey side of the river where a furious Lord Cornbury (who had charter rights to regulate commerce on the river) upbraided him, whereupon Evans gave up on his tax. Evans had a good deal of learning and refinement, but his habits were unsuited to the Quaker City. Watson, in his \\"Annals of Philadelphia,\\" says that in 1702 \\"Solomon Cresson, going his round at night, entered a tavern to suppress a riotous assembly, and found there John Evans, Esq., the governor, who fell to beating Cresson.\\" Evans was finally recalled in February 1709, and was succeeded by Colonel Charles Gookin. On 28 August 1709, he married Rebecca Moore in Philadelphia. After surrendering his office to Gookin, he remained for a time in Philadelphia but at length retired to Denbigh, Wales.

These, which are equally popular, include tent pegging, volleyball, football, stone-lifting, and Kabaddi thousands of people flock to these local grand sporting events as keenly as the average sports fan anywhere in the world. Horse and rider in action, this animal went on to win Among all the sports, one of the most thrilling and adventurous is Tent Pegging, played in teams as well as solo. It is one of the most popular equestrian sports. The native Marwari and Kathiawari breeds excel in the sport and many breeders are actively attempting to reintroduce the breed and the sport into the mainstream. Although there is a difference of opinion as to how and where it started, it is almost certain that tent-pegging is a sport of Asian origin. One source dates it use during the invasion of the Indus region by Alexander the Great in 326 B.C. which lends credence to the belief that the sport originated in the North Western provinces of the subcontinent in what is now Pakistan, This is where Alexander had entered India. The cavalry soldiers of Alexander were believed to have used tent-pegging as a battle tactic against the elephants in the army of the Indian King Porus, who in Jhelum fought bravely against the invaders, lost the battle, but by virtue of his heroic demeanor, charmed Alexander to return Porus his kingdom and make him his friend. Tent pegging aids in hand to eye co-ordination and keeps one fit even in later yearsThere is also a belief that the sport became popular due to the horse-mounted soldiers charging enemy camps at the crack of dawn removing the pegs which held the tents in place, with the tips of their sharp spears. The Vice President of the Mudgeeraba Troop, Australia Arthur Domain, who is also training his officers for tent pegging explains that tent pegging is actually a sport, \\"It came about from the Pakistani and Indian armies when they had time on their hands up on the borders; to break the boredom, they invented the sport we now call tent pegging. In the early days they used the wooden pegs that they used to drive in the ground to hold the tents up; and then the other forms of the sport evolved from that. It just gives the riders good hand-eye coordination and makes them better horsemen. But most equestrian sports authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in these areas since ancient times in the battlefields as a tactic used by the horsed cavalry against elephant mounted troops. The soldiers discovered that the best way to make the elephants ineffective was to attack them on their toe nails with sharp spears from the back of a galloping horse. In order to perfect this technique, the cavalry started the practice of tent-pegging which eventually turned into the modern sport. Regardless of its exact origin, tent-pegging is now a popular equestrian sport in many countries around the world. These days the rider uses either a lance or a sword and charges at a full gallop across the arena and attempts to pick up the wooden/cardboard pegs firmly wedged in the ground. This can be done individually or in a team. The most distinguishing features of the native pure bred horse are its lyre-shaped ears, which curve inward and often meet at the tips. Besides providing a sharp hearing, they can turn 180 degrees. Effectively blocking the ingress of the desert sand and dusty plains which are prevalent in this area. The coat is silky and often has the metallic shine of the Turkmeni horses. It comes in all colours, including piebald and skewbald The breeds most popular and proficient in the sport are the local native horses including the now well publiciesed Marwari horse and Kathiawari breeds. Ancient vedic texts compiled over the period of early-to-mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE describe the Jhelum area as being part of Kamboja kingdom, dominated by Hun or Gujjar or Gurjara warrior classes excelling at hand-to-hand combat, horsemanship and a mercenary attitude. The war horses of Kamboja were famous in the Mahabharata and prehistory. In the great battle fought on the fields of Kurukshetra, the fastest and powerful horses of the Huns in Kamboja were of greatest service. These horses are renowned since millennia for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. About 20 miles from Jhelum in January 1849 the Battle of Chillianwala against the British took place. The British although superior in numbers and weaponry were thoroughly defeated, It was the main reason why they later established Jhelum as a Garrison town. When the Moguls ruled northern India in the early 16th century they used Turkoman horses to supplement the breeding of these local Marwari horses. During the late 16th century, the Moghul emperor Akbar, retained a cavalry force of 50,000 strong. It was believed that these local Marwari horses would only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions – victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. When the British took over India it was essential that this ability was removed from the natives. Further, they enacted Criminal Tribes Act to prevent the established warriors from training and breeding these horses. They also passed laws preventing the native Gentry and Noblemen land owning rights, removing their ability to maintain or train cavalry. It was only 300 years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British. The horses thrived through centuries of political turmoil, until the arrival of the British decimated the breed in the first half of the 20th century. The British officers denigrated these local breeds as too undersized and hot tempered, importing shiploads of cheap Australian Whalers, thoroughbreds and polo ponies. They reduced the reputation of the Marwari to the point where even the genetically recessive trait of the breeds inward-turning ears were mocked as the \\"mark of a native horse\\". In reality the horses were cheap, hardy and extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, they were also well practised in complex riding maneuvers so an underlying threat to the British military. Consequently, thousands of Marwari were shot, sold off for cheap labor, castrated or indiscriminately cross bred. Over time, instead of keeping Marwari horses, the local gentry bought expensive thoroughbreds or Australian mounts that were high maintenance and unsuited to battle training or the environment. Having surrendered their very raison d’etre, the regions former kings and nobles lost a fundamental part of their soul and left their heritage and traditions behind. In recent years popularity of Tent Pegging and horse dance has generated revival of the breed and sport in Jhelum as well as further afield in America and the UK. Despite the military refusing to acknowledge or embrace the breeds qualities, A few horses have held out at small local farms with some dedicated trainers and eventers reintroducing the essentially qualities that make this breed proficient in the battlefields and a joy to own and ride. The Pride and the Passion Bulls being led to the race rostrum or plaranh Besides tent pegging there is the sport of Bull racing or dhand melas. There is an established circuit of these melas that have been held annually for decades. It includes Kantrili Chakmal near Gujerat, Nathuwala, and Jada which is a suburb of Kala Gujran These events usually take place every year from February through to May. They include probably the largest assortment of prized bulls competing for honour and cash prizes. Not only do they perform their best but they do it in a gloriously stylish way. The grace of a highly trained pair of bulls without any persuasion or prompting from the owners in front of thousands of spectators is matchless ...everything is picture perfect. The keen competitive spirit at these events has been known to generate unlikely rivalries and alliances as the bulls are traded with an alarming increase of monetary values. The sport has had significantly positive impact on animal husbandry as well as regenerating ancient and forgotten farming techniques which given the nature of the land, the people and the environment are vitally importantThousands watching the bulls in action The tent pegging event and dhand mela photographed for this article was held in Kantrili, a village some few kilometers away from Jhelum, there were around 200 riders and 25 equestrian clubs from all over the Punjab taking part. There are also around 70-100 pairs of bulls going through to the finals and three winners are usually declared. It is a source of immense pride and prestige for the owners of the animals and their handlers. The events are usually lavishly sponsored by the UK based Pakistani diaspora and thousands of people come every year to see these events which take place over three days. Prizes usually including cash, cattle and motor cycles are given out to the winners.
